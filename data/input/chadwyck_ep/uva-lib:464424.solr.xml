      <field name="fulltext">FIRST COLLECTION CAMPO-MUSÆ, OR THE FIELD-MUSINGS OF Captain George Wither, touching his Military Ingagement for the KING and Parliament, THE Justnesse of the same, and the present distractions of these Islands. DEUS dabit his quoque finem. To the ENGLISH. Am not I now in England? Is not this The Thames? Is not that London? Sure it is. Me thinks that vast, and ancient structure, there, Looks just like Pauls, and that like Westminster. Loe, yon is High-gate, yon is Hamsted-mill, There Bansted-downes, there Kent, there Shooters-hill. This doubtlesse is that Countrey: but why then, Are here now living so few Englishmen? Are all those English-men which now I see? All true-bred English-men? the Devill they be. Indeed I finde there are a few among them; And for their sakes I will not so much wrong them To say, the Land hath none, within whose veines The blood of our old Worthies yet remaines. But, out of question, if the greatest part Were not a mungrell brood, and without heart, They could not lie so tamely in their beds, And see what Plague their Countrey over-spreads; Yea seem content, to be inslav'd to slaves, And carie guilt, and curses to their graves. Perhaps they are asleep. Ho! Englishmen! Awake, and be your selves, yet, once agen. Heark, how the Trumpet sounds! heark how the Drum Beats up, and cals in English, Come, Come, Come! Heark, how the ghosts of your poore Brethren, slain and massacred in Ireland, do complain And call for vengeance! heark, how loud they cry, And threaten, if you passe their murthers by! Heark, how the countrey round about you mourns! See in how many parts it flames and burns! Mark, what a desolation, in one year, Is broken in among us! and, how near Our just and everlasting ruine drawes If we become no warmer in this Cause! And that your cooled zeal may re-inflame, Take up this Paper, and new light the same. CAMPO-MUSÆ, OR, The Field-Musings of Captaine George Wither. To his Excellence the Earle of ESSEX, Lord Generall of the Army raised for defence of the KING, Parliament, and Kingdome. The Contents. A Question presuppos'd, the Muse Replieth, and her freedome shewes: Tels with what heart, with what intent, This Warre her POET under-went. Averres that Reason and the Lawes Will justifie him in his Cause: The publike woe, she doth expresse; Lamenteth, and implores redresse: Fights Combats with Delusive-Reason, Her Partie to acquit from Treason, Their hearts incourageth to doe What GOD, and Nature calls them to. And many matters here and there Inserteth, not related here. Then, mentioneth a Voice of PEACE That she hath heard; and there doth cease; Intending, ere She will proceed, To make some proofe, how this may speed. Yes; now Ile write againe, and neither care Though nor Apollo aid me, nor the NINE: Nor whether Mars or Mercury appeare Crosse; or in Sextile, Quadrine, or in Trine. Nor carefull am I whether HEE, or SHEE, Be pleased or displeased with my Muse: For, none to sooth or vexe my Musings be; But, now I write, because I cannot chuse. To answer each mans curious expectation Who asks why thus I said, why this I do; Is not the scope of my determination, Though somwhat here conduces thereunto. The Sword hath had his turn, and now the Pen Advanced is to play her part agen. The naked Svvord and Pen my Cornet bears; Pro Rege, Lege, Grege thereupon To be my Motto for the Field, it wears; And shewes for whom this Warfare we begun. But, Rymes and Reason growing out of date, And Pens (lesse modest now then heretofore) Such lies and railings have divulg'd, of late, That I once thought to touch my Pen no more. Besides (with griefe) I have observ'd in those Whose judgments have most need of Reformation, That there is left no pow'r in Verse or Prose, To make them wise, or move to reformation. For Wisdomes Charmes, and Reasons best conclusions Beget but Furies, and inlarge Confusions. Yet since my muzings when I shall be dead, (And lie unactive in a loanly roome) May peradventure to good use be read, By men reserv'd for better times to come: And, since it will not onely be an ease To mine own heart, my num'rous thoughts to vent, But also may some honest Readers please, Ev'n in these times of gen'rall discontent. Yea, lest malignant censures passed on My late ingagement for the publike peace, Should (if I silent to my grave had gone) Have caused false-opinion to increase, My Pen I re-assum'd, in hope, to shew My practice never prov'd my words untrue. My Pen I re-assum'd; and (full of matter) Sate down to write: but, ere I ought exprest, The Trumpet sounding, all my thoughts did scatter, And gave me, since that houre, but little rest. Destructive times, distractive muzings yeeld, Expect not therefore method now of me, But such as fits Minerva in the Field, Where Interruptions and Confusions be. Like or dislike, I somwhat now shall say Which must be heard; and heard to purpose too; At least in gaining heed, or making way For what (if need require) is yet to do. When sin and self-conceit befools the wise, They must be taught by those whom they despise. For, let not these Field-muzings be suppos'd The fruitlesse flashings of a Giddy-wit, Because in measur'd-words they are compos'd, Which many judge for serious works unfit: Nor let them counted be a sleight invention, Though souldier-like blunt complements I use, That I may draw those fools to give attention, Who will not els perhaps regard my Muse. He that hath matter that concerns the King, Comes not and ringles at the doore with feare; But knocks, untill he makes the pallace ring, And spurns it open, if they will not heare: Ev'n so do I; and think I have done well To make my language like the tale I tell. If I shall mention what some would not hear, The fault's not mine; for, if men madly do, I am a thing which once in twenty year Shall seem to be a kind of mad man too. And though mean-while my Calling I pursue, (Seeming to heed the times as they do me) Yet I am alwayes mindfull of my kue, And act my part when I my time shall see. One while I chide; somtimes faire words I give To praise men into what I fain would have them: And when those Favours I misplac'd perceive, I call them backe, and am asham'd I gave them. When thus I faile, my Fancie prompts me then; But, now another Spirit guides my Pen. I will not blame the Times, though bad they be, Nor to the jeering world bemoane my Lot: For, to these dayes my God appointed me, And guards me so, that mischiefe hurts me not. My Birth I had in blest ELIZA'S reigne; To JAMES, I blaz'd the sins of wanton Peace, For those rewards which Truth will ever gaine, Where Nobles rise by Pieties decrease. To CHARLES I shew'd what Plagues were drawing neare, And, saw them come, e're I beleefe could gaine. And, when they came, I saw the chiefest care Was, how each Foole his Bable might obtaine. For, warnings are on wilfull sinners lost, Till honour, pleasure, life and soule it cost. SIN not repented, (but augmented rather) The Violl, poured forth, began to spread; The spreading mischiefe still more strength did gather, And, every day new Plagues the poison bred. Divisions then arose, which did increase, And, into Sub-divisions branch about, Which overthrew the Pillars of our Peace, And, drove good Order, Law, and Iustice out. These Evils, with my Pen, I long withstood, And, bold reproofes in Tyrants faces threw; But, when I saw my Pen could doe no good, With other Patriots my Sword I drew: For, who that weares a Sword needs feare to draw, To save the King, the People, and the Law? I drew it not in rage, or private hate, Or to incroach on Prince or Peoples-right, Or to recrute a ruined estate; But, that both Prince and People guard it might. I was not arm'd to violate the Crowne, Or please the fancies of a fickle braine, To set one up, and pull another downe, Or Schisme, or Superstition to maintaine: But, fought our Fathers honour to defend; Our Mother, from his jealous rage to save; To bring their base abusers to that end, Which Traiterous-flatterers deserve to have: And he that armes himselfe to this intent Shall ne're be shamed, though he may be shent. I therefore boldly marched to the Field, Not unresolv'd, or stagg'ring in the Cause. I made my Pray'rs my shot, Firm-faith my shield; My Breast-works are Good-Conscience, and the Lawes. I stood not off, when I was called on, To mark what Peeres or Commons led the way; To think I might be made, or quite undone, Or whether side was like to get the day. But of the Publike Ruine was my feare, Or, of those Plagues for which the Sword makes roome; And of the barbarousnesse which every where Is like to follow, where his followers come. And could have wish'd it had as easie bin To drive out mischiefes, as to fetch them in. The cure propos'd, though very sharp it be, And threatens losse of members, and of blood; Before it was adventur'd on by me, Appeared needfull for the Common-good. According to my Fortune and my Place I therefore further'd it, not discontent, Though others had the publike thank and grace For that, which I in private did invent. Where I then liv'd, I was the first of those Who did contribute to my Countries aid; And (though it may be censur'd by her Foes An evill signe) I joy to heare it said That in those parts I was the first of all To whom a totall Plunder did befall. And sure it was for good it so befell: For, he that is inrowled for the Wars Shall never prosecute that Calling well If he intangled be with other Cares. Affaires of Peace effeminate the Minde; A Barne well filled, and a house well fraught, Are not with ease, for poverty resign'd Till they from us, or we from them are caught. For, who those things can willingly forsake, Of which, he feeles he may have daily need? Who can to wants and wounds himselfe betake, That may at home, with ease, on Plenties feed? Or who can fight that's clog'd with Carts and Ploughs. Books, Houshold stuffe, Teems, Oxen, Sheep and Cows? Such things as these did ne're affect me much, But for their sakes, of whom I must have care: Nor did their losse my heart so nearly touch As their neglects, who thereof Causers were: For, if my Counsels had beene duly heeded, And my Presages timely beene beleev'd, The Rage of War had not so far proceeded, As me to Rob, and others to have griev'd: Yea, had the Castle (to my care committed Without supply of mony, meat, or Men Save my halfe Troope) been well and timely fitted With what was needfull, and long sought, e're then, I should not sure, from thence have called bin, To let the Kingdomes foes come safely in. Nor to their dammage, or their detriment, Who me to that command had freely chose, Had I unto another place been sent, Exposing them, unarmed, to their foes: Nor (when a Groundwork I had also laid, Which had, not onely, probably secur'd Those parts, from that whereof they were afraid, But, also, to the Bordering Shires assur'd Good likelihoods of safety) should my Care And Propositions, have been quite neglected, By those, to whom they first proposed were; If they, the Cause, or Me, had well affected: Nor had so ill (thereby) our Partie sped: Nor had our Foes, by that meanes, gather'd head. Nay, if an Envie of the place I had, Or some designe of theirs who brake their Trust, Had not the way for my removall made To let in mischiefe, at a nick so just, So many had not mustred been, so soone (Of my Malignant Neighbours in that Shire) To force my House; my Goods to ceaze upon, And, shew such malice, and such fury there. Nor had I met affronts in other kindes As I have done; But that among us, be Some, that doe walk our wayes, with other mindes, With other hopes, and purposes, then we: But, let them take their course, my Course is weigh'd; And, Words nor Deeds, shall make my heart afraid. What I resolv'd on, hath had firme foundations, Not laid in sands, or built upon with sticks, Nor garnished with vaine Imaginations, Or kept repair'd with Fallacies and tricks. I was not frighted by the Proclamations Penn'd by abusers of the Royall-Name: Nor startled by those tedious Declarations, Which with more Wit then Truth, full fraughted came. I knew how Lawyers and Divines had cheated The World ere then; and when the holy-Text, Or Lawes were misapply'd or misrepeated, Or, with false Comments wrested, or perplext. And, falshood moves not me, although it brings The Votes of Doctors, and the threats of Kings. My heart, the storms of danger did not shake, Faire promises (which have so many caught) On me, the least impression could not make, Though where I serve I scarce worth heed am thought. Nor was I moved much to see, that some (Who Stars appear'd) in their first Love did faile, Because I knew the time was fully come, Which tryes our firmnesse by the Dragons-taile. Nor start I at their Censures, who have said, That, what I counsell'd, I have left undone; That, from my owne Predictions I have straid, And made them erre, if they amisse have gone. For, they that have mistaken Truth-divine, And, wrest Gods Word, may soone misconstrue mine. To say in Words, that so, or so, I meant, I thought not halfe so pow'rfull as to show By active proofes, the truth of my intent, And teach by Deeds, which way men ought to goe. When therefore that great Counsel call'd for aid (With whom the King-ship alwayes doth reside, In whose Commands, the Kings are best obey'd, From whom, the King cannot himselfe divide) To serve the King and Parliament, I came So loyally, that, if it Treason be, I will not ask a pardon for the same; Nor thanke him for it, who shall give it me: But laugh at him, who should that Trifle bring, Disdaine to live; and dye, and be a King. For, no man honours; no man loveth more The Soveraigne-Person, then I did, and doe. For him, I therefore feared, long before, What Ill-advisers now have brought him to. I told him when he was but newly crown'd, (As plainly as my Warrant gave me leave) Those things which He and We too true have found, Yet still misinformations Him deceive. Yea, though the stile of Rebell now I beare, My Prayers for him, have before the LORD Stood eighteen years; and, yet before him are, (To testifie my love) upon Brit. Rememb. Cant. 1. Record, And all his Captains, Armes and Armies too Secure him not, as those my Prayers doe. That which I prayd for then, and pray for yet, I fight for now: Because, I held this, ever, That, whatsoe're to pray for should be fit, For that we are obliged to endeavour. I know thrt by Allegiance I am bound To what effentially thereto pertaines; Not to bare Complements, or to the sound Which of that Duty, lying flattry faignes, Much lesse to that which totally destroyes This Virtues essence; and whereby the King Our loyaltie against himselfe imployes, And to destruction, his owne House may bring. Such mischeeves, therefore, that I might prevent, I sided for Him, with his Parliament. Thereby to serve two Masters I assaid, Till I by their Divisions was undone: And saw three Kingdomes by some Acts ill plaid, In danger to be neither two nor one. I sided not, but as a Stander-by, Who hath two friends at ods, and loving either, Feares that in one, the losse of both may lye, And (in those two) of all his joyes together. If either I oppose, I doe it more To save then wound: and to prevent that blow Which, he that gave it, in his heart had bore, If through that other, we had let it goe. And, he that thinks this duty doth him wrong, May finde a Friend, but shall not keep him long. I moved not thus far, but by Command Of Soveraigne-Pow'r, whereto if it be Treason To yeeld Obedience, we must understand, They Trayters are, who walk by Law and Reason. The Soveraigne-Person may command that thing For which, the Soveraigne-Pow'r, if I shall doe it, Me to the Gallowes for my paines may bring. And hang me with my Pardon when I show it. Because when Soveraigne-Pow'r doth ought command, Therein, the Soveraigne-Person is contain'd So fully, that by Law, no deed can stand In opposition thereunto maintain'd. And, he by whom this Truth is not beleev'd, Is taught by Fooles, or else by Knaves deceiv'd. Nor King nor Parliament doe I affect For private ends; nor did they e're bestow On me, the least appearance of respect More then what they to all men use to show: Nor can I hope that what I doe or write (Till men grow better) an effect shall bring Sufficient to preserve me from despight Though favour'd both by Parliament and King: How then, or by what bait have I been caught That I for Balams wages have been said To contradict the Brit. Rememb. Messages I brought? And from my owne good Counsels to have straid? Or who can say whose tongue it shall become, That my Allegiance I have swerved from? As elsewhere I have writ, so write I here, No hand against the King, that is, no hand We should against his Royall-Person reare Though he injoyn'd a tyrannous command. Nor should a private-man, or private-pow'r Take armes against him, though he should intend Them, in their innocencie to devoure, Not meerly their owne persons to defend. For should each petty member of a State Be armed at his pleasure, for Offence, Their breaches of the peace would ruinate Themselves, the whole Republicke, and the Prince. And, should a King from violence, not be free, Till God shall strike; none so unsafe as he. Yet, when by wicked Counsellers misled, A King, shall his whole Kingdome so oppresse, That, he, therewith appeares indangered; Me thinks, it were a Tenet reasonlesse, To say, there were not in a Parliament Such, as is our (or if no such we had) No powre in his Liege-people, to prevent The hazard of a consequence, so bad: Or, that they might not lay upon their King A charitable, and restraining-hand, To stop him from pursuing that rash thing, Which might undoe himselfe, and all the Land: Or, that there were not nat'rally a right In Them, against his will, for Him, to fight. When by the fawnings of some cunning-whore, A nat'rall Father shall be so misled, As that he beats his children out of doore, And causelesse drives their mother from his bed, Beleeving they are bastards, she unchaste; And, fir'd with jealousies, attempteth further, To burne his house, to lay his dwellings waste, And, with his family, himselfe to murther: As, then, that Family, with an intent, Him, from his ill-advisers, to withdraw, (And his and their destruction to prevent) May lay restraining hands, by Natures law, On such a father, and yet therein be Preserv'd from breach of houshold-duties, free. So, when the Father of our Country, shall By Flatteries, be drawne to such a course, As may produce his owne and Kingdomes fall, Vnlesse we intervene, by timely force; And, when, so loyally, the same is done, That, to our utmost powers, we still assay Not how to save his life, and rights, alone, But, how his honour, too, preserve we may; The Lawes of God, of Nature, and of Reason, Will, doubtlesse, warrant it, in their despight Who brand it with Rebellion, and with Treason; By shamefull Termes, from lawfull deeds, to fright; Els, cut-throat Parasites, are onely they Whom for the truest Liege-men, count we may. That, we have thus ingenuously proceeded, Nor waging war, nor our distrusts revealing, Till our affaires those actions highly needed, (And, made each Grievance fully ripe for telling) Our conscience assure us; though the flanders Of our Opposers, have our Truths beli'd, And led the people through those dark Mæanders, Which our faire dealings, and their frauds, may hide. And, therefore, should the King, by wilfull stay Among that crew, miscarry in the fight, (Which to prevent, we still shall watch and pray) Vpon our heads the blame should not alight; For, who that woes the Plague, hath health assur'd? Or, who can save, what will not be secur'd? I came (as I professe) with single heart, To stay the mischiefe, which I saw begun; And, entred, with my Sword, to act that part Which, without blame, I knew not how to shun. For, when God cals for blood, and will not heare Our pray'rs, untill (his Justice to appease) Those Beasts, among us, sacrificed are Whose life prolong'd, prolongeth our disease; 'Tis time we should observe, that we, like Saul, Those Flocks, and those Amalakites, have spar'd, Whose preservation may become our Fall; If his commands no better we regard. 'Tis time, thought I, that in the gap we stand, To stop the breach, that els will drown the land, The Red-horse then appear'd; and thereupon That Rider forth advanc'd, at whose command Those bloudy executions must be done, Which both defile and purge, a sinfull Land. A mixed multitude made up our Traine, Which God, for divers ends, together brought: Some, to avenge his cause; some, to be slaine; Some, that Repentance might in them be wrought. Our Army being rais'd, the Trumpet sounds; The Colours are displaid, the Drums do beat: To make a passage, thorow bloud and wounds, For Iustice, Truth, and Peace, we forward set. And, whilst we marcht, my heart, with thoughts confus'd, Was over-fild; and thus I sadly mus'd. Those dreadfull Tragedies, must I, O LORD! Must I, not onely now survive to see. Which were so long time fear'd, and so abhor'd? But live, in them, an Actor too, to be? Is that abused Peace which we injoy'd, So many years (whilst ev'ry other State Was plagu'd with war, and some nigh quite destroid) In these our Islands, now, grown out of date? Have we prolong'd Repentance, till the Flame Which from the neighb'ring Countries did appeare (Like Beacons, given warning of the same) Spreads, and devoures, with no lesse fury, here? And, is the time now come, in which this Nation Must pledge them in thy Cup of indignation? Who did so much as dreame, some years agoe, To see the Devill so, prevailing here, To conjure up to ev'ry man a Foe Among those Friends that in his bosome were? Who thought to see so many brothers rage Against each other? Fathers, without griefe, To ruinate the Pillars of their age? So many sonnes, to seeke their fathers life? Who could have, then, beleeved this; that, friends, Familiars, neighbours, kinsmen, mothers, daughters, Should have, so madly, sought each others ends? And mention, without teares, their wounds &amp; slaughters? And, finde this hellish poyson, to be shed Almost in ev'ry village, house, and bed? Who did suspect, that men who dote on wealth, And make a God of Pleasure and of Ease? Esteeming highly, safetie, limbes, and health; Should madly foole away their part of these? And side, and quarrell so, about those things Which most of them, regarded not a whit? For, what their duties were to God, or Kings, Or Commonwealth, it troubled not their wit. Nor doth it now, if their discourse and life May shew what Conscience of such things they make: And, from this observation, I, with griefe, Infallibly, may this Conclusion take; That nothing else, this mischiefe did begin, But, universall ripenesse of our sin. How could there else, so soone, so many be So hardned in the cruelties of war? And, multitudes so forward as we see For Rob'ries, Rapes, and Murthers, as they are? Who did a while agoe suspect he had Acquaintance, neighbours, houshold servants too, So wicked, so malicious, and so bad, To put in act, what now we see them doe? War hath occasion given, to disclose What ev'ry man affects. And, ev'ry one, As opportunitie he gaineth, showes What things his heart is truly set upon. Oh! if Wars entrance with such guilt begins, Before it ends, how great will be our sins? Observe, aud credit this which now I say, (Though I perhaps not worth regard may seeme) Lest you repent it else another day, And, finde too late, my words were worth esteeme. If Peace we seeke not, and pursue it too, Before there be too great an obduration, Ere long, so hardned men in sin will grow, That on his neighbour, none will have compassion. But, ev'ry one, according to his powre, Shall only labour his owne Will to gaine; And shall corrupt each other, and devoure, Till wealth, nor wit, nor honestie remaine. Nor ought, but such a raskall Generation, As merits Gods, and good mens execration. How happie had we been, if we had fear'd Before these feares had ceaz'd us? and how blest? Had we with penitence those warnings heard Which notice gave, of this unwelcome ghest? But, now the Breach is made; the Floods break in, And, we with miseries, are overflowne. We shall be losers, though the day we win. When spoiles we take, the losse will be our owne. Because, from forraigne foes, we fear'd no harme, God, for our sins, hath rais'd us foes at home. Our selves, against our selves, we strongly arme; And slaught'rers, of each other, are become. An universall Ruine is begun; And, he that was most rich, is most undone. Behold, the Plough, by whom we are all fed, Is throwne into the ditch; Our Herds decay: Our Shepheards, and our Husbandmen, are fled: Artificers, may shut up shop, and play. The Labourer, must either starve, or fight; The Gownman, must a Swordman, learne to be; Nor Magistrate, nor Lawes, can doe us right; The Creditor, and Debtor, may agree. The Glutton, must be glad of homely fare; The Drunkard, must drink water, or be drie; Old lowsie rags, Pride, must be faine to weare; Our idle Dames, in vaine, for bread shall crie. And, they who late, in finest linnen lay, Shall scarce have leave, to lodge in straw, and hay. How are our goodly buildings overthrowne! How are our pleasant arbours hackt, and hew'd! How bare and rude, are those neat places growne, Where fruitfull Orchards, and faire Groves, we view'd! Through Walks and Fields, which I have visited With peacefull Mates, and free from fear of harmes; Yea, there, where oft Faire-Ladies I have led, I now lead on, a Troupe of men in Armes. In Meadowes, where our sports were wont to be, (And, where we playing wantonly have laine) Men sprawling in their blood, we now doe see; Grim postures, of the dying, and the slaine. And where sweet musique hath refresht the eare, Sad groanes of ghosts departing, now we heare. In ev'rie Field, in ev'rie Lane, and Street, In ev'rie House, (almost in ev'rie place) With Cries, and Teares, and Loud-complaints we meet; And, each one thinks his owne, the saddest case. But, what are private Losses, while we view Three famous Kingdomes, wofully expos'd To miserable Ruine, and so few, Lament that plague, wherewith we are inclos'd? My selfe, and my estate, I shall contemne, Till we, in freedome, sing our Syon-Songs; Till we have peace, in our Ierusalem; And Church, and State, have what to them belongs. For, what to these, are Oxen, Sheep, and Kine? Or, any losse, that is but your, or mine? But, how should we have Peace, or Consolation? Whence can it come? whilst, each of us neglects The meanes, of such a blessed expectation? And from bad Causes, looks for good effects? Who yet repents? who, all alone, bewailes His private sins? Or, since this Tempest rose, Hath taken downe, one furle of his proud sailes, That we the publike Vessell might not lose? Few of us, yet, have truly laid aside Our Self-conceit, our Envie, or our Spleene, Our Avarice, our Wilfulnesse, or Pride, And, doubtlesse, whilst among us, these are seene, In vaine, we hope, our miseries will cease; In vaine, we, look for Comfort, Truth, or Peace. Give me, Oh God! give me those moving teares, Those deep-set sighes, and those prevailing groanes, Which may have powre to pierce through all the Spheres, And fetch downe Pittie, for distressed ones. Give me enough for one, that would deplore The sins of three great Nations; and, lament For his owne share, a little world-full more, Which he too long deferred to repent. Give me those Teares that acceptable be; Such, as on Syons evill day were shed; Such, as in bottles are preserv'd by thee; Such, as were dropt, when Lazarus was dead: Such, as if Teares might so much virtue have, May three great Kingdomes, from destruction save. Help us to that Peace-Offring, whence, may fume Into thy nostrils, that sweet-smelling savour, Whereby, thy Majestie may re-assume These Kingdomes, once againe, into thy favour. With holy Charmes, thou hast delighted bin; For, when in mournfull Elegies, to thee The Son of Iesse did bewaile his sin, From all his guilt, thy grace did set him free. Why may not, then, to me, for whose example Thy Spirit hath his pietie recorded, (Having within my heart, thy Inner-Temple) Compos'd a Song, like mercie, be afforded? In hope it shall, to thee, O Gracious-God! My Spirit groaneth forth this mournfull Ode. Alas! how darkesome be! How gloomy, and how dim! Thy Privie-lodgings, LORD, in me, Which, Ioy was wont to trim? What Ghosts are they that haunt, The Chambers of my breast! And, when I sleep, or comfort want, Will give my heart no rest? Me thinks, the sound of grones, Are ever in mine eare: Deepe-graves, Deaths-heads, and Charnel-bones Before me, still appeare. And, when asleep I fall, In hope to find some ease, My dreames, to me, are worst of all, And fright me, more then these. Ah me! why was I borne So late? or why so soone? To see so bright, so cleare a Morne, So blacke an Afternoone? What in my youth I fear'd, What was long since foretold, And, oft with scornes, and sleightings heard, Fulfild, I now behold. The Queene of Europes Iles, The Princesse of her Lands, (Late happy, in thy loving smiles) Now, neare to ruine stands. For, by their Crying-sins, Prince, Peeres, and People too, Have brought their feet into those Gins, Which no man can undoe. Our Cunningst-wits have tride To help untwist the Snare; But, when they thought the cords would slide They more insnarled were: And, since it is not words, That can our Peace restore, We now betake us to our Swords, And make the mischiefe more. How great is our distresse! How grievous is our sin! That ev'ry thing doth more increase The Plague, that we are in! There is yet, LORD, in thee, A meanes of ease and aid, Whereby, we sav'd from that might be, Whereof, we are afraid. O God! thy helpe command; (For humane helpes are vaine) And, in compassion to this Land, Returne thou, once againe. And, if so much regard, May to my suit be showne, Let me behold this Tempest clear'd, Before my Sun goe downe. O Lord! returne with mercie to these Lands; Give not thy Glorie over to the Foe. Leave not thy Churches, in their bloodie hands, Who seek, in this, thy Kingdomes overthrow. Returne, before our Spoilers hand have laid On ev'rie pleasant, ev'rie pretious thing. Before the Lions on thy Lambs have preyd; Before they shall thy Flocks to ruine bring. Before our habitations doe appeare Like heaps of Rubbish, or the ploughed earth: Before our pleasant fields, and gardens, are Like Fornace-Fels; or, Highlands in the North. And, e're our Palaces, late neat and trim, Are made the walks, and haunts, of Zim, and Iim. Once more! once more, oh God! in mercie heare These miserable Iles, of whose neare fall, Their neighb'ring Foes in expectation are, And, to behold it; on each other call. Thy foes they are, oh Lord! as well as our; Oh! give not therefore, way to their despight. Let not their malice, nor our sins, have powre, Vpon our Tombes, to build up their delight. Though they Divide, permit them not to Raigne; But, let our Head, and Bodie, so accord, That we, the stronger, may be knit againe, And, in their bosome, sheath our angrie Sword: For, our blest reconcilement, further shall Thy Churches triumphs; and, their Babels, fall. Their date is neare, if I aright have hit, The meaning of that Number, which by thee Was left, to trie the strength of everie wit, Which longs the fall of Antichrist, to see. To Them, I turn my speech; and thus dare say, His Friends and Helpers are now moving on, The cunningst plot, that they have left to play; And, when that's past, their game will quite be done, Some SAINTS, their policie will so beguile, That, they to their Designe shall furth'rance bring: Yea, they shall help it forward, for a while, Who favour nor the Persons, nor the Thing. But lest your hearts may faile, through long delay, Give eare, and heed, what, now, my Muse will say. That yeare, in which ROMES long-liv'd Emperie, Shall from the day, wherein it was at height, Sum up, M, D, C, L, X, V, and I, In order, as these Letters here I write: That Yeare, that Day, that Houre, will be the date Of her continuance; preserving neither Top, Root, or Branch of that accursed State, Nor Head, nor Bodie, Limb, Horne, Claw, or Feather. For, here are all the Numerals of ROME In order, as they are in valuation; Which cannot make a lesse, or greater sum, Without Disorder, Want, or Iteration. Nor can she longer stand, or sooner fall, If I mistake not Him, who governes all. By Number, Weight, and Measure, worketh He, Allotting to each thing the Bound, and Season, Which may both correspond with his Decree, And, somewhat, also, suit, with Humane-Reason. In Ægypt, thus a certaine time of stay Was to the seed of Iacob, there assign'd; Thus likewise, to a fore-appointed day, The raigne of Baltashazar was confin'd. Thus, from the time of Daniels supplication, Till Christ should come, the time foretold appeares To be, a pre-ordained limitation, Vntill the date, of Seventie weekes of yeares. And, thus ROMES declination may, no doubt, Be numbring, till her NVMERALS are out. Two famous Numbers, are in them contain'd; The first, declares that length of time, wherein The Devill was, by Powre-Divine, restrain'd From setting up, the Mysterie of Sin. The later, is the Number of the Beast; Which, when the Let was taken quite away, (Whereby he was a thousand yeares supprest) Doth number out his Kingdome, to a day. It is the number of the Name, or Powre, Ev'n of a Man (of that mysterious-Man) By whom Sin-mysticall is to this houre, Continu'd; and, by whom, it first began. And, he that can begin the thousandth yeare, Shall finde the Number of the Beast, is neare. To search out that, it seemes not hard to me, Since I beleeve, that when of her chiefe sin ROME to be guiltie, did first prove to be, Her Declinations did then first begin. And, sure, of all her sins, the greatest Crime Was crucifying of the Lord of life; And, in unjustly persecuting them, Who tendred Saving-Truth, to their beleefe. Then, therefore, I presume ROMES fall begun, And that GOD, measur'd, weigh'd, and numbred hath How many backward Rounds, her wheele should run, When she had gain'd her glorioust height on earth: So, in those NVMERALS, which are her owne, (And all she hath) her Fate was written downe. To bring this work to passe, there is a Let To be remov'd, of no meane consequence: The op'ning of it cannot, well, as yet Be borne, among us, without much offence; And, warrant I have none to make my heart So bold, as to disclose it: neither may it With wisedome be revealed, till that Part Be furnished with Actors, fit to play it. And, of this Mystery, perhaps, the Key Must be delivered by some Abler-one, Who shall have powre to doe, as well as say, What, God, hath fore-appointed shall be done. They first must take the Works, without the Walls, And then, the great Malignant-Citie falls. Then, with exceeding infamie, and scornes, The BEAST, which yet so dreadfull seemes to some, Shall lose his Heads, and moult away his Hornes, And, to the world, a laughing stock become. Then, many things, that have been long conceal'd (And which, to blinde the carnall Readers eie, In seven darke Mysteries, were closely seal'd) To ev'ry faithfull soule shall open lie. That Kingdome, which the Iew did long agoe Mould out, according to his erring braine, And whereof, many zealous Christians too, Vnwarrantable fancies, dreame, or faine, That Kingdome, whereof, yet, but types we heare, Shall to the world, essentially appeare. Be patient, therefore, you that are opprest; This Generation shall not passe away, Till some, behold the downfall of that Beast, Which, yet, among us, with his Taile doth play. Then, will the Lambe of God begin to take The Kingdome to himselfe: And, ev'rie King That on his rights, doth usurpations make, To judgement, and to ruine, he shall bring. No Kingling, then, assume the boldnesse shall, Blasphemously (for know it is no lesse) To stile himselfe The King-Catholicall, As if Earths universall Globe were his: For, though another hath usurp'd thereon, That Title, doth belong to Christ, alone. And, tis no marvaile if the Potentates, And Princes of this world, shall now combine, By policie, to strengthen their estates; And, with the Beast, and Gog, and Magog, joine: No marvaile, if enraged they appeare, Through jealousies and doubts, of losing that, By which, their pride and lusts, maintained were, And, which, base Feare, and Flatt'rie first begat: For, all those Kingdomes, and those Emperies, Throughout the world, which their beginning took, By humane wit, fraud, force, or tyrannies, Shall passe away, and vanish into smoake. An Armie, whereof yet there's little hope, Shall wrest the Scepter both from Turke, and Pope. Religion, and meere showes of Pietie, Have beene so long the masks for base designes: The great Vice-gerents of the Deity, Have made such Polititians of Divines; And these together have so fool'd and cheated The consciences of people well inclin'd, That, of all Freedomes we are nigh defeated, Belonging to the Body and the Mind. Yea, GOD they so have mock'd; and on his Throne And his Prerogative, so farre incroach'd, That, of his honour he is jealous grown, And, will no longer, be by them reproach'd: But, to the Saints, their liberties restore, And, give those Kings their Portions with the Whore. D'ye startle at it? as if I had spoke High-Treason? or, as if what now I say, Without a Warrant, I had undertooke To certifie? Perhaps, you think, I may. Know, therefore, that, I had this information Not from a private Spirit; but, from his Known and unquestionable Revelation, Which, to the world, long since, revealed this. Those Kings, which, to the Lamb their crowns resigne, And shall (the Beast opposing) be content To raigne, according to the Discipline Which Christ commands, shall keep their Government: The rest shall weep, and waile, and curse their birth, With wicked Kings, and Merchants of the earth. Christ, and his Law, shall then beare all the sway, By Governments, resembling that, perchance, For which the Iewes Gods Yoke did cast away, The King-ship, of the Gentiles, to advance. And, as Gods people, foolishly did crave Instead of his mild Scepter, to obtaine That Heathnish-Monarchy, which doth inslave And seek, by Arbitrary-Powre, to raigne: So, shall all people, then, desire to leave Their Ethnick-Chaines, and, with his holy-Nation, Christ's precepts, and his discipline receive, And, be partakers too of their Salvation. And, when this glorious Kingdome shall begin, The Fulnesse of the Gentiles, enters in. God, hath so long deferred the possession Of that great Blisse; because, our worldlinesse, Hypocrisie, and discord, keepes the Blessing, From ripening into such a Happinesse. Some, in unrighteousnesse, the Truth retaine, And, make the same thereby, the lesse beleev'd. Some, by an Outward-holinesse doe gaine The meanes to have their Heresies receiv'd. While some pursue the Antichrist, without them, An Antichrist, ariseth up within them; Which, if they look not warily about them, New work for Reformation, will begin them: But, God will finish what he pre-ordain'd, When Penitence, and Sin, their heights have gain'd. Oh! that I could expresse what glorious sights, My soule hath glimpses of, by contemplation, And to what brave and unbeleeved heights, They screw me, by an unperceiv'd gradation! That blessed Kingdome, which, by faith I see, And know shall come; me thinks, doth now appeare Described by a Patterne unto me, As if it painted, in dim Landskip, were: And, my unbounded soule, runs rambling over So many objects, that, if she should give Account, of ev'ry thing she can discover, I should relate, what few would yet beleeve; And give to fooles occasion, one time more, To scoffe me; as they have done, heretofore. Whilst thus I muz'd, behold, the foe came on And to possesse the bord'ring hils began; My Colonell, experienc'd Midleton, A valiant Scot, that day led up the Van. A Troupe that flankt him on the left I led: The word was ordred forth; the souldier shouted. Our martiall musick them incouraged, And, each from other, fears of danger flouted. Our forces joyn'd in clouds of fierie smoke; Whence many whizzing thunder-bolts were shot: Our glittring swords, like flashing lightning, stroke Each others eyes, and bloudy showres begot; Enough, whereby our courage might be tride; And, yet, with no great losse, on either side. For, lest, while of (each part) the Forlorne-hopes Together strove, our Side might seek to take A narrow-passe (which might have made some stops, To their great hazzard, in retreating back) They wheel'd about, as if to gain some ground Of more advantage: so, before the place We rightly knew, or their intention found, Instead of a Re-charge, we gave them chase: Which being finish'd, and my warmed blood Grown colder, by our Adversaries flight, Another Foe, which long my peace withstood, A Challenge brought me, for another Fight: And, in the dark, when that dayes march was done, A second furious battell we begun. A strong Brigade, was mustred up together, And many cunning Engines forth were brought, Which, doubtlesse, had I come unarmed thither, Had gained him the Victory, he sought. To undermine me, he, at first, perplext My heart, with many deep and subtill questions: To win that Fortresse, he assayed, next, By strong perswasions, and untrue suggestions. Then, with confused throngs of dangers, feares, And, other such like Instruments as those, By violence, to storme it, he prepares; And, force prevailing not, his craft he showes: Which, taking like effect, he beat the Drum, And to a Parlee we began to come. His Generall was that Deluding-Reason, Which hath so much befool'd this Generation, Defaming Loyaltie with termes of treason, And seeking Truths, and true mens defamation. This is that Grand-Impostresse, which hath had The powre of late, our Clergie to misguide, To blinde the King, to make the Nobles mad, And lead the Common-people quite aside. This is the Mountebanck that cheats the Land, With Romish-Drugs, and fills our heads with toyes That buildeth Forts, and Churches in the Sand, And faire and firme foundations, oft, destroyes. And this is she that men so blinde doth make, The shadow, for the substance, to mistake. She thus began: Within thy Soveraignes Land How darest thou, bold Traitor, to appeare Without his Approbation or Command With that thy Troope of armed Rebels, there? Hast thou not heard those Royall Proclamations, Which threaten those who thus themselves aray? Hast thou not read those learned Declarations, That shew thee how thy Leaders goe astray? Hast thou not heard the rev'rend Prelates preach, That, all the Kings Commands must be obey'd? Hast thou not heard approved Doctors teach, That, all we have must at their feet be laid? And, that a Mortall cloath'd with Majestie, Is little lower then the Deitie? Thy service and obedience to the King, Even God himselfe injoynes: why dost thou then Assistance to his Adversaries bring, And, rather disobey thy GOD, then men? Nay, thou thy selfe hast that Allegiance taught, Which now thou violat'st, and couldst foretell What mischieves would upon their heads be brought, Who should against their Soveraigne-Prince rebell. Yet now, behold, thou neither having awe Of thine owne Conscience, or the royall right Of GOD'S commands, or of the Kingdomes Law, Dost arme thy selfe against all these to fight. And by pretences for the publike good, Defil'st the Kingdome, and thy selfe with blood. An Arbitrary-government you blame, And to the Lawes, your Actions seeme to tie, Yet by your Ordinances, doe the same Which to the King, unjustly you deny. You for the Subjects libertie contend, Yet into Prisons, freemen you have throwne. To ease them of Taxations, you pretend; Yet make them greater then were ever knowne. You take from whom you please, and what you list; And no man is assured of his owne, Or dares to contadict, much lesse resist. Yea, lately, you so insolent are growne, That, not the People onely you undoe, But, many wayes, abuse your Soveraigne too. To make him rich, faire promises you made; But, so far off have been from adding more, That you have taken from him what he had, And, rendred him lesse able then before. To cherish Virtue, or to punish Vice, Or to protect the wrong'd, or to relieve The needie soule; you neither offices, Nor Armes, nor Rents, to his disposure give. Gods glorie, and Religious puritie, Sincerely to affect, you make a show; But, thereof, we have small securitie, Whilst pious Monuments you overthrow. And, whilst, you favour, cherish, and protect The Schismaticks of every Giddy-Sect. The King denieth nothing he may grant; But voweth and protesteth, to maintaine, The true Religion of the Protestant; And, lets the Subjects dues, to them remaine. Of him you foster Causlesse Iealousies; For, to the People, or the Parliament He hath intended no such Injuries, As your seducers causlesly invent. He aymeth at the reall preservation Of Rights, Lawes, Customes, and of all that's due To Church, or Common-weale; for which this Nation A publike, or just private claime, can shew; And, that which to preserve he doth assay, You, Rebels, seeke to change, or take away. He stands oblig'd the Kingdome to protect; But, you his Townes, Armes, Forts, and Ships doe ceaze; Whereby his Office wants a prime effect: And, you against him arme your selves with these. The People you seduce; and you invent Devices, cunningly, to drive away The Lords, and Commons from the Parliament, That your owne pleasures, there, enact you may. The Kings best friends for traitors you pursue: By Sequestrations, you have made them poore: Nay he himselfe misjudged is of you, At least, a fav'rer of the Scarlet-Whoore. And, he that was to be your Glorie borne, Is now become an object of your scorne. How can you therefore safely live or die In such a Cause? How can you, without feare, Be actors in that bloody Tragædie, Whereto, thus blindly, you advancing are? How will you to your GOD? how, to your King? How, to this wronged Kingdome, answer make? When by their powr they shall that Vengeance bring, Which will be due, for what you undertake? Thus far she rav'd; and, further, as I think She had proceeded: But, I having ey'd My Troopers (and perceiving some, to shrinke At her last words) I rein'd my horse aside To cheere my Troope; then, wheel'd a little back, And, to confute those falshoods, thus I spake. Trait'resse to Reason, that high heav'n-born-Queen, Whom ev'ry earthly Monarch should obey; Thou who the Cause of all those Plagues hast beene Which overflow this Iland, at this day: How long wilt thou persist, with showes of truth To colour falshood? and, from thy delusions, Draw forth (to cozen heedlesse age and youth) Inconsequents, and frivolous conclusions? In vaine thou seek'st with words to terrifie From what, with good advisement, is begun. With honour, we have hope to live, and dye, What ever can by thee be said, or done, And, in our just resolves will settle fast, In spight of all the Sophistrie thou hast. Imprudent Amazon, why com'st thou arm'd With Potguns, and with Kexes to invade, A Skonce that's triple fortifi'd, and charm'd, By Spels, which to secure it, Reason made? Beleevest thou, Lies, Fallacies and Showes Chew'd into paper pellets, can affright Ought else but Regiments of Dawes and Crows, Or things that come to feed, but not to fight? When to my face thou falfly dar'st accuse My Conscience, which none knowes but God and I, And wouldst my owne beleefe thereof abuse, Behinde my back, how wilt thou me belye? My Writings too, in favour of thy Cause, Thou understandest, as thou dost the Lawes. Their Author is in being, so am I; The Lawes true sense is that which they shall give; And, I am he that best can testifie The meaning of my Poems, whilst I live. I have not swerv'd essentially from ought (If well my words, and deeds be understood) Which I have either counselled or taught, Pertaining to the King or Common-good. And though thy friends report that I rebell, And, Balam-like, against my knowledge too, (When I had both foretold, and counsel'd well What would befall, and what men ought to doe) I shall occasions finde, my selfe to cleare Of all, whereof I guilty may appeare. The factions of our Clergie I foresaw, The progresse of their factions I foretold, Which way the one our Soveraignes heart should draw, VVhich way the other, tempt the people should; And, thereupon my soule (as well it might) Fearing such mischiefes as from thence doe spring, According to the measure of her light, Did counsell both the People and the King. The King proceeded as his Prophets taught, (For their despight made void my good intent) The other faction of the Clergie sought To worke upon the peoples discontent: And had not then a miracle been done, It had, long since, Rebellion here begun. For, had not God beyond all hopes of our, VVhen plotted mischiefs were to ripenesse come, Vouchsafed us a Parliamentall powre, The sin, which I most fear'd, to keep us from: My wit perceives not how the peoples rage (Provoked so, as then it would have bin) Should meanes have found that furie to asswage, VVhich would have brought a true Rebellion in. Nay, to such heights was discontentment rais'd, That, if this present timely Parliament (Which never can sufficiently be prais'd) Had not enabled beene, as well as sent By God himselfe, a wondrous worke to doe; They had, e're long, beene flaves, and rebels too. But, having by meere Providence procur'd The Priviledge for their continuation, To be by an Enacted-Law secur'd, Till they saw cause to give it limitation; Such courage thereby took they, and such hope, Their good endeavours should not be undone. As heretofore (through want of time and scope To perfect things which they had well begun) That, they have qualifi'd the fierie zeale, Which might have kindled a rebellious flame; And armed lawfully this Common-weale, To make a just defence, as her became: For, tis her safetie, that secures the King; And her destruction will his ruine bring. We are not come, our Soveraigne to oppose, But, for him, we thus armed now appeare, By Warrant, and Authoritie from those, Who, to confer it, well enabled were: Ev'n by that Supreme-Counsell, whence doe come All acts that most concerne the Publike-weale; The sacred Senate, from whose finall doome We cannot to another Judge appeale. When that commands, the Kings commands they be, More binding, then his personall Injunction. In their contempt, dishonoured is he, And disobeyed in his noblest function. In his, we but his Person disobey; In their, his Powre, and Office we gainsay. We heare indeed, sometime, a Proclamation Injoyning that, or else forbidding this: But how, I pray, shall we have information, Whose will and pleasure, and whose deed it is? The Person of the King we seldome see; His Court is now a place uncertaine growne: With him, no lawfull Counsellors hath he; How then, of us, can his true minde be knowne? Since in his Name, anothers Will may come, We neither knowing whence, nor yet from whom? The Court of Parliament appeares to all, To have therein, the Royall Powre, and Name: It keeps the Place, whereto the King did call, And virtually abideth still the same. That Order, Ordinance, and that Commission, Which issues forth from them, to us appeares To be their act and deed, without suspition: And we obey it as the Kings and theirs: Why, therefore, should we be reproach'd, and blam'd, Because, we are not rather guided by A printed sheet, wherein the King is nam'd, To draw us our knowne dutie to deny? By telling us, a trait'rous part we play, Vnlesse, our King and Countrie, we betray? Me thinks, it were a motive somewhat odd, That those few lines, which ill-advice might draw, Beginning thus, Charles by the grace of God, Should more oblige, then equitie and Law. Yet, this is our condition; and, unlesse We will suspect our eie-sight, and our hearing; And say we are in state of happinesse, When universall ruine we are fearing; Or else beleeve (or say and sweare we doe, Though false it be) what ere our foes perswade; And will be Infidels, and Asses too, Or such tame Fooles, as they of some have made, We must be censur'd in our noblest action, To have unjust designes, and side with faction. Vnlesse with Rehoboams Cavalleers, We will bring aid and counsell to oppresse: Vnlesse we will not think that all our Fears Are without reall ground, and reasonlesse: Vnlesse we will beleeve Achitophel, The Parasites of Ioash, Iudahs-King; The Priests of Ahab, Baal, and Iezabel, Which to Idolatrie this Land would bring; Vnlesse our selves meere slaves we will repute, Vnlesse we will against all right and Reason, Gods Epithetes, to Princes attribute, Or, falsly say, our Loyalty is Treason, Or, do, as Fools and Traitors have appointed, We fight (forsooth) against the Lords annointed. Yea, then it must be told me, I rebell; That, I resist my Soveraigne and the Lawes; That Balaam-like the truth I could fore-tell, And know the right, yet aid an evill cause. But, what am I? Thou sayst, the Parliament (Though showes of other purposes it carry) In practice doth approve that Government, Which, in the King, they say, is Arbitrary; Which is untrue. For, Arbitrary Sway Is that which governs by the Will of One; But, when their Ordinances we obey, To Reason we submit, agreed upon By many, chosen out to that intent, Both by our own, and by the Kings consent. What ever then that Counsell shall ordaine, Is in effect the Pleasure of the King, And our united; whereof to complain, It were a causlesse and a foolish thing. And, though we may have grievances thereby, We cannot call them injuries, by reason 'Twas to prevent a lasting misery, By making us to suffer for a season. The Parliament abridgeth no mans right, Takes no mans Liberty, or goods away: To favour some, and others to despight: Or, that themselves therewith inrich they may; But, seize it for the Publike; and from those, Who, to the publike harme, thereof dispose. Perhaps, unruly souldiers, and some too Who them command, will practise, now and then, Harsh violence, as Devils use to do, Who, at these times, come forth in shape of men. But, from such insolencies I am free And ev'ry way so clear; that though our Foes Of To the value of above 2000. l. all I had have quite despoiled me: And, though I was authorized by those Who pow'r might give, my losses to redresse On them who robbed me; I have not sought Without compassion, or with greedinesse, To mend my Fortunes, as, I heare, 'tis thought: But, only taken, what the present need Requir'd; my self, and Family to Feed. Yea, save when we from home had marched farre, And thither, where, perforce, we did indure The hard and strong necessities of warre, Through want of means, things needfull to procure: We nothing took without a recompence, Nor (to my knowledge) either then, or there, But, with good words, and, without violence; And, nought but what did need, and they might spare. Nor did I, or, my Troupers, leave unpaid Our Quarters any where, whilst we had pay. And, since our entertainments were delaid, They have my word for paiment, when I may. And, by thus taking, Souldiers grieve men lesse In times of War, then Courtiers did in Peace, We take not, as Monopolizers do, And, begger Many, to inrich but One: Nor take we from, both poor, and wealthy, too, As Tyrants, that our pleasure might be done, Nor as the damn'd-selfe-damming Cavalleer, Who for his lust, and for the Kingdomes harme, From good and bad, from friend and foe doth teare, What ever may be reached with his arme. The Parliament (a Body representing The Kingdome) takes from none; but of her owne Takes part, for furtherance, or for preventing Of good or evill, either fear'd or knowne. And if this be unjust, or lawlesse taking, It is not by a Law of Reasons making. For, as the Bodie-naturall may take From hands or feet, or any other part, To wrap about the head, when it shall ake; Or, warme to keep the stomack, or the heart, When life is else in danger: right so, may The Body-politike, without reproofe, From any of her Members, take away, For it owne preservation, or behoofe. Yea, doubtlesse, if a man his goods may spend, His body to redeeme; or give consent Some Blood to lose, or Member, to this end, That he the losse of life might so prevent; Much more may that Great-Bodie doe the same, Without the brand of injurie, or blame. The taxes, which our Parliament impose, Are not to grieve the people; but, to aid And strengthen them against the powre of those, By whom uneasie burthens have been laid. If they be greater now, then heretofore, It is because necessities are greater; And, now require, we should bestow the more, To make hereafter, our assurance better. And, pitty were it, but he should be father To none but slaves; or, to a generation Who should not dare, old rotten rags to gather Without a Patent, and a Proclamation, Who for his Country, thinks his goods too much; Or, would his life in this adventure grutch. As for their loyall offers to the King, They ready were; and are as ready, still, Their wealth, and powre, and all they have to bring To serve him, if his part he shall fulfill. They would be loth his treasure to increase, To purchase instruments, wherewith to slay them. Or, raise an Armie, to disturb their peace; Or, to corrupt their Captaines, to betray them; They should be loth to give him Rents and Lands, Buffoones, and men unworthy to advance; That they might weaken us, and arme his hands, To make us Subjects A la mod' de FRANCE. But, for his Guard, and for the publike-peace, Our Goods, our Lives, and all we have is his. If his Revennues, in their hands they stay, It is not without reason (as is thought) But, to secure his Crowne, and to defray The charge of War, which he on us hath brought. If they, from his disposure, now withdraw Some things, by Him, dispos'd of heretofore, It is because their right it is by Law; And, ought to be neglected so no more. When things permitted out of good respects, Are challenged as customary rights; And, when good meanings bring forth ill effects, Tis time to take more heed of oversights; And, that, by having erred heretofore, We may not be undone for evermore. Ships, Forts, and Armes belong unto the Prince, Not for himselfe, but for the publike use: They therefore keeping them for his defence, (And for the Kingdomes good) what needs excuse? Or, if they ceazed on them, with intent To prepossesse them, that they might, in time, Their foes inhumane purposes prevent; It was no fault, or, else, a veniall Crime. They made their Ordinances not for Lawes, But, for the present need, to be in force; Lest Law-proceedings being at a pause, The mischiefs (over-great) grow daily worse, And, none denies the Parliament, this powre But, they who seek their freedomes to devoure. Though Libellous Detractors, and that Rabble, Whom thy deluding Sophistries deceive, Pretend their purpose is dishonourable, And, of his dues, our Soveraigne to bereave; Your sland'rous Allegations are untrue, And rais'd by those who hate the Parliament; Because, a Reformation they pursue; And that, which may their purposes prevent. Far is it, either from their thought, or our The King, of his just profits to defeat; Or to deprive him of that Kingly powre Whose want may make his honour incompleat. By taking, or by clipping (to his wrong) Those Rights, which to his Office doe belong, When ought they take, it is to take away That mischiefe, which may take him from his Throne. When they deny, it is not to gainsay, But, that his lawfull pleasure may be done. When they disarme him, tis but that his foes Might not with his owne weapons him destroy. When they his Rents withhold, it is that those Should not his wealth to his owne losse employ. Have they restrain'd his powre? they did it not To limit him; but, that his Parasites, Should not to his dishonour, him beset; And, make that Pander to their appetites, Till by their wicked practices, first, we Are to their wills inslaved; and, then He The worst condition they would bring him to, Is onely this; that, if he or his Son, By ill advisement, would themselves undoe, No innocent should thereby be undone. Nor they, if during life, Manasseh-like, They could repent. This brave Prerogative, This Priviledge, for him, and his, we seeke; That, nothing of his Throne might him deprive. We labour, that it gloriously might stand, By Righteousnesse upheld: and, that his Line May beare the Royall-Scepter in this Land, As long as either Sun, or Moone shall shine, By being made, true Homagers to Him, That weares the universall Diadem. They would not have him, or his childe, hereafter, Suppose that an advantage can be had, By bringing to his bed King Pharaohs daughter; Or, any with whom, God, the Banes forbad. VVe would not have him, Rehoboam-like, Advance his Throne by tyrannous oppression: Or (led by foolish Counsell) Shadowes seeke Till he had lost the Substance in possession. They would not have him set up golden-Calves, VVith Ieroboam; and suppose to save By policie, and serving God, by halves, That Kingdome, which to him, he freely gave, Till he, like him, hath made the people sin, And, brought our Endlesse-desolation in. They would not have him, Ahab-like, misled By wicked female Counsels; or, by those Dissembling Priests and Prophets, who have bred That Plague, which now this Iland, overgrowes. Nor would they that (with King Iehosaphat) Some fruitlesse complements, or causlesse feares, Should draw him, to become confederate, VVith such as are profest Idolaters: But, that like David, he should purge his Court From impudent offenders; and from all Those practices, which are of ill report; And chiefly those, which will for vengeance, call: That so his Kingdome might be safe in God, From traytors here at home, and foes abroad. They would not have his Minions rob his Name Of all that honour which thereto belongs; And, in requitall, make him beare the blame Of their loud-crying cruelties, and wrongs. They would not have each honourable Place, Fild up, in stead of Princes, with such groomes, As to this Kingdomes, and our Kings disgrace, Late fild, and yet defile those noble Roomes. Fellowes, of whom the publike fame records No merit; unlesse merit be in roring, In being trusty Panders to their Lords; In gaming, drinking, quarrelling, or whoring. For, by these virtues, from a trencher-man, A Princes Minion, riseth, now and than. They would not at the sacred Counsell-Board, That, Lust, and Pride, and Avarice should sit Arrayed, and intitled like a Lord, That hath nor credit, honesty, nor wit. Or, such a Ruffian, as (when suiters, there, In humble wise their greevances prefer) Shall sweare, God damne me, I will nothing heare, That is inform'd against an Officer. Or such, as with notorious impudence, Shall taunt imperiously, or tartly blame A man, that is of well knowne innocence, When they themselves doe merit publike shame; Because in publike view, and without awe, They violate divine, and humane Law. We would preserve our Soveraignes honourable: Not by a blast of ayrie Attributes; Much lesse by those that are unwarrantable, And, such as flatterie, alone, imputes. We wish he may be great, but not (with some) So great, as from a lawfull King, to swell Into a Tyrant; and, by that meanes come To gaine a Principalitie in Hell. We wish him rich; but, not by tricks, that may Inrich Projectors more: and, lastly prove A cheat, procuring him, another way, A greater dammage in his peoples love: But, of these things, we wish him so possest, That, they make him happy, and us blest. The Parliament, would so our Kings enable, If they, by their advisement, would proceed, As that, hereafter, no dishonourable, Vnsafe, or unfit courses, they should need. We blush (and are asham'd, as well as greev'd) That they of whom, we, Justice should obtaine, (When injuries from others we receive,) Give cause of greater sufferings to complaine. We thinke, what ere seducing Prelates say, They should have consciences as well as we: And, may have soules, which will, another day, Made subject to the Common Judgement be. And, we would have them none of those, that shall Crie to the Mountaines, downe on them to fall. We would not have them, to our daily sorrow, And their dishonor, wrong'd by such, as they, Who keep them still so needie as to borrow: And, never in condition to repay. We would not have them live, and die in debt, (As usually they doe) without regard, Whose wants, and whose complainings they forget: And whose deserts they leave without reward: Or, need to be incumbred with so many Oppressing Officers (who from us teare A shilling for themselves, for him, a penny; Yet, Raven-like, still, hungry Carions are) If their estates were setled once aright, And, managed by men that are upright. Then, should our Princes never need to send Their Privy-Seals, to borrow for their use; And, when they came where nothing was to lend, Be much displeased at a just excuse. Nor should they need to seek, as oft they do, By petty loanes, a generall supply; And (which ill suits with borrowing) threaten too, If we their expectation shall deny: Nor take such other courses, as of late Have been devis'd; and, which are baser, farre, Then our Collections at the Church-yard-gate; Yea, baser then our Countrey Help-Ales are: And, which a generous mind would scarce admit, Whilst he had rags to wear, or pulse to eat. For, who can mention, without Indignation, Those Rascall Projects, wherewith some pretended His Majesties Revenues augmentation; As when, with Sope, and Pins, they him befriended; Or, when they raised Fines, by Proclamation, From Labourers, and Beggers Cottages; Or, from their new-invented-Corporation, Salt, Mault, and Coals, with such like things as these: Or, if I erre not, some, from baser things, To raise the Kings Revenue, made a show, Ev'n from old Rags, from Guts for Fiddle-strings: And, if these Projects had not been enow, I think, ere this, there had been some device, To raise a profit out of Nits and Lice. We scorne, this Kingdome, or our King should be Dishonour'd by such beggarly inventions: To make him rich, a nobler way have we, When he shall please to like of our intentions. And, whatsoere thy sland'rous tongue hath said, Wee, seek our Soveeraignes welfare; and, with him No guilefull, or disloyall Parts have plaid, To wrong the Scepter, or the Diadem. Nor have we raced any Monument Of Christian-Piety; the Crosse except, That we might those Idolatries prevent, Which in, among us, by that Relique crept. And, down (for ought I know) the Crosse was took, As justly, as the brazen Snake was broke. For, though, when Christianity began, And Iewes, and Gentiles, mentioned with scorn, Christ-crucifi'd, unto the Christian-man, That badge was then with approbation worn, Because, it witnes'd them, no whit asham'd Of Him, in whom they did professe belief, Though doom'd he was, unto a death defam'd, And suffer'd as a murtherer, or theef: Yet, since the Popelings have a trick devis'd, To lift it up, above the civill use, And, for a Saint, the same hath canoniz'd, And, stain'd it, by idolatrous abuse. We have rejected it, as, now, become A wanton Token from the whore of Rome. That Sects, or Schismes, we favour, I deny; For, Law, and true Religion we befriend, Against their fury and Idolatry, Whom you have arm'd, injustice to defend. We to be regulated are content, (Not, by the fancies of one private braine, Or, by a few, that came ere they were sent) By those, to whom such matters appertaine. Some Lawyers have the sense of Law estrang'd From what it was: some, Priests, and Prelates too, Both Doctrines and Church-Discipline have chang'd, From that, which was establish'd long agoe; That, therefore, we might in the truth abide, VVe by the Fountaines would have all things tride. Though of her Members, faulty some appeare, The Parliaments maine purpose is upright: And, while preserved their Foundations are, The Righteous cannot lose their labours quite. Although the Kings intentions may be good, (As I still hope they be) yet, most of those That give him counsell, now, are men of blood; And, such as dutie bindes us to oppose. Twere no discretion to commit my Sword To him, who straight would give it to my foe: Nor were it wisely done to take his word, VVho knowes not, what he shall have powre to doe. For, oft, from Reason, other men estrange us; And, otherwhile, our owne corruptions change us. Thou saist, the King hath vowed, and protests, Our Lawes, and our Religion to defend. VVe ask no more, unlesse, as in the breasts Of private men they are, he shall intend: Or, shall conceive that he the Law doth carie VVithin himselfe: For, that doth plainly show The government he seeks, is Arbitrarie; VVhich, humbly we denie to be his due. I say the Law now armes me. He sayes no; And, calls me traitor, for what I have done. The Parliament affirmes I faile to doe My duty, if another course I run: And how the King in Law more skil'd can grow Then they that made it, I would gladly know. It were a fancie, to affirme he gained A knowledge of our Lawes by Revelation, Or that he studied them: then, he obtained His notions of them, by meere information, And who are his informers, now, but those, That, are the chiefe transgressors of the Law? They, who essentially the same oppose? Who, from it, their obedience quite withdraw? They, whose delinquencie hath made them feare? To let the Lawes true powre, or sense be knowne? Because, if their true vigour should appeare, These, and their Structures, would be overthrowne. Yea, they from whom, he learn'd his chiefest skill, Are they, who tell him, Law is, What he will. If thou shalt say, his Informations are From those, that in our Lawes most skilfull be, And, men unblam'd; admitting, such they were, (Though that is nor beleev'd, nor knowne of me) This, I am certaine of, my undertaking Was, by no such meane counsell undergone; Nor by a warrant of that private making, But, by a stronger; by a publike-one. Ev'n by that Senate, whence our Law doth spring; By that great Court, which is, by all, confest Chiefe-Counsell, to the Kingdome, and the King; The Lady and Commandresse of the rest; By those, from whom the Laws that binde this nation, Receive both being, and interpretation. Should I the judgement of that Court despise For their, whom yet, I neither heard, nor saw? Because a few, did other waies advise, More blam'd for arrogance, then fam'd for Law? And, is it not of dangerous consequence, That, to his rev'rend Parliaments disgrace, The King, in doubtfull points, should leave their sense For judgements, which from private spirits passe? For, if a private judgement vouch'd may be Against that Court, for Him; why may it not Against Him, be as well avouch'd for me, If to contend, I powre enough had got? Grant this, and every man as well may hope To damne a Generall-Councell, as the Pope. Grant this, and none can doubt the Kings intent The Protestant-Religion to maintaine, And all the Freedomes of the Parliament; For, they are in his Bosome, and his Braine. And what he will, yea, sometime, what his Groome Shall make him to beleeve, or understand, (Though all his dictates he receiv'd from Rome) Is then, the Law and Gospel of the Land. Most Prelates, and most Iudges were the Creatures Of Princes, and their Minions; therefore, these Make for them (as their Vassals, and their Debters) Religion, and the Lawes, ev'n what they please. And, hence our strifes, and all divisions spring, Twixt God, and us, the People, and the King. We would not bar our Sov'raignes, any powre Which fortifies, or dignifies the Crowne: Nor lose one lawfull Priviledge that's our, When we are well inform'd what is our owne. The People, did first make both Lawes and Kings: And, for their owne securitie, did make them. Then, he that shall repute them, to be things Ordain'd for other ends, doth much mistake them. Now, for themselves, if Lawes and Kings they made, The makers had beene madmen, to intend They should a meaning, or a Powre, have had To make them uselesse to their chiefest End, And give Prerogatives, or meanings to them, That, should, in stead of saving, helpe undoe them. True Reason, therefore, warrants me to say, That, when we to the Law a sense doe give, Which taketh any publike right away; Or stretcheth so the Kings Prerogative, As that the Kingdome is opprest thereby, Or, of the publike safety brought in feare; Or, doubtfull of approaching tyranny; Or liable to mischiefes may appeare; That sense of Law is false; usurped be All such Prerogatives: And, nor by time, Or frequent presidents, oblig'd are we To let our Freedomes, be infring'd by them: But, we should claime, and take, what proveth our, As oft, as GOD shall give us means and Powre. Though some Historians, and the flatt'ring Pen Have sti'ld the Norman, CONQVEROR; nor he, Nor any one before him, or since then, Can say, that we a conquer'd Nation be. For, by a Composition, and on Termes Becoming Free-men, we remain'd possest Of Liberty; and William threw down Armes, Accepting of that share we valued least. And, had we not as well by Oath, as Word, Beene reinvested in our Native-right, That which we lost unjustly, by the Sword, At all times, by the Sword, attempt we might To re-possesse, when GOD makes warrantable, That enterprize, by making of us able. For, this, I partly fight: not with the King; But, with those Miscreants who seek our harme: And, his abused Name, and Person, bring Vnwarie people, by faire showes, to charme. And, ere they shall accomplish their intent By slaving Him, their projects to befriend; Or by dishon'ring of the Parliament; My life time, in this Quarrell, I will spend. Or, if I must unhappily survive To see our English-Honour overthrowne, I will not (if I may avoid it) live To be a slave where I did freedome owne. Nor willingly, in any Land remaine, In which a Tyrant (call'd a King) shall raigne. This Quarrell, above thirty yeares before The Sword was drawne, I fought in, with my Pen, Till I by Tyrannie was made so poore, As that I thought, I ne're should rise agen. Without an Armie, or a Parliament To side withall; without one able friend; Without reward; without encouragement, To further that which I did well intend: Nay, strugling through much envie, and despight, That Warfare I continue to this houre: And, in this warfare, am resolv'd to fight, Whilst I to hold a Sword or Pen, have powre, Till I have compast, what, in hope, I have; Or, brought my tired Body to the Grave. For, peradventure, we are growne so bad, So false to God, so false in ev'rie thing, Both to our selves, and others; and have had So many Mercies, whence, no fruits doe spring, That, God will give this present Generation, To be what most deserve, and some desire; Ev'n to be slaves to that Abomination, With which their lives are doomed to expire. If so; then am I called thus to fight, But, onely, that my dutie might be done; And in this manner, have beene mov'd to write, That, for our sin, excuse we may have none, And God's great worke, which he will bring about, Shall be delayd, till this vile Race be out. Then shall the age to come, pick up, and gather Those droppings of my Pen, which now they scorne; And, wonder, men esteemed them no rather; And pittie those afflictions I have borne. Then, they shall scan each page, and ev'rie Line, And, finde rak'd up, among my Vanities, Expressions, which will show, that Sparks divine Of Heav'nly-Fire, in earthly Cinders lies. Then, they shall come to understand and know, That many future things I did behold, Beside that one, which is acknowledg'd now To be fulfilled, as it was foretold. But, MVSE, thou art almost without the List: Returne againe to thy Antagonist. Thou chargest us, Delusion, with such things As no way correspond with our intentions, And, proofe whereof, no creature living brings: For, they indeed are meerly thy inventions. The goods of none we ceaze, or sequestrate, Because, they to the King, are faithfull friends; But, for their faithlesnesse unto the State, And, serving Him, to base and evill ends. Nor of our Soveraigne, censure we amisse: But them we rightly judge, that him misguide; For, in his Actions, that which evill is, To them pertaines, who draw his heart aside. In publike Acts, The King can do no wrong, Because, unto his Counsell they belong. The King can do no wrong, as he is King: For, God ordained, and man did intend, Him, not to hurt, or plagues on them to bring, But, for their good, and good men to defend. The King, as King, can do no wrong; because He can do nothing, but, what he may do According to divine, and humane Lawes; And, what the publike-peace invites him to. The King can do no wrong; because, what ere He doth as King, is never duely done, But, by some publike Vote, or Officer, Or, they consenting, if he act alone. For, all he doth, whence any wrong proceeds, Are not his Royall, but his private deeds. The King can do no wrong: For, if there be Injustice done; his Officers are they Who did it: and, by Law they onely be Accomptable. And, therein, praise I may The wisdome of our Lawes; for, had there been By them, provided Legall Punishment For Kings; no man would be a King, I ween, But he, that could not such a Lot prevent. For, were it so; Then, if Court-Parasites Corrupt young Kings, and draw them to command That sin, whereto their ill-advice invites, Kings, at the Barre, for their Offence, might stand: And they might free themselves from ev'ry thing Which they mis-doe; and lay it on the King. And, who would be their Officers, if Kings Were liable to Legall punishment In person (as a Subject) for the things Mis-done by their commandment, or assent? For, if they shall be Tyrants, or such Princes, As make but little conscience of their way, Whom will not they accuse of those Offences, To free themselves from suffring, if they may? And, then though they accuse men innocent, Who would not think a King should be beleev'd Before his Vassall? and appear content He, thereby, should from suffering, be repreev'd? Yea, great absurdities from thence might flow, If Law conceiv'd, the King a wrong might do. The King can do no wrong; and, therefore, those Who shall his personall commands obey, In ought which doth his Legall Will oppose, Should beare, alone, that paine the Law doth lay: Beeause, the Law of nothing els takes heed, But, onely of those things which it commands, Or, of those evills which it doth forbid; And, for no private will, or pleasure stands. The King can do no wrong: For, it destroyes The Effence of a King: and, doth deprive Of ev'ry Priviledge which he enjoyes By Virtue of a Kings Prerogative. And, from Allegiance frees in ev'ry thing, Which he commands, beseeming not a King. For, unto Kings, is our Allegiance sworn, Not unto Tyrants, who shall fondly dreame That Kingdomes have beene made, and Subjects born, For nothing else, but to be slaves to them. Yet, here mistake me not: we are not (tho They tyrannize) from all Allegiance free; But, onely, from an Obligation to Obedience, in those things that lawlesse be. We, to their legall wills and pleasures, ever Must yeeld submission; and, with due respects, In ev'rie act of Loyaltie persever. And, leave to God, their personall defects. For, well enough great misciefes it prevents, When Law takes hold, of all their Instruments. What can a King to harme the publike, doe In his owne person? If by Law we may Lay hold on those, that counsell him unto A wrong? and those whom he shall mis-employ? If in the lawfull-powre, a Right there be; And, there with, Strength enough to seize on Them; He hurts us not. And, if too weake are we, What get we, though the Law might punish Him? Then, as his Person by our Law, is freed From ev'rie violence (except from that Which may restraine his Person from a deed Destructive to his Person, or the State; So be it ever free. And, blest be those, That, serve him, with true service where he goes, We, no man charge with treasons, none we blame, That, guiltlesse is of his imputed crime, And free from just suspitions of the same; As will be rendred manifest, in time. The King, from all aspersions cleare would we, Which without publike dammage might be hid, Though, to himself, those things assum'd hath he, Which (as a King) we know, he never did. What earthly wisdome can a means devise His honour to preserve, against his will? Or, do him right, that hearkens unto lies? Yet, this, we, to our pow'r, endeavour still. And, free we are, from being justly blam'd, For having, wilfully, the King defam'd. We none seduce, but, labour, how we may Prevent seducements, by right informations; And, those effects, to change, or take away, Which may arise from lying Declarations. By us, no Member of the Parliament Was driven thence: But, for their private ends, Vnworthily, some from that service went, Which ev'ry worthy Member stil attends. Some, to the King repair'd, in hope, to get A Title: Some, because they had mis-done: Some wanted honesty, some wanted wit; Some went, because their Mistresses were gone. Some fled for company; and, some did fly, (If I am not deceiv'd) they knew not why. Thus much I know: that He, who led them forth, And They, who follow'd him, in hope to find A Cloud, to hide their project, in the North; Did leave us, nor so sottish, nor so blind, But that we found their aimes; and soon perceiv'd, What tales, they meant, the people should believe; What hooks they baited, and what webs they weav'd, The (soone-misguided) people to deceive. And, he, that will, may know, that, neither They Who follow'd, neither He, that went before, Knew reason, why he should depart away. For, here he might have stayed, honour'd more, More safe, more fear'd, more lov'd, more happy, here Then they, or we, by their departure were. Could any, but meer impudence, averre That nothing, of our due, the King denies? When they who chief in our Oppressions are, Are, at this day, most favour'd in his eyes? Can we have hope our safeties to enjoy, When they are still his Counsell, who intend Our lawfull Rights, and Freedoms, to destroy? And, thither all their force and cunning bend. Is true Religion like to be maintain'd? While they, who innovated ev'ry day, (And, have their old Affections, yet retain'd) Are kept in hope their former parts to play? Or, can we think, the Popish Generation Are arm'd, for our Religions preservation? Can we have in us, either heart or braines, If we believe this? when to mind we call How great a multitude of soules complains, Which in the Irish-Massacre did fall? If we propose before our ears, and eyes, The horrid murthers of our brethren there, Their fears, their sad destractions, and their cries, When, by their Butchers, they surprized were. How terrible it was, when they beheld Their bloudy neighbours, rudely rushing in, And, saw, perhaps, their dear companions kild, By those, with whom they had familiar bin, Yea, saw, before they doubted, cause of fear, A murth'rer, or a mischief, ev'ry-where. If we remember, that the mazed Father, And, trembling mother, in the winter-night, Were forc'd, in hast, without their cloaths, to gather Their children up, and, with them, take their flight Through fields, and boggs, and woods, with naked feet, Lesse fearing thirst, and hunger, frost, and snow, Then with those cursed Edomites to meet; Who neither manhood, nor compassion know. If we consider, why they first began Their hellish Tragedie; how great a flood In ev'rie Irish Towne, and Village, ran Of harmlesse Protestant and English blood; How, in their tortures and their feares, they joy'd; And what great numbers they had soone destroy'd. If we consider this, and that a Nation So bloodie minded, and professing too A worship which is our Abomination, Should by his Majestie be favour'd so, That after all their mischiefe, all their spoile And cruelties, committed in that Land, They should be called over to this Ile, To kisse (with good respect) the Royall-hand. Can we, these things considering, symptomes finde, That ought for us, but mischiefe is intended, To soule and body? Can we have a minde So sottish, as to hope to be befriended In our Religion, by the Kings protection? While such as these, have place in his affection? Maintaineth he our Lawes, as he hath sworne, When he maintaines Law-breakers, in despight Of common equitie? And, as in scorne Of Justice, at the root of Law doth smite? Or, doth he keepe his oath, though he alone Allowes of Lawes enacted heretofore? If he to us denyes, as he hath done, What might secure the common safetie more? Or, hath he done his dutie, in denying His, and the Kingdomes counsell, to embrace? Or, in imprudent, and unjust complying With Parasites, to his, and their disgrace? Or, valuing men of Rascall Reputations, Before the wisest of three noble Nations? No change in Church or Commonwealth we crave, But, what Gods Word, and Reason shall allow. That, we are bound to seeke, and ought to have; And what that is, hereafter you shall know. Our Churchmens honour we envied not; But, could, what they enjoyed, have allow'd, Had it beene rightly us'd, and fairly got. But, they have long beene lazie, false, and proud. And, I foretold them many yeares agoe, The course they tooke, in hope thereby to stand, Should cause their fall. And, if it now be so; It is the worke of God Almighties hand: And, since it proves, their honour did them hurt; I am content, to see it, in the durt. The King is not obliged to uphold Their outward pompe; when his great Counsell shall Informe, that if the same abide it should, It may become the ruining of all. Him, doth his Oath or Place, engage, to cherish A rotten Member? though by doing so, The whole Republike may grow sick, and perish? Or Pietie receive her overthrow? Or, should we fancie that the Law intended, This Realmes whole bodie, should not be beleev'd? When they complain'd of that which them offended? And told which way they best might be releev'd? Or can he think, his Oath he broken had, When they shall him acquit, for whom twas made? When on the Prelates, Law did first confirme Their Dignities; the common-people thought They came from God; so wisely they could charme, To compasse for themselves, the things they sought. And, ev'rie age brought forth a man or two, Whose knowledge and whose pietie made way For them, who came, another work, to do; And, whose first founder, now, discerne we may. Then, since we now discover them, to be Not Christs Apostles, as we once beleev'd, But, Engines for the Papall-Monarchie, And hypocrites, by whom we were deceiv'd: Why should we now suppose we do them wrong, To take away, what they have kept too long? Why should we think it sacriledge, or sin? To take both wealth and dignities away From those, to whom they never due have bin? And, such as would the Cause of Christ betray? Why should his Jewels by his Foes be worn? Why on his bread should Droanes and Robbers feed? To cloath a wolfe, why should a sheep be shorn? Or they be spar'd, whose fall is fore-decreed? Let them learn true humility of Christ, And, study how in Spirit to be poor; Their earthly honours will not then be mist: Their want of wealth, will be a want no more: And, they shall honour GOD, and blesse the day, In which he took their needlesse Trash away. It is my grief, that I am forc'd to bring Those Reasons of defence which may appear Reflecting on the honour of the King, Which keep I would from all aspersions clear. But, his dear Favourites have blended so His Acts with their designes, and their, with his: That, we their malice cannot fully show, Without some touch, on what he doth amisse. And, that consider'd, makes their fault the greater; And, Him (though their ill-service he approve) To them, for, what they claime, the lesse their debter; Because, his Honour they but little love: For (till these Times) though Courtiers plaid the knave, They sav'd their Honours, who, them sought to save. But, whatsoever, by the Parliament, Or by my Pen, he seemeth to have lost In point of Honour; if he shall assent To that, which will be nothing to his cost, But, rather for his profit; Let the same Be, at my hands, requir'd: unlesse I shall Finde out, not onely means, whereby his Name Shall publikely stand faire, and clear from all Dishonourable staines; but, also shew How his, may, all his Predecessors glory Out-shine: and, leave to times that shall ensue, An everlasting honourable Story. Which to believe, me thinks he should be mov'd, Since, all I yet fore-told him, true hath prov'd. Gods will be done; within whose pow'rfull hands The hearts of Princes are; and, let us wait With patience, till, for us, his Grace commands That aid, which make things crooked to be streight. Meane-while, we must not those just means neglect, Which to the publike safety may pertaine: Nor cease from doing good, though an effect, Not purpos'd, make him causlesly complaine. Our Cause we must expostulate; that, We May, to the world, approve our innocence: And, that he may, thereby, informed be, How little cause we give of just offence. And, to that end, to what I said before, In our defence, Ile add a little more. Though others may be fool'd with Protestations, And, words or oaths; which, peradventure, none Did vow, or make, but he, whose Declarations Have, lately, for the Kings, among us gone. The Parliament hath many piercing eyes, That, in the dark, descry their foes devices: And, by discov'ring of their Treacheries, Ere they come forth, destroyes those Cockatrices. When mischiefs are, by Providence, fore-seen, And, then prevented: they that would have done them, Make Friends, and Fooles, beleeve they had not been, Because, they were destroid ere they begun them, Yet, some, who saw not where the Foxes went, Can finde where they have haunted, by their scent. What things the King hath sworne, I doe not heare; But, should he sweare ten times, and ten times over, There were no cause to dread, what yet we feare, Me, of that feare, his Oathes could not recover: For, though I should beleeve, that he thought true What he had sworne: yet, what should me assure That he his owne Designes should still pursue? Or, that unchanged he shall still endure? And, though his heart bide fixt, how can I know That, he shall still have powre to doe me right? Since they, who seeke his Kingdomes overthrow, Alreadie, are Commanders of his might? And, so prevailing, that, in him, I see Nor Will, nor Powre, his owne true friend to be? Though others can beyond beleefe, beleeve, And, hope beyond all hope; I cannot, yet, In Reasonable things, permission give Vnto my Fancie, to befoole my Wit. In flights-divine, my Contemplation flies, Without restraint: But, in all humane things, My Vnderstanding, still, my Iudgement ties To Reasons principles; or clips her wings. What ever, therefore, other doe, or say; What ever sounds, or showes, I see, or heare; Each weightie-matter, by it selfe, I weigh, With ev'rie circumstance, that may appeare: And, when that all things I have throughly prov'd, I silent am, or speak, as I am mov'd. So did I in this Cause, before I dar'd Resolve upon the course, that I have tooke. And, e're I hither came, came so pepar'd. That, nothing to affright me, can be spoke. Though all, for whose defence, I hither come, Should use me worse then yet my foes have done, (As, I already have been us'd by some) I would not leave the path I have begun; But, meerly for the justnesse of the Cause, And conscience sake, perform my best endeavour To vindicate Religion, and the Lawes: And, in this duty to my death persever; That, I may live to see our Freedome sav'd: Or, bravely die, before I am inflav'd. For, though some, wilfully; and, weakly, some Object unto us, that in Primitive, And purer ages, Christians did not come With Fire and Sword, the Law of Faith to give: Nor seek by force of armes, to make defence Against those Tyrants, in whose lands they taught; (Much lesse, came arm'd, against their native Prince) To settle that Religion which they brought. This argument of their is but a cheat, To cozen Innocencie, with a show That's empty: For, the difference is great Betwixt their Cause, and that, we mannage now. VVhich I should make more plainly to appeare, But, that too tedious, for this place, it were. They had no Party, to defend their cause; They came to preach, where Freedomes they had none; The Sword was not allowed by their Lawes; And, greatest good, by suffring, might be done. To Ruffia, or to Turkie, should I goe Our Faith to publish there; the likeliest way To settle it, would then be sufferance, too: And, meekly, on the block, my head to lay. Must therefore, we permit the Whore of Rome, To send her Bastards, and her Fornicators? (Whom Law forbids within our coasts to come) To teach her Baudrie to our sons and daughters? And, make the Kings, and Princes, of these Nations, Drunk with the Feees of her Fornications? Because, the Martyrs suffred by that State, Whose settled way of Worship, they gainsaid? Must, downe to those, who come to innovate Our settled Truth; this Kingdomes neck be laid? Shall we be able an account to render, For our neglect; now we in danger see (Of Romish-Slaverie) our Faiths-Defender, If we endeavour not to set him free? Shall we sit still, and whine, when Law, and Reason Cries out All-arme? untill we be, indeed, Traitors; by fearing Loyaltie is Treason? And bring both Plagues and Curses on our Seed? Doe as you please, my way to me is knowne; And, I will walk it, though I walke alone. For, that without a partiall inclination (To either side) the right I might disclose, It was, and is my full determination, To set aside respect of friends or foes. And, let me be, by both of them abhorr'd, If I now utter, or have uttred ought, For private ends; or, what shall not accord, In ev'ry sentence, with a loyall thought. To keep me from Delusion, I have pray'd; I have look'd up, above me, to discover What notions, may be downe to me convayd; Of those things which above our heads, doe hover. And, downe below me, I have cast mine eyes, To mark what fogs may up from hell arise. About me I have look'd, on either side, On disagreeing, and agreeing actions: The manners, and the speeches I have tride, Of most Professions, all Degrees, and Factions. And, from them all, have made for my directions, (And for my informations in this Cause) A chaine of Observations, and Collections; From whence, my Iudgement, her conclusions drawes. Behind me, I have look'd, to take a view, Of what was done, or suffred, heretofore: What did on this, what did on that, ensue: What makes a Curse, or Blessing, lesse, or more. And, I have look'd before me too; and see Events of things, that shall hereafter be. I have consider'd what I had foreseene In that great Plague, which this Kings Raigne began: What I foretold him; what fulfill'd hath beene; What courses He and His, since that time ran. I have considerd, why I did prefer That hearty-prayer, for Him, which yet stands, As registred, in my Remembrancer; And hath beene published through all his Lands. I have considerd well, what kinde of men Were then his Counsellors; and, who are now: What Parliaments and Promises, were then Made void: and what effects from thence did flow. How fast, injurious Projects were encreast; How cruelly, the people were opprest. I have well weigh'd, what persons were preferd In Church and Commonwealth; and, with what sleight Acceptance (if not with a disregard) All honest services they did requite. Their Proclamations, did from yeare to yeare, Proclaime to me, much more then they intended I should have knowne. And, though I silent were, I could have told, in what they should have ended. The Life, and suddaine Death of Buckingham, The Voyages of Rochel, and of Ree, And other things, whereto I privie am, Were true Prognostications unto me; And, to my understanding more foretold, Then all the Constellations did unfold. And, though I live among the Country Clownes, (As one who scarcely knew, or heeded ought) The Spanish-Fleet that perish'd on the Downes, I heard of; and, to minde it somewhat brought. Sometimes, I have intelligence from Rome; And, know what in the Conclave hath beene done. I have observed other men, to come On businesse thence, as well as Senior Con. I know Archbishop Laud; and he knows me, The worse for him, by many hundred pounds; For which, I recompenced looke to be, When he, againe, at Lambeth walks his Rounds. And, I, from these, though they suppose not so, Some Reasons drew, for that, which now I doe. I heard, of what, within their Cabinet, The Machiavilian-Counsellers debate; And, information, other while, did get, Of ill-presaging secresies of State. The German-horse, that should have trotted hither; Prodigious Straffords projects, deeds, and triall, With other Characters, speld all together, Have showne me Truths, that can have no deniall. And, when my heart had rightly pondred these, Weigh'd, what they are, with whom we have to doe; Their words, their hopes, their lives, their practices, What things they seek, whom they belong unto, With such like notes, as these; me thinks, they be All blinde men, who perceive not what I see. And, when I had with these considerations, Consider'd too, for what a worthlesse Crew, The suits and cries of two most loyall Nations, Have wanted those effects which are their due: That He, who for the Sheep, his life should give, Can give them to the Wolves, and see them slaine: That He, who should our grievances releeve, Can adde unto our torment, and our paine: That He, because we feare his Dogs will bite, (And, for that reason, pray they may be ty'd) Can therefore, let them loose, and take delight To see them kill, whom they have terrifide: These things considered, me thinks, we wrong The Humane-nature, to be tame so long. When I perceived our deare Countries Father, So peremptorily affect his will, That, he would hazard three brave Kingdomes, rather, Then his unlawfull pleasure, not fulfill; And, when I saw the Devils, who inspire This wilfulnesse into him, ceaze the goods Of his best subjects; their faire houses fire; Deflowre their Virgins; shed their Old-mens bloods; Betray their nearest Kinsmen, slay their Brothers; Deprive the blamelesse Infants of their lives; Enslave their Fathers, kill their frighted Mothers: Abuse their Daughters, and defile their Wives: It griev'd me, that this Iland should afford One man, who for this Quarrell drew no sword. But, since I have consider'd, that, from Rome These Plagues, these mischiefes, these unhappy warres, And all, our present miseries, did come, With our unequall'd Irish-Massacres: And, that (beside the many thousands here) Well nigh two hundred thousand Protestants Were slaine, and rooted thence, within one yeare, By those, to whom the King high favours grants: And, since tis (not improbably) beleev'd, They called are to be our Butchers too: (If we permit our selves to be deceiv'd, Till they can compasse what they meane to doe) Me thinks, we have not beene so tame, as mad, To have so slow a hand, as we have had. And, lastly, since I weigh'd, that, not alone A plot is laid three Kingdomes to undoe, But also, in their spoile, to have undone, All other true Reformed-Churches too: That, Gods own glorie, and the servitude Of Christian soules, is in this Cause concern'd; From thence (whatever other will conclude) I, these Conclusions, with good Warrant, learn'd: That, those whom in this Warfare we resist, Are, neither worse, nor better, but, those Bands, And those Confederates of Antichrist, Which are to be his Champions, in these Lands. And, that whoever fighteth on their side, When this is known, hath God, &amp; Christ deni'd. I see, as plainly as I see the Sun, He draweth neare, that, on the Rev. 19. 11. white horse rides. The long-expected Battell is begun: The Beast, to muster up his Kings, provides: With him, will all his Edomites conspire; The seed of Hagar, and the sonnes of Lot: Philistia, Gebal, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, And, all that with his Mark themselves bespot. Those brave white-Regiments, me thinks, I see, That, on the Lord of Lords, &amp; King of Kings, Attending in triumphant habits be; And, which, with him, against our foes he brings. Me thinks, I hear his Rev. 19. 17. Angel call the Crowes, To eat the Kings, and Captains of our foes. If this be so; as, with a heart unfain'd I do believe it is: how brave a lot Have we? that were, before all worlds, ordain'd, To be, for souldiers, to the Lamb, begot? With what high courage should we march along Against this Foe? That, being Conquerours, We may, with Angels, sing a Triumph-Song, And, crowned sit, among Celestiall Powers? Why should we be afraid to speak, or write, What may, from his curst Army, fetch our King? Why should we feare, to perish in that Fight, Which will through Death, to Life immortall bring? Or, why should any, now, this work delay? Or, doubt the truth of that which here I fay? I beg no grace from King, or Parliament, If an Impostor I shall prove to be: Or, if men find not by the Consequent, That, GOD hath spoken to this Land, by me: And, that the maine of all my Musings were Inspir'd by Him; though, often, he permit My foolishnesse, among them, to appeare, That, nothing be ascribed to my Wit. Excuse I crave not, but a just correction, Or, Approbation, as my words may merit. If an ill-spirit hath been my direction, What thereunto pertains, let me inherit. And, if the truth be spoken, do not grieve me, VVithout a cause; but, hearken, and believe me. Suppose not (my deare Countrimen) that here I have been over-bold, although you see A bitternesse doth in my lines appear: For, in this Cause, great things concerned be: It doth concern our children, and our wives. The publike safetie, and the publike good; The honour of our Nation, and our lives, The just avengement of our brethrens blood: The freedome of our persons, and estates; The honour, and the safetie of our King: Our present being, and our future fates, And, almost, ev'ry other precious thing: Yea, it concerns our souls: and, more then so, It highly doth concern GODS glory too. Now then, for conscience, or, for shame, begin To call to minde the duties that ye owe: Let what appears without, be found within; That, by your actions, we your hearts may know. For your own sakes (if not for GODS, and our) Be zealous in the cause you undertake: Lest you, ere long, have neither means, nor pow'r, Your peace with GOD, or Them, or Vs, to make. For, both to GOD, and man, above all creatures, The most abhorred, are those hypocrites, Who can comply with disagreeing natures, Yet, false to all, but to their appetttes. Take, therefore, counsell from a souldiers Pen: And (while you may) be warn'd, be wise, be men. Asham'd (if not a little mad) I am, To see so many, in this cause, so cold, So false, so faint, so cowardly and tame, That can, in other causes, be so bold. And (not without affliction) this, I say: Should this good cause miscarrie, all our foes Are not more guilty of it, then are they, Who give it, unperceiv'd, and secret blowes. None do it so much dammage; none so wrong us. As they, who seem to be our faithfull friends; They, who at meat, and counsell, sit among us; And, serve the publike; for their private ends. Our Scœne of bloud, ere this, had els been done: And, peradventure, never been began. In ev'ry Village, Town and Corporation, Let all, that are true Protestants profest, Let ev'ry Canton, Province, Tribe, and Nation, Which doth against the Romish-Whore protest, A timely League, with one another make; Vnite themselves by firme Associations; And, by a sacred Covenant, courses take Both for their joynt, and sev'rall preservations. And, to be sure, they make a firm defence Against their foes fierce furie, and despight; Let them be cloth'd, with Love, and Innocence, Arm'd, with that armour, wherewith Christians fight; And, be prepared, alwayes, to resist The Body, and the Limbs, of Antichrist. Feare not the furie of your present Foes, For, by their mixture, you discover may They are but part of that great STATVES toes, Whose Feet were made of Iron, and of Clay. If they receive but one good knock, or twaine, The Clay, and Iron, will divided be: The Protestant will be himselfe againe: For, Light and Darknesse never can agree. Though horn'd, but like the LAMB, they yet appear, (Pretending to be arm'd for innocence) Their Voices do discover what they are; And, that the DRAGONS Creature is their Prince. Oh therefore, as you love your preservation, Give eare, ye Britans, to this Proclamation: Charles by the grace of God, the Sov'raigne King, Of England, Scotland, Ireland, and of France, Intending in his heart no other thing, But, how his Regall powre he might advance, In that pursuit, a little straying from His faithfull Parliament, through ill advice, Was by an ambuscado, sent from ROME, Surprized lately, in a traiterous wise: And (whereof all good subjects should have sense) Imprison'd lyes: where both his eies and eares, So poysned are, by false intelligence, That, nothing he, now, truly sees, or heares. As by those Actions, which his name doe beare, It may, now, too apparently appeare. Moreover, they have in despight of Law, Advanc'd a Popish Armie, by some showes Of what they purpose not; and, daily draw The Protestants, each other to oppose. And, have so fairly cov'red their intention, That, what they could not, by themselves, have wrought, We may assist them in, till past prevention Their Plot, and our destruction shall be brought. Come therefore, Oh all ye! that are profest The sonnes of Reformation! Come away, From giving your assistance to the Beast; Lest, in his Judgement, you be swept away. On paine of ruine, Come, and helpe to bring Our Sov'raigne home: And so, God save the King. Let him, that would a Christian man appeare, His drowzie soule awake, and rouze his Faith. Let him, that hath an eare to heare, give eare To that, which through my Trunk, the Spirit saith: And, cursed let him be, till he repent (His wilfulnesse) that, when he heares this Muse, And feeles his heart, inclining to assent, (To what is true) her counsell shall refuse. Accursed let him be, on like condition, That through a Selfe-conceit, or thorow Pride, Shall blast these usefull Musings, with suspition Of ill intents; or, my just hopes deride: Or, by his envie, malice, or neglect. Deprive them, of their purposed effect. Accursed let those Townes, and Cities be, Which willing entertainment did afford To our Pursuers; and, were glad to see Their Armies with them, both at Bed, and Boord. The curse of Meroz, and those execrations, Which to her base Inhabitants befell, Alight on their Malignant-habitations; And, that of Succoth, and of Penuel: Till they with shame and sorrow, shall repent Their falshood to themselves, and to their friends: Their falshood to the King and Parliament: And, help to bring those Traitors to their ends. And let all Places, which have done their best Against those Rebels; be, for ever, blest. And (if my Sentence, which is here recorded May passe for good) let ev'ry one of those That hath for any services, beene Lorded, Wherein, their God, or Country they oppose, Weare his false Badge of Honour, ev'rie where, With infamie, with beggerie, and scorne; With terrible vexations, and with feare, Till his unworthie Name away be worne: Or, till, by some apparent penitence, By God, a pardon shall to him be given: And, then, let all his folly, and offence, Remitted be on earth, as 'tis in heaven. And, so let all the rest, by my consent, Like mercy finde, as soone as they repent. For, we are all transgressors: he that's best Is bad, and but a Brier, or a Thorne. He, that among us hath trangressed least, Deserves more plagues, then he that's worst hath borne. He, that hath much offended, hath, perchance, Not out of wilfulnesse, offensive bin: But, through temptation, or through ignorance; For which, true penitence may mercie win. Yea, some, perhaps, who most of all offend, Were left to their corruptions, for our crimes: And, when we shall our wicked lives amend, They shall repent, and we have better times. Yet, still, most blessed be those men, and places, Who from this Battell, have not turn'd their faces. For ever blessed, and renown'd, for ever, Let Glo'ster be; that, being far from aid, Did in her firmnesse, gloriously persever, When round her Wals, the King his armie laid. For ever, let the towne of Manchester Be blest and famous; that, with slender Guard, Without a neighboring-second (and well neare Without all helpes) her dangers all outdar'd: And, by God's aid, alone, did trample downe The powre, and pride of Darbies armed son: Yea, where the Popish-Faction, strongst was growne, Prevail'd, in spight of all that spight had done: And, hopefull bides, that He, who did befriend Her paines, thus far, will blesse it to the end. And, far above them all, renown'd, and blessed Let London be, who for the preservation Of three great Kingdomes, wofully distressed, Hath acted things begetting admiration. For ever, let her Bountie, and her Zeale, Her Constancie, her Counsels, and her Pray'rs, Her Valour also for the Commonweale, When we were almost sunk into despaires: Let all these, be remembred, to her glory: And, let her high deservings by the same, Be so recorded in some well writ Story, That, all great Cities may envy her fame, And, so to honour her, let us agree, That, all her praises, to God's praise, may be. Let all those Worthies also, that have done, Or, suffred bravely, for the Common-good, In this great Cause (untill Times round is run) Be blest and honour'd, in their Names, and Blood. Let valiant Essex, Warwicke, Manchester, Stout Fairfax, Waller, Roberts, Brooke, and Gray, (Who forward for the publike safety were) Be crowned with a never-dying Bay. So crown'd be Skippon, Mericke, Stapleton, With Hampden, Massy, Bruerton, and Gel: The English and the Scottish Middleton, My noble, and my valiant Colonel. And, let nor malice, time, nor death, be able, To make them lesse then good, and honourable. Remembred be, with an heroick fame, Balfore, and Ramsey, Cromwel, and D'Albere, The Meldroms, and he chiefly of that Name, Whose worth did in relieving Hul appeare. Let mention'd be with honourable-men, Much daring Luke, and Hazelrig the bold: Aldridge, Browne, Barcley, Holborne, Harvie, Ven, Brooke, Norton, Springer, Morly, More, and Gold. To all of these, whose worth shall reall be, Let reall honours be: and, be it so, To all of good desert, unknowne to me; Of whom there are, I hope, some thousands moe, Whose memorie, shall never be forgot: Though, here, to name them, I remember not. Let them, that shall hereafter counted be Most honourable persons, never more Be they, who shew the longest Pedigree, From Kings, and Conquerors, as heretofore: But, such as are most worthy: and, next them, Their Off-spring, who were Patrons for this Cause. And let them share more honour and esteem, Then he that his descent, from Princes drawes. For, if it may enoble, to be borne Of those, who out of avarice, or pride, From others, wrongfully, their lands have torne: How much more, ought they to be dignifide, That, from the loines of parents, are descended, Whose Swords, their Country, King, and Faith defended? And, to make full my blessing: three times blessed, Be ev'ry Member of the Parliament, Which hath not been unwillingly oppressed, With burthens, our undoing to prevent. Blest, be their constancy, and blest their paines, With safety, credit, and with consolations, And, with all blessednesse which appertaines, To make them happy, through all Generations. And, blessed be the King, with such a heart, And, such a resolution, to retire To us in love: that he may have a part In all that blisse, which we our selves desire. And, that from these our troubles, I may raise A Trophie, to his honour, and GODS praise. Before, my tongue had finish'd this defence, To warrant my ingagement: that Delusion Which had so hotly charg'd me, sneaked thence, And, staid not, to give eare to my conclusion. Her forces vanished, (and she with them) Consisting, chiefly, of their Sophistries Who had been prest out of that Academ, In which, the Magazine of mischief lies. It was, first, founded for a Court of Knowledge, (A schoole of duties, morall and divine) And, to that end, had many a goodly Colledge, To nurse up youth, by prudent Discipline: But, 'twas, of late, a nest of Birds unclean; And, is now made the Wolves, and Lions den. My foes departed, I began to sleight Their Trenches, and the Forts which they had rear'd: Those Engines, likewise, I demolish'd quite, That make young souldiers of their force afeard: And, was at leisure, then, my selfe to please, With other thoughts; and, thither to retreat, Where I might be refresht, and take mine ease, With such provisions, as my men could get. My Quarter was the Field: my Tent and Bed, A well-made Barley-cocke: the Canopie And Curtains, which, to cover me, were spread, No meaner then the starre-bespangled skie. GOD set the Watch; the Guard, he also kept, And, without harm, or feare, I safely slept. Next morne, before the dawning of the day, My heart awoke; and, warm'd with GODS protection, (And with his love) did praise him, and assay To meet him, with reciprocall affection. My purpose he accepted, and descended To impe the wings that mount my contemplation. And, kindly, raised, strengthned, and befriended My soule, by sweet, and usefull meditation: With musings on things present, on things past, And things to come, he exercis'd my thought. Some, of his mercies, gave my soule a taste; Of sin, and judgement, some, the relish brought. By some, I did my private duties learne: And, some, the Publike-safetie did concerne. One Ray, forth-darting from his pow'r-divine, (Whose way of working cannot well be told) Infus'd into my heart, a high Designe, Which, with good liking, now, I might unfold. But hark! the Trumpet calls me to the field: My horses, are already at the doore. Place to the Sword, my Pen, againe, must yeeld: At better leasure, I may tell you more. To what, I further purpose to declare, This, for an Introduction, is prepar'd: And, if I finde, you so well temper'd are, That, more (with hope of profit) may be heard; I'le tell you Newes, which, yet, is but a Dreame, And, Vox Pacifica, shall be my Theame. A Voice, not of a Vaine Pacification, Form'd out of Ecchoes, or uncertaine sounds: But, of a Peace, of whose blest confirmation, There shall be likely Hopes, and reall Grounds. A Voice, in somewhat, imitating his, Who (to prepare the great Messiah's way) Became a Crier in the Wildernesse; And, to beget Repentance, will assay. A Voice, that shall prepare the way of Peace. A Peace, that shall with Righteousnesse, embrace. And, by their sweet embracements, more encrease The Peace of Conscience, and the Peace of Grace. A Peace, which, if my hopes effect I can, Shall reconcile us, both to God, and Man. A Peace, not closing up a festring sore, To ease, but for a while the present smart: And, making afterward the torments more, By spreading mortall Gangrenes, to the heart. A Peace, that by a true-love-knot, shall knit Three Nations, with such nearnesse, into One; That, nothing shall have pow'r to loosen it, But, wilfull sin, impenitently done. A Peace, which to the People, and the King, Shall (if not hindred by some Crying-sin) Truth, honour, wealth, powre, rest, and safety bring: And, keep us everlastingly therein. This Peace I seek; this Peace, that God may send, My soule doth pray; and, so, these Musings end. Sic dixit, qui sic cogitavit: Et, prædicando quod putavit, Haud multum peccat, si peccavit. All the Glorie be to GOD. What Peace to the wicked? OR, An Expostulatorie Answer TO A Derisorie Question, Lately made CONCERNING PEACE. BY A Free-man, though a Prisoner. The Author spares his Name; not, that he dares not To let you know it; but, because he cares not. One, who hath, seldome, in his daies, From Fools, or Knaves, had love or praise; And, who, throughout this Isle, is knowne, With cheerfulnesse, to have bestowne, His Wit, Paines, Person and Estate, The Publike-Rights to vindicate, A long imprisonment hath had, For calling of a Spade, a Spade; Which (if a Court-Card) might have been Next to the King, except the Queen. As He, in his confinement lay, Some asked him, the other day, When he suppos'd this Warre should end, Or what successes would attend Our hopes of Peace: which Question, tho From Levity it seem'd to flow, Or, scoffingly, to be exprest, Receiv'd this Answer, not in jest. Why ask ye when this Warre will cease? Or, when this Kingdome shall have Peace? As if you thought, I could fore-shew What things hereafter would ensue: Or, as if when the Truth were told, You value, or believe it could; Who, nor esteem, nor use have made Of those Fore-warnings you have had? They that will know what shall succeed, Must of Things-past take serious heed; And, gleane Instructions, whilst they may, From Actions of the present-Day: For, past, and present Time declares, What, for the Future, God prepares; And, till these quicken their fore-sights, Men sit in darknesse, till he smites. If to this Question, you would know An Answer, which the Truth shall show, And, not (with Ahab-like-Desires) Wish all your Prophets would be liers; Then, ask your Consciences, and they Will tell, what things expect you may: For, let my Troubles never cease, If ever some have other Peace Then what their Consciences fore-see, Though King and Parliament agree. But, lest the Conscience may be sear'd; Or, lest Delusions have appear'd, Which promise Peace, when she is fled, (And Vengeance hangeth over-head) Ask your own Feares, and humane-Reason, What they conjecture of the season: Ask them, what signe it is of Peace, When wickednesse doth more increase; What may be hop'd for of that Nation, That sleights her dayes of Visitation; That mendeth not for words, nor blowes; That, in reforming, worser growes; That suffers them who serve Her best, To be most wronged, and opprest; And, on her Face, all tokens hath Of desolation, and of wrath. When this is well inquired out, If still you shall remaine in doubt, What we may seem fore-doom'd unto; Let me perswade you thus to do. Get information, when the King Intends a Palinode to sing; When he will their ill-counsells leave, Who are deceived, and deceive: What setled peace we can devise, Whilst Irelands-blood for vengeance cries: Whilst they, who sought to have begot A Schisme betwixt Us, and the Scot, Have Trust, or Power: or, els, whilst they Escape unblam'd, who scandals lay Upon that Army, by whose hand God, hath from Thrall, redeem'd this Land; Both to the grief, and shame, of them, VVho, their beginnings did contemne. Or, whilst the person of the Prince, (VVhich traiterously was sent from hence) Is kept in France, to have some fine New-foolish-mischievous Designe Rais'd thereupon; for, who can tell, But, that, he there so long may dwell, As, his due birth-right to recover, And, bring his Peasant-Subjects over, To help perswade with us, that we VVould, here, be slaves, as, there, they be. Now, if this be the plot, I feare, It will be long, ere Peace be here. VVhat Peace can we expect, whilst they Who spoiled us, not onely may Finde mercy, (which we could allow) But, so imperious, also grow, As, to reproach us to our Faces, Ev'n in our priviledged-Places? Who, once, thought better fruits would come By that which we have parted from: But mark the end; and judge what Peace VVill follow, when your friends decrease; VVhen more Malignants are return'd; VVhen they who love the State, are scorn'd; And some, who serv'd it, heretofore, Are growne as mad, as they are poore. If, yet, you cannot well discerne, VVhen Peace will back again returne, Get knowledge, with all speed ye may, VVhat game Malignants have to play; How farre they have, as yet, to run In that wild Course, too soone begun; VVhen they are like to call to minde VVhat lies before them, and behinde; VVhat future-plot it may advance, To let so many passe to France, On their bare words, who carelesse are Of what they either say, or sweare: VVhat can be hoped-for, of those VVho are, irrationally, Foes: VVith safety, what we can propound, VVhere, little, save deceit, is found: Or, what good Harvest can be mowne, VVhere, onely, mischiefe hath been sowne: And, when these things are truly weigh'd, You'l thinke as much as may be said. If not; then, next, inquire, how long Divisions will be rais'd among The Lords and Commons; and, when we Shall finde both Houses so agree, That, to the publike detriment, Nor House, nor Member shall dissent, Or be united; but, insist Upon the common-interest; And, Priviledge, nor Custome, straine, An Innovation to maintaine, VVherby they may invade each other, Or, separate from one another: For, you have heard what lot betides A House, or Kingdom, that divides; And know, what's likely to succeed, Till our Peace-makers are agreed. If, wast, Jerusalem was made, VVho, therein, but three factions, had; This Island, how may we deplore, VVherein are three times three, and more! Some, with the Parliament partake; Some, for the King a party make, As he is King: And, some, that, He A Tyrant might become to be: Some, would a Popular-estate; Some, Aristocracie create: Some, are a faction, for the Pope; Some, to maintain the Prelates hope; Some, for the Presbyterians vote; Some, Independency promote, Some, strive for this, and some for that, Some, neither know, nor care for what, So Wars go on, and get they may Free-quarter, Plunder, and their Pay. Some, fight their Liberties to save; Some, that they others might inslave; Some, for Religion, and for CHRIST; Some, that, they may do what they list; Some, for the Common-wealths availe; Some, for themselves, with tooth, and naile; And, they that have the basest end, As fairly, as the best, pretend; Not caring, whether their desire Obtained be, by sword, or fire; By truth or lies, with love or hate; By treachery, or faire debate. This is our posture; and, whilst we So foolish, false, and factious be, Or whilst affaires continue thus) Who knowes what will become of us? Or, when the man, who these lines pen'd, Shall find good usage, or a friend? Ask those who now of peace do dream, Who, shall procure the same, for them, If many are become their foes, Whom they to be their Champions chose: If these our substance have bestown, To make new fortunes, of their own; If they the publike wrongs encrease, To gain themselves a private peace; If yet, the people doubtings have, What to refuse, or what to crave; If they unsetled, yet, abide, And constant unto neither side; If, scarcely, they resolved are, Whether, they would have peace, or warre; Or, whether re-admit they shall Charles to be King, or none at all; For, doubtlesse, if these matters go As honest men much fear they do, A wise man needs not break his brain To search what peace we shall obtain; Since, whilst thus blind, and mad we be, What will ensue, a foole may see. Ask of our Lords, that, were the skreen Which, anciently, did stand between The King, and Commons, what th'intaile Of titles, without power, availe To such an use; And, how the shade Of what their Predecessors had Shall find sufficiencie to do, What, oft, the substance reach'd not to: And, having weigh'd what they are now; What they have been; what they may grow, And, what we feare, till fixt they are, As honourably, in their spheare, As heretofore: Or, till the State Shall all her spheares anew create, And place them so, that, neither Orb Each others motion shall disturb; Think, what we justly may expect Those clashings will, at last effect, Which now obstructive are; and may Destructive prove, another day; If some new mischief should begin Without our circle, or within, Before the feinds appeas'd are grown, Which, we have almost conjur'd down: For, by consid'ring things like these, You may conjecture, if you please, (Without a new Prognostication) What will befall this Generation. Yet, least presumptions may arise (To foole you with false hopes and lies) Observe the Commons, if, of them, None serve two Masters at a time: Nay, search if none among them be Who, servants are, this day, to three, And false to all: Observe, of those Whom we for publike-service chose, How many fail'd the Common-trust; How vile some are, and how unjust: How perilous, and hard a taske It is, those Members to unmaske That, in affection, are unsound; How much more hard when they are found To cut them off: what mean effect The faithfull party must expect Concerning peace, while such as they The cunning Ambodexters play; And what small hope there is of rest, While we have Cancers in our breast. Ask them, who sit to take Accounts, To what their two years paine amounts; Or, what the Common-wealth it betters, When they have found who are her debters; If, when their guiltinesse is known, And published throughout the town, A cheating-Sharke may raile at them Who justly have convicted him; Yea, be employed as before, Where he may cheat the State of more; And be as confident, as tho He merited by doing so. Aske, if they have not power to call Aswell the great ones, as the small, To give accompt; Those, whom we heare Cum Privilegio (as it were) Have plunder'd, at an easie rate, Coyne, Jewells, Houshold-stuffe and Plate; And if you find they have not leave To question all men who deceive The Publike-Trust, know, we are yet, For Peace with Righteousnesse, unfit. Then search, if you have eyes to see Paths, that so blind, so crooked be, What courses those Committees take Which, every where, such rumblings make. Marke seriously, if they appeare Such, as the people say they are; So false, so proud, so insolent, So carelesse whom they discontent; So scandalous unto the State, In prosecuting private hate; So bold, from Equity to varie, By courses meerly Arbitrarie; And if you finde them to be such, You need not then to question much What will befall this harrowed Land, VVhile these Authorized shall stand. Then, mark what favours now some have Who sought these Kingdomes to inslave; How well-befriended, some appeare, Who Neuters were, and worse now are; How, some exposed be to scorne Who, of this warre, the heat have borne; What scandalls are of them devis'd; How their deserts are under-priz'd: And, having heedfully survey'd How good, with evill, is repay'd; Mind well the Doctrine, and the use, And think, what these things may produce. Enquire, moreover, how you find To workes of mercy, men inclin'd; How, their poor wives and children fare, Who for their Countrey slaughter'd are; How, honest causes are preferr'd; How speedily your suits are heard; How Offices conferred be; And if some have not two, or three, Who for the publike, neither spent, Nor gave, nor hazzarded, nor lent, Ought worth regard, whilst they have none, Who in your service, were undone. Observe, how equally men share Those Pensions which allowed are: How little Best-deservers get; How many of them, nere a whit; How conscionably, and, how well, Rewards, and Punishments, we deal, Which are the Pillars, whereon stand The Peace, and Honour of the Land. Observe, if when we spend a day In praises, or to fast, and pray, If preaching tend not more to strife. Then to sound-Doctrine, or good-life; If more we seeke not to fulfill Our sev'rall humours, and our will, Then to performe a Thank-oblation, Or, duties of Humiliation; Or, if the worship we professe, Be not an out-side holinesse, No deeper rooted then the tongue; Forc'd fruit, that fades as soon as sprung: For, as it proveth, when you see These things to tryall brought shall be, You may without much failing, ghesse, What likelihoods we have of Peace. Then, if you be not some of those Who slight what other men propose, How probable soere it seem, (Unlesse it may advantage them, Or propagate the private ends, Of their Confederates, and Friends) An eare, and eye, pray somtime have ye Upon our Armies, and the Navie: An eye, securely to behold, An eare to heare what hath been told, Of some, who much intrusted were With Armes, and with provisions there; Or, had Commissions to array, To furnish, fortifie, or pay Ships, Forts, or men: And, those in chief, Employ'd for Irelands first relief, And our first Armies; Ev'n, when all Did lye at stake, and seem to call For faithfull, stout, and honest men: Observe, how they discharged, then, The trust repos'd; how, some were made Commanders; pay, and titles had; But scarce a man: how, others, now, Have us'd the Commonwealth, and you: And, if in any, you shall find Deceit, in this accursed kind, Forgive them not; yea, when at last Acts of Oblivion shall be past For open foes; no grace provide For men untrue to their owne side, Least, as our Peace they have defer'd, They marre it, likewise, afterward: But, as occasions offered be, Find them, although you mind not me: For, where, in favour, such are found Then peace is made, 'twill not be sound. Enquire, (if you can tell of whom To make enquirie) what's become Of all the publike Protestations, Engag'd for private Reputations; What, of that Vow, which did expresse A mutuall-aid, in all distresse; What of the selfe-denying Vote, Which godly hopes in us begot; What of those Orders, whereupon Some trusted, till they were undone; What of the publike-Faith, in which We thought our selves exceeding rich, Though all were lost, so that remain'd Unviolated, and unstain'd: Enquire (I say) throughout the Land, In what condition these now stand; For, when of these you have obtain'd That certaintie, which may be gain'd, It will, undoubtedly, appeare What we may either hope or feare. Inquire yet further, (least you may Expect perhaps a Sunshine-day, And meet a storme) in what good mind That sort of people you shall find Ycleep'd the Clergie: For, the Stem, Of all our mischiefs was in Them. Their faction, avarice, and pride, Did, first of all, this Isle divide. From them, at first, the Fireband came That set this Empire in a flame; When 'twas nigh quench'd again, they blew Those coals, which did the fires renew, They did the Nations re-ingage; The peoples vexed minds inrage, By fained showes, and false pretences, Abusing tender consciences. The course, by them, at first, begun Is, to this day, continued on: And, therefore, take this Truth from me, For, you shall find it true to be: That, till you see these more estrang'd From what they were; their posture chang'd; Yea, till they better their condition; Confine themselves to their Commission; Leave off to jangle, fool, and fiddle With what they shuold not intermeddle; And, be as pious, and as wise As they are outwardly precise; (And, as those few among them are, For whose sakes God abates the war) Nor King, nor Peers, nor Commons neither, Nor these united altogether, Shall able be that Peace to make Which their contentions will not shake. Make one inquirie more, to see, And search, what most of these men be, On whose endeavours you depend To bring your troubles to an end. Mark, how their Duties they attend In private, how their time they spend: VVhat company they most frequent; VVhat matters give them best content; VVhat conscience of their debts they make; What wrongs they do; what bribes they take; What by their neighbours they were thought Til they obtained what they sought; And, to what purpose they employ, The power, and places, they enjoy. Then cast an eye upon the Rabble; And, taking view (if you be able) Of all together, great and small, Mark well the Tantamount of all. Mark, if we be not like an Hoast That's routed when the battell's lost; And, if we deale not gifts, and blowes, Like madmen, both to friends and foes: Mark, how those hypocrites, that here Promoters of the truth appeare, VValk in their masking-suits abroad, As if they thought, to cozen God, As they do men. Mark too, that crew, VVhich is prophane in open view, How boldly, and how daringly (Ev'n when Gods thunderbolts do fly) They do offend; and, whether we May not to those, compared be, VVho, sawing are those planks asunder, VVhereon they stand, when Hell is under. VVhen these inquiries you have made, To see what light may thence be had; And when you know, as well as I, Those hindrances, and reasons, why That VOICE of Peace, yet goes not on, VVhich this time twelve moneth was begun; And, shall observe, with due regard, VVhat hath been formerly declar'd; I will disclose a great deal more, Then I have told you heretofore: But, not till then: yet, least you may Despaire, or faint, before that day; I will deliver, ere I go, A comfortable word or two. There may be PEACE, ere long, though yet We nor know how, nor merit it: For, GOD oft shewes great mercies, where The greatest of all sinners are; And if self-seekers be descri'd, Before this Isle they more divide; If Factions, VVrongs, and Discontent Indanger not this Parliament; And, if the Faithfull-Members can But cast out from them now and than A trouble-house: And, timely swage The vexed peoples rising rage; Offer, three more, such peace-oblations As that was of th'EXAMINATIONS; And out of Counties, Towns, and Cities, One Hecatombe of their Committees; And, by their prudence, worke it so, That honest men esteem'd may grow; That, Priest and People, down may lay Their works of stubble, and of hay, Their names, and terms, of SEPARATION, And meekly seeke the preservation Of TRUTH, in LOVE; if, in one yeare, Peace be not firmely setled here; My loanes, and losses, yet unpaid, (With my Arrears, three years delay'd) Ile forfeit wholly to the State; And, live still, as I've done of late, By swallowing wrongs, by empty Aire, And, patience, kept, through faith, and prayer Thus, to the Question made, you have That Answer, which our Prisoner gave; VVho, other Tales will tell, if He Much longer, shall imprison'd be. A Spaniel beaten, at your foot will lie: An English-Mastive, at your face will flie. Take this, and consider of it, till more comes. Carmen Expostulatorium: Or, A timely EXPOSTULATION VVith those both of The City of London, AND The present Armie, VVho have either endeavoured to ingage these Kingdoms in a Second Warre; or neglected the prevention thereof. Intended, for averting (if it may be possible) of that generall Destruction thereby threatened; and to that purpose, hastily (upon the immergent occasion) published. By Geo. VVither. Suffer fools gladly, seeing ye your selves are wise. 2 Cor. 11. 19. Though, I have spoken heretofore in vaine, And may do now; yet, I will speak againe, In hope, that what by Reason, nor by Rhyme, Could be effected, may be done by Time: And, that, although my words be lost to some, They shall not fruitlesse, unto all, become. Hark! how the Drums beat! how the Trumpets are Sounding Alarums to a second-warre, Before the first is done! and, whilst yet green The wounds upon our bodies may be seen! Behold, that, which was coming long ago, Drawes now so neer, that none shall need fore-show What next will follow; or, what will ensue On that: For, we, without a glasse, may view Such things in kenning, that unlesse our GOD, To them shall please to set a period; Or, make some such diversion, as no man Conjecture of, by any symptome, can, An universall Plague, on us will seize, Instead of Remedies, for our Disease. Why, then, shall I, in time of need, with-hold That, which my conscience tells me, should be told? Why should I keep those premonitions back, Which I conceive, my friends at this time lack? A poore-mans counsell, once, (as we heare say) Did save a City: So, perhaps, this may. Excuse me therefore, if (much grieved at Your rash proceedings) I expostulate, The sad condition, wherein, you to me, By this renewed warre, may seem to be. Renowned Citizens! what do you meane, To make your dwellings, that unhappie Scœne Whereon there shall, in probability, Be acted, now, the bloodiest Tragedie, That e're this Kingdome saw? Are you grown mad? And, is there no Physitian to be had For, this Distemp'rature? But, must it, here, Be Cuckow-moneth, or Dog-daies all the yeare? Have you no drugs, that may lost wits restore? Can Patience, Herbagrace, nor Hellebore, Nor any other Simple, or Confection, Work out that noysome humour and infection, (That hath besotted you) till you grow fit For Bedlam? where, are no such mad-men yet. Will nor Plaine-speakings, Parables, nor Charms, Make you regard, your safety, nor your harmes? But, that, as in despight of all that can Be threatned, or fore-told, by GOD, or man, You will resolved be to hurrie on, Till you beyond all remedies are gone? Are you distemper'd so, that nought can please, Save, what, still more increaseth your disease? Thinke you no Balme, or Salve, or Physick good, But, that which mortifies, or draweth blood, To your destruction? would you faine make void All your late hopes? would you see all destroy'd That, so much treasure; so much blood hath cost; And, let it, everlastingly, be lost, Your humour to fulfill; or, for a toy, Which, also, you perhaps, may nev'r enjoy? Nay, will you now for nothing? or, for worse, Will you to purchase mischief, and a curse To you, and to your children, re-ingage Into a war? and, by a bruitish rage, Expose those Freedomes to an over-throw, For, which your fathers did their lives bestow. To leave them unto you? And, which might be Confirm'd for ever, if you could agree Upon those principles of common-Reason, Whose violation is the highest Treason? Have you not yet discover'd who be they Who cheat you? nor whose game it is you play, By your divisions? And, when others find Your falshoods for you, will you still be blind; Or, wink, as carelesse of the things you heed, Till, by long winking, you grow blinde indeed? Discerne you not whose Kingdome is befriended, Whilst, GOD and CHRIST, are formally pretended? Nor whose designes, promoted are, the while Some, with faire shewes of piety, beguile Well-meaning men? And, carrie on their actions, By working with, and in, those differing factions Which they first raised? Marke you not, how, by, And in, that duplifi'd-capacity, Their Ingineers doe screw themselves into Most secrets on both sides? how, they undo (By meanes of that their unperceived gin) What, hath most privately contrived been? And, see you not, that thereby they doe bring What, e're the City, Parliament or King, Or any other party, doth propound, Advise or act, to give it selfe a wound, And further their particular designe, Till GOD prevents it by some countermine? Can you not yet discover (through their mist) Those juglings, which the spawne of Antichrist (False Priests, and lying Prophets) practise, now, To raise themselves, and work your overthrow? Nor, with what impudence they spread their lies, Their bitter jeerings, and their blasphemies, To make new breaches, or to widen those, Which Love, and Prudence, had begun to close? And, which ere this, quite closed might have been, Had not they cast untemper'd dirt between? Perceive you not, that, some of both your factions, Do labour an increase of your distractions, Because they seem not safe from questioning, For falshoods, to the Parliament, or King, Unlesse they shall endeavour to prevent The setling of that peacefull Government Which furthers justice? Yea, and see you not How, they conspire; how, they contrive, and plot To ruine all, in hope they may, by hap, Amidst the tumults, their just doomes escape? Or, by dispairing of a good conclusion, Bring all things, with themselves, into confusion? Is it a time your Quarrells to renew, When all is hazzarded, that's deare to you? Observe ye not, three Factions, like to them Which were the ruine of Jerusalem, At strife within your walls? Doe you not see, What spighfull sparklings in their eyes there bee? How sharply, they at one another whet Their slanderous tongues? how grinningly they set Their teeth against each other? And how they With pens dipt in black poyson, doe assay To re-ingage you; and, by cursed words, Provoke the re-unsheathing of your swords, That ev'ry sonne, and father, friend, and brother, May sheath it in the heart of one another? Are you besotted so, not to perceive Who hath befool'd you? who, the snares doe weave, That have intrap'd you? and who spic'd the Bowle Which makes you drunken, stagger, reel and rowle Into perdition? doth it not appeare, That, to prevent the mischiefs which you feare, You run a hazzard, to draw downe upon you A greater, then they ever could have done you, Whom you distrust? And, that, in hope to shun Uncertainties, to certaine deaths you run? Is GOD, now acting for you, and doth lurk Within a cloud, to hide from you his work? And, will you work against him, to destroy That preservation, which you might enjoy, By living to behold that saving-health, Which he was bringing to this Common-wealth? Have you concluded never to retire In your Career, till all is on a fire? And you, and yours, lie sprawling in the plashes Of your own blood? or, in your Cities ashes? Or, till you view this goodly spacious frame, (The work of many Ages) in a flame? Have you so often heard it said, from him, (Whose true presages, no man will contemn, But Reprobates) what miserable Fate Attends that House, that City, and that State, Which is divided? Have his Prophecies So often been fulfill'd before your eyes? And, are they, at this day, so likely, too, To be, ere long, fulfilled upon you; And, yet, will you a new-division run, As if you studied how to be undone? Or, as if you resolved on that path, Which to avoid, ev'n GOD fore-warn'd you hath? Have I my selfe, by GOD's permission, too, So often told you, what you would mis-do, What courses you would follow; what, reject? Fore-shown you plainly, what it would effect, If you did otherwise? Have you oft seen Those things fulfilled, which fore-told have been, And spoken of them? Nay, have you oft read, And descanted on that which I have said, And jeered my predictions? yet, will you In ev'ry circumstance fulfill them now? Shall I be made (as me in scorn you call) A Prophet, as it were, in spight of all Which I fore-shewed you, with an intent, That you might take occasion to prevent What was fore-told; and make my true predictions, By penitencie, to appear but fictions? Have you crack'd all my Almonds? And (instead Of making them a meanes of taking heed What course you steer'd) so acted, as if you, From them, had tooke occasion to pursue Forbidden paths? that, future times may know GOD'S providence was pleased to fore-show What would be done by men impenitent, Though warnings doe precede their punishment? But, let that passe, which cannot be undone; And, to prevent, what you, as yet, may shun, Let me upon the credit gotten from Things past, finde means from perills yet to come, Your City to preserve; and, let me lose Or thrive, as I to you shall things propose To be consider'd on, without designe, For any private, or base end of mine; Or to contribute strength to any Faction, Or, weaken anie Party now in action, But as relating to the preservation Of this indanger'd City, State, or Nation. Have you consider'd rightly of the cause Which on your City, this ingagement drawes? And rightly weigh'd it, with all circumstances Thereto belonging; and what 'tis advances Your quarrell to this height? or how you find Those Leaders, by their principles inclin'd, Whose prudence you depend on? do you know How dim the sight of wisest men may grow By private interest, or by respect, To those men whom they malice, or affect, Or to opinions? If not, have a care How you ingage: especially if warre Be like to follow. For, we daily see By those discourses which divulged bee By disagreeing parties; that, when they Each others writings happen to survey, At ev'rie page they seem to take offence, And judge it void of learning, truth, or sense; When he that is as wise, and in his waies Unbiassed, peruseth it with praise. Have you consider'd, seriously, how strong Your foes may prove? how chargeable, how long This warre may be? who, shall the cost defray? How willingly the Citizens will pay That ayd which you may need, when they are made Unable by a long decay of trade? Yea, when so many thousands want their bread, Who were by constant labour daily fed, And, shall consume their lives, or strength away, By watchings, and hard dutie, night and day? Have you well-weighed, for how long a space Provisions may be stopped from this place? How greatly, Famine may increase your charge? How, want, and nastinesse, may then inlarge The Pestilence begun? how much, the three Dissenting Parties, which among you bee, Your troubles may augment? Or, doe you know, When you advanced are, to meet a foe Without your walls, what mischiefs may begin By meanes of some, whom you must leave within? Especially, when poverty extreme, Revenge, or avarice, hath tempted them, By unexpected opportunities, To act things for their own advantages? Are you, in these particulars, assured, To bee, at each extremitie, secured? Have you conceiv'd, how truly miserable You shall be rendred, if you prove unable To over-come? And, though you victors be, How little comfort thereof you may see When you have summed up, what you shall lose? And (by removing them) what other foes, You may make way for, to the consumation Of all the strength, and glorie, of this Nation? Yet, once againe, look downe into that hell, Wherein you are preparing now to dwell: Can you suppose, that all, whom you intend To arme, your Cause, and City, to befriend, Will act as you expect? Or, think you, they Can do, as much for you, as they can say? Can you, by any caution, be assured, Your goods and families will bee secured From your owne Party? Or, your persons free From outrage, when, among you, there shall be A generall confusion, and their need? And yours, shall daily new distractions breed? Which ev'rie day, and week, will still grow greater, Till your afflictions have advis'd you better? Can you beleeve, that all your power and wit, (Which make small shew of such effects, as yet) Shall able be, by force, or, gentle waies, To conjure downe the spirits you may raise? Or, draw a circle, or provide a charme So strong, that none of them shall do you harme? Have you some works, which fain you would have done, For your owne ends? and, thinke you, they have none? Or, that, they who did sleight a greater power, Will conscience make of trampling upon your? Or (if provok'd) of treading on you, too, When they dislike of anie thing you do? Can you conceive, that though you armed were Against all those whom you abroad may feare; That, in your streets, your houses, (nay, within Your chambers) there will not (as there hath been) A Party be, which will assay to make Your hopes abortive, if this course you take? Yea, multiply your sorrowes, till th'event Grow desperate? Or, you too late repent; And, shall be over-whelmed with disorders, Fears, out-cries, violences, flames, and murthers? Do you believe, those listed Reformadoes, Who puffe you up with vauntings and bravadoes? (Mistake me not; I purpose no disgrace To all (who now abiding in this place, Are cast out of imploiment) do you think, Those, who are most couragious in their drink? Those, of the roaring Frenchified-Rout, With untruss'd breeches, with shirts hanging out, And Codpeeces beribanded about With partie-colour'd Inkle? Or, that those Apprentices, who late in tumults rose, And, without check (to your perpetuall shame) To force th'unguarded Senate, rudelie came, (And foamed raging furie at their doore, Like billowes beating on the patient shore) Think you, that such as these ordain'd have been To save you from the feares that you were in? To be Deliverers, do you believe These likey? or, are those, who to receive New entertainment (and perhaps old pay) Have onely aim'd at, such like men as may Be so reli'd upon; as, to ingage Your Citie now, a second warre to wage? If so; Oh! be more cautious, be more sage. Oh, where! where now, is all that piety, That prudence, and that Christian charity, Which you pretended to? where is that care Of publike safetie which did once appeare? Where is that conscience of the preservation Of your owne families from desolation, Which doth or should in ev'rie Christian dwell, That is not far below an Infidell? Oh! be not wilfull in the prosecution Of an unfit and frantick resolution, Which, doubtlesse, by the malice of the Devill (And by his instruments) is now for evill Instill'd into you; that, he might make void Those hopes, which we, e're this time, had enjoi'd, If want of faith, and love, to one another, Indanger'd not our perishing together. Be, therefore, well advis'd, what will ensue, Before this cursed warre you do renew? Be not deluded, or provok'd by those Who care not how your Citie they expose To hardship, and to hazzard: For, it may Indanger all; if I know what I say. Invite you not, from ev'rie quarter, hither Those plagues, and those confusions, altogether, Of which most places now have had a tast; Lest, all the storm descend on you at last; And you constrained be to swallow up The verie dregs of their most bitter cup, As you by Riddles, intimation had; Though you of them, but small accompt have made; And, as all use to doe, whose sins are ripe, And, take no warnings, till they feel the stripe. Regard not, what your flatterers pretend, But, rather, hearken to your faithfull friend, Who plainly doth fore-see, the sad effects, To which your course intended, now directs. Be, yet, perswaded, your own selves to pity; Your friends, your little ones, your wives, your City; And do not unadvisedly fulfill Your foes designes; by your perverted will: What is't to me, what course you pitch upon, Who to the world-ward wholly am undone, And ruined alreadie, by neglects, Of justice, on th'one side; and by th'effects Of war, on t'other? and, whose cheef wealth lies In those things, which the world doth most despise? And which (I hope) till I my life shall finish, Nor peace nor war, nor ought els, shall diminish? What have I got? or what can I obtaine By seeking thus, your madnesse to restraine, But their displeasure, who delight in war? And, my despightfull foes, alreadie are? The profit will be yours; And, this alone My recompence will be, that I have done My dutie, in perswading you unto That, which my heart believes, you ought to do. Contemn not, therefore, what I now advise, Though I may seem despised, in their eyes, Who counsell otherwise. Seek to be quiet; And, add this short receipt unto your diet: To qualifie your selfe-destroying-rage, Take, Time, Rue, Patience; and as much of Sage As may be needfull: Then, mix speedily All these ingredients, and, them so apply As you have oft been taught; So, GOD shall cure Or qualifie this English-Calenture; Which is, an Epidemicall disease, That, on this nation, every where doth seize, As did the Sweating Sicknesse: If we may Confide, in what Chronologers do say. Why will ye perish and indanger all Your neighbours; and, three Kingdomes by your fall, Since you may shun it, and be safe and blessed? A refuge, to the needie, and oppressed? What moveth you, that, to escape a feare, You flie into a mischiefe, or a snare? What is it makes you feare, where no feare is, And, fearelesse of true dangers, but, ev'n this, That, neither of GOD'S threats, you awefull grow: Nor love your neighbour, as you ought to doe? Some of you, have, it seems, a thirst for blood, And, peradventure, for that reason, GOD Will give them blood to drink. Their heart is far From peace; and, he will come to them, in war. The sons of Consolation have been scorned; And, therefore, he his Messengers hath turned To sons of thunder, who, as they desire, Will speake to them in Sulphure and in Fire. A Spirit of detraction, and of lying, On paper-wings, among you hath been flying, Till, as it seems, GOD hath, for that offence, Expos'd you to a reprobated sense, Believing lies; and, to an Appetite Bewitched with a gluttonous delight In blasphemies, and falshoods; which are vented For every mornings breakfast, newly minted: And, that grosse diet, hath begot in you Those evill humours, which distemper, now, Your Bodie-Politike; and makes your Peace Disrelish, by a loathsome nauseousnesse. You may, perchance, believe, by their delusions, Who have abus'd your trust, to your confusions, And their own shame; that, you your selves are banding, For Christ his Kingdome: And, arm, for withstanding Of his opposers: But, take heed, I pray, Lest you prove, rather, to be such as they, Who, think they do GOD service, when they spill The blood of those, who seek to do his will. I will, and must acknowledge, that in you There is a zeale: But, this is also true, That, most of you have not obtained, yet, That knowledge, which true Zealots doth befit. Religious, I confesse, you are; and, so, The Jewes were too, when GOD did overthrow Their greatest City; yea, they never seem'd So worthily devout to be esteem'd, (According to their Law) yet, then GOD shook Their whole foundation, and quite from them took That Law, and place, for which they did not spare Their lives, nor ought, which unto them was dear. Yea, through that means, by which they would prevent That losse, they lost it: Ev'n when innocent, And guiltlesse blood they spilt: And, they who run Their course, will doubtlesse fare as they have done. Your selves therefore delude not, with bare showes Of sanctitie; but seriously dispose Your minds to charity, that Christian peace May setled be; and bruitish discord cease. For, all your pious, and your morall works Are nothing better, then are those of Turks, Or Pagans, till a will renew'd doth move To action, by a principle of love. You preach; but, preach ye Christ, with lesse contention, And, that shall be of strife a good prevention: You write; but, put lesse gall into your ink; And, let not your expressions tast, and stink Of bitter slanders, to the provocation Of vengeance, and of furious indignation: For, when from us unseemingly speeches flow, Although our cause be right, we are not so. You fast: But, if you fast not more from strife, Oppression, pride, and from a wicked life; Your fastings, never will procure your peace, But, rather, your confusions more increase. You pray: But, pray as Phineas did; and wee Shall better fruits of your long-prayer see. You list your selves, the Army to resist: But, to be reconcil'd, have better list Then you have had: And, seek, and follow more The likely way of peace, then heretofore. For, you may conquer more with loving words, Then with your pistolls, and your naked swords: And, you shall get more profit and more praise, Then by those Forces you intend to raise: And, thousands, who would dying, curse your rage, Shall live, and blesse you, in another age. What makes you, and our Army now to bee, So jealous of each other as, we see, But, ev'n selfe-love and pride, which you, and they Pursue in others? Or, because each day You more and more, in manners grow like them, Whose guiltinesse you raile at, and condemn? For, most of those, who in these times pretend To Reformation, do but seem to mend Their neighbours faults, that, they, thereby, to make Themselves, and Fortunes, may occasion take; Yea, zealouslie they labour to remove And punish Tyrants: But, it may from love, And not from hate of Tyrannie arise, That, they remove those men who tyrannize. For, it is done, perhaps, that in the roome Of Tyrants, they, like Tyrants may become; Else 'twere not possible, that we should see Suppressed Tyrants, ev'rie day to be Out-vi'd by their Successors; and out-gone By those, who blamed most, what they have done. 'Tis not, because you seek the publike good, That you renew this War: For, letting-blood, (Especially, now when the Dog-starre reignes) So neare the heart, and in those master-veines, Now likely to be op'ned, seemes, to me, Not Physicke, but, true butcherie, to be. 'Tis not for GOD, that you do now promove This Quarrell: For, you know, that GOD is Love; And, when he doth ingage you in a warre, It alwaies evidently doth appeare, How it conduceth to the preservation Of amity, and union, in a Nation; And that we cannot otherwise avoid The having of those Freedomes quite destroid, By which we should conserve it: But, in this Your quarrell, no such thing apparent is. 'Tis not, because one Party doth incline Unto a differing forme of Discipline, Which t'other side dislikes, from whence arose This Quarrell, (though from thence it partly flowes:) For, prudence, wheresoever love remaines, In any measure, tempers or restraines From all extremes; as you by those may see, Who moderate in either Partie bee, And firm to principles, which do preserve The essence of our Faith: And, they observe That your contentions, rather, do arise From fleshly lusts, and carnall vanities, Then from that zeale pretended; and, there's none Will doubt it, if you wilfullie go on In bloud-shed; and, indeavour not for grace, To make your fury, give discretion place. 'Tis not the failings, or the imperfections Of your opinions, but, of your affections, Which heightens discords; and a will to please Back-sliding Demas, and Diotrophes, Which hath surpriz'd you. 'Tis a disregard Of Justice, in chastisements, and reward, And, that respect of persons, which each side Is guilty of; if both bee not beli'd. For, if by simptomes, I the truth may gather, The City, and the Army too, had rather Adventure their safe being (by deniall Of yeelding up their minions to triall) Then to permit, that Justice shall proceed Impartially. Both are, it seems, agreed, What ever their well-willers do propose, To save their Malefactors, though they lose Themselves, and all their Tribe, (as, for that crime, The Benjamites once did, in former time) And (which more aggravates) ev'n thus they do, Though they haue seen the King, for doing so, Set halfe beside his Throne; And, though they see This Parliament, indangered to bee, Ev'n for the selfe-same fault: So hard a thing, It is, ev'n for the best of men, to bring Their wills, and their affections, to submit To justice, though they cannot fly from it. But, they will still be trying to avoid Her just injunctions, till they bee destroi'd, And hence, hence, chieflie floweth all those factions, Those mischiefs, discords, and all those distractions, That are among us; And, he that assayes To shew them the disorder of their wayes, (And their unsafenesse) though with no intent, But, their, and your destruction, to prevent: Or, when he minds them of it, though he spares Their persons; And the matter so prepares, By couching it in generalls, that they Who are to blame, correct their errours may, Without disgrace; yet, they return him still, Unkindnesses (at least) for his good will; Deprive him, of his freedome, or estate; Eclipse his credit, or his person hate; Or, at the best, regard what he hath spoke, No more then doth a Statue, or a block. And, ten to one, when some of those doe hear These motives unto peace; they, will go near To question it before Authoritie, As if I had enfeebled much thereby, The peoples hands. The Jewes, to this effect, In such a case, did spightfully object Against the life of Ieremie; but, he Who sav'd him then, will do the like for mee. Oh! let the Citie; Let our Army too, Consider wisely, what they have to do; And, that, among the best, are imperfections Which call to us, for brotherly affections To cover them; and, helps, to cure them, rather, Then Instruments to seek, or, Armes to gather To spoile each other. 'Tis our Ignorances And want of love and meeknesse which advances Our spleenes against our brethren. We so long Have, at each other, bitter-speakings flung, And shot the Arrowes of reviling words; That, they provoke us, to unsheath our swords, And, execute; before it doth appeare Which partie is to blame; and which is cleare: Or, whether any cause may be perceived, Why both (though guilty) may not be reprieved. Their party, or their single interest Doth, oft, so biasse men from what is best For them to practise: And, vain policy In outward seeming, doth appeare so nigh To blamelesse prudence; that it drawes them on To thinke injustice warrantably done: Or, that, (at least) it warrants them to think, They, at injustice, in their own, may wink: Especially, if they conceive, it may From anie good designe, take strength away. And this false principle, and wrong proceed, Made thereupon, much injurie doth breed. This makes, the Presbyterian-Party mad, That, anie of their side, though nev'r so bad, Should question'd be. This, also blinds them so From seeing what it doth invite them to, That it hath rend'red them much willinger To hazzard all by a renewing-war, Then, leave them to that triall, which perchance Would cleare them; And their innocence advance. This maketh manie, on the other side, As partiall, and unable to abide That, their partakers, should with ought be charged: Whereas, had their impeachments been inlarged With such of their own party, who, by fame Proclaimed are, to be no lesse to blame, Then some accused; And, of whose offence, They might have got as good intelligence; It had prevented all those jealousies, Which from their seeming partialities, Have lately sprung; and, which will be removed, When they, who so advised, have improved Their counsell into practise; As e're this It had been done; but, that, you know there is A Remora in most things; and, that some To all good motions, opposites become. Had they (as I presume they mean to do) Cast resolutely off, all leaning to That, which their party doth denominate, And, only sought the setling of the State, According to the Lawes; and how to bring An Union 'twixt the people and the King, By bringing all, indifferently to bide Th'impartiall Test, by which they should be tri'd; It had, before this day, a period set, To our chiefe troubles. And, this peace is, yet, But, for a time, deferr'd; unlesse you marre That future blessing, by a present warre. Demur, therefore, a while, e're you pursue Those thoughts or actions, which your hearts may rue. Doe not false courage from those vap'rings take, Or, those high-flying vaunts, which they do make, Who would engage you; though, with fair pretence To reason, justice; and with confidence, They would beguile you. For, no men appear More arrogant, more bold, or lesse to fear Then they, whom GOD infatuates, rejects, And giveth over unto those effects, Which their owne wit to put in action chose, As in despight of what he doth propose. Let not those foolish, fruitlesse, policies, (Those impudent and those truth-seeming lies) Which they on all occasions do invent, As their most usefull gin and instrument To worke their ends; Let not these draw you to Their course, from that, wherein you ought to go: For, they do but delude you. When ye heare That, they give out, the Counties will appeare To be your aid; believe it not, till you Perceive them coming: For, they do not know Your Quarrell; neither why you should oppose Your most deserving Friends, as greatest Foes. When you shall heare them, for the King pretend, That, they may draw his party, to befriend Their new designe. Or, when they cry, The King! The King! The King! with promises to bring His person hither; and make shew to settle Your peace by him: Believe them, but a little, For, they who so pretend, do neither dare To bring him hither; neither able are. And, though they were; The King so well descries Where, his best play, and chief advantage, lies; What, with his principles, may best agree? Why, they, who would not have him, willing bee To have him now: Yea, so to him 'tis known, Who for the publike ends; who, for their own, Restrain him, or inlarge him; whom to trust; Who, firm, or fickle were; who false, or just, Either to him, or others; And, hath made So many proofs, of things whereof he had No triall heretofore; that, well I know, His bought experience will permit him, now, To trust to none but them, whose honestie Is their chief honour, and best policie: And, when GOD hath inclin'd him, so to do; He shall trust us, and we shall trust him too. That, this Conjunction may not be prevented, Let that, which you determine, be repented. Quench, ere too late, the fire which is begun; And, lest, to be unquenchable it run, Remove the fewell; powre upon the flame True penitentiall teares; And, grow more tame, More wise, more charitable, yea, more meek; And, in GOD'S grace, your peace and safetie seek: Which, cannot be expected, whilst with them, You are at variance, who are dear to him; Or, whilst you those resist, whom he doth call To do his work; although, perhaps, they shall Not do it for his sake, as they pretend; But, for their owne, and some unworthy end. By, generally, shutting up your shops, Make not a sad obstruction, in the hopes Of your subsistance; which, will over-soone Consumed be, though that were left undone: For, by this Stratagem, your Politicians, Will but accelerate their own perditions, By heightning of their furie, who thereby, Shall feele the gripes of helplesse povertie: Use, rather, what good meanes your wits afford As well to keep off hunger, as the sword; That, you may have a being, till GOD please To consummate the cure of this disease. Take heed, what those good Priests, and Prophets say, Who preach to you, a charitable way, Unto your peace; And, do not be beguil'd By those, who counsell to divide the Child; But, trust unto his wisdome, and his doome From whom, the sentence, on your wayes, must come: And if you needs will armed be, put on (As you ought, long ere this time, to have done) The Christians compleat Armes. For, then, if you Shall be destroyed, so, will I be too. If, for the publike-weal, that Host appeare, Of whose intents, you seeme to stand in fear; You have no cause of dread. If, they conceale A private ayme, beneath a publike zeale; Or vaile their pride, their Avarice, or hate, With Godlinesse, or service to the State; If they shall seek, one faction to suppresse; Indulge the wicked, or the wickednesse Of their owne partie; And, proceed, as tho God would not heed, what they unjustly do; Then, God himselfe against them shall appeare; And, for your Cities guard, a standard reare: A buckler he shall weild, and interpose 'Twixt you, and them, to ward away their blowes: Then, he shall save you from their crueltie, And, be aveng'd on their hypocrisie, Without your guilt: And, crumble them, till they, With all their hopes, and glories, fume away; As theirs have done, who out of grace were thrust, In former times, for their abused trust. And, this will be, successively, the doome, That shall on all our false Reformers come, Till all such perish; and, till such appear, As, neither will, for profit, love, or feare, Corrupted be. If, for sinister ends, You false have plaid, with your wel-meaning Friends: If, you, to gain advantages, have straid From due performing ought, which you have said: If, out of wilfulnesse, or, out of pride, And haughtinesse of minde, you thus provide To give them battell; GOD will finde it out, And punish, till amendment he hath wrought. Yea, both of you, if both of you shall be Alike perverse, alike reward will he. But, hark! a strong Alarum I doe heare, The Army, you so dread, is drawing neare, And, will not long be hence; I will therefore (Before the Drums beat, and the Cannons roare Too loud for them to heare me) now direct Some words to them, in hope of good effect: For, thousands of them know me: and, perchance, It may more profit you, then an advance With all your force against them. Howsoever; Ile try, how GOD will prosper my endeavour. Friends of that honour'd Army, by whom, we Have had assistance; and, yet hope to see This War concluded; me with patience heare. And, to that end, a little while forbeare To prosecute that worke, which may be done Yet soon enough. And, oh! I feare, too soone. I come with no defiance; nor to bring A charge against you, touching any thing Wherein you may be censur'd to abuse Your power or trust: For, thereof to accuse, I neither have Commission, nor intent: Nor knowledge, have I, were I thereto bent, Of the determinations, or the waies Which you pursue; save, as that Rumour sayes, Whose contradictions, do so much condemn Her owne Relations, that, I trust not them. Nor do I blame you, though it be confest In your expresses, that you have transgrest The bounds of Common-Order, in some things: Because, to me experience, knowledge, brings Of that Necessity, which lawfull makes What Law forbids: And, that when self-will takes A lawlesse Liberty, which may disable To save the publike, by meanes warrantable, In ordinarie course; the SUMMUM JUS Of humane nature, then, intitles us, Unto a rightfull freedome, to dispense With anie humane Law, in our defence. Because, our preservation, is that end, Whereto all Lawes do principally tend. Now, whether you necessitated were To such a course, you more concerned are In weighing it then I; and, better know Upon what grounds you have conceived so. I know that such necessities may be; I know, that they, who feel them, best can see, How great they are: I, likewise know, that they And their adherents, who the tyrants play, Have seldome such necessities confest, To light on any, till they were opprest Beyond repaire; And, therefore, leaving, now, This matter to be scan'd, alone, by you, And your own consciences; I will present What, I think, future mischiefs may prevent. If, therefore, now, among you, any be Who need it, take this brief advice of me. If you come armed, not for war, but peace, And, look, that GOD should your proceedings blesse; Remember those main principles, whereon You seem to ground, what hath, by you, been done. GOD's glory, publike safety, and the Lawes, With your just liberty, were all the cause Of your engaging; and, therefore take heed, That, you for no designement, now, proceed, Of private consequence, least you destroy The hope of that, which you might els enjoy. Let, in your sight, your brethrens blood be deare; Let not the riches of this place, appeare A prize, to draw, or tempt you, further then Becometh just, and bravely-minded men. To this renowned City, wherein you Have many Friends, a true compassion show, Though she provok'd you; know, that nobler, far, Are Saviours, then an Executioner. Let Justice have due course, though hand she lay Upon your Darlings: For, one Achan may Indanger your whole Camp; and you have seen How plagued, for Injustice, wee have been. From needlesse violence, with-hold your hands, Let moderation be in your demands; That, by your actions, they, whose Papers flie, To your dishonour, may receive the lie. To utter now unto you, I have more, Yea, many things materiall, yet, in store. But, whil'st this line is writing, I am told, Our Line is enter'd, and our Southerne-Hold. And, therefore, here I pawse— These words are vain; and, all, that we can do, Except, GOD adds his blessing thereunto. “O LORD! thou great Peace-maker, therfore say “Amen to that, for which I now shall pray. “Out of our present dangers, safety bring; “Out of our darknesse, let thy true light spring; “Peace, out of these our warres; love, out of hate; “Out of disorders, a well-setled State. “Let People, City, King, and Parliament, “And, all dissenting-parties, now, assent, “And, so, unite; that, none may them divide: “Make us well-principled; and, so, abide. “Make us sincerely practise, and professe “A single-Truth, in simple-Righteousnesse. “Yea, now, when all the Powers within this Land, “Are in confusion, and amazed stand, “Affrighted by each other; now, when sin “Is like to hazzard all; do thou begin “To work alone; and, raise, thou, out of that, “A Change, which all the Land shall wonder at. “And, if my own corruptions be not, yet, “Too many, such a blessing to permit, “Minde me in mercy too; And, minde me, so, “That, they, who have oppressed me, may know, “I am a Servant, who, to thee, is deare; “What ever, to the world, I may appeare: “And, hasten that Deliverance, O LORD! “Which thy compassion shall to me afford: “For, in my sufferings, I am left alone; “And, friend, or hope, but thee, LORD! I have none. Fiat voluntas Dei. AMYGDALA BRITANNICA, Almonds for Parrets. A Dish of Stone-Fruit, partly shel'd and partly unshel'd; WHICH (If crack'd, pick'd, and well digested) May be wholsome against those Epidemick Distempers of the Brain, now predominant; and prevent some Malignant Diseases, likely to ensue. Composed, heretofore, by a well-knowne Moderne Author; and, now published according, to a Copie, found written with his own Hand. Qui bene latuit, bene vixit. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing, see not: and hearing, they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is fulfilled the Prophesie of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand: and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive. For this peoples heart is waxed grosse, and their eares are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their eares, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and healed. MATTH. XIII. XIII, XIV, XV. When Wisemen found plain-dealing did offend, In Hieroglyphicks they their Musings pen'd; And, to the meek, conveighed in a cloud, The light, which was disdained by the proud: That, so, the scorner, hearing, might not heare, Nor seeing, see, what plainly doth appeare: For, just it is, that they should lose their sight, Who would not see their safety, when they might. 'Tis much observed, that this Generation Hath taken up the Parrets inclination, Who loves, on shells, to exercise his beake, And, words not understood, delights to speake: Wee, therefore, (since the labour may be spar'd) For private entertainment, have prepar'd This dish of Stone-fruits; whereof, there are some, That yeeld a kernell, better then the plumb; And, such, that, if they well digested bee, Will cleare their eyes, who have a mind to see. Here, till affaires are wholly mis-transpos'd, You shall perceive, in Parables, disclos'd, Upon what actions, and contingencies, The Fortune of this British Empire lies; And, by what symptomes, you may truly know, Which way the Publike Fate will ebb, or flow. Thus he conceives, who seriously hath weigh'd Those things; &amp; in these words his thoughts arai'd. All things terrestriall have their dates, Kings, Kingdoms, and the greatest States; And, warnings do appeare, to some, Of all such changes, ere they come; Whereby, were timely means assaid, Plagues might be scaped, or allaid: And, peradventure, to that use, This, which ensueth, may conduce. The time drawes neere, and hasteth on, In which strange works will be begun; And, prosecutions, whereon shall Depend much future blisse, or bale. If, to the left-hand, you decline, Assur'd destruction they divine; But, if the right-hand course ye take, This Island it will happy make. A time drawes near, in which you may, As you shall please, the Chesse-men play: Remove, confine, check, leave, or take, Dispose, depose, undoe, or make, Pawne, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, or King, And, act your wills in every thing: But, if that time let slip you shall, For yesterday, in vaine you call. A time drawes near, in which the Sun Will give more light, then he hath done: Then, also, you shall see the Moon Shine brighter then the Sun at noon: And, many Stars, now seeming dull, Give shadowes, like the Moon at full. Yet, then, shall some, who think they see, Wrapt in Egyptian darknesse be. A time drawes near, when, with your blood, You shall preserve the Vipers brood, And starve your own; yet, fancy, than, That, you have plaid the Pelican: But, when you think, the frozen Snakes Have chang'd their natures, for your sakes, They, in requitall, will contrive Your mischief, who did them revive. A time will come, when, they that wake, Shall dreame; and sleepers undertake The grand-Affaires: yet, few men know, Which are the Dreamers of these two; And, fewer care, by which of these They guided be, so they have ease: But, an Alarum shall advance Your drowzie spirits, from that trance. A time shall come, ere long, in which Meer Beggars shall grow soonest rich; The rich with wants be pinched more, Then such as go from door to doore; The honourable by the base Shall be despighted, to their face; The truth defamed be with lies; The foole preferr'd before the wise; And he that fighteh to be free, By conquering, inslav'd shall be. A Time shall come, when they that would Discredit truths, which were foretold, Of ev'ry newes will stand in feare, And, credit ev'ry lie they heare; Till they, by penance done, have paid For ev'ry truth they have gainsaid. Then, they who have expected Fish, Shall finde a Scorpion in their dish: The children shall have stones for bread, And, starved be, whilst dogs are fed: Then also shall each work you do, Ere it be finish'd, make you two; And, render all, when much is done, Far worse, then when the Plague begun. A time drawes neere, in which your peace Shall make your quarrells more increase: Then shall you by false-brethren lose More, then by all your open-foes: Then, one-mans hate shall rob of more Then five times twenty can restore: Three men shall act more mischiefs here, Then three great Kingdoms well can beare: And then shall they be better priz'd, Whose counsells have been long despis'd. The time is drawing near, when wee Our own Antipodes shall bee: When our most dangerous disease Shall be the Scribes and Pharises: When Seamen shall usurp the whip; Plowmen presume to guide the ship; The Children frequently begin, To teach their grandams how to spin: And, then shall that, which was a crime, Be deem'd the vertue of the time; And, that, impietie be thought, Which hath, for sanctitie, been taught. A time will come, in which the Flocks, Shall see their Shepheard play the Fox, And range and ramble up and downe, Till he into a wolf be growne; Then, they that hounds and sleugh-dogs keep, Shall hunt him, till he growes a Sheep; And, then, if what he seemes, he be He shall be safe; and, so, shall we. A time will come, when see you shall Toads fly aloft, and Eagles crawle; Wolves walke abroad in humane shapes; Men, turne to asses, hogs, and apes: But, when that cursed time is come, Well's he that is both deafe, and dumbe; That nothing speaketh, nothing heares, And, neither hopes, desires, nor feares. The time will come when you shall see A Headlesse-body active bee, And, many actions full of dread, Performed by a Trunklesse-head; Which Head, and Body, being brought To knit together, as they ought, Might prove to be, in time to come, The joy, and awe, of Christendome. But, e're such happie daies be seen, There will some changes intervene Our hopes and them, to make or marre the sequele, as they mannag'd are; And, therefore, that discerne you may When these approach; and, which are they; And, what to do, when they are knowne, Here, they in easie types are showne; Or, by those tokens, which fore-hint, What you should labour to prevent. When, you see many things effected, Which were nor feared nor suspected; The Mountains sink, the Valleyes clime; Stars rise, and set, before their time; Grosse Meteors, from the mud exhald, To highest Spheres, and Planets call'd; And, utter darknesse termed light; Then, bid your happy daies, good night. When, you embrewed, in their blood, Behold three Lions of one brood; If, then, a fourth shall interpose, It will but more increase their woes; Till but one head, possesse they shall, And, but one heart, among them all. Which, whosoe're to passe can bring, Shall be the darling of a King. His prickles, when the Thistle showes, Within the borders of the Rose, If, with the Flower-de-Luce it close, Designing what the Orange does, The stile of blessed it shall lose; Yea, cursed be, where e're it growes; And, by such faithlesnesse, expose It selfe, and others, to their Foes. But, being, only, for a time, (To cure the Feavers of that Clyme) Transplanted South-ward; if it spread, And root, no further then the bed, Where, by the Gardner, it was set, To cure us of our Ague-fit; It, of our Garden, shall be free, And, call'd the blessed-Thistle be. When Charles his waine, begins to reel, And, retrograde shall seem to wheel; If, rambling forth, the Driver be. Without his Orb, but one degree; What hope soe're he hath of help, From Lionesse, or Lions-whelp, Twill be a hundred unto one, If he return, when he is gone. When from one hand, let slip, you view Two Dogs, one Leopard to pursue; Though ev'ry passage you beset, And ride, and run untill you sweat, The Game will at the last get free, If Patch, one of your Gray-hounds be; Or, if you think, to take the beast, By Huntsmen, who are such profest. When Britaines Gerion you shall see, With Single head, on bodies three, Put forth his face, in a disguize, (Undecently betwixt his thighes) Be warie then, and take great heed, In your affaires, how yee proceed; Least, you be laid in little ease, Betwixt the French and Kings disease. When frequently, observe you shall, S. Peter rob'd, to pay S. Paul; When Butterflies, Silk-wormes out-brave; When Maggots waste, what Ants did save, And, wasps, and drones, and hornets drive Your Bees, to seek a Forraign-hive; Then, fly to providence divine, And, do, as that shall you incline. When, you see breaking stones, and glasses, For zeale in true Religion passes: Aswell the Clergie, as the Lay, Learne, how at fast, and loose, to play: Hermaphrodites begot with child; Herod, and Pilate, reconcil'd: The Moralist, his light abuse; And, Christians, turning Semi-Jewes; You may, where e're you go, or ride, Have Ignis fatuus, for your guide. When, in this Isle observe you shall The tenth part of great Babel fall, And, Reformation, fully made Of them, and their mysterious trade, Who merchandize most holy things; Then GOD to speedy vengeance brings, With Gog, with Magog, and the Whore, The Beast, which Nations, yet, adore. When you perceive the Common-Creed, Renounc'd; and, whimseyes in it steed; The words, which our chiefe Rabbi taught, Despis'd, or out of practice brought; And, some abuse the God-head, more Then all the Gentiles heretofore; They, who his nature do mistake, Shall then grow like the God they make; And, think it, when they do oppresse, But sanctity, and righteousnesse. When, they, that are of Babel shie, Shall further into Babell flie; When, they, who Superstition shun, To greater Superstitions run, And, to escape prophanenesse, shall Into meer Atheisme fall; Then, will, at full, those plagues appeare, Which, now, are but beginning, here; And, they, who live those daies to know, Will thinke of him, who told you so. When, in this Isle, the people sees A confus'd heptarchie of Pees, Their peace, disturbing, by distraction; Their power, become a three-square faction Of equall sides, and, each inclin'd To what, it fancy hath design'd; And, few regarding Common-good: Then, shall the Moon be turn'd to blood, Unlesse, you can by Chymistrie, The Sulphure, Salt, and Mercurie So temper; that produce it shall The true Elixar from them all. When, loud the British waters roare, And, flow up to the Senate doore; If, then, the wind shall also blow, To make their swellings higher grow: Then whether you to them give way, Or, seek to stop them, by a bay, In vain, to curb them, strive you shall, Without the Balsome-box, and scale; Though you diversions make (in hope To do it) and, cast Mountaines up. When, you observe the Civil-sword, Usurp the power of the word; And, (where declining Babel stood) Men, laying Sions walls, in blood; Then, some, who for the Lamb professe, The Dragons Kingdome will increase, Untill, they shall be better taught How, living Temples should be wrought. When, you have pull'd the great Popes down, And, set up one in every Town; When, in each house, a Church shall be, And, in one house, a part of three; VVhen, one shall tell you Christ, is here; Another say, loe, he is there; More comfort they shall then receive, VVho love; then they, who these believe. VVhen, onely, number'd out, you see, VVhat, weigh'd, and measur'd, too, should bee; When all, that you shall save, or lose, Dependeth on their yeas, and noes, VVho, peradventure, may intend, Selfe-will, selfe-profit, or selfe-end; Then, selfe-deniall must proceed From words, into a reall deed; And, more regardfully you must Consider, whom you ought to trust; Least, e're this tragedy be plai'd, You, and your Freedomes be betrai'd. VVhen, cloth'd like lambs, the wolves appear, VVhen, Foxes preach, and Goslings hear, VVhen, Hawkes to guard the Doves are chose, VVhen, wounds must cured be with blowes, And, when your frogs and mice renew Their foolish warre; Then, will ensue VVhat hath by wisemen been fore-told, In tales and parables, of old; Unlesse, your keepers eye affrights The Romish Eagles, and the Kites. When, you perceive the Harper play His Harpstrings, and his Harp away; The Miter, hazzarding the Crowne; The sword, instructing of the Gowne; The members, that in darknesse be, Informing, how the Eyes should see; And, hands, and feet, aspiring to That, which the Head, and Heart should do; Then, you, a while, their lots must share, Who, in their guts, their braines do beare. When, you shall see Death richly clad, With what, the living should have had; And, then, behold a Church bespread With rags, and reliques of the dead, Exposing that to open scorn, Which was in publike triumph born: If, then, with seriousnesse you heed The simple doer, and the deed, It shall occasion shame to some, Who thought, much honour'd, to become: And, let a just occasion in To rake up, what might hid have bin. When Blocks, and Stones, offence shall take, And riots in your Cities make; Beware: for, if heed be not took, A sparke shall casually be strook, From some rough flint, which will devour Your wealth, your glory, and your power; That future times may not despise The wrath, and spleen, of Ants and Flies. When you see Gallants take their vies, As if they would ore-skip the skies, Or, give the Sun, and Moon, a Law, Yet, then, scarce over-leap a straw; Or, when conceptions-mountainous Shall bring forth nothing, but a mouse, (After great throes, 'twixt hopes, and feares, Sustained, by you, many yeares) Then, your declining state deplore, And, take a dos of Hellebore. When, here, you shall re-act the sin Of Pharoah, and of Benjamin; Keep Jezabels, and Ahabs Fast; In Jehu's mold Reformers cast; Give honour unto Golden Calves, And Idols, setting up themselves; You shall but bring, to quench your flame, That oyle, which will increase the same: And, GOD, your Offrings will despise; Till Justice be your sacrifice. When Out-lawes shall themselves propose For your Law-givers to be chose; Felons, grow makers of your Lawes; Effects, producers of their Cause; Th'accused, his own Judge become; The thief, pronounce the true-mans doome; Your greatest foes, turn seeming-friends; And, greatest wrongs get least amends: Then, to no earthly hopes aspire; But, unto GOD, alone, retire. When, most the Charmers-voice shall heare, And, like deafe Adders, stop their eare; When, they who sit in Judgment, be Inexorable, more then He Who did both GOD, and Man, despise; (And, sleight ev'n Importunities, Continu'd without intermission) Then, feare, O Britain! thy condition. When, most that heare, and pray, and fast, No sweetnesse, in those duties tast; But, formally, in them go on, Depending upon what is done; And, others, so beleeving grow, As, that, they no good works will do: Or, when small difference shall appeare 'Twixt persons, times, or places, here; And, those Ideas, men embrace, Which have nor body, forme, nor face; And, run vagaries without bound, As if, no medium's could be found, 'Twixt two extreames: Ev'n then, shall they Who love the light, enjoy the day; And, then, shall look'd for be, of some, A Kingdome, that will never come. When, in your City-paramount, This Realm is called to Account, (And, they, who do receive and pay, Forsake the old Exchequer way) If those may then their triall shun, By whom, the greatest wrongs are done, Your hypocrites will soon appeare So many, and so powerfull, here, That, GOD himself th'Accompts will take, Which they unwilling are to make. When folly, avarice, and pride, Upon the publike-Asse shall ride, And, labour to subject the State Unto that base Triumvirate; Such justice, piety, and knowledge, Will, then, proceed from Gotham-Colledge, That, blinde-men, plainly shall perceive, What, they, who see, will not believe. Then, they who now delight in lies, (Which their own malice did devise) And, those predictions do deride, Which they see daily verifi'd; Shall view with shame, and feel with feare, Those truths, of which they would not heare; And, they who, their despights have borne, Shall laugh their pride, and hate, to scorne. When, you hear thousands make their mones, And prayers, unto Blocks and Stones; Poore Suiters, prosecuting Causes In circles, labyrinths, and mazes, Till scarce a neighbour, friend, or brother, Believes, or loveth one the other; Or, till they have nor house, nor bread, Who, for the Kingdomes-cause, have bled; Then, you fulfilled shall behold So much, that, more needs not be told. When, you shall heare your Pipers play Till none will either dance, or pay; Or, till among you doth begin A second bloodie matachin; Then, will clean hands, and honest hearts, Besteed you more, then Irish darts; Secure you better from your foes, Then guards of guns, of bils or bowes; And, then, will they, whom Pride doth scorne, More happie be, then Princes-borne. When, you most sleight what Tel-troth saith; When, you have prov'd the Punick-faith; When, you see those, who have misdone, In spight of Councell, still, go on, To prosecute their wild designes; Then take you heed of those Divines, Who, to effect their carnall end, For God and Christ, will much pretend: And, that, you no way do abuse The Flat-caps, or the Clouted-shooes. When, they who greatest Traytors are, With Patriots, reward shall share, And, be with large allowance fed, VVhilst, your best servants, scarce bave bread: VVhen doing justice, shall be thought Ill manners; and, they men untaught, VVho are so daring, to afford A poor man, right against a Lord; Then, shall men purchase land, and fee, For little price; which deere will be, To ev'ry purchaser, unlesse By piety, and righteousnesse, The sale be sanctifi'd; and you Give both to GOD, and men, their due. VVhen your Reformers, shall begin To out-doe those men in their sin, VVhom to reforme they did pretend; And, like sowre ale in summer, mend: When, they the Rule shall misapply; And give by deeds, their words the lie; Till, that, be mentioned with scorne, VVhich is your praise, and saving-horne, Then, Jehu's temper will undoe you, Unlesse you can invite unto you Eliah's spirit duplifi'd On some Elisha, to provide A speedy cure, for that disease, VVhich on your Vitall-parts will seize. When, men and women blushlesse grow In filthinesse; and act it so, As if, a Stallion to be knowne, A Princely quality were growne; Or, when your Ladies do appeare (As if old heath'nish Rome were here) By Coachfulls, with a brazen face, To see men run a naked-race: And, when fin to a ranknesse springs, Beyond the reach of libellings; And, libellings so common bee, That none shall from their dirt be free, Though ne're so innocent (but those Whom no man hates, envies, or knowes) Then, look for that which will ensue Such impudence; if God be true. When, men shall gen'rally confesse Their folly, and their wickednesse; Yet, act, as if there neither were Among them, conscience, wit, or feare: When, they shall talke as if they had Some braines; yet, do, as they were mad; And, nor by reason, nor by noise, By humane, or by heav'nly-voice, By beeing praised, or reprov'd, By judgements, or by mercies mov'd: Then, look for so much sword, and fire, As such a temper doth require. When, in this Isle, you shall behold, What's term'd, the Devills ring of gold, To be in use; and, then, shall see, Both, pawn'd, and, forfeited, to be, The richest-Jewell of the State; Take order, therefore, ere too late, To save your credits: For, you know, That, London is not Mexico. Or, if it were, we plainly view, By Genoa; what may ensue. When, your Betrayers shall divide, And, seem of a contrary side, That they the better may contrive Their own Designments; or, perceive, What is endeavour'd, to prevent Those mischiefs, whereto they are bent. Then, look about you; or, be sure, Your safety you shall not secure: But, when you heare it often said, By whom, you should have been betraid, In what, they false, with you have plaid; And, how they gave your spoilers aid, With such like falshoods; and, then, see, Such common Fames, neglected be: Th'accused countenanc'd; and, those Traduc'd, and, punished, as foes, Who, out of conscience, and, of zeale, To save this drooping Common-weale, Their knowledge, and, their feare declare; Then, of a sudden blow, beware; When, they, who, but the other day, As low, as in the channell, lay; And; had nor presence, wealth, nor wit, (And, scarce the meanest of them, yet) Your most pragmatick-men become, And, places of chiefe trust assume: Your Mastives, then, shall Spaniels grow; Your Hens, and Capons, learn to crow, Disarme, and silence, all your Cocks; And, men, weare petticoats, and smocks. When you, who, at the first, begun With honesty (and, thereby, won Advantages) shall act, or plot Ill means, to keep what you have got; As, if the GOD, you seem'd to serve, Could not, as well, to you preserue, By reall virtue, what was gain'd, As, give it, by a virtue fain'd: Then, you shall thrive, as did that King, Who was or'ecome, by conquering; Because he serv'd false gods, whose lands The true GOD gave into his hands: And, you shall then, the difference know, 'Twixt being just, and seeming so. When, Justice cuts of Hydra's heads, And, sees arising, in their steads, More, and more monstrous ones, then they Whom Reformation par'd away: When Tyranny beginns to varie The form and shape, of Arbitrarie And willfull-rule; when, she inslaves By mean, and despicable knaves; When, they who 'scape the Lions-pawes, The teeth of Wolves, and Harpies-clawes: Shall look for safety, and for ease, And, then, be eat by Lice and Fleas; Or, be in pieces, rent and torne By vermine, once, below their scorne: Then; then, shall you begin to see Your masked Foes; and who they bee That sought your weal: and, then, in vain Shall wish for, what you now disdaine. Then, some, shall much perswade you to What, none but such as they would do, Who whet their knives, and cut their throat To cure a chollick, in their guts: For, then shall they, who seek your harm, Seek how to cut off your right-arm, That, of your chiefest guard bereft There may be no hand but the left To save your heads: And, then, perchance, You will perceive your ignorance. For, then, new troubles will begin, Whereby, they who have blamed bin, Shall suffer much: But, they shall beare Most burthens, who most guilty were; And, many, then, who now despise These Lines, will think them Prophecies. Then, shall they seek, and crouch, and bow Who are most proud, and surely, now; Petition long, without regard; Make prayers, which will not be heard; And, find as little mercy, then, As they have showne to other men. They, from the sword shall thither flie, Where they for want of bread shall die; Or, hoping Famine to avoyd, Be, by the Pestilence, destroy'd; Or, (that they may one sorrow shun) Into a hundred mischieves run, And, find no rest, till they repent Their pride, or, meet due punishment. Then, shall the principles that lurk Within mens hearts begin to work, Upon their humours; and, purge out Much poyson, now dispers'd about Through eve'ry Member: yet, at first, That, shall seem best, which would be worst, And, few men be so wise to know, What they were best resolve to do. For, you shall in a Medium stand, 'Twixt Ægyt, and the Holy-Land, As in suspense, whether to make A progresse thither, or turn backe To your old servitude, or worse: And, that will seem the safest course, Unlesse the Masters of your School Shall take the counsell of a Fool; And be directed and advis'd To act the thing they have despis'd. Which if they do; your foes shall be Your friends; and both be safe and free From what is fear'd; and, live together A mutuall strength to one another; Whose factions, if they long endure, Will prove a plague, without a cure. But, mark (oh City!) mark this well; (Thou, who dost all this Realm excell, In sin, and virtue) That, when thou Shalt see thy Trustees partiall grow In doing Justice; with respect Of persons; and, with high neglect Of truth and judgement: Then, unlesse The mercy and the righteousnesse Which thou pretendest, shall encrease To fortifie thee in that peace Thou yet injoy'st; and, teach thine eyes To see, wherein thy safety lyes: Thou, wilt but treasure up thy store, To make thee miserably poore; Grow, by a new-Militia strong, To ruine thine owne strength, e're long; Draw, day by day, occasions hither, Of discords, and of plagues together; Till all the plagues, through Britain spread, In thee, be gather'd to a head; And, break upon thee, in conclusion, To thy dishonour, and confusion. E're long the welfare, of this Land, Upon a ticklish point will stand; And, at that time, if you perceive The Body representative, Act by two Factions; and, admit Their Grandees, to invassall it To their designs; and captivate Their equalls: you, shall after that Find little comfort, till you see Extracted a third Party bee From out of those, to search into Their actions, and with courage do As they finde cause: But, then, you shall Perceive a turne will joy you all. And to draw neerer to the But, At which, all these our shafts are shot, When, those two Diamonds of this Land, Which are the basis, whereon stand The publike-welfare, polish shall Each other; and, quite rub off all The rotten pieces, rags, and flawes, Which disesteem upon them drawes; And, perfect make, in ev'ry thing, Our ancient threefold Gimell-ring, That's lately broke; Then, you shall see A change, that worth your praise will be: And, he that gives you stones to crack, (Which cause, perhaps, your hearts to ake) Will, when that blessed season comes, Give you a dish of sugar-plumbs. But, know, that while this Emperie Neglects her Triple-Trinitie; To wit, three Realms, beneath one Throne; Within each Realm, three States in one. And GODHEAD one, in Persons three, You shall not without troubles be: Or, possibly attaine to that Which your well-willer aimeth at, Till, you shall, purely, God adore; And to the common use, restore At least th'Essentials of that power Which makes your Earthly-saving-Tower. Which much the stronger, might be made And fairer too, if you could add To strengthen and adorn the same, Some parts of the Venetian Frame. And, know; that, when a Declaration, As publike, as a Proclamation, Shall offer to consideration, The many failings of this Nation; If, then, you seek not preservation, By prayer, and humiliation, And, by a serious Recantation; GOD, threatens sudden desolation. Now, much good do't you; And, yet, stay: Before I send you quite away, Take these blanch'd Almonds without shels, Whereto are added nothing els But, some few kernells in their stones) For, though they seem but bitter ones, Yet, if you taste them, we believe They'l prove a good preservative. First, chaw on this; that, you in vain, Seek, here a blessed peace to gain, Till justice, and till mercy, more Advanced be, then heretofore; And, till you shall have more regard To punishment, and to reward. Next, know, as vainely you presume Informed, rightly, to become In things of faith, whilst you depart From what is written in the heart; And, act contrary to the natures, And Lawes, of reasonable creatures: For, how shall they who cannot learn Things morall, things divine discern? Next, be inform'd; ev'n you, who had The righteoust cause; that, you have made Defaults enough, to let all see The best had need forgiven bee: And, let that make your hearts inclin'd To pardon all, in whom you find That penitence which doth intend Crimes past, sincerely to amend: Yea, if ye mean, in peace, to live, Let all strive, who shall most forgive; That by so doing, all may move Each other, to a mutuall-love; Which grace, they onely are deni'd, Who could be true to neither side. And, lastly, let no more despights Unto your Fundamentall-rights, And, Constitutions, now, be done: For, if the Ground-worke, be overthrowne, What, can the wise, or justman do? What to sustaine it, add thereto? Or, what will councell be, but wind, To them, whose ruine is design'd? Some, little hope is left: And, yet, Lest no effect, our words beget, That, then, the times to come, may know A Messenger was sent to show What would befall this age, before It came to passe. This one pearl more, Is cast before you,) without fear Of such, as would in pieces tear) Observe it well, O Generation, Regardlesse of thy visitation. When, you have had hard work to do, And, added five, to forty two; You shall perceive a good Play spoil'd, And, by unworthy Actors, foil'd; The Scœnes transpos'd, the Acts confus'd; The Poet shamefully abus'd: The first intention of the Plot, By those confusions, quite forgot: Yea, them, to Tragick-Acts design'd, Who enter'd with a Comick-mind; And, then, what now our eye fore-sees, (Like him, who saw men walk, like trees) Shall be discover'd, by that light, Which, never doth deceive the sight. Then, they who mark it, shall perceive Your Politicians, will contrive Their own indempnity, whilst they Pretend for yours; that, so, they may Secure themselves, from answering that, Whereby, they have abus'd the State: And, then (unlesse you can prevent The fraudfulnesse of that intent) They, who did most their wealth increase, By cheating you, will buy their peace; And, sell your Freedomes, unto those, With whom, they do designe to close. Then, will such Juggling-tricks be plaid, That, publike-debts will nere be paid, As long, as either foole, or knave, Shall have the power to give, or crave; Or, they enjoy a Trustees place, Who have put on a Janus-face. Then, most men, plainely shall behold, What, few believed, though fore-told. The noblest parts, worst plaid shall be, Till, men their errors come to see; Good-action, shall be much mistook; Ill-meanings, will be fairely spoke; Some, for ill-doing, shall have meeds; Some, shall have blame for lawfull deeds. Some, personating double parts, With double tongues, and double hearts, Shall, from one side, to to'ther run, Till they are scorn'd of ev'ry one. Fools, Clownes, and very dunghill things, Shall act the parts, of Lords, and Kings, Till, few know what to do or say; How to command, or to obey. Your Fountain shall be turn'd to puddle; Yea, all reduc'd to such a huddle; That, your Ill-willers will be glad; Your much abus'd Spectators mad; And, in their furiousnesse go near The Players rags, from them to tear; Or, pul the Stage, and Play-house down; Unlesse a med'cine, yet, unknown, Be soon appli'd: Or, on the Stage, (To stop the peoples rising rage) Some quick-devise, and pleasing-straine, Be brought, to charm them down againe. With which Catastrophe, we pray, The Tragedie, conclude you may, And, see the Scœnes, and Acts, to come, Lesse bloody, and lesse troublesome; For, if Conjectures faile him not, Who hath consider'd well the plot, (And, whose fore-warnings, none believes, Till 'tis too late), he plaine perceives A Storm will in the South be bred Whilst you a Northern-Tempest dread, And conjur'd hither, by some Fiends, Who, seem to have much better ends Then they pursue: And, then, unlesse JUDAH, and ISR'EL shall confesse Their sinnes, and, reconcile, betimes; Manasses pray, repent his crimes Unfainedly (as David did, When, from Jerusalem he fled) And, with full resolution, do What, prudence would advise him to: The Babylonians will conspire With Amalek; your neighbour Tyre Shall (as a slie spectator) stand, To take advantage under-hand: And, by those means (when peace seems near) The troubles, which did first appear In thirty nine, prolong'd will be, Till fifty two, and fifty three. And, what new courses will be took, When those yeares wheel about, Go look: For, here, already, we fore-show More, then you can deserve to know; Till, you more lovingly shall deale With such, as labour, for your weal; And, their estates, and time, have spent, Your likely ruine to prevent. Ere, GOD, his wrath on Balaam wreaks, First, by his Asse, to him he speaks; Then, shewes him, in an Angells hand, A sword, his courses to withstand; But, seeing, still, he forward went, Quite through his heart, a sword he sent; And, GOD, will thus, if thus they do, Still deale with Kings, and Subjects, too: That, where his grace despis'd is grown, He, by his judgments, may be known.

A single SI QVIS, and a quadruple QVERE, with the Occasions of them, presented to the Members of the honorable House of Commons, touching a Petition, with certain Verses annexed, and lately layd at their feet in the said House of Commons, by Major G. W. The SI QUIS, and the Occasion of it. That day, in which Victorious Cromwel sent His first Express, (to your great wonderment) Of Hamiltons Defeat; which, whilest a Scot Shall be remembred, will not be forgot: Ev'n on that Day, before your feet I spread, A sad Petition, humbly prefaced, By these ensuing lines; He that is prostrate on the floor, Lies there, whence he can fall no lower: So does this Orator of Your. Petitions, he, hath oft conveyd Into your hands; yet finds no ayd These, therefore, at your Feet are layd. Where, let them not neglected lie, Nor, unregarded, throw them by, But view them with a gracious eye. And, let our Parents not provoke Their Children, till offence be took, By which, their patience may be broke. Consider those, who lie below; For, you shall reap, what you do sow; And, find such mercy, as you show. Refresh their spirits, who are sad, As God, this day, hath made you glad, By those good tydings you have had. Among the rest, this Beadsman here, That feels the wants, which they but fear, Who, dread th'effects of this moyst year. And, blame him not, that, thus he shows His Cause, as well in Verse, as Prose, And, in a Path untrodden goes. For, scarce, Earth, Water, Air, or Fire Enjoys he; or, wherewith to hire, That Pittance Nature doth require. And, men in danger to be drownd Lay hold on any Trifle found, To reconvey them safe a ground. But, his annexed Paper view, And let him favor'd be of you, As, that, which it avers, is true. And, if for that, which he prefers His suit, there stand Competitors, Let it be neither, His, nor Theirs, But, as most equitable, it appears. These (to my Prayer fixed) for your view, I left upon the Pavement, and withdrew; In hope some kind hand, would have been extended To raise it, that my Cause might be commended To free Debate. But, six days, now, are gone, And, God, since then, the favor late bestown Doubles and triples upon you; yet, I Still at your door, unheard, unheeded, lie; And find not so much as a Friend, by whom To learn, what of those Papers is become. Of private searches, therefore, being wearie, I set up now, a Si quis, and a Quære, And, thus, it follows here: If any man, “Who sits, within your Walls, instruct me can, “How I may know, what hand convey'd away “My Prayer from your sight, upon the day “Of your glad tydings: Or, if he that seiz'd “Those humbled Papers, will be nobly pleas'd “So to produce them, that, I may obtain “Due remedy, for what they do complain; “It shall beget a servant, who will strive “To merit those Occasions it may give “Of that obligement: And, for his reward, “Shall gain him Prayers, too; which will be heard “For him, and his, perchance, when feel they may, “What 'tis to be neglected, when we pray. But, whatsoe're effect vouchsafed be; God bless the King, the Parliament, and Me. The quadruple QUERE, and the Occasion of it. Your House receiving notice, twelve moneths since, Of my long-suffrings, and known Indigence, (Occasion'd by your service,) thought it fit, To some selected Members, to commit The finding an Employment, to supply Subsistence, till, my great necessity Might be removed, by discharging that, Which is yet owing, to me, by the State: And, having long, without success attended, I now, at last, by them, am recommended To serve as one of those Commissioners, By whom, Supream Authority confers Wine Licences. Wherein, since, there appears, With me, nor few, nor mean Competitors; And that the Place, hath been aspersed by Some, lately, as a Grand-Monopoly. I humbly make these Queries. “First, Whether he, that hath suspected bin. “To hate that Cause, which you ingage us in, “Standing Competitor with him that's known “To hazard for it, more then all his own; “Can be prefer'd, without a wrong, to you, “And an incroachment, on the others due? “Next, Whether, a Competitor defam'd “For breach of Trust, (by whomsoever nam'd,) “Ought rather, by your Votes, to be befriended, “Then he, that to your House is recommended “By your own Members? and, 'gainst whom, no man “Exhibite, justly, an Impeachment can. “Then, Whether, he your Grace deserveth best, “Who hath for you, lost all his interest, “In outward things? Or they, whose wealth is more “Since these Distractions, then it was before? “And lastly, Whether ought may be compriz'd “Among things, judg'd, to be Monopoliz'd, “When all the profits, which from thence arise, “Are brought into the publike Tresuries? “And, whereof, neither one alone, nor few, “But ev'ry man receives his proper due. Consider, I beseech you; but of these Few Queries, and then do as you shall please: For, though my hopes in these poor suits may fail, Yet, in my noblest ayme, I shall prevail. Yea, ere this Land hath rest, a day will be, In which, there shall be some regard of me; And, wherein, that, which is perus'd with Jeers, Shall fill their scornful Readers full of Fears. Fiat Voluntas Dei. G. Wither. VATICINIUM CAUSUALE. A RAPTURE Occasioned By the late Miraculous Deliverance OF HIS HIGHNESSE THE Lord Protector, From a Desperate Danger. With, a NOVERINT UNIVERSI, in the Close. By Geo: Wither, Esq; Who so dwelleth in the Secret, of the MOST HIGH, shall abide in the shadow, of the ADMIGHTIE. I will not let this, slip into the Dark, Or keep the Light, without a special mark: For, when GOD Acts, or speaks, each Word and Deed. Should be observed, with some vseful heed. That, which hath hapned, cannot be undone, Or ly conceal'd; For, many Lookers on, And, (some, who love to trumpet forth Mischances, With Descantings, on all their Circumstances) Have publsh'd what befell. Thence, Rumour spreads; Puts various Fancies, into Peoples heads; And every one draws Uses, or, applies As Malice fools him, or, Love makes him wise: But, Providential favours, are exprest, As well in worst, Events as in the best; And, they who know not this, will never finde The Ports of Comfort, with an Adverse-winde, When he that heeds this, steers through all Events, Or, Censures, without fears, or Discontents: Then, as a Secret, why should we disclose From man to man, what ev'rybody knowes? And, put the Jealous Vulgar, in a fear There's somewhat done, not fit for them to hear? Why, is it whisper'd, still, as if, to be Surpriz'd by those things, from which none are free, Dishonour on his Highnesse could be throwne? Or, as if him, it misbeseem'd to owne That Action, which occasion'd an Event Producing, some external Detriment? Or, why it is conceiv'd, as if, to Us, Or, unto him, his fall were Ominous? Is it not good, we should have, now and then, Somewhat to minde us, that we are but men? And, that our trust in Princes, gasping lies In that short blast, which from their nostrils flies? When he did Fall, was it not wondrous well, That, from his seat, into GODS's Armes he fell? And, that, He falling, fell not in such wise, As they, who Rise, to fall; But, Fell, to Rise? And to Arise with an improvement too, By Thankfulnesse, for having scaped so? As also, with that Mark, upon him set, Of being GOD's especial Favourite? If, what befell, must needs be understood As Ominous; why, should it not of Good, An Omen be? (as I beleeve it will, Much rather, then prove Ominous for ill? For, who can think, that, He was saved from A Mischief, that, to Mischieves he might come? Or, that, We, by his safty, from the Curse Of Anarchy, are saved, for a worse? Or, that, when Mercies GOD, is pleas'd to shewe, They do portend some Evils to ensue? What Inference more wicked, can be brought? What more prophanely! what, more vilely thought! Tir'd with continual Cares, (in hope, to finde Refreshments, by Diversions of the minde) Er'e serious thoughts, were wholly laid aside, He grasp'd those Raines, which, he had often tride To mannage heretofore, with good successe, When, Small things he more minded; Great things, lesse: And, though he sped not, as in former time, His Acte, was not unseemely; nor a Crime, As they suppose, whose Memorie forgets, What, others, or, what, best themselves befits. For, 'twas not judged an Unprincely Game, To drive a Chariot, when th'Olimpian Fame, Was thirsted after; And, when on that Hill, Kings, with their Equals, therein shew'd their skill; And wrapt in Clouds, rais'd by their horses heeles, And, Thundrings, from their furious Charret wheeles, Were emulous, the high-priz'd Wreaths to wear Belonging to the skilfull'st Charioteer. And, what detraction, from the Reputation Of Princes, is that Manly Recreation, More now? or, then it was, when, Charles, of late, For his disport, upon the Coach-box, sate? (As many times he did) and not disdaine To let Inferiours, ride in Charles his Waine? Or, what Dishonour is it, that, through one Mishap, he fail'd, of what was, oft, well done? It was not want of skill, to use the Raine, That stout, and chast Hippolitus was slaine: But, an unlookt for, dreadful Apparition, (Of purpose rais'd, to hasten his perdition) Frighted his horses; which, with headstrong furie, Their Driver, from the Beaten paths, did hurry Among the Rocks: And, what, thereon befell, (The Storie is so known) I need not tell. Yet, this I will observe, (to make the Fable, To my Intention, further serviceable) That, though asunder dragd, his Members were, It magnifide his Wisdome, Love, and Care, Who made him sound, more then it harmed him, Who had that hurt: For, every scatter'd Lim, Was re-united, without detriment In any kinde, by that dismemberment Only, to Virbius, from Hippolitus, His name was chang'd, as, it befalleth us, When, from our Selfnesse, we are rent and torne, To be Regenerated, or New-borne. And, fo (I hope) when we have sum'd up all Which, to his Highnesse hapned, by his Fall, His gaines, will be much greater then his cost; And, nothing, but self-confidence, be lost. This, by the way: now I to that will come; Which mov'd me, on this subject to presume. A free Officiousnesse, doth me employ To be, this once, instead of Philips boy, Who, ev'ry morning, call'd on him to minde That, he was Mortal, and of humane kinde: For, though his sad disaster hath of late, In likelihood, remembred him, of that, It will not be amisse, that, I ingage His Caution, further, by this surplusage; Lest, though his Piety, shall him incline To do his duty, I may faile of mine, Who think my self oblig'd, when I shall see Occasion, his Remembrancer to be, As I have bene to others; who, thereto Gave lesse regard, then he (I hope) will do. As GOD, hath often shown, 'twas he, that, arm'd His head in battel; and, preserv'd unharm'd His Person, when the chance of Warre he tride, And thousands slaughtered fell, on ev'ry side: So, he now gives a new Experiment, That, it is he alone, who doth prevent, The Danger of his Peace; and, that, there are Perils inclosing him, when none appeare. It doth informe him, with a silent tongue, What warinesse, doth now to him belong More then in former times; and, that there are Aswell in his Retirements, as in Warre, Gards, Sentinels, and Watchings, necessary With strictnesse to be kept; lest he miscarry. Moreover, it informes, that, had he none Maligning him; Ev'n he Himself, alone, Might be his own Destroyer; by forgetting Due Care: Or, else, by acting, or omitting Such things, as have a very nigh relation, Either to Danger, or to Preservation. It calls on him, to minde, how many wayes, And meanes there are, of cutting short his dayes If GOD, prevent not: yea, it calls on him, Both, to redeeme, and husband well, his Time; And, loudly calls; that, for the Mercy showne, It may, in shewing Mercy, be bestowne: That, they, who of his Justice, well beleeve, May blesse him, for the Comforts, they receive; That, they, who, in his ruine would have joy'd, May rather wish, their own Designes destroy'd; And, that, the Blessing, may be carried on, Which, his, and our Protector, hath begun. It likewise, calls upon us all, to heed Both our own wayes; and how, GOD, doth proceed; Chiefly, in what, of late, vouchsafed was By his applying of preventing Grace, For is Deliv'rance, in whose life consists The likeliest Gard of publike Interests; And, which, includes, of Mercies, yet to come, Another Pledge: and, as it were, the sum Or, brief Epitome, of all things done For our availe, since first the Wars begun. My contemplating of his Dangers-past, Makes them seeme great: yet, it hath made this last, Exceed them all; and so great to have bin, That, surely, had not, God himself, stept in, To bring him Succour, suddenly from heav'n No safety had been found; no Quarter giv'n. Thus have we seen, a tender Mother, run (Or, rather fly) when her dear only Son Was innocently playing in the street; And snatch him, from among the horses feet Indangering his Life: Thus, have we seen A Loving Bridegroome, throw himself between Death, and his Bride; and bravely fetch her from A Peril, which was desperate become. To tell this Danger, were to tell you that, Which I can better Fancie, then relate; And, which (as I conceive it) cannot well Be better showne, by any parallel, Then when a brave Ship, on huge Billowes tost, With Sails full-spread, Helme broke, and Ruther lost, Is by a strong storme, in the darkest night, Forc'd to a strange Coast, with a winde fore-right, Upon the Rocks, which over-hanging, lie, The foming Flouds, a hundred fathomes high; Where, every Wave, all cries for help, out roares; Threating destruction, both from Seas and shoares: Where, can be seen nor Earth, nor Heav'n, nor Light, But dark blinde wayes, to everlasting night; And, where, no succour, finde admittance can By all the Power, and all the wit of man. By this Description, you, perhaps, may guesse From what a depth of desp'rate dang'rousnesse His Hignesse was repreev'd; and, who, alone Must, then, be his Deliverer, or none. Thence, you may likewise, gather, if you will, (And not continue blinde, and froward, still) Who takes charge of him; Whom, they do oppose; Who without cause, at this time are his Foes; And, for what end, such aids vouchsafed be In great immergencies; And, so may HEE. Oh! let us, therefore, better now, improve The evidences of Eternal Love, Then we have done: and, let his Highnesse, minde, How bountiful, how gracious, and how kinde, Our GOD hath been to him; that, so he may Unto his People, part thereof repay, In love to them: Let him remember, too, Had he miscari'd, what had been to do: What, likely to be suffer'd; not alone By some of us; but, ev'n by ever'y one, Who breaths the British aire; and, not despise This Counsel, though the Giver seeme unwise. Yea, let it be consider'd, (to improve A hast'ning, unto Unitie in Love) What sad Confusions, had anew been hurld. Upon this much unsetled British world, (And, upon others, whom we would respect) If, what was almost done, had took effect. Let this great Mercy, never be forgot; Chiefly, of him, who hath the largest Lot In this Deliverance; Lest worse he speed, When of a Helper, he shall stand in need. And, let it make him, more to hasten on That, which his Prudence prompteth should be done; Lest, some such Humane Casualtie prevents The manifesting of his good Intents, And gives his Foes, occasions to beleeve Their owne vaine thoughts; And makes his friends to grieve. I doubt not, what I counsel: If I did, It had with me, in mine own heart, lain hid. But, He, who me emboldneth unto this, Perswades me, that my aims, I shall not miss: Gives me, for earnest of them, a presage, Of healths Returne, with future Tutulage: Shews me, by what conditions, he may gaine Th'Eshablishment, he labours to obtaine; And (secret things consider'd) bids me, tell him, 'Twas Mercy, not a Mischief, that befel him: That, also, there are greater Mercies, yet, For him, reserv'd; if he shall not forget This Favour; nor the Vowes, and Protestations, Made heretofore, to GOD, and to these Nations: Assures me, that, on these Conditions lies, The highest glory, whereto he can rise; And, that, if he escape the stumbling stones, Environing th'Ascent, to Earthly Thrones, He, without fear of any harme, shall tread On Vipers, Aspes, and on the Dragons head: That, Emperour to stile him, should not better His happy Lot, or make him ought the greater; But, rather seeme, a foolish over-lay Of purest Ophir Gold, with common Clay. Thus, otherwhile, Remembrances I scatter, As, GOD, and Man's proceedings, offer matter; Not without some discernable effect: (Though neither they, nor I, gain much respect.) For, on my Self, they have an operation Not needlesse; yea, the lesse good acceptation, They have with others, they, thereby, to me The more effectual, sometimes rendred be; And, teach me to be quiet, and to beare What misbefals me, with more Joy, then Care. Thus, when the Bowes of Malice are ful bent, And, poys'ned shafts, made ready to be sent Against th'upright in heart; I, interpose Minerva's sheild, sometimes, unknown to those Whom it secures; and, when, for what was done, Others, with all the thanks, away have gone. Long since, with suchlike Spels, and Charmes as these, I did assay, to cure the Kings disease; But, either, he was over-deaf to heare, Or else, not strong enough, my Charmings were. Oft, afterward, I sung unto the State, Some Lessons which, when 'twas a day too late, Were called for; and frequently there fell Much ill to me, for wishing others well. Sometimes, I, to the Common-people fidle To still their madnesse; and, oft foole, and riddle To make them wiser: but, with little gaines, To them; and, losse of labour, for my paines. And now, to charme those, I endeav'ring am, Who seek to turne his Glory, into shame, Whom GOD, hath honour'd; That, I might make lesse (If possible) their sottish bruitishnesse, Who wound themselves, through him; and scoff and jear At Mercy, shown to their Deliverer, In such a Danger, as could be, by none Removed, but, by an Almighty-one. Vaine sons of men, how long, will ye despise Good Counsel! and, still, follow after Lies! Not knowing, or not heeding, that, GOD hath Maugre your Spite, your Envie, and your Wrath, Made him to be your Lord, whom you contemn; To Supream honours height, advanced him; Laughs you to scorn; Turns al your oppositions, To his advantage and your own perditions: Not heeding, GOD, hath given all these Lands; All these three Nations, up, into his hands; And, him, on them bestow'd; to make proof, whether He, or else They; or, both of them, or neither, Will hearken to his Voice: that, he may do, What their proceedings will incline him to. Fooles! 'tis not as you dream: But, whatsoe're He Was, or Is, or, shall to you appear, GOD, from among your selves, did him advance, To gard his Flocks, and his Inheritance; To be a friendly comforter of those, Who are his Friends; A terror to his Foes: And, what, you fret and storme at, was not done, By mans designments; but, by GOD, alone. Through all these Islands, be it therefore known; And, to all persons, every where, which own, Relation to this Empire; that, by him, Who hath dispose of every Diadem, (Of Scepters, Crowns, &amp; Thrones) the change was made, Which did remove the Government we had; (When our great sins deserv'd to be bereft, Of all those Priviledges, which are left) And, that, GOD, in meer mercy, did translate The Power, which was in other men, of late, To be with him intrusted, who is now Stil'd, your PROTECTOR. Know, likewise, that, you Are bound, by Law and Conscience, to obay; And humbly at his Throne, your selves to lay On those Conditions, only, whereon, he Hath your Protector, undertook to be. Moreover, Be it known, that, if he shall Performe his Part; and, you perversly fall Into rebellious actings; or, not cease From those, which may disturbe the common-peace; His Scepter, shall, perforce, your stif necks bend To that, which he doth Righteously intend; And, either thereunto obedient make you, Or, therewith, bruise; or, else, to peeces break you: Lest, your perversnesse, bring a Tirant hither, To break us; never to be set together. And, that, if prudently you do comply, He may, at last, improve his Sov'raignty, To make you farre more happy, and more free, Then else, you had been, or had means to be. And, now great OLIVER, to thee, likewise, Let this be known; and, do not thou despise The Publisher; GOD, doth expect to have Honour from them, to whom he honour gave: That, such, who have the rule o're men, be just: That, they their Vowes infringe not, nor his trust: That, they consider, he bestowes large measure, Of Power upon them, not to act their pleasure, Or to fulfill their lust; but, doth inlarge His Bounty, that their Place, they may discharge With Courage: That, he Riches doth provide, Lest Avarice, might draw their hearts aside; Or, wants, to do injustice, them compell: That, he gives honours, not to make them swell Above their Brethren; but, them, to exempt From what, may fall upon them, by contempt: And, that, all these things, are on them bestown, Much more, for others sakes, then for their own. Know SIR, that, GOD, from persons in your place, Expects all this; and thereto offers Grace, And Power, for asking: That, (what ere some say) He, none necessitates to go astray; Nor leaves, nor hardens any (not the worst) Till, Love to selfnesse, makes them, leave him first. If, this, thou well considering, shalt act Accordingly; performing thy Contract, With GOD, and with his People; he, shall then, Give thee the Love, and Hearts, of all Good men: Fixe thee as firmly, as the Rocky shoares, Which sleight the Ocean, when it foames and roares: And brighter make thy Fame, and spread it more, Then any mans renowned heretofore: For, in Fames Book, thou maist inrolled be The first, who, made a People truly free: And first-borne, of those Viceroyes, who, shall take Their Throns from HIM, whose Kingdom down will break, All Monarchies of Tirants; with all those, Who, help patch up, the Clay and Iron toes, The Reliques of that Image, which hath bin The prop of him, that's call'd, the man of sin. All this may be: and, if thou strive to go The way, that open lies; It shall be so. Oh! lose not this advantage, for a Buble, Which, in vain hope, begins, &amp; ends with trouble. And, lastly, Be it known, (not by event Which may be to thy future detriment, But, by pre-caution) that, if faile thou shalt Without this Peoples obstinate default, Of what they, justly may from thee expect, Who art advanc'd their freedomes to protect; Or shalt abuse thy Power, them, to oppresse; Or, leave them unreliev'd, in their distresse, So, that, they must be forc'd to cry, and call, To GOD, for help: GOD, hear, and help them shall: Search what is done: And, though their former sin, Hath great, and full of provocations bin, He, for the present time, will passe it by, And on thy failings, only, cast an eye: Avenge their Cause; call thee, accompt to give, Of all those Favours, which thou didst receive; (Of that late Mercy, too, among the rest, Which hath occasion'd, what, is here exprest) And, with much indignation, cast thee down, When, to its height, thy Confidence is grown. Yea, they, who shall most flatter, and with whom Thou, shalt, then, think most safe thou mayst become, Will help destroy thee: And, this, shall to Thee A sad presage, of thy destruction be, Which, may be made a Prophecie Divine, Of Everlasting Good, to Thee, and Thine. But, to his Saints, GOD, gives a blessed close; And, keeps his Vengeance, only, for his Foes. Thus, I have shown, that, Mercy which produces Contempt in Scorners, came for better uses: Let it, by all, whom it concerns, be weigh'd; And, when, I've more to say, It shall be said. Geo. Wither. Epistolium-Vagum-Prosa-Metricum: OR, An Epistle at Randome, IN PROSE and METRE. To be delivered, to all whom it may concern; but, was first intended only, for two or three of the Authors Friends in Authority (if he hath so many left) to mediate in Parliament, the Redress of his destructive Grievances; in the expression whereof, many Particulars of Publick Concernment are interwoven. When Justice raigns, the Land doth flourish; When, 'tis unthron'd, the People perish.The Author, is George Wither Esq; Who, in writing this Address, being transported beyond the sense of his Personal Sufferings, discovers by a Poetical Rapture, that whereon the peace of these Nations depends; and, what IS, and what VVILL BE, their sad Condition; as also, what New-Purgatories, and Fiery-Tryals, they are likely to pass, if GOD's Mercy, prevents not: which that they may endeavour to obtain, their old Remembrancer gives them, once more, a Fore-warning; resolving, this shall be his Last Time, of sounding them an ALARM. When Disrespects, to Wrongs doth Ruine adde, He, may be wise, who seems a little mad; And, in that FIT speak things that needfull be To cure those men, that are, more mad then he. [When I was young, these Words my Motto were] When I was young, these Words my Motto were I, neither have, nor do I want, or care: And, Death, will make them truer then they are. [Though very much, and long, I have endur'd] Though very much, and long, I have endur'd, And, desp'rate Griefs, must desp'ratly be cur'd; I, try no extaordinary Courses, Till strong necessity thereto inforces: For, though sometimes, I feel so great a smart, That, I am therewith pinched at the heart, I, still finde ease, within a little space, By Patience, well prepared with Herb-grace. My Genius, lately mov'd me to this Charm, (Which, if it doth no good, can do no harm) And, therefore, I thus prove it: GOD, direct And, bless it, with a prosperous effect: For, if what over-hangs us, at this time, Nor Prayers, Narrative, nor Prose, nor Rime, Nor Reason, can incline this Generation In sixteen years, to Justice, or Compassion, I, shall believe my days of private mourning, Must, till another Publick-overturning Prolonged be; or, else, till I shall have A Cure for all my Suffrings, in the Grave. However, (as I do) I will till then To keep my Claims on foot, employ my Pen Sometimes in private, to make Proof of those Who to the World-ward, have made holy shows That either by their ayd, I may obtain, What, I have long petition'd for in vain; Or, that to men unborn, I may declare How merciless, their Predecessors, were; How shamelesly unjust; how may ways GOD proved them; how many several days, Weeks, months and years, he waited, to make tryal, How long, they would defer that self-denial Which they had voted; and that, times to come, May glorifie GOD, in the Final Doom; Which, to the World, will openly be known In greater Judgments, or, in mercy shown, When our three Factions, parallel to them, Which were the Ruine, of Jerusalem Have acted out, their Parts; and left the Stage, To those, who shall begin another Age. GOD, is the same, in all his Attributes (Whatere to him, our Vanity imputes) And, just now, by the Eies of Contemplation, I see a mixed-Cup in preparation, Wherein, such Drugs are blended, sharp &amp; sweet, As, for our present Maladies are meet; By which, I gess, what things may come to pass, As Good, or Evil Counsels we embrace; And, I will tell my Thoughts, though being told, I fear, they will be slighted as of old: For, I confess, that which my Soul foresees, She sees like him, who saw, men walk like trees. The ruine of the BEAST, is now at hand, Which doth as yet, the HOLY-LAMB withstand; And, he of late, hath so affrighted been, Lest, his approaching Downfal must begin Among these Nations, that, with all his might He seeketh means his Vassals to unite Who must assist him; and in secret wise, He hath conveyed hither, in disguize, Those Locusts, which ascended with a smoke, Whereby, they unperceiv'd, Disguizes took Of sev'ral Forms, resembling many Creatures Of diff'ring Shapes, and of as diffring Natures, To hide their Fraud; These, lately pow'r have had By Sorceries, to make the people mad, And, by fomenting Discords, to destroy The means, whereby, that peace they might enjoy Which would preserve them, &amp; prepare a path To that great work, which God determin'd hath. For, though the sons of Belial, do condemn This Power, which God hath now set over them, Because, in outward shew, no such effect Is like to spring, from thence, as they expect; Yet, shall the Power (against which many prate, And raile, and write, maliciously of late) Henceforth, from Violence, protected stand, And be destroyed by no mortal hand Except their own; and, till they shall in heart From just and pious Principles depart: But, either quite destroy, or foil all those, Who, them, in their Authority oppose. Yea, though, those Interruptions they have had, Whereby, they are not, now, so able made As they may be, when time, adds thereunto Compleatness, for the work they have to do: They are, all that's remaining at this season, Conducible thereto, in humane Reason; And, what to disadvantage them, doth seem, May give them, at the last, the more esteem. The more contemptible, they now are thought, The more dishonour will on them be brought Whom they subdue. If, they be poor, and weak, The louder, to his glory, will that speak Which, he, by them effects, who foils proud Kings And mighty Foes, by despicable things. This, is the power, whereto we should adhere; And, though to many men, it doth appear Both by deficiency of Members lame, And, some, still to retain, who do it shame) 'Tis GOD's Reserve, to save us from the Curse Which we deserve: and we should make a worse (As we are qualifide) if, he, now should Permit things to be done, as many would, Who know not, what some underhand intend, That make fair shews, their Freedoms to befriend. GOD, hath like Daniel in the Lyons Den Them, from the beastly rage, of brutish men Preserved hitherto, (ee'n, when to me It seem'd impossible, they safe could be) And, this not for their righteousness was done; But, meerly for his mercy sake alone, That, those few, who their trust in him repose, Be not insulted over by their Foes. For, in them now, the safety doth consist Of ev'ry justly-claimed interest, And, of each person, who seeks not to do Those things, that are destructive thereunto; Or, to himself, by breaking of that peace Which tendeth to our gen'ral happiness. If to make up this Representative There do remain but forty men alive Of all those persons, which all England thorow Should represent each City, Shire and Burrough, If they be persons principled aright, Who in the fear of GOD themselves unite, They shall perform the work that's to be done, As if of their full number wanted none: Nay, better, though among them there be some Who to that work destructive would become. That number, them, doth lawful constitute By Custome, and for Action doth repute Sufficient (whilst together they shall stay) Though all the rest absent themselves away, And to exclude all, who offensive are, Though, one half of their hands and eyes they were. They are essentially, as fully free To all Intentions, as they need to be, Or can be now made, without extirpation Of that, which is for common preservation, Made lawful, by a Law confirming more True, Soveraignty, then any heretofore; Ev'n by a sentence, for this Commonweal. Decreed by him, from whom there's no appeal: And all the Arguments which I have yet, Heard or perused, to invalid it, Are so infirm, so frivolous and vain, That, whilst it here, a Being shall retain, I'll add thereto, my help, to make them strong, Whether to me, they shall do right or wrong. Which help, though chiefly it, consists in words, Will sometimes be as useful as their swords, Unless despis'd: And, if they can believe What will be said, such help, this Charm will give Though it begins with terors. Mark it well: For, 'tis a helpful and a lawful SPELL. The Drums are beaten up. The Trumpet sounds Alarums, threatning future Deaths or Wounds. That Grand Conspiracy, which was foretold And typifi'd, by Isr'els foes, of old, Is forming up a Body, to prevent What may arise out of this Parliament; Ashur, and Ammon, Amaleck, and Tyre, Yea, Earth and Hell, against them, now conspire. Their Foes, from all parts, do begin to clustre, Gog, Magog, and the Man of Sin do mustre Their Forces up. In their own bosome, lies An Ambush too, of dangerous enemies; And, nothing gives me so much cause of fear, As, that, which may lye hid in secret, there. Yet that fear, is surmounted far by Hope, Which, hath unto despairing set a stop: For, they are that small Remnant, whence may spring Those Armies, of our everlasting King, Which will subdue the world, and set his Throne Upon the ruines of great Babylon, IF, they desert not, what they have profest, And, in his favour, lose their interest: That IF, remembring (left before the I, We set the F, and cry aloud, Oh FI) Let them be mindful, in humiliation, That this year, is their last year of Probation; And of all willful failings, now take heed, Lest worse things, then befel them, do succeed. Let them take courage also, and not fear What, they shall either suffer, see, or hear: For, he that saves by few; the wise, befools, Defeats the strong, and works with any tooles Resideth yet among them; and will never Forsake them, whilst they do their best endeavor. That, so it may be done, let them still minde, Both what's before them, and what lies behinde. Let them remember, He that stands may fall, That, ev'ry promise is conditional; And, that, GOD's promises, will be to them Perform'd, as they to others, and to Him Perform their promises: for, though this wrong He pardons oft-times, and forbeareth long, There is a set time, which now draweth near, In which, he will, no longer, so forbear. Let no man slight these Cautions, though by him, Pronounced, who may despicable seem: For, in these days, it often comes to pass That, GOD, speaks, (as to Balaam by his Asse) To wisest men, by those whom Fools they deem; To Kings, by persons that ignoble seem; And, if their Wills, as wilfully as he They shall pursue, like his, their End shall be. This Power now ruling, raigns by God's Commission; Yet, not without a fore-premis'd condition: For, by unrighteousness, it shall not stand, Though it were as the Signet on his hand. If, they themselves with outward washings, flatter, And shall not cleanse the inside of the platter; If, those defects of Justice and Compassion Which lately brought Confusions on this Nation, Be not forthwith repair'd in some degree, (As means by GOD's grace, will vouchsafed be.) And, if a Model truly Genuine, This August sixteen hundred fiftynine, Be not conceiv'd, and fully born, before The time, exceeds the end of nine moneths more, With all the essential parts, of such a thing, As may receive a timely perfecting, (To qualifie that Rage, which may increase The Breaches made into the Common-peace) Then, all that this Power, thenceforth can endeavour, Will either be a nullity for ever; Or else, a furth'rance, to that horrid pother Which will make facile entrance for another Oppressing hand, that, will but Justice do So far, as Vengeance doth amount unto. Hear this with patience; altho spoke by me: Consider well, if thus it may not be, All ye, whom it concerns: For Israels Rock, (Who hates requiting mercies with a mock) Hath said, that he must rule with Righteousness Who doth ov'r men, a ruling power possess; And, we have felt, that Piety is vain, Unless therewith morality, doth raign. But, all may yet be well; unless, the Beast With many heads, mars their own interest By ignorance, or wilful disobeying; Or else, our Trustees (by our trust betraying) Fail in performing, at their promis'd day, That, which is hop'd for, and for which we pray. Most awful GOD! who when this world was made, Gav'st that a Being, which no Being had: Whose Wisdom, from a Chaos made of nought, All things into a perfect order brought; And, by thy Word, eternally Divine, Didst out of Darkness, cause the Light to shine; Enable those, who have the present Power, To act, what will be for their Weal and our. And now, Oh all ye people of this Land, At their need, aide them, with a liberal hand And loyal heart, to act for your avail: Let not the fault be yours, if they shall fail: Lay all your Animosities aside, For, though to them dishonour may betide, The Consequence thereof, will make you sorry: Their shame, will be the ruine of your glory. If, otherwise it happen, what success May follow, 'twill be needless to express, And, to prevent it, I, thus often, here, Adde this word IF, (which else less needful were) For, great will be our sorrows, when they shall Unmindful be of that conditional. We many ways lye open to perdition; And, GOD, hath Magazeens of Ammunition Enough, to punish, all Offenders, either Singly; in parties; or else, all together As he shall please: yet, he vouchsafes a show, Of such things, as he probably may do; That, we, our wills, and practises may bend To act with Him, in what he doth intend. Those Judgments, may not all at once ensue, Which may be fear'd, and will be justly due; For, GOD's Long-suffering, shall perhaps once more Justice with Mercy mix, as heretofore; And, prove us, by a means, that some abhor, And, other some, have madly longed for. We have a Grand-Foe, whom he laid aside, And, will reserve, till he hath foolifi'd Their Expectations, who forgetful grow Of what they suffer'd, but a while ago: And, as he shew'd how mischievous a thing, The Jews desired, when they crav'd a King, By granting of it: (that, they might perceive By feeling, what they would not else believe) So, by the like Experiment, perchance, He'll once more, cure this Nations ignorance: Because, the gracious sentence by him given On their behalfs, within the Court of Heaven, Hath been by them despised, and contemn'd, By siding with the party, there condemn'd. Good GOD! how dare such Traytors to pretend Their Countries Laws, and freedoms to befriend? What Humane Law, or Power, will such as they With Conscience, or due Loyalty obey, Who disobey Thine? Justifie thy Foes? Thy awful sentence, wilfully oppose? And, either will have him, to fill the Throne, VVhom Thou hast thence ejected, or else none? This Provocation, may thy Justice move By some enlargement of his Chain) to prove How fit, for what he claims to be his own, That Out-cast, is by thy Corrections grown. At that time, (if, it possible shall be That such a time, may be vouchsaf'd by thee) If, he, unfeignedly himself resigne To that Course, which thy Providence Divine May dictate, to compleat an Instrument For settling such an equal Government As by thy Laws, and by the Laws of Nature, Belong'd of old unto the humane-Creature, And, will conduce unto the Common-good, VVithout expence of Treasure, or of Blood; A Blessing might succeed unto these Nations, Beyond our present hopes and expectations: And, they, who now are plotting to make voyd Thy purposes; would see their own destroy'd. Then, should the glorioust work be brought to pass, That ever for mans good, designed was; And, way made, for that Kingdome, which their pride Doth, as a meer Phanatick Dream deride; And which, some Saints, too, (who in faith attend The coming of it) much misapprehend, By fanc'ing things, which greatly inconsist VVith such a Kingdom, as is that of CHRIST. VVhose final Conquests, not a Carnal-Sword Must make; but, that two-edged one, the Word; Ev'n that victorious Instrument, the Truth, VVhich doth proceed out of his sacred-mouth. And, they, whom he doth arm against his Foes VVith tother Sword, are but in place of those By whom the trees &amp; stones, were feld &amp; squar'd, VVhen matter for the Temple was prepar'd: Partly by servants of the King of Tyre, (Who wrought not for God's honor, but for hire) Partly by Solomons; who did intend Their labours, to a far more noble end. If, he premised, shall have an intent This way to act; and such a settlement Can bring to pass, as may preparatory Unto the Kingdom of Gods Grace and Glory Appear to be; he, thereby should attain More honour, then to repossess again The Kingdoms lost, and to have thereunto Annexed, three times thrice, as many moe: For, then, that Roman-Monarchy, whose date From her full-growth, with His, who sprang from that Seems numb'red, to the set time of their falls, In that sum, which her proper numerals Make up (when simply joyn'd in numeration According to their worth in valuation, Reck'ning from that year in which CHRIST was slain, And in which, Rome did to her height attain) Should fall by his ayde; and win him a share In that, which for thy Saints, thou dost prepare; And I do wish he may (by shunning that VVhich hazards it, before it be too late) Be partner in that honour, if it be No bar, to what determin'd is by Thee. He, might, then, possibly survive to view How far forth my Conjecture will prove true, Who (finding that the length of Satans chain, And of the time in which that BEAST must raign, Are, as they should ensue successively, Summ'd, in M. D. C. L. X. V. and I, Which takes in every Roman numeral) Do gess the time, when Babylon shall fall; Will yet be forty years, or thereabout. In which account, although I may be out, Of this I'm certain; that it shall not stand Beyond thy time, and that thy time's at hand. But, should God (unto whom alone 'tis known, What special mercy, shall to him be shown) Vouchsafe to prove him, and he then contemn That Course, which Justice will propose to him, As probably he will, and covet that, Which was by others, lately aimed at. If, he strive, to establish such a Throne As his forefathers lately sat upon; He, may prolong the Judgements, and the wrath Which, on these Isles, God's Angel poured hath. He, may be vexed, and inrag'd like them Who, when they should repent, do but blaspheme; As many now do, and as 'twas foretold That (when GOD'S wrath, was poured out) they would. He, may defer the mercies, which appear To many of the Saints, approaching neer: But, nothing better can be hoped from That Kingdom, which his Party prays may come, Or from himself; till we more cause have got To trust him, then his falshood to the SCOT May promise; or, their Tutorings, from whom He, fraighted, with ill Principles may come. Almighty God (should he be pleas'd to prove him) Can suddenly destroy him, or remove him If he, when re-admitted, tyranniz'd, Or, from what he profest, apostatiz'd: He, that can make the worst thing serve his ends, As well as that, which to his pleasure bends, May make what proofs he will: But, we who know No more, then what time, and events do show, Must Act as Reason dictates: Else, we shall Or may be ruin'd, by what will befall. If we well weigh what hazards they will make Who, to keep tame that Lyon undertake, W?? from the dam hath liv'd wild in the wood, And been a long time fed with humane-bloud, And also, what a charge, and what a pain It is to keep him always in a chain. If, we heed well, what Plagues unsufferable, It threatens, hither to admit the Rabble Of Malecontents, which that ejected King, Would with him, by his re-admission bring; How much, those will deceive their expectation, Who are most zealous of his restauration; And, that, our charge, our dangers &amp; our trouble, They will in likelihood, much more then double, Rather then make our miseries the less, Or, bring with them, a settlement of Peace; These, &amp; such things consider'd, we, are more Then mad-men, if we him again restore; Unless, GOD sends him for a punishment, Or makes him such a real penitent As was Manasses; whereof, we yet have No signs, nor so much faith as to believe So great a Miracle, when there is nought To us appearing, why it should be wrought. I, write not thus (and, GOD, so prosper me, As this is truth) that, he debar'd should be From ought, which for his weal might be enjoy'd; But, that, my Countries weal be not destroy'd. I am no Foe to him, because that so He is to me; but, as my Countries foe, Or, one, who seeks unjustly to become Possest of that, which GOD debars him from; And, I believe, (whatere he, may suppose,) Scarce one man in a hundred, among those VVho, now his cause, or him, seems to befriend, Doth it, for any conscionable end, Or love to him, so much, as out of hate To those, who now possess the Chair of State, Through hate, or Envy; or, in hope that they Shall by a change, be profited some way: And that the most part, mov'd through levity Neither considring, what they do, or why They so would have it, only, ebb and flow According as the present winde doth blow: For, most of these are but deluded Fools; Men, from malignant Families, or Schools New come; or, else, of desperate Estates, Or, of crackt Credits, or of crackt brain'd-pates; (Or, such as live by vanity and sin) Who, most desirous are to bring him in. And, I believe, that all men, whom he draws To joyn with him, shall perish in his Cause. Tho some, (whom we know liers, and intend To cheat us,) very much of late commend His manners, praise his meekness, magnifie His Christian Patience, and his piety; And have induc'd some honest men, to hope He is not so vow'd vassal to the Pope As we have heard: yet, they who find the fraud, And purposes, of those who him applaud; (As also, whereunto they, are inclin'd, Who publish this,) are not become so blind, As not to see the bottom, and the end Whereto their words and their endeavours tend. And, these (not without cause) are much afraid A Wolf, may in a Lamb-skin, be araid. These fear, that from the Skarlet Strumpets Cup He, and his Party, have such dregs drunk up, That, they are now in those Distemperatures, Which renders them incapable of cures; And, so much, with those vanities, besotted Whereon most Princes of the earth have doted, That, these, when their hopes, are at height, will feel (Like ill-wrought clay, upon a Potters wheel) Themselves, to durt be crumbled in the making; Or, crack, and break to pieces, in the baking: And, that, whatere the Peoples dotages May promise, there will be no hope in these Or in their Prince; unless there may be given A testimonial of their change from heaven: Nor, will it be for our advantage, then, Unless, we also, be reformed men. How, GOD, of him, or will of us dispose Is kept in secret, and he, only knows: But, whether, he shall better be, or worse, (Likely to be a blessing, or a curse) He, neither is so good, nor yet so bad, But, he, or such another, will be had As we demean or selves. Such, as are we, Such, ev'ry way, our Governours will be. For, GOD, gives ev'ry People, as their dues, Such men to be their Princes as they chuse; And whether, good or bad, puts them together, To be a curse, or blessing to each other; Till them from their allegiance he shall free, As their demerits, or their merits be Relating to themselves, or unto him, That is the Soveraign over both of them. Ah! were this Generation, but as wise As compleat, in their martial Bravaries; Or, but as meek, as they are wise in show, And knew as well, the things they do not know As those they do; and could more lay aside Their avarice, their selfness, and their their pride, Which bar them from the knowledge, &amp; the love Of that, which would their best expedient prove: They would begin, their failing more to mark; Find how they grope, and stumble in the dark, And, GOD, would give them open eyes to see How, and whereby, their peace might setled be; And that the Course whereby they thought to flourish Is but a by-path, to their ways that perish. As we are yet, our struglings be in vain, To cast our burthens, and shake off, our chain: We do, but, when one side, doth scorch &amp; burn, The other side, upon the Gridiron turn: Or, shall but leap, (do whatsoe'er we can) Into the Fire, out of the frying-pan; Till, we our duties, better think upon To GOD-ward, then we hitherto have done; Until more generally, we do obey This Power, which over us now beareth sway; Till also, they make good the expectation Conceiv'd, since their additional-probation; And, till among these Nations, here be seen A greater change, then hitherto hath been. But, what change can here be, to set all right, But such a change, as must destroy us quite, And make all new? unless, the change be made By him, from whom, all things their being had? Or, some expedient, or reserve be found Like that, made use of, when the World was drown'd? For, most among us, are grown so deprav'd, That, very few, can to Good use be sav'd. Their wisdom, power and wealth, most men imploy The welfare of each other to destroy. The Common-people, do not understand Those things, which GOD, and men have now in hand; And, give assistance to rebellious Forces, By railings, imprecations, skoffs and curses, Instead of Prayers; and, so mis-believe, That, now, no Charmer, can them undeceive. So harsh and general a Diapaze Of discords, in no Climate ever was Since in Jerusalem the triple-faction Foremention'd, wrought incurable distraction. No People ever were so blinde, so giddy, So vain, so false, mad, foolish, and so heady, But, where a sad unparallel'd confusion Threatned to bring a terrible Conclusion. They, like to Sampsons Foxes, from each other Turn heads; but, are united so together With Firebrands, by their tails, that, as well they Who run the same, as they w?? thwart their way Destroy the Cornfields thorow which they run, And, meet with greater mischiefs then they shun He, that oppresseth, doth of those complain Who, do apparent wrongs by him sustain; And, oft, finds means to tell so smooth a tale, That innocence is dasht against the wall: He, that the truth, nor loves, nor tells, nor teaches, Writes, fights, pretends, yea, pays, and prays, and preaches, As if he did profess it without guile; Yet, is a friend to falshood, all the while. Some, without honesty, the truth profess, Some, hold the truth, but in unrighteousness; And, twixt these two, (as they the power divide) CHRIST, and most honest men are crucifide. With Tragedies, they make their Party glad, And, joy in that, for which good men are sad. They love no news, like that which breedeth strife, Lies, (as if they were nourishments of life) They feast on; and at them, who their untruths Disown, they storm, as if then, from their mouths The bread were snatcht: yea, when they know them false, They love to tell, and hear, seditious tales, By which the Common-peace may be orethrown, Although thereby, they quite destroy their own, And multiply those burthens, which, they lay To their Charge, who, had took them else away; Or, if not hindred in their enterprize, By malice, falshood, and Apostacies. Their slandrous Tongues, and Pens, whom wound they not Save him that is unknown, or else forgot. They skoff, and jeer (not wickedness and folly, W?? may be jeer'd) but things that are most holy: And, since times round began, no humane eyes Did read so many cursed blasphemies, So much prophaness, and scurrility, Or such impure and filthy ribaldry, As in this Isle, hath in so little space, Been publish'd, to our National disgrace. But, what can more from those expected be Who think none but licentious men are free? And, whose ambition, more affects to have The freedom of a Beast, or of a Slave, Then that which both by nature, and by grace, Belongs of right, unto the humane race? Like earboar'd slaves, (who, bondmen have been made So long, that, when their freedom may be had They slight it) so do these; and, as conceiving There were, no possibility of living In this world, (or hereafter to be sav'd) Except they serv'd a Tyrant, and were slav'd; They, now rebelliously, a Captain chuse To lead them back to bondage, like the Jewes; As if it were designed by these Nations To be like them, in all their deviations. Oaths, against Oaths, and Covenants are took, Fitter to be repented of, and broke Then to be kept; and, Piety, they make A seeming warrant to infringe and break That which obligeth all mens Consciences, And, wherewith, nor GODS Laws, nor mans dispenses, Thus, at this present, constituted is This Nation; and, what change, must mend all this? Oh madmen! (if ye are not so bereft Of reason, that among you none is left) Be you your selves the Judges, if I lay That to your charge, which is not as I say. Or, whether I dar'd say it, in a time So wicked, without warranty from him, Who, in this sad day of our Visitation Inclines me to it, for your preservation. To cure these Frenzies for his future glory, GOD, is preparing a New-purgatory, To purge what may be purged from the dross, That, of the Pure Gold there may be no loss. The Judgements, now beginning, shall go round, And through these Islands, till all those are found Who have been false, in that which they profest To GOD, or to the Publick-Interest. From house to house, from man to man, they shall Procession make, till they have seiz'd on all. All shall be proved, whether poor they be Or rich, or, of a high or low degree, By outward, or by inward fiery trials, Till they are brought to real self-denials Twixt GOD and them, through mercy to repent Their failings; or, to outward chastisement. Those, who shall in this Island, scape his hand, Vengeance, will seize on, in a Forraign-Land: The Foes of Peace among the Common-rout, A Pestilence, or Famine shall root out. They, who have shuffled from the Souldiers fury, Shall fall into the mercy of a Jury; And, when they, from the Sword, are in some hope To hide; shall then be hamper'd in a Rope. The mischiefs they have shunned in the street, Within a secret Chamber, they shall meet. Those men, whom nothing publickly pursues, Their Consciences, in private, shall accuse; They, who immovably do think to stand, Shall fall, without the motion of a hand; And when the things they fear'd, cannot annoy them That, which they sleight, and fear not, shall destroy them. Exceeding dreadful, during such probations, Will be the many suff'rings of these Nations, Except those days be short'ned, or GOD, shall Enable to sustain what may be fall. For, that, which now is coming to the Test, Is not, alone, the peoples interest, As, what was lately controverted here Betwixt them, and deceased Oliver; Or, him and Stewart: or, a thing so vain As now, the Dane and Swede, or France &amp; Spain Are striving for: But, whether good or evil; CHRIST, or the Man of Sin, GOD, or the Devil Shall have the Soveraignty; and wo to those Who shall, that righteous interest oppose, Which is to be decided, when the day Shall come, to set their battels in aray. But, 'tis already come; at least, so nigh As to be seen by Contemplations eye. Tis come; and, (though not, as 'tis misconceiv'd By those, who have a Throne for CHRIST contriv'd, As carnal as that is, which now must fall) It will ere long, be visible to all, Who have that eye-salve, which may help their eyes, To see Truth shining through dark mysteries. The Banners, of both Parties are display'd; Both their Militia's, are in part aray'd; The souldiers wages, on both sides is known, The secret word, on many is bestown: And, not one Promise doth to me appear Of an escape, from that, which men may fear, Save, as in their Probations, they make good Their charge, (though to the loosing of their blood If need require) with trusting to that grace, Which, neither Is, nor shall be, nor ev'r was To any wanting, who did not refuse it, Nor when it is received, shall abuse it. But, what will follow, can alone be known To them, on whom that grace shall be bestown; Or, by th'Events, of those Contingencies, VVhich from a just progression, will arise; And, must, the steps-probationary be To that, which is GOD's absolute Decree; For, whose accomplishment, I will attend Till that time comes, or, till my life shall end. Here, I had ended; but it fares with me As with him, who, again shall never see Those he departs from; and would leave behind him, Somewhat, to make them, otherwhile to minde him. Thus, would I do; or, rather, if I may Make others minde themselves; &amp; what this day Seems drawing nigh. Oh, let him, with regard, That speaks for you, (not for himself) be heard. Let him, Oh Englands Representative, Who, now, hath but a little time to live, (And, fain would write, or say, before he dies, That, for thy Weal, which thou shouldst not despise) Let him this once be heard, with that respect Which may produce a rational effect, Lest, all thy Consultations, Cost and Pain, Do prove at last, to be bestow'd in vain. To him, who to your selves, did you restore, Your selves resign, more now, then heretofore; And, seek not, like your tyrannizing Kings, At this time, to contrive and settle things More for your selves, then to advantage those Who, trust in you, for better ends repose; Or, to advance your Freedoms, more then their Just Rights, for whose sake, they conferred are. Let not him, suffer more, who shall accuse For breach of trust, then they who trust abuse, As heretofore: For, there was once a time Wherein, to charge a Member, for a crime, Was prosecuted with a greatet zeal Then his Guilt, who, then wrong'd the Commonweal: Ev'n when to Stangate, yea, (some say) well nigh To Lambeth-house, the People heard them cry, 'Tis for a MEMBER: and preserv'd was he VVithin that House, who ought expel'd to be: And, all the mercy, to th'Accuser shown, VVas, to be kept a Pris'ner in his own. But they who did it, were by Providence Cast out; GOD keep all such, for ever thence. Consider whether there do not, as yet To your own knowledge, men among you sit VVho much obstruct the mercies, GOD intends, And, your progression in those righteous ends VVhich you propose. (I mean not any one VVho erres through humane Frailty; For, then none Should be excus'd) but such as do transgress Through Envy, and malitious wilfulness; Or such Presumers, who, as Achan did, Took Gold &amp; rayment (things, that were forbid, On danger of a Curse) such as bereave The poor of their subsistence; or deceive The Commonwealth; and whom their Avarice To other things unlawful did intice, VVhereby oppressed Innocents are wrong'd, And Justice to their ruine, is prolong'd. Consider, what may be the sad event VVhere any such as these, are prevalent; And, if you find such, and desire to thrive, To them, in time, their due demerits give; For, why, by palliating of their guilt, Should your blood, like the Benjamites be spilt, VVho brought on their whole Tribe, a wrath divine, For murth'ring but one Levites Concubine? Consider, when your Pardons were bestown, VVhether it were not for ends of your own; More to secure your selves, or to befriend The Nations Foes, who on your Grace depend; Or, otherwhile, because, you durst not do That Justice, which you were oblig'd unto, Much rather, then sincerely to express Your love to mercy, and to righteousness: If so, you finde it; then, betimes lament Your failings, and effectually repent. Consider, if, when we, to pacifie The wrath of GOD, a day shall sanctifie In Fastings, or Thanksgivings; whether, he Can pleased with those sacrifices be, Which cost us, nothing, but to spend a day, (And formally, to pass some hours away) In Emptiness, or Fulness; or, to hear Those sins reprov'd, which, we will not forbear; Yet, not to leave behind us, till the morrow, One symptome, of true thankfulness, or sorrow? Had it not then been fit, to lay aside Some part of what, in Vanity and Pride Hath been consum'd; their sufferings to relieve, VVho cannot from the Publick purse receive VVhat is their due, until GOD shall restore Abilities, to make that Pittance more? Consider, (since among you there are some, VVho, do believe, a Kingdome is to come, VVhereof CHRIST must be King) whether or no Your Government, should not be modell'd so; That, when the People, shall Elect by Voyce Double Trustees; GOD should by lot make choyce Of which him pleaseth? VVhen that we have had Our Option, wherefore should not His be made? So 'twas, when Isr'el, first a King enjoy'd, And, when the first Apostleship was voyd. Who would not be content to stand or fall VVith what, would so indifferent be to all? Or, not submit to him, who will become, Do what we can, the Giver of our Doom? Or, who will this oppose, but they who doubt GOD, will in his Elections, leave them out? More might be said: But, you know how to draw The Body of a Lyon, by the Paw. If, these things, you consider; and shall do, Your best endeavour to conform thereto, This, I am sure of, (though I cannot tell VVhat will be done) that, all they, shall do well VVhose Consciences, unfeignedly attest That, they, to do all well, have done their best. How pleasing, this will prove, well know I not; But, how I might have pleased, well I wot. If, I, had flattered those men in their waies, VVho, whatsoev'r they merit, look for praise. If, Pillows to their Elbowes I had sow'd, Sooth'd up the Covetous, fawn'd on the Proud, And been like many other, so ripe-witted, My Poems with their humours to have fitted: Had I, another been, not he I am, None knowing what I was, or, whence I came; Then, had (as I did) thirty years ago, Foretold what should be, and, what see they do Accordingly fufill'd; and then, had got By that success, (which often faileth not) Amongst the People, such a reputation, As they, who seem to speak by Revelation; It may be I had been a Saint esteem'd As Madmen are in Turky; or, now seem'd Less despicable; or, else, my predictions Had been as well regarded as those Fictions. Or foolish lying Prophesies, by which Impostors, this deluded age bewitch. If, I, on that advantage, had made known Some Crotchets or Chimera's of mine own, For selfish ends; or, had I then pretended To some new-light; such Novelties commended To his age, as are pleasing, at this day. Or had I, (which, I could, as well as they VVho practise it) put on the tempting Dress Of seeming zeal, and formal-holiness; Forborn to speak, what few men love to hear; Not bid them leave, what no man can forbear; And, in those things complide which most affect; I might have been the Father of some Sect: Yea, so, should have been favoured perchance, As to have got some temporal advance: For, few men, (could my heart therewith comply) Had better means, for such a cheat, then I. But, these were not my Aims, &amp; I have gain'd As much, as I had hope to have attain'd. And, having fully prov'd what is in men, VVill henceforth lay by, my displeasing Pen: Not doubting, but this Letter, will effect As much as whilst I live, I must expect. I, now have writ enough, to that intent VVhich first I had; yea, much more then I ment VVhen I began, this; and thereby make known A Cause, more worthy heeding, then mine own; Wherein, if I prevail hereby, no more Then, by what I have written heretofore, I, shall believe th'effect would be much less Hereafter, should I, any more express. The Preface last year to my SALT on SALT, Fore-warned (and I think it not my fault If none regard it) that, to us, this year Effects of dreadful Thunders, would appear; And, so it comes to pass: yet, little heeded, Save as things, which have casually succeeded: I'll therefore, henceforth let them credit give To what they dream, and I do not believe. Enough is here writ, to make most of those That shall be Knaves, or Fools, to be my Foes. And, where can I live, (unless God shall please) Where, I can long be safe from some of these? But, in their presence, he my Table spreads; My Soul, nor their Power, nor their Malice dreads; He, heretofore, hath me defended from Their Purposes, and will, for, time to come, In that which most concerns me; though men may Take Life, Estate, and outward things, away. I have already said, and writ enough, For men prophane, and Hypocrites to scoff: Therefore, henceforth, let each man do the thing That likes him, as when Isr'el had no king. Let him, that will be wilful, have his will: Let him that's filthy, so continue still, Until another, to supply my room, Shall with a more prevailing Spirit come. Look to thy self, Oh BRITAIN! I will here No more be thy despis'd REMEMBRANCER: For, as those, who (when they neglects did meet, Were bid, to shake the dust from off their feet) I, am excus'd; and, 'tis not my belief, That, I am bound to preach unto the Deaf, And cast away my Pearls, as I have done, Where they and I, shall still be trampled on. My Soul, is clear from any blood of thine; GOD grant, thou mayst as guiltless be of mine, Thine own, and other mens; and at thy need, Speed better, in thy suits, then yet I speed. I will no more, affright thee with Alarms By my Predictions, of approaching harms, As in times past, nor add to thy offence, By minding thee, of thine impenitence; Nor seem to play the Fool, to make those wise Who, will not see, wherein their safety lies: But, cease to meddle in those Publick-matters, Which, thy False Prophets, and Prognosticaters, Have puzzell'd: But, to him, a suitor be, VVho, from what's threatned, can deliver thee. To works of this kind, here, I fix a bound, This, is the last time, wherein I will sound My Trumpet to these Nations; or make known Ought which concerns thy matters, or mine own In publick wise, or, in a private way, Save, as my Neighbours, either do, or may; Unless, I, from within, have such a Call As cannot safely be dispens'd withal: Or, else, an outward Call from those who may Command me, if they think, that I can say VVhat to the Publick welfare will relate: But, there is little likelyhood of that; And, therefore, I intend to spare my breath, To vent my Thoughts in private till my death. Oh that I fail not, of my expectations, (In this dark Den, of cruel habitations, By outward or by inward perturbations) To take thy Kingdom, (wherein, at this day, Thine enemies and mine, the Tyrants play) COME, come, LORD JESU, quickly come away. EPIPHONEMA. The more, I muse, the more I may, Till night, ends in eternal day: For, ev'ry hour, brings forth new things, From whence, new matter dayly springs, Whereof, I shall but speak in vain, Whilst my Corruptions do remain: But, when I must depart to Him, Who nor begun, nor ends in Time, And, hence, quite out of sight, am gone, My words will more be thought upon. Or they (when recknings are set right) Will help make measure and full weight. Ensuing times, will useful make them, Tho I, (in scoff, call'd Prophet) spake them: And, when of nothing, I have need, They, paradventure, or their seed, Who in my life-time, have undone me, Will (dead) bestow a Grave upon me; As they that (issuing from their wombs Who slew them) built the Prophets tombs. VERSES Intended to the King's Majesty, BY Major GEORGE WITHER, Whilst he was Prisoner in NEVVGATE: Which being found Written with his own Hand, among his loose Papers, since his Commitment close Prisoner to the TOVVER, Are now Published, as pertinent both to his Majesty, and to Him. Sir, though I neither of your Grace despair, Nor lack sufficient Faith, to make a Prayr In Court: yet, wanting means to prosecute, I'le trouble you at this time, with no Suit; But, treat of somewhat, that no more will cost, Save Labour, which I many times have lost, And, thereby, not been made a jot the worse, Either in mind, in body, or in purse. When Rebels did King Davids flight constrain, And, GOD was pleas'd to bring him home again, They, who to drive him out, had forwardst been, Made hast to joyn with those who brought him in. And, he, with GOD, in Mercy so comply'd, That, not one man for that Rebellion dy'd, VVho follow'd Absalom, that had contriv'd The Treason, and well-meaning men deceiv'd. A traitrous Child's life, that Rebellion cost; But, by our War, a Fathers life was lost: And therfore, though some bloodshed that produc'd, In humane Reason you may be excus'd, VVhom natural Affection mov'd to shed The blood of some, by whom your Father bled; Since you more Mercy freely have bestown Than Davids, or your Foll'wers would have shown. Which much augments your Honour: For, no Jem So beautifies a Royal Diadem, As Mercy, when it is enameled VVith Justice, and with Prudence riveted. I had presum'd a personal Address Long since; but, difficult is an Access For such as I appear, who hazard blame, And disrespect enough, where I now am; Because, what Conscience chargeth me withal, Is by some judged to be criminal. In that regard, this Paper must make way For gaining an admittance, as it may; And will, I hope, presented be, by some VVho shall have entrance, where I cannot come. I am despoiled so of ev'ry thing, That nothing for a Present I can bring Except (of Grace) your Majesty shall please To daign acceptance to such Gifts as these; Which (though but mean, and in an homly dress) VVill then illustrate your true Worthiness, As amply, as the candid Acceptation, Of what may seem of greater valuation. I cannot write strong Lines, with swelling words, VVhose Elegancy scarcely room affords For sober sense; nor muster up their Names, Whom History, and whom Tradition fames For brav'st Atchievements, since time first begun, And then say, you have all of them outgone; As if my foolish words, might add unto Your Honour, more than your own Deeds can do. Or, as if any Wise-man would give creed To what they in a flatring Poem reade. It is not in the pow'r of any other By Pen or Tongue to clear up, or to smother Your true Deserts; For, in your self that lies, VVhich either them beclouds, or dignifies. No other Thoughts I entertain of You, But such as I may think, and you allow: Yet, to extol your Worth I shall not dare, Till I know truly what your Vertues are. For, though to Flatrers all Kings seem to be Of like desert, they seem not so to me. I'le serve you faithfully in what I may, And, as my King, love, honour and obey. I would conceal, not publish your defects, If I knew any; and give due respects To all your Merits; but, I will not own One Line that praises them, till they are known: For, till I know, I give but what is due, I am a Lyar, though my words be true; Since equally, both good and evil things, Are famed of the best of men, and Kings. A Stranger likewise, you have been long time To most of your own Subjects in this Clime, And, I was never where I did behold Your face, since you were two or three years old: VVhat Good soever therefore I aver Of you, I shall but seem a Flatterer; Yea, you your self would think so, should I add Those Virtues, which you know you never had; And, Praise, which is ascrib'd to any one In that mode, is a little less than none. But, little Credit also hath a Poet, To celebrate your Worth, when he shall know it, Or counterpoize, or silence Contradictions, Since most esteem his Writings to be Fictions; And you will be more honor'd, than in them, By these blunt Lines, if they have your esteem. I therefore, so shall study to increase Your Honour, that I may not make it less; And whatsoever I can say or do, (Although you give a Countermand thereto) I'le say, and do it; when I shall be sure Your Life, or Peace, or Honour 'twill secure: And, if this be a fault, I do intend To be thus faulty, till my life shall end. I know, most Royal Sir, who 'tis that saies, Et magnis placuisse Viris, non ultima laus est. Hor. de Arte Poetica. To please great men, deserves not meanest praise: I see how 'tis approv'd, and what they gain Who can that thriving Faculty attain. Yet, I shall wave their Art, and will assay To do you honour in another way, By giving you occasion to express Your Justice, Mercy, and your Prudentness; So that your self may make the world to see Your Virtues more, than words can say they be. To that end, much might in my case be shown: But, rather for your sake, than for mine own Is this Address; Yea, rather to prevent What may be your harm, than my detriment; Ile therefore wave that too; that no self-end May frustrate what I chiefly do intend. Some, questionless, before your Restoration Contributed for your Accommodation In true sincerity; and some, no doubt, Thereby to work their own Salvation out; And many a one, perhaps, like Ziba speed, VVho merited no better than he did. Some other would have done as much as they, But, neither had the means, nor knew the way; And many, who against You then combin'd, Are now, so truly of another mind, That, you in them are safe: for, Love in such Will much abound, who were forgiven much. I, who obeyed late preceding Pow'rs Compulsively; now, willingly to yours Profess Allegiance; and, as true as those Will be, who of their Truth make fairest shows. For, when I saw GOD on your side appear, I was reclaim'd by Conscience, not by Fear; Yea, I foresaw, and likewise did foretel (To them who were in pow'r) what since befell; Attending passively, what I expected, By Providence divine would be effected: And my professed Loyalty to you Is not alone unquestionably true, But also, may appear to be more free From self-ends, than their Loyalty can be In whom you most confide: For, they from Bands Exempted are; have Honours, Goods and Lands, Pensions or Offices, wherein you do Protect them; and, they have your Favour too. But, all these wholly are to me destroy'd, And I by your Protection have enjoy'd Nought, save a dying-life, a living-grave, Or that, whereof so small esteem I have, That, if my Work were done, and GOD would say Amen, I would resign my Life this day. Yet, so far am I from repining at My Portion, or my seeming sad estate, That, in this Posture I will serve as long, As to endure it GOD shall make me strong; Not doubting, but when all things come to proof, My Suffrings will be much to my behoof: Mean time, left otherwise, my good intent To you, some causualty may prevent, I will, so far forth as my Chain will stretch, (And mine now shortned arm and hand will reach) Exhibit such Expedients, as from Time, And other Herbs, I've suckt within your Clime; And, wanting better Gifts, will offer you This little Cluster of those Grapes, which grew Upon my wither'd Vine: For, though they are But sowre, your Kingdom yeelds none wholsomer, If you shall seasonably press out the Juice, And then assume it without prejudice. This Time is critical; The wayes be ruff, And many of those Chariot-wheels fly off, By which your Marches expedited seem'd, And lost Advantages must be redeem'd, Lest when you think that they are come to hand, Your main Expectances be at a stand, Or, put so far back, that you may survive Your hopes, and your own happiness outlive. I wish it otherwise; and know it may Be as I wish, if you the means assay, Not giving ear to those, who will withstand Your Good, &amp; that which GOD hath now in hand. I have discharg'd my Conscience; and so shall, VVhatever for so doing doth befall, In hope that will not wholly be dispis'd, Which now shall be in faithfulness advis'd. To those men do not over-much adhere, Who think all Wisdom lies within their sphear; For, Honours, Riches, and self-Interest Have made wise-men as brutish as a Beast. Heed otherwhile, what Common Fame doth say. Aswel as what your Courtiers whisper may; Lest you be ignorant of many things, Whose cognizance is pertinent to Kings. Make no man your chief Confident, but he That's both discreet, and honest known to be; Lest he deceives your trust, and in the close Destroyes your old Friends, or begets new Foes. Let Justice be your Scepter, let your Crown Be Mercy; and, if you would keep your own, Give that to others, which to them belongs, And free the Poor and Fatherless from wrongs: Especially, your main Endeavours bend To make and keep your Sov'reign Lord your friend. And if you would be setled on your Throne, Take care that His usurped be by none. Enjoy your Conscience, whatsoere it be; So other men may have their Conscience free; And, hang me for a Traitor, if thereby You then enjoy not more Security, Than what your Strength by Sea and Land now gives, And all that humane Policy contrives. Let Truth and Error fight it out together, Whilst Civil Peace disturbed is by neither; Which may be so provided for, that none Shall justly be displeas'd with what is done; Nor you hereafter be (for evermore) Disturbed, as you have been heretofore. If You neglect this, and I disobey, Twill be with much grief, and no other way, But only passively, and whatsoever I suffer, will your Welfare still endeavour. To be of this mind, thousands are believ'd, VVho are not into favour yet receiv'd: And whilst they are excluded (though in peace They live) suspitions daily will encrease; And from their Malice, who nor GOD, nor King, Much care for, some ill consequence may spring, By which You may have trouble, and they blame, VVho shall be no way guilty of the same. Your taking timely Opportunities Now offred (and, of what before You lies) May render You a blessed Instrument, In making passage to that Government VVhich Tyrants fear; more glorious make Your Throne Than ever any King yet sate upon: And make Your Name a terror to all those VVho to that Kingdom shall continue Foes. Herein I've spoke according to my creed, Wishing my just hopes may thereon succeed; And that upon Your heart it may work more, Than what I've spoke to others heretofore. But GOD's time is at hand; within his pow'r Are all mens ways; yea, both your hearts &amp; our; And I will patiently subject unto VVhat either He or You shall please to do, Not asking (whatsoere I seem to want) Ought more, than you spontaneously shall grant: For, what I may expect, if you denie, So far as need shall be, GOD will supply. These words, when I was young, my Motto were, I neither have, nor want, nor do I care: So are they now I'm old; yea, somewhat more Essentially than ever heretofore; And thereof I will not abate one Letter, Till GOD and You dirrect me to a better. The Liberty I covet to enjoy, Is that which no man living can destroy. The Wealth I aim at, is nor less, nor more, But to be well contented, Rich or poor: And, if I had a mind my Wits to strain, That I to earthly Honours might attain, I should to no such common heights aspire, As now are objects of most mens desire; Or, to a stile of so mean consequence, As is an Earl, a Marquess, Duke or Prince; Or, to be call'd your Cousin: For, no less VVould satisfie my large Ambitiousness, But so much worth, at least, as did commend His Loyalty, whom David call'd his Friend, And wit enough to make a parallel Of ev'ry Traytor, with Achithophel. For, then you should in very short time see, That no man more deserves esteem'd to be Your Majesties loyal Subject Than, Geo. Wither. Newgate, Mar. 22. 1662. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECOND COLLECTION Vox Pacifica: A VOICE TENDING TO The Pacification of God's wrath; and offering those Propositions, or Conditions, by the acceptation, and performance whereof, in some good measure, a firme and continuing Peace may be obtained. It is directed to the King, Parliaments, and People of these Islands: BY Geo. Wither Esquire, (a Commander in this War) heretofore their unheeded Remebbrancer of Plagues and Deliverances past; and their timely Forewarner of the Judgments now come. He hath disposed it into six Books, or Canto's, whereof foure onely are contained in this Volumne; and the other deferred to be hereafter published, as there shall be Cause. To day, if you will heare this VOICE, harden not your hearts, &amp;c. The meaning of the Frontispice. A trumpet sounds a parlee to this Isle, And, over it, a Hand displayes, the while, A Flag of Peace; that, this new Signe at doore, May draw you in, to view a little more. We hung it forth, that these besotted Nations May heed the season of their Visitations; And, grow more carefull to conforme their wayes To what this VOICE, and their known Duty, sayes: Though, yet, the most, our words no more have mark'd, Then if a Cat had meaw'd, or Dog had bark'd. You see the building; you have seen the Signe; And, if it pleaseth you, may tast our Wine. You view the Type, and Title, of the Play, Our Argument, and where the Scœne we lay; And, that, for which the Maker dearer paid, May, when you please, for little be survai'd; Ev'n for as little as you thinke it worth, When he, at that low rate, can set it forth: And, that we offer no unwholsome Wares, Our Licence, and our Priviledge, declares. Neglect not courtesies, when few are done; Nor Opportunities, till they are gone: Nor doubt your usage, though abroad you heare, Our Authour, in reproving, is austere: For, they who bring a well-composed minde, In his most harsh reproofs, will mildnesse finde: And, none have been his Adversaries, yet, But, they, who wanted honesty, or wit. When his owne failings have to him appear'd, Himselfe no more then others he hath spar'd; And, did, what, he supposeth, him became. Let ev'ry Reader strive to do the same, And shortly, here, in substance will be seen, What, in this Embleme, hath but shadow'd been. TO THE KING, PARLIAMENTS, AND PEOPLE, OF These British Isles. Not to petition King, or Parliament, Or Court the People, suits with his intent Who sends you this: Nor, is it come to crave Your Favours, or, your Patronage to have. It is almost too late; and 'twas too soon: At this time, therefore, he expects that boone From One who better knowes him; and from whom This VOICE, doth to your sight, and hearing come. And, had he alwaies done so, he had lost Lesse labour; and escaped with lesse cost. He hath no mind to flatter: if he had, To flatter at this time, were to be mad; And, peradventure, also, he hath, now, As little cause, as mind, to flatter you: For, Courtship on that LADY who bestowes That poore, despis'd, deform'd and aged growes, Who sleighted him, and left him to dispaire When she was wealthie, lovely, young, and faire. Yet, that those old affections may appeare, With which, by him, you alway served were; And, that he may not give a just offence (By seeming carelesse of the reverence Belonging to your Greatnesse) he professes, That, meerly, for the sake of these Expresses, The freedome of bold-language he assumes; And, that he nothing, for himselfe, presumes: Nor, means to honour, love, or serve you, lesse, For your unkindnesses, or your distresse. The Newes he brings, accepted if it be, Will warrantize the Speaker to be free: And, if it be despised, he conceives, Some will grow bold, ere long, without your leaves; And, make you heare, with ruder complements, A blunter Language, and to worse intents: For, dreadfull things are murmur'd; and unlesse Men more conforme, to that which they professe, You'l find, ere long, he dareth, without feare, To speak more truth, then many dare to heare. What ever He, what e're his Language seems; Your Persons, none more values, or esteems. None loves your Honours, or your safeties, more Then he yet doth, and hath done heretofore. None, oft'ner his own blame hath ventur'd on, That others might not wholly be undone; Or, is more free from aimes, at that which tends To personall respects, or private ends. And, thus professeth he, that you might grow More honourable, by believing so. He, that hath done GOD'S errand, was, ere now, Reputed a 2 King. 9. 11. Mad-fellow: Some, of you, Have so been pleas'd, perhaps, of him to say, Because he hath appear'd in such a way, As, never, since the Christian-paths, were trod, Was traced, by a Messenger from GOD. But, times have been; and, this is such a time, In which the People, much regard not them Who speak in Ordinary: And, then must Some Ploughman, or some Herdman, forth be thrust To help awake them; and, He, peradventure, With Riddles, Signes, or Parables, must enter; Or, els, by some unusuall straines proceed, To make his Hearers give the better heed; And, know, the Spirit stoupeth from on high, Somtime, ev'n with a vulgar 2 King. 3. 15. Minstralsie. Be pleased, therefore, not to under-prize Him, or his Present; lest (when his disguise Is taken off) you find him somwhat els Then you have thought, or his appearance tels. Permit you not the crafty Polititians In either Faction, to beget suspitions, That, he, who wrote this VOICE, hath some Intents, For compassing whereof, he, now, invents A Fancie, and pretends the publike-Peace, When, really, he aimes at nothing lesse. For, that his purposes, no other were Then he professeth, plainly shall appeare To men of ingenuity, or wit, Who weigh things past, with what he, now, hath writ. For, whosoe're hath observation took, With what impartiall-freedome he hath spoke To either side, (nor sparing Friend, nor Foe; Nor caring, who displeas'd, or pleas'd shall grow) Can never draw that false conclusion thence, Without much folly, or much impudence. Yea, since it is apparent, that his Pen Hath spar'd himselfe, no more then other men; Since he hath, now, nigh five and thirty years, This Freedome used; and nought, yet, appears To be, thereby, acquir'd, but sad events, Disgraces, losses, close imprisonments, Despights and mischiefs; how can you suppose His folly such, that, now, the world worse growes, He thinks, this course will him advantage more, Or, bring him fewer mischiefs, then before? He knowes, there is the selfe-same basenesse, yet, The same corruption, the same little wit, And malice, which in former times was here; Though, now, in other habits they appeare, And act another way. He knowes, what then Best pleas'd; and, what will, now: yet, takes agen The selfe-same Course: Because, he knowes from whom His messages, and warranties do come: And, that it shall be more his reputation, To be undone, by such a Generation, For doing of his Dutie; then, therby, To be advanc'd for furth'ring vanitie, Till he and they into perdition fall, Like Sheep, or Bullocks, slaught'red in their stall. This, hath so steel'd him, that he can abide, To heare a foolish-Gallant him deride, And (taking up his Poem) grin, and say; Come, let us heare what novelties we may Collect from this New-Prophet? and behold, What future things, are here, by him, fore-told? This, makes him bold, and resolute, for you; Who, for himselfe, doth bashfully pursue The meanest favour, while you seeme to see Another, who thereof may worthier be. And, therefore, now, this one time him regard, For your owne sakes, though never afterward. Be warie, that this VOICE you truly heed, Before to any censure, you proceed, Condemning it, or him, by whom it came; Lest you, your selves, incurre the greatest blame: And, thereupon, this also, may ensue; That, thousands for that censure, censure you, When they perceive, that you a course have run, Whereby, you are dishonour'd, and undone. And, to this end; of those, who cause have bin Of all your present Plagues, and of that sin, Which brought them on you (that two-horned-Beast) Beware of: yea, be warie that no Priest, Of either side, make void what this VOICE tels, By their prejudicating it: Or els, By showes of Learning, or fain'd Holinesse, Make you beleeve, that this way to expresse Divine concernments: Or, for Saints, to use The Muses language, some way doth abuse Their Sanctitie: Or, that this way of Preaching, Is Heath'nish, and a Pagan-straine of teaching. For, though most Poets were, long time ago, (And yet are) Priests of Lust, and Drunkennesse, They, from their first beginning, were not so; But, men inspir'd divinely, to expresse The will of GOD; and, by their holy Songs, To rouze up that affection in the heart, Which to the Love of Pietie belongs; And, to encline it to the better-part. At this our Author aimes; and, to restore That Gift, to what it hath been heretofore, His Muses consecrates: and, shewes the way, That, others (if it please them) follow may. Permit not then, the rigidnesse of those, Who think Divinitie confin'd to prose; And, Verse ordain'd, at first, for nothing els But, carnall fancies, foolish charms, and spels: Oh! suffer none of those (who have beside Their ignorance, much envie, and much pride) Your judgements to pervert, divert your eyes, Or, fill your eares, with vanities and lies, To keep off your attention, from this VOICE, By juggling with Formalities, and noyse; Both to the prolongation of your woe, And, losse of good effects which thence may flow. For, if this VOICE be welcome to your eare, The blessed way of Peace, it shall prepare: And by the Charmings of this new-tun'd Song The rage of War, shall be allaid e're long. That wicked Spirit shall be charmed downe, By whom, the seeds of discords, have beene sowne: The Hags and Furies, that have danced here, No longer, to affright you, shall appeare: But, all the sacred vertues, and the graces, Shall beautifie your Desolated-places. If you contemne this VOICE, what e're you deem, Of that it speaketh, (or, what e're he seem, Who now proclaimes it) GOD shall spread the same, In spight of all detractions, to your shame, And to the honour of that Instrument, By whom it comes: yea, as a Monument, Ev'n you, (and yours, who sleight it) shall preserve it From being lost; your closets shall reserve it, To bear a Testimoniall of your crimes, And your impenitence, to future times: Or, for a warning, to some age to come; Or, to exalt GODS Justice in your doome: The least of which, will yeeld a rich returne For all his paines, though you his labour scorne. Should you despise these counsels, it will shew So plainly, those events which must ensue, That, he shall neither value those respects The world affords, nor care for her neglects: But (your sad doomes bewailing) shall desire, That, he and his, may speedily retire To that safe resting-place, wherein are found Sure shelters, from those plagues, that will abound: And, where he never more shall feel, or heare The scornes of pride, the rage of malice feare: Or, labour, as he hath done, heretofore, To make a White-man of a Blackamoore. But, yet he hopes; and yet, a while expects Some other, and more suitable effects, To his desires: which (if they should succeed Accordingly, will bring him, or, his seed, To see (forth of these Fires) that Phœnix rise, Which, is the chiefe desire, of all their eyes, Who love Ierusalem. And, with this hope, His heart, he comforting, here, makes a stop; And signifies, that, He, who doth preferre This VOICE, is your despis'd REMEMBRANCER. Geo. Wither. A Postscript. Be pleas'd to know, that, though our Author gives, In these four Canto's, fretting Corosives, He taketh no contentment in your smart; But, studies to perform that Leaches part, Who, rather, seekes his patients life to save, Then, how to flatter him into his grave. If you (with patience) let this Plaister lie, The next that he intendeth to apply, Shall be a Balsome, which will cure and ease; And (if you be not verie hard to please) Give proofe (what ever, knaves and fooles pretend) Why, ev'ry honest man, should be his friend. The Contents of the severall Canto's contained in this Volumne. The Contents of the first Canto. First, here is to your view prefer'd When, where, and how this VOICE was heard: What kind of Muzings, were the ground: What worlds, and wonders, may be found Within our selves: what safe-Retreats From those oppressions, frauds, and baits Which are without: how little feare Of Terrours, which affright us here: How plainly, there, a man may see The villanies, that acted be For private ends, with publike showes: How generall the mischiefe growes: Why, to acquaint you with this VOICE, GOD, by so meane a man, makes choice: Then, shewes how our grand-hopes deceive us, And, prayes his aid, that must relieve us. The Contents of the second Canto. This Canto's Preface being done, The VOICE, to these effects, goes on; Tells, how unworthy we are, yet, For Peace desired, how unfit: How vain, how harmfull Treaties be, Till both Sides, in one Third agree; And (laying by ignoble ends) Vse likely meanes of being Friends. Shewes, that the Peace which most pursue, Will be nor permanent, nor true. Then, that some Cures may be appli'd, Declares, which Parts are putrifi'd; Which, must be purg'd, without delay; Or, cauteriz'd, or cut away, If we will, e're it be too late, Recure this weake, this dying State. The Contents of the third Canto. Here, whether you be pleas'd, or no, This Author, maketh bold to show That Portion of his private wrongs, Whose knowledge, and redresse, belongs To Publike Justice; that, her eye May through his wounds, her own espie. The VOCE, then speakes again, and schooles, In Him, all other froward-Fooles, Who, with impatiencie do vent Their private wrongs, or discontent: As if their Trifles could be heard, When Kingdomes cannot finde regard. It shewes, our Senate blamelesse are, Of those Distractions, raging here; And, where the Fault, and Fountaine lies, From whence, our present plagues arise. The Contents of the fourth Canto. While here, our Authour doth recite His Muzings after Naesby fight, The VOICE returnes; and, doth begin To shew us, what must usher in Exiled Peace. Then, told are we, How kept our Vowes, and Covenants be: How we reforme, and fast, and pray: What Thankfulnesse we do repay: What, must in generall be done; What, by each Individuall-One: What course both King and State must take, E're they their Peace with GOD shall make: What he expects, from ev'ry Nation, From ev'ry Town, and Corporation, And ev'ry House, in some degree, Before our Peace renew'd will be. These faults are discovered in the printing, which the Reader is desired to mend with his pen, and to pardon such other as are over-seene. VOX PACIFICA: OR, A Voice preparing the way of Peace: AND, To that end, dedicated to the King, Parliaments and People of these British Isles. [The first Canto.] I who (before my Harp was tun'd or strung) Began to play a descant on the Times, And was among the first of those that sung The scorn and shame of VICE, in English Rymes. I, that have, now, just halfe the Age of Man, Been slashing at those Hydra's heads of sin, Which are, yet, more then when I first began; And more deformed growne, then they have bin, I, that have spoke of Truth, till few believe it; Of taking heed, till Follie hath her doome; Of Good-advice, till no man will receive it; And, of Deserved-Plagues, till they are come: Once more appeare, with an intent, to say A needfull Word in season, if I may. The Sun hath run his course through all the Signes, And, thirteen times the Moone renew'd her light, Since last I limb'd my thoughts in measur'd lines, Or, felt my heart for Numbers tun'd aright; For, ever since my Musings in the Field, The close whereof, a Voice of PEACE fore-tells, With such disord'red thoughts I have been fild As use to thrive where sad distemper dwells: And, we have, All, so broken that Condition, On which our wished Comforts founded are, That, of accomplishing our hopes fruition, Not many certaine symptomes, yet, appear; Though, therefore, I have silent been till now, My slownesse blame not, neither murmure you. The Muses are not still at my command, Whereby those Informations are acquir'd, Which many have expected at my hand; (And somwhat out of season too, desir'd.) The VOICE, there mentioned, was but a Sound, Not then, articulated into words; The perfect Forme thereof I had not found, Nor what interpretation it affords. If I had spoken, e're I had mine Arrant, Beyond my wit, my forward tongue had went; If I had run, before I had my Warrant, Well might I, for my labour, have been shent. There is, for all things an appointed houre; And, Times, and Seasons, are not in my power. My Vessell stirreth not, till that Wind blowes Which never blowes but when, and where it list: Drie is my Cisterne, till that Fountain flowes, Whose flowings-forth, I cannot then resist. Somtimes, in me, so low the Waters lie, That every Childe and Beast is trampling on me; Somtime againe, they rise, they swell so high, That Princes cannot make a Bridge upon me. Had King, and Parliament, the other day, Commanded from me that which now I write, To save my life, I knew not what to say Of that, which was inspired yesternight: And, being, now, as full as I can hold, Though none they please, my Musings must be told. Mistake not tho, as if it should be thought, That by Enthusiasme, now, I write; Or, that the matter which to me is brought, By GODS immediate dictates, I indite. Far is that Arrogancie from my Pen: The Objects of my Contemplation, be The same which GOD affords to other men, Who use aright, the Guifts bestow'd on me. The Muses challenge a peculiar phrase And freedomes, not so well becoming those, Who are confined to observe the lawes Of common speech, and tell their minds in prose: For, whereas these have but one worke to do, I have, in my Intentions, often two. To reason out a Truth, is their perfection; That, so, mens judgements rectifie they might: Thereat, I aime: But, how to move Affection, And set the motions of the Will aright, Is my chiefe work: And; to that end, I catch At all advantages of Place and Time, Of Actions, or Expressions; and, I watch For ev'ry meanes of well improving them. By which endeavours (and, for ought I know, By some aid, more then ordinary too) Mixt with mine own Conjectures, I fore-show Some things, which GOD requires, or means to do. And, when I apprehend such things as these, They neither are conceall'd, nor told with ease. As when a portion of new spritly-wine, Is in a close, and crazie Vessell pent, Which neither can sufficiently confine The working Liquor, nor well give it vent; Ev'n so I far'd: For, (though I felt my breast With matter fully stor'd) seaven daies I strove My swelling Thoughts, in Words, to have exprest, Yet neither could desist, nor forward move. But, on that night in which our Monethly-Fast Had swallow'd up our greatest Festivall, My Muse broke loose: And, now the stop is past, Will run her Course, what ever may befall; And (since to speak her mind she hath begun) Resolves, She will be heard, e're She hath done. Once more therefore, yee BRITAINS lend an eare; KING, PRIEST, &amp; PEOPLE mark what now I say, And, if you shall be pleas'd this VOICE to heare, Take heed, you harden not your hearts to day. For, if your pride, and follie, shall despise The gentle VOICE, that now salutes your eare, Ere long, there shall another VOICE arise, Which will not such a peacefull note preferre. It shall not move with so becalm'd a Breath, Nor be dilated through so milde an ayre, But, from the wombe of Hell, and Jawes of Death, Be thund'red forth, with horrours and despaire: And, few shall hear that VOICES dreadfull sound, Without a smarting, and a curelesse wound. Though you my former Warnings did abuse, It brookes excuse: Because, I so fore-told Ensuing things, as yet, no Moderne-Muse Hath done the like; and few in times of old: But, now, by seeing those Predictions true, You, as it were, an Earnest have receiv'd, And an assurance, tendred unto you, That, what is here declar'd, may be believ'd. By vertue, therefore, of that Seal, and Signe, I challenge that beleefe, and that respect, Which appertaineth to this VOICE of mine, Till, thence, I seeke to draw some ill effect; By making that, which hath fulfilled bin, An Argument to warrantize a sin. If an advantage I shall take from thence, To tempt, from any duty to be done; To act, what gives the Deitie offence, Or any unbeseeming Course to run; Let me be censur'd as Impostors ought, That woo the world, by seeking Heaven in show: Or as a man that's by delusion taught, To take more paines for Hell, then others do. But, if this VOICE, by Truth shall stand approv'd, And by your Consciences allowed be; Resist not that, whereto you shall be mov'd, Nor of my Hopes, at this time, hinder me: For, in their prosecution, I'le proceed, How e're you practice, or how ere I speed. The twentieth year, tenth moneth, and sixteenth day, With carefull thoughts, and thoughtfull heart opprest, Near to the fruitfull Banks of Thame I lay, With waking eyes, whilst others were at rest. It was that day, on which they mournd apart, By whom this Realm hath represented bin; Thereby, instructing ev'ry Single-heart, Which way, the Peace desired, must begin) With private griefs, I had enough to do, To rob my body, and my mind of rest: Yet, I had many publike sorrowes, too, By which, my other suffrings were increast: And, who was ever unafflicted known, That beareth others burdens with his own? Were I but onely rob'd of my estate, And, thereby brought in danger to be poore; Or of such other mischiefs, as of late These warres have brought on me, and many more: Could I no other miseries conceive, Then those, which make our carkasses to smart, Our children crie, our tender women grieve, Or trie the stoutnesse of a manly heart: Were but the outward glories of this Realme, Or of this Church, indanger'd, and no more; Our wounds had needed but a common balme, A sigh or two had blown my sorrowes ore: Because, for shells, but little care I take, Save onely for the precious kernell sake. But, though the happinesse of Realmes and Men, Doth not, alone, in outward things consist; (Nay, rather gaines perfection, now and then, By having some externall blessing mist) Yet, he to his experience little owes, Who sees not, that defect of needfull things, Breeds incivility; and overthrowes That industrie, from whence well-being springs. And, he to our condition is a stranger, Who knowes not, that, by these distractions here, Reformed-Churches are (this day) in danger To suffer, in our suffrings, ev'ry where: And, that, if our confusions we pursue, Meer Barbarisme will (ere long) ensue. Who, can behold the spirit of contention Still active; and, all overtures of Peace Retarded still; or, poysoned with dissention, Yet not bewaile our miseries increase? Or, who laments not? that may feare he carries Within his loynes, the seed of Generations, That may be bred for Romish-Janisaries: And, nursed up in their abhominations? For, though GOD may prevent what we may dread, (And will perhaps) yet none should senslesse grow Of that wherewith our Land is over-spread; Nor of those Plagues, which these may bring us to: But, rather, labour for, by sighes, and teares A publike Freedom from our private Feares. For, who now dreads not, that upon this Age, Worse Plagues are coming, then as yet, we view? And, that the things we suffer, do presage Far greater mischieves, will on those ensue? Loe, that great Festivall, which by this Nation, Was ev'ry yeare observ'd, upon this week, With such magnificent solemnization, That through the world, there hath not been the like: That Festivall, which memoriz'd the birth Of our great Pastor, and (for no small while) Did fill each Temple, and each house with mirth, Through ev'ry Shire, and Village, of this Isle: That Feast into a Fast, our sins now turn; And, where we have triumphed, we now mourn. The Feast of Ashuerus, was to this A petty banquet (if considered In ev'ry circumstance) though great was his, And many people for a long time fed. The Jewish Passover, which did surpasse The most for some respects; in all of them, By our great Festivall, exceeded was, As well in Plenties, as in Place, and Time. For, therein, all Provisions did abound: It was throughout all places, too, extended; With some, it ent'rance in November, found; And not till February, fully ended; But, universally, twelve dayes, at least, Throughout the Land, it was a yearly Feast. That Festivall, (which till it was polluted With Bacchanalian Rites, and Superstition, A pious Observation was reputed) Is now exploded, as a vaine Tradition. Our Triumph-day, by Providence, is come To be the day of our humiliations. The Glorie, now, is quite departed from This Kingdome, for our great abominations. The pleasant things, in which we were delighted, Are took away. The costly trimmings, which To Superstition, Ignorance invited, And which began to cozen, and bewitch, Are broken down; Our brave rich-Robes are gone, And, all of us, have Mourning-Garments on. For our abuse of them, GOD, takes away The chiefe of our Melodious-Instruments; And, they who heretofore did sing and play, Now, sadly sigh; or, howle forth discontents. Our Lutes and Violls, (which were wont to sound Eare-charming straines) are broke and throwne aside: Or, by the noyse of Drums and Cannons drown'd, In whose loud thundrings, terrour doth reside. The Peace, which we supposed everlasting, Is fled away: Our Iubilees are ended: Our Horne of plenty, ev'ry day is wasting, Our Foes are strong, and we are ill befriended: Our fruitlesse hopes, have utterly undone us; The things we feared, are now come upon us. Our many great and unrepented crimes, The Plagues that Sin hath multiplied here; The wilfulnesse and madnesse of the times, So represented to my fancie were, That, through this Island, I (me thought) could see No Worke secur'd from being overthrown; No act, or counsell, from confusion free; No place, that was not metamorphos'd grown: No man, almost, that had not chang'd his mind; No principle, that was not call'd in doubt; No course, in which we might a safetie find; No vertue, in all trials, holding out; Nor any hope of being freed from Our present evils, for the time to come. That Cloud of Plagues, which fill'd in Embleme-wise, The Title-page, of my Remembrancer, (To set before this heedlesse Nations eyes, A glimpse of Judgments, then, approaching near) That horrid-cloud, through all these Iles disperst, Me-thought I view'd; and showring on these Lands, The black effects, which I long since rehearst; And, all the Plagues attending GODS commands. Not only Famine, Pestilence, and Sword, With such, as bring on outward Desolations; But, Plagues appeared also, more abhord By those, who cherish noblest expectations: For, though these harmfull are, more hurt they do, Which murther us in Soule, and Bodie too. I saw so great, so many our Distractions, Such Discords, rising up between the Nations; In ev'rie Shire, in ev'rie Towne such Factions; In ev'rie Person, such dissimulations: Among the Wise, I found so little Reason; So little goodnesse, left among the Best; In fairest shewes of Trust, such reall Treason; And so much Fraud, where Truth was most profest; That, neither want, nor wealth; nor wit, nor Folly; Nor Vice, nor Vertue; Love, nor Hatred, neither, Nor sanctified things, nor things unholy Distinguisht were; but, shuffled so together, That, all things in this world, appear'd, me-thought, Into a Soul-confounding Chaos, brought. Which melancholy Apprehensions rear'd Such crotchets, and such whimsies in my braines; That, many sights, and sounds, I saw and heard, Like those which Feare begets, or Fancie faines: Before me, as a shadow seem'd to passe, Things present, past, and coming; till I saw Quite out of sight, all that which IS, or WAS, And, to an end things Future, also, draw. Strange sounds and noyses, heard I round about me, Or, in me rather; such as did begin From those which rumbled ev'rie day without me, Before a troubled Fancie let them in: Which, though to be uncertaine Sounds, we grant, A Mysterie, not one of them doth want. One while, me thought, Wolves, Foxes, Dogs, &amp; Swine, A greedy, craftie, currish, nastie rabble, Did howle, bark, snarle and grunt; and sometime joyne In consort: Musike most abominable! Sometime, as when an Angrie Lyon roares, Or, as when Thunder breaks out of a cloud, Or, as when raging Billows teare the shoares, I Voyces heard; so shrill, so deep, so loud. I heard, me thought, the Voyce of Desperation, The crying Voyce of Sin, the Voyce of Bloud, The Voyce of Death, and utter Desolation; The Voyce of Iudgement, from an angrie God, And ev'ry Voyce, and ev'ry Cry and Sound, In which amazement, dread, and death is found. Which, had it sounded to an Outward-eare, (As, by my Vnderstanding it was heard) The noyse, had made both dead and living, heare: The Spheres to shake, and Earth, and Hell afeard: The terrour of it, made my Soule to flie Beyond the limits of corporeall things; Sometimes descending, sometimes mounting high, To shun the din, which doubt and horrour brings. But, whatsoever way her course she stear'd, Confused noyse did ev'ry where abound; Confused actions ev'ry where appear'd; Which caus'd my strong distempers to abound: And, almost curelesse, made I my disease, By asking of my heart, such things a these. Why is this World (a Scene of sin and paine) Fill'd full of shadows, which no substance have? A place of time and labour spent in vaine? And where we lose our selves, a Toy to save? From thence, where we nor smart, nor griefe did feele, We through the womb come crawling weakly hither; Then getting strength, we scratch and fight a while; And, through the grave, passe on, we know not whither. If we pursue what nat'rally delights us, And walk that course, which gives the flesh content; Our Conscience, or some Powre-divine affrights us, With inward seares, and threats of punishment; And, if our selves we virtuously dispose, The World, and all without us, are our Foes. Disgracefull slanders, ev'ry where attend us, Though none can, justly, any where accuse us: They, who are most obliged to befriend us, When we expect best usage, most abuse us. They, who to all enormities are prone, And make no conscience, of the foulest crimes, (If they suspect us guiltie but of One) Mis-judge us, as off-scourings of the Times. While for their peace, our studies we employ, And spend our selves, to propagate their good; They, labour our well-doing, to destroy, And staine their murth'rous weapons, with our blood, As if those portions they regarded not, Which were not torne, out of a brothers throat. Since Kings, and Princes, were at first promoted, Nor for their owne, but for the Peoples sake, Why, on their trappings, have all Ages doted? How, did our Creatures, flaves of us, first make? How grew man-kind so mad, to flatter them Vp to that needlesse height, of pomp, and powre, Which makes their Arrogancies to contemne Our Freedomes? and our Birth-rights to devoure? How, are they still so fool'd, as not to know (By that which they have heard, and read, and see) That, Tyrants alwayes have an overthrow, When great'st their Hopes, and their Oppressions be? And, justly, lose their Honours, Crownes, and Lives, By struggling for unjust Prerogatives? Since GOD, for MAN, at first, this world did frame, (And made it principally for the sake Of those who serve him, and adore his Name) Why, doth his Foe, possession thereof take? How comes it, that the Serpent, and his breed, Lords Paramount through all Earths Kingdomes are? And, that the promis'd and the blessed Seed, Enjoyes of this vast Globe, so small a share? Yea, since the Earth is GODS, and they are His, To whom, by free donation, it was given: Why, is their due infringed, as it is? And, why are they from their possessions driven, Scorn'd, injur'd, and abus'd, as abject things, Where they should honour'd be, as Lords and Kings? Why is the chosen flock of Christ so few, And, they so numerous, who them despite? (The Pagan, the Mahumetan, the Iew, The Papist, and the Bosome-Hypocrite.) Since GOD made Man, for good, and not for ill, (To be in him, and with him, ever blessed) How did his Foe first captivate his Will? How, of his Creature, is GOD dispossessed? How, is he glorified, while those Fiends Do persecute, insult, and domineere In mischieves? and in ruining his Friends, Who said, Their Lives and Deaths, to him are deare? Since GOD is good, why, so prevaileth evill? Since he's Almightie, how, so thrives the Devill? Whilst these Expostulations I pursu'd, A BOOKE to me appeared, fairly writ; In which, I satisfying answers view'd To all the Questionings of Carnall-wit. Wherewith, my Soule remained satisfide, And drew her selfe from these wild Contemplations, (Which, elfe perhaps, had carried her aside From better, and from safer meditations.) Then, from all outward Noyses, to be free, Into my Selfe, I further did retire; Ev'n to that Closet, which is call'd in me, The INNER-MAN, to seek out my Desire: And, being there, enough I heard and saw, To teach, to comfort, and to keep in awe. For, then, my Heart, (which did before appeare A little, narrow, lonely, darksome Roome) Was filled with a Light, that shin'd so cleare, And made the same so visible become; That (looking inwardly) I saw distensions So boundlesse, in their Width, their Depth, and Height, That, weighing well a fleshly Hearts dimensions, It might be thought an admirable sight. For, were you on that mountaine, or high cliffe, Whence you might farthest round about you see, (Suppose it were the famous Tenariffe) The Prospects, there, to those that In-ward bee, To me, no more to be compar'd, appeares Than that within a Nut-shell, to the Spheares. It shewes a Place (if Place we call it may) Within the Concave of whose wondrous Orb, The Eye of Contemplation may survay Sights, which no Bounds, or Shaddowes, do disturb. There, may be seene the meanes which doth disclose, Though not the Essence of Eternall-things, So much at least, as ev'ry notion showes, From whence, beleefe of their true Being springs. There, may the Soule that hideous Downefall see, Which leadeth to the brinck of Desperation: There, may that Entrance plainly viewed be, Which guideth to a blessed Exaltation: And, there, the Spirit, to our knowledge, brings The Good and Ill, of all created things. For, hitherto, I never heard of ought In Heav'n, or Earth, but I perceiv'd it there: Yea, many Novelties from thence are brought, Which have no Being, any other where. It is indeed, another World within The World without me; and I thither go, When I to loath externall things begin, And, doubtfull am, what in this World, to do. I sometime there have entertainments had, Like those which may in Paradise be found: Sometime againe, 'tis like a Chaos made, Wherein deluding Fancies do abound. Sometime, the Light of Heav'n there seems to dwell, And, otherwhile, it is as dark as Hell. Within our selves (as God vouchsafes his grace) That Blisse, and that true happinesse is found, Which men seek after in that Time and Place, Which have not much relatiom to this ROVND: I being thither guided (by that Light Which faileth none) there, found out an abode Quite out of hearing, and beyond the sight Of those distractions, which I saw abroad. There, found I out, a Resting place to hide me From scorne of Fooles, and from the Strife of tongues: From their despight, who slander and deride me; From private mischiefes, and from publike wrongs; From all the menaces, my eares have heard; From all the perils, which my heart hath fear'd. There, I with sportive sleightings, did peruse That, which their malice, who these times do flatter, Have spewed forth against my blamelesse Muse, In lumps of scurrill, base, and witlesse matter: And, am content to let the CVRS alone, Though loud they snarle and bawle; because I find Those Beasts are by their Masters tezed on; And, do but bark, according to their kind. Though not their wit, their malice might, perhaps, Deserve a Rating; and, I could have flung them A Bone, that would have broke, or gagg'd their chaps; (Or, throwne the Wild-fires of my Brain among them) But, they in vaine shall bark; in vaine they raile; To scratch the Scabs, I scorne to foule my naile. For, I, in that Retirement, seem'd no more By such decrepit-Malice, to be hurt, Than is a well compacted Rockie-shore, On which, the Billows cast up Foame, and durt. There, shewne I was, the high prerogatives, (The priviledges) of my Second-birth; And, from what noble Root, my Soule derives Her Pedigree, though she be cloath'd with earth. And, could I still (when I from Contemplation Returne to Act) retaine in me that height Of Spirit; and the reall estimation Of that, wherein at those times, I delight: I never more, an earthly hope should cherish, Or, prize the honours, of the Beasts that perish. There, on a Throne, above the world I sate, Beholding, with disdaine, Terrestriall things; The fruitlesse love of Mortals, and their hate, The Tyrannies of Subjects, and of Kings. There, I beheld (without those perturbations, Which vexed me abroad) how Pride and Folly Support each other, by their combinations, In wicked projects, and in works unholy. There, spi'd I, by what secret Links and Ties, The cursed-Counsell which deludes the King, And, that false-pack which in our bosome lies, Their dark Designes together closely bring: And why so many moneths in vain are spent, Their treacheries and treasons, to prevent. There, can I sit obscur'd, and spie what ends Are closely follow'd by the Politician; Who, seemingly, the common-Cause befriends, That he may ruine it, without suspition. There, I descrie, what avarice, what frauds, What spight, and what hypocrisie doth lurk In many, whom the publike-Voice applauds, As faithfull men, in carrying on the Work. Without distemper, there, I think upon Their pride and envie, who had rather see Three Kingdomes universally undone, Then, wained from their wilfulnesse to be: Because, I know, GODS Worke will be effected, In spight of what their madnesse hath projected. There, without breach of Patience, I can heed, How impudently some have sought to seem Of eminent desert; who are indeed More worthy of contempt, then of esteem: How quaintly other-some can mischief do; And then, by policie, and frauds contrive To purchase thanks, and pay, and favour too, For that, which, rather, should a halter have. Yea, there, without offence, I notice take How zealously Malignants are befriended; How sleight account of their deserts we make, Who have, with life, and goods, the State defended: And, with what confidence, we still confide On those, that will be true to neither side. There, likewise, without wrath, I view, and heare How senslesse many, who are counted wise, Both of advantages, and dangers are, Which ev'ry day appear before our eyes. How needlesse good Advice, by some, is thought Till 'tis too late; how, to prevent a Wound They lose a life; and, (to be thriftie thought) How, they to save a groat, mispend a pound. How desp'rately they somtime take a Fall, To scape a Slip; how, other while, to save Some Rotten-Members, they adventure all Which we by Grace, or Natures Charters have. All this, in my Retirements, I can see, Yet, nothing vexeth, or affrigheth me. For, therewithall, such meanes appear to show That both the good Endeavours of our Friends, And all the Counterminings of the Foe, Shall work out that, at last, which GOD intends: And, that, if we contented can become To beare our Burthens, but a little longer, His Grace, will render them, lesse troublesome, Or make us, to sustaine them, daily stronger. Wherewith well pleas'd, I totally resign'd My Will to his; And, by that Resignation, Delightfull Calmes within my heart did finde, So freeing me, from former perturbation, That, all within, and all without me, kept Such silence, as if all the world had slept. As at high Midnight in a Desert Vale, Or'e-hung and bordred by a Double-Hill, On which there blowes not any whistling-gale, Down which, there flowes not any murm'ring Rill, Near which, nor Bird doth sing, nor Beast doth play, Through which, no Travailer doth ever passe; By which, there growes no rusling leafe or spray, In which, no noise of Creature ever was; Such seem'd that Calme, which, then, I did possesse, (Or deeper, if it might a deeper be) And, that the Silence, which I now expresse, May not prove empty both to You, and Me, In this Retreat, from ev'ry other noise, As from a farre, to me there came a VOICE. A VOICE there came; From whence, I will not say: Judge yee, to whom I shall report the same; For, if you mark the sense, conceive you may Aswell as I, from whom and whence it came. So still a VOICE it was, that with mine Eare, I heard it not; nor made it such a noise As that, which our corporeall sence doth hear; Nor was it an articulated VOICE: But, such a VOICE as when the Spirit brings A Message down from GOD; and, to the heart Doth whisper those intelligible things, Which words do but imperfectly impart; Or, such a VOICE, as from GODS written Word, The Genuine sense well heeded, may afford. And yet it spake so plainly, and did shew Those Informations which I gain'd thereby, In ev'ry Circumstance, to be so true, That of no branch thereof, misdoubt have I. Thus, it began. Thou Off-spring of the earth, Whom Providence designed, in this Nation To have thy temp'rall Being; and thy Birth In this Degree, and in this Generation: Suppose not, that, in any worth of thine There could a merit, or a motive be, Which might Eternall-Providence incline, To cast so gracious an aspect on thee, As to descend so low, as to thy heart, The knowledge of his pleasure, to impart. For, from thy Childhood, he thy thoughts hath seen, Heard all thy words, observed all thy waies; Can tell how vaine thy youthfull years have been, And, how thou hast defil'd thy elder-daies. He knowes thy seeming vertues imperfections; He saw what evill secretly thou didst; And made thee likewise feel by due corrections, That, he beheld what from the world thou hidst. The Folly, Fraud, and falshood of thy heart; The vices, and the vainnesse of thy tongue; How false to others and thy selfe thou art, How slow to good, how swift in doing wrong, He truly knowes; and, findes thee apt to do No dutie, but what he compells thee to. And, he observed (though thy guilt he smothers) That, thou to whom he better things hath taught, Art in those Crimes as deeply di'd as others, Who on this Isle, these present Plagues have brought. Observ'd he hath, how fondly thou hast striven With Wordlings, in their lusts, to have a share; Although, to thee, experiments were given, What empty, and pernitious things they are. Yea, with some indignation he discerned That, madly, thou didst many times partake In provocations, whereof thou hadst warned This Land (even those thou vowedst to forsake) And, that, with greedinesse thou hast pursu'd, Those vanities that ought to be eschew'd. Although thy heart inform'd thee, long agoe (By an indubitable information) That, all the services thou couldst bestow Vpon the Minions of this Generation, Should nothing profit thee: Thou, nerethelesse, (Forgetting what was counsell'd, and resolved) Didst fawne on some of them, in thy distresse; And hadst, no doubt, thereby thy selfe involved Within those Nets, which at their Boords are spred; But, that, GOD did permit them to contemn Thy honest Muses: who a plot had laid, Into those vertues, to have flatter'd them, Which they regard not: otherwise that Course Which nothing better'd them, had made thee worse. When thou hadst, in thy Poems, vice reproved, He search'd thy heart; and saw it was not, then, Meere love to vertue, whereby thou wert moved; Or, that thou hadst lesse guilt then other men. Somtime, that fickle bubble, Reputation, Sometime that hope which thy vaine Fancie gives thee; Sometime, applauses, sometimes, indignation, Into a just reproofe of sinners drives thee. Some other by-respects, oft wrought upon Thy heart, to rouze up in thee an indeavour In things, that seemed worthy to be done: But, thy performances proceeded never From that true love, and that sincere affection Which thou didst owe to Him, and his perfection. And, for these things, their mouths wide op'ned be, Who seek to turn thy glory to thy shame: Those witlesse Railers are let loose on thee, Whom, in thy Measures, thou didst scorn to name. For this, thou sufferest by the sharp despights Of open-sinners: and much more, by farre, Through those malicious, and proud Hypocrites, Who kindled first, and still foment this warre. For this, thou (who for others couldst espie Conceal'd events) hast oft so blinded been In matters of thine own, that what thine eye Seem'd fixed on, thy wit hath over-seen; Till, to thy mind, they through those meanes were brought, By which each Foole, and ev'ry child is taught. For this, wert thou deservedly depriv'd Of blessings, which thou els mightst have enjoy'd: And, for that cause, hast worthily surviv'd, To see thy hopes, with other mens, destroy'd, For this, thou (with the first) hast plundred bin; For this, thou both by Friends and Foes art torn; For this, where thou hadst hopes, respects to win, Instead of honour, thou reproach hast born: For this, thy best endeavours have been crost, By them, whose power could els no spite have done thee; For this, those paines, and those designes are lost, Which otherwise had great advantage won thee; And, but that whom GOD loves, he leaveth never, For this, rejected thou hadst been for ever. Yet such is his compassion, that his love Still seeks to reingage thee by his graces; Beholding thee with favour from above, In wants, in suffrings, in all times and places, According to thy trust in him reposed, (When thy Remembrances did first appeare) As with a wall of brasse he thee inclosed, From those who at thy Muse inraged were. The Prelates and the Nobles, who conspired To ruine thee, and thereto did comply, Obtain'd no power to act what they desired, Though open to their fury thou didst lie; Although some suffred, then, (for milder lines) By Stygmatizings, Banishment, and Fines. When thou wert grasped in that Dragons pawes, Who sought thy spoil; GOD, strangely charm'd his rage: He from devouring thee restrain'd his Jawes, Even while he rav'd, and storm'd at thy presage. Yea, whereas thou didst imprecate on those, Who should malitiously thy lines defame, (And without penitence their Truth oppose) A Publike Marke, to brand them for the same; Ev'n so it came to passe: For, scarcely one Of those Oppressers are at this day free From having those just Censures undergone By which, the publike-Foes, now marked be; And, to the chief of them, this mark GOD gave, That, He with shame, went headlesse to his grave. In all the changes of this toylsome life, He kept thee with an honest Reputation. He, was thy comfort still, in times of griefe, In dangers, he hath been thy preservation. He sav'd thee from the furioust Pestilence That ever in this Clymate did appear; And, hitherto, hath by his Providence, Secur'd thee from the Sword, yet raging here. Now, when they lack, who surfeted of late; When Bread, with men more worthie, groweth scant, (Yea, though the Foe hath spoiled thy estate) He keepes thy family, from pinching want; And makes thee hopefull, whatsoere betide, That, he for thee and thine will still provide. Moreover, when thy patience was nigh tir'd; When thy estate, the world did most despise; GOD gave thee that which most thy heart desir'd, (And, of all things terrestriall, most hath priz'd) He, likewise, hath preserv'd thee to behold Those things, in thine own life-time verifide, Which seem'd as dreames, when first by thee fore-told; Which fooles did sleight, and wiser men deride. And, not thus only, was he pleas'd to do; But, now, hath also call'd thee, to prepare The Way of Peace, and, to reveale unto These British Isles, what those Conditions are, Whereon, it is his pleasure to return That Blessing to them, for which, yet they mourne. It is not for thy sake, that, now, his eyes He fixeth, not on persons eminent; Or, hath not chosen one more learn'd and wise, By whom, this weighty Message might be sent: But, rather, to abase and vex their pride Who carnall Pompe, and outward showes adore, (Vouchsafing scarce to turn their eye aside, To heed the suits, or counsells of the poore) And, that (to humble them) they may be faine Perforce, to hear, and to accept from him, (Whose guifts and perfon, most of them disdaine) The Way of Peace, which he shall offer them; Or else, through pride, grow hardned in that sin, Which bringeth Desolation faster in. This is the Course, which Providence hath took When selfe-conceit, and sin, befooleth Nations; And Carnall policie, doth over-look The lowly meanes, of timely preservations. Thus, that the Jewish-pride he down might bring, When they the pompe of heathenish-Kings affected, He made, one Seeking-Asses, their first King; And, them unto a Shepheard, next, subjected. When their proud Pharisees, and Priests, beleeved, That He, who came the Kingdom to restore, Should from their power and wisdom have received Chiefe aid thereto; he rais'd it by the poor. From their formalities, his eyes he turn'd, And chose the meek-ones, whom their pride had scorn'd. And, GOD thus dealeth still, when he intends To purge a People, and refine a State; Making one motion, move to sev'rall ends, As it to sundrie Objects may relate. Who should have thought, that saw a while ago The Prelacie in pompe (advancing thorow This potent Isle) it should be baffled so In height of all it pride, at Edenborough? Who could have then supposed, that a Stoole, Flung by a sillie woman, in her zeal, (When policie did labour to befoole Your brethren, and the Dragons wound to heale) Should have, in thousands, kindled such a flame Of zeale, as from that meane occasion came? Who would have thought the late despised Scot, (A Nation, whom your elders dis-esteem'd, A Nation, whom your Fathers loved not, And, of whose friendship, carelesse you have seem'd) Should first have rouz'd, a passage to have broke Through that Attempt; which, will (if unrepented And wilfull sins obstruct not) breake that yoke Which Heresie and Tyranny invented? Who would have been perswaded, but erewhile, The Scot should faithfully for you have kept Your nigh-lost footing in the Irish Ile? And, while the Flame into their borders crept, Should, brother-like, contribute their chiefe powers, To quench the Burnings, which your Towns devours? Or, who would have beleeved (having heard The scandals, and malignant jealousies, Wherewith some do their love, yet, mis-reward) That Scotland should for Englands aid arise, And in their marches through your fruitfull lands, More conscience make, than you your selves have shown, Of laying violent, and griping hands, On them, whose wounds and losses are your own? But, GOD is pleas'd these things should come to passe, To humble and abase that high conceit, Which falsly of your selves admitted was; And, that both you and they might have a sight Of his great Providence, in so proceeding; And, Good, and Bad, confesse it merits heeding. For, by this course, he doth effect his will Within them, by them, and upon them too. Both Friends and Foes, all actions good or ill, Promote the work which he intends to do. They, who, long time, have wilfully persisted In crooked paths, from which they call'd have bin, And, in those Calls, the Spirits Voyce resisted, (Or carelesly proceeded in their sin) Shall (blind with malice, and obdur'd with pride) Sleight all the counsels, tendred now by thee: The Tenour of this VOICE, they shall deride, And, madly, stubborne in their Courses be, Till on their heads, those judgements down shall come, Which are an unrepentant Sinners doome. And, when with plagues deserved they are stung, (In stead of Penitence, or filiall awe) As doth a Dog at whom a stone is flung, So they shall snarle, and so the weapon gnaw. Or, rather, as it was fore-told of those, For whom, GOD, his fifth Violl should prepare, The greater, still, their feare or torment growes, The lesse to be reform'd will those men care. They (to the Throne and Kingdome of the BEAST True Vassals being) will GODS name blaspheme; Or, else be stupified, at the least, When GOD with stripes, or counsells visits them. To these, this VOICE, will no good Omen sing; To these, no Peace, no Comfort, will it bring. But, they who by their chastisements for sin, Are humbled so, so school'd, and made so meeke, As to admit that true repentance in, Which makes them gladly, Truth, and Mercie seeke, Ev'n they shall from this VOICE, receive content; And not disdaine the Wine of consolation, Though in an earthen Vessell it be sent; But, take it with a thankfull acceptation. And, if of these, that number found shall be, For which, three wicked Kingdomes may be spar'd, You shall from Ruine, once againe be free; To shew the World, that, what few now regard, Prevents more mischiefe, and more safetie brings, Than potent Armies, Parlaments, and Kings. For, Kings, and Parlaments, and Armies, too, When crying sins in any Realme abound, Advantage not, so much as they undo; As, by a late experience, you have found. A King you had, who was, at first, conceiv'd, To pitie, and to pietie enclin'd; (Such, he was really of thee beleev'd) Yet, of those Vertues, now, small signes you find. The Cup and Fornications of the WHORE, Do seeme to have bewitcht his royall brest: With bloudy sins, his Realmes are flowed o're, (Defil'd with crimes, that cannot be exprest) And, more in danger to be quite undone, Than, ever since, a King first fill'd this Throne. He takes a Course, which if pursu'd, will do him More dammages than all his forraigne foes: And all their malice could have brought unto him. Yea, so improvident a path he goes, As if by his Fore-fathers, or by Him, Some sin had been committed, which hath shaken His verie Throne, defac'd his Diadem, And, for which, Vengeance must ere long be taken. For, though he knowes the peoples griefes and feares, Though sprawling in their bloud he sees them lying; Though he beholds the flames about their eares, And, in their deaths, his honour daily dying: Yet, seemes he nothing to heare, know, or see, Which for your safety, or his own may be. The Royall-Pow'r, that should the Realme have guarded, Is to the ruine thereof, mis-imploy'd; The Perquisites, allow'd to have rewarded Deserving-men, by Ruffians are enjoy'd. The Dignities, ordain'd to have been placed On them, whose deeds their noblenesse declar'd; To Slaves are prostituted; and disgraced, By being on Buffoones and Clownes conferr'd. His Councell-Table was become a snare, His Court, a Sanctuarie for Transgressors; The Iudgement-Seats, were engines to prepare Advantages, for Bribers and Oppressors: The Soveraigne, from the Subject is estranged; And Kingship into Tyranny, is changed. But, though the King be partner in these crimes, 'Tis you, who have your selves, and him undone: For, as Idolaters in former times, First, made carv'd Images, of Wood and Stone, (Perhaps, but meerly for Commemoration Of some deceased Worthy) and, at last, Improv'd it into sottish adoration; So, Those, on whom the Government was plac'd, (By prudent Counsell) Base men, by degrees So idolized, and with flatteries So long, in servile manner, bow'd their knees To their Self-will; that, first, to tyrannize The peoples blockishnesse, and basenesse brought them: Yea, how to be Oppressors, they first taught them. And, when Kings saw, the peoples foolishnesse Did make themselves beleeve, that their owne Creature Had therein, an inherent awfulnesse, Advancing it above the humane nature; They, quickly from that folly, and that feare, Advantages assumed to improve Their pow'rs: It made them greater to appeare; And in a more Majestick Orb to move. The slavish gestures, and the servile phrase Long us'd in Court, did thereto so much add, That, he who like a man, declares his cause, Is judg'd unmannerly, or somwhat mad: Nay, to that height the, Royall claime is brought, That none, but Slaves, are now true Subjects thought. A Parliament you have, which you obtained, When you were most desirous to have had it; You, thereunto a priviledge have gained, Which, now, more fixt than formerly, hath made it. The House of Peeres is of a party cleared, Whom, leaning to your, Common-Foe you doubted; Whose power you felt, whose policie you feared, And, whom, long since, some gladly would have outed. Yet had Corruption over-fill'd it so With honour'd Titles, worne without deserts; And, with so many, raised from below, To sit on Princely Seats, with Slavish-hearts, That, when your troubles well-nigh cur'd you thought, Far greater mischieves, were upon you brought. Your House of Commons, (though when first convented, It fill'd you with a hopefull expectation) Hath ev'ry way so truly represented, The Common Constitution of this Nation; That, little hitherto hath been effected To mitigate your Feares, or settle Peace, According to the issue you expected; But, ev'ry day your sorrowes more increase. So great an inundation of confusion Is broken in upon you; that, in vaine You hope or labour for a good conclusion, Till GOD himselfe make up the Breach againe; And, you (with more sincerity) confesse Your Guilt, your Weaknesse, and your Foolishnesse. Betwixt You, and your King, there is of late A cursed Fire broke forth, whose raging flame Each others ruine threatens, like to that Which from Abimelech, and Shechem, came. So damnable a Spirit of Contention Is conjur'd up, that, his designes are brought Past all those remedies, and that prevention Which by the wit of mortalls can be wrought. So madly, you each other do oppose, That ev'ry one consults and acts in vaine: What one reares up, another overthrowes; What one destroyes, another builds again: And nothing is the vulgar expectation But ruine, if not utter Desolation. For, crying-sins do gen'rally prevaile, The Rules of Order, quite aside are laid: The prudence of the Counsellour doth faile; The honestest-Designes, are most gain-said; The Grossest Falshood, soonest is believ'd; His cause best speedes, who aimes at basest-ends, The worst-Transgressour, shall be soon'st repriev'd; The veriest Knave shall find the Lordliest friends: And, when Foundations thus are overthrowne, What can the Righteous do? what likely hope Have Husbandmen, when all is over-growne With Briars and Thornes, to reap a thriftie crop? Or, what can by a Parliament be done, Where all are with Corruption over-grown? With Warlike Forces, too, now strongly arm'd You do appear; and Martiall men abound, As though each Township, Bee-hive-like had swarm'd, And Horse, and Armes, sprung daily from the ground. But, what have these availed, in regard Of expectation? Nay, how multiplide Are these afflictions, rather, (which you fear'd) By their dissensions, insolence, or pride? Your Treasures, Stocks, &amp; Fields, they have nigh wasted, Their avaritions fury to allay; Yet, as if they had Pharoah's kine out-fasted, So greedie, and so hungrie, still are they, That, all the plenties of your peacefull years, Will hardly quench that vast desire of theirs. Want of sincerenesse in your chiefe Commanders, Too much ambition, much respect of friends: (Most men that hear this, know these are no slanders) Fraud, Envie, Cowardice, or private-ends; And, gen'rally defect of Discipline: Or, (to be plaine) want of that honestie, Which these Forth-breakings of the Wrath-divine Hath, now, required in your Soulderie, Have set licentiousnesse so much at large, And made most Officers, presume upon Such loosnesse; and so slackly to discharge Their duties; that, you likely are to run, By your owne Forces (as the matter goes) Not much lesse hazard, than by open Foes. Your Common men, (this will disparage none Among you Martialists, that blamelesse are) Have not in misdemeanours, been out-gone By many, who the States opposers were. They cheat, rob, lye, curse, sweare, blaspheme and rore, They equally oppresse both Friend, and Foe; They plunder, scoffe, insult, game, drink and whore, And ev'rie day corrupt each other so; That, if this plague continue but a while, You and your King, so many Rogues will arme, That, throughout ev'rie Township of this Ile, This cursed brood of Lice will crawle and swarme, Till they have quite devoured those that fed them; And, pine in that starv'd Body, which first bred them. For, though the highest honours temporarie, On Souldiers are conferred, whose true worth, Whose vertues in employments militarie, With an illustrious candor shineth forth: Though they, who to defend their Countries cause, Themselves to death and dangers do expose, (Observing duly, GODS and Natures Lawes, Not only to their friends, but to their foes) Though these, deserve all honours; no expression Is full enough to make an illustration Of their ignoble, and their base condition, Who triumph in their Countries desolation: And, as the raskall sort of Tinkers do, Pretend to mend one hole, and then make two. For, these foure yeares of Discord, have so changed, The gentlenesse, already, of this Nation; And, men and women are so far estranged, From civill, to a barb'rous inclination: They are so prone to mutinous disorders, So forward in all mischievous projections, So little mov'd with robberies or murthers, And, so insensible of good Affections; That, they whom you have arm'd for your defence, Will shortly ruine you, unlesse preventions Be interposed by that Providence, Which frustates diabolicall intentions: And therefore, now, Conditions are propounded, On which, a Restauration may be grounded. Yea, now, when Med'cines (that most soveraigne were At other times) have multiply'd diseases: When all your Policies quite routed are; To intervene, a Timely-Mercie pleases. Now, that your Armies, King, and Parliaments, Which were your hopefulst meanes of preservation, Are made, by Sin, imperfect Instruments, And, leave these Iles almost in desperation: Thou, shalt once more, to dis-respective men, A Herald-extraordinarie be; And, carrie them conditions, once agen, Whereby they from these troubles may be free; And, that those Angels which now smite these Lands, From Desolation, may with-hold their hands. Now, then, for Overtures of Peace provide; Silence thy Trumpets, let thy Drums be still; Furle up thy Colours, lay Commands aside, Sheath up thy Sword, resume againe thy Quill; And, make thou such an entrie on Record, Of what thou intellectually dost heare, That, to these present Times, it may afford A legible Expresse, of what they are: That, thereby, meek men may have information, What humble service, and what sacrifice May best promove that reconciliation, Which will conclude these bloudy Tragedies; And, that it may, by working upon some, A Blessing, unto all these Isles, become. To that intent, once more, thy selfe prepare, To heare inraged Tyrants madly rave; The envious to detract, the proud to jeer, And Fooles to shew how little wit they have. Prepare thy selfe, to suffer what disgrace The spight of secret malice hath begun; And, all those injuries, which, to thy face, May, by an open enemy, be done. And faulter not: but, plainly publish thou, What is, and shall be spoken to thy heart; That, if these will not, times to come may know, By what good Spirit thou inspired art: And, that men may, unto GOD's praise, confesse, That, He, in Justice, is not mercilesse. And be not sway'd by any by-respect To King, or People, Persons, or Estates. From uttering (to thy power) the full effect Of whatsoever, now, this VOICE relates. Nor be thou so presumptuous, as to add One syllable (beyond what shall be true) Through feare; or, that some profit may be had; Lest thy vaine feares, and thy false hopes thou rue. But, speak what truth shall whisper forth to thee, In so impartiall, and so bold a straine, That, to their soules, it may a terrour be, Who still, in their impenitence remaine: And, therewithall, those consolations bring, Which make the meeke, and broken-hearted sing. Feare neither Peeres, nor Commons, Friends, nor Foes, So long as thou thy duty shalt performe; Nor feare the threatnings or the frownes of those, Who, at thy publishing this VOICE may storme, For, of whatever they shall thee deprive, Who, therewithall, are spitefully offended, Thou for the same shalt seventie fold receive, In life and death, by all good men befriended. And, if by thy Detractors ought be spoke, Which this thy warrantable dutie wrongs, Their malice shall quite vanish into smoke, And for the same, ten hundred thousand tongues Shall censure them, who now mis-censure thee, Ev'n while they are, and when they shall not bee. The VOICE, here made a pause: For, though I had My selfe, into my selfe retir'd, as far, As a Retreat could possibly be made, From things, that Bars to Contemplation are; Yet, thither carried I so much about me, Relating to the Flesh, which I have on me; (And also to the World that is without me) That she, with violence, broke in upon me; And came so over-joy'd with fruitlesse newes Of an approaching Treatie, and with hope Of Peace thereby; that she disturb'd my Muse, And brought those Revelations to a stop, Of which, this Ile shall never heare againe, Till she hath prov'd all other meanes in vaine. Your wits, yee Politicians therefore trie, Yee Mightie, thereunto your Forces joyne, And you, that with a Formall-pietie, Or morall-facings, your projections line. Pursue your waies of Peace, till you are gone So far, that you no forwarder can get; And find, that when your wilfull course is done, You, like wild-Bulls, lie tumbling in a net: For, then, perhaps (though but a Mouse it were, That gnaw'd the snare) your pride would be content, The meanes of your deliverance to heare, By whomesoere the Message shall be sent. When that hour coms, the VOICE that spake before, Will speak again; and, then Ile tell you more. Meane-while, I purpose to returne unto Those other under-takings, wherewithall I am intrusted; or, those works to do, For which, the Common-danger, first may call. And since I ought not wholly to neglect, Their private wants, who on my care depend, I will be bold, a little, to respect My own Affaires, which few men, yet, befriend; Lest, e're I finish what I have begun, I may incurre some sudden detriment; Or, else, by my Oppressors, be undone. For, he that makes no conscience to prevent His private ruine, shall be seldom heard In any publike matter, with regard. LORD, by thy power (for, by thy power, alone, Such Plagues are cur'd) recure us e're too late, And, once again, in mercie, looke upon This heart-sick, languishing, and dying State. Once more be reconcil'd: (Once more at least) To these distracted, these divided Lands, Let that Preserving-Mercie be exprest, On which, the safety of a Kingdome stands. Abate those Earth-quakes, which have made unsteady The Pillars of this Church and Common-wealth; Disperse those Vapours, which have made us giddie; Purge out those Humours, which impaire our health: Support the Limbes, which must prevent our fall, Cut off, those Members, which may ruine all. And, give me Courage, Wisdome, Grace, and Pow'r, So, to discerne thy Will; so, to expresse What is inspir'd; and in so good an houre, As, that it may prepare the Way of Peace. THOV, that, by Babes, and Sucklings, dost restore Decayed Strength; and, by dispised things, Advance thy Kingdom, and thy Glory, more Then by the Councells, and the Pow'rs of Kings: So, make this VOICE to speak; so, make men heare; That, both Times present, and the Times to come, May love thy Mercies, and thy Judgements, feare, Throughout these Islands, till the day of doome: And, let this VOICE'S good effects be showne Most clear in Him, by whom, thou mak'st it known. The second Canto. The VOICE and Muzings, hitherto exprest, In me, so sad, so serious Thoughts had left, And, stamped them so deep into my brest, That, of it health, my Body they bereft: And, e're my former strength could be renew'd (Or those Affaires dispens'd with, which deny To be, at will, delayed or pursu'd) Three moneths of Relaxation passed by: And, in that space, was op'ned such a Sluce To Interruptions, discomposing so My meditations; that, them to reduce To their late temper, I had much adoe. Oh GOD! from me, how fast good motions fly! How long are they unborn! how soon they dy! My heart, that is corrupt enough to know What any wicked man can think or say, Before my feet, began harsh rubs to throw, And, cast great stumbling blocks orethwart my way. When I had some remov'd, Loe, (with a jeere) A thought within me said; If nothing else But Vertue guides thy Pen, what needed here, All that, which of thy Selfe, this Poem tells? Why mention'st thou (as if thou wert afraid Thy Readers knew not, or forgot the same) What thou fore-toldst? what thou hast thought or said? And what events on thy Predictions came? And, in a Magisteriall-straine hast spoke, As if thou for a Prophet wouldst be took? Indeed, my Vanities, I find to be More then enough, my Musings to expose To mis-constructions; and, to bring on me The sharp result of such like thoughts as those: For, never could I fix my mind upon GOD'S Work so closely, but, Charrs great or small, Have still been therewith brought me to be done, By those old Haglers, whom I live withall. Ev'n in this Taske, (though GOD stands over me With Fire, and Sword) such failings will appear, And, so imperfect my endeavours bee, That, much I grieve, to think how vain they are; And feard, they had been but effects of pride, Till thus, for me, another Thought replide. GOD, pleased seemes, to make thy Vices do Those duties, which thy Virtues leave undone. And what though this may add (if it prove so) Dishonour to thy self, so GOD have none? If thou thy Thoughts, hast cloathed in such words, And, them in such a dressing, forth shall send, As best advantage to thy Selfe affords, Why should it any other man offend? Or, if thou addest ought for thine own praise, Why should an envious Reader grudge the same, Since Malice, and Dispight, have many waies, To turn such empty Glories, to thy shame? Or, why shouldst thou forbeare, if cause thou find, To make thy words help fortifie thy mind? Thine own expressions, are sometime the Charmes Which waken thy Resolves that were asleep: Thy Heart, the repetition of them warmes; Thy Spirit from dejection they do keep. The mentioning what GOD hath for thee done, Or, what he hath inabled thee to do, May to his glorie be insisted on; And, otherwhile, to thy advantage too. Why then, through Feare of witlesse Censurers, (Or, of an ayrie scoffe, shouldst thou omit Thy selfe to mention, or thine own affaires, When thou (on good occasion) thinkst it fit? Since, if thy Muses would be so confin'd, They to themselues were traytors, or unkind. And, to make voyd what shall well purpos'd be, There intervene so many casualties, By mis-conceiving, or mis-knowing thee, Sometime, such Inconveniences arise, As that, it may essentially advance Thy Work in hand, if some few lines be spent, To add, or to inlarge a circumstance, Which captious men may think impertinent; For, when the Matter moves not that respect, Which is desir'd, perhaps, the Manner may: And, if thou honestly thy hopes effect, What though Fools think, that thou the Fool didst play? Although harsh doomes, this age to thee affords, The Times to come, will give thee better words. Thus spake my Thoughts; But, little do I care How I am judg'd, save only for their sake, On whom those Verities, which I declare, May thereby, more or lesse impression make. The care I tooke, was how to hear again The VOICE, which I conceiv'd had much to say, That to this Islands peace doth appertaine; If, what is councelled, men would obey. For, well I saw, although unseen it was By many, (and too well perceiv'd by some) That such a Time, was well nigh come to passe, As my preceding Canto, said should come, Before, the VOICE I heard, the rest would say, Of that, which was begun the other day. Yea, I discovered them, on either side, To be distracted and confounded, so, By that which falshood, policie, and pride, Selfe-will, and Avarice, hath brought them to; That, I began to feele my selfe affraid, Destruction might or'e-whelme this Generation, Before there would be meanes to hear, that said, Which may, perhaps, prevent our desolation. Assoon therefore, as GOD to me restor'd Decayed strength, and my infirmities, Did Opportunities, and time afford, I recompos'd my scatt'red faculties; And, being then retir'd, and noise alaid, The VOICE that spake before, thus, further said. Come Weakling, fit thy soule, prepare thine eare, Gird up thy loines, and set thy selfe apart, That thou, the more intentively, mayst heare What, shall be further spoken to thy heart. That TREATY, now, is at a fruitlesse end Which interrupted what I had to say: That Hope, whereon so many did depend, Is, like a faire bright Morning, past away And, leaves you in a Cloud, that seemes to threat A terrible tempestuous After-noone; Which, you with many Feares, will round beset, Before the Day of Triall, shall be done: And, therefore, that which will be now declar'd, May, peradventure, find the more regard. You look for Peace, (and he who well can sing That Song, deserveth highly to be priz'd) But, who can thither such a blessing bring, Where all Conditions of it are despis'd? Or, what, as yet, have they to do with peace, Whom these Corrections, move not to repent? Whose Wickednesse, doth rather more increase, Then seem abated, by their chastisement? Who can expect, the fretting Corosives Should be removed from your Fest'ring sore Vntill the skillfull Surgeon first perceives, It may, with healing salves be plaistred o're, Vnlesse, he rather hath a minde to see The patient ruined, then cur'd to be? How few hast thou observ'd, whose former course Is better'd by those Plagues, which now are on them? How many, rather, do appear the worse? And, to be more corrupt then thou hast known them? In what perpetuall broiles are they involved, Who, for the publike welfare, most endeavour? How friendlesse are they, who are best resolved? And, in good resolutions, dare persever? How many, into Parties quicklie band A questioned Malignant to protect? How few men, for that Innocent, will stand, Whom Malice doth accuse, or but suspect? And who now lives, and loves the Common-Right, Who suffers not some insolent despight? Though most men see distractions hanging over Their giddie heads; their Tragedie begun; And, round about them, nothing can discover, But universall Ruine drawing on; Ambition, Malice, Avarice, and Pride, Selfe-will, Selfe-love, Hypocrisie, and Guile, As arrogantly still on horse-back ride, As if no Plague had seized on this Isle. This man for Place; that, striveth for Command; Pretends the Publike-weale, but, seekes his Own; And cares not, so he profit by the hand, Though Law and Gospell too, be overthrown: And, He that in defence of them doth come, Findes furious Foes abroad, and worse at home. In ev'rie Shire, in ev'rie Town and Citie, The Kingdoms discords are epitomiz'd: In everie Corporation, and Committee, Some Engine for Division is deviz'd. Occasions daily spring, each man ingaging, To side with, or stand leaning, to some Faction, And, by new quarrells, more and more enraging Their Furie, to the heightning of Distraction. An Emblem of which madnesse, he might draw, Who saw, within an old thatch'd Barne on fire, Poore beggars quarrelling for lousie straw, (Or dunghill rags, new raked from the mire) Who will nor heed their harmes, nor leave to brawl, Vntill the Flames consume Rogues, Rags, and All. How can calme Peace be timelie wooed thither. Where men so brutish are in their dissentions, And, where the meanes of knitting them together, Are still occasions made of new contentions? How can these Iles have Peace that are so vitious? And, who have Factious Spirits rais'd in them, As wilfully dispos'd, as those Seditious, Who brought destruction on Hierusalem? How can they looke for Peace, while they contrive Designes, enlarging, still, their discontent? While Policie, doth wedges daily drive, Twixt ev'ry joynt, to make a curelesse rent? And, while to mend the breaches of this Land Ther's nothing brought, but pebble-stones and sand? Who can unite again a Broken-bone, Whose parted ends, are set the fromward way? How long will oyle and water mix in One? Or, things quite Opposite together stay? There are betwixt you such Antipathies, And such abhominatings of each other, That, in no ordinarie Power it lies, To knit you in a perfect League together: And 'tis not possible, your fest'ring sores, Should ever heal, while in them there is found That putrified flesh, and rotten cores, Which keep from closing, and from growing sound? And which will suddenly break forth again, Augmenting more your hazzard, and your pain? How can these miserable Isles have Peace, While Justice, nor Compassion find regard? While they who should protect, do most oppresse? Where sin scapes blame, and Virtue wants reward? How can he hope for Peace, that would enjoy His wish on any termes? And, for the Shade, The Substance of that mercie quite destroy, Which might by patient Industrie be had? Or, how can he be worthy of that Blessing, Who (knowing how much, lately it hath cost, In bloud and Treasure) would the repossessing Of that deare purchase, for a toy, have lost? And, everlastingly, himselfe undo, To satisfie his Lust, a yeare or two? Who knoweth not, that much more dread you have, Lest of Estate, or Person, you should lose The loved Freedomes; then to be a Slave To him, whose Tyranny, the Soule undoes? For, to that end you Give, you Lend, you Pay; To that intent, strict Covenants you make; To that intent, you sometimes Fast and Pray; To that intent, much Paines and Care you take. Yea, many goodly things to that intent You daily do, and many moe, intend: But, your Peace-offrings, all in vaine are spent, Till you direct them to their proper end; And, till the Peace, for which your Suits you make, Shall be desir'd for Truths, and Mercies sake. Who sees not, that a Peace you now desire For nought, but that you might againe enjoy Your lusts; and, to those Vanities retire, Wherein you did your former dayes employ? Who seeth not, that, like to those Israelites, Whom from th'Ægyptian Bondage GOD redeem'd, You have the pleasing of your Appetites, Much more than your Deliverer esteem'd? Their Garlick, and their Flesh-pots left behind, They thought on more, than on that Servitude, From which they came; and, more than they did mind, Those Wonders, and that Mercie, which GOD shew'd: And, you have acted, as in imitation Of that perverse, and foolish generation. You have forgot, already, to what height Of Tyranny and Pride, the Court was rear'd; What Projects for Oppression, were in sight; What Injuries you felt, and what you fear'd. You seeme to have forgot, to what degree Of Insolence the Prelacie was come: How, generally, you began to be Bewitched, by the Sorceries of Rome. You, have not so observed, as you ought, How neare, unto a helplesse overthrow, You (by your Foes confederacies) were brought, Before their purpose did apparant grow; Nay, you yet heed not, what will soone betide, If, now, from good-beginnings back you slide. But, as afore-said, like the sottish Iewes, (Who, of the Humane-nature, and of You, Are perfect Types) GODS favours you abuse; And, so, your owne Inventions, you pursue. Though like their Fierie-pillar, and their Cloud, A speciall Providence hath been your Guard; An unbeleeving heart, your deeds have show'd; And, you of ev'rie Bug-beare are afeard. Like them (ev'n while the Law to you is giving, And all this Iland, like Mount Sinai smokes) New Worships, and new GODS you are contriving; Like them, you sleight his Benefits, and strokes; And, in your Provocations, are as daring, While he is Rest and Peace, for you preparing. So, you forget, how great your Bondage was, And whereunto you fear'd it might encrease; So, those great Marvailes you still over-passe, Which GOD hath wrought, to perfect your release: So, when by some new Streight, your Faith he tries, You wish that in your Bondage, you had staid: So, your Deliverers, you scandalize; As if by them, your Freedomes were betray'd: So, murmure you, when any thing you lack; So, you, despaire, when carnall props decay; So, ev'rie difficultie turnes you back, And stands like Seas, and Gyants in your way: And, so, through mis-beleefe, your selves deprive Of Blessings, which your Children shall receive. And, thus it comes to passe, because, like them You are a stupid and a foolish Nation, Who your Deliverances do contemne; And, are like them, without consideration. Else, grudge you would not, for that, you are more Imbroyl'd by seeking to preserve your due, And put to greater charges, than before Your Vindication you did first pursue: For, Prudent men, will while they are at ease, Be willingly made sick; and beare the cost Of Physick, for the cure of that disease, Through which, ere long, their lives might else be lost: Yea, ev'rie rustick Seed-man, sowes in hope, (Advent'ring much) e're he receives a crop. You justly might suppose, that Patients wit Much craz'd, that when good physick works upon him, Straight wisheth, he had never taken it; Cries out, that his Physitians have undone him; Because, they made him sick, e're he was so: Drinks, eats, and acts, both what and when he will; Yea, thereby makes himselfe more sick to grow, And causes that which would have cur'd, to kill. Yet, this is your condition: and, if, now, In this distemper'd, and untoward plight, Your kind Physitian had deserted you, (As for your peevishnesse, he justly might) Your labours past, and those you shall bestow, Will prove like Arrowes, from a warped Bow. You mark not, what great wonders God hath wrought, To move your hardned Pharaohs to relent; And that from slaveries, you might be brought, Nor heed you, what your Foes, for you invent. A thousand things, unthought on, you let go, Of consequence, which wrought for you have bin, Since your Deliverer began to show An Outlet, from the Bondage you were in. As, in what dreadfull manner, in one place, He seized by an unseen-messenger, A bold Transgressor (who so daring was, As to provoke the Devill to appeare) And, smoth'red him in loathsome smoke and stink, Whilst he presum'd blasphemous healths to drink. You do not mark, how oftentimes the Plot, Against you layd, hath crossed been by Him, When, else, you had no knowledge thereof got; Nor, to prevent it, either Pow'r, or Time. You have not memorized, as you ought, How, GOD himselfe, when your own strength did faile, For you, against your Enemies hath fought; And made you conquer, when they did prevaile. How wondrously, a Remnant, for a Seed, In Ireland, he preserves: how oft from spoile, Your Garrisons and Armies, he hath freed, When they have been in hazard of a foile: Nor do you mind, how oft, him thank you may, For saving, what, you would have fool'd away. You ponder not, how often he hath sav'd, Where no Salvation was; how neare at hand, He still was found, when you protection crav'd; And, when destruction over-hung the Land. You have not heeded, how the Saplesse-brest Of wither'd Age, (when raging crueltie The child of murth'red Parents had distrest) Did wonderfully, thereto milk supply: Nor, for how many thousand Families, He food provides, whom War hath quite undone: Nor, how his Grace restraines their Poverties, From Outrage, whereinto they else had run; And which, ere long, attempted you will see, Vnlesse more Iust, and Mercifull you bee. You, hardly yet believe, that, in conclusion The mischiefs, by your Adversaries done, Must be the Ground-worke of their own confusion; Or, that your Peace is by this War begun. You mark not, that when first the sottish Dane, Preparing was, your causlesse Foes to aid, GOD, then, to call him to account began, For all that bloud whereon his Throne was laid: Nor how, ev'n then, GOD fastned in his nose The Swedish-hooke, and found him work at home, To shew, that He of Princes doth dispose; And, what of wilfull-Tyrants will become, Though, by permission, for a while, they may The Fooles, or Mad-men, on their stages play. You mark not, with such thankfull observations, As would become you, that, GOD's providence, (Though you are threatned by some other Nations) Hath (by ingagements) kept them yet, from hence. And many other things unheeded are, Which must consid'red be, ere you aright Your hearts, and your affections can prepare, For such a Peace, as will be worth your sight. Yea, many things must be repented too, And much amended, ere you may expect, That either swords, or words this work will do; Or Blowes, or Treaties, bring your wisht effect. The Peace of GOD you never can possesse, But, by attonement, with the GOD of Peace. You, by a Treaty, had a hope to see A Peace concluded on. But how alas! How possibly may that accomplisht be! Till means is found to bring it well to passe? The Mediums to that work, are wanting, yet, By which, the Parties who at variance are, Should reconcile; and they themselves have set Too farre asunder, to be brought so neare. There wants a Third, by whom they should unite: For, most who are imploid as Instruments, To joyne them, in Divisions take delight: And, private-interests, that work prevents; Because, when these, the way to Peace shall take, Themselves obnoxious to the Lawes they make. The chiefest outward-Instruments, whereby To joyne a King and Subjects disunited, Was wont to be that Christian Charity, By which the neighb'ring Princes were invited To mediate, and labour to compose Their diff'rences. As first, by friendly words, And prudent Arguments, perswading those Who seem'd unjustly to have drawne their swords. By threatnings, next: And, if nor argument, Nor intercession, nor sharp menaces Prevail'd; they then, to help the innocent, As they inabled were, would somtimes please; Lest, an unbounded, and usurped pow'r Should all oppresse, and all at last devoure. But you have no such hope; For, all the States, And all the Kings and Princes, near, or farre, Which were your Friends, and your Confederates, Neglecters of this pious duty are. The Swedes, the Germans, and those other Nations, Who really compassionate your griefe, Are so ingag'd, for their own preservations, That, thence you neither can expect reliefe, Nor means of an Attonement. From the Dane, (Your old Oppressor) you long since, had found What he resolv'd; unlesse, the Swede had tane Occasion to imploy him in the Sound: And, should the French, or Spaniard intercede, Against their own Designments, they might plead. Th'Vnited Netherlands, who to pursue This dutie, are oblig'd, beyond them all, And, who (unlesse they prove both false to you, And to themselves) themselves remember shall: Ev'n they have hitherto but only sent Iobs comforters unto you: or, perchance To practise here, some peece of complement, Which they have newly learn'd from Spaine, or France: Ot, else, to see a patterne of that Plague, Which must, from hence, translated thither bee, When they have quite forgotten their old league With you, who spent your bloud, to set them free; When they, in danger were to be enslav'd, As you are now, and, for assistance crav'd. Now, whether these are blinded by some sin That cals for Vengeance; or, by some poore hope, New works on this Iles ruines, to begin; Or, whether Providence hath made that stop, To frustrate such like meanes, that, you might flie To him alone; it doth not yet appeare: But, will ere long. Meanewhile, the certaintie Of this, becometh manifestly cleare; That, GOD suspendeth ev'rie help to Peace, Which forraine Aid, or forraine intercession Are like to add; and, suffers an encrease Of jars at home, which threaten your perdition: For, ev'rie thing essentiall to that blessing, Are, well-nigh, taken out of your possession. Most Circumstances, thereunto pertaining, Are missing too. For, on th'one side, at least, There's not so much as willingnesse remaining, To further what they have in word, profest. The Spheres in which they move, divert them from A true Coujunction; and, from all Aspects, From whence good Influences use to come, Or, any lasting peaceable-effects. It is destructive to their maine Designe, And to their Principles, to make true Peace; Or, with a faithfull purpose, to incline To seek this Islands reall happinesse. Nor should you think such purposes they had, Till, in their course, you see them retrograde. As soon shall he that Westward alway goes, Meet him, that still an Eastward point doth steere, As your two Factions firme together close, Till they, in their chiefe-aimes, approach more neer: For, th'one is bent, the other to inslave; That other, is resolved to be free: The Last, would keep what GOD and Nature gave; The First, would seize, what ought not theirs to be. And, these, from reconcilement are so farre, That, all their kindnesse is but to betray: When most they talk of Peace, they purpose Warre; When they embrace, they meane to stab and slay: And, when they make you think the Warre is done, The greatest mischiefe will be but begun. Beside, as yet, nor th'one, nor th'other side, Nor King, nor People, Commoners, nor Peers, Nor Flocks, nor Shepheards, have the course yet tride, By which you can be saved from your feares. A Treatie may complete it: But, before You venture that, you must be fit to Treat. For, then, the work were half-way done, and more: And, till that be, no step you forward get. In heat of quarrells, nothing done or spoke, Can reconcile: a friends words move them not: The more they talk, the more the peace is broke, Till they their lost consid'ring-caps have got; Till their hot bloud is cool'd, till rage is gone; And, Reason doth examine them alone. Then, peradventure, they with shame will view Their oversights, their furiousnesse repent, Distinguish Truths, from things that are untrue; And, by that quarrell, future jarres prevent. Thus likewise, when GOD, thereto saies Amen, Your Disagreements here, shall have an end: Your Discords will be then allaid agen, And, he that's now a Foe, shall be a Friend. But, you must find, before this can be done, A Preparation, and a Ground-work laid, (With such an alteration wrought upon Your Hearrs) that Reason may be more obey'd: GOD, make this Preparation; For, by none But by himselfe, this work may now be done. When you may hope a Treaty will prevaile, Good Symptoms, you to usher it shall see; Inducing you to hope it shall not faile: And, for a tast, they such as these will be. Both sides will to some Course themselves apply That shall declare their hearts are growing-clean; Themselves they will endeavour to deny; Their tongues will nothing speake, but what they mean. You shall perceive more Justice, to be showne; More Charity among you will appear; They will be meek, who to be proud were knowne; Contentions will be fewer then they were; And, they who on the Publike-Trust attend, Will lesse abuse it, for their private end. A Change, thus wrought; these Virtues, in a while, Will every where, beget themselves esteem: By their esteem the Fire-brands of this Jsle, Will daily more abhominable seem: That loathing of those Monsters will increase The number of true Converts: By that number, The growing of Malignancie will cease, And Newters be awakened from their slumber: By their awakening, such will be affraid Who have not gone malitiously astray: That Feare will quickly make them well apaid To leave their standing, in the sinners way, And, when these from that Station shall be gone, It will bring scorne upon the Scorners Throne. Thus, as at first, Malignancie was bred By ill example, and mis-informations; So, Good-affections, will revive and spread, And strengthen by their changed Conversations. Then, will arise a longing to be free From your Imbroylments; with so true a sight Of present mischiefs, and of what may be, That, in the meanes of Peace, you will delight. And, then, both Parties will be pleas'd to meet On one set day, to fall with humblenesse, For their foule bloudie sins, before GODS feet, Whose Mercie, far exceedes their wickednesse; And he, perhaps, will make that complement, An earnest of your generall assent. When such like inclinations do appear, (Both parties moving on, in some such way, As here is pointed at) they who draw neare At first in generals, will every day, Assent in some particular or other, Till they who now so much divided be, Shall lovingly unite again together, And in one Discipline and Faith agree. But, doubtlesse, not till they themselves deny, And more forbeare, when they negotiate, From seeking in their publike Agencie, To serve and save themselves, before the State; Whose weale, to all men should be dearer, far, Then their estates, their lives, and honours are. Nay, till both Parties do, at least, agree In all those common principles, whereby Humane Societie, preserv'd may be, With Nations Rights, and Christian Libertie; All Treaties will be mischeevous, or vaine, To men adhering to the better Course: For, by such Treatings, Polititians gaine Advantages, to make your being worse. Yea, by that meanes, these find occasions may To gaine, or give intelligence; to make New plots, and friends; to hasten or delay, As cause requires; and, other wayes to take For their availe, which els they had not got: And which true honesty alloweth not. Nor can, in any cause, a Treaty bring More mischief then in your; till on each side The Parties treating, are in ev'ry thing (Thereto pertaining) rightly qualifi'd: Because, when Forraigners alone are Foes, Tis hard corrupting more then one or two; Whereas, here want not multitudes of those, That, willingly, their Countrey would undo. Nay, some among you are so void of reason, To buy their Traytorships; and other some, By conscience, seem obliged to the treason: And, these will to a Treatie never come, To make true reconcilement; but, to gather Advantages, for some new mischief, rather. You are this way, and many other wayes, Corrupted so, so false, and so unfit For Peace desired; and for those assayes, Whereby you may acquire that blessing, yet, That you must cleansed be from that pollution Which brought this curse upon you; and whereby Those means are vainly put in execution, Which might procure a blessed Vnity. There is so little honesty among you, And your discretion is become so small, That they who most apparently do wrong you, (And seek your Souls and Bodies to inthrall) Have more incouragements, to help undo you, Then they, who offer means of safety to you. Instead of being linked fast, in one, Against the common-Foe, you have permitted That band of amity to be undone, Whose preservation had these times befitted. You, that in Fundamentalls do agree, Are so divided about Circumstances, (Which might, at better leisure, setled be) That your Destroyers projects it advances: And, if with speed you cement not the breaches, That which (ere long) must thereupon ensue, Experience (which the veriest ideots teaches;) Will, to your greater sorrow, daily shew; Till you of all, are by those foes despoil'd, Whom you by good attonement might have foil'd. You are a fickle, and inconstant Nation, Your serious promises deserve no trust; Your words are full of base dissimulation, Your thoughts are vanity, your deeds unjust. Your vertues are but few, your vices many; Great is your Folly, and your Wisdome small; Your Principles are such (if you have any) That, from your best resolves you quickly fall. With jealousies, each other you pursue; You misbelieve, and find, as you believ'd: You, nor to GOD, nor men continue true: And, therefore, of much comfort are bereav'd, Which by their friendship might have been possest, Who keep to you, that Faith which they profest. Betwixt you, and your Brethren of the North, The seeds of Discord secretly are sown: Much paine some take to make them tillow forth, Dissentions coales in ev'ry place are thrown; And these by Folly, and by Malice, too, So wilfully are blown by either side, So scattered, and tossed to and fro, And so much fewell is to them appli'd; That, if the patience of the Stottish-Nation Exceed not Common-measure: If more true They prove not to their Vowes, their Protestations, And Christian-principles, than some of You, A worse Division will betwixt you spring, Than this, between the People and the King. For, this will in another Age abate, But, that, unless GODS grace prevent it shall, Will grow into an everlasting hate, Or, bring a speedy ruine on you all. Now therefore, in both Nations, let those few Who faithfull are, firme in their Faith abide. Now, let them to their Principles be true; Now, let the Patience of the Saints be tri'd. His last great Batt'rie, ANTICHRIST now reares, His deepest Mines, against you sinking be, His pow'rfull Army, mustred now appeares, His chiefest Cunning, now, employeth he. Oh! let him not by Force your Strength dis-joyne, Nor, by his fraud, your Counsels undermine. But, let your Faith and Courage so prevaile, That you may better Fixed-Stars appeare, Than they, who daily by the Dragons-Taile, Are smitten, or affrighted from their Spheare; That, you may those Elected-Ones be found, Who cannot by Deceivers, be deceiv'd; That, with those Conquerours you may be crown'd, Who shall not of their Garlands be bereav'd: That, of the Kingdome, seizure you may take, Which GOD, on Perseverers doth bestow; And, not be shut from thence, by looking back, When you have set your hands unto the plough. In this Back-sliding, some already are: Some, nearer to it, than they are aware. For, so imprudent are Men discontent, That, to avenge their personall neglects, Complaints for private injuries, they vent As Nationall-affronts, and dis-respects; Whereas, it is apparent ev'rie day, That, many members of each sev'rall Nation, Do suffer, by their owne, as much as they, In Person, in Estate, and Reputation: And, that both Nations, mutually have showne, (Vnlesse, perhaps, among the baser sort) As loving a respect as to their owne, And, therefore, let not Prudent-men retort Mistaken wrongs; or quarrels be begun 'Twixt them, for that, which Fooles and Knaves have done. Let not those jealousies, which were perchance Devis'd by them, who in your spoiles delight, Make you, imprudently, their ends advance, And you, to their Advantage, dis-unite. If some of them, discourtesies have showne, To some of yours; or, injuries have done; It is no more than you, unto your owne Have offred oft, since first this War begun. An Army cannot possibly be free From all Injustice; and, yet, oftentimes Ill-will, and men who dis-contented be, Will make complaints, much larger than the crimes. But cursed be their malice, and their tongues, Who Nations would divide for private wrongs. Your Fathers felt, and some of you have heard, The Deadly-Fewds, betweene you heretofore; Which, if your owne well-being you regard, Would make you glad it might be so no more: And entertaine, and cherish with all dearnesse, The brotherly Affection, which that Nation Hath late exprest; and with a true sincerenesse, Be carefull of your mutuall preservation. Yea, if the sons of Belial, and of Blindnesse, On either Partie, rightly understood, How greatly, to perpetuate this kindnesse Between the Nations, it concernes their good, (Ev'n in those outward things which they respect) They would not your dis-union, so project. Believe it, this is not the way to Peace, But rather, to an never-ending war; And likelier new troubles to increase Then set a period unto those that are. And, they who willingly shall tind such flames, Or, wilfully foment them, merit well To be esteem'd (to their perpetuall shames) The Plagues of earth, and Fierbrands of hell. For, of your Scottish-Brethren, wherefore, now, Yee English-Britaines, are ye jealous growne, Who have exprest more faithfulnesse to you, Then you your selves, unto your selves have shown? Or, wherein have they seemingly abus'd Your trust, whereof, they may not be excus'd? They would appeare to be confided in With lesse distrust, if ever you had heard On what conditions, they allur'd have bin To be dishonourable, for reward. For, when the Prelates-War had them constrain'd To arme themselves against the superstitions Intruded on them; when they had regain'd Their Peace with honour, and on good conditions; And, when your Army could have been content Vnnat'rally (on promise of reward) To turne their Swords upon this Parliament, (And so had surely done, had they not fear'd The Scots, then, on their Rear) they were the men who kept you from the mischeef purpos'd then. Had they been trustlesse; or, had aim'd at ends, As base as many of your own have had; Your Foe, e're this, had done what he intends: And you and yours, perhaps, had slaves been made. For, to allure them, four brave Northerne Shires Should have annexed been to Scottish-ground: To beare expences (and to pay Arreares) A paune to be three hundred thousand pound In Jewells, was design'd. York, should have had The Soveraigne-Seat of royall-Residence; The Scottish Generall, should have been made The chiefe of both your Armies; and, the Prince In Scotland, should have had his education; All which, together, seem'd a strong temptation. Yet, more was offred: For, to each Commander Revenue, Office, yea, and Honour too Was promis'd; and th'unvaluable plunder Of London, to both Armies: What to do? To force the Parliament, to make the King A Monarch absolute; and you, and your, Into perpetuall slavery to bring, By an ill-gotten Arbitrary power. But, these temptations, their brave minds abhor'd: Of which their noblenesse, this VOICE shall be An everlasting Trophee, and Record; Wherein, these times, and times to come, shall see How, yee to sale were offred; and, how these Disdain'd to thrive, by base advantages. If they be faithlesse, and you shall be true, GOD, will with shame and vengeance send them home. If, you unfaithfully your Vowes pursue, Possessors of your Land they shall become. In spight of all your policies and power, Here, they shall settle; whither they were set, To do the work of GOD (as well as your) Who will requite the kindnesse you forget. But, if without hypocrisie and guiles, You, Brethren-like, shall strengthen one another, In setting up his Throne, within these Isles, By, and in whom, you seem, now, knit together; Both, shall thereby, that happinesse enjoy, Which all the powers on Earth, shall not destroy. Look therefore, well about you, and persever In your vow'd union: For, the maine designe Is to divide you; and, to that indeavour Your Foes, with all their Faculties combine. Yea, and of such like projects, there are other, Through levitie, or malice so promoted, As if to ruine these three Realmes together, It were almost unanimously voted. No Chronicle hath showne; no age hath seen An Empire so divided, and yet stand; Or that a Nation so corrupt hath been, Whose desolation was not near at hand. And, if you shall escape it; be it knowne To all now living, and that shall be borne, A greater Mercie never was bestowne On any Kingdome since a Crown was worne: And that no Nations, who so much professe In outward show, did ere deserve it lesse. Although by vowes, and dutie you are tide, Yet, you are carelesse in pursuing either; And play at fast, and loose on ev'ry side, Fair seeming friends to both, but, true to neither. He, that's within your Covenants, and conceives Himselfe ingaged, by those Obligations, To bring to triall those whom he believes Injurious to the safety of these Nations; Oft into greater danger thereby falls, Of secret mischiefs, of reproofs, or troubles, Then they whom justly to account he calls: And, by this meanes, your Foe his power doubles, Takes courage, and accomplisheth his ends, By making you to ruine your own friends. 'Tis, oft, more safe, to let the Commonweale Be ruin'd, or betraid, then to oppose A Traytor; or with freedome to reveale That, which your vowes oblige you to disclose. Your personall immunities, of late, Are so insisted on, that many feare The Publike-Priviledge to vindicate; Least they Infringers of the first appeare. And, if there be not some provisions made, Whereby free-men their minds may freely say, When probable suspitions they have had, That some intrusted, do their trust betray, Your Priviledged Persons, will advance Their freedomes to the Publike hinderance. Through some obstructions, your most noble Court Which is the Sanctuary, whereunto Oppressed men, by multitudes resort, Yeelds lesse reliefe, then it had wont to do. For, publike Greevances are so increast, That, time and leasure, hardly can be gain'd, To heare how men are privately opprest, Till they are quite undone who have complain'd: Beside (which in Committees oft is done) By making friends, to come, or keep away, Vnwarranted advantages are won, To wrong the Truth, or Justice, to delay, Thus, when the Peeres or Commons are but few, A mischiefe unexpected may ensue. For, when Reports or Motions should be made, If they who make them will deceitfull prove, Occasions doubtlesse, may be watch'd, and had, Injurously both to report and move; Since they who shall report (if to their choice The times be left) may their designes propose, And get it passed by a Major-Voice, E're their appearing, who the same oppose. Yea, 'tis nor hard nor strange to watch and wait, A week or two, for such advantages, And gaine a Vote for that by this deceit, Which in a Full-Assembly would displease. Thus, by mans wickednesse, a mischiefe springs, From justest Courts, and from the noblest things. And, if you soone returne not from your height, Of Falshood and Injustice, that which was Your Idoll (and the Glorie of your might) Your hope of bringing mightie things to passe; Ev'n, that shall also fail you, in the end: That, shall augment your manifold vexations: That, shall become unable to defend, Or save it selfe, among your desperations. Nay, that, shall by degrees it selfe corrupt To such a Monster, as will fright you more, More grieve, and more your quiet interrupt, Than all oppressing Tyrants heretofore. For, when in sinning, men presumptuous grow, GOD makes their strength to be their overthrow. It was not meerly in the Government By Kingship, that you were opprest of late: It was not that, which brought the Detriment Dilacerating so, both Church and State. The Princes errours, and the Peoples crimes, (Increasing by their aiding of each other In wickednesse) have made them, in these times, A mutuall scourge; and both now smart together. By godlesse counsells you misled your King: Then kept him, standing in the sinners way: And to the scorners throne him now you bring; Whereon if once he settle (as he may, If God prevent not) you, as yet, but see Beginnings of those plagues that felt must be. Vnlesse by penitence you break off fin, Your Parliamentall Members (when long sitting, And fewnesse of the number, shall bring in Both meanes, and opportunity, begetting Such knowledge of each other, as is now In some Committees) shall much represent The Lands Corruptions; and make perfect show By whom, and from what body they were sent. For, then on Priviledges to insist Meer-personall, more then on Publike-Right: To say their pleasures; and do what they lift, In Lawes contempt, and Equities despight; Shall grow in use, till you and they shall run Another Course to be, yet, more undone. You, then, shall see (though under other notions) Your old Oppressions to return again: As much false-play for profit and promotions, As when you to your King, did first complain: Then, you shall see your monstrous-high-Commission, Your Councell-Table, your Star-Chamber too, New-shapes assuming to their old Condition, Revive, and act as they had wont to do. That Insolence, that Pride Prelaticall, Those corporall and ghostly Tyrannies, Which in your Clergie lately had a fall, Shall rise again, cloth'd with a new disguise, And act, what they who plaid before did mean, Although they change their Habits, and the Scœne. For, then some Priestlings, who as guiltie are Of your Divisions, as the Prelates-traine, (First kindling, and fomenting, still, this warre, As much as they) will make their meanings plaine. Yea, by divisions, and by subdividing, According as their maine designe requires, Opposing some, and with some other siding, (As best may serve to compasse their desires) Shall Schismes, Sects, and Fancies multiply. Beyond compute; and from the truth shall steal So many hearts by fained sanctitie, By counterfeited honestie and zeale, That, all your other Foes shall not disease Your private, and the publike Rest, like these. For, (though enacted-Law, doth now of late From Secular-employments them exclude) To intermeddle with Affaires of State, They will, by many meanes, themselves intrude. By gath'ring Parties, they will plots contrive, To make those greatest, who will them obey; To make them rich, by whom they hope to thrive, And to such ends will study, preach, and pray; Joyne hands, sollicite, covenant, petition; (The Publike-good, still their chiefe aime pretending) And, whatsoever stands in opposition To their Designe, shall want no such commending, As floweth from implacable despite, Or, from the malice of an Hypocrite. And, if e're long, there be not some endeavour, To keep them to their Calling, (and to bound Their meddling with Lay-matters) you shall never Be free from Faction, while the Spheres go round. Like Salamanders, these can never live, But in a Flame; nor, long themselves conforme To any Reformation: For, they thrive In Changes best, and swim best in a Storme. And, many diffring Sects of these there are; Some to an Independancie incline, Some to a Presbyterian-way adhere; Yet, really, themselves to neither joyne: But, rather, take advantage to make use Of that, which to their ends, may best conduce. To limit these to some Parochiall Charge, Were to imprison them: For, they well know From Congregations gather'd up at large, What Profits, and Advantages do flow. A Parish Income, though they largely grant Both Tythes and Pensions, is but verie small, Compar'd to what that Priest itinerant, Can gather up, who hath no bounds at all. A Parish is too narrow for his Pride, Or Avarice: And, in one place, perchance, Should he be long compelled to reside, He could not so conceale his ignorance, Or cover failings in his Conversation, As, by an Unconfined-Congregation. Had these been regulated, and reduc'd, To that Conformitie, which Reason would, The Simple had not then been so seduc'd: Nor, had the Common-People so been fool'd. Had these, and their Antagonists been charm'd By prudent Discipline, and made agree, Your King and Parliament had not been arm'd Against each other, as this day they be. Had these been conjur'd downe; that Pietie, That Prudent-meeknesse, and sweet Moderation, By which a Part of that Fraternitie Doth wrestle for a blessing on this Nation, Should more be honour'd; and, ere long, prevaile, For curing of those Plagues which they bewaile. For, these, oft suffer the deserved blame Of Demas and Diotrophes; and share, (By being of their Calling) in their shame, When of their Faults they no way guiltie are. And, these, are they, whose Prayers and Examples, Whose good advice, and whose well-temper'd Zeale Shall keep your State, your Cities, and your Temples From desolation, and your Plague-sore heale. If therefore, Wit profane, or Scurrile tongue Shall any of our censurings apply, To do their worth or innocencie wrong, Let it redound to their owne infamie: Let ev'rie check, from which they shall be free, An augmentation to their honour be. And, let it not discourage them, a whit, That, now, those temp'rall Dignities are gone, Which, oft, in their possessors, pride beget, And, really, are honour unto none; Since, by their lives, and doctrines, they may more Their Persons and their Callings dignifie, Then Wealth and Titles have done, heretofore, And, reach true honours highest pitch thereby: For, who, when Prelacie did highest seem, Were honour'd by the People, or the Peers, With more unfain'd affection and esteem, Then they are now, whom reall worth endeers? Oh! let this honour still on them attend; And, let their counsels move you to amend. For, every one hath erred in his wayes; King, Priest and People have alike misgone; As doth the Flock, ev'n so the Shepheard strayes; And, there is no man perfect, no not one. It is not in the pow'r of words to tell, How farre below esteeme your vertues are: Or, how in wickednesse you would excell, If wholly left, to your own selves, you were. Could you but look into your hearts, and view How many villanies those cavernes hide, Beside all those, which words and deeds do shew, Or, may by circumstances, be descride; You could not but unfainedly confesse, That you are, yet, uncapable of peace. Could you permit your blinded eyes to heed, How, while you smart, you multiply offence; How, that, which awfull penitence should breed, Hath changed errour, into impudence: Could you perceive, before it were too late, How fast you fell away, since you began To faile in your professions to the State; And, to be faithlesse, both to GOD, and Man; You would abhorre your selves, and be affraid Your soules, by transmigration, would ere long, Passe into sottish Beasts: For, you have straid Beyond that blockishnesse which is among The noblest Brutes; and, hardly do escape With so much of true manhood, as the shape. There is no pittie of the Fatherlesse, Or, of the poore afflicted Widdowes teares; No charitable heed of their distresse, Whose miserie, most evident appears. They, who have gladly, lent, and spent, and given Goods, Blood, and best-assistance, to defend The Common-safety, (till they have been driven To want of Bread) have hardly found a friend: Some other, who oft hazzarded their lives, For your protection (and have quite undone Their dearest Children, and beloved Wives, To do you service) have been look'd upon Without regard; and worse, by far, have sped Then they, who nothing have contributed. Nay (would it were but so) their, and your Foes, By your injustice, or your heedlesnesse, Finde meanes to spatter, and to ruine those, Whom, to defend, you did (with vowes) professe. And (though their deeds have through this Isle proclaim'd Their faithfulnesse) you gladly suffer them By cunning whisperers, to be defam'd; And, Falshoods words, Truths actions, to condemn Before due trialls, you (through Avarice, Or, Envie) with contentednesse, can heare Desert traduc'd; and, with such prejudice, Receive Detractions, as if glad you were, Of such false Quittances, to make a show Of having paid that debt which, yet, you owe. It is, indeed, the Polititians way, Thus, to requite: And, therefore, he that brings Obligements, greater then discharge they may, On thanklesse Nations, or on fathlesse Kings, Instead of due reward, shall be repaid With causlesse jealousies, and with suspect, Of having either failed, or betraid Their Trust, by falshood; or, by some neglect. And, then, it must a Mercie be believ'd, If He, for all the service he hath done, (In lieu of what he thought to have receiv'd) With life and losse of honour, may be gone: And, this, will, now, the portions be of some Whom better usage, better will become. And, how can GOD have peace with such a Nation, In which this basenesse, and this falshood lurks, Which is rejected with much detestation Among the brutish Salvages and Turks? Or, how can you to other men be true, Who to your selves are false, as may appear By many practices, which you pursue, Through wilfulnesse, through follie, or through feare? For, whosoever tyranny defends, And sets himselfe that Party to oppose Which for the Publike Libertie contends, Betrayeth his own person to his Foes: Or (if perchance, his person free he saves) Himselfe, in his Posterity inslaves. Nay, you, who seem the better part to take, Ev'n you, are to your selves, as false as they: The Price of blood, a thing of nought you make, And complement Advantages away. Your Passes, and Protections, you bestow, Not, as though to your safety they pertain'd; But rather, your Authority to show, Who gave them; Or, that profit might be gain'd To Clarks, and Secretaries. And, your care Is not, at all times, how you may supply A place of Trust, with such as fathfull are; Or, fittest for the States necessitie: But, soonest they, those favours do obtain, Who sell the Publike for their private gain. Nor Ablenesse their duty to discharge, Nor losse, nor suffrings, for the common Cause, Nor of Integrity, good proofes at large, Respect to such a mans preferment drawes: Nay, he that by a generall assent Was nominated, (and petition'd for) Without his seeking, in the Parliament, To services of Trust; and, which is more, Had these imployments, also, recommended By Order thence; hath, now, a year unheard For answer, from those Referrees attended, Without so much as hope of their regard: Because, though to the Publike-weale it tends, 'Tis found it will disprofit private friends. Your Indiscreet Indulgence, suffers those Who loose their Bloud, and Liberties for you, To lie in worse condition, then your Foes, To whom an equall usage seemeth due. Yea, while in loathsome dungeons, they remain, Who captivated in your service were, Sweet Lodgings and respect their Foes obtain, When in your Quarters they imprison'd are. By which unequallnesse, (till their side please To show more mercy) much discouragement, Your Partie findes; and, disadvantages Which moderate severenesse might prevent: And, you more Cruelty, then Mercie show, When Mercy you on Cruell-men bestow. He that to ruine you no spight hath spar'd, If he submit, although but to deceive you, Shall find more courtesie, and more regard, Then he, who never left, nor meanes to leave you. He, that with Outrage hath your townes embroil'd, He, that hath in your bloud, his hands imbrew'd, Your friends of their chiefe livelihood despoil'd, And, to his utmost power, that course pursu'd: He, if for favour (though constrain'd) he come, Shall not alone finde meanes to set him free, With his Possessions, for a triviall summe: But also quickly countenanced be With Friends, and Favours, him inabling, too, Your faithful'st friends, and servants to undo. False to your selves you are, in not assaying To execute the fulnesse of your power, In these Extremities; and, in delaying To take those Freedomes which are justly your. The Members of your Body wasted are; And, such as are of that consumption glad, (Vnlesse prevented) will the cure defer, Vntill it cannot possibly be had. By raising feares of some supposed-thing, Which neither is, nor was, nor shall be done, Vpon your selves, you many mischiefs bring, Which by a prudent-Stoutnesse you may shun: For, when you make an unexpected pawse, You weaken your Assistants, and your Cause. You act not out your parts, as if you thought, A Tragedie in earnest, now, were plaid; Or, that upon the Combat to be fought, The Triall of your whole estates were laid: For, to advance a frivolous designe, To please a knave, that is a friend in show, To feed some lust, whereto they do incline, Or, shun the fury of a feared Foe; Advantages you daily fool away, Which by no humane pow'r can be recal'd; Eternitie, you venture for a day, And, when you might with brasse be double wal'd, You seek to fortifie the Kingdomes Cause With paper-works, with rotten sticks, and strawes. Those Places and Imployments, whence arise The greatest profit, rarely are confer'd, With conscionable care of their supplies, By faithfull men: but, thither are prefer'd Those, rather, whose chief aimes are how to make Their private Fortunes; and, to that effect Know how to move; and how to give or take, To gaine themselves advantage, and respect. Yea, though there be suspitions, and perchance, Good evidences too, that some of these The Cause of your opposers, will advance (When they an opportunitie may seize) To Offices of Trust, you these commend, Before your suffering and deserving Friend. Who their estates have now increased most, But, they who for the publike ventur'd least? Whose paiments and preferments more are crost, Then their, who (to their power) have serv'd you best? In what Committees now, or in what Shires, Are not, this day, a multitude of those, Whose faithfulnesse undoubtedly appeares, Disabled, and discourag'd, by their Foes? How gen'rally do you in ev'ry place, Begin, well-known Malignants, now, to trust With your Affaires? And, suffer, with disgrace, True Patriots from imployment to be thrust? And, by this madnesse, how are you betraid? How open to destruction are you laid? They, who were first in Armes, for your defence; Who, first, their Free-will-Offerings to you brought; And have continu'd faithfull, ever since, Ev'n they are now, unserviceable thought. Contrariwise, they, who at first refused To lend you aid, in Person, or in Pay, They, who in word and deed, your cause abused (And are unfaithfull to you to this day) Ev'n they have now insinuated so By helpe of their Protectors: And, of these So over-confident you daily grow, That your best friends, you ruine, and displease; And, on your selves a greater hazzard bring, Then all the armed Forces of the King. For, those accursed Vipers, are with you, So intermingled in your consultations, (Nay, rather, so incorporated now, In private, and in State negotiations) That, by a miracle it must be done, If any good Designe to passe be brought, Or, for the publike-safetie be begun, Which will not, e're performed, come to nought: And, if you are not pleas'd to have it so Why did you? and why do you still, permit, Those men whom faultring (if not false) you know, In Counsell, ev'ry day, with you to to sit? And, why for those, do you your Friends neglect, Vnlesse your own perdition you affect? Why else when Forts, or Forces to command, On which the Publike-safety much depends, Do you commit them rather to their hand, Whom neither proofe, nor likelihood, commends, To such a Trust? Why not unto their care And keeping rather, who have courage showne? Of whose fidelitie, good proofes appear? And whose experience hath been wel made known? This could not be, but that you do preferre Your sons, your nephewes, and your friends, before The Publike-weale, or els perswaded are That, your Destruction will afflict the more, Vnlesse, your own devises help undo you; Or, some who are both near, and deare unto you. How can there be among you those foundations, Whereon, your Peace or Safety, may erect, While most men, for their own accommodations Designments to the Publike losse, project? And, while to compasse their desired ends, They do not onely mischief, and delude Themselves, their kindred, neighbourhood, and friends, Or mis-inform the brainlesse multitude; But, by their cunning, also do contrive Those Engines, which good Discipline deface; The State into unstable postures drive, Raise jarres, and jealousies in every place; And spread abroad the Devils Axioms too, The unitie of Doctrine to undo. These Engineers, your power infeeble more, And weaken more your hands, then all yet done, By other adversaries heretofore, Since this unhappie Warfare first begun. These, while to build among you they pretended, As partners in the work of Reformation, Have secretlie their private Aimes befriended, With hindrance to your wished Restauration. Sanballats, and Tobiahs, you have had, Who, by dissembling with you, to unite Have rent you from your selves; and, thereby made Both Parties feel the common Foes despight; To be each others whip, and make the Truth A theame of scorne, in everie drunkards mouth. There are so manie failings in the best, Such needlesse, and such wilfull breach of Lawes; So carelesse are you, of your Faith profest, To those, who have been faithfull in your Cause; So hath your Falshood, and your follie blended Both right and wrong, both good and ill together, That, both must be opposed or defended; Or, els you must declare your selves for neither. And (whether with the one, or t'other side You shall partake, or for a Newter, stand) No humane wisdom, can for you provide, A being, with true safety, in this Land: So little wit, hath ordered this Place, So little honesty, so little grace. And, these great mischeifs rose, from giving way For every man, at pleasure, to deface Those Out-works, which (though faultie) were a stay Not uselesse, till some better came in place. For, he that would prevent an inundation (By false-built Sea-banks) lets not every one Teare down the Piles, and breake the old Foundation, Lest that which he would make, might be undone: Nor for a Cobler, or a Fidler, sends; But, men experienc'd in such works, doth call; And, with such warinesse the fault amends, That, no disaster may, mean-while, befall: And, that the Old-worke, and the New-worke, may Begin, and end together, in one day. You thus proceeded not, but (with more heat Then prudence, hurrying on) in hast, you tore The wharfage down; ev'n while the floods did threat To drowne the fields, and Billowes rent the shore. The furious Souldier was, with commendation, Permitted to reforme, as he thought fit; (Forbidding or affording toleration, According to the modell of his wit) And, he that was not mad enough to run Their wildgoose-chase, and set the world on fire, To suffer by suspition, streight, begun; And, forc'd was, from imployment to retire, As not right principled, or drawne aside, By Balaams wages; or, unsanctifi'd. And, these Reformers, not enough content, To carve out Discipline, as they shall please, (And Doctrine too) will on the Government, Vnlesse it be prevented, shortlie seize. For, having no Foundation, like a feather, Which from the bodie of a Fowle is torne. They to and fro, are turn'd with everie weather; Else, up and down, still wrestlesly are borne. And, by these foolish Fires, ev'n as you see By shining-vapours, rising in the night, Mis-led from safe high-waies, poore people be, To fall in Pits, and Ponds, by their false light; So these, and other, have by their delusions, Brought on these Nations, mischieves, and confusions. And these confusions, not alone befall The Civill State; but, have disord'red so Your Discipline Ecclesiasticall, That Church affaires, are out of order too. Each one sets up their private Idoll, there. That man, contends for this; this man, for that. Some, would have new things; some, for old things are, Some, would have somthing, but they know not what. Some, care not what they have: and some there be, That would have nothing, which might them confine, In doing, or believing; but, live free In ev'rie thing, a perfect Libertine. And, most, in such a posture do appeare, As if the Towre of Babell raising were. Some, to no Congregation, will repaire, In which their duties are extemporarie; As if (because some call vaine bablings, praier) No man possest that guift in ordinarie. Some, do abhorre Set-Formes; as if they thought The Spirit, whereby they were first indighted, Dispis'd the words, which by it selfe were taught, If more then once, though with true zeale recited. Some, care not how GODS Fields are over-grown With Briars, and Thornes; some others, are so strict, That, for his Vineyards, they no place will owne, But those, from whence all weeds, and stones, are pickt; As if they, for a Church, allowed not, What hath a scarre, a wrinkle, or a spot. A Militarie-Church, was well exprest, In ancient Hieroglyphicke, by the Moone; To shew, that when her light was at the best, (And when her brightest glorie she puts on) Some shadowes, or some Waynings, will declare, That, in this world, she hath not her perfection: And, that the Sun, from whom her beauties are, Conveigheth light unto her, by reflection. Somtime, that Sun, doth hide his face away, Lest men ascribe to Her, what is His due: Somtime, her proper motions, her convey Too high, or els, too farre, beyond the view Of private-spirits: And, somtime, from sight Earths Globe, and somtime Clouds, obscure her light. Which, many, not consid'ring, are offended Without a cause; and indiscreetly marre That Beauty, which to polish they pretended; And 'twixt her Members, raise intestine warre. Some Weeds, and Corne, are in the blade so like, That many Weeders have deceived bin; And, oftentimes, good corne away do pick, And make the crop, at harvest, very thin. A spotlesse Church, or perfect Disciplines Go seek at None-such: For, they are not found In any place, between the Tropick-Lines, Or any where, upon this earthly Round; Though some have shaped modells, in their braine, Of that, whereto, they never shall attaine. On speculations, these have doted so, (Which their own Fancies forme) that, they have lost The Body of Religion; and let go That Forme thereof, which must enshrine the Ghost. And, he (who being in the flesh) believes The soule of Worship can retained be, Or known, without a Forme, himselfe deceives; Yea others, with himselfe, deceiveth he: And, wanders (restlesse) in perpetuall motion, In quest of empty-shades; and to pursue Each flitting dreame, and ev'ry changing Notion, Which comes within his intellectuall view: Till Pride, upon his Fantasie, begets High thoughts of his own light, and in his brest Stirres up, and kindles those distemper'd heats, That keep the mind and body without rest; And, then perchance, he to a meteor growes, Which Fooles, to be a Starre, a while, suppose. But, if you mark such well, their new-borne-blaze Is quickly out; and you shall see, ere long, Some Evills follow, whereof they were Cause As well as Signes. And take you this, among Your Notes; that, when your Marches furious be, Like Jehu's, in Religions reformation; (And so pursu'd, as if you said, Come see Our zeale for GOD) that, but for ostentation, Or, for your own advancements, you become So zealous: and, that (when you execute GOD's mandates, Jehu-like) you, for the same Shall tast, of his false zeale, the bitter-fruit; That, other men may learn, his will to do, For his owne sake; and, with due meeknesse too. No few disasters had prevented bin, If in the Worke now doing, you had learn'd With whether part, 'twas fittest to begin: Which might in GOD's own works have been discern'd: For, though this World, in worth inferiour be To Man; and, though the Body be below The soule, in value; yet, created He The meanest of these first: And, that may show How men should work. For, had Man been created Before the World; or, had the Soule been made Before the Body, where had they been seated, To exercise the Faculties they had? Though noblest works should first be thought upon, Sometime, a meaner work should first be done. A Common-wealths, blest being, doth depend Vpon the Church: the Churches Reformation, You, therefore, principally should intend: And yet, your zeale may merit commendation, Though to reforme the Civill-government You first begin, and waive a while the other; If there shall happen some such accident, As hinders the reforming both together. Else, peradventure, while you are contriving, Your Forme of Discipline, there may begin A mischiefe, not alone of Peace depriving, But, of a Countrey to professe it in: And, so, with you it hath almost succeeded; Because, this freedome was not timely heeded. For, had you tim'd, and ordered aright The Civill-Part; and, therewith brought along The Church-Affaires (as by degrees you might) The Work had prov'd lesse grievous, and more strong. Or, had true Prudencie directed Zeale First, to reforme some things pertaining to The safe well-being of the Common-weale; Both, had not been, at once, distracted so. And, yet, in this, the wisdome of the State Deserves no check; but, rather, that Defection Throughout the Land, which doth irregulate The Works in hand, and keep them from perfection, By multipli'd Obstructions; and, sometime, By streightning, and necessitating them. For, such is your corruption and your folly, So false and hypocriticall you are; So brutishly profane, and so unholy, (Though you Religious-Nations would appeare) That, had your temp'rall grievances been eas'd, And all those Priviledges been secur'd, For which, to be at cost, you yet are pleas'd, (And many Deaths and dangers have endur'd) Most would have hazarded nor life, nor limb, Nor Goods nor paines, the Church to vindicate From her enthralments; but, to sink or swim, Had left her in a deplorable state: And, therefore, GOD permitted the pursuit Of Counsells, which have brought forth bitter fruit. Ev'n as a Worldling, who hath spent his dayes In carnall Pleasures; and hath partner bin With lewd Companions, in their wicked wayes, (And in the practice of each crying sin) When he doth feele the stroke of some disease Portending Death; and that the self-same houre Those horrours on his conscience also seize, Which threaten Soule and Body to devoure; Desire of Life, and fearfulnesse to die Distracts him so, that he at once for aid, Both from Physitians, and Divines doth crie; And, having both, becometh so dismaid, That he receiveth benefit from neither: But, hazards Soule and Body both together. So, while you laboured at once to heale The desperate Diseases, which of late Endangered both Church and Common-weale; Such longings, then, your double-zeale begate, To cure them both together; and so strove Your Zelots, that, from both at once, they mought The Cause of their distemperatures remove, That, great Confusions upon both, are brought: Yea, both of them, are now exposed more To scandals, losses, errours, perturbations, And hazards of destruction, than before: That, whether now you seek their preservations Together or apart, you shall not, yet, Obtaine that blessing, which you hope to get. For, you must first be cleared of the sin, Which hinders from enjoying your desire: And, that which lately might have cleansed bin With water, must be purged now with fire. Yea, since your follies and your sins have brought Those great Confusions both on Church and State, For which the meanes, that might their cure have wrought, Are now too feeble, and will come too late; Since, into such a Chaos all is changed, That, all endeavours usefull heretofore, Have, daily, you from Concord, more estranged, And made your mischiefes, and your sorrowes more, No ordinary-course, can set you free From those distractions, wherein, now, you be. This, being knowne (and in what great distresse You plunged are) to you it appertaines With penitencie, humbly to addresse Your suits to him, in whom your help remaines. And ere you make approaches to his Throne, There must be (as was told you) some purgation, From those omissions, and those deeds mis-done, Which make your prayers an abhomination. The Zimri's and the Cosbi's of the time, Of whose uncleannesse and whose impudence, You talk of, yet, but as a Veniall crime, Or, laugh at, as a triviall offence, Must with more zeale (more speed) receive their due; Or, else, their sins, GOD shall avenge on you. For, these are so impure, that, in their Sin, They are unsatisfi'd, unlesse the same Hath with some circumstances acted bin, Which proves them double-guiltie, without shame. They are not pleas'd in Simple-Fornication, Vnlesse thereto, Adulteries they add; Nor seemes that, now, sufficient violation Of Chastitie, unlesse, the Crime be made, Yet more abhominable, by beguiling Some Innocent; or else by (offring force) The Bed of Honour, with bold vaunts defiling: Nay, there is found among you (if not worse) Vncleannesse more unmanly, and more strange; Adult'ries by consent, and by exchange. But, these are the defilements of your Peace, Where yet they have not felt the rage of War; Where, yet, the Course of Justice doth not cease, And where great shewes of Pietie yet are. And, if such impudence may there be found; If there, you so corrupt already grow, Oh! how do those Uncleannesses abound, Where cruell Outrage her grim face doth show? Sure words are insufficient to expresse The Rapes, the Ravishments, and loathsome sins, Where War gives way to all Vnrulinesse, And Tyranny and Lust the conquest wins: When sin and impudence is acted there, Where Justice on her seats doth yet appeare. Behold, this day, ev'n whilst with Desolation, The Land is threatned, you have now let in, A crying wickednesse, which to this Nation, Was ever thought so hatefull to have bin; That, though among the Jewes, a Law they had, Inflicting Death upon it, you have none; Because, a Law is verie rarely made, Concerning things unlikely to be done. Who would have thought, there being neither Beare, Nor Wolfe, nor Lyon on your English ground, To seize upon your little Children there, That many Beasts and Monsters should be found, In humane shape, to steale and beare away Your Infants, whilst before your doores they play? Who would have thought, that for so small a price, So many, could so quickly have been got, To joyne in perpetrating of a Vice, So horrible, and yet abhor it not? That, their hard hearts could heare poore Children crie Vpon their fathers, or their mothers name, Till, peradventure, in an agonie Of extreme passion, livelesse they became. Or (which is worse) preserv'd them, to be sent To Bondage, whilst their Parents (almost wild) Were left in everlasting discontent, By musing, on their lost-beloved-child? This Crueltie hath in your streets been seen; Thus high, have your corruptions heightned been. In these sad times, while GODS afflicting hand Lies heavie on you, and with sword and fire, Pursues, through ev'rie Corner of the Land; And, reall Penitencie doth require. In stead thereof, the People now begins To grow more daring, and to practise crimes (Beside the old, or Epidemick sins) Which were unheard of here, in former times. Blasphemous Heresie among you growes, Like Sprouts at Spring-tide, from a new lopt tree: And, so detestable, are some of those, That, pious men afraid to name them be: Lest they, who love the sinfulnesse of Sin, Should, thereby, let such mischiefes further in. Death, was the punishment, which for this crime Was judged by the Law of Moses due; And, well it would become you at this time, That Law, among these Nations to renue. And if you should observe, how little sense Of Perjurie, men seeme to have of late; And what bold use is made of that Offence, To serve the will of Malice, and of hate; Or, with what ease, Oppressours, thereby may, (And sometimes do) not only ruinate An honest Fame, but also take away, As well their pretious lives, as an estate From Innocents; Death, would not seem a Law Too strict, to keep those Wicked ones, in awe. The Land, through Oathes and Curses, also, mournes: For, some have learn'd new oathes, and imprecations, Not heard of heretofore; and, GOD returnes On their owne heads, their wished-for Damnations. In Cursings they delighted; and they soke Like Oyle into their bones. They took a pride In wishing Plagues; and, lo, as with a cloke Therewith, now, wrapt they are on ev'rie side. You lov'd not Blessings: but, when you enjoy'd Peace, plentie, health, and safetie, you despis'd Those Mercies; and behold, they are destroy'd, That they, hereafter, may be better priz'd. You, long have partners been in ev'rie sin, And, now, each others Hang-men, you have bin. When ev'rie neighb'ring house is in a flame, You store your owne, as if no danger were. In Honestie's, and in Religion's name, You credit get; and publike Robbers are. To lye, and to be perjur'd for the Cause Of GOD, your King, or Countrey, is a gin To catch Opinion; whereby, most, he drawes, That is most bold, and impudent therein. By some pretence, to benefit the State, Religion to promote, or aid the King, You colour your oppressions; slander, cheat, And, put in practice almost any thing: You, by a shew, the Gen'rall to preserve, Particulars, unmercifully starve. You wrong the meaning of your Parliament When their estates you seize who are their Foes; To their undoing, who are innocent, And blamelesse, though the Creditors, of those. And, were it our Designment to accuse Particulars (as to informe and warne, In gen'rall termes; that, they, who yet abuse Their power, more humanitie might learn) We could have instanced in many things, Discov'ring, that, their number is not few, Whose Crueltie, Reproach, and Curses, brings On those Proceedings, which they did pursue With Prudence, and with Mercie, should relieve The Publike, more; and, private men, lesse grieve. One part of you, contributes to the King; The other Partie, to the Parliament: To these, you personall assistance bring; To these, you liberally your goods have lent: Yet, most of you, who thus ingaged are, Are both to King, and Parliament untrue: For, many signes your faithlesnesse declare, And many things your giddinesse doth shew. You are most firme to that, which you conceive Your private weal, or safety, best promotes: While that is doubtfull, you, Demurs can weave; When that is plaine, you quickly turne your Coats; And, to that end, you craftily provide Quaint shifts, to serve your turnes, on either side. Some, by Intelligence, themselves indear; Or, by some service acted under-hand. By secret Favours, Friends you can prepare, Who in the Gap, for you, at need shall stand. Some, have a Son, a Father or a Brother, Who Ledger with your Adverse-party, lies; To make good Terms of Peace, for one another, According as Occasions may arise. And (to advance this Project) they, who spend Their Blood, and Fortunes, with a single heart, (Indeavouring truly for the noblest end) Engaged are, to act a desp'rate part; Which, into present mischiefs, them doth cast, And, into feares of greater, at the last. You, have not Faith enough, in GOD, to trust; (Though, wonder-working Faith, you do pretend) And, that, hath tempted you to things unjust: That, makes you on your arme of flesh depend. That, makes you bold, when you should rather feare; And, fearfull grow, when you should bolder be: That, makes your Foe so vigilant appeare; And, you, so many things, to over-see. That, makes you, for your Ayd, poor tricks devise, And take that Course which Scandall on you draws: That, makes you think, that false Reports, and Lies, Are meritorious in an Honest-Cause: And, by these failings, you your peace delay; And justifie your foes, in their lewd way. They, who abhorre Pluralities in other, And in your Clergie hate non-residence; Can, Office unto Office joyn together, And, in themselves, suppose it no offence. Some, can heap up Command, upon Command, Share, or take all the honour, and the pay, (When but for cyphers, nay for lesse they stand) And other mens true value take away. Some, when the Publike was in great distresse, (Though they Commanded few, had pay for many) Yea, some of you (who better minds professe) Were paid for souldiers, when you had not any: And, some have took, (who yet for payment call) In Plunder and Free-quarter, more then all. Of Orphans cries, and of the Widdowes tears, Whose Fathers and whose Husbands for your sake, Have spent their lives, and fortunes in these wars. More heed, more care, more pitie, you must take. When at your doores, and at your feet they lie, To crave a part of that which is their own, To feed them in their great necessity, More Bowells of Compassion, must be showne. And, they who, to contribute, have not spar'd Paines, Councells, Prayers, Persons, nor Estates In publike duties, must finde more regard, Before the furie of this Plague abates: For, who can hope the GOD of Righteousnesse, Will shew forth mercie, to the mercilesse? They, who in Peace, the blood of War have shed As Ioab did; or, have expos'd their friends, And faithfull souldiers, to be murthered To hide their Plots, or to effect their Ends, Must not be winked at: nor they, who dare So partiall in their judgements to become, As to inflict on those that equalls are In their transgressions, an unequall-doome: For, of this partiall dealing there is found, A murmur in your streets: and, Common-fame Reports, injustice so much to abound; That, he speedes best, who merits greatest blame: And, that, for sin, when Accessaries bleed, The Principalls find favour, and are freed. Your Beasts of prey, who live upon the spoile, And, by the publike ruines, fat are growne, Must either quite be chased from this Isle, Or, from their dens, be rouz'd, and hunted down. Your Ambodexters, who are neither true, To GOD, nor Man, to King, nor Parliament, Must learn a better temp'rature to shew, And of their fraud, and ficklenesse repent. Those Rotten-Members, those false Officers, And those Committee-men, who have deceiv'd The Kingdomes Trust, must for that guilt of theirs, Passe other doomes, then yet they have receiv'd, Before those wrongs, and practices, do cease, Which keep away your much desired Peace. They who have almost perfected the times For desolation, by habituating Themselves in Sodom's, and Gomorrah's crimes; And, by an impudently imitating Of their impenitence: ev'n they, that had The pride of life, sacietie of bread, And liv'd in idlenesse; must, now, be made To tast their suffrings, who are hunger-fed: To feele the paines of their laborious life, Who, sweat in good employments; and the scorne, Which humble-men have long without reliefe, By their oppression, and ambition, borne. These must be humbled, and perhaps destroy'd, Before your expectations are enjoy'd. Your counterfeit and rash Reformers, too, Must change their hearts, and regulate their zeale, Ere you shall compasse what you hope to do, In matters of the Church, or Common-weale. Your Scribes and Pharisees, who by long prayer, Devour poore Widdowes houses; and by shewes Of honestie (and by pretending faire To pietie) good meaning soules abuse: They, who in tithing mint, and annise, are More strict, then in the weightie points of Law; And, burthens great, for other men prepare, When they themselves will hardly lift a straw: These, must, e're perfect Peace you here shall see, Be more unvizarded, then yet they be. Your pettie-Tyrants, must be likewise fewer, Then now they are; e're GOD will condescend, To ease your burthens, or your griefes to cure; Or, bring your dis-agreements to an end. For, how, in equitie, can you expect Your GOD should free you, from those injuries, That Sov'raignty-abused may inflict? Whilst you, on one another, tyrannize? Or, how can, possibly, true Peace be there, Where well nigh all are Tyrants to their power? And, as they get advantage domineer, Insult, oppresse, impov'rish, and devoure? For, this oppression you may plainly see In some of everie Calling, and Degree. Nigh ev'rie one the King exemplifies, In usurpation of Prorogatives, Above his due: Nay, that which he denies Vnto his Prince; injuriously, he strives To take unto himselfe. The Peer, upon The Commoner usurps: The Husband, so Vpon the Wife: The Father, on the Son; And, on their Servants, thus, the Masters, do. In everie Corporation, thus presume The Governours; yea, thus the Magistrate Of lowest ranke, doth on himselfe assume What, in his Chiefe, he will not tolerate: And, they who their own Freedoms, fain would save, Are alwaies willing, others to inslave. These, and such Scabs, and Tetters, must be sear'd E're they will heal; And, you must cut away Those Members, whereon Gangrieves have appear'd: Which, els, this Kingdoms body will destroy. For, multitudes of those, among you, hide Their Addle-heads: yea, many such as these (Corrupting, both the one, and other side) Do keep incurable this Lands disease. And, to your safetie, it would most redound, (And your desired Peace, the more assure) If, by each partie, their own faults were found; And, they themselves, endeavour'd their own cure: Which, shall perhaps, begin, when on one day, Both Parties, for this Grace, shall Fast, and Pray. But, why shouldst thou be kept attending, here, What further (to this purpose) may be said, And be the while (when thou no harm dost fear) Injuriously rewarded, and betraid? Lo; they that hate thee, while thou art imploid To seek their Peace; have now prevailed so, That, if their plot thou quickly make not void, They, whom thou honour'st most, shall thee undo. That mischief to prevent, make therefore speed; And, mark, when thy endeavour thou hast done, What justice or injustice shall succeed: For, guesse thou mayest, by what befalls thereon, How safely thou hast ventur'd thy estate Vpon the publike-Faith, or publique-Fate. The VOICE here paws'd againe; and, forth I went To see, how I requited was by them, In whose defence, my fortunes, I have spent; My life adventur'd, and consum'd my time. If they deceive my hope, my greatest grief Will be for them; because, I plainly see Their failing me, of promised relief, Will more dishonour them, then hinder me. For, nor on Peeres nor Commons, I depend: But, on his pow'r, and on his love alone, Who, ere I had my being, was my Friend; And, shall be, when my Foes are all undone. By Him, in all oppressions, I am eas'd; With whatsoere he pleases, I am pleas'd. The third Canto. Excuse me, if your longings be delai'd, Mine owne Affaires, a little, to review; And, if, here somewhat of my selfe be said, Before my former Subject I pursue. For, though I know not many, much encli'nd, To heare, or speak, of what may profit me, And see most pleas'd, when I am as unkind, Or failing to my selfe, as others be: Yea, though sometime I have appeared such, Yet, now, my meaning to my selfe is better; And, therefore, whosoever thinks it much, My selfe, I finding, to my selfe a Debter, Will here presume (because I justly may) To do my selfe an Errand, by the way. I know it will not relish well with some, When, of my selfe, they this Digression find; But (seeing Charitie begins at home) When others do not, I, my selfe will mind. My wrongs do not alone extend to me; But, on the Publike Rights take, likewise, hold: And, for my sake, since heard they cannot be, They, for the Common-Safetie, shall be told. Most famous Prophets, and renowned Saints, And many other of approved wit, When they oppressed were did make complaints, And in their Volumes of themselves have writ. If therefore, any of my Readers grutch, The time of reading, some few leaves, to spare, Concerning me, who have not thought it much, All this, for his Advantage, to prepare; I leave him to his pleasure, and his ease, And bold will make, to do as I shall please. The VOICE dismissing me, as in the Close Of my preceding Canto, you have heard, From Postures of Retirement, I arose, To see, in what Designes, my Foes appear'd. And, saw indeed my selfe so ill befriended, That (whilst I mused with a serious thought, What to the Common Peace and Safetie tended) My Ruine had maliciously been sought. And, that it hath been follow'd, ever since My first engagement in these fatall wars; By reason of an evill Influence, To me directed from malignant Stars, Who shining, openly, with faire Aspects, Produce, in secret, mischievous Effects. Which, if I should endeavour to expresse, The paines, a small Advantage would returne; Since, they who might my Grievances redresse, Might grudge to heare so much as I have borne. For, by Oppressions, manifold and great, Remonstrances are often made so long, That, when Redresses we suppose to get, Our just Complaints, unheard, away are flung: And, Malice can with so much impudence Invent, and vent untruths, (in hope thereby To disadvantage truest Innocence) That, Patience is our cheapest remedy: And, he who seeks for other Cures, oft doubles His Grievance by Expence, Affronts, or Troubles. There are so many Passages awry, In ev'rie Action; and, in ev'rie Cause, So many Tricks, to put a Hearing by; To blind the Judges, and pervert the Lawes: So many Fees and Charges, to be paid To Witnesses, to Clerks, and Counsellours, Which quite are lost, when Hearings are delai'd; (Ten times, perchance, before an end appears:) Nay, often, Partialitie and Pride, (In stead of Justice) gives that provocation, Which no free Spirit, alwaies, can abide, Without some shewes of outward Indignation; Whereby, he peradventure, doth augment That mischiefe, which he labours to prevent. At first, I hoped better, and I strove In humble Supplications, to declare My suffrings; and, their burden to remove. Where likel'est means of such atchievement were. But, there I saw such throngings with Petitions; So small assistance, and so much ado: There, saw I, in all private Expeditions, And, in the publike, such Obstructions too: Such waiting, such solliciting by friends; Such mis-informings, makings, and unmakings; Such partialitie, for private ends, Such thwartings, such Opposings, and mistakings: And, had so difficult a Course to run, That, e're I could be heard I was undone. A place of Profit, or of Reputation, I never, hitherto, from any sought, Vntill my selfe thereto by invitation (From those whom it concern'd) I called thought. And, when I have a matter to be heard, I can enforce my selfe to little more, Than (after I my suit have once preferr'd) To wait for hearing, at the Counsell doore. Perhaps, when long unheeded I attend, I give remembrances that I am there; Or, for dispatch, a word or two can spend: And, if I speed not, much I do not care. By which blunt course, I past, with little fruit, Through many an honest Cause, and hopefull Suit. When long Attendance, no dispatch affords, My Passions, peradventure, overflow; And, boyle up into those impatient words, Which more Corruption, than Discretion, show. And, then, they who, before, to do me right, Could find no leisure, straight at leisure be, To heare enough to do me a despight; And, to my temper, that reduceth me. For, though they, with a mischief, send me home; Yet, many good effects, thereout arise: Of them, and of my self, I, there, become A Censurer: and, studie to despise Those Things, and those Affaires pertaining to me, Wherein, a Foole or Villaine, may undo me. I cannot, though my life it were to save, Sollicite, as I see most Suiters can; And, rather than repulses I would have, Vse ev'rie means, almost, to ev'rie man. When I bring in a matter to be tri'd, I hope, that all my Judges will be just: And, (though, this way, much failing I have spide,) Till he deceives me, no man I distrust. To presse meer strangers, I, too modest am; Wise men, regard not much solicitation; To urge my Friends, their friendship seemes to blame; To Court a Foole, is my abhomination: And, favours to implore from persons evill, To me appeares, a praying to the Devill. This Inclination, as it keeps me poore, So, it preserves me out of many Snares: It makes my inward quiet much the more, When outwardly, my rest disturb'd appeares. And, therefore, when away I have been sent, With lesse then nought, when more then all was due, One puffe blew off, my greatest discontent; And, e're I slept, I pleas'd, and merrie grew. But, I of late, before I was aware, That Object of my Contemplation lost, Which teaches how affliction I should beare: And, being with a sudden storm, then tost, Opprest with wants, and with unkindnesse too, It made me vex my selfe, as others do. And, much adoe I had to keep my tongue From speaking out the murm'rings of my heart; And wonder not, that, others, having wrong, Do somtime act an unbeseeming part: No marvell, though a wiser man then I, Was causlesly a mad-man term'd of late, By reason he had with impatiencie, Oppos'd some grosse abusings of the State: And, that, the wisdome of the Holy Ghost, Hath said, Oppression makes a wise man mad: For, though true wisdome never can be lost, A fit of madnesse may be thereby had; And, so I think had I: and, so may you, Who read me, being us'd as I am now. For, when I came abroad and saw the spight Which had been done me: And, when done it was How much contentment, and how much delight The Doers took in what they brought to passe; Although I sleighted them, as foolish men, Who had no sense, how I aveng'd might be, Nor worth, to move my anger, or my pen) Vnkindnesses, in others, troubled me. And, though my service merit not so much As an Acknowledgement (much lesse reward) I thought, my love unto my Countrey such, As might, at least, have purchased regard, And friends enough, for me to have injoy'd More grace then he, that would have her destroy'd. Which finding otherwise; as one amaz'd, I sate a while; not well discerning whether Griefe, Shame, or Anger, that demurrer caus'd (Or all those passions mustred up together.) But, when I call'd to minde how many years The Brunts of opposition, and of scorne, Indur'd I have, for what, to me, appeares To be the chiefest work, for which I'm borne: And, when I minded, that, nor Peace, nor War, Prelaticall, nor Presbyterian daies, Nor youth, nor age, to me propitious are; That King nor People, favour'd my essayes: And, that nor Friends, nor Foes, nor Wrong, nor Right Befriended me; it broke my patience quite. And being much distemper'd, thus my thoughts Began to grumble, (having drawne together A crew, of Riotous distrusts and doubts, Which, in such cases, call forth one another) Art thou (said they to me) for all thy paines, Thy losses, and adventures, thus rewarded? Is this, the well-affected Parties gaines? Are thus, our Vowes and Covenants rewarded? Have we the tricks of Hocus Pocus learned At our Committees? And, can some convay A mischievous Designe, so undiscerned, That, Honestie nor Wit, discover may How impudently they abuse the State, For private profit, or through private hate? Was I, the first of those, who, where I dwelt, To guard our Liberties, and save our Lawes, An uncompelled Contribution dealt? And, who first there was armed for this Cause? Was I, among the first, who did withstand The secret plottings of Malignants, there? And, Horse, and Foot, and Castle did command, When fewer Friends, than Foes, about me were? Was I, among the first, of whose estate The furious Adversarie made a prey? Did I expose my selfe unto their hate, Who offred me, a fairer-seeming way; Wherein appear'd, what chance soever came, A likely means, to get a saving-game? Have I, my life adventur'd often too, Through much discouragement, and without pay? Done everie thing my strength or wit could do, To keep the Weak, from falling quite away? To help confirme the Strong? To bring them home, Who by Seducers have been led aside? To make our Newters, Zelots to become? And mark-out Foes, that, here, as friends abide? Have I, with patience view'd my selfe bereft, In Taxes and Free-quarterings, by our owne, Of what to me, the plundring Foe had left? And, suffred other Injuries unknowne In publike? and (it may be) now conceal'd, That, they more seasonably may be reveal'd? Have I, upon the Publike-Faith reli'd, And on the Commons Order, fairly granted, Vntill my Children might for bread have cri'd, If I my self, had private credit wanted? Have I, to serve my Countrey, so engaged My Fortunes and my selfe, that, Open Foes Against me are implacably inraged, And, Secret-Ones, as virulent as those? Have I, adventured, likewise, therewithall Hopes present, and in expectation too, Resolving, with this Cause, to stand and fall, And (though abus'd) my Dutie still to do? Yea, thus have I resolv'd? thus done? thus borne? To be repaid with injuries and scorne? Behold, Malignancie is growne so strong Within our Quarters; and, hath so made voyd The Publike Faith, that, I am lately flung Quite out of that, which I, thereby, enjoy'd: And, it hath acted with such insolence, By colour of Authoritie abus'd, That, it proceeds to warlike violence; And like a Foe, the Kingdoms-friend, hath us'd. Before I knew, that, any man appear'd Against me there, where I was overthrowne; Before that I was called to be heard, Before my claime or answer, could be knowne; I was expell'd unjustly, from my right, With all the circumstances, of despight. For, He that hath been armed to bereave me, Of what by publike Order I possest, And, wherewith (if good hopes do not deceive me) That, Order shall, ere long, me re-invest; Seem'd not enough content that he so sped, Vnlesse by boasting of his Conquests too, The Well-affected he discouraged; And, shew'd Malignants, what his Friends could do: Nor was it without much discouragement, To all the Faithfull-Partie thereabout; For, when they saw my hopes had that event, It made them partly feare, and partly doubt; Lest he, who for the Publike most hath done, May live, till he shall least be thought upon. For, nothing was considerable shew'd, In him, to whom I did perforce resigne; But, that his hands were in their bloud imbrew'd, For whose defence, I have adventur'd mine. I, put on Armes, to serve the Common-weale; And, for her safetie offred all I had: He, raised Forces, but to rob and steale; And, to his pow'r, a spoyle thereof he made. Nor, came he hither, as hath been surmiz'd, With such Repentance, as he ought to bring; But, to pursue a Stratagem, devis'd, To have betray'd my person to the King: Which not succeeding, and, he finding friends Among my Foes, pursued other ends. For, Friends he found (as most Malignants do) So forward our Ill-willers to protect, So pow'rfull, and, withall, so cunning too, Their ends, by faire pretences, to effect; That, though I were their neighbour, and their friend; Though my endeavours had been truly done, To further that, whereto they love pretend; And, though before this War, I knew not one, Whose malice, in those parts, suspect I mought; Nor any person, who suspected me To them injurious, in word, deed, or thought: Yea, though, by Covenant, oblig'd they be On my behalfe; They, naythelesse, did grow Confed'rates with this Stranger, my knowne Foe. Else, when they heard how first the Plot was layd For my surprisall; where, it was begun; To whom, he meant I should have been betrayd; By whom, and how, and when it should be done, Averr'd on oath, me thinks, in such a case He should not, then, so suddenly, have found So many fav'ring him, to my disgrace, If all of them had at the heart been sound. Nor, would you think, if everie circumstance Were fully told, that Charitie first drew So many to afford him countenance, Who was their Foe, if they to us were true; And, who may thank the spite they bore to me, That, they, to him, so kind and friendly be. And, on some likely Grounds, conceive I may Those friends of his were they, who first convay'd Those notions to him, which first shew'd the way, How to my Foes I should have been betray'd. For, from our Quarters, he so far, then, liv'd, That, else, our Posture, and Affections, here, He had not so well knowne, to have contriv'd A plot, which did so feizable appeare. And, when he came (as if his coming thither, A blessing to the Conntrey had been thought) To further his Designes, they joyn'd together; They strength'ned him, against me, what they mought: And published of me, to my disgrace, What neither done, nor spoke, nor purpos'd was. And, that they with their Grandees might comply, My Neighbours turn'd about, I also find; They whom, in Peace, I alwaies lived by, And, unto whom I never was unkind; Ev'n they, who true respect from me have had, And, till this War, the like to me did show, Are of my losses and disgraces glad, And, to my causlesse wrong, befriend my Foe. They mention me, when they together sit, As if it hardly could allowed be, That, of Religion, Souldierie, or Wit, There appertained any share to me; And speak for truths, what they themselves do know They may with safety sweare, is nothing so. My greatest wrongs, and suffrings, now, be there Where best I have deserv'd: My greatest scorne And dis-respect, is in those places, where My dwelling was; and there where I was borne. They who are most obliged to befriend me, Have most abus'd my patience, and desert; They, who have made a Covenant to defend me, Have with my chiefest haters taken part. Yea, now, when my affronts are to the wrong Of Publike-Justice; and, when my defence Vnto the Publike-safety doth belong, They have expos'd my well-known innocence, To his despight, 'gainst whom, erewhile, I thought I needed not, protections to have sought. In some respects, their cruelties are more Then theirs, by whom my dwelling wast was laid; For, (though they rob'd my house, and left me poore) To bar reliefe, no spightfull part they plaid. But, these trod on me, when they saw me down; And, lest I should finde pitie in distresse, A false report by them abroad was blowne, As if my well-knowne losses had been lesse Then I can prove them; For, I offer here That if my hindrances (well weigh'd) be found One mite below what I affirm'd they were; For ev'rie shilling I will give a pound, If they will my true dammages defray When I have prov'd that true which they gain-say. Yet, some, to that intent, did late suborne The most defamed Varlets of the Shire To sweare against me, and to be forsworne, By crossing what they formerly did swear: To that intent, while our Committee sate, The Kingdomes Foe, had leave in person, there, To mannage witnesses, as for the State, And, them by leading questions to prepare, For proofe of what they falsly did suggest, To my dishonour: But, they could not bring Their witnesses, against me, to attest, One culpable, or one materiall thing; Nor was it worth regarding if they had, Consid'ring, of what persons, choice they made. For, one of those, unto that village came Where now he lives; due punishment to shun, Or, to escape a just deserving shame, For what he in another place had done. He, now, in part by labour, part by prowling, (With other courses to his neighbours knowne, As lawlesse fishings, and unlawfull fowling) And taking somwhat more then is his own, Makes shift to live. Another of this Pack, Was he, that should have been the Instrument Of my betraying, who like course doth take; And, lately, to avoid the punishiment Deserved long, is married to a whore; With whom he lived like a knave before. The third, a Labourer of evill fame, Whom I five years together had imploy'd (To keep his brats from starving, him from shame, And, that, he other mischieves might avoid) This Beast, when I was plundred by our Foes Of what they found, made offer (for a sum, By him desired) that he would disclose A parcell of my goods, then hidden from Those Vultures eyes; who, readily agreed To promise much: But, when the work was done, And, this false Traitor came to aske his meed, Some blowes they gave, but, money gave him none; And, told him, hanging was the fittest pay For him, that such a master would betray. The fourth of these, had been my servant too, Whom (though he had deserved publike shame For doing more then honestie should do) I put away, without an open blame: And, at that time his faultinesse conceal'd, Because he seem'd religiously inclin'd; But, shortly after, other men beheld Apparent proofe of his dis-honest mind. For, in the night felloniously he broke A Colonels Field-Waggon of our side Then quartering at his Masters; and thence took Some things of worth; for which, he did abide Correction in the Bilboes, for a day, And after, by connivance, ran away. These were the witnesses, which forth were sought By some who for the Parliament pretend, In hope their power, should more effects have wrought On those choice Instruments to worke their end. These (whom I'le prove charactred thus to be Without the least addition of a lie) Are they, whom now my foes, to scandall me, Have rak'd out of the ditch of infamy. These, are encourag'd to devise and say Of me their pleasures: and to bring and carrie What ever to my wrong convert they may, Or to the profit of my adversarie; Whom, to the States dishonour, they protect, And meerly, in dispight of me, respect. When informations, were against him laid, And his reply required thereunto; From just restraint, his person they convaid, Before cause showne, or order so to do. On his behalfe they have subscribed hands, Thereby deluding, wilfully, the State: He had our soulderie at his commands, To execute his pleasure, and their hate. And, hath so far prevailed, that unlesse The mercie of the State vouchsafe with speed The suffrings of her servant to redresse, And him, and his oppressors better heed; For ought he sees, his Countrey he may serve With faithfulnesse; and yet his houshold starve. Why should my person from that place be driven, In which I best know how to serve the State? Of what to me, by publike grace was given, Why should I be depriv'd, by private hate? What knew they in him, whom they more befriended, But that he was this Realmes professed foe? Or why to do me wrong have they contended, Except because I never will be so? They who were wont to gloze and fawne upon me, When I was arm'd among them; and while they To their Designes were hopefull to have won me, Now snuffe, and turn their nose another way. And think, that they themselves now quite have freed, From him, who mark'd and hindred their proceed. For, that Confed'racie within those parts, Where then I liv'd (and maugre whose intent I there commanded) having rotten hearts Vnfaithfull, alwaies to the Parliament, Perceiving me unlikelie to be made Their Instrument; and, that my presence, there, (With such repute, and power as I then had) Might marre their works, which they contriving were: They so prevail'd, that from my Garrison I was removed, if thence not betray'd: (For many things suceeded thereupon, Which made me think, that so it may be said) And all our neigh'bring Countrie, ever since, Hath dearly paid, for my removing thence. When I was gone, a part of those arose (Encourag'd by some other underhand) And my estate, (as chiefest of their foes) First seiz'd; and then, the place of my Command. In which forth-breaking, some went on so far, That, ever since, they open foes have been: Some went as far as fooles, and cowards dare; And then slunck back, in hope they were not seen. But, some of them so cunningly did act, That, though they are as guilty as the rest, By circumstances; yet, by open fact Their falshood is not perfectly exprest: And, these by cunning, such effects have wrought, That knaves and fooles, our faithfull men are thought. These, have a way invented how to arme The dangeroust Malignants of the Shire, And, make men hope their Foes will do no harme, Till sheathed in their Chest their swords appeare. These, have a trick to make their neighbours dreame, A double Taxe increaseth not their cost, And, that though their designes have begger'd them, Their wit, alone, sav'd all from being lost. These, have so laid their Scœne, and acted so, That, though we daily heare, and plainly see, What course they bend, and what they mean to do, (When all things to their purpose rip'ned be) We strive in vain their projects to prevent; And, gaine but mischieves, for our good intent. Nay, this new Junto, doth so strong become, By their conferring Offices and Places, By adding-to, and by removing-from, By secret-commendations, and disgraces; And by deluding of a simple crew, (Who, by these Polititians, may be brought Their own perdition fiercely to pursue) That, they have almost compast what they sought; And, they will gain the rest, if not prevented; For, by their diligence, they have removed, Vndone, discouraged, or discontendted Most men, whose faithfulnesse was most approved: And, they, whose power, these cannot yet destroy, Do act with small successe, and little joy. Had I conceiv'd, that, now it would have been, As needfull as I find it, to collect Such proofes of that which I have heard and seen To prove their faithlesnesse whom I suspect, Or know unfaithfull: that, I might have made Such proofes to others, as I have whereby To prove it to my selfe; I should have had Enough to make me able to unty That knot of Vipers, which now to unknit Is not so easie. But, my aime hath bin To mend particulars, and bend my wit, In generalls, alone, to strike at sin: And, that hath rendred, now, my power the lesse, The mischiefs of this Faction to suppresse. These, having long, and many severall wayes, To root me from among them, tride their wit; And failed heretofore in their assayes, At last, thus hapned to accomplish it. Within that Village, where my Spoilers made A prey of that estate which I possest, A Captain of the Kings a Chattle had, With which, the Parliament did me invest. He, is that person who protected was, As I have here exprest: had they a thought, By countenancing him, to bring to passe Their purpose; and have gained what they sought, For, I, who serv'd my Countrie, thence am chas'd; And he that spoild it, in my room, is plac'd. I grudge not mercie when it should be showne, Nor is my heart so churlishly inclin'd, As not to spare, a portion of mine owne, Where, Objects fit for mercy, I shall find, But, when I see my selfe ungently us'd, Those favour'd, who my life would have betray'd, Authoritie deluded and abus'd, And plots to ruine, and disgrace me, laid; I cannot think it Patience to be mute, In such a case; or, that with charitie, Or with a manly prudence it can suit, To passe, at all times, such abuses by: Or, that we may not, justly, on our foes Repaire what in this lawfull war we lose. Why should it grudged be, that by the Sword, We, by the Sword, our losses repossesse? Why should our Partie to their friends afford Lesse favour, then to those that merit lesse? So well deserving, wherefore should he seem Who put the State to hazzard, and to cost That all his great estate he should redeem For lesse, then at one skirmish I have lost? Of those reliefes, why should I be defeated, Which do, by right and grace, to me belong? Thereof, why should I be dispoil'd and cheated, Both to the States dishonour, and my wrong? And, wherfore should I not expect, and have A confirmation, of what once they gave? For, who will in our Senators confide, Or prize their Orders which are made by them, If they permit them to be vilifi'd? And, their Ioynt-Votes, loose Members to contemne? To say, they heeded not what things they granted, So prudent an Assembly, mis-became; To say, they power to make it good, have wanted, Would wrong their power, and bring us all to shame: And, to affirme that they regardlesse are To vindicate their grant, for his relief, Who to advantage them, his life could spare, Were to averre, what merits no belief. How comes it then, that, I dispights have born? And that their favours, now from me, are torn? Why hath it openlie, by some, been spoke Ere question put, or anie vote made known, That, there is an intention to revoke What by the Commons, was on me bestown? How dared he (who rather should uphold The Commons lawfull Right in what he may) How dared he (assoon as it was told By whom I claim'd) in sleighting wise to say, Twas but the Commons Order? as if that Were not an Act sufficient to confer, For my Recruit, the personall estate Of any trait'rous Rebell-Commoner; Vntill a time return, in which, men may Have Justice done them, in a legall way. Why are false rumours rais'd and entertain'd, As if I manie thousand pounds had got; Whereas, of hind'rances by me sustain'd, To me, the tenth as yet returneth not? How comes it, that attendance, nigh two yeare Procureth me (although my wants be great) No pennie of two thousand pounds arreare? Nor an imploiment, that affords me meat? Why speed I thus? And wherefore, notwithstanding The remnant of my ruines forth I laid, Thereby to keep my souldiers from disbanding, Is nothing, in requitall, yet, repaid, But sleights, and slanders? yea, though use I pay For manie hundreds of it, to this day? Indeed, my house GOD hath refurnished; And, of his Love, to give me outward showes, Hath cloath'd my Bodie, and my Table spred, As well in spite, as presence of my Foes. Yet, when I shall account how I have liv'd; Of what I have been hindred, since this war; How, much was lost; how little is receiv'd; How, my successive-wants supplied are: How, my engagements ev'rie day encrease, How destitute, my Wife and Children be, Of outward Portions; and, how mercilesse This world, hath all my life time, been to me: They, who their favours, have on me bestow'd, Shall find no cause to grudge the Mercie show'd. And though (as some conceive) I had obtained A full repaire, and therewith somewhat more Than my bare losses? what, had I then gained, Respecting all my damage heretofore? Against those Traytours to the Common-Good, Who, now, apparent Enemies are found, Nigh thirtie yeares, a Combate I have stood: So long ago, I to these Iles did sound A warning Trumpet. So long have I borne The frownes and furie of the wanton Court, The Prelates malice, the despitefull scorne Of wealthy Fooles, and of the vulgar sort. Yea, though I know a path applauded more, I took the course, I knew, would keep me poore. And, why should any man be discontent, That for my damages, and service then, My charges, paines, and close imprisonment, I, now have bread, and clothes, like other men? Why is a trifle thought too much for me? When, one sleight Officer can in a yeare, Cheat up a Sum, that shall sufficient be, To pay my damages, and my Arreare? Why, grievous doth it seeme, that, out of that, Which was by him possessed, who compli'd With those, who robbed me of my estate, A part of my great losse should be suppli'd? He having spoyl'd my Friends of ten times more, Than, ten times that small part, he should restore. Since, we for Traytours, and for Cut-throats, here, (And for their wives, and their malignant brood) Provisions make, when Converts they appeare; Why should there not, of raiment, and of food, For us, our Wives, and Children, some supplies Be likewise made? yea, since they were the Cause, That, on our backs, the work so heavie lies, Of holding up our Liberties, and Lawes? Why are we poorly cloth'd, while they are brave, By whose unfaithfulnesse we are undone? While we want bread, why should they fulnesse have, By whom, these wars and troubles were begun? And, till a Restauration may be had, Of what we lost, why should they rich be made? Since by our Adverse partie, our estate Is given and possessed: Since we are Assured of their everlasting hate, So long as we have either peace, or war, Or Being in this life: yea, since our Cause Is knowne unto us, to be just, and right; Since for our Conscience, Liberties, and Lawes, Against oppressing Tyrants we do fight: Since to avenge the Saints, we do oppose, Not meerly Cananites, whom for their sin, The Land would vomit forth; but, also those, Who without cause, this war did first begin: Why should we not out of their Barnes be fed, By whom we have been robbed of our bread? Nay, since our Charitie doth portions give, To feed their wives and children, while among Our Adversaries, in that course, they live, Which this unhappie Warfare doth prolong, Why should not we and ours, as well as they, Be cared for? since with a willing heart, We bore the heat and burthen of the day, And, from our duties, mean not to depart? Why is our equitie, and our discretion So small, that till our losses be repai'd, We suffer for a trifling composition, Their whole estates, by them to be enjoy'd? And, their full freedome, who, for ought we know, Are here, but Spies, or Agents for the Foe? He, whom, that true Repentance bringeth home, Which makes a reall Convert to the State, Not for his Lands, but Conscience sake doth come; And, such an one, if we redintegrate, When, of his penitence good proofes appeare; Of Charitie, both to our selves and them, An honourable Evidence it were, Which no man should repine at, or condemne. But, when we unadvisedly shall part With large Possessions, for a Person, which Brings to us, neither wit, nor honest heart, Nor Pow'r, nor any thing to make us rich, But poorer; and, it may be weaker too, How reasonlesse, is then the thing we do? When we receive to Mercie, those who seek No more, but how they their estates may save; To compasse by that match, what are we like, But an estate to lose, and find a knave? They, strength receiving, from our false-ones, here, Restrengthen them; and are so knit together, That, we who to this Cause most faithfull were, Are much disabled by their coming hither. And, what advantage had we lost, I pray, If of those few, who reconciled seeme, None had return'd? what lost we, if you weigh, How uselesse to that partie they did seeme, From whom they came (while they continued there?) And, what they are to us now they are here? Who shall at last our private losse repay, If this course hold? who shall the charge sustaine Of all our future detriments, but they, Who of the cost already do complaine? Why should a perjur'd Commoner, or Lord, (Who, peradventure, did but stay behind, That some advantages it might afford, To those departed) suffred be to blind The Publike Eye, in favour of our Foes? Defraud the State? And in our competitions Sleight, and affront us, for the sake of those, Who wilfully endeavour'd our perditions? And, only, come (for ought yet knowne unto us) That, at our cost, they safely may undo us? When of my goods, the Foe had me dispoil'd, (For doing faithfull service) and when I, To seek an habitation was compell'd, And had provided for my Family, By publike Order; why neglected so Was I, and mine? That (knowing not else where My wife with her big belly to bestow) I was displac'd, and forc'd to habour there, Where desolation dwelt? And, in that place, Why was the wife of him that plund'red me There setled? why, to my disgrace, Must I the second time removed be, And made a Shuttle-cock, or Tennis-ball, For ev'rie Foole and Knave to play withall? As I have hope to live, and see an end Of these Distractions; and, as ere I die, I hope to see our greatest Foe our Friend, (Which are my Hopes, though yet I know not why) Vnlesse the Civill Justice shall ere long, Restore my Right; If all the braines I have, Can in a martiall Posture make me strong, My Tamenesse, shall no longer me inslave. But, what the Commons pleased to afford (My losses in their Service, to repay) Ile repossesse, and settle by the Sword, Or, in that place, my bones I meane to lay. No run-away Commander of the Kings, Shall baffle me, although unto his aid, A Troop of those Committee-men he brings, By whom the best affected are betrai'd; But, I will make it knowne, if urg'd thereto, I dare do that, none think I dare to do. My heart thus murmur'd: And, I know not well, To what it would have stirr'd me; for, my blood Began to boile, my veines began to swell, And, in mine eyes, a flaming furie stood. But, ere this great distemper, to it height Was raised up; I felt into my brest Another Spirit entring, which made sleight Of all, which in this rapture was exprest. With many secret checks my heart it strooke, (Which no man but my selfe do much concerne) Out of my soule repining thoughts it shooke, It taught me my great failings to discerne; And, then, the VOICE late heard, did thus begin, To speak againe unto me, from within. Impatient, foolish, and forgetfull man, If, now, thou hadst been left to thy career, To what conclusions had thy folly ran? And, what wouldst thou have made thy selfe appear? These are, indeed, such musings as the times Are busied in. This, is the common note; Thus go the Citie, and the Countrey chimes; And, this, without book, now, most men have got. Your private wrongs, and injuries are minded, With such a partiall, and self-seeking heart; That, in all publike matters, most are blinded, And, act a carelesse, or a faithlesse part. Yea, so much after private ends men run, That little publike service can be done. In such a blustring tone, thou here hadst shew'd Thy private wrongs, as if thy passion meant, By furie, some short passage to have hew'd, Through all Opposers, to thine owne content. This will not be the Way, to break asunder The Lincks of Tyrannie. Among you, be So many stormes of lightning, and of thunder, Already raised, that no Coast is free. The calmest tempers, and the sobrest wit, The self-denying, and the suffring hearts; The Worke, the Time, the Place, now best befit: And, if by these, you play not forth your parts, The Tragedies, now acting on your stage, Prolong'd will be, with an encreasing rage. In ev'rie Publike Work (as here thou dost) Each one, some way or other, still contrives How, thereinto he that Designe may thrust, Whereby, his private Trade he forward drives. Yet, these your failings, Providence Divine Employeth, oft, to further his intent, And, shall by this Digression now of thine, Make better use, than thy corruption meant. For, thereby both to others, and to thee, Occasion will be offer'd, to discover Some Observations, which will helpfull be, Your Wits, your Peace, and patience to recover. Oh! how can praises due to him be sung, Who, thus, extracts you gold out of your dung! By this thy giddie Rage, and blunt relating A branch of thy oppressions, wise men may Perceive on what their hearts are ruminating, Who twice as much have borne, yet lesse can say. And, thence, perhaps, their wisdome will collect, What may succeed, unlesse their care prevents The likely consequence, and ill effect Of Foes prevailings, and Friends discontents; From thence, it may be, they some hints will take, To mark proceedings better than they did; And, for the publike safetie, notice take Of Snakes, which underneath faire flowers lye hid. Thus, otherwhile, the failings of a Foole, By Providence, may set the Wise to schoole. But, why wert thou enrag'd? what wantest thou, That, with impatiencie, thou dost repine? What Peere, or Prince, in all these Ilands now, Enjoyes a Fortune that surpasses thine? Hast thou not bread, and cloaths enough, and more Than for the present day may well suffice? And, by that Friend, who kept thee heretofore, Assurance (for the future) of supplies? Hast thou not had a Promise of Protection, In all thy waies; assuring thee, that neither The Rage of War, of Famine, or Infection, Nor, all those joyned in one Plague together, Shall do thee harme, if thou in him confide, Whose aid to no Beleever is deni'd. Why shouldst thou feare, though thy estate is gone, (And Mercie fled) that thou, or thine, may want? Who know'st, man liveth not by bread alone, And, where, for asking, all things may be had? What need'st thou care, though they at last deceive thee, On whom thou didst repose an ample trust; Who hast an able Friend, that will not leave thee, Though all hopes else were buried in the dust? Why shouldst thou vex, to see Oppressours flourish, That hast beheld so many, in thy daies, Arise from nothing, and to nothing perish? And that the Part which ev'rie Tyrant plaies, How gloriously soever he ascends, In certaine shame, and sudden ruine ends? Wouldst thou be rich? what riches canst thou find Of greater worth, than truly to enjoy, At such a time as this, a setled mind, And such a state, as no man can destroy? Some thousands, who but few weeks past could say, That their Revenues, and their Incomes, were Enough to furnish them, for ev'rie day, With more than thine affordeth for a yeare; Have nothing left them now. Why striv'st thou then, To seek a certaintie, where can be none? To catch at that which flies from other men? To save thy selfe, when all is overthrowne? And (knowing what thou knowest) to desire To take a house, where all the Towne's on fire? Wouldst thou be honourable? where is he, That by the Bodily, or Ghostly Line, Derives his Being by a Pedigree, That ancienter, or nobler is, than thine? What more heroicall can be atchiev'd, Than, what no King can give, or take away? And by the King of Kings to be receiv'd Into that Order, whose true Badge, none may So much as know, but he that weares the same, And was twice borne? What honour is so great, As his, whom Povertie, Reproach, and Blame, Still more ennobles? And, who doth beget His honours out of those, who most contemne His Reputation; and, in spite of them? Thou hast been taught; and, thou dost seeme to know This Path to Honour; and yet taken art, With such vaine Bubbles, as from fancie flow: And, whereon, ev'rie worldling sets his heart. Cannot thy contemplations thee enable, To let the simple people dote upon Their Hobby-horse, their Fooles Cap, and their Bable, Because thy Fortune will afford thee none? Canst thou not passe, except a stone thou throw At ev'rie Cur that bawles? Nor, yet, forbeare Impatient, for those vanities, to grow, Whose emptinesse to thee discover'd are? For shame, let more conformity be shown, In practice, unto that which thou hast known. Who can expect (when they shall see or hear, With what distemper thou hast here exprest Thy private wrongs) that other men should bear Their sufferings well, when they are so opprest? If thou who know'st, what comforts do attend A calme, and patient bearing of the Crosse, What blessing crownes the Meek mans latter end, And with what riches GOD repaies his losse; Art so inrag'd; no marvell, if nigh mad Some others grow, who are as greatly pain'd, And want th'experiments which thou hast had, Whereby the wrongs may better be sustain'd. Is this the power? is this the strength of him, Who, somtimes, thinks he could the world contemn? Is this a time for thee, who hast made show Of better hopes, to scramble, with the Boyes, For Nuts and Apples? wilt thou struggle now, With Fooles and Slaves, for bables and for toyes? Contend thou not with Children, in their play; Nor strive thou their vaine longings to possesse: From Micah take thou not his Gods away, Lest they may bring thee to unhappinesse. Endeavour what is comly to be done, To reap the profit, which to thee belongs. Vse prudent meanes Oppressors pawes to shun; Or, to remove, or mitigate thy wrongs: And, to that purpose, having done thy best, Be patient, and to God commit the rest. And, to preserve this temper, warie be (Above all other times) when their despight And envie shall be exercis'd on thee, Who think, the Publike-Trust belongs, of right, To so much by the yeare: These, have so long Inslav'd the people; that themselves disgrac'd They do conceive, if, to do right or wrong, Inferiours, in Authority be plac'd: And, these have lately censur'd it unfit, That, with so reverend a thing, as Wealth, Such strangers, now, as Honesty, and Wit, Should called be, to serve the Common-wealth, Or lend a helping hand, to save, what they Have took a course to ruine, many a day. These, value men, according to the Rent Their Fathers left them: and, these cannot brook Without vexation, and much discontent, That, notice should of other worth be took. And, therefore, if it must be as these will; If your besotted people have a minde To be oppressed, to be fooled, still, And, to be kept, perpetually blinde; Straine not thy selfe, to helpe unlade an Asse That loves his burden; nor, his drivers trouble; But, let them, and their silly creature passe, Till they have made their scornes and mischiefs double. For, he that meddles with them, nothing gains, But kicks, and evill language, for his pains. Cast quite behind thee, what of their despite, Or injuries, to thee, hath been reported: Their open hate, with secret love requite; For evill, let not evill be retorted. Fret not thy self, although thou see them jeer, And Thee, and thy Authority deride: For, most, to whom their envy shall appear, Will laugh to scorne, their folly, and their pride. And, as thou soughtst it not, nor dost, yet, know, By whom, that seeming-honour was confer'd; So, whether thou continued be, or no, In thy imployments, give it no regard: For, thou shalt sit ere long, above their hate, And, their Commissions shall be out of date. While thou remain'st amongst them, do thy best To side with innocence; and do not there Of wicked prophanations make a jest; Curse those that curse; or swear at those that swear. Abuse not thy Authoritie or Place To favour knaves, or put good men to sorrow: Plead not for law, this day in one mans case, What, for another, shall be none to morrow. Vse not thy power, thy neighbours to enslave, As manie do who bettet things pretend, And, when thou chargest others, care to have That they against their Oathes do not offend, Take heed, thou mak'st more conscience of thine own Then others of their oathes, have lately showne. For, some of those, who fluently can preach Vpon the Bench, as tho (if need had bin) They could the Parson of the Parish teach To do his dutie in reproving sin: Even some of those, at that time countenance Known Malefactors, there, indicted for Crimes then in charge: and, shamelesly advance In practice, what in words, they do abhorre. When there, they have inveighed at abuses, Occasion'd by permitting an excesse Of licenc'd and unlicen'd tipling-houses, (And their suppression, urg'd with earnestnesse; (Instead of what they would appear to do) They seem to put downe one, and set up two. These are not pleas'd, that an observing-eye Is plac'd among them. And, perhaps, to prove Thy patience, these, their power ere long will trie: But, Thee to no distemper let it move. This, is a time of suffring: and, though men Are instruments each other to correct, Yet, GOD, himselfe employes them. Suffer, then, Without repining, what he shall inflict. Although thy foes oppresse, and friends forsake thee, Let no ill tydings make thy heart affraid, From thy first principles, let nothing shake thee, What ere against thee, shall be done or said: But, further what to Publike-peace belongs, And leave thou unto GOD, thy private wrongs. For, though it may be granted, that, if here Thou should'st illustrate all things which concern Thy usages (but onely in that Shire Where thou hast liv'd) thy Readers might discern In what condition manie others are Who truly, serve the Publike: yet, take heed Lest following thine own suffrings over-far May tediousnesse, or sleighting of them breed. Be watchfull too; lest by much musing on Thy personall affronts, a selfe-respect May cause mis-censures to be cast upon The Publike Justice, to her dis-respect. For men opprest, and griev'd in an extreme, Look, not alone with sullennesse, upon Those Parties that are thought to injure them, And on their own oppressions, as if none Had borne the like; but, also, as if cleare They from all blame, in all their suffrings, were. And, in a publike Grievance, scarce a man Among a thousand, searcheth out those things Which mis-befall, so farre as they began, To find the Fountaines, whence the mischief springs. Most men (and thou among the rest for one) Can spie out many others, much to blame, But, few men heed what they themselves have done, Whereby the Plague so generall became. And, whence soev'r it comes, the Male-content Though in the Persons he the cause may find, Fomes out his venome on the Government, And, to a change is presently inclin'd. Whereas, the mischiefe, still, the same will be Vntill there be a change in such as He. Ev'n some of you, (and manie is that some) Who to the skies, this Parliament have rais'd, With whom, it was almost a GOD become, And such, as never could enough be prais'd. This Parliament, in whose defence you stand Till all your pretious things, are well nigh wasted, Till warre, hath marched quite through all the land, Till bitternesse, in all your sweets is tasted; Till into pieces, Families are torne, Vntill with blood, your wayes, and streets do run, Till Towns, and Towers, and Temples down are borne, Till Prince and Peasant, are almost undone; Till Famine, too, beginneth to appeare, Which in long Warfares, bringeth up the reare. This Parliament, for which you suffer so, And for whose preservation beare you would Ten times as much, might you before-hand know, What, (if it prosper'd not) ensue there should; Ev'n to this Parliament, so highly priz'd, You in your former love are growing slack. This your Diana, is by some despis'd: Of your Distractions, her the cause you make. On her, you laid the burthen and the blame, (As if due care she wanted, or fore-sight) When disadvantage, or dishonour came By ill successe in counsell, or in fight; And murmured, as if your hearts had said, That, by your Parliament, you were betrai'd. Such is your folly, (madnesse I might say) That, some among you, so your selves expresse As if you thought it much advantage may The Publike Cause, to bring her faithfulnesse, Or prudence into question: For, you heare, Collect, report, and have dispersed, so, All scandalls, and dis-trusts, which malice reare; And, daily give such credence thereunto, That, you (who seeme to be unfained Friends Vnto this Parliament) have, thereby, done Those mischieves to it, which the Foe intends; And will destroy it, if this course you run: Yea, this your folly, will more weaken it Then all your cunning Adversaries wit. For, this imprudencie will by degrees Your bones unsinnew, and your joynts untie: By this, you both their hands and hearts will leese, Who, in your Quarrell, vow'd to live and die. What Devill then hath tempted you, in this, To sin against your soules? and, blinds you so That, you observe not whose design it is Which you now further, and whose work you do? The honour of that Senate, is the power, And life thereof; and, on the life of that, Dependeth ev'ry Priviledge of your, Belonging to your temporall estate; And, peradventure, some way doth extend, That being, to concern, which hath no end. It is your duty, therefore to discerne And labour the defence of that which may Your being, and well-being so concerne: And, to that purpose, there is much to say, For, though it be your strongest Creature-guard Against Oppressors; yet, you can expect No safer Tutelage to be confer'd Thereby, then what a Creature may effect. It labours your protection; but, alas! The worke is great, and through much opposition, And manie difficulties, they must passe, To bring this Land, into a safe condition. For to restore you to your peace agen, 'Tis now, a work for GOD, and not for men. You heed their failings; but, you heed not yet (Nor fullie can conceive) how hard a worke They have to do, nor how they are beset With enemies; nor what obstructions lurke In these proceedings, which make show to be Without a rub, to them who stand aaloof, And have not opportunitie to see What stops may rise, before they come to proofe. Their own infirmities, as they are men (And which you ought to wink at) may perchance In this great enterprize, be now, and then, Occasions of no little hinderance: For, who but GOD, alone, can perfect be? Or, who is fit for such a work, but he? The haynous sins, and manie obdurations, Of that great Bodie, whom they represent, And of those froward, and divided Nations, Which are concerned in their Government, Give being unto many sev'rall things, And actions, whence, oft-times, an accident Vnlooked for; or some hid mischiefe springs, Which humane policie cannot prevent. When Israel sinneth, Benjamin that hath A wicked cause, their Brethren down shall smite, To expiate the just avengers wrath, Before the cause prevailes, that is upright: Whilst in the camp an Achan doth remain, These Counsell, and your Souldiers fight, in vain. Though Moses govern'd you, though Josuah were Call'd up to be your Armies Generall; And Davids Worthies now revived, here, To be your Colonells, events would fall Below your hopes, whilst unrepented sin Is, wilfully, conniv'd at: For, that, made Your Parliaments unprosprous; that, hath been Chiefe cause of all their failings they have had. And, then, beside this hindrance, and this bar To their successe, they have a powerfull foe Opposing them as well by force of war, As by what fraud and tyrannie can do: And, that their Faith and stoutnesse may appear, A muster of their foes I give you here. Their Generall in chiefe is ANTICHRIST, And, he the main Battalia, now, commands: Which, of those armed Locusts doth consist On whose Activitie his Empire stands. Lievtenant-Generall, is he that strives A conquest of your Liberties to make; And counts it one of his Prerogatives, As he shall please, your goods, to give and take. He leads the Van; in which, with him appeares Those Princes, and those Nobles, who still are, And were at first, the wicked Councellers, Who did encourage him unto this war; And he of broken Courtiers, up hath made (And of some beggar'd Lords) all this Brigade. The Major-Generall, (who bringeth on, The right wing of this Armie) is the Prince Of broken-fortunes; who still falls upon The Carriages, and Baggage, that from thence He may recruit. His ragged Regiments (Beside those lousie, and those tatter'd fellowes Late pressed for him, out of Beggers Rents, And freed from the prisons, and the gallowes) Were patch'd up, out of Bankrupts, cast-Commanders, Cashier'd Bandettees, Fellowes of the pot, Debauched Players, Tapsters, Gamesters, Panders, With such, as in a drunken fit were got To beare them companie. And, these are they Who first made plunder seem a lawfull prey. The left wing, by Pope would be, ordered is; A stately Prelate, and one, for whose sake, (Though he the Triple-crown is like to misse) The war, now rais'd, did first beginning take. He, heads a Partie of as desp'rate mates, As e're drew sword: and, manie of them be Both disciplin'd to make Assasinates, And readie for it, when their time they see. Among these, march some prudent-seeming men, Some, that, more honestie then wealth do want: Some wittie fellowes; but, not one for ten Of those, that are extreamlie ignorant; The openly prophane, the closelie vitious, The Papists, Atheists, and the Superstitious. The Rear is brought up by a Libertine, That is for anie Doctrine or opinion: For any Government or Discipline, For Protestant, for Brownist, for Arminian, Or, anie thing he pleases. And, he gives This libertie (so far as they are able To make it good) to all, whom he receives Into his Troopes; which are innumerable: For, all that would their wicked lusts fulfill, All they, who Law, and Order do contemn; All they, that are ambitious of their will, Ev'n all of these, unite themselves to him: And, in his quarters, manie women too Are found, who, not a little mischiefe do. These Forces, both asunder and united, Have so obstructed, and so manie waies, This Parliament opposed, and dispighted, In all their consultations, and assaies; They have by sleight of wit, by strength of hand, By Treacheries, by Treaties, and by Spies Abroad, and here at home; by Sea, and Land, By Protestations, Promises, and Lies, And, by a thousand other tricks, beside, Pursu'd such meanes and courses to distract, Affright, discourage, weaken, or divide, And, frustrate what they shall advise or act; That,'tis no wonder you have sped no better, But, rather, that the mischieves are no greater. For, if beside the disadvantages Which have occurred to this Parliament, (By open enemies) you now shall please To take true notice of the detriment Sustain'd by them, who seeme no adversaries; Or them, who friend-like in your Quarters live; Whose hand, at once, both fire and water carries; And, mean worst actions, when best words they give: If you shall heed, how they have cheated bin With honest showes, and outward pietie, When there was little, or nought else, within But rotten falshood, and hypocrisie, You would not murmur, as if you had thought, This Parliament had failed you in ought. Nay, you their power and prudence would extoll, Or his great wisdome, rather, and his power, Whose mercies are exceeding wonderfull, That, quite you were not ruin'd, ere this houre: And, marvaile that your Senate could subsist Another day; if trulie you did know How manie moneths, a dang'rous Vipers-nest, Did in the verie bosome of it grow; Or, if you had a perspective, to see What Engines are still moving to unfix them; VVhat failings, yet, in their own Members be, VVhat foolings, in their fav'rites, to perplex them, And, what a New Division now they run, Vnthought on, when this Parliament begun. For, that divided Clergie, out of whom (As thou fore-saw'st, and didst, long since, fore-show) The present Plagues upon these Lands are come, (And by whose factions they will endlesse grow, If not prevented) have betwixt them got Another Quarrell, and another Creature, Of which, the world abroad yet heareth not; And which, till now, among the things of Nature Had not a Being. Nay, it hath not yet, So true a Being (though it hath a name) That any man may so discover it, As truly to expresse, or know the same. For, 'tis not what it was; nor will it stay To be to morrow, what it is to day. It is indeed a Thing, which neither had, Nor shall, nor can have any certaine shape; A thing, in making still, but never made, A Card drawne out of some Vtopian-Map, To make your Pilots steere they know not whither, Till they arrive at the Antipodes To saving Truth; or, else be carried thither By many changing winds, on moving Seas, Where they shall split upon the rockie shores Of Heresie; or suffer shipwrack there, Where melancholy Desperation rores; Or else, into those Creeks be driven, where They moored lye in dull Securitie, Or, land upon a Carnall Libertie. Your Linsie-woolsie Faction (not appearing So Jesuited as they are) made use Of Simon Magus (a bewitching hearing) And, by that Sorcerer, did late infuse This fancie, and it hath occasioned Such diffrence in Opinions, and so rent Men from each other, that the same hath bred Obstructions, which disturb the Parlament, In their proceedings. Yet, your enemie, By whom this late unlooked for Offence First came, shall not effect his end thereby. But, they who are to be approv'd, shall thence Draw Observations, and a pious use Of meanes unthought on, which will Good produce. For, at the present, though Offence be given, And, men of Belial, by Deceiving-lights, Have, to their pow'r, endeavoured and striven, To work their ends, by cheating of your sights, With false appearances, and shewes of Good; And, though right pious men, who see faire showes, And, have not yet their purpose understood, Do, for a little while adhere to those; Yet, when (by triall, and assisting-Grace) The bottome of it, fully is discern'd, The work desired shall be brought to passe: Yea, by this wrangling, somewhat shall be learn'd, To bring a prudent Reformation in, And make it purer than it would have bin. The Publike Peace, then, interrupt you not, Nor vex your private spirits, to promove Those Fancies, which Distemp'rature begot, And will, at last, not worth your owning prove. Let not Demetrius, to maintaine his trade, Make up-roares in the Land; as if more care Were of his Occupation to be had, Than, of those things, which of most value are, But, let Discretion teach you to appease Tumultuous spirits, by some sweet allay; Which, peradventure, shall prevaile with these. Not only, to give eare to what you say; But, also, for the Truth, to be ere long, As zealous as they were, to do it wrong. So foolish be not, as to shut your eyes, Or stop your eares, from all that seemeth new; Or, all things, as new fangles, to despise, Which, at first sight, seeme uselesse, or untrue. So furious be not, as to prosecute, With an uncharitable prosecution, All those who (in opinion) shall not suit With Disciplines, of your own Constitution. Nor, be so mad, as, wholly, to deface All Superstructures, on the true Foundation, Which are not uniforme, to that which was; Or, that which shall be setled in this Nation. For, to avoid great inconveniences, Wise-men will beare with inconformities. Those Doctrines, that make void the Morall-Law; Those, that the Fundamentalls do infringe Of saving-faith: Those, that mens hearts withdraw From Pietie, or, give the flesh her swinge: Those Disciplines, that breake the bands of Peace; That interrupt the Civill-Government; That sleight the meanes of Pieties increase, Or, courses, that Ill-manners may prevent: These, are not to be borne with. These, you may, Nay, these you must, (with all your power) suppresse; And fine, confine, cut off, or send away, According as the fault is, more or lesse: And, so, that you may therewithall improve GODS praise, the Kingdoms Peace, &amp; Christian love. And, if that anie one can means propose, Whereby your duties may be better done; If anie person, can a truth disclose, Which hath been clouded, since the Day begun: If he can tell you, or, believes he can Informe of anie thing, that may concerne GODS glorie, or the saving health of man; And, thinks himselfe (to teach, and you to learn) Oblig'd in conscience: And, if he shall so Proceed, (in doing that which he supposeth, The Will of GOD requireth him to do) That, no ungodly aime his Course discloseth, Or, ought which doth your, Publike-peace annoy; Why, such a Freedom, should he not enjoy? If anie man a tender conscience hath, Which makes him fearfull, to offend the same, And, therewith walkes in so discreet a Path, That, he deserveth not a publike-blame, In anie point aforesaid: Why should he Be wrought upon, by anie other course Save that, whereby the heart may wooed be By Grace, and Faith, and Reason, without Force? How shall the Gospells passage be so cleare, As is desir'd, and as thereto is due, If all men be not free to speake and heare, On such conditions, as before we shew? Since, to the Church, compulsion none invites, But, some few fooles, and manie hypocrites. Coercive power indeed is to be us'd In things which to the Outward-man pertaine; And wherein words or actions have abus'd Those Lawes, which words or actions, do restraine; The plots preventing, or the practices, Which root up those Foundations, whereupon You are to build up Piety and Peace; Or, remedie an evill, being done: Or, for expulsing, or correcting those, Whose principles, whose practice, and profession, Doth diametrically, that oppose Which GOD and Nature, puts in your possession; As Popelings, or such like, who do resist Essentially, the Government of CHRIST. But, he that dreames, by anie Humane-Law, To force Belief, or bind the Inner-man, To think, to hope, to love, or stand in awe; Dreames, to effect, what none accomplish can. For, this, would be a tyrannie far worse Then to inslave the bodie. This, doth lay, Strong fetters on the Soule; and, would enforce The Reason, if not, take it quite away. By this, you, to dissemble, may be brought, Or, else, to feare: But, never to beleeve, Or hope, or love aright, or, Change a Thought. Nay, this would, rather, so inrage and greeve, As that, in stead of propagating Peace, Your Quarrells it would ev'rie day increase. Make then, in things Divine, GODS Word your Law, In Naturals, let REASON be your Guide; And, from no Civill-Pow'r obedience draw, Which doth conformable to these abide. Heare all; but, give assent to what is best: Prove all, who in the name of CHRIST shall come; But, choose that, only, which abides the Test: And, Truth once found, the same depart not from. Let no true Principle be chang'd, or shaken, Let not an ancient Bounder be removed; Or, Ceremoniall-Precepts be mistaken, For Moralls; nor a Shaddow be improved Before the Substance. Quarrell not away The Essence of Religion, or of Peace, For Trifles; which, though them enjoy you may, Will never bring you to that happinesse, VVhich you expect: And, which will make your sorrow, No lesse to day, and more, perhaps, to morrow. Be not so foolish, as to pull downe all, That was set up before; as if you thought The Government, because Prelaticall, VVas not to be adhered to in ought. For, therein, without question, have remain'd (Among their vaine Inventions) many things, VVhich, to the Church, in purest times, pertain'd; And, whereto, none a just exception brings. Be not so indiscreet, to sweep out these, Among their rubbish; or, to take away Those Vtensils, or those Indifferences, Which for conveniencie, still keep you may, (And edifying too) without abuse; Or, anie vain or superstitious use. Be not so sottish, as to think, the Way Now termed Independent, nothing hath By which the Throne of CHRIST advance you may, Depresse his foe, or else prepare his path: Or, that, GOD may not, yet, some beame reveale, Or, branch of truth, unto his Church disclose, Which he hath hitherto kept under-seale; Or, whereof yet, he scarce a glimmering showes. Nor, let those whom you Presbyterians name, Of their own structures be so confident, As to conceive, there may not to that Frame Of Discipline, which they to you present, Additions or substractions, yet, be made, To make more perfect, that which they have had. So inconsiderate, let no man grow, As to believe it ever was intended, By taking of your Covenant and Vow, The Scots-Presbyterie should be befriended Without respect, to whatsoever might Be found, upon due triall, to accord With those instructions, which to set you right, GOD giveth, in the Canon of his WORD: Nor, misconceive you so that noble Nation, As to suppose, they think their Church is growne To such perfection in true Reformation, That, thereon, nothing more may be bestowne: Or, that, they come to set you one way free, That, you, another way, inslav'd might be. Mistake not so their pietie and love; But, be assured that what you and they Vpon deliberate advise may prove, To be the safe, unquestionable way Wherein you ought to walk; that they will joyne, (VVhether unto the Civill-Peace it tends, Or, unto Doctrine, or to Discipline) As your affectionate, and faithfull Friends. Nor, let them so mistake you, or these times, Of publike Visitations, as to dreame, That either private weaknesses, or crimes, Shall hinder GODS intended work, in them: But, let both Nations labour to excell, In right beleeving, and in doing well. The way to Peace is rather to be just, And faithfull in your selves, and to rely On GOD; than to suspect, or to distrust, Or quarrell with anothers honestie. The way to Peace, is downe along the Vales Of Meeknesse, leaving quite behind your backs The hils of Pride, and those partition wals, VVhich Selfe-conceitednesse, and Selfe-love makes. The way of Peace, is to examine more Your owne Offences, and your neighbours lesse; To learne more Charitie than heretofore; To be in Deed, what you in Word professe; And not to strive who long'st shall keep the field, Against the Truth; but, who shall soonest yeeld. Thus far, is this Discourse, now, carried on, That, it may shew both what is pertinent To Outward Peace, and what is to be done, The losse of inward quiet to prevent. For, as there be False lights, of late, set out, VVhich give occasion unto some to wander In giddie paths, to make some also doubt, VVhere is no cause; or, else to bring a slander On sacred Verities; ev'n so, there are True-lights, of late discover'd, which long since By evill-meaning Builders, stopped were: And, they who would nor give, nor take offence, Must learn, more perfectly, to understand (Then yet they do) those things they take in hand. Desire of Vniformitie, doth carrie So great a sway with some, as if it were Vnto the Church of CHRIST, as necessarie As VNITIE, or, did the same appear. But, they are wide: For as within a pallace, There may be more conveniency, more state, More beautie, and more pleasure for the solace Of him that builds it, when there are, in that, Some equall Structures; higher some, some lower, Some pyramids, some flats, some rounds, some squares, With here a single, there a double tower, And such like, as in Princely Piles appears; So, in the Church, true comlinesse, may be, And Vnion, without uniformitie. Nay discords, do not generally marre Essentiall unity: For, as you finde Some notes, which sounded, by themselves, do jarre, Make up, when they are musically joyn'd, A perfect Diapason: so, may they The unitie of love, and faith retain, Who walke not uniformly in the way, Yet, on the true foundation, fixt remain. And, as for those poore creatures, who through pride, And ignorance, have now impostumations Of fancie broken in them, which they void At mouth, upon the sillie Congregations Collected by them; be not discontent That, they with others, their corruptions vent. For, such like bubbles, still, were wont to rise In such disordered times: And, they will fall Of their own selves. The wind that yet supplies Their tumour, when Peace coms, quite break them shall. The Devill of their proud simplicitie, Makes use, at present, to delude that rabble, Which are in love with their owne vanitie, And, in the waies of Pietie unstable. Because, a Prudent-Preaching wonders wrought, And Carnall wisdome judg'd it Foolishnesse; By foolish preaching, these have, therefore, thought, Their Arrogancie shall prevaile no lesse; But, GOD, when they repent, will free these Nations, From all such failings, and Infatuations. Observe this well, and, in true patience, beare With one another, till God shall make knowne, To what intent these broiles permitted are; And, let your discontents be rather showne, Vpon the Common Foe: Yea, do your best, (Whilst you have meanes) to settle outward Peace, According to your pow'r; and, for the rest, Depend on GOD, who sees the faithfulnesse Of ev'rie Soule: And, suffer not vaine jars, Among your selves, to multiply contention; Lest you, thereby, both make these present wars, To bring forth an incurable dissention; And, hinder (as you have already done) That Work, which God, among you, hath begun. Such differences, obstructions have begot Retarding Peace. But, doubtlesse, for the same, To your great Senate, there belongeth not An imputation of the smallest blame. Nor, were it faultie, though it could be said, And proved too, that some among them, now, Their weightie consultations had betrai'd, And, to your Foes, their secrets daily show. Nor, ought they to be blamed, though you see A Spider sent among them, for an Ant; A Butterfly, or Hornet, for a Bee; Or, those that wit, or honestie, do want: For such, when they are found, they still cast from them, With as much forwardnesse, as doth become them. But, they, they only, do deserve the blame, Of all those falshoods, which these Lands disease) Those brainlesse fellowes, who had so small shame, And little grace, to make their choice of these: Those (falsly termed) free-men, who, for porredge, Would sell their birth-right; and, who, to uphold Their lawfull freedomes, have not so much courage, As to maintaine them, though they see they could. They, whom a pettie Justice, by the nose, May lead to what absurdities he pleases; And, make them think, he favour to them showes, When he their losse, and slaveries increases; These, and their fellow Burgers, have undone you; Their slavishnes, hath brought these plagues upon you. These, to the House of Commons, sent that Rabble Of Runawayes, and Traytours, which betrai'd Your liberties, as much as they were able: And, on their heads, the bloud is justly laid, For what you suffer. These were, first, unjust, In sending in, to be their Deputies, In stead of men, Pride, Avarice, and Lust, Oppression, Folly, Fraud, and Vanities. These, having neither honestie, nor wit, Nor care to make a prudent choice of those, To whom so great a Trust, they should commit, Some persons, for the publike service, chose, So like themselves; that, wonder it is none, To see so many do, as they have done. For, such a choice they passed, that unlesse Some prudent Boroughs, and some wiser Shires Had made elections with more warinesse, And sent brave spirits forth, to ballance these, You had been quite undone; and you, and yours, Of all the Christian world had been the scorne; Perpetuall Bond-slaves to malignant Pow'rs; And, hated of your children, yet unborne: For, ever, therefore, let that providence Which so provided for you, be renown'd: And, let there be a blessed difference On them, and on their seed, for ever found, To honour them, and mark them out from those, Who to the publike welfare, now, are foes. And, let your Burgers, and Free-holders learn In time to come, how much, how neare it may The publike, and their private weale concern, To be advis'd, on whom their trust they lay: For, what is more unsafe or more unwise Then to commit (as manie times they do) Their goods, their persons, liberties, and lives, Yea, and the meanes of their salvations too, To their disposures, whom they rather fear, Then well affect? of whom no good they know? Of whose corruptions, frequently, they hear, Of whose injustice, sinsible they grow? Whose worths, are their revenue? and whose wit Is meere formalitie, or nev'r-a-whit? What can be more absurd, then to suppose They are the wisest men in all the Shire, And fit'st for publike service, to be chose, Who wisest, in their own opinions are? Who come uncall'd, and shuffle out their choice By suit and friends, or having got, perchance, The overplus of one poore single voice, With much ado, their purpose to advance? Or, what a greater indiscretion showes, Then to elect for Giver of your Lawes, A fellow, that nor Law, nor Gospell knowes? Nor difference, 'twixt a good, and evill cause? And, till that day, pursued no other course But, hunting, hawking, or else somwhat worse? What, more dishonourable can be thought, Then, to your Court and Senate most supreme, (For which the worthiest persons should be sought) To send a foole or knave, to sit with them, Whose reverend presence should not be polluted With such companions? or, what one thing may A truer signe of madnesse be reputed, Then thus to foole their dignitie away? For, since they cannot their debates decide, But by most Voices, what else will ensue, (If manie places, be with such suppli'd) But, those events, which all the Land will rue, When worst designes, are by the most promoted, And, reason shall, by noise, be over-voted? There never was a time, in which you ought To be more carefull of your choice then now, If you recruit your House: For, men are taught By this long Parliament, so well to know Each others minde, each others interest And inclination; that, unlesse you see The number wanting, in due time increast, And made compleat, by men that worthie be; You will be as assuredly undone, As if the King had tyranniz'd; nay, more: For, to oppresse you, there had been but one, But, then, you shall, perhaps, have many a score. And therefore, as you here fore-warned are, In your elections, use more prudent care. Thy Letters of Advice, ere while directed To those in whom the choice of these doth lie, Have partly signifi'd what was effected; And, what events will still ensue thereby, While such are chosen; And, what Caveats ought To be observed, that a better choice May be hereafter; and, that men be sought Who wit and conscience have, aswell as voice. For, these defects breed vip'rous wormes within The verie bowells of the Parliament, More dangerous then outward foes have bin. And, if the Members wanting, be not sent With better heed, then heretofore you tooke; For peace embracing truth, in vain you looke. Let therefore, those true Patriots which are left, Put forth a strong endeavour to compleat Their wasted number, e're they are bereft Of power, and meanes, themselves to re-beget Into a perfect bodie. And, let none By fallacies delude you, with a feare, It may not now as legally be done, As when the Members first convented were, For, that they are a lawfull Parliament, (Although the King be absent) 'tis confest Ev'n by the King: In whom, now to prevent Their being so, the power doth not consist, Nor ever did, of right; while cause you know, Why SALVS POPVLI, should have it so. Believe it, whosoever shall pretend This Parliament, hath not a legall power Her bodie to recruit; is no true friend, Nor fit to be a Councellour of your. For, seeing they have power to make a Seale, It were a great absurditie to dreame, They had not legally, a power, aswell To use, as make it. And, if you in them, Allow an use thereof, that private men, The benefit of justice might obtain; It should much rather be allowed, then, In things, which to the Publike-right pertaine: And, most especially, in all affaires Concerning their own being, and repaires. If really, a Parliament they be As (without peradventure) they are One, Then, without limitation they are feee To do, what may by Parliaments be done. And, that is, ev'rie reasonable thing Which to their weale and safety may belong; (And their abilitie to passe may bring) If to Divinity, it be no wrong. And, whosoe're, in these extremities, Perswade, that they should take upon them lesse; Vnto the publike peace, are enemies: Yea, they deferre, or marre your happinesse, By weakning of their hands, who are your friends; And, strengthening his, who now your spoile intends. Let them not therefore act, as if they had But halfe a power, or seemed to be lame; Or, as if they a Parliament were made, To be no more, but only, so in name. With prudent conscience, and with confidence, Let them proceed in what they undertake; And, in what e're pertaines to their defence, On just resolves, let them no haltings make, Through want of presidents: For, power they have To make new presidents, as well as they Who liv'd before them. And, if they will save Their Countrie and themselves, this is the way: Since, in an extarordinarie Cause, True Reason, binds as firmly, as the Lawes. And, though it greatly grieve you (as it ought) Yet suffer not the absence of the King, To foole you, with so frivolous a thought, As that, a diminution it may bring To their authority. For, wheresoe're He bideth, when his Parliament shall sit, The Kingship, vertually, is alwaies there, And cannot possibly divide from it. The Person of a King, may ramble forth, As his own fancie hurries him about, Or do things derogating from his worth, Or die, or from the Kingdome be cast out; And, yet the Kingdome, and the Kingship too, Continue still, as they were wont to do. The life of Bodies-naturall, indeed, Departs out of them, when their head is gone; And, thereunto, no other can succeed, To make it live, or, not a headlesse-one. So 'tis not in this Bodie-politike: The vitalls of it in the body lie, Not in that head-ship: and, though it be sick When that falls from it, yet, it doth not die. A King, is but a substituted-head, Made for conveniencie: And, if thereby The bodie seem to be indangered, (If Power it hath) it hath Authoritie To take one off, and set another on; Aswell, as, at the first, to make it one. And when that Body shall be represented, As this hath been, according to the Law, Or, shall be by necessity convented; Therein resides, that Soveraignty, that Awe, And Rule, whereto the Lawes of GOD and nature Injoyne obedience; and not in that thing Corrupted; which was but that Creatures creature, And, which to serve it, was first made a King. When, therefore, GOD injoynes you to obey And honour Kings; these duties, are not meant To those who from their Kingships run away; But, rather, to th'essentiall Government Of whatsoever kind, by Law ordain'd; Or, by a strong necessity constrain'd. For, were it otherwise, the pride, and lust Of an injurious Arbitrary power, Would all men out of their possessions thrust, And all the freedomes of mankind devoure. Let therefore, neither fear nor flattery, Prescription, or vaine custome, make you cleave Vnto an accidentall Majesty, And, that which is substantiall, quite to leave. At this time, chieflie, take a speciall care (As, of what verie much conduceth to Your Peace and Safety) that, as now things are, Your just advantages you let not goe; Lest, by a faint, and cowardly endeavour, You loose your freedoms, and be slaves for ever. And, yet take heed, that zeal to Innovations, Nor private fears, nor hopes incline your minde To subjugate these Kingdoms, or these Nations, To Governments of anie other kind. But, rather use your utmost diligence To rectifie those things which are amisse In that which is establish'd: and, from thence Cast out or purge, whatever therein is Repugnant to those Charters, which by grace Or nature were confer'd: And, let your care Be so to settle it, that place you make The Throne of CHRIST, among you, up to reare; Lest, when his Kingdome comes, you els be fain To pull your new-devices down again. Take likewise heed, that you no meanes neglect, Whereby the King may be reclaim'd and won, GODS honour, with your safetie to respect; And do the duties, he hath left undone. For, by rejecting him, how just soe're The Causes be; you shall delay the peace, Which is desir'd: And make your quarrell, here, With much more difficultie to decrease: But, if your industrie shall win him home, And, he return sincerely to his charge, It shall a blessing to these Isles become; Your honour, and your joy it shall inlarge, And, as CHRISTS Vice-Roy, he shall sit upon A righteous, and an everlasting Throne, Walk, therefore, prudently in this straight path, And, turn not to the left hand, or the right. That pow'r, which GOD to you committed hath, Improve for him, according to your might; Him, in the reasonable-meanes attend With Faith, and Patience; that, he may, at last, Your King new-moulded, back unto you send, Or, him, out of his ruin'd Kingdome cast. If, possibly, he can his course repent, GOD, will restore him, yet. If you amend, Then, all these Troubles, and this grievous Rent, Shall in true Peace, and sweet agreements end. If both conforme; Both, shall true Peace enjoy: If both be wilfull, GOD, shall both destroy. But, heark! my Scribe, I heare a dreadfull crie Of wounded men; and, therewith, as it were, The shouts of those that have a Victorie, Of much concernment. Therefore, go and heare, What now is done: For, somewhat hath been wrought, From whence, if well it shall improved be, Enlargements of those meanes will forth be brought, Which may effect, what thou desir'st to see. As soone as thou hast Information had, Of what is rumoured, and duly weigh'd, What profitable uses may be made Of that, which either hath been done, or said: Retire thou hither, and give eare, again, To that, which to your Peace, doth appertaine. The fourth Canto. When from attention to that Silent-tongue, Which, without words, reveales what you have heard, I came abroad; the Streets, and Temples rung Of Victories: and, Signalls there appear'd, Not only, of a valiant Resolution, In those that conquer'd; but, of some divine Disposure of them, too, for execution Of that, which GOD himselfe, did fore-designe. The scornfull Adversaries rushed on, To Policie, and Strength, themselves commending. The LORD of Hosts, our Friends reli'd upon, With Prayers fighting, and with Faith defending: And, lo, GOD gave their Foes into their hand: For, when he fighteth, who can then withstand? The Victorie was great, and ev'rie one Observ'd what circumstances pleas'd him best; But, that, my thoughts did most insist upon, (Which others, peradventure, minded least.) These Royall-Ensignes from the Field were brought, The Lion-Rampant, and the Dragon-flying, The Roses, and Portcullis; which, me thought, Were Pledges, future Mercie signifying. And, so, no doubt, they shall be, if that Race, To which GOD calleth us, we now shall run; And better heed the tokens of his Grace, And, Earnests of his love, than we have done. For, valiant Fairfax, now, hath sent us home, In Hieroglyphick, signes of things to come. The Ramping-Lion, (which doth signifie A Raging-Tyrant) may an Earnest be, That, GOD will from oppressing Tyrannie, Vpon our Good-abearing, set us free. A Dragon, is that most prodigious Beast, Whereby the Holy-Ghost hath typifi'd That Foe, by whom the Saints are most opprest; And, by whom, daily, they are crucifi'd. The taking of that Ensigne, may fore-shew, That (if we faithfully the work endeavour) The pow'r of Antichrist we shall subdue, And, from these Islands, cast his Throne for ever. Vouchsafe us pow'r, ô GOD! vouchsafe us Grace, To drive him, and his Angels, from this Place. The winning of the Roses, doth declare, That GOD will to those honours us restore, Wherewith he crown'd us, when in peace, and war, We on our Crest, those lovely Flowers wore. Their blushing Beauties are, to me, a signe, Of that delightfull, and soule-pleasing grace, Which will make lovely our Church-Discipline, When GOD hath chang'd our Discords, into Peace. The sweetnesse, and the vertues of the Rose, Do seeme to promise to us those effects, And fruit, which from internall Graces flowes; Yea, and their prickles are, in some respects, Significant; for, I by them fore-see, That his corrections, alwayes, needfull be. By taking their Portcullis from the Foe, It may portend (and if with penitence, We prosecute the Work, it shall be so) That, we have taken from them their defence. It may betoken also, that GODS hand Will bar our Gates, and make our Citie strong, And, by his Mercie, fortifie the Land, Against all them, who seek to do us wrong. But, for a surer token of his Grace, GOD sends us home, among the spoiles of War, That Cabinet of Mischiefe, wherein was The proofe, of what our Foes intentions are: And, that, their projects, GOD will still disclose, And foole their Policies, this Prize fore-showes. I then observed, in that Victorie, (Wherewith GODS hand, at that time, magnifi'd The Peoples-Tribune) how much vanitie Is in the Arme of flesh, and vaunts of pride. And, with what good successe, he shall advance, Who seconded with Meeknesse, Faith, and Pray'r, Doth fight against the rage of Arrogance, Of Guilt, of Selfe-Dependence, and Despaire. I, furthermore observed, that this stroke Was given, by a Hand contemn'd of those, On whom it fell; and, that their strength it broke. When, to themselves, great hopes they did propose: Yea, when they seem'd assured of our fall; And thought to ruine, and devoure us all. And, they received that amazing-blow, From those Vnited-Brethren, whom they thought, Their policies had dis-united so, That, ruine on themselves, it should have brought. But, this, by their agreement, GOD prevented; And gave that victorie to be a signe, That, if we shall hereafter be contented, In love, against the Common-Foe to joyne; And, trust him with our Conscience, and our Cause; We, by that blessed union, shall subdue Th'opposers of our Liberties, and Lawes; And feel the droppings of Mount-Sions dew Be sprinkling all these Islands, with increase Of saving-knowledge, joyn'd with endlesse peace. I mustred up, the manie black-events, The manie jealousies, and new-made factions. The discontentments, and discouragements, The frights, the losses, dangers and distractions That might have follow'd, and o're-whelm'd us all, If but that day, our spoilers had prevail'd; If on that day, GOD had not heard us call, If on that day, to help us he had fail'd. And I desire, that we could thanks expresse For such deliv'rances, aswell, in deed, As in a Verball-form of thankfulnesse; That, GOD might alwaies our devotions heed, And answere us, when in distresse we pray, As he our prayers answered, that day. My heart rejoyced much in that salvation, Because, I knew it greater then it seem'd; And, that it wrappeth up a preservation, To few men knowne; of fewer men esteem'd. So much, I joy not in the victorie, As in that good, whereto it may conduce: For, in GODS Judgments, as much joy have I, As in his Mercies, when I see their use. I laugh not, as when I have outward ease, When I do feel GODS hand correcting me: Yet, inwardly, it comforts, and doth please As much, as when more glad I seeme to be. And, more I feare a failing, on my part, When I am most at ease, than when I smart. And, I have seene, so frequently, a failing, In prosecuting publike executions; And, such neglects (upon a small prevailing) Of good Designes, and prudent Resolutions. With such a dull proceeding in pursuit Of those advantages, which GOD bestowes: And find them, still, produce so little fruit In substance, answerable to their showes; That, when I should expresse my joyfulnesse, With such a sense as other entertaine: A melancholly doth my soule oppresse, As if it fear'd my joy would be in vaine; But, at that time, some better hopes I had, And, in those hopes, my Prayer thus I made. Eternall GOD! as mercifull, as just, And, of both these the Essence in perfection: Thou know'st my heart, and know'st I nor distrust Thy Pow'r, thy Providence, or thy Affection; Though outwardly I do not much rejoyce, It is not an unthankefulnesse to thee, That sads my Soule, or silenceth my Voyce, Whiles others tuning Hymnes of Praises be. For, oft, my heart, invokes thee all the day; Aloud to thee, my Spirit often cryes, When, with my mouth, I not a word can say, When not a teare will trickle from mine eyes: And, though I neither pray, nor praise thee, then, As I am bound; I do it as I can. Thy mercies I confesse, and am as glad Of Thee, and them, this day, as he that sings; Yet, when I mind what use of them is made, And, what effects from thy compassion springs, It mars my mirth: And therefore, now, in stead Of their thanksgiving Psalmes, I sacrifice My heart in Prayer; which, vouchsafe to heed, And, do not LORD, my humble suits despise. For, if thou grant them, it shall praise thee more, Thanif that favour, by ten thousand tongues, Were, at this present time, repeated o're, And celebrated in a thousand songs. That hath begot thee, one Thanksgiving-day. But, this, shall make thee praised, here, for aye. The many Mercies, LORD, I do confesse, Which, by thy Bountie, we have here enjoy'd, And, do acknowledge, with all thankefulnesse, That, ere this day, we had been all destroy'd, Vnlesse thy Goodnesse, and thy Providence, Had curb'd the furie of the raging Foe; Yea, thy Abounding-love was our defence, Or, we had, else, been our owne overthrow. From thy free favour, and preventing-grace, It doth proceed, that our despised Host Fled not before their Adversaries face; Or, fell not by them, who the field have lost: And, that, the Joyes which now our Citie hath, Are not, this day, in Askalon, and Gath. But, what will these prevailings be, at last, If Grace thou, likewise, give not to pursue Those victories, which thou bestowed hast; And, to improve the mercie thou didst shew? What will our sad rejoycings, at the length, And bloudy enterchanges, prove, O LORD? But, an impairing of our native strength, To make a passage for the Forraine-sword? And, what from our divisions, and the spoiles, Torne daily from each other, can arise, But utter devastation of these Iles? And, (which is worse than forraine enemies) Selfe-murthers? Or, perhaps, a Dearth so great, That, men shall kill each other for their meat? Such things have been; and such, for ought I see, May here befall us, ere these wars be done, If, thou permit our cruelties, to be As wilfully pursued, as begun. Thy judgements teach us, therefore, LORD, to feare; So, make us, thy forbearances to weigh; So, let thy kindnesses our hearts prepare, That, we no longer foole our Peace away. Let not the sighs, the prayers, and the cries Of thy afflicted children, be in vaine. Behold, how desolate their dwelling lies; Look on their wounds, observe how they are slaine; How many, of their Fathers, are bereft! How many widowes, desolate are left! Or, if this move thee not, mark how the Foe Blasphemes thy Name: See, with what height of pride Against thy Truth, his malice he doth show, And, how thy holy things he doth deride. Mark, what damn'd Oaths, and curses forth they roare, And, with what lyes and slanders they do wrong us: Mark, how they scorne the counsels of the poore, And, to betray us, how they lurk among us. Mark, how they play the hypocrites, array'd Sometime, like Bosome-Friends; sometime disguis'd With outward Sanctitie, while snares are layd, That, unawares thy Saints may be surpriz'd: And, let not us, who in thy Truth have joy'd, By those, who persecute it, be destroy'd. If not on us, yet, LORD, compassion take On those that shall out of our loynes descend; If not for our, yet, for thine Honour-sake, To these destroying times, impose an end. Ev'n for the sake of thy Beloved-One, Who, through our sides, is wounded by our Foes, Behold, what spoyles, what mischieves they have done, And help us, ere our sorrow helplesse growes. Teach us to see, and know, how miserable We are, and may be, if we persevere, As we begun; informe us how unable We are to save our selves, from what we feare: And, to consider, too, how worthlesse, we Are of that mercie, which I beg of thee. Vaine is the help of Armies, Foot, or Horse; Vaine is the pow'r of Nations, and of Kings; Vaine is united policie, and force; Vaine is the aid of all terrestriall things: Thou makest War; thou only makest Peace, And, out of nothing, canst create the same; Nay, out of that, which discords doth encrease, An everlasting Concord thou canst frame. Although the people, like huge waters, rage; The mountaines, yea, these Islands moved be; Thou, in a moment, canst the storme asswage, And, make all quiet, when it pleaseth thee. O LORD! command a Calme, command a Peace, That our unnaturall debates may cease. To us be reconcil'd, and (to begin That reconcilement) let us so endeavour, To breake the league, which we have made with sin, That Thou, and We, may now be friends for ever. Make, for us, an Atonement with our King, Let him perceive, in what his course will end: What Mischeeves evill Counsellours do bring, What Vengeance doth on Tyranny attend. Give him both sight, and sense, of that huge floud, Which threatens daily, to o'rewhelme his head; That roaring torrent, nay, that sea of bloud, Which, in these Iles, hath wilfully been shed. And, with his wronged, and enraged Nations, Make thou, for him, his Reconciliations. His heart, is in thy hand; and, if thou please, Thou canst returne him to us, wholly changed. Thou canst yet make us mutually, with ease, As deare, as if we had not been estranged. Thou that restor'dst Manasseh, canst restore Him to Himselfe, to Vs, and to thy Grace: And, it may glorifie thy goodnesse more, Than to advance another in his place. Yea, and for us, it shall be better too, If, with a true forgivenesse of each other, We, that have lately been divided so, Shall lovingly unite againe together. For, what more sweet, than when unkindnesse ends, In reconciling of divided friends? Thou know'st, O GOD! that we have no desire, To take from Him, or His, the Royall Throne, Or, pull it lower; but, to raise it higher, And, set him, rather, faster thereupon. Thou know'st, that though his courses we abhor, We love his Person, and would faine prevent That mischiefe, which he seemes to labour for. By hunting after his owne detriment. If, by his wilfulnesse, that bloud be spilt, Which we would save; of them require it, LORD! Who make him to be Patron of their guilt; Or, bring him within danger of the Sword: And, keep us, and our children, ever cleare, From all the bloud, that shall be spoyled, here. And, as for me, whom our Opposers blame, As having my first principles forsaken, (Because I, now, against the Royall-Name, With Reall-Majestie, a part have taken) Thou know'st my heart, had never an intent, The Shadow, for the Substance, to adore: And, that if I, so foolishly had meant, Discretion, bids me so to think no more. A Single-Person, or a Factious Rabble, The King, by Armes, opposing, acteth Treason; But, Kingdomes joyn'd by Counsells-warrantable, Against a Tyrant, do the work of Reason. Yea, 'tis the hand of GOD, that strikes him, then, Although he doth it by the sword of men. Thou know'st, O GOD! that, not a hand of our Is rais'd against his Person, or his Seed; Or, to diminish any Royall pow'r, Which to discharge his Office he may need. Or, for due honour. But, we, rather, fight (As he would know, if undeceiv'd he were) To save his Dignitie, to do him right, And, keep him from Destructions drawing neare. Thou know'st, we no offensive War intended; Nor, armed came, for any private Cause; But, as our dutie binds, to have defended Thy Truth, our Countrie's Liberties, and Lawes: And, to remove the wicked from the Throne, That, he may rule, with righteousnesse, thereon. And, though to fright us from this dutie, LORD, The sons of Belial, whom we pursue, Cast termes on us, which better do accord With their proceedings, as to them most due: Yet, thou canst witnesse, that we called are, And, come in true obedience to that Pow'r, Of which, He but the name doth only weare; Whilst he abuseth his owne Rights, and our: Thou know'st his Wilfulnesse doth us compell (Since nor his Parl'aments, Thy Lawes, nor His, Nor, other course prevailes) now to appeale (In that, which at this time, depending is) To thy Arbitrement: and, that, the Sword May to our differences, an end afford. Wherein, we pray thee, passo thy Sentence so, That, in thy Judgements, Mercy may abound; Lest, though but small Severity thou show, The innocentest party, may be found Unable to abide it. For, mine eye, Which only can behold the scum, or skin, Of our Corruptions (and not much espie Of those Pollutions, which lie hid within) Perceives the best so faulty; that, by thee, If so put off this Bloodie-Triall were, That, we might, now, some other way, agree: It would the safest course, for both, appear. But, LORD, thy will be done, though it be that, Which flesh and blood, most feares and trembles at. For, who, that loves thy Attributes and Thee, And sees how they are sleighted? who, that viewes, How impudently broke thy Precepts be, How spightfully thy foes thy friends abuse; And, how presumptuosly this age goes on, (Ev'n while th'avenging Angell is abroad) To do as wickedly as it hath done, Without regard of man, or feare of GOD? Yea, who, that loves thine honour, grudgeth now Thy saving of it? or, who wisheth good Vnto thy Saints, who grieveth to allow Thy Justice, in avengement of their blood? Or, who can thinke thy judgements have exceeded, That hath our great offences duly heeded? I do confesse, thy coming to this Nation In these unlook'd-for Judgements, maketh it To be a sharp and dreadfull visitation To those, that in security did sit, And, liv'd at ease. But, they who long have born The violent oppressions of thy Foes, The insolence of Tyrants, and their scorn, At thy approaches, tremble not, like those: For, their Deliverer, and Friend appears, And, therefore, though we stand in awe of thee, It is with conjugall, and filiall fears, Mixt with whose tartnesse, sweetnesses there be: Yea, though thy judgments, fright us, when we hear them Yet, LORD, we love them, more then we do fear them. Whilest thus, or unto such effects I prai'd, And meditated, by my selfe alone, The VOICE began to speak again, and said; Thy GOD observeth, what thou musest on, And will not faile thy hopes, if thou believe, And persevere. For, he is readier farre, His blessings, and his benefits to give, Then, they, who want them, to desire them are. And, when he doth deny them, or prolong them, It is not out of backwardnesse in him, To condescend; but, that you might not wrong them, Or entertain them with a sleight esteem. Most, little prize good things, till much they cost, Few, know their happinesse, till it be lost. You may perceive, by that, which GOD hath wrought For these afflicted Isles, in their distresse; By manie things, which he to passe hath brought, When mischiefes were, almost, beyond redresse: By those diliv'rances, which you have had, When to the brink of ruine you were come; By those escapes, which he for you hath made, From plots, which none but he could save you from; Yea, see you may be his oft freeing you, When, carelesly, advantages you lose; And by that mercie, which he sheweth, now, That, he would soone secure you from your Foes, Could you so mind, what doth to you belong, That, mercie might not do his justice wrong. Alas! he takes no pleasure in your cries, By your afflictions he can reap no good; Your wounds, are not delightfull to his eyes, Nor joyes he in the shedding of your blood. He better likes of Feasts, then Fasting-dayes, If you could use them, to your more availe, Your mournings would not please, like songs of praise, If you had fewer failings to bewaile. He is not such a cruell GOD, as manie, Blasphemouslie, have fained him to be, Delighted in the death, or griefe, of anie; But, Love, and Joy essentiallie is he: And, gave his Dearest to be crucifi'd. A saving-health for sinners to provide: Of him, if peace you rightlie seek, believe it, He will vouchsafe it, when you shall appeare A people qualified to receive it: And, to expect it sooner, vaine it were. Your pride is not, as yet, enough abated, Your wisdom, is not, yet, enough befooled, Your own deservings, are, yet, over-rated, You, by the rod, are not, yet, throughly schooled. You have some ayerie Castles, yet, in building, Some false dependencies, yet, undestroy'd, Some groundlesse hopes, not to despaire, yet, yeelding, Some lusts, and some vaine pleasures, yet injoy'd: And, manie such obstructions, making, yet, These Kingdoms, for that happinesse, unfit. Your lofty minds, must, first, be stooped lower, Your separations, must draw, somwhat, nigher, Your Formes of godlinesse, must get more power, Your base affections must be lifted higher: Your headstrong wilfulnesse, must more be tamed, Your Anchor, must with deeper hold, be grounded, Your Charity, must farther be inflamed, Your Faith, must on the rock, be better founded. Your selves, must, by your selves, be more deni'd, More care of publike duties must be took; Your wanton flesh must more be mortifi'd, And, for your sins, your hearts must more be broke, E're these afflicted Isles will repossesse A safe, a reall, and a lasting peace. Delude you not your selves, with guilefull showes; For, when they promise most, they most deceive. To win, is, manie times, the way to lose: And, Victories, of safety may bereave. Security, may lose you, in a day, What, watchfulnesse was gaining, many years; And, in a moment, GOD may take away Your greatest strength, when strongest it appears. Were now, your adversaries in your power; Were not a dog, to barke against you, left, And, Peace confirm'd; you might, within an houre, Of all that happinesse, be quite bereft. Yea, and it should be lost again, e're long, Vnlesse, on better tearmes, you made it strong. Vpon the justnesse of the Cause, some trust; But, that, a vain dependence may be found: For, if they, who defend it, be unjust, A righteous Cause, may fall unto the ground. The Jewes did flie before the Canaanites, While but one Achan, in their Camp, remain'd; They fell before the wicked Benjamites, While, their impenitencie they retain'd. Some think, because the Word of Truth, is here, GODS Ordinances, and his holy-things, That, you a priviledged people are: But, no securitie, at all, this brings: It, rather, calls for vengeance on that place, Which answers not, in fruits, their meanes of grace. The Arke, it selfe, from Israel, was borne, And, they who kept it, slaughtered, for their sin; Ev'n GODS own House was ra'zd, and made a scorne, And, they inthral'd, who served him therein. GOD, for his Temples sake, spar'd not oppressions, Nor, for that Worship which they did professe: But, them he turned out of their possessions, For acting sin, in cloakes of holinesse. Do you suppose, that, GOD, will for the sake Of those few righteous men, that, yet, remaine, The present troubles from these Islands take, And, settle all things here, in peace, again? How can you such a benefit expect, Till righteous men, you better do affect. If you, by them, such blessings may enjoy, Why are you not, to those, more faithfull friends? Why seek you to undo, or, to destroy Those men, on whom your weale so much depends? Though, for their sakes, you reap, at other times, Great benefit; and often are secur'd, From publike mischiefes; yet, there have been crimes, For which, this priviledge is not procur'd. Though Noah, Job, and Daniel, interceded At such a season, grace should not be showne: They should not get a pardon, when they pleaded, For anie soules offending, but their own. And, so it may be, for ought yet, you know, With everie unrepentant sinner, now. Some, of you, have a hope, as vain as this, Another way; for, manie men suppose To be secured, by the wickednesse, And crying sins, of their blasphemous Foes. But, Edom did Jerusalem suppresse, Although the former had transgressed more: The Saints, although their errors may be lesse, Are daily murther'd by the Scarlet-Whore. GODS Magazine, hath punishments enow, To seize on all at once, that him offend; He Scorpions hath for them, and Rods for you, And, both will scourge, if both do not amend. He, as he lifts, can make you whip each other; Or, spare the one, or, punish both together. Indeed, a Kingdomes laying-wast, hath bin, And, is sometimes, deferred for the sakes Of righteous men, inhabiting therein: But, that, but little for the safety makes, Of Individuall sinners. For, you see, They, by the Sword, are pick'd out everie day, Their habitations daily ruin'd be. And their posterities are swept away. Yea, when, quite round them, all the neighbourhood Stands unimpaired, they are somtime seized, That, others may observe it, for their good, Or, that GODS wrath may, thereby, be appeased: And, otherwhile, the just are taken from A wicked-place, to scape the plagues to come. But, what, or whom, need you suspect, or feare, Though both your Horse &amp; Foot, this day were routed? Of your own selves, you well-conceited are Of your own courses, nothing is mis-doubted. You have designes, wherein you can confide, Though GOD be verie little in your thought: You, in a blindfold hope, can quiet bide, Though, in due meanes, his aid you have not sought. You seem so knowing, that none must advise; So righteous, that, you reformation hate; So holy, that, your brethren you dispise, So powerfull, as if you preserv'd the State: And beare your selves, as if unto these Nations GOD, were oblig'd, by speciall obligations. And, if but with a superficiall look A view of you were taken, on that side Which fairest showes, you might be, then, mistook, For better then you'l prove, when you are tride. You are now frequent in humiliation, You are profest Reformers of your waies; You are become the longest-praying Nation, And, holiest-talking people, in these daies, Your simplest tradesmen are grown mighty Preachers, Your souldiers guifted are with double power, Young silliest women are admired teachers, And speak, and pray among you by the houre. The chiefest places in your Common-weale, Supplied are, with men of noted-zeale. The godly party, now preferments gets, (At least, they who the form thereof put on) And, when some of them, are prov'd counterfeits, The honest party will be thought upon. To keep the foremost-table of the LAW Inviolate, you care, of late, have took; And, many think, it showes you stand in awe Of GOD; and, that you at his honour look. And, peradventure, (if it hinder not Your lusts or profits) when you are at leasure, Some Orders or Provisions may be got, To make you carefull, in some better measure, To keep the second-Table: wherein, lies The proofe of your faire-seeming sanctities. You zealously have, likewise, overthrowne The monuments of Popish superstition; Pull'd Crosses, Images, and Altars down, Even those things that gave but just suspition Of an Idolatrous or fruitlesse use; As well appeareth, in not lettting passe (When you demolish'd them, for their abuse) The guilded Organs, and the painted glasse. You have for ev'rie week a Sabbath, now; For every moon a Fast; in private, more: Thanksgiving daies, you likewise do allow, For holy-daies, observed heretofore; Which, of those feasts, will well supply the room, Vntill you wearie of them shall become. These works are found among you, and of those Some part from upright-heartednesse doth flow, And from those rectified consciences, Which do a reall Reformation show. And, though the works themselves have no deserving In their own nature, or, through imperfections, Concomitant: yet, GOD, in you, observing A will renew'd, and following his direction, According to your power, accepteth so A fraile performance, from a weake intent, That, he as much, by Grace, imputes thereto, As if it perfectly were done, and meant. And (for a few thus qualifi'd) GOD hath Deferr'd full prosecution of his wrath. But, so far off, your Reformations, yet, And pious showes, are from deserving ought, Or from a likelihood, that they will fet The peace, for which, you have both pray'd and sought; That, if more mercies GOD vouchsafe not to you, Then by your Sanctitie deserved are, Your holy-things, would utterly undo you, Though all your other sins remitted were. For, as before their thrall, the wicked Jewes, Did act a seeming-sanctified part, Approaching near to GOD, in words, and shewes, Yet, kept themselves, far from him, in their heart: So, most of you have done: And, GOD therefore, Your Sabbaths, Fasts, and Praises doth abhorre. To him, your hands you lifted in a VOW; A serious Covenant, with him, you made, You made it also, not without a show, As if unfained purposes you had To do, as you profest: And, you have seem'd Not only to have rightly understood That League, and highly thereof to have deem'd, But, thereby, likewise you receiv'd much good. Yet, as if, with well-doing, tir'd you were, (Or, rather, as if you besotted grew) To tender it, you very little care, Or, thereunto, conformity to shew. A needlesse duty, this, by some, is thought, Or, pressed farther, then of right, it ought. But, if it hath impos'd unduly been, Why were two Realms, so unadvis'd, to make it? If righteo,us in your eyes, the same still seem, Why is not everie man requir'd to take it? If, necessarilie, it was injoyn'd, And lawfully, why should you suffer them Both libertie, and favour, too, to finde, Who, therein, shall your Ordinance contemn? Why, is there not a difference put 'twixt those Who take it; and all those who shall refuse it? And, punishment why do you not impose On them who take it, only, to abuse it? Since, breach of publike Cov'nants is a sin, Which, alwaies, brings a publike vengeance in. A Cov'nant broke, though with the Gibeonites, (Who gained it a surreptitious way) Brought down a Plague upon the Israelites, Which cost, the bloud of Princes, to allay. No branch of this, is anie way unjust, Or inconsistent, in the least degree, With anie dutie, which performe you must As Christians, or, as morall men you be; Nor is it (being understood aright) A barre to anie Christian-Libertie, Or, humane Priviledge; though, at first sight, To some, these, may appeare infring'd thereby: For, by that Covenant, you vow'd no more, Then, what you were obliged to before. It binds you no profession to imbrace Of Doctrine, Manners, or, of Discipline, Ought farther, then conformable it is Vnto the Canon of the Word-divine: You vowed nothing to reject, but what Shall prove, upon due triall, to be found Destructive, or repugnant unto that; Or, to the Bond, wherewith you should be bound: And, as you are obliged, by the same, To nothing, any way unwarrantable; So, likewise, you thereby, ingag'd became No further to performe, than you are able: Nor harme, thereby, to any can befall, But, praise to GOD, and safetie unto all. And, yet, this sacred Covenant, and VOW, Which tendeth to the prejudice of none, Which Law-divine, and humane doth allow, Which need constrain'd you to have undergone; Which was resolv'd on, by two prudent Nations, Which, by the highest Senates, in both Lands, Was made, and took, with due deliberations, And, sign'd with twentie hundred thousand hands. Those Vowes, which you have sealed with your bloud, Those Vowes, which in ten thousand Congregations Attested were; and which you call'd on GOD To witnesse too: These Vowes, and Protestations, Vow'd so religiously, and so attested, Regarded are, as if you had but jested. Who dream'd to see a VOW, cri'd up like that, Observ'd no better, than conditions made By Boyes, or Girles, at Push-pin, or at Cat? Who could have thought, that Christians should have had Of conscience, or of credit, so small care, As to forget, nay, so much to despise A Dutie, wherein so concern'd they are? And, whereupon, Life, State, and Honour lies? He that your Ordinances doth peruse, With your instructions, and marks what is done; Can find out nothing, whereby to excuse Your ill pursuit, of what you well begun. Or why, he should, till you reforme your wayes, Much heed, what such a Nation, doth, or sayes. For, both so negligent, and false are you, In what you vow'd: yea, both to GOD, and Man, So foolishly, so shamelesly untrue, Most have been, since this Covenant began: That (if you soon repent not) this one sin Will make a curelesse Breach: yea, this offence Will bring incurable-Destruction in, Without a speedy, and true penitence. Thus, that, which might have much advanc'd your peace, Is like, by your corruption, to procure, In stead of what you hope for, an encrease Of Plagues, and Troubles, longer to endure: Yet, this is not the only meanes of Grace, Which is, by you abused, in this place. Your Provocations are as much, or more, In other sacred things: For, though some few Have better out-sides, now, than heretofore, They are not really, the same they shew. The hewing out of Reformation makes Good chips; and, for each Carpenter, such Fees, That, whatsoever paines therein he takes, No feare of any outward losse, he sees. In setting up of publike Disciplines, There are Devices, to contrive it so, That men shall thereby act their owne Designes, And few perceive it, what they intend to do: For, underneath a cloke of outward-zeale, More projects are pursu'd, than they reveale. And, otherwhile, GOD bringeth so about His purpose, that, he makes men Instruments To plot it, work it, yea, to fight it out, Against the current of their owne intents. Sometime, the furious zeale of Hypocrites, Or wilfulnesse of Tyrants, by the wages Of Balaam, to his service he invites; And, them, against his enemies ingages. By these, he Superstition doth deface, Pulls down Idolatrie, and way doth make For them, to build his Church, up, in that place Who seek to do his will, for Conscience-sake. Yea, thus, he more then once or twice hath done, Where famous Reformations were begun. Thus Iehu, in a Fierie zeal, destroy'd Baals Idols, with his Prophets: and, for this, That Crown, which by his Master was enjoy'd, GOD, for a while, entail'd on him, and his. Thus likewise, in this Kingdom, your eighth Harrie Made way for that which he intended not: And, then, from manie a wealthy Monasterie Both Lands and goods, for his reward he got. Yea, manie others furthered that work Beneath whose outside zeale, much avarice, Much pride, with much hypocrisie, did lurk, And, manie another secret lust, and vice, For which, draweth near, the fatall day, Of rooting them, and all their seed away. Yet, their example makes not These times free From those corruptions: for, much dawbing, still, With an untemper'd mortar, you may see; And, with pretence of good, much doing-ill. Much show of Reformation, here, is made In civill-matters; ev'n by them, that steale, And suck the nourishment it should have had, From this distrest, and sickly Common-weale. Yea, where it is expected, that extortion Should most be punished; there, now, are fees Exacted, in the most extreme proportion: And, He, that everie secret action sees, Will, shortly, find out some among them, too, With whom, a Bribe, can more then conscience do. Yet, such as these (when they are in the Chaire Of Judgment, Equitie, Examination, Or set in some Committee) offer faire, In zealous language, toward Reformation; These look big on offenders; threaten vice, And make some honest men, who come before them, To take them for the birds of Paradise; And ready, for their Virtues to adore them. They grow familiar with your ablest Preachers; They hear them often (in appearance gladly) They thanke them, praise them, as most powerfull Teachers: They can bewaile the Times; look verie sadly, And seeme to be exceedingly affeard, When they the threatnings of the WORD have heard. Yet, when all this is done, they passe away, Through all these threatnings, and through all their fears, To prosecute their lusts, the selfe-same day, In which GODS wrath was thundered in their ears. Yea, thus they do, when vengeance on the Road Is marching towards them, and in their view; Thus brazen-fac'd, thus fearelesse of their GOD, And thus irrationall, themselves they shew. Their fasts and praises are but complements, With GOD and men, to furnish out their scœne, Or, serve to cover-over their intents: But, little to that purpose they should meane. What e're the Preacher or the Prophet saies, Resolv'd they are, to follow their own waies. The Times, which you have either for confessions Of sins, or publike mercies, set apart, Are solemnized with such dull expressions, As if they were perform'd without a heart. And, though your Fastings, as Kings Ahabs, had Some recompence obtain'd in outward things, In lieu of Outward-showes, that you have made; Yet, little reall fruit that dutie brings. You fast not from Oppression, Fraud, and Strife, Nor from your Avarice, and base-designes; You fast not, from a wicked course of life, Nor from those lusts, whereto your flesh inclines: Your heads, you, in the morning, humbly bow: And, look, e're night, with an imperious-brow. GOD cares not for your solemne Fasting-day, Except you come before him, more prepar'd: You meet, and grant the Preacher leave to say What he shall please; but, give it no regard. Once, in a Moone, what is it, to repaire Vnto the Church; and, there, sit out a meale? Sleep out, perhaps, a Sermon, or a Prai'r; And, then come home, and fill your bellies well? Or, what availeth it, to sigh, and groane, And, make a crabbed face, an houre or two; Or, whine out words, in some affected tone; Or, yawne out Lamentations, as some do? What will all this availe, if you depart With an unsanctifi'd dissembling heart? When, on the set Humiliation-dayes, Your well-affected Brethren fast, and mourn; When ev'ry Congregation weeps, and prayes, That, GOD, in mercie, might, to them, return: Some (as if in despight of that Decree, And, in contempt of GOD) dance, feast, and sing; Or, drinking healths, to their confusion, be, Who, for the Publike-weale, Peace-Offrings bring. And, many, who would seem to sacrifice A contrite-spirit, and a broken-heart, Come, loaded with so many vanities, That, back, unto their dwellings, they depart, Not onely, lesse accepted then before; But, more despised, and polluted more. It is not to be thought, GOD doth regard A Formall-habit, so you do appear With hearts reform'd, and with a soule prepar'd, His holy-Word obediently to hear. Yet, know, that he expects, when you professe A sorrow for your sins, you should put on That outward, and that inward humblenesse, By which, the dutie may be truly done. He doth expect, that, when you near shall draw Vnto his Throne, you should approach thereto With so much reverence, and filiall awe, That, to the same, you no dishonour do; Nor, make prophane Beholders, to contemne His Worship, by your meane esteem of him. For, some would scarce believe, you serv'd a GOD, Who hath a power to punish, or to save; Or, be perswaded, that you fear'd his rod, Or, that you need of his compassion have; If they observ'd, how cloath'd to him you come, Or, heeded your behaviours, in his sight, Or, saw you, after you returned home, And, what your conversations were, that night. For, many, of you, habited appeare Like those, which to the Revells are invited; And, not, as if you men of sorrow were, Or, with GOD's anger, or your sins, affrighted; But trim'd with toyes, which, at that time, and place, Shewes, either want of wit, or, want of grace. And, when you should appear, with looks compos'd, According to the service you pretend, Your thoughts, by your deportment, seem dispos'd, As if imployed to some other end. Your voice is more imperious, and more loud, Then, well befits a Fast: you laugh, and grin, And, often, have those looks, and gestures, show'd, Which fitter for a Theater have been, Then for a Temple, in a day of Fasting: Which, if GOD should, severely, look upon, Your dayes of mourning, would be everlasting; And, your afflictions never would be done: For, he would see (not without Indignation) You come, but, with a fain'd Humiliation. And, then, among those errours, and presumings, Which make your holy-things abhominable, (And, which you must repent) are your assumings Vnto your selves, what you are never able, Nor, warranted to practise. For, the Pride, Which hath begot this Boldnesse, doth bring on Those dreamings, and o're-weenings, which divide, Distract, and trouble you, as they have done. You, missing his true meaning, who hath said, You should be Priests, and Prophets to the LORD, From Truth, and Decencie, have lately strai'd; And, made your Pray'rs, and Preaching, so abhorr'd, That in the stead of what you have expected, Increase of Plagues, and Discords, is effected. And, some of you, this Ignorance hath brought To such presumption, that you vilifie That PRAYER, which by CHRIST himselfe was taught, And, turn'd Devotion into Blasphemie; You, have not only offered strange-fire, But, also, things uncleane: for, you present Your Lusts unto Him; and, those things require, Which, make Him with your offrings discontent, When, therefore, you present the Sacrifice Of Prayer, know, that as you are not bounded To Verball-Formes; so, you should not despise The Rule, whereon that dutie should be grounded; Lest that, which might of Blisse, a meanes have bin, A meanes become, of letting Curses in. Of GOD, they seeme not prudently conceited, Who think, that those Petitions he despiseth, Which his owne Spirit hath, for us, indited; And only likes of those, which man deviseth: Or, that, he will impute it as a Vice, If in those wants, which formerly you had, You shall present him one Petition twice, Or, oftner, though with true devotion made; Or, that, at all times, all men, should repaire Vnto his Trone, with suits extemporarie, Because, those few that have the gift of Pray'r, Can, quickly, to fit words, their meanings marrie: For, this is but a novell-imposition, Arising out of Pride, and Superstition. (As of Virginitie, long since was said) Let them to whom GOD gives the same receive it. But, let it not on any man be laid, To whom it hath not pleased him to give it. To speak in publike, Moses was lesse able Than Aaron; and, yet, GOD did him endow With kowledge, and with gifts more honourable; And, from his Holy-Spirit they did flow. The wisest heart, hath not the nimblest tongue: Nor is it, still, the Spirits inspiration, Whereby, so many preach, and pray so long: But, Memorie, upon premeditation, And, that, makes oft a fairer shew, in words, Than Grace, with gifts more sanctifi'd, affords. And, by this help of Nature, carnall men, Not only gain esteeme beyond their merit; And, Player-like, act parts, which, now and then Are, falsly, thought out-flowings of the Spirit: But, by this qualitie, have, also, brought Contempt on better men: and, oft, thereby, Into their simple hearers hearts, have wrought, In stead of Truth, bewitching heresie. Yet, this their Tongue-craft, now, hath such esteeme, That he, who to himselfe, assumeth not This gift, doth scarce to them a Christian seeme: And, therefore, many, now, the same have got, Who care not, though these offrings of the tongue Be wholly Non-sense, so they may be long, GOD values your Devotions, by their strength Of Faith; and by your pious inclination; And, not by that tautologie, or length, Which hath, of late, begun to be in fashion, It was a Pharisaicall-Tradition, Arising partly from hypocrisie, And, partly, from a Jewish superstition, Which fool'd their Feminine simplicitie, As it doth ours. And, therefore, though he seeme Almost a Reprobate, who dares reprove That custome, (which those men do most esteeme, Who, with their owne conceptions, are in love) Yet, many of them, as your Saviour said, Have only prated, when they thought they pray'd. Let, then, your Praying, and your Preaching, too, Be such, as may True-Pietie advance: And, not the work of your Destroyer, do, By pleasing Self-conceit, and Ignorance, In giving leave to ev'rie giddie braine, To preach what ever Fancie shall invent; And, heaps of those false-Teachers entertaine, Who bring you Tidings, which were never sent. A mysterie, I will to you unfold, Whereof, if you take heedfull observation, A glimmering-light, you shall, thereby, behold, To help promote both Peace, and Reformation; And, give some hint, whereby you may provide, Against those Errours, which do much divide. There were two SIMONS, in the primitive, And purer times, who typified that Which doth concerne you: For, you do derive Your Evill-being, and your Good-estate, From what they signifie. The Name imports In English, HEARING; and, these did fore-show, That, in the Church, from Hearers of two sorts, Great Schismes, and much Heresie would flow. From SIMON-PETER, which is in your tongue, Hearing-the-Rock, the Faithfull-Hearers came: From SIMON-MAGVS, all those Hearers sprung, Which were seduc'd, according to his Name: For, by Interpretation, 'tis as much With you, as if yee said, Hearing-the-Witch. As Simon-Peter, and the Sorcerer, Long since contended, whether of the two, Should get possession of the Peoples eare, Ev'n so those hearings, at this present, do. As Simon-Magus, untill Peter spoke, Had so bewitch'd the common-people, then, That, for the POW'R of GOD, they him mistook; So, Formall-hearing, now, bewitcheth men. So, it is idoliz'd: and, some have thought, When, formally, that Dutie they had paid, The Holy-Ghost might for the same be bought: But, as then, Peter of the money said, Their Hearing with them perish, who suppose, That, GOD his Graces, for such wares bestowes, You, of this itching, this bewitching Hearing, Have had Experiments: and, at this day, There are such bitter fruits therof appearing, That, you had need be watchfull: and, to pray, That, GOD would please, to sanctifie the eare, And, circumcise your hearts, that you may know, When, you the Witch, and when you Peter heare, That, you, in Grace, may edified grow. And, that this Information make you not Respectlesse of that Hearing, or that Preaching, Whereby, that Saving-knowledge may be got, Which no man hath, but by the Spirits teaching: And, that, you so may Heare, that GOD may blesse Hearing, with Faith, &amp; Faith with Truth-full-Peace. Take heed unto your Prayers, that they reach not Their length, that Widowes-houses do devoure; Take heed unto your Preachings, that, you preach not The Spirit weak; and raise a fleshly-power. Take heed in Giving thanks, you do not say, In heart, when GOD hath victories bestowne; That, of your Foes, his hand did thousands slay, And, that, there fell ten thousands by your owne. Vnto your Fasts, and your Humiliations, Take, likewise, heed, left by your negligences, Those Duties may be greater aggravations Of your, but, seeming-sorrow'd-for-Offences. And, take heed, lest hypocrisie may breed Obstructions in you, of due Taking-heed. If truly you desire a happie-Peace, Repent your false Repentance; and, in haste, Your suits, with true sinceritie addresse, Before the Day of mercie shall be past. Reforme your Publike Fasts; and let them show, Ev'n in the Out-ward-man, so truly sad, That, others may your inward-sorrow know, And, by the same, so sensible be made, Of what you feele; that it may make them find A change in their owne hearts; and, by that change, Become to pious dutie so inclin'd, That, them from Vanitie, it may estrange; And, ev'rie day, one, thus, draw on another To Penitence, till all repent together. To make this dutie further to extend, (And, grow more generall) you shall do well, Vnto your Adversaries to commend, (And unto those, who in your quarters dwell) This motion: That (since both of you professe One GOD) you might assemble on one day, To meet before his Presence, to confesse Your wickednesse; wide open, there, to lay Your Causes; And, for judgement, to referre Your selves to him. For, such an introduction, A meanes to draw you somwhat nearer were, And, to remove, it may be, some obstruction Which hinders Peace; or, els, to bring that, on, By which, your work, the sooner may be done. If, they that have the better Cause, think fit (With some such meek and pious invitations As they might frame) for this end, to admit That day, whereon their Foes humiliations Pretended are; it either shall allure Your Adversaries to that Penitence, Which will a speedy amity procure: Or, aggravate, so greatly their offence, That GOD shall quite reject them, as if they Refused your Appeal; or, to abide His Doome: and did intend some other way, Or, by some other Censor, to be tri'd: And, what event will thereupon ensue, It were a needlesse matter to fore-shew. When all are thus assembled, on one day, Or els, of all, so many as GOD's grace Shall make, therewith, content: (For, though it may To you, be somwhat, yet nor Time, nor Place, Are, in respect of Him, considerable) Yea, when you in his presence shall appeare To this effect (as he shall you inable) Fall down before him, with all meeknesse, there. Together then, with seriousnesse, begin The Fast anew. In true humiliations, Let all bewaile their errours, and their sin, Till, in their mournings, and their Lamentations, The famous mourning, equallize they shall Of Hadadrimmon in Megiddo Vale. Let, joyntly, People, State, and King, unite In penitence, as they in sinne have done. Themselves, let them, for all their sinnes, indite, (Their new and ancient sins) before GOD's Throne. And, forasmuch, as in this later-Age, And, in this place, he seemeth, as it were, To bring all things, again, upon the stage, Which, heretofore, in action, did appeare: (Yea, since they, who will heed it, may behold All that concernes th'Estates, or conversation Of Saints, or sinners, in GOD's Word fore-told, Epitomized in this Generation) Let not his warnings, both by Word, and Deed, Be frustrated, through want of taking-heed. Remember to bewaile your Gentilismes, Your Babylonish-whoredomes, heretofore, Your ancient-heresies, and moderne-Schismes, That, GOD, for these, may judge these Isles no more. Observe, and well observe it; that, because You govern'd lesse by Law, then by your will; That, GOD, almost, depriv'd you of those Lawes: And, that, because (your projects to fulfill, Or, to promote your carnall-Policies) Morality, and Piety, by you, Were made but stales: the worlds old-Heresies, And Heath'nish-manners, are sprung up anew, To interrupt, and marre the publike-Peace, For your dissembling, and unthankfulnesse. Remember, that, like Israel, you have spar'd The Canaanites, that should have been destroi'd: That, like rebellious Saul, you had regard To Agag, and forbidden spoiles enjoi'd. Remember, how you stagger'd off, and on, Betwixt the LORD, and Baal, in ancient-time, And, how farre, you, in later yeares, have gone To repollute these Islands, by that crime. Remember, that, like Judah, you have made Confed'racies, with such as are GOD's Foes; Though warnings, counsells, and commands you had To shun their friendships, who the Truth oppose: And, mindfull be, how you on them reli'd, Whom Egypt, and whom Ashur, typifi'd. Remember, that, you have, like Solomon, (Though you had his example to beware) Been carelesse, those Alliances to shun, Which, both pernitious, and forbidden were. For, all this Empire, guiltinesse contracted, As well, by heeding not, to have prevented What, by your Kings, and Peeres of State, was acted, As, in not having, yet, this sin repented. Repent, that, as in Judah, by her Kings, You have, by halves, reform'd Religion too: Call, therewithall, to mind, what fruit it brings, The work of GOD, with negligence, to do. And, humbled be, for ev'ry other sin, Whereof these Isles have, jointly, guilty bin. Let those three Parties, which have made, this day, These Islands wretched, by their great Transgressions, And, chas'd their Glory, and their Peace, away, Make, jointly, and asunder, their confessions: For, all have much offended, ev'n the best Are guiltie of enough, to have destroi'd The temporall well-being they possest, And, all their hopes of what may be enjoi'd. Let luke-warme Newters, those poore-spirited, Degenerated Britains, without heart, (Who, as ignobly, have demerited, As those, who persecute the guiltlesse part) Repent, and change their temper, out of hand, Lest they be justly spu'd out of the land. Let them, that are supposed best affected, And, who, the best approved Cause befriended, Examine, how their duties are neglected, How false they are, in what they have pretended; How faintly they the publike-Guard began; By what ill meanes, they their Good-Cause pursu'd; How little trust in GOD, how much in Man, (And in an outward aid) hath oft, been shew'd; How heedlesse, of their Covenant, they grow; How many of them sleight the Vow they took; How they inlarge, how they contract it, now; How wilfully, how frequently, 'tis broke; And, how the publike sorrow they prolong, By doing Piety, and Iustice wrong. Let your Malignant-partie (or, of them, So many as are, yet, not gone so farre, That they all timely warnings must contemne) Remember, of what crimes they guilty are. Let them consider that to have their will, Or, that ambitious humours they may feed, Or, that some other lust they may fulfill, How, they have made their Countrey smart and bleeed. Let them consider, that they have pursu'd Their tyrannies, in these unhappie wars, As if they meant a pattern to have shew'd, Of Rehoboam, and his Councellers; Or, how King Ahabs party went to fight At Ramoth-Gilead, as in GODS despight. Let ENGLAND mourn apart, for all those crimes, Which do pollute her at this present day; And, those committed in preceding times, That GOD may take his heavie hand away. Her ficklenesse, in faith, and in attire; Her great abuse of plenties, by excesse; Her persecutions, both by sword and fire, Of those who did the holy faith professe. Her wantonnizing with the meanes of Grace, Her thanklesnesse for that long Peace she had, Her sleighting it when she forewarned was Of that great breach, which GOD on her hath made. Yea, all her other sinnes let her lament: Let her, all Nationall-defaults repent. Let SCOTLAND mourn apart, and search, wherfore Her sinnes upon her face, and on her back, GOD, at this present, doth so deeply score, Now, when she doth of sin most conscience make. Let her examine, if she hath no End To seize on some advantage, for her owne; While, her distressed Sister to defend, She, piously, a readinesse hath shown. If she be guilty, of so base a thought, Let her repent it, e're GOD search it out: If she be cleare, Truth shall to light be brought; And, they who of her faithfulnesse, now, doubt, Shall praise her Children; if they have a care, Their lying, and their bragging to forbeare. Let IRELAND mourn apart; and, not, alone, For her late Trecheries, and for the guilt Which her inhumane Natives brought upon Their heads, for bloud of Innocents new-spilt; But, also, for the sinnes of all those Nations, Within her borders, who, for their oppressions Were cast out of their ancient-habitations; And, lately, driven from their new-possessions. Let her, that brutish Ignorance lament, Wherewith, she, many ages, was polluted; That Heath'nish-Christianity repent, Which, her blind Children, piety reputed; And, her Rebellions, and Idolatry, Let her bewaile, with true humility. Let her observe, what her Transgressions be; That She, unto the praise of GOD, may say; In all his judgements truly just is he, And, that, with Mercies, he did them allay. For, if a strict inquirie he had made, For all the Bloud, th'Oppression, and the Guile, Of which, he, Information might have had, There had not one been living in that Ile. Both Scot, and English, verie studious were, To plant themselves upon her fruitfull plaines; But, how, Religion might be planted there, They tooke but verie little care, or paines. To save the Soule, not many were employ'd, And, therefore, many Bodies, were destroy'd. Had her late Planters, as industrious bin, Her Natives, with Religion to enrich, As how to make themselves great men, therein, (Or, if their care had been but halfe so much) Some hundred thousands had, this day, possest Their lives, and livelihoods; who, at their cost, For times to come, Examples have increast Of goodly-hopes, through want of Prudence, lost. And, therefore, let them learne, who yet survive, Not to neglect CHRISTS Kingdome; if they would, Their Kingdome, or their Heritage should thrive; Or, that, their Hopes, or Labours prosper should. Yea, if they seek on Earth a firme possession, Let them not build their houses by oppression. For, not a few of her Inhabitants, Both out of England, and from Scotland came, Meane in esteeme; opprest with many wants; And, many of them, many wayes to blame; Some, with projections, nor discreet, nor just; Some, to defraud their Creditours, and Friends, Of their estates; some, to enjoy their lust, And, other some, for other such like ends, Came over to that Kingdome, nor much knowne, Nor much regarded; who, in little space, Were not alone exceeding wealthy growne, But, made both Earles, and Barons of the Place: And, they, who suddenly, aloft did clime, Were pulled to the ground in shorter time, They, whose abundance, over-night was more, Then they could value; e're the following day Disclos'd it selfe, were made exceeding poore; And, glad from all their wealth, to run away: Scarce leasure had they (left they lost their lives, With their estates) to take, of all they had, Enough, wherewith their children, and their wives, Might clothed be, when their escapes they made. The losse, the frights, the bloud-shed, and the cries, Felt, suffered, seen, and heard, in those black-nights, Present O Ireland, still, before thine eyes: Still, let thy children keep them in their sights. That Visitation, let them so bewaile, Especially, the sins that caused it, That, they, nor their posterity, may faile To mind the same; and, let them not forget To mourn apart, for that sad desolation, Nor to be thankfull, for their Preservation. Let every Corporation, Town, and City, Within these Islands also mourn apart; That, their Inhabitants may find more pity, Then may be challenged, by due desert. Some, of them, have the benefit enjoy'd Of GODS protections, both from fire, and sword: Some of them, have been touch'd, but not destroy'd, For which, what can they lesse then thanks afford? Let them acknowledge his preventing-Graces, Who, yet are safe; and, that, GOD pleas'd hath bin To keep Dstroyers from their dwelling places, So oft, so much polluted, by their sin: And, let all those whom he began to smite, Be thankfull, that, they were not ruin'd quite. For, great are those oppressions, which, of late, Have cri'd for vengeance, on some Governours, Of Mysteries, and Townes-incorporate, Who have abused both their Trust and Powers. Those Priviledges, which to them were deign'd, With chiefe respect unto the Common-good, Are oft insisted on (yea, and maintain'd) As if their Granter should be understood, To meane some favours to particular Places, With damage to the Publike; which, makes void His CHARTERS, ipso facto: For, such Graces Are by their owne excessivenesse destroi'd, If Reason may be Judge; which, heretofore, The greatest sway, in humane Actions, bore. Yet, you have Cities, Townes, and Mysteries, Which do not only, by such Grants, as these, Oppresse the Publike, without Remedies; And, injure Strangers, by their Franchises: But, also by mis-usage of their Grants, And, by their Pow'r do many times oppresse The poorest of their owne Inhabitants; Enslaving them, by wrongs, without redresse, For, of those profits, which conferred were (As well their needy members to sustaine, As, decently, that port and charge to beare, Which, to those Corporations do pertaine) Most part is swallowed, by a private purse; Or, spent in Feastings, which is somewhat worse. And, when so bad a Corporation growes, As to oppresse a Stranger, or their owne, He, that their tyranny then, undergoes, Is irrecoverably overthrowne, For, to a Body-politike belongs No Soule: And, if no Soule, what Conscience, then? And, if no Conscience, how can it, of wrongs Be sensible? when it had wronged men? It doth consist of many, and can raise The larger Bribe; the sooner find a friend; Or, search out, by what persons, or what wayes, It may (him whom it prosecutes) offend: And, which is worst (when other enemies, Time, slaies;) This, is a Foe that never dies. Let, therefore, all your Bodies-Politike Lament their sins apart, lest GOD destroy Those Priviledges, which, without desert, And, to the wrong of others, they enjoy. Among the rest, let ev'rie Academ, Lament apart, till they, are purged from Their great corruptions, lest, from out of them, Your bane, as from a poison'd Fountaine come: For, their pollutions one maine cause have bin, Of all your present mischiefes: yea, from thence Proceeded not alone much of that sin, Which hath defil'd these Isles; But, that offence, And, those divisions, also, which of late, Have almost ruined both Church, and State. For, there, through want of prudent Government; Good principles, and pious education, Your youth, which were, for knowledge, thither sent, Lost civill manners, wit, and reputation. Thence was it, that your Clergie-men became Such Roarers, and such Tosse-pots, as they were. Their Life, and Doctrine, growne so much to blame, Was first corrupted, and perverted there. There, they were taught to fawne, and flatter, well, For their preferment; and, how to become Fit Priests for Ahab, Baal, and Jezabel: Or, Pimps, and Panders, for the Whore of Rome. GOD grant, that for their sins, they so may mourne, That, they to GOD; and, GOD, to them may turne. Let your Assembly of Divines, apart, Repent and mourne; themselves, examining, What aimes, what hopes, what purposes, what heart, And, what desires, they to their meetings, bring. Let them consider, whether, none advances Traditions of their owne, to be received, And to be practis'd, as Gods Ordinances; Which are, in truth, not such to be believed. Let them examine, whether they do carrie A due respect to Christian-Liberty, If they inforce those things, as necessary, Of which there is no true necessity; And, whether, they have not removed hence, What, might have edifi'd, without offence. Let it be heeded whether they have care, As CHRIST himselfe, and, his Apostles had, What things the people, and the times, can beare, E're they impose them; lest, they make them mad, Instead of right reforming. Let them trie, Their spirits well, and search, if there be none Who dare pretend divine Authority For that, which GOD commands, not to be done. Let search be made, if any Discipline Hath been projected, for a private end, Or, to advance a politike Designe, Which needlesly, weak Christians might offend; Or, which may causlesse jealousies increase, Inlarge your troubles, or deferre your Peace. Let all their Brethren of the Clergie, too, In every Faction, seriously repent, And mourn apart; This, let them chiefly do, Who look'd one way, while they another went. Let them consider, whether they pretend not Great diligence, and zeale, to bring to passe That just, and pious work, which they intend not So much, as that, which therewith cover'd was; Let them examine, also, if the while They cozen others, others will not seek, With falshoods, their Deceivers to beguile, And, to requite their practice, with the like, Till all these Kingdoms, and these Churches, rue The pathes and vanities, which they pursue. For, as they had designes upon the State, Their aimes to further; so have others had Designes on them, whereby they have, of late, To wicked purposes, advantage made. Some, to the Presbyterian-side adhere, Some to your Independents: But, with those, Who, busiest, in partaking, do appeare, Another Faction, secretly, doth close, Which parts it selfe among them, and, thereby, Spies out the strength, and weaknesses of either; Foments their quarrellings, and, doth comply, As friend to one side, yet, is true to neither; But, covertly, by means of those two Factions, Increaseth publike dangers, and distractions. These, by this craft, have made the zeale of those, On either side, whose purposes are good, The Kingdomes peace, unheeded, to oppose, With such, as, openly, the same withstood. So that, if Envie, Avarice, and Pride, Whence sprung that Aconite, that Clergie-bane, Which hath your Clergie, lately, giddifi'd, Shall not, by penitence, away be tane, Your quarrells will perpetuated be; And, neither Church, nor State, nor Corporation, Nor Families, be from divisions free. Now, therefore, in a true humiliation, Let ev'ry one of them, prepare his heart, For his transgressions, to lament apart. Your Militarie-Men, apart, must mourne, Aswell as these. And, therefore, that, they may, With true compunction, from their wayes returne; Let them, to heart, their many failings lay. Let your Commanders mourne, for all those harmes, Which have been suffred, under their Commands, By their neglecting of that Law of Armes, Whereon, the honour of a Souldier stands. Let them bewaile the plunders, rapes, and murthers, The Breaches of Lawes-morall, and Divine, The violences, riots, and disorders Committed through default of Discipline: And, for their Avarice, and their Ambition, Whereby, they do prolong your sad condition. Let them not thinke, that none so worthie are To be advis'd withall, (or of esteeme) For Souldiery, as they that boast, and sweare, Or arrogate to be, what they, but seem. Let them not think, they better may confide In Officers, who have not so much braine To keep their legs from staggering aside, Then in a Souldier of a sober-straine. Or, that this War had e're the worse went on, Had all been countenanc'd in their Command, Who, for the worke-sake, ventur'd thereupon; And did, aswell as others, understand The moderne-Discipline, and, therewith, too, Knew what the Greeks, and Romans use to do. Let them repent their treacherous complying With your professed foes; their favour-showing To men suspected; and their grace-denying, Where better trust, and more respect was owing. Let them be sorrie, that the faithfulnesse, Or, at the least, the prudence, which they wanted, Made publike charge, and dangers to increase By Passes, and Protections, lightly granted. And, let their hearts of adamant, and steel, Be prick'd with such remorse, and penitence, That, in themselves, a loathing they may feel Of their inhumane spoiles, and insolence Committed in that Countrey, which hath bred them; And, on their friends, who payed, arm'd, &amp; fed them. Moreover, let the Gentrie of the land Bewaile their many vanities, apart; The duties of their calling understand, And lay their many failings more to heart. For, most have liv'd, as if to idlenesse, And to debaucherie they had been borne, And large estates, for nothing, did possesse, But, for supplies of lust, to serve their turn. A die, a cocke, a hound, hawke, horse, or whore, Were chiefest objects of their contemplation: Their sinnes alone, are, though you had no more, Enough to bring a Land to desolation: And, they have been chiefe cause, and instruments Of all these Plagues, for which this Realme laments. But, much will want of perfecting a peace, Vntill your Men of Law perswaded be To mourn apart. For, they will re-increase Your quarrells, else, as soon as you agree. By their formalities, and slow proceeding, Your remedie, for injuries is made A mischiefe, the disease, oft times, exceeding: And, if some eye, unto them, be not had, So many places in your Parliament They will supply, and fill so many Chaires In your Committees; that, much derriment Vnto the Subject; and some close impaires Of publike freedomes, (e're you be aware) Which slip upon you, if you have not care. They have, already, made the common way Of Trialls, very greatly, to inlarge Your troubles, by impertinent delay, And circumstances, to the suiters charge. So strong a party they have alwaies had, That your Great-Charter, which doth interdict Delay of Justice, was, in that point, made (E're since the grant) a Law without effect. But when their Courts, and practises have reach'd Oppressions height; They, as the Clergie were, Shall downe, into another Orb, be fetch'd, And taught to keep a constant motion there. This Work, upon some Courts, hath been begun; Another time, it shall be fully done. Let ev'rie Oiconomick-Government, And ev'rie single person, through the Nation, In ev'rie Family, apart lament, And take his wayes into examination. For, all Estates and Common-weals, that be, Consist of these: And, whensoe're you shall Those Pettie-Governments reformed see, You, then, are in the way, of mending all. If ev'rie Houshold-Prince, and Officer, Within his Jurisdiction, would but please, To make compleat a Reformation, there, The Work-desired, should be done with ease. Let each one, therefore, take the same in hand, In all relations, wherein he may stand. Let ev'rie Master, prudently direct; And, ev'rie Servant, faithfully obey: Let ev'rie Husband, husband-like affect, And, ev'rie Wife, a wife-like love repay. Let Parents, parent-like, their hearts enlarge, Their filiall duties, let the Children do; Let, singly, all of these their parts discharge, Both to the Family, and Strangers, too. Yea, let each person, individually, Now, take himselfe, apart, and, all alone, His heart examine, what Impietie, By him, hath been occasioned, or done, Whereby your Peace was broke; and, then assay, To help renew it, by what means he may. But, chiefly, let the Royall-Family Admit this Discipline, that others may Receive encouragement, and light, thereby, To find a Penitentiarie-way. Oh! let the King, if ever he expect, To see the Citie of his Throne, in peace, Go mourne apart; and, let his thoughts reflect Vpon his folly, and unrighteousnesse. Let him like David, (and not Ahab-like) Take meekly those reproofs, that GOD shall send, And, let them on his heart so kindly strike, That, he enraged grow not, but amend. With that great Patterne, of true Penitence. When he, like sheep, beholds his people slaine; Let him not look, too much, on their offence, But, rather, let him of his own complaine: That, they may do the like; and, GOD perceiving True penitence, quit both, by free forgiving. Let not the Jezabel of Rome delude him, With her black witch-crafts, and her fornications, Lest, out of all his Kingdomes she extrude him, And, make him cursed, thtough all generations; For, of all Kings on earth, who now shall drink The cup of her delusions; if in vaine His warnings prove, the deepest he shall sink, Into that Lake, whence none can rise againe. Because, he hath not only had a sight (Beyond them all) of her seducing waies; But, also, hath acknowledged that Light, And, wilfully, himselfe to her betraies: Yea, and to make his sin, and shame the more, Betraies the bloud of others, to the Whore. Yet, that he may have all the meanes to fetch him Back from perdition (if he be not gone So far, by wilfulnesse, that none can reach him) Let him be personally call'd upon, To look unto his waies. And, since you know, His Flatterers, present him their false glasse, Himselfe, thereby, unto himself, to show, And make him seeme the man he never was; Help thou to undeceive him; lest he may, With his three earthly Kingdomes (now halfe lost) Fool desp'rately, a heav'nly Crown away; And, think, he shall redeem it, at the cost Of trimming up the Western end of PAVLS, By Fines, extracted from afflicted Soules. First, bid him call to mind (with mourning for them) The sins which did his Fathers-house pollute; And, in his heart, so seriously, abhor them, That, it may bring forth penitentiall fruit. The bloud of War that hath in Peace been shed; The manifold uncleannesses therein; The superstitions, thereby, cherished; Offences known, and those that hid have bin: The prosecution of the royall-bloud In Arabella; (guilty of no crime, Except it were offensive, to be good, And, to have had her being, in his time.) The matchlesse prophanation of a Day For Gowries death: his many great oppressions; The fooling of the Kingdomes wealth away, And Subjects lives, by cheating Expeditions: With whatsoe're offences, of this kind, He shall, upon a strict enquirie, find. Wish him, with like affections, to recall The slips of his own Reigne, and of his life; The mischiefs, which to Him, and you, befall, In hunting for a superstitious Wife: His making of Nobility a scorne, By dignifying men of base-condition; By choosing Counsellours, to serve his turne, In setling things, unworthy his fruition. By suffring of his royall Proclamations To be abused to injurious ends; By making showes of verball Reformations, For publike good, when rapine he intends. By faining fears, when cause of feare, none give him; And, by protesting, untill few believe him. Let Him consider, that, all those, for whom Against two Kingdoms, he, in Armes, appears, And, whose Protector He is now become, Are men, whom nothing, but their sin, endears. Let Him consider, what a sea of bloud, In his three Kingdomes, hath, of late, been spilt, For those, who share among them all his good, And, make him culpable of all their guilt. Let him consider, that, what, now, he strives, And fights for, is, but, power to be undone; Or, that he may, by his Prerogatives, Without controule, unto the Devill run: For, unto him, that power, or that supply Which may be for his good, none shall deny. Let him remember, what the German-horse Should have been sent for: Let him call to minde Distressed Rochel: And, that, which will worse Afflict him, when his feeling he shall finde, Poore gasping Ireland; whose wide-gaping wound Calls out for vengeance, and, his honour taints With deep-di'd staines. His flat'rers feigne a sound From Straffords bloud, and other such black-Saints; But, that Illusion will not keep him long From hearing Ireland: For, two Kingdomes more Have sent in bloud, to make a triple-Song; Which, will, so dreadfully, so loudly roare, That, he shall heare (unlesse repent he do) Ere long; and heare it, with a vengeance, too. Let him repent, his having, long, attempted His loving-people, to inslave, and grieve: For, he from vengeance will not be exempted, By pleading an usurp'd Prerogative. Let him repent, the cov'ring his intents With Protestations, and religious showes: Since, these are made such thred-bare complements, That, ev'ry one, almost, their meaning knowes: Nor let him longer foole himselfe, to think, The World perceives not, what his projects be: For, he is blinde, or, wilfully, doth wink, Who cannot, at a hundred loop-holes see, That, many yeares, before this war begun, He purposed the course, he, now, doth run. Then, that he may, without despairing, heare, Let him, with penitence, before it comes, To all those wholsome Counsels lend an eare, Which, timely, may prevent ensuing doomes. To mollifie his heart, let him present Before his understanding, and his eye, How spoiled, and how miserably rent His three late-happy-Kingdomes, now, do lie. Let him give eare unto those just complaints Which his distressed Subjects have prefer'd; Let him regard the suffrings of the Saints; Let living-moanes, or, dying-groanes, be heard: The Widdowes prayer, and, the Orphans cries, Lest, GOD, to hear him, in distresse, denies. Let him remember, that, they, who complain, And, of whose Townes, he, now, doth ashes make, Are those, who, for his safe return from Spaine, Made joyfull-Feasts, and Bonfires, for his sake. Let him consider, that, these are the Nations, (Ev'n these, whom, now, he tramples under-feet,) Who him received with glad acclamations, And him did, oft, with love-expressions, meet. Let him consider, that, they, who enjoy His presence, now, are those that prey upon him; Ev'n some of those, who lab'red to destroy His Fathers house; and, those that have undone him, Both in his reputation, and, estate; And, merit not his favour, but his hate. Let him take notice, that, by his digression From prudent Counsells, his most cruell Foes Have so imprison'd him in their possession, That, of himselfe, he cannot, now, dispose. And, since, all Europe knowes it, let him know, That, though they flatter, and, upon him fawne, He, despicable, in their eyes, doth grow; And, is, by them, esteem'd but as a pawne. Yea, let him also know, that, he hath got So little credit, upon either side, That, as the Parliament, now, trusts him not, So, but few other much in him confide. Nor will his lost repute, to him return, Till, for his errours, he shall truly mourn. Let him consider, that, whereas he sought To multiplie wild-beasts, within his land, That, GOD, in justice, now, the same hath brought Almost into a Desart, to his hand. To nourish Beasts, his Huntsmen took away His peoples birth-right: And, behold, now, he Is, therefore, hunted, like those Beasts of Prey, By which, the neighb'ring towns molested be. When he was in his artificiall-heav'n, Which flatring Poets, and his Painters made, Let him re-minde, what Attributes were given; With what high Epithetes, they made him glad; What joy, in vanities, he, then, did take; And, what a GOD of him, his Priests did make. Let him take notice, that, there was a doubt, His Father came not, fairly, to his end; And, that, when meanes was made to search it out, And, Witnesses commanded to attend, The Parliament, abruptly, up was broken; And, no proceeding, afterward, therein. Let him consider, what this may betoken, What jealousies, it, justly, might let in. If any were suspected, without cause, Their Innocence, by triall, had been clear'd: If justly tax'd; why had not, then, the Lawes Their course? why was not that accuser heard? Cleare, or not cleare, somebody was to blame, That, such an accusation quasht became. Nay, these three Kingdomes did neglect, in this, A dutie, which they, questionlesse, did owe: And, partly, for that negligence it is, That, GOD, for bloud, doth make enquirie, now. For, of each Subject of the mean'st respect, Ev'n of the Beggar, by the high-way side, The King hath an accompt, upon suspect, That, by the hand of violence he di'd. And, should a King, that, living, had protected So many millions, dying, so be sleighted, That, when he to be murther'd was suspected, Not one should be examin'd or indited? Believe it, this Neglect is, now, rewarded: For, thousands die, and perish, unregarded. In all three Kingdoms, was there never a one To second, the Physitians, Eglesham And Ramsey? had he not a powerfull Son? And his Beloved servant, Buckingham? Were there not some about him, who then had No hopes, but those which on his life were laid: Had he not Lords, and Earles enough, then, made, Who, by this dutie, might have partly paid For his respects? Could none of all those things Call'd Bishops, upon whom in life he doted; Whom he esteem'd the Angell-guard of Kings, Whom he, out of the dung-hill, had promoted, To sit with Princes? could of all these, none Repute him worth regard, when he was gone? Let him remember, and consider well, What judgements, have, on that neglect, ensu'd; How suddenly, the Duke, soon after, fell; What direfull vengeance hath this Land pursu'd Ev'n to this day: and know, there is a GOD, Who (though Kings do neglect it, or, assay To hide it) will be searching after bloud; And, all concealed mischiefs open lay. This, let him do; lest, he, that might have worn The glorious'st Christian Wreath, ere long, become To be abroad, a laughing-stock, and scorn, And, past regaining honour, here, at home. For, yet, he may return; and, if he do, He shall recover all his Honour, too. There is a way (if he will seek to finde it) To greatest Honours, thorow this Disgrace: There is a meanes (if he will, truly, minde it) By which, this wonder may be brought to passe. To no worse end, this VOICE doth, now, discover His failings, but, to drive him to this course. To no worse purpose is he, thus blackt over, But, that, he might not be defiled worse. And, this VOICE prophesies, that, if he shall With upright-heartednesse, pursue that Path, He shall not onely be restor'd to all His honours lost, and be redeem'd from wrath, But, also, farre more honourable grow, Then all the Kings of Europe, raigning now. Belief works greater wonders; let him, then, Believe it may be, and, it shall be done. He hath, too much, believed many men, Whose Word was lesse to be reli'd upon. The precious'st Pearles lie deepest in the Seas, The richest stones from hardest rocks are hew'd, The darkest mornings have prov'd glorious dayes, Great mercies to great Sinners, have been shew'd. When, to repentance, GOD was pleas'd to call Manasseh, few were better Kings then he: When he converted persecuting Saul, A glorious change, in him, the Church did see; And, so there may be, now: For, who can tell, But, that, to make you rise, your Sov'raigne fell? If he suppose, that, he may find evasions From any thing, against him, here, exprest; Yet, of offences, since he gave occasions, Let him not, in his own uprightnesse, rest: But, since GOD, both with Scandalls, and the Sword, Pursues him at the heeles, let him repent. Let him indeavour, in a true accord, To meet him in his lawfull Parliament: For, if, with humblenesse, he can submit To GOD's corrections, he will, soon, forgive him: He hath another blessing, for him, yet; He, unto favour, will, again receive him: And, when his Sov'raigne shall, thus highly grace him, With their old love, his Subjects shall imbrace him. But, ere this reconcilement can be had, His Parliament, reform'd must, also, be; And, their Attonement, must, with GOD be made: For, him they have provok'd, as well as he. And, though the better Cause their partie hath, And, prosecutes it, stoutly, now and then, Their failings, also, have deserved wrath; And, many of them, are no better men. The greatest Counsells, in the world, may erre In Judgment, and in Fact: For, they consist Of many men, among whom, some there are, Who do not what they should, but, what they list. And, such, have, in your choice Assemblies, bin Occasions of much errour, and, much sin. Then, let the Bodies-Representative Of these three Kingdomes; but especially, Thy Parliament, O ENGLAND, now, receive This summons to a true humility. Let ev'rie Individuall Member, there, Lament apart. Let him, both as a Man, And, as he qualified, doth appeare, For publike service, do the best he can, To purge out, by an humble penitence, What guilt soever, he, by wilfulnesse, Or weaknesse, hath incurred, ever since A place in that High-Court, he did possesse: And, let him not disdaine, who ere he be, To take this counsell, though it come by thee. Remember him, if he be of the Peers, The dutie of his Peerage: For, betweene The Sov'raigne-Person, and the Commoners, He standeth, as an Honourable Meane, The Body-Politike, to temper so, That, ev'rie Part, and Member, of the same, May, to that due, and faire proportion grow, Which will be most convenient for the same. For, while they keep their Station; and so long, As, in the Three-Estates, there is retain'd A comely Symetrie; there can no wrong, By either, from the other, be sustain'd: Nor, can all humane policie invent, A nobler, or a safer Government. But, if those Parts encroach upon each other, Or, act to other purposes, than those, For which they were ordain'd, they'll fall together, Into that Chaos, from which first they rose. If therefore any Peere, through some distrust Of others, or corruption of his owne, Hath any way been failing, in that Trust, Which GOD, by birth-right, hath on him bestowne; Or, if for his advantage, he hath sought, To gaine a pow'r, or priviledge, whereby A dammage, on the Publike, may be brought; Let him repent him, of that injurie; Lest else GODS justice, and the Peoples wrath, Teare from him, that poore honour which he hath. Bid them not think, that their Immunities, And their large Priviledges granted were, That, they the common people might despise; And, wrong that pow'r, with which they trusted are. Bid them take heed, they do not so comply, To help enlarge an uncontrolled Pow'r, That, they at last, enable Tyranny, The Lords, as well as Commons, to devour. For, by that meanes, they shall not only bring The Commons into bondage; But, make way For him, that is a tyrannizing-King, Their honours, also, in the dust to lay; And, to advance those Vndeserving-Groomes, That, shall out-brave them, and possesse their roomes. Is't not enough, that some of them, of late, Were lifted to their Station, from among The Commons, for their falshood to the State? And doing Innocence, and Vertue wrong? For, some of them, at this day, had not won The honour of a Lordship, had they not, With stoutnesse, for the Common-wealth, begun; And, by betraying it, their Titles got. Is't not enough, that, by such meanes as these, They have attained to that high degree, Those Freedomes, and those Princely Priviledges, Which due unto the noblest Virtues be; Vnlesse, now they are up, it seemeth meet, To let them tread the Kingdome, under feet? Is't not sufficient, that nigh fortie yeeres, Most Honours, prostituted did become To sale? and, that so many of your Peeres Have raised been, out of the verie scum Of all mankind? Can they not be content, With what they have acquir'd, to go away? While they are wink'd at, cannot they repent? That, what they have, they may, in peace, enjoy? But, will they, still, endeavour to oppresse, And, to encroach upon the publike right? Vntill the People, stirr'd with furiousnesse, Deprive them of their May-game-Honours quite? Let them, with wisdome, rather be content, To save what they have gotten, and repent. For those exorbitancies, let them mourn, Whereby they have irregularly mov'd. Let them, with meeknesse, now, to GOD return, And not be mad, because they are reprov'd: Lest, if this VOICE displease them, they enforce, E're long, the sending of a Messenger, Which will afflict them, and enrage them worse, Than he, whom at this present, they shall heare. Let them, their Persons, and their Families, Hereafter, with that vertuousnesse ennoble, Which getteth favour in good peoples eies; And, spite of envie, makes their honours double: So, they a reall-Honour will possesse; And, none shall thrive, who seeks to make it lesse. Let ev'rie Member of the Commons-House, For his Transgressions, also, mourne apart. Let him, in secret, by himselfe, peruse The thoughts, and inclinations of his heart. Let him examine, how he first came in, To be of that Great-Councell: whether he Was not begotten, and conceiv'd in sin, A Member of this Parlament to be. And, if it hath been so; then, all alone, Let him that Crime-Originall repent; And, all that he hath actually mis-done, Since he hath sitten in this Parlament: For, till these be repented, all the fruit Of his endeavours, will be like the Root. As, he were verie foolish, who supposes, Were he but Brambles, or but Nettles planted, To gather Tulips, Violets, and Roses; So, out of question, they no folly wanted, Who could conceive, that Burgesse, or, that Knight, Whom, first, corruption chose (and who still dotes On that which gave him power) can be right, To Pietie, or Justice, in his Votes. Let him search, whether that strict Oath he took, At his Admittance, and the VOW, since made, Hath not been either negligently broke, Or, wilfully, some violation had: And, if he find it so, let him condole His failings, with repentance, and be whole. If he hath more pursued his owne ends, Than publike services: If he hath striven For feare, for gaine, or for respect of Friends, That, an injurious censure should be given: If he hath found himselfe, since his Election, Puft up with that intollerable pride, Or, that opinion of his owne perfection, Which is in some of them, with scorne, espi'd: If he hath, by his Pow'r, or by his Place, Occasion took, on absent men, to throw Aspersions undeserv'd, to their disgrace; Or, damage, e're themselves they wrong'd could know; Let him be sorrie for his impudence, And, seek to make amends, for that offence. If he hath injur'd any, by delay; Or, by unfit advantages, or times, Procured Votes, a surreptitious way; Or justified sinners in their crimes: If he hath crossed Vertues due reward, By plotting, packing, siding, or partaking; By hiding that, which ought to be declar'd, By cowardly, an honest Cause, forsaking: If, he hath under blame, or censure, brought Those innocents, who, meerly, out of zeale Vnto the Publike, have, sincerely, sought His folly, or his falshood, to reveale; And knew it true, (although their proofes did faile;) Let him, his cruelty, in that, bewaile. And, let your Parliament take speciall care Of this abuse; lest, els, a ground be lai'd, Whereon, their cunning foes may engines reare, Whereby, they may be wrong'd, if not betrai'd. For, though in justice they should vindicate The honour of their Members, whensoever Rash levitie, malignancie, or hate, To injure or asperse them, shall endeavour; Yet, when good probabilities, induce The well-affected, to mistrust, or feare, Some publike dammage, danger, or abuse, By that, which they shall either see, or heare, By any Member, either done, or said; Why should it not, unto his charge be laid? If, where, it ought, a secret be reveal'd; If, for the publike, without private spleen; If, past due time, it hath not been conceal'd; If, probabilitie thereof hath been; If, he that speaks it, be no way defam'd, And, of concernment if the same appears, Why should the speaker, be reprov'd or blam'd, For thus disclosing, what he thinks, or hears? If it be false, th'accused, need not feare it; For, if he be not otherwaies suspected, None, without proof, unto his wrong, will heare it. And, if he blamelesse be, and well affected, The zeal of his accuser, hee'l commend; And, count him his, because, the Kingdoms friend. Your Senators, their priviledges have, Not for their own, but for the publike sake; And, they abuse the trust their Countrey gave, Who, any further use, of them shall make. And, who can judge it reasonable, then, To make the people more afraid to wrong The priviledges, of your Single-men, Then those, which to the Commonwealth belong? Were it not fitter, to adventure on Dishonouring a Commoner, or Peer, Then suffer all of them to be undone, Through want of speaking that which you shall hear? Let them, who Freedoms-personall would cherish, To publike dammage; with their freedoms, perish. This way, the Royallists did first begin To screw up their Prerogative, to that, Which, made it more indulgent to have bin, To serve their turnes, then to secure the State. And, if there be not still a prudent care That, Priviledges clash not; and, that they Which are subordinate, may not appeare In force, untill their Betters, give them way; Destruction will succeed. Let, therefore, so Each Member, on his Priviledge insist. That, both by claime and practice, he may show, They are not to be used, as men list; Or, turned into Bug-bears, to affright The Common-wealth, from claiming of her right. Let, therefore, care be took, and, quickly too, That, her due rights the Common-wealth enjoy; That, private men their duties better do; And, that, divisions do not all destroy. Let not those foolish Toyes, who do besot Themselves, with arrogance, presume to prate, As if a Parliament had them begot, To be the heires-apparent to the State. Permit you not Religious-Melancholy, Phlegmatick-Av'rice, or, Zeale-Cholerick, Nor an excessivenesse of Sanguime-Folly, To make both Church and State grow deadly sick, Nay, rather mad; and, in their mad distractions, To teare themselves, into a thousand fractions. Let not your King and Parliament, in One, Much lesse apart, mistake themselves, for that, Which is most worthy to be thought upon: Or, think, they are essentially, the STATE; Let them not fancie, that, th'Authority And Priviledges upon them bestown, Conferred, to set up a Majesty, A Power, or a Glory, of their own. But, let them know, 'twas for another thing, Which they but represent; and, which, ere long, Them, to a strict account, will, doubtlesse, bring, If any way, they do it wilfull wrong: For, that, indeed, is, really, the Face, Whereof, they are the shadow, in the glasse. Moreover, thus informe them, that, if either, They, still, divided, grow from bad, to worse; Or, (without penitence unite together) And, by their sin, provoke him to that course; GOD, out of their confusions, can, and will Create a cure; and, raise a lawfull-power, His promise to his people to fulfill; And, his, and their Opposers, to devour. Yea, bid both King, and Parliament, make hast, In penitence, united, to appeare: Lest, into those Confusions, they be cast, Which will affright them both; and, make them feare, And, know, there is, on earth, a greater-thing, Then, an unrighteous Parliament, or King. More might be said; but, that which is behinde, Requires another season: Thou, therefore, Another opportunity must finde, If, thou desir'st to be informed more. Perhaps, thou hast, already, more exprest, Then many will approve, if thou reveale it: Yet, if thou look for any temp'rall-rest; Let hopes, nor fears, compell thee to conceal it. Thy Scorners, in derision, lately, said, Thou art a Prophet; but, when all is told Which is behind, their pride will be afraid, That, some ensuing things, thou didst behold; And, that, what e're thou art, thou hast declar'd Those Councells, whereof notice should be took; Those warnings, which are worthy of regard; And, like a true-man, and a free-man spoke. Let it be therefore, spoken, without fear: And, Let him, that hath eares to hear it, hear. The VOICE here, left to speake; and, here, will I For this time, leave to write; and, sit, and mourn For Britains, and mine own iniquity, Vntill, that VOICE, with perfect Peace, return. O GOD! returne it, quickly; and, let not This portion of it, be divulg'd in vain; Or, so despised be, or so forgot, That, Words of Peace, we never heare again. Speak Peace, how ever, to thy Servants heart; Speak to his Soul, in grace and mercy, LORD! That, from thy wayes, he never may depart; Or, dis-obedient be unto thy Word. Forgive him, all the vanities, that lurke Within his heart; All deeds, by him, misdone, And every word, and thought, whereby this worke Defil'd hath been, since, first, it was begun. Of outward-mercies, and, of some more ease From his afflictions, too, he should be glad: But, since ther's as much bane, as blisse, in these; Give, what thou knowest fittest to be had. And, let an Eccho, from this VOICE, redound Vnto thy praise, an everlasting-sound. Amen. FINIS. Carmen Eucharisticon: A PRIVATE THANK-OBLATION, Exhibited to the Glory of THE LORD OF HOSTS, FOR The timely and wonderfull Deliverance, vouchsafed to this Nation, in the routing of a numerous Army of Irish Rebells before Dublin, by the Sword of his valiant Servant, MICHAEL JONES, Lievtenant-Generall for the Parliament of England. Composed by Geo. Wither Esquire, August 29. 1649. The longest-lasting Sacrifice Is that, which most neglected lies. Sweet Incense into nothing fumes; The Fat of Beasts away consumes; A Song, which doth God's Works commend, Continues longer; yet, hath end: But perfect-love is an Oblation, Which hath no finall consumation. Publike-Duties being done, By my self, Ile now alone, Consummate a Private-one. Therefore, O my Soul! awake; And, let both, with heart and tongue, Such a Song of Praise be sung, That, thereby, both old and young, Of God's mercies heed may take. For, such Trophies (though now waved) Moses, Deborah, and David, When they from their foes were saved, Did, with good acceptance, raise: And (though other Thank-Oblations Perish'd, with their Generations) God is, yet, throughout all Nations, Honor'd by their Songs of Praise. We, to thee, O Lord! have praid, Thanks returned, sung, and said, And, our common-duty paid, As we could perform the same: That, which we have seen, and heard, Of thy mercifull regard, Hath been openly declar'd, To the glory of thy Name. But, O God! we may as well Close the Seas up, in a shell, As inabled be to tell Thy Compassions large extent; Or, to make full illustration Of thy favours to this Nation, In our frequent preservation From the furious Foes intent. For, that single-mercy, Lord, Which this Day we do record, Many mercies doth afford, More then all men can perceive. That Deliverance, made way For another joyfull-day, And that, peradventure, may Bring to passe, what we would have. With vain Moab, did conspire Ammon, Amalek, and Tyre, Threatning, like consuming fire, To destroy thy chosen Flock; And, in hope, their will to do, They have hired Balaam too, With false Prophets many moe, To advance a stumbling-block. Of their vaine presumings proud, They like Thunder from a cloud, Did begin to roar aloud In deluded peoples ears; And their empty vanities, Blushlesse brags, and shamelesse lies, Fill'd the hearts of men unwise, With false hopes, and causelesse fears. The fool'd Welsh, the faithlesse Scot, And our English mis-begot, Joyning in an Irish plot, Sought to root us from the Land: They with Sulphur, Sword, and Flame, Round about our dwellings came, And, had brought us all to shame, Had not, God, stretch'd forth his hand. But, he, thereof notice took; And, as Sisera he strook, With his Host, by Kishon-brook; So, he smote them in their pride: And, the same successe they had Which befell to Benhadad, When, the like account he made, That, the spoile he should divide. For, whilst Ormond, and while Taaff, In their Tents, did game, and quaff, (At our sad condition laugh) And, of Captives predispos'd; Then, that Arm, which they despis'd, Suddenly, their Camp surpriz'd; And, the snares, which they devis'd For our feet, their owne inclos'd. Mich'el, and his Angells, there Threw their Dragon-Cavaliere, With his Angells, from our Sphere, In confusion, to their owne; Where, unable to repent, They despairingly lament, And blaspheme with discontent, Him, that hath such mercy showne. For, though (blinded in their sin) Outwardly, they jeer and grin; Hellish horrors lurk within, Filling their faint hearts with fears: Their chief refuge, is a lie; And, which way soe're they fly, Guilt pursues them with a cry, Which the God of Justice hears. Their accusing conscience, feels Vengeance following them at heels, And, her dreadfull Charet wheels Threatning, what to them is due: Yet, infernall indignation, Stirs them up to vindication, Height'ned by a desperation Of those ends, which they pursue. And, that made them take the field, (Trusting in their sword and shield) When their conscience bid them yeeld: But, they soon did back retire, And, to fly away began, As when the Philistins ran, From the sword of Jonathan, And, but one sleight armed Squire. Never was there such a day Seen till then at Dublin. Ballacleagh, Since the The River at Dublin. Liffy wash'd her Kea, And, there, first, the The Sea Water. Sea-Nimphs met: For, God's arm, did there, and then, Give us Limster back agen, When it was nigh lost; and, when, Hope, was with despairs beset. Yet, as if that daies successe, Had too little been, unlesse He consider'd our distresse, In our London-Derry friends; Or, lest els, blind ignorance Might judge, that an act of chance, He, our free deliverance, Into Ulster, too, extends. And, by that redoubled blow, Gave another overthrow; For, Designements one or two, By that means dissolved be: Which hath so inraged them, That, they raile, revile, blaspheme, And their own beleefe condemn, For believing what they see. Oh! what pen, or tongue is there Fully able to declare, What, to us, GOD'S Mercies were Since our Champion he hath been? Nay, who can half that recite, VVhich for us, in open sight, He hath done since Nasby-Fight, Where, he, first, was plainly seen? He hath magnifi'd his worth In most glorious marchings forth, From the South, unto the North, And, through all our British-Coasts; England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Towns, and Fields, and Hills, and Dales, Sea, and Land, him, justly calls The Victorious Lord of Hoasts. Frequently, our eyes behold, Mercies, great and manifold, Such, as were in times of old, By his Chosen Flock enjoy'd: Such, as were vouchsafed, when Hundreds, chased were by ten; Thousands, by a hundred men, And great Hoasts, by few destroy'd. VVe have seen God marching, so, VVith our Friends, against our Foe, As he did, long time ago, VVhen his Isr'el were opprest: And, securing us from feare; VVhen our hopes at lowest were; VVhen despis'd, we did appeare, And our perill most increast. VVhen all seem'd at once on fire; VVhen our Brethren did conspire, VVith our Foes, to blow that higher, VVhich did flame too high, before; VVhen within their hearts they said, We so deep, our Plots have laid, That divine, with humane aid, Shall prevent them, now no more. Yea, when said it was by some, What is of their God become, Who, they dream'd, should save them from What our Counsell hath decreed? Then, did God, himself, arise; Then, his Arme, in glorious wise, Saves us from our Enemies, In the times of greatest need. And not only from their power, (Arm'd, and gaping to devoure,) Hath he kept this Land of our, But, he more then this hath done; Them, who to inslave us thought, And, our causlesse ruine sought, Underneath our feet he brought, That they might be trod upon. Nay, we have, yet more to say: Though our Foes, lie night and day, In our bosomes, to betray; And, disguised are like Friends; God, hath still prevented so, VVhat their malice prompts them to, That, themselves, they still undo; But, accomplish not their ends. VVe have seen God, in our daies, VValking on, in all those waies, VVhich (to his eternall praise) VVere in former Ages, trod: In our joyes, and when we weep, In our wakings, in our sleep, On the Heights, and in the Deep, VVe have seen thy steps O God! We have seen, here, where we dwell, Works of thine, which parallel All that ancient-stories tell Touching either Foes, or Friends. Yea, if all Records were lost, We by that, which now thou dost, Might collect what do we must, And, what each mans way attends. We have seen (and see we shall) What to Pharoah did befall, And ordained is for all VVho shall obstinate remain: VVe have seen, that upon such, Plagues, or Mercies work not much, And, that these two often touch On some, softned hearts, in vain. VVe have known men, once or twice, VVarned; yea, afflicted thrice; Yet, habituated Vice, In her posture doth abide: And, her Lovers, without stop, Prosecute their fruitlesse hope, Though their Partners daily drop, Down to hell, on ev'ry side. We have seen the pride of Kings, With those much desired things, Whence their vain ambition springs, Scorn'd, despis'd, and set at nought. VVe, their silk, their pearls, their gold, And their precious Jemms, behold Scattred, pawned, bought and sold; And to shame, their glory brought. VVe have seen fair seeming Starrs, Thither tumbled from high Sphears, VVhere their vanity appears; And that wisemen may dispense VVith deluding Sophistries, To promote, what they devise, Till they put their trust in lies, Through a reprobated sense. VVe have seen, when God, once, makes Search for Blood, what hills he shakes; VVhat high Cedars, down he breaks; And what portion he prepares For Apostates, Balaamites, For blood-thirsty Canaanites, And self-seeking Hypocrites, VVhen their sin at full appears. All these things, and many moe Such as these, we see and know: Oh! that we could mind them too! And our lives thereby amend: For his Mercy shown of late, (And which we commemorate, By Commandment from the State) Was vouchsafed to that end. Let us therefore not suppose, 'Tis enough to do like those, VVho make only Verball showes Of the duties in command; For, unlesse, in deeds, as well As in words, our thanks we tell, As unthankfully we deal, As if we had curst, and ban'd. Yea, although our Temples ring Of Gods praise; though loud we sing, And all those Thank-offrings bring, VVhich the Formalist oblates; Yet, if we perform no more, He our presents doth abhor, As the hiring of a whore, And our vain Lip-service hates. If, we therewith, do not heed, How with us God doth proceed; And, how, he at every need, Hears us, timely, when we call; That, to such, as helplesse lie, VVe may yeild the like supply, VVhen to us, for help they cry; VVe, ere long time, rue it shall. Yea, unlesse we pity more The oppressions of the poore, Then we have done heretofore, And to Justice more adhere; This, will prove but a delusion, And all mercies in conclusion, Bring upon us just confusion, When such vengeance we least feare. Still, in selfnesse if we live; Much receive, but nothing give; Cheare our selves, and others grieve; We are in the way of death: And, of whatsoe're esteem, In our owne conceits, we seem, God will cast us quite from him, If we settle in that path. For, it is for nothing lesse Then this Nations righteousnesse, Or, our sakes, that God doth blesse Those designes we undertake: But, 'tis rather from their sin, Who have our opposers been, Whence our Victories begin, And, for God's free mercy sake. For no goodnesse of our owne, Did God's hand the King uncrowne, And pull other Tyrants downe; Nor, because, he, yet, doth see That our zealous Protestations, Or pretended Reformations Gf our great abhominations, With our practises agree. But by mercie he makes way To his feare; that, yet we may Hear his voice, while 'tis, to day; Whereunto, if we incline, Maugre, then, all former sinnings, Our late seasonable winnings, Shall be pledges, and beginnings Of a mercy more divine. Oh, now therefore, let our praise Be right-walkings, in his wayes, And, believing what he saies: Let our thankfulnesse be, still, In true charity exprest; In relieving men opprest; And, indeavouring our best, In obedience, to his will. Let us prudently forbeare To wax proud, or domineere, When God, for us, doth appeare; And, with awe expresse our joy: Lest, if we presumptuous grow, He may (for our doing so) Turne his anger from our Foe; Or, both him and us destroy. We have seen the strong defeated; By himself, the cheater cheated; Men ambitious lower seated; And, long-fixed Pow'rs remov'd; Nay, ev'n such as we reputed Things divinely constituted, Are destroy'd; and, they confuted, Who, have them, for such, approv'd. We have seen those things despised, Which our Fathers highly prized, And the whole earth Idolized; Therefore, let us, now, for ever, Constant be to that perfection, Which deserveth not rejection, And, renounce our vaine affection To the waies of our deceiver. Let those things, which God hath done For these Isles, be thought upon, Not at such set times, alone, As the Civill Pow'rs command; But, now let us, all our dayes, Meditate his works, and waies, And be mindfull of his praise; Whilst there shall be Sea, or Land. And, Oh my eternall Lord! Let thy al-subduing Sword, But, that chiefly of thy Word, Thus prevaile, for evermore; Make it still victorious grow, Till to thee all Monarchs bow, And, till vengeance thou shalt throw On the Dragon, and the Whore. Well accept, this day, what wee Have in publike offred thee; And, this private Mite, from me, Which I now presume to add: For, in ev'ry Act of Grace, Which by thee vouchsafed was, Since my breathings in this place, I, some speciall fruits have had. In the many variations Of thy works, and dispensations, Unto these divided Nations, I have learn'd to find out thee. I, by them, thy mind discover, And, I daily read thee over, As my God, King, Father, Lover; And, as all in all, to mee. I have found thee in their failings; In their losings, and prevailings; In their joyes, and their bewailings; In their hardnesse, and their blindnesse: In their Trust, and their suspitions, In their false, and true professions, In their good, and bad conditions; In their love, and their unkindnesse. And, although this Generation, Yet, beholds not what relation, To their fall, or preservation, My despised Poems have; Some, ere long, will better heed them, And (though few, now, think they need them) Thou, wilt give them cause to read them, VVhen I shall be in my grave. Oh! till then, let me persever, My known duties to endeavour, VVith true patience, howsoever Thou shalt exercise my Faith: And, in ev'ry strong Temptation, Tryall, Straight, or Tribulation, Mind me, for my Consolation, VVhat, thy truthfull Spirit saith. To what ever, thou shalt call me, Or, what ever may befall me, Let no Terrene-Power appale me, From declaring of thy Truth; Let me, all my wits apply, Thy great Name to magnifie, VVhilst I live; and when I die, Let thy praise be in my mouth. And, when here I have compleated, That, for which I was created, Let me thither be translated, VVhere thy Saints, the Lamb attend; That, I, may in praising him, There communicate with them, In that everlasting Hymn, VVhich, will never have an end. AMEN. HALELUJAH. FINIS. A Suddain Flash By BRITANS REMEMBRANCER. Timely Discovering, Some Reasons wherefore, the stile of PROTECTOR, should not be deserted by these NATIONS, with some other things, by them very considerable. It was first made visible, The fourth day, after the Author heard it reported, that the Lord Protector, had waved the Title of KING. ? Poetis Quidlibet audendum, semper fuit, estque Potestas. A Preoccupation, relating to this Title. If some shall think, this Book mis-nam'd hath been, Because, so long a Flash was never seen; Know; that, through Cranies, it did thither fly, Where Touchwood, and where smoking Flax did ly, Which kindling, made it longer then intended; And, was a chance, that cannot now be mended. But, Flashie Names, and things, those times beseem Which, do not solid-serious things esteem. And, they who are not pleas'd to run a Course, On Pegasus, may, like a Hobby-horse. To his Highnesse, the Lord PROTECTOR. Sir, though this Poem's Title, fitted be To what I hear, the World expects from me Upon this Subject; yet, a seriousnesse It hath, and shall no Flashie-things expresse; For, tis a Flash of light, as well as Fire, Which, may give sight of somthing you desire, And such, as will no way disparage you, To give them, either hearing, or, a veiw. Betwixt your Highness and the Parlament, I, purpose not to cherish that Dissent, Which lately was begun; nor do intend That, which may justly you, or them, offend; But rather, to unite you so together, That, Disadvantage, may befall to neither By what, your Adversaries hope to finde Effected; (if, you have a changing minde) And, upon hope whereof, they did prepare To act, according as resolv'd you were. I am not for my self, yet, grown so wise That, when at hazzard, Publick safety lies, I can be silent; though I both disease My self; and others, oftentimes, displease, By my expressions, who, have pow'r and will, To mischieve me, who, purpose them no ill: For, though a well approved Author sayes, To please great men, it merits not least praise; I think, he merits more, who speaks in season, Truths, warranted by conscionable Reason, (Although on him, a Prince's wrath it brings) Then, if he flatter'd Parlaments and Kings. In that respect, I judg'd it not amisse, Unto your ear, or eye, to offer this, A few weeks past: But, things did intervene That seem's of more concernment to have been; And kept it off, untill nigh out of date, It was become; and came almost too late. Yet, since good use may thereof still be made, And some advantage also, thereby had; It, now comes forth, that, witnesse it might bear To that, which now, resolv'd on, doth appeare. For, though we know there is in every thing, But one Essential Truth; yet, thence may spring Such various Illustrations, as perchance, The certainty thereof, may much advance, When it appears, they, did the same Truths own, Whose judgments, to each other were unknown: For, when there is thereof no mediation But, as their spirits have communication, It doth assure, it flow'd from Providence, And, not from any carnal influence. Your eye, sees much; and yet it cannot see It self, or, what the colours of it be, Save by inferiour things; and, through inspections Acquired, by the medium, of reflexions From sight-less objects; through which; you may learn Those truths, which they themselves, do not discern: And, such like Objects, peradventure, He Who offers this and these his offers be. SIR, therefore now be pleas'd, one houre, to hear What, by my Muse, is fitted for your ear, And was prepar'd long since, to be presented (Though accidentally, till now prevented) And, if it be not such, as, then, will seem To merit, some part, of your goodesteem, And, usefull to preserve, and to increase Your Honour, safety, and the Common-peace; Return it, with an Ignominious Dash, And, let it then, (in scorn) be call'd, a Flash. Britans Remembrancer. A Suddain Flash Made visible, the fourth day after his Highnesse the Lord Protector had first waved the Title of KING. A Prologue, to him, who shall behold, or hear, this Flash. A Flash, I term this; and 'tis like enough That, many men, will call it so, in Scoff; But, I have got before them; and have, too, Some Reason, wherefore I have call'd it so: For, to, mine ears, when first that news was brought, A thousand thoughts, Flusht in, and this Flasht out; Which, I have, now, thus Paper'd up, for thee, To bring to minde what is, and what may be. Although it speaks in Rimes, it Rimes with Reason; And comes in Hast, that it may come in Season. If thou regard it, so. If not: my Cost, Is Paper, Inck, and part of three dayes lost. Thine may be more; For, much affraid I am, That, thou, who saw'st this Flash, wilt see a Flame, (Unless an intervening Providence Prevents, what likely seems, to give Offence) Which, here will burn, as well as give a light, Till it hath purg'd us, or, consum'd us, quite. The Flash. My Muse, hath on a suddain, once again, Invited me, to this unusual strain; Which, as the state of my Affairs, now stands, Hath put upon me Dangerous Commands: But, I, who must obey Her when she calls, (What ever hazzard, on my self befalls) Submitted to expresse, what I should finde Infused by her pow'r, in to my mind; And, hearing that his Highnesse, had deny'd The Kingship, thereupon, thus versifi'd: For, Poets (priviledg'd, as Prophets were) Their Inspirations freely may declare. But, hath he wav'd that Title? and, I pray, Are you aright inform'd of what you say? Did not a false-report, your ears abuse? A Crown! a Triple-Crown doth he refuse? And will not he as Bishops us'd to do, Say, No, and take it, as compell'd thereto? Oh Miracle of men? doth he deny A Kingship! freely offered! which, to Buy So many thousand Princes, have made sale Of Fame, Faith, Conscience, Body, Soul, and all? If this (as you affirm it is) be true; Friends; bid henceforth, your jealousies adue: And, let him who mistrusts him, any more; Suspect his Honest wife, to be a Whore, And in his brest, the torments thereof cherish Till he repent that injury, or perish. But, since I know what many do surmize, (And, what objections malice doth devise) Let me a little more expostulate; Is it not (think you,) done to palliate The souldiers humor? or, a Trick of State To draw on some thing more, yet aimed at? Is it not by Design, to bring about Advantages, by oversight left out? Or to delay, a while, what he intends, To feel the Peoples pulse? or for such ends? No doubtlesse: Then, make answer but to Three Short Questions more, and they the last shall be. Expects he not, when twenty dayes, are past, It should be, Nolens volens, on him cast? Nor is it so; for, by that Instrument, Which doth yet regulate this Government, No Law thereto repugnant, can be made Whereto, his free assent, shall not be had: And, Really, refusall he doth make, In Christian prudence, and for Conscience sake; That, he may give no cause of those Offences, Suspitions, Scandals, and ill consequences, Which may ensue; And, whereof, Honest men Are much affrayd: Why, did he suffer, then, So long time in Debatings, to be spent, (Since he at first discovered what was meant) And, did not interdict them to proceed? That, had been a dishonourable deed: For, in so doing, he should have prejudg'd, The Parlament; them disimpriviledg'd; And, thereby, some Experiments have lost, Which are more worth, than twice the time they cost. Beside, the matter is of too much weight, Each way, to passe, till ballanced aright; And, you have heard it said, what those men are Who Judge a Cause, before the same they hear. Thus far tis well: But, will he not at last When some few more, fit Complements are past, Accept what's offer'd? what he did, is known: But, what he will do, cannot be foreshown: And, we shall wrong Him (as he should the State Have injur'd) if, we him prejudicate. We may conjecture: And, if I may give My Judgement, by the Symptoms I perceive, He never will accept it, till, he shall By Faith and Reason, be convinc'd in all And ev'ry Scruple, which, this day, offends His Conscience; or dissatisfies his Friends: Beyond which, he, that ought would move him to, Doth, what no wise, or honest man, should do; And, would not care, though he were quite destroy'd So, his own Lust, and Will, might be enjoy'd. If so, then, me he hath not, yet, deceiv'd In any thing, which I of him believ'd Since first I heeded, by what Point he steers; (What Rock on this hand, what on that, appears;) What most men are, with whom he hath to do; And, why, few know, which way, he means to go. His Foes, though with his Bullocks they have plow'd, Have got nought thereby, whereof to be proud. And, as I live, I, am thereof, as glad, As, therefore, many others will be sad; And, if I were (as I have been) a Boy I should make Squibs, and Bonefires, now for joy, As many would have done, had he compli'd With their desires, whose Offer is deni'd. For, in his condiscending to be King, He could have been, at best, no greater thing Than other Earthly Princes: But, hereby He may ascend unto a Soveraignty, Which raiseth him, nine Orbes above their Sphear, To be inthroned, where Immortals are: And, me, it hopefull makes, to see that Age, Which, Britains genius, did, long since, presage In that Prediction, wherein, was among Some other things, this following distick sung: A King, shall willingly himself unking, And thereby grow farr greater than before. For, now, fulfilled seemeth, in effect, What, that vaticination did predict; Although there should a Power elswhere reside To bring to passe, what is by him deni'd. Victorious Cromwell! thou, hast, herein, gone Beyond thy self; and such an Act hast done, As few or none, in this, or forraign Climes, Have equalled, in any former times. A self-denial like this, none, but He Could teach, who, that he might our pattern be, The Thrones &amp; kingdoms of this world did slight, When he was born up thither, where, he might (And did) behold them, spreading forth to view All their Inchanting pleasures, false or true: And from him onely, could that grace proceed, Whereby, thou dost perform so brave a deed. Thou often hast deserved Mural-Crowns, For taking Castles, with high walled Towns, And making in subjection, to thy powers, Great Cities, fortifi'd with Walls and Towers: To thee, for brave Achivements on the Maine The chief of Navall Trophies, doth pertain: Triumphant Laurell, to adorn thy brows, To thee is due, for giving ovethrows To dreadfull Armies, that, had else inslav'd Thy Country; which, God, by thy sword hath savd. Thou hast subdued Kingdomes, and great Kings; Whereby, their Crowns, their Scepters &amp; all things Belonging to such Conquerors, are thine, As truly, as the Clothes I wear, are mine. Yet, these are flight, and petty Foes compar'd To some, with whom, thou secretly hast warr'd: And, for those Conquests, thou I hope, dost carry A Tablet, with a secret Honorary; Whereby thy vertues fully be rewarded, With Trophies, of most worth, though lest regarded. These wayes, thou wert Victorious heretofore; And, I will mention one great Conquest more. By few observed: Thou hast stood the Shock Of malice and detraction, like a Rock, On which the waves and billows of the Main, Have spent their strength, and foam'd out rage in vain. I, very often, have observ'd the fell, Feirce, raging, and three headed dog of Hell, With his three double rows of teeth, assay To tear thine honour, and thy pow'r, away; With his foule tongues, bespattering thy fame, To turn thy blooming honour into shame; I've seen this Cur oft, dog thee in the dark, In hope to bite thee, when he durst not bark; And, I have heeded, by what sacred Charms, Thou hast been hitherto, preserv'd from harms. This Helhound, thou hast tam'd without so much As giving him a crust, a spurn, or touch; Meerly by meekness, and, as passing by With disregard of causlesse injury; And, now he sometimes fawns on thee and those, Who are thy friends; and, snarleth at thy foes, As if he were appeas'd: which, I believe Is but a cunning dog trick, to deceive. And, yet, among those victories, which lye Most visible unto the vulger eye, This, thy last conquest, merits admiration Beyond the rest; And, with perseveration If thou maintain the same, as thou maist do, By his help, who hath aided hitherto, Thou hast thereby a pledge, that, God will never Forsake thee; but, thy guardian be for ever. Thou hast already scap'd, the best tride snare; That Sathan, or his agents, can prepare: For, 'twas the last, of those temptations, which He practis'd by, our Saviour, to bewitch: And, as when that grand-tryall, had an end His Angels, did forthwith, on him attend Rejoycing in his conquest; so, will, too, For thine, all, thy most faithfull servants do. Thou hast thereby, so strengthned all their hands, So cheered all their hearts, throughout these lands, Who prayd, or feared for thee, in this tryall; That, thou, of nothing now, canst have deniall, Wherein their love may serve thee; and they shall More fortifie thee, than a Brazen wall; More comfort thee, than ought that can be had From any Title, that the world shall add: And, thou at last, shalt finde, thou dost not lose One grain, of what thou lately didst refuse, By that refusall: for, thou shalt have more (If not in kind) in value, than before. Yea, peradventure, that, in specie, too, When, qualified, no offence to do; And, when it hath been prov'd, whereto thy mind VVithout dissimulation is inclin'd. For, tis not meer negation of that title, VVhich is thy Test; since, that availeth little One way or other, save as unto that VVhich brought it hath unto dislike of late; Or, as it may concern some past transactions, VVhich, have occasioned dissatisfactions In many of this Nation; or, as thou Mayst scandalize them, by thine actings now. But, that, wherein thy reall proof will be, Lockt, from mens eys, lyes hid, with God, and thee: And, whatsoever thou resolv'st upon, Will either Well, or else not well, be done, As, unto those things, they relating are, Which unto God, and Thee alone, appear. The washing of th'Assyrian in the water Of Jordan, was but an indifferent matter, Till made the sole condition of his Cure: And, doubtlesse, had not that, been in his pow'r, He had been Cleans'd without it. David's sin In Numb'ring of the People, lay not in That simple Act; but, in the secret Pride And Disobedience, which did then reside Within his Heart; And, when it shall appear That Thou, from Guiltiness, art that way clear; And, hast repented all those Humane failings, Which have, in ought, obstructed thy Prevailings: Then, shall the gift-refused, neither be A Scandall unto Others, or to Thee, Although accepted; when thou hast resisted So far, as Grace and Reason, have assisted. For, should the Pow'r-Coordinate with thine, O're-pow'r thee so, that, thou thereto incline (Consenting to their Motives at the last) Thy Conscience bearing witnesse, that thou hast Complied there withall, rather by force Than Choise; to keep bad things, from being worse: Or, if by strength of Reason, swayd thou art To that Acceptance; thou, hast done thy part: And, shalt by yeelding, pass another Trial As honourable, as, is this Denial. Thou shalt be safe, from all that was portended, Shouldst thou by Levity, have condiscended, Or, tempted been by Self-ness, to forgo That Title, thou hast owned hitherto; And wilt be free from blame, what ever shall Hereafter, by the Change thereof befall. For, nothing shall amisse to thee succeed, By what, is not Thine, but, anothers deed. No Reason, bindeth any to withstand, What, Pow'r, and stronger Reason, doth command; And, when perhaps too, God, his ayde withdraws, From thy assistance, in this dubious cause, To bring on them, whats due for their offence, Who trust their own Wits, more than Providence. This, I expresse here, not to leave a Gap Whereby, thou may'st from Just Resolves escape: (For, God will find it out, if there be ought To such a purpose, lurking in thy thought:) But, that, thou may'st not fall into a Snare By things, which in themselves, Indifferent are; (Nor good nor evill, but, as unto that Which may be good, or Evill, they relate;) And, to preserve thine Honour, among those Who shall, perchance, their Expectations lose By what may come to passe; (yea, to prevent That, which may thereof, be a Consequent To thee disserviceable) I, am bold To tell thee, what my Muse to me hath told; Which, dictates, otherwhile in Slighted rimes, That, which doth much concern these present times; And, would, it may be, had it not been Mine, Suppos'd have been, an Off-spring, more divine. But, I, my, Musings now, to those will bend Who may, perhaps, mistrust what I intend. Although I have, by this Anticipation, Presented that unto consideration, Which may be profitable (if revers'd His purpose be, on Tearms before rehears'd) Yet, least, I may with one hand, be suspected To pull down, what the other had Erected; I will not smother ought, which I shall finde, May justly fortifie him in the minde, By him profest; untill, to drive him out Of his Resolve, Those Reasons may be brought, Which will be stronger; lest, some, should surmize He; without Cause, deni'd what he denies; Or, lest my late Rejoycings, may appear As Reasonlesse, as many think they were. My gladnesse of it, flow'd from no respect Unto my self, or, fears of an effect By Kingship, which my profits might impair: For, I have, that way, likelihoods more fair Than I have now (if nothing it occasions, To break our Peace, at Home, or, by Invasions From Foes abroad) nor can I scandal'd be, Thereby, through ought, which will reflect on me: But, I rejoyced in it, for the sake Of Him, who did this Title undertake; And, for their sakes, who Acted and Enacted, Things, whereby possibly may be contracted Great Scandals; or, which may a new expose My Country, to be spoiled by her Foes. For these, and such respects as these (together With what may be again transferred hither, My Heart, that was through fear of them, grown sad, Became through hope of their prevention, glad. For, what a black Scene, should we here have seen? How many greeved hearts, would here have been, Had our Protector, either been estranged From what he was, or, (seem'd to be) so changed, As, lightly to forgo his interest In that, wherewith he had been so much blest? Or, should by others, have been so deluded, As, to let that upon him be obtruded, Which He himself disclaim'd? and, may bring back A King upon us, with his Pedlars Pack Of Vanities, which have been by this Nation Rejected by a solemn protestation: And, which are Trinckets, as unseparable From most Kings, as is from a Fool, his babble? For, there is nought more likely, in, to bring Him that's expelled, then, to make a King, At this time; and, to make on that accompt (Which is design'd) that Title paramount: Nor can there be, for what our Foe intends, A better ground-worke laid, by all his friends. These things I feared; and, my soul foresees That, all those things may creep in by degrees, Which, to the Kingdomes of this World pertain; Which, may inslave the Saints of God again; And, which, may in a short time, reinvest With that pow'r, which impowred Antichrist: Unlesse, it by his Mercy, be withstood Whose wisdome, can from Evil, bring forth Good. These things I fear'd, and if a Parlament Can make a King, which may these fears prevent; Him, and his Nobles, if it can so bind, That, we may be secured in this kind; And keep our Sov'raign, and these Nations free From scandals, which occasioned may be; I, should not only yeild, on that condition To make a King, but beg one by Petition. Redouble, that rejoycing, which appear'd, When, of what was resolved, I first heard: And, make my heart, the first step, whereupon He might set foot, to mount up to his Throne: Yea, sing a Panegyrick in their praise Who mov'd it, that should long out-last my daies. We look for such a Government, as shall Make way for Christ: not that fantastical Fifth Monarchie, whereof some people dream, And Conquer would an Earthly Throne for him With Carnal weapons: But, that, present here He, may so be, and so to reign, appear As he hath promis'd; and, that Righteousness And Truth, may ev'ry Throne on Earth possess, According to that measure of his grace, Which is apportion'd, to this earthly place. His Highness, hath made progress in a path As far forth toward it, as any hath Since Christ ascended; if, the Depths and Heights, The Rugged passages, and Narrow Streights Consider'd be, through which his March he makes, To bring to end the Work he undertakes. He must now pass a Rock, which will require An Ingeneer with Vineger and fire; And, cut a Passage, which (as by a thread) Must on each hand, ev'n to a hairs-breadth, lead 'Twixt Conscience and sound Reason: whence, to vary Were irrecoverably to miscarry. Oh God! assist him; and, to what I pray Amen, let all, who wish our welfare, say. He, hitherto, in that which he hath done, His Work, with prudency, hath carried on: And, firm to his own Principles abides, Though many strive to bring him to their sides: Yea, though there be some too, of whom he may (As David of Zerviah's Sons did say) Complain, that, they, were oft for him, too hard; Yet, Him from his Resolves they have not stirr'd. And (be it well considered of all you, Who read this, and, perchance miscensure now Of his Heroick Act) he doth not wave Ought necessary for a Prince to have; Which had been a Denial, in effect, Of that Pow'r, which his People should protect; And, were no Self-denial, (as I gather) But, a denial of his Duty rather. The Kingship is not wav'd, but, as it tends To what may much disconsolate his friends, Or glad his foes; And, which, as things yet stand, Relating to Pre-actings in this Land, Might draw on very evil Consequences; Or give just cause of many great Offences: Could these removed, or prevented be, So that his Conscience, might from them be free, Perchance, That, to take place it would permit As rational, which so appears not yet. For to the Clean, he knows all things are Clean, And (if I guess aright what he doth mean) That, whereof, he doth chiefly scruple make, Is, Giving an offence unto the weak; And, that, therewith, all things now startled at Might pass, when he upon them shall debate, If God, informs his Conscience, that they may; And Reason shall his Reasons oversway. He nothing hath refus'd with disrespect To them who offer'd it: Or, with neglect Of ought propos'd for Publick benefit: But, only, what may possibly beget More Jealousie than Love: more Envy, then Glory to God, or good to Honest men. And, he by his Refusal, unto none Denyeth ought, but, to himself alone; Or, that, which he doth probably believe Will marre our peace, and Civil wars revive: For which, if worse, he rather speed than better, His merit is the more; his praise the greater; And, they, who shall the lesse affection show him, For that, deny the duty which they owe him. What, if he thinks the changing of his Title, Implies a levitie, which doth but little Beseeme a Prince? and may occasion too A quarrell, which might all his work undo? Or propagate a mischievous effect, To their destruction whom he should protect? Is he not bound in Conscience to beware Of such a Title, whosoe're they are That shall propose it? should he not betray His Trust, by giving easily away That earnest of Protection, which doth seem To be, by God, conferred upon him For safeguard of his Saints? or, might there not Some blemish be in Reputation got, Relating to that Stile? if, he, the same Should change for that, by which their bondage came? And can he think it nothing signifies, That, they, who are his greatest Enemies Do more rejoyce, in that which was intended, Then they, by whom, he hath been best befriended? If, likewise, with a serious heed, he shall Be pleased to consider therewithall, What kind of men, the greatest number are Who, for this change most zealous do appear; What Interest it is, which they would save: What Principles, the most among them have; Can he suppose, more safe for him, it were To these, then to his best friends, to adhere? Whose Conversations, are to him well known? Whose cause is his? Whose principles his owne? Since, Reason, doth incline him, to the last, And Conscience, too, the ballance that way cast? That Title, which hath hitherto been own'd, With victories and blessings, hath been crown'd; It, now, hath rendered it selfe exempt For ever, from that undeserv'd contempt Which novelty occasion'd; and, throughout The World, is with much honour spread about. He, thereby had a pow'r, which lately shook The wals of Babel; and with terror strooke His proudest foes; and, is it vanish'd, now, We neither know when or by what, or how? Except it be, for thanklesly despising So prosperous a Stile, and idolizing Of that, which forced us, in our affliction To take up that we have, for our protection. When, Israel would be King-rid, God, to shew His anger, and, what thereon would ensue, Destroy'd in Harvest time, their corne with showers; And at the Seed-time, he did hazzard ours By extream Drought; untill that was deny'd Which is propos'd; and, then, forthwith suppli'de Our present want: perhaps, to make us seek His will, and, know our sinne, and theirs alike: Lest, in his wrath, he give us what we crave, And take away, what he in mercy gave. What will ensue, by setling Kingship here, For common good, it doth not yet appeare: Some, doe pretend, it render will, to us, Our laws more fixt, and much more vigorous, Because, by Kings, they were to us deriv'd, And confirmation in their name receiv'd. But, wherefore, may not all that, which relates To King, or People, Freedoms, or Estates In our preceding Laws, be so Compacted Into one Statute, now to be Enacted, That, they may by his Highnesses assent, Be made as firm, as this new Instrument, By our Protector, who, must be the Stone First laid, to build their new fram'd work upon? Why may not He, who now is our Supream, Make both unto Himself, and unto them Who ask it of him, all our Laws forepast As Useful, and as Binding, as this Last? Why may not He, who is a Couquerer For Us, and did for us, receive his Pow'r Confirm our Laws, or any other thing, (As strongly, as if he were call'd a King) To Us, and to Himself, with their consent, Who by his Pow'r, are made a Parlament? Why, should it unto him, ought less afford, Than to all Princes, raised by the Sword? No man, can justly, that to him denay. For, Conquest is the ordinary way, Whereby, God changeth Governments, and flings From off their Thrones, great Emperors and Kings. And 'tis Gods mercy, not our own desert, Which, hitherto, hath so inclin'd his heart, That, though he hath been straightned more than any, His Arbitrary actings were not many; Nor, till they were constrain'd by some distress, For preservation of the Publick Peace. Some, think it will Secure his Person more, And, Charge the People less, than heretofore, To stile him King. But, these men much mistake, And, will perceive they Dream, when they awake: For, can we think, when he away hath thrown A Title, which God gave to be his own, Without a Rival, that, assume he may A Name, whereto another claim doth lay, With greater Safety? Is there some new charm, Infus'd into that word, to guard from harm? Or, will it make the Royalists more true To him, because, he takes what they think due, Unto another? Quite desert the Lord, They own'd, and, do their homage to a word? And, (where they hated) Loyaltie profess Rather, for doing More wrong, than for less? So foolish can we think them, as, to prize A Complement, which nothing signifies, Save, either some poor Hope, or vain Desire To be in Us, which may advance them higher, In those Resolves, which they had heretofore? And, make our Dangers no whit Less, but more? For, when they do perceive our Giddiness, Our falling from, those things we did profess, Our doating on those Bawbles, which we seem'd Not much (a while ago) to have esteem'd, Our Taking up, what we had Thrown away, Our sleighting that, to Morrow, which this day We made a Law; and that our Protestations, Were for the most part, but Dissimulations; Thence, they will take occasion to conclude That, we have, all along, such Ends pursude As they have had: And, that, what ere to seem We have made Shew, we are just like to Them. That, we did wade and swim, through streams of blood, Not to accomplish what is Just and Good; But, to obtain our Lusts: That, we have sought By Policy, and by our Battails fought, Against Opposers; not so much to save Our Liberties, as, others to inslave: That, our contests, were not for God, or, for Our Country; but, (which Goodmen will abhor To think upon) our owne selves, to invest With, that, which was by other men possest: That, being Hypocrites, in all we did, With Cloaks of sanctity, the same we hid, Thereby, to draw in those who were sincere, To be deceiv'd, in what we made appear. (Ev'n to the ruine, of their Children, Wives, Their Peace, their Freedoms, their Estates, their Lives) That, we might get high Titles, large Possessions, Power and Prerogatives, by their oppressions, And, that instead of setting Christ upon His Throne, we, might install our selves thereon. This will be thought: And, they who are our Foes, Will, peradventure, thereupon suppose That God is not among us, as they fear'd; Nor for us, as it formerly appear'd; And, thence take courage, to begin again That, which they hitherto pursu'd in vain. And, such will be the safety, which your King Unto Himself, and us, is like to bring. Good God! how are they chang'd? how stupifi'd? By whom these dangers are not yet espi'd? How blind, doth selfness, make us quickly grow, In that, which might prevent selfe-overthrow? Will Kingship, make him safer than he was? How may that be? how can it come to pass? That Title, not much more then eight years past, Could not preserve his Head, who reigned last. No, not preserve him, from the dreadfull fate, Of dying on a Scaffold, at his gate: And, if all things be weighed well together That Stile, as possibly may bring him thither, Who ruleth now; yea, and a tragical Effect therewith, perhaps, upon us all, Before the malice of our foes is ended, How safe soe're, to be, it is pretended. We may perceive, (unlesse we will despise, The Light within us, and seel up our eyes,) There is no likelyheod, it will abate Their fury, who pursue us with their hate; But, so increase it, that it will increase Those dangers, which we dream, it will make lesse: Yea, make Him, whose safe being it pretends, Vnsafe among those, who have been his Friends, And, them among themselves: It will go near, To make men of themselves, to stand in fear. It will increase suspitions, till th'effect Grows worse, than many of us can suspect: Divide, and subdivide, till there be nought Left possible to be said, done, or thought; To cure the mischieves, which will be effected; (And are by some, both hop'd for, and projected;) Except in mercy, He, that heretofore Hath oft so done; shall (pleased be) once more, To draw forth an Expedient, from our failing, Which, will for our advantage, be prevailing. More might be said; but, ought more to expresse Would be in vain to those, who cannot guesse The rest by this. And, yet, because the reason, Of saving charges, comes in such a season, As gives it weight; Let us examine, whether The Season, and the thrift, agree together, Lest, in that frugal humour we may die, And, gain an Epitaph, like this, thereby: Here, lies interr'd, the Miser, Father Sparges, Who might have liv'd: but died to save charges. I find your Thrift, you, think we might disband Those Armies, which are quarter'd through this Land, If our Protector were proclaim'd a King. It may be so; and I, the self same thing Should also think; if I considered not, We might thereby, as good as Cut our throat. Is any man so voyd of Common sense, As, not to see what might result from thence? May we not save the charge of paying One, And, let Two Armies in, when that is gone, To pay themselves, until at last, they shall In Contributions, and in Pay have all? You fear, perhaps, that by the Souldierie Our Laws, our Freedoms, and Proprietie May be destroy'd, if long imbodied here; And, cause enough there may be of that fear: But, will a King, prevent it? may not we Another way as much oppressed be, By some, who for our Liberties pretend Yet, Cry up Kingship, for their private end? May we not suffer at the Lawyers Bar, As much as we endured by the War, Through those Formalities, which make the Laws, Of our most sad oppression, one chief cause? The Sword unsufferably, (I confess) If not well disciplin'd, will us oppress: But, hitherto, it hath been in those hands, Which kept it serviceable in these Lands, With so much Moderation, that no time, Bears witness of the like in any Clime: And, though an Insolent proud Fool or twain, Cause, to some few, hath given to complain, Their Arbitrary actings, were not many; Nor to the ruine, or great loss of any. I wonder, any man can stand in awe Of Swords and Guns, who feels the plague of Lawe; And, would not rather be devoured twice By Lions, than once eaten up with Lice. Should I illustrate (which, my private wrong May, peradventure, force me to e're long) The sad discoveries which I have made Since first that Gangreeve, I, upon me had; By what impertinent vexatious wayes, Costly devices, or undue delayes, The Suits of wronged Clients forth are spun, More than twice twenty years, and yet not done; By what excessive Fees (twice or thrice tooke) Without one Line writ down, or one word spoke, And, at how dear a rate they sometimes buy A Vain hope, which augments their misery; How, Motions, Orders, and Reports beget Each other, till their brood grows Infinit; And, how some Registers, put out, or in, Those words, which may another Round begin, (Though they who heard the Judges Order, thought The Cause, would thereby to an end be brought) You would suppose (and might suppose it well) The Courts we toyl in, were some Rooms in Hell, And, that, we had imposed there on us The never ending Plague of Sysiphus, Who, up a Steep hill, rowled with great pain A Weighty Stone, which still rowl'd down again. Should I declare, how frequently our Lawes, Are pleaded to maintain a wicked cause; How rarely, good success on him attends, Who makes not way, by Kindred, Bribes, or Friends: What hazzards he is in, to be betrai'd, By them, for whose assistance, he hath paid? And, then, how far about, they make him run E're they will suffer him to be undone, You, would not greatly fear (no not at all) Courts-martial, or a Major Generall, But, rather, fear to fall into their claws, Who, to mens ruine, turne our wholsome Laws, Whose practise, being regulated, might Preserve our private and our publick Right: For, that, our Laws are good, confesse I do, And, that, we have some honest Lawyers, too. No men have more oppressed been of late This way, then, they who best have serv'd this State, And to support it, did themselves expose To hazzards, by accepting what our Foes Had forfeited, to be therewith repay'd, When, others, of such bargains were afraid: For, if it were observ'd, how they have sleighted Those Acts of Parlament, which, us invited Vpon the Publick credit, to lay forth Our selves, for Titles of such little worth In most mens value, that, but few or none Will take thereof, ten pounds, in pledg for one; It would appear, that, wee, among the rest Of those by them griev'd, have been most opprest. For my own part, I, now five years together, Have sought for Justice, and can yet get neither My Land nor Money: though by further cost, A thousand pounds are added to what's lost; Nor whither, for redress I may retire, Do I yet know; nor where, I can enquire: And, should I in each circumstance, declare My wrongs thereby, and what effects they are Which thence have followed, you would say, the sword Therewith compared, Mercies did afford; And, that, it more to our vexation tends, To be destroyed by our seeming-friends, With lingring torments; then, with one great blow, To be made sensless, by an open Foe. And, therefore, when I have considered well What I (and many moe) in this kind feel, I dare conclude, that if no course be found, Whereby, that Justice, may be here inthron'd, Which will redress these wrongs (and those that lye In thousands of Petitions hurled by, Without regard) the sword, will act once more; And, prove (I fear) more sharpe than heretofore, If mannag'd by a King; which, both to us, And to himself, will now be ominous. When we have made a King, which, will inlarge The common burthen, by a further charge, And added to the multitudes of those Which now are known, new bands, of bosome foes, Who, mad with vengeance, and with discontent, Will any way, their brutish passions vent; Will it be thriftiness, the charge to spare That, should for such a time, a guard prepare? Indeed, they few good pennyworths afford, Who measure all things, by the Pike and Sword; And none of us, I think, could well abide His Suits should in a Martial Court be tri'd; (Or, where they mannag'd are, till we could get More expedition, than we can have yet, With less expence) but, better sure it were, To spend a little quantity of tarre Then lose a Hog; and, to be some while willing For saving of a Pound, to pay a Shilling. Hard things, in great straights, must be undergone; Offensive guards, are better much than none. Are you asleep? and, see you not already That, being in our Purposes unsteady, Makes Bees, as well as Wasps, to Buz and Humme, And shew their Stings, portending what will come? Do not you hear what's murmur'd, as among The People, to and fro, you pass along? And, know you not, that, what is voyc'd abroad By them, is otherwhile, the Voyce of God? Then, know it now; lest, shortly, that be spoke Which, when once said, he never will revoke: And, though you sleight the Scriblings of my Pen, Learn wisdome, from your prudent Husband-men. Doth any sober Countrey Fellow, judge He saveth ought, by pulling up his hedge Before his Corn be hous'd, to leave (the while He therewith warms himself) his Crop to spoile? Or, put away his Dogs, that were imploy'd, To guard the Sheep, till Wolves are quite destroy'd? Consider these things; And, by these conceive What Prudence doth obliege us to believe Of all those other Arguments, you bring To make us change Protector into King; Or, to disarm these Nations, till we see This Common-wealth shall better setled bee But, 'tis the Reason of a Parlament, Which to our Prince, a Kingship doth present. True; And, it is the Reason of the Prince, (Yea, and his Conscience, too) which takes offence At what is offer'd; and 'tis not a case As yet decided, whether should give place. My Private Reasons, they might oversway, And, though 'twere not convinc'd, I must obey, Or Suffer: And thus for my Conscience too It must be, in things, which I cannot doe. But sure, his Highness (if it may be judg'd By private men) is much more Privileg'd: For, he whom God hath Raised up, or Sent To lay the Ground-work of a Government, Is with a Spirit, in all likelyhood By him who rais'd him, for that work indow'd; Yea peradventure, he is qualifide To that End, more than all men else beside, As will appear (though this to some seem strange) If we look back on every former change; And when to new Works, GOD doth Princes call, What Spirits, them he furnishes withall. Both Parlaments, and Councels general, Do many times into great errors fall; And for their Owne, or for the Peoples Sin (Or for some other causes) oft have been Deserted by their Guide; that, men may know Their Weal, from their Joint wisdome, doth not flow. When God will prove a People, or a Prince, It must, by somewhat, likely to convince, Attempted be: The Spirit, to be tride, In somewhat, must imbodied abide That's venerable: else, no Approbation Can thereon follow, worth Consideration. A Prophet, by a Prophet was deceiv'd; And yet, was therefore of his life bereav'd. It was ev'n by those men who seated were In Moses chair, (and whom Christ bad them hear) Who did so misadvise them, that, they cri'd To have the King of glory crucifi'd. Yet, they have been accursed till this day, Because, they did not as well try, and weigh, As hear their counsell; having, so to do, A rule of Faith, and Light within them, too. The Reason, therefore, of a Parlament, May be demurr'd upon, though it present A Kingdome: and, if any man may be Thus privileg'd, then, no man more than he Whom, it now most concerneth; and, who, must Give an accompt, for what he hath in trust. But, there is something, that perswades my heart, This Parlament, in acting of their part Hath not alone, done that which providence Will make to be, at last, without offence; But, serviceable also to that end. Which, God, and our Protector, did intend: Or, that they will, at least wise, have a care That nothing shall be urged to insnare His Conscience; or, be further on him prest Then so far, as the publick interest, And his, it may advance: For, these are gifts That often have put many to hard shifts To get them; but, till now I ne'r did know A Prince, that might not such a gift forego VVithout offence; or, that a Conquerour, To chuse his Title had not alwayes power. Nor can I think, that, he did so dispose Of his whole pow'r, when he impowred those For his assistance, that, himself he left But as a Cypher, of all pow'r bereft: Ev'n of enablement, by his negation, For that, which tendeth to the preservation Of his own conscience: and, of meanes to do That, which the Law of Nature, binds him to: For, their Petition, seemeth to imply That, somewhat, which they aske he may deny. And Reason sayes, that none should be confin'd From Powr, to doe the work to him enjoyn'd; Which, he would want, if of a Negative In such like things as this, they him deprive. I must confess, I stagger'd am, well neer, And almost overawed with a fear Of medling any further in this Point, Lest, I, may bring things farther out of joynt That stand awry: for, I am not a stranger To those Concernments which it may endanger, If, I, to common view, should bring out that Which is conceiv'd a Mysterie of State; Or, should intrench upon the Priviledges Which, due to Parliaments, this Nation judges: Nor am I ignorant, what might to me Thereby befall, should I suspected be, (As it is somewhat probable I may) For Arbitrary actings, to make way Beyond due Limits (which, I doe abhor With all my soul, to be a pleader for.) Yet, I were false to truth, should I not shew What Tools are to his undertakings due, Who must secure our Peace (because he may Make use of them perhaps another way.) The Drunkard sinneth by excess of Wine, Yet, we allow the planting of the Vine; And, I conceive it lawfull to express That, which may publique injuries redress, Although it may occasion some offence, Which is of an inferiour consequence. I know, what to a Parliament hath been Ascrib'd; and, I have felt, as well as seen What powr it hath, and what that powr may do, If, that exorbitance belongs thereto, Which many claim; and, which, it had obtain'd Untill it was by Providence restrain'd. It hath, to give it an enablement, The Peoples never failing Argument, Thereby, to make good, and oblige us to What they are pleas'd we should believe, or do: Ev'n this, (which oft doth puzzle and becumber The wisest men) an Over-voting Number. It acts by Presidents, which, may sometimes Make vertues to be punished as crimes: It takes a pow'r to make and unmake Treason; To bind and loose, as well our Faith as Reason; To raise, or pull down Kings; from their possessions, To throw men out; to punish for Transgressions, Before there have been Laws to make them such; And, hath unto it self assum'd so much, That, doubtless, if there be no power in Him Who should be Umpire, betwixt us and them, To moderate (nor any other way To qualifie) that which impose they may; No single Tyrant, now or heretofore, Did, or can for the future, grieve us more, Or more inslave, then we our selves may do, By means of those whom we shall trust unto: Nor to so many can those wrongs extend, Nor be so hardly brought unto an end; Consid'ring, that, things present to enjoy, Some, would their own posterity destroy. We have had dear experience, both, long since, And lately, what effects may flow from thence, If, neither in our selves, nor in another, Nor in them and a third pow'r, joyn'd together, There may be means to save from what we fear; Yea, we of our best hopes deprived are, And have but leap'd (by ought that see I can) Into the Fire, out of the Frying-pan: For, as things stand, when Deputies are chose, Whether, they be our faithfull friends, or foes; Whether, they have been well, or mis-begotten; Whether, their Principles be sound, or rotten; Whether, they shall be Prudent, or unwise; Whether, their votes be gained by surprize, Or not; and, whether, that which they conclude Be right or wrong; or, for our harm, or good, We have no remedy, but, must submit To whatsoever is adjudged fit: And, not presume to let a word be spoke Against it, lest their priviledge be broke. But, sure, there should some bounds be set to them; And, I believe there is, by that Supreme And Common law of Nature, which, in part Is writ (though much defac'd) in every heart. Therefore, that Law I very often read, And, many times, for common freedoms plead, As I finde cause; and, will not be afraid To plead it, when aside I see it laid, Though I have blame; And, though, some wil suppose And say, Beyond his Last, this Cobler goes. On that account, my Muse compels me, here To treat of things that seem beyond my Sphere; But, having for Affaires wherewith I deale A Warrant in my bosome, under Seale, I will proceed unto the point in hand, So far forth as the same I understand: For, that which is in question, differs not In what may follow, from the Gordian-knot; And, I should grieve to see it knit so fast, That, by the Sword, it must be cut at last, Or, all, thereby into a danger slide, If still, or overlong, it be unty'd. I know not what this Parliament can doe, Nor whether it be limited or no, By him who called it: but, I believe, It power with limitations did receive. And, this I know; that, if there doth reside A pow'r therein, to force what is deny'd, Maugre his Conscience, who the same to save From violence, doth one Proposall wave; I, thereupon conclude, it may as well Against his single-Reason, him compell; And with more shew of Justice, if the state Of that, which is in question, doth relate To Civill things; because, the reason shown Is joyntly then, the peoples and his own, They, being both his chosen Counsellors For such affaires, and Deputies of theirs; Who may as justly take his powr away To morrow, as his Title, on this day, Against his will; and, Him and His, expose To all the rage and malice, of his foes. If, from constraint, his Conscience be not free, Sad will the consequences thereof be. If, He, that freedom shall be barred from, What of our Christian freedoms will become? Who, as 'tis thought, have given them a power Without controule, to spare or to devoure, As they shall please. But, sure impowred thus They never were by God, our Prince, or us, By ought which tacitly did them invest With such powr; nor by any thing exprest; At least de jure, though we are in Fact Concluded by those Laws they shall enact. For whatsoere the law of God or nature, Confers upon the Reasonable creature, No Trust, as Deputies of ours, have they To meddle with (much less to take away) Untill by those Laws forfeited; unless For Publique weale, or succours in distress, For common safety. Nor, then, have they pow'r O're person, freedom, goods, or ought that's our In equity: unless, they also lay As equally as possibly they may, Those burdens upon all; lest, some beare nought, As lately; and, some bee to ruin brought; Whose prayres, cries, and vnredressed wrongs, Is that which our Vnsetlement prolongs. It wil be, therefore, our securest way, The Groundworke of our Government to lay Vpon some Just Act, which may expiate Those Sinnes that have committed been of late, Through our defect of Justice and Compassion, To them who have beene faithfull to this Nation, Ev'n to their owne undoing: were this done, The works which now goe Backward, would goe on; And, God, would make us lovingly comply; Instruct us what to Grant, or to deny. Till this be done, we onely shall contrive Snares for each other; or, at best, but strive Like Bees in hony-potts; and, be at last, Destroy'd by that, in which our hopes are plast. Yea, till these Nations, doe so constitute Their Parlaments, and them whom they Depute Obliges to fundamentals, they, shall never Theire Liberties enjoy; but bee for ever Exposd to Hazzards (which might be prevented, And none be therewith iustly discontented). As now things are, at every Parlament, May our Religion, or the Government, Be innovated, to our greife or shame, According to those Modells they will frame, Who may by frau'd, or other meanes uniust, For such end's, screw into our Publike trust. Sometimes, wee shall be govern'd by a king; A few yeares after, by an other thing; Then, by a king againe; and, to all these Be forced to engage, as others please; With every wind, turn'd like a Weathercock, Now fast, now Loose; out Nettle and in Dock; Yea, and to sweare, till we may safely say And sweare, that, most have sworn their faith away: Which, to prevent, either from God, or him, Who, hath in all Affaires, the Pow'r Supreame Our help must come; and, from a Parlament Which, thereunto shall give a full assent: But, this can never be, (as I have said Elsewhere) until the Ground-worke be new laid; And, till by good and perfect Chymestry, Natures three principles, Salt, Mercury, And Sulphur, be to that just temprature, And such proportion brought, as will procure To govern us, a Civil-Trinity, Made up into a blessed Unity, It self (so far forth as it may be done) Conforming to th'Eternall three-in-one In Righteousness and Mercy. This product, Our selfishness, doth hitherto obstruct; And wil, till God, in some things, hath a choice By Lot, when they are past by humane voice: For, much corruption that wil cure; and, then, Christs kingdom, will begin to be with men More manifest; and, no false Christs appeare As now, and heretofore, they have done here. But, know, that when a Government consists Of three Estates, 't will wrong those Interests Which to a Free Republicke do pertain, Unless it be provided, that, those twain, Which are Superior, shall descend to none By Birthright: But, that, thereto ev'ry one Shall be elected; and, no person bear Such Place, who was not born a Commoner; Or, whose Posterity, shall not return To that Condition, whereto he was born. For, he, or his, will Tyrants be at last By whom, this Proposition is transgrest. These things, perhaps, will come to pass in time, Whereof, I seem at present, but to dream; And, peradventure, we till then, to gain A Setlement, shall plodd, and strive in vain. Meanwhile, his Highness, or he, whosoere God, to the supream Office doth prefer, A Suffrage-negative, should have in that, Which, Publicke safty, doth necessitate To be by him, or them, sometime Denide: By no means, can he otherwise provide To keep his Honor, or, those Dues, which must Preserve him able, to perform his trust, Or bound them in their Orbe, who else, (as we By proof have found) exorbitant may be, And, like a Heard (if not well kept together) When some break out, run all, they know not whether. Nay, till there be a Gouvernment here fixt, Things ballancing, so evenly, betwixt Prince, Peeres, and People, that, each may subsist, And not infringe each others Interest, He, that is our Supream, must trusted be With Arbitray Power in some degree, To carry on his work, and to secure The whole, whilst our unsettlements endure: And, to effect that end, God did, perchance, Destroy the Pow'r, that was; and this advance. Without such Pow'r a Prince chose out of Logs, Like that which was bestowed on the Frogs, Would be as good: Him, we might deal with all As we should please; and any thing might call, And leap about him; till asham'd we be Of such a Block, and chuse a worse then he. This Parlament, hath done what them became In offring; he, hath also done the same In his refusal: And, still to adhere To that whereof resolv'd he doth appear, Shall do as well, until that be removed Which gives Offence, or, Inoffensive proved: And should he be compelled to accept Till that be done, Decorum were not kept. They therefore, as I hope, will qualify That, which he is inforced to deny, (And thereby save the labour and the Cost, VVhich, else, would in an evil time be lost) Rather then force him to an acceptation Of that which would be an abomination Both to himself and others: VVhich would prove No Symptome of their Piety or Love: For, should he be compelled unto that VVhich most of his best Friends abominate, And, his own Conscience cheks at; It would give A Kingdom, which no wise man would receive; And as it were inthrone him, (shall I tell In plain termes where?) ev'n in the Depths of Hell, Within whose cursed bounds, is comprehended A wounded conscience, wilfully offended. It is confest, the Title of a King Is honorable, and may profit bring To some who would confer it; But, to Him No benefit (yea, and perhaps, to Them At last as little) For, if he grow less In Pow'r, that Title, will in his distress Not so much help as hinder: And, then, they Who gave it, will, first, take the same away: Yea, if on that side an advantage grow, They will bestow it on his greatest Foe. But, if his Pow'r continue, he may still Support his Title, call him what you will; And, that, to which none can lay claim but he, Will safest upon all Adventures be. Indeed, all things consider'd well together, There will be Hazards, both in th'one and th'other; But, least in that, which will in proof be best To keep that conscience, which gives Inward rest. Though, in it self, we do confess the Title Is honorable, it can add but little To his Repute: Nay, it will be a blot As things are, to that honour he hath got; Which, if it seriously considered be, Is of a higher nature and degree, Than that which men confer; and, they shall do No more who add a King-ship thereunto, Than he, who Diamonds in Lead doth set, Or, makes an Earl or Duke, a Baronet. And, Gideon, peradventure, did therefore Refuse a Kingship, being honour'd more By what he was, then by what he thereby Might have convey'd to his Posterity. Kingship is lawful; yet, wise men do know Things lawful, inexpedient sometimes grow. The Stile of King, was but an Ordination Of men; and afterward by Toleration, At their request, by God himself allow'd Unto his people (so, that neither proud They did become, nor pufft up with ambition O're others; which, thereof was one Condition.) Yea, 'tis an Attribute of God, whereon Was rais'd, this incommunicable one, The King of Kings. If therefore, at the Name We simply take offence, We are too blame: Or, if we think, the Pow'r they give is less Who, by Synonoma's, the same express, As many Nations do, who never had A King among them, since the world was made, Yet give their Princes pow'r, whereby they may Rule well, and make their Subjects well obey. The Supream Person, always is the same In Soveraignty, whatever him you name: And, they who do pretend, our Lawes to bring Advantages, to him that's call'd a King Which other Titles give not, do well know, If, he be their Supream, it is not so: For, ev'ry thing within our Lawes exprest, Wherein our former Kings had Interest, Is virtually, ev'n by those Lawes, derived To him, who for our Soveraign is receiv'd. And, whatsoever they make shew of, may, Who make the Law, speak what they please to say, Were that, which is now conquerd by our Swords, Brought to their Bars, to be new tri'd by Words, The Judgment would be given on that side Where Pow'r, not where the Kingship did reside, Although the Law spoke for it, and forbad All other Governments: For, Laws are made To speak, too often, not to that good end For which, Law-makers, did them first intend: But, what best makes out their Accommodation, Who take upon them their Interpretation. Else, they could tell you (without my direction) That, he, whom God hath rais'd for our Protection, Had for his Church, and for his Common-weal, The Pow'r he owns, confirm'd on that Appeal They made to God, when that, for which they fought, To Trial, in an Open Field, was brought. Conquest, is by our Law, the utmost Trial That can be had: and He, (without denial) And his Adheres, have right in that respect, To any Title which they will elect: Yea, and may Change, Confirm, or make the Lawes Such, as their Safety, and the Common Cause Shall now require: Provided, it accord With their Trust, for whose sake they drew the Sword; And with those ancient Rights, by God and Nature, Conferr'd upon the Reasonable Creature: Which, if they shall invade, their Swords now worn, Upon Themselves, just vengeance will return: For, that Pow'r, was conferred to provide A form of Government so rectifide, That, neither Prince, nor Peers, nor People might Intrench, hereafter, on each others Right: Yea, (that by what shall be, and what is past, God's purpose might be manifest, at last) It them impowers, to lay down those Foundations, That shall by This, and future Generations Be built upon: In which work, if they should Leave any Arch, or Pillars, rais'd of old, Mis-laid, or Crooked, Rotten, or Mis-wrought, It would, at last, bring all the Pile to nought. And therefore, to this end, oblig'd they are To use their Pow'r with Prudency and care. To this end, Providence, into their hands Let that Pow'r slip, which at this day commands; And they, who meerly for their own ends use it, Are Tyrants, or else Traitors, and abuse it. That, which may of Protectorship be said, Was, long ago, made publique to be weigh'd; (Not without cause, although to many men, It seemed an Impertinency, then) And, as if that had been foreseen, which would Be offer'd now, the Sequel was foretold, Which would ensue on changing of that Title, With other things regarded but a little; Which, to repeat here, were but (in effect) To offer them again to your neglect. New Titles, future Grandeur, do foreshew; The greatest Titles, at the first were New: And, though the Government which we yet have, Was only modellized, but to save From likely ruine, till we strength should get To raise up that, which might be more compleat; You, in this Title no defect can see, If, but Imperial thereto added be, Or, somewhat else, to put a difference 'Twixt This, and that in Nonage of a Prince: And, those additions which do not estrange, But help explain a Title, are no change. What, if his Highness, doth suppose it given (As I believe) by Providence from Heaven? And thinks Himself engag'd, not to neglect That Gift? And what, if for the like respect, His Friends conceiv'd it might be Ominous, Either to Him who owns it, or to Us, Without an urgent cause to change the same For King, or any other Soveraign Name? Should this great Title be rejected for That, which his best affected Friends abhor? And, they, thereby grow jealous. that his heart (Which seem'd inclined to the better part) Had left it for the world, and for those toyes Wherein her foolish Favourites rejoyce? Might not thereon, some Consequence ensue, Which, peradventure, He, or We, might rue? What, if God gave that Title for a Test Of his adherence to that Interest, Which doth concern Christs Kingdom? and to show That if what God conferr'd he shall forgoe (For what the World will offer) he best prizes The things of this World, and his Grace despises? Or what, (if as that Blood, which heretofore Sprinkled the Posts, and Lintels of the doore) God, gave this Title for a difference Betwixt the Kings of Babel, and his Prince? That he may be secur'd, when to destroy Christs foes, he shall that Army here imploy, Which will cast out their flesh, to Beasts and Fowls, To Devils, give their miserable souls? Make, that abominable Scarlet-Whore Their painted Mistress. desolate and poor? And, throw them irrecoverably thither, Where, they shall burn perpetually together? This may be; for, the time is drawing on Wherein, such Executions will be done. And therefore, in his Highness, it implies Much Christian Prudency, that he denies What's offred now; and, he shall be innobl'd Much more thereby, then by those Offers doubl'd, If he persist; Clear Symptoms, he hath given Of good events, by having so long striven Against what, seemingly, doth offer him Things, of most value in the worlds esteem: For, they infer, that he is rais'd above Their Sphere, who on such objects set their love; That, his Promotions, he expects not from The East or West; nor cares for those that come By Oblique Winds: But, most account doth make Of what the World, can neither give nor take. Those Outward Trappings, which make so much show Of what these Nations do on him bestow, Are not on him bestown, but, on the State. The great Allowances, much murmur'd at, Are upon him conferr'd, for their own sakes, Ev'n to secure Themselves: And, them he takes For that intent; because, thereby, he must, And cannot otherwise, perform his Trust. Whereas, if he perceiv'd it would as little Secure the Publike, as their Offer'd Title, And, on his Conscience press, as that will do, I, do believe, he would refuse that, too. Presume I may not, to declare to those Who are in Pow'r, which way, they might compose Their Diffrences; nor have I ought to say, To that End, which, I warrantably may Propound: For, if I had, neither the fear Of those Wits, who, take liberty to jeer, Nor worse things, could affright me; I, have told As much, as I can seasonably unfold: Except this Hint that follows, doth conduce To somewhat, which, may safely be of use. Perhaps, it is Cast in, but to Insnare; Perhaps, to make proof, how inclined you are. Be wary, therefore, how far you proceed Therein; and mind, I warn'd you, to Take heed. Should it offend, I dare not change a Line; For, though I speak, these Arrands are not mine. God, sets before us, this, and that, to chuse, And leav's us free, to Take or to Refuse; And, such markes gives, of what may prove amiss, That, if we chuse not well, the fault's not His. They, who sincerely think, the Stile of King Will to this Commonwealth advantage bring; And, they, who fear it would portend no good The title of Protector to explode, May, if they can agree, joyn them together, And please perhaps, both Parties; perhaps, neither, Till somewhat reconcile them, which, fit Season More likely seems to bring to pass then Reason. These Titles are consistent; and, if that Which is refus'd, be made Subordinate, And this Supream; that it may thereunto Be Vassal, and a kind of Homage do, As conquered; it might be serviceable With less offence, (for ought that I am able To countersay:) for, that wise Legislator Who was preserv'd, by Rushes, from the water, Was call'd a King; and, therewith had the Pow'r Which, constitutes with us, an Emperor, And in that Commonwealth (which was the best) Both Kingly, and Imperial Pow'r possest; Which, if confer'd on him, who governs us, His Title, might be then contrived thus, Or, some such way: On feet, in Verse, it goes But lamely; Therefore, take it here, in Prose. Soveraign Protector, or, Protector Imperial of the Commonwealth of Great Brittain, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland, with the Islands, Territories and Dominions, to them belonging. This, is not Magisterially propos'd, As if thereby all Ruptures would be clos'd; Nor is it my desire, it should so be, Or, not be so; for, it concernes not me. It, almost, into words was thus far brought, E're it was fully formed in my thought; And, slipt out, (as do such things now and then) Rather, to try the mindes of other men, Then to declare my Judgment; which, I give, (VVhen I intend so) in terms positive. But, thus much, I will say; This is by none Yet claymed; neither gives to any one Just cause of Quarrel: Honourable Pow'r Holds forth: Is, by the Law of Conquest our, And, may within our own Realmes, be assum'd, Yet, nothing be undecently presum'd, If we, know by what means, to limite so The Pow'r, which therewith all, we shall bestow, That no offence it gives; nor may produce Pride, Folly, or Oppression by abuse. But, what would follow, should this fanci'd be, It is not in my dim sight, to foresee; And therefore, to be weigh'd by those, I leave it, VVhom it concernes to Offer, &amp; Receive it: To whom (if sought where such things may be known) It shall be, to their satisfaction shown, How far this, or the Title of a King May be assum'd, and no disturbance bring. Powr, though bred Tame, is an unruly beast, Which if it feed much on selfe interest, Growes quickly wild; and every thing commands Except it selfe; yea breaks the strongest Bands, Which once cast off, Restraint it will avoyd, And never more be bound, till 'tis destroyd. Our best course therefore is not to be strugling With Powr (Although it seems upheld by Jugling As well as by good meanes) or to contend With things without us, which War hath no end: But rather to compose and order so All things within us, as we ought to do. For, there we may have Peace (when we have done Our Duties) In externals, there is none: And what we get by Politick Contrivings By Falshood, Force, Dissembling, or Connivings, Doth for the most part, but the more disorder Our mindes; and from our hopes divide us further. Yea, whether our cheife Magistrate, we shall A King hereafter, or Protector call, 'Twill not be much materiall, what the Name Shall be, if all things else be still the same. Nor His, nor our condition will be betterd Whilst we are with those Vanities befetterd, Which to cast off, we lately made a shew: Or, whilst in secret, we do still pursue Our old wayes, and continue, in effect, What we in Circumstances, do reject. Some are perswaded, that the stile of King May be as well assumed, as that Thing Which gives like Power: And so it may, if he A Jehu, or a Jeroboam be, Who, neither conscience makes whom he offends Or scandalizeth, to obtaine his Ends; Or if he use that Power, which is bestowne For publick workes, to bring to passe his owne. But, howsoever, let it be our care Still to performe what our Obligements are: Which are not to engage him unto One Offence, through fear another may be done: Or, to resist the Power we should obey Because it seems by an unlawfull way Acquir'd or kept: For, every Wise man knows Powr, Thrones, and Glorie, are at GOD's dispose. It is by other some not meanly fear'd, Such Powr is by Protectorship conferd, That he may now infring our freedomes more Then any of our Princes heretofore: Which may be likewise true; yet, what GOD gave Wherewith to do him service, he must have To whom he gives it; If he then abuse it, To their wrong, for whose well-fare he should use it, GOD will aveng it: And though he defers That Vengance, (and the Polititian Jeers At such a Vindication) 'twill be paid With Interest, for all the time delay'd, As soone as our Repentance, and those wrongs, Are for that ripened, which to them belongs. These Nations, and their Parlaments, talk much Of Liberties, and Freedomes, as if such To them pertained, now, as they have had. Indeed, there is an Image of them made, Whereby, we, them a little honor'd see Before the People, (as Saul sought to be.) But, of those Priviledges, we have none; Their Glorie is departed; they are gone: We, by no tenure, any claime can lay But Courtesie of England, at this day, To what, by Birth was ours; or unto ought Which we have purchas'd, or for which we fought: And till our supream Magistrate repaires Our Losses; Or, till GOD shall hear our Prayers And cries (if he oppresse us) we shall still No other be, but, Tenants at his Will. Yet is not he in fault; nor is our Case So bad, or in such hazzard as it was. For, if it were not so, it might be worse; And, that which we suppose to be a Curse, May prove a Blessing. Otherwhile, men lose By having all things at their owne dispose; And sometimes gaine by loosing. what was our, Did lately slip into anothers pow'r; Who, thereof taketh (by that forfeiture) But so much, as our Freedomes may secure To us hereafter. VVhen, he seems to wound He doth but lance a soare, to make that sound Which would destroy us: when, unto some cost He puts us, 'tis that all may not be lost. Yea, for our well-fare, he is meanes contriving, When we most wrong him, by a misbeleeving. And doth discharge his Trust (as I beleeve) By doing that, whereof we misconceive. Though he permits us to capitulate With him, as if we did participate In his Powr; suff'ring us to claime and take Those Priviledges, whereby he may make An advantageous use, with least offence, To bring to passe the work of Providence; And to such purposes, is well content To all our just requests, to give assent: Those things, do not to us of right pertain; They are meer Acts of Favor; no remain Of our old freedomes: And, 'twill hazzardize Their Restauration, to think otherwise: For, those Thoughts hindring that compleat submission Which GOD requires, will hinder their fruition, By making us, perhaps, that meanes endeavor To gain them, which will lose them, quite, for ever. In provocations, IS'RAEL did proceed So far, that thereupon GOD had decreed No Ransome from destruction should redeem Their glorious Temple and Jerusalem, But, their submission to a forraigne King. On Us, for our transgressions, GOD doth bring A Judgment somewhat like it: And, before He, will to us our Liberties restore, We must quite lose them, and submit to Him Whome, as (in that respect) we did contemn. And, now, no humane Policy, or Force Can put us into any likely Course Of repossessing them, save that Compliance, VVith which we have been long time at defiance; And, whereto he that should advise, might speed As bad, perhaps, as Jeremiah did VVhen he in vaine, his Countrymen perswaded To fly to him, who had their Land invaded. But, so it must be; and, if to beleeve VVhat must be, may assurance thereof give. Or, if things probable in Reason, may Confirme that, which I now beleeve and say, Our much aversenesse, rather will bring on Then hinder, that which must at last be done. For, we are torne into so many fractions, Growne of so many mindes, by our distractions, (Or Counteractings) ev'ry Party striving To bring to passe things of their own contriving, Al men so apt, whom place of trust, enable For their owne private ends, to scrape and scrable; And every man so jealous, and affraid, Of being to his Opposite betray'd; That, (as the world was, when it first begun) Our Common-wealth, must be the work of One; One, that hath Powr, and, in whome, to agree They, who are most concernd, most likely be. This One, GOD, hath provided to restore All, that our Kings usurped heretofore (Or, our Sins forfeited) And to resetle On us, those blessings, by a stronger Title; (If neither He, nor these divided Nations Shall, willfully, make frustrate their Probations) Though, many are, yet, fearfull that he may In some things, act the quite contrary way. Those Counsels, he hath oft together brought VVhich we in former times, most proper thought For such a Worke; and, much hath taken in, VVhich offerd, by some private bands, hath been; But, both their Ends, and Contributions are So diffring, and from Unitie so far; That, what he hath desired should be done, Lesse perfect seems, then when it was begun. And 'tis not possible their work should be Long-lasting, who, in so few things agree. He, therefore (as in all times past, we finde It hath been done) who, is by GOD designd To change a Government; and, unto whome He alwayes, an Assistant will become, For his owne works; that spirit, must improve VVhich GOD on him conferreth to promove His Undertakeings. Then, resolve he must On what his Conscience judgeth to be just, And by his Pow'r confirm it: else, the Waies Now follow'd, will destroy him, by Delayes. By this Course, and by weighing well those things Which faithfull men, and his experience brings To be consider'd, he himselfe, alone, Shall do that, which will never, else be done; Even he alone, if, he, himself deny (And on that wisdome, and that pow'r rely, Which hitherto, hath carried him along) Shall, for his undertakings, be more strong Then, if he were with all the strength, supplyd And all the wisdome, of the world beside; For, that shall teach him, what advise to chuse: What he must alter, what he must refuse, And what to fix upon; which, will be more His Honour, then his Conquests heretofore; Or, then to leave through future Generations, A Kingship to his seed, o're many Nations. This done; a Parlament well constituted Will crown the work: then, such as are reputed Just Priviledges, will be all restord; Then, they, who now agree not, will accord: Then, will our Lawes, which yet are made a Snare, Have those effects, for which ordaind they were, And, other things, be fairly carried on VVhich, now, in crooked muddy Chanels run. VVee, in this worke of Providence, most heed Those grosse, and oblique Actings, which proceed From mans corruption; and, the deeds of those Whom for false friends, or else, for Open foes VVee do suspect; and, greatly vexed are VVith those misactings, which, in them appear; As if, their failings only, were occasions Of all our losses, and our Preturbations; But, were it well observed, we should find That, those grand-works, which are by GOD design'd, Are no lesse further'd, by our oversights, Our weaknes, follies, and our foes despights, Then by our Virtues, Prudency, or Powr, Or, any suffrings, or good deeds of our; And, thereupon, prepare a way for Peace, By prizing others more, and, our selves lesse. Or, if our Intellectuall eyes could see VVhat GOD hath done, or, what those actings be VVhereby, his finger, doth make manifest VVhat changes, have infringd our interest; VVe, in true meeknesse, would incline unto VVhat he expects, we, should beleeve and do; Then, we should finde, those changes were permitted That, for GOD's, work we might be better fitted; That, his great Love and Justice, might be known; That, our great failings, we, might know, and owne; That, it might give us many Evidences How little trust there is, in earthly Princes, In Parlaments, or, in the best of those Externall things, wherein we trust repose: And, that, we thence may learne, when we have tride Their Trustlesnesse, in whome, we should confide. As sure as, GOD, ten tribes from David rent, And, made Belshazers doome, a president For future times to heed; and, tooke from Saul And other Kings those Kingdomes wherewith al They were indowd: so surely, was the Throne Of our preceding King, by GOD, broke down: So surely, he, who now inthroned sits, VVas raisd by him; and, that if he forgets On what Conditions, he, that grace received, So surely, shall he be againe deprived, Of what he yet injoyes; and be devour'd By that, whereby, he was at first impowr'd. As sure, as Jacobs sons delivered were Into the hands of Nebuchadnezer, Of Eglon, Jabin, Sisera, and those VVho, did on them great Slaveries impose; So certainly, did GOD give up these Lands In former times, into Oppressors hands, Both Temporall, and Ghostly; causing them In various wise, to be from time to time, Either afflicted, eas'd, inthrall'd or freed As to do well, or ill, they did proceed: And, lately, hath powr'd forth his vials here On Preist and People, upon Prince and Peer; Yet, if we grow not better than we be, Far sadder Changes, we may live to see, Because, such Provocations, ours have been, As, in no former ages, have been seen. Mark what I say; and heed what will ensue; For, what I tell you, is, and shal be true. GOD, for their many sins, did justly bring These Nations, into Bondage, to their King: Not to destroy them, as a foe, but rather, Them to correct, as it became a Father. That Pow'r, He, exercis'd not to fulfill GOD's minde, but, to accomplish his owne will; And, did exceed the bounds of his commission, To make them footsteps, up to his ambition. Then, unto GOD they cri'd, and did repent; VVho, thereupon, unto their Parlament Gave all his Power; whereby, they did proceed Against his life, and raigned in his steed. VVhen they were thus in-thron'd, in leiw of giving, Forgiving, disinthralling, and releiving. Their Brethren, by whose hazzards, blood, &amp; treasure, They, of the sov'raigne Power, had gotten seisure; Their Helpers, Friends, and Servants, they forgot, Or (which is worse) them, they regarded not; (Nor in their greatest need, were some of those, So civilly respected as their Foes) Nay more; them they opprest; sleighted their prayers, Exposed them to shame, wants, and despaires; Endeavour'd chiefly their owne exaltations,; Th'inriching of themselves, and their relations; And, had not that succeeded, which befell, What else they would have done, no man can tell. In sight of GOD, of Angels, and of Men, These things were done; and, this, compels my pen To leave it on Record, here to be read By future Ages, when that I am dead. These, and more such like things, which I have been Inforced to have felt, and to have seen, I, from beholding them, long time desir'd My self, into some nook to have retir'd; But, my Engagements alwayes kept me here: Perhaps, that thereof, I might witnesse bear To glorifie GOD's Justice; and to show From whence all our destructive changes flow. And (being that which I seem born to do) With willingnesse, I, now submit thereto, That, to their Faces, I may testify, What, thousands living, know to be no lye. For these Exorbitances, (as this day VVe do perceive) GOD, took their powr away, And gave it to their Servant, whom they sleighted; VVhome, they, perhaps, as ill would have requited, As other men have beene; and, they, are now His servants; and inforc'd themselves to bow Before his presence, whom they did contemn, Till, GOD, had with their power invested him, VVho, is (GOD speed him well) on earths wide stage, The greatest expectation, of, this age: Yet, at his Exit, he, his doome shall beare According, as his part, is acted here. To ev'ry one, of whatsoe'r Degree, Such as his works are, such, his meed shall be: And, this, nor strength, nor wisdome shall prevent; No, not an Army, nor a Parlament, Nor long time, shall Prince, Priest, or People thrive In any thing, they hope for, or contrive, But pussell, plague, and still afflict each other Till they in Righteous-things agree together; And, sanctifie this Commonwealths foundation With much more Justice, and with more compassion. I hope, this downe-right-dealing (which proceeds From Conscience) no Apologizing needs: But, of their wrath, I no whit am afraid To whom, truth, may offensively be said; For, if that any thing thereby befall To me destructive, much more greive I shall For others then my selfe; because, their ends I do foresee, who shall destroy their friends; And, that, if Justice be not more enjoy'd I, shall be safest, when I am destroy'd. Yet, Reader, pleased be before thou goe VVith Candor, to peruse a few Lines moe For my Indempnity and, then I've done; Make no false Comments (prithee) hereupon; Inferre thou not from any word here said, One thought, whereby, aspersions may be laid On that great Councell, by whose prudence, care, Zeale, pains and love, those things proposed are For his assent, without whose approbation, They cannot have Authentick Confirmation. The cause is weighty; and, no Humane eye Can all the wayes of Providence espie. Although their Offers are demur'd upon, They, their devoire, as I believe, have done To give advance unto that Interest, Which, in their Judgement, hath appear'd the best; And done Gods worke, so far forth as they could His purposes, with humane eyes behold; Or, execute his Will, by Reasons light: And, I do hope, they shall (ere that be quite Resolv'd upon, which yet remains to doe) Receive Divine Illumination, too. By that which I have heeded, I conceive (And hold my selfe obliged to believe) That, both they, who did on that Instrument Agree, and also they, who yet dissent, Their Consciences, have with an equal Zeale, To God, their Prince, and to this Commonweale Therein discharg'd; and, that those things which bee Well done, are Best done, when, some disagree: And, that, Truth doth appear in her perfection When she is polished by Contradiction: We, therefore, to both Parties, owe both Love And Civill thanks, what ere the Sequels prove. Believe me herein; and observe, I pray, With heedfulnesse, that which I next shall say; For, it will much concern us: (and I presse This Caution, therefore, with such earnestnesse) When, that which was proposed, once in vain, (And, which is to be offer'd now again Unto his Highnesse) all debates hath past; If then, your Expectations fail at last Which must fall out, on th'one or th'other side; With that, which comes to passe, content abide: And, though in Judgement, you devided be; In your Affections, loveingly agree. If they, who their Proposals lately brought, To be allow'd, obtain not what they sought, Miscensure not of them, as if they had With ill intentions, those Proposals made; Nor judge amisse of him, who gave Deniall; If, when repugnant Reasons have their Triall, He shall be swayed to consent, at length, By Reasons of the most prevailing strength. For, if his Highnesse, on such tearms admit Of that to which he gives deniall, yet, As in his Judgement, and in Conscience too, Well satisfied, in that which he shall doe, And hath beforehand, Gods direction sought, (As I believe, he hath done as he ought) Know, it proceeds from God; and, that what ere We thereupon think Probable, or Feare, We must leave God, and Him, to act their part; Not medling with what's hidden in his heart, Or in an unrevealed Providence, Lest, we to both of these, give just offence; And by prejudicating things unknown, Destroy the Peace of others, and our own. When things are done, (for ought that we can know) As, God, doth unto him his duty show; If, then, we still suspect him, and foment Those Jealousies which nourish discontent; If we shall then imagine his Delay And Scruples, were but onely to make way To new Designes; or, to accomplish that Which, we think he hath alwayes aimed at, (Pretending other things, thereby to gain A Larger Powr then else he should obtain) If we think thus, as I know many do, Because they have been pleas'd to tell me so; Then, there will be no remedy or end Of what we may Injuriously pretend; And, how oblique so e're, his aimes may be, We, make our selves as culpable as he; And, there is somewhat in us, which, no doubt Doth from a Root of bitternesse spring out, That will produce our Shame; or, which is worse, Engage us into some Destructive Course. And, if his heart be right, so much the greater Will our Shame be, as his designes are better Then we believe they are; and, questionlesse, It will to us contract a Guiltinesse, That will bring on a Plague: and manifest That, though against Self-seeking we protest; We, have not so much prayed, that, Gods will Should take effect, as, our own to fulfill. VVhat, of this great Debate will be th'effect, I know not; nor presume I to collect From what I know: for, Princes hearts are deep, And, I, into their secrets will not peep. VVhen Abraham, to sacrifize his Son Exprest a Will, although it were not done, It pleas'd as well; And, GOD, for that proceed, His willingnesse, accepted for the deed. It lies not in our Actions, to fulfill VVhat is requir'd, so much, as in our will: For, two men in one cause may fight (or grinde At one Mill,) yet, but one, acceptance finde; And, what to Act, the Law, on us doth call, Sometimes, by grace, may be dispens'd withall. I, therefore, know not how inlarge we may Or circumscribe his Highnesse in his way; Nor how far, GOD, in this Cause, will allow A dispensation after Tryall now; Nor which way he will bend his heart at last; But, by those things which are already past, (And, by some other symptomes which I finde Of many good performances, behinde) I hope the best: and, since no better way I, can be serviceable; thus, I pray. On Earth, vouchsafe him better things, oh LORD! Then, Justice, can for Mans best works afford. Within the VVorld to come, let him inherit, Not that which He, but, that, which Christ doth merit. And, give him power before he thither goe, To settle righteousnesse and mercy so, Upon his Throne; that, they who now condole May sing a blessed Requiem to his soul; And, that their hopes deferd, may be injoyd, Before, they, or their patience, are destroyd. Our God, hath many wayes to bring about What he hath foreintended to work out. That, which Conditionally to be done He Wils, must take effect in every one As those Conditions are performd by them, To whom, his Offers are propos'd by him; And, that which he hath absolutely Willd, Shall doubtlesse, absolutely be fulfil'd, What ever Contrarieties, here, shall Thereto obstructive, seemingly befall. For my part, therefore, when the Trial's ended, Which, I unfeighnedly have recommended To God, my Prince, and Country; I'le rejoyce More in their chusing, then, in mine owne choyce. Although I suffer by it; with beleefe, It will, at last, produce more joy, then greife. In that Ship, which the common Fraight doth beare, I, am but onely a poore Passenger, Who, moved thereto by an honest zeale, Have spoken, what I thought concernd her weale; And, though I have hereby insisted much On my owne sense; and think it to bee such As may bee own'd; Though, such it be reputed By others, and shall never be refuted; Yea, though, I may discover some things done, By which, my just rights are intrenchd upon; Yet (having done my duty) I will beare Those things with patience, which concluded are; And, not alone submit, to what they doe, My Goods and Person, but, my Reason too: At least so farr forth, that, I will not presse One Argument, by which the common-peace May be indangerd; but, do what I may To serve my Country in a sober way: In silence, things which are amisse deplore; Think my own sinnes deserved that, and more; Mark my own failings; and perswaded be These things have happend, to make proofe of me, And such, as I, as well, as proofe to make Of those who were engaged for our sake: And, praise Cod, though all things be not so well As I desire, that, nothing worse befell. For, from those difficulties and confusions, Which we are in, to draw forth such conclusions As may not be gainsayd, in some repsect, Is more then Human wisdome can effect. The Course by which we purpose to persue Beloved Peace, loathd Discords may renew; And, whilst we fighting are, from Foes to clear Our Vann, we may be routed in the Rear. By those Contrivements, whereby, we suppose To save our Lives, our Honors we may lose. By that, through which our Persons might be free, Our Consciences, perhaps, inslav'd may be; And, what, for present safety, we endeavour, May for the future, ruine us for ever. So finite is our Wisdome, and our Powr, And, those things which may weaken or devour, So infinite; that, we as well may span The Firmament, as, by the wit of Man Contrive, or settle such a Government, As will our dangers every way prevent. For, that which is best done, and best intended, Will still have somewhat in it to be mended: Yea, even the best things, which best men can doe, Insnarings have injected thereinto, To catch themselves, or others; which, none scapes But, he, that alwayes lookes before he leapes; And seekes for Councell and Protection, from That saving-powr, whence all our safeties come. He therefore is injurious, who suspects All deeds ill purpos'd, which have ill effects; Or, who, those Mens Faiths into question cals, Whose Councell under some Aspersion fals: No lesse unjust are they, who froward be Because, he takes his freedome who is free, Yet, takes thereof no more then doth belong Unto himselfe, without his Neighbours wrong: And, they, are not in every poynt so wise As they might be, who, good advice despise (And timely ay'd, when they are like to suffer) Because, that man, whom conscience mooves to offer His services; within the Camp, hath hid Himself, as Eldad, and as Medad did. These things considerd, I, perswaded am That neither I, nor any merits blame, For ought well propos'd: and, that now the day Is near at hand, which will prepare a way To what Good men desire: and, that a deed, Which did from Conscientiousness proceed. Justice and Piety, no bar shall prove, To that which may our Grievances remove. In this hope, I with patience do attend What God will do; to whom, I recommend The perfecting, of what menstrive about, For, hee must do it. Now, this Flash is out. A SPARK. But see, here's of that Flash, a little Spark Yet unextinguish'd; which, I pray you mark. My lifes tenth Clymax is now spent well near, And yet, my warfare is unfinish'd here. I therefore, by this Flash a triall make, How, if need be, Old Powder, fire will take; That when occasion calls mee so to do, I, therewith might discharge a shot or two, Or light a Beacon, timely to Alarm Those, who may by suprizall, suffer harm; And save that, by th'Artillery of words, Which, cannot be secur'd by Guns and Swords. For, though by age, my Arms, are useless found, My Heart so strong remains, my Brain so sound, That both by Action, and by Contemplation, I may, yet, some way serve this Generation; Whose Welfare to promote, I have bestown, More time and cost, then to advance mine own. But, when my heart's broke, &amp; hath crack't my brain, When all those helps, which unto life pertain; When all the present hopes of things without me, (Which to and fro, do flutter yet about me) Are flown away; (as daily 'tis expected) Then, will to mind be brought, things now neglected: And that be done, which, yet, self-love and pride Obstruct; and will, till they be laid aside. Yea, then, with good respect, that will be heard, Which, at this present, hath but small regard. Mean-while, I rest contented with my Lot; For, I have that esteem which others got In former times, who did this way, declare Those Notions, wherewithall inspir'd they were; And, to discharge my duties, am a debter, Though my requitall, never should be better. There lies a little Grain rack'd up within, From whence, my better-being will begin: And, when most Weaknesses appear in me, My Powr, shall then, in full-perfection be: Yea, when I have nor Life, Flesh, Blood, nor Bone, Then, that, which could not by those Tools be done, Shall be performd; and, many things which are Yet dark, will plain, and usefull, then, appear. Mean-while, O God vouchsafe thou to forgive What, hinders their performance, whil'st I live. So prays, Britans Remembrancer. A Cause Allegorically Stated, With an Appeal therein, to all that are wise and honest, from an injurious censure, lately passed. A Goodly Ship, with precious lading fraught, Late, in a dark night, near to land was brought. Through many dangers, and much Blustering weather, The Providence of God, had brought her thither; And, by the Waters motions, and some Humming Among the Shrowds, another storm seem'd coming. The place ariv'd at, was a dangerous Bay, From which, into the Port, two Channells lay, Divided by a Quicksand, with great store Of Shelvs, and Sharp-rocks, upon either Shore: She had a brave Commander, Marchants many; Stout Seamen, Pilots too, as good as any, With Passengers of all sorts; among whom Some could (had need been) have suppli'd the room Of well-experienc'd Sea-men, and advis'd Such things, as Prudence would not have dispis'd. But, these among themselvs, divided were, Through which of these two Channels, they should steer, One party, thinking that the safest way, In which the other, thought most danger lay: And in the dark, it could not well be seen, In which, the greatest Hazzard would have been. There was a poor Old man, that time, a board, To whom, God, had been pleased to afford A faculty, to see things in the dark, Which others could not view, or, did not mark; He, seeing what great straights the Ship was in, And what their loss was likely to have been, Call'd out to those, who there had Chief Commmand, And said; there stands a Rock; here lies a sand, Another yonder, and, a Whirlpool there; Be carefull therefore, thither not to steer; Bear up a little while into the Wind, (Although a shew of danger there you find) And take heed, that a causless fear or doubt, Prevails not now, to make you Tack-about: Lest all be lost, and, you, upon a steep Ridge strike; and, over-set into the deep. Now, by the Starbordside a compass fetch, Halfe way to yon point, to avoyd that Beach; And then, upon the Larbordside again Wheel off, and you the Harbor shall attain. Thus spake the Old man, for although 'twere night, He saw as well, as when the Sun gives light; And then, all they who had a will to see, Saw how to find the way, as well as hee. The greater part, not heeding what they heard, (Nor knowing their own danger) grinn'd and jeer'd; Suppos'd him mad, to talk, and make a shew Of Demonstrations, which they could not view; Crept from the hatches, down into the hold, And let them look unto the Ship that would. But, they, who more sought their own will to have, Then to be counsel'd, or, the Ship to save; Disdaining that an aged doting fool, Should put their Wisedom, as it were, to school; (And, seeing his Relations tend unto, That, which their Captain had resolv'd to do) Grew angry; Therefore, though he neither fears Their wrath, nor much for their disfavour cares; Hereby, he hath appealed unto you, Who, are known honest, wise, goodmen, and true; And, praies you, to be Judges, how he hath, Or wherein, any way deserv'd their Wrath: For, here in brief, his Cause is plainly show'n, And, 'tis to some among you, so well known, That, if you shall condemne him, hee'l submit To make what Satisfaction, you think fit. If this comes forth too late to take effect, My Conscience knows, it was not my neglect: For I, my utmost labour, had bestown, To make it, in a timely-season known. If, therefore, ought amisse thereby ensue, There lay the Fault, to whom the Blame is due. Here being vacant Pages, the Author hath filled them with a Copie of certain Verses, wherewith he lately inclosed two Petitions to the Parlament, and laid them within their Threshold; hoping by that Expedient, they might have been presented to the House; The Paper was thus Superscribed; To that Member of Parlament, who takes up this Paper, with the Petitions inclosed. The Verses are these: Sir, if you are not of this Parlament, Herewith to greet you, 'tis not my intent; But, if a Member of this House you are, Your taking up this Paper (as it were) By Lot, ingageth you to manage those Petitions, which, therewith I did inclose, As, you would have another, use his pow'r, Therein, for your avail, were my case your: Whereof take this Account; and, why I play My Cards refus'd, in this unusual way. Three Parlaments (the eldest of which three, Might, had it pleased our LORD, have out-liv'd me) Are dead and gone, since first I did complain Of Grievances, which hitherto remain Without Redress. I, also have surviv'd To see a Fourth, which hath it self out-liv'd, And may continue, till it hath suppli'd What, Providence, is thereby to provide For needful supplements, to carry on Those Works, which in these Nations are begun. God grant it Pow'r, and Will, and Time, to do What, they by Duty, are oblig'd unto, That, they from wrongs, the wronged may release; Proceed with Honour, and conclude in Peace. To such Atchievments, there's a middle-way, 'Twixt This, and That; 'twixt hast, and long-delay: Which, if mistaken, or not timely found, May (as it hath done) lead into a Round, (Or Labyrinth) whereby, we may be brought To pits and snares, which have no passage out; And multiply distractions, till our prai'rs Are turn'd to indignation, or dispairs: Which, is their drift (and not their least designe) Who, seek this Common-wealth, to undermine. When publick wants, require to be suppl'd, A private plaint may then be laid aside, But, not too long deferr'd, lest it become A festring-soar, not meanly perilsome: For, since an Universal-weal consists Of many Individual Interests, A perfect Body cannot be injoi'd, Where, One by One, the Members are destroi'd; And, when the Eie or Ear, unheedful grows Of what, afflicts the fingers, and the Toes; Much lesse, when it neglects what appertains To keep it, from an Ulcer in the Brains. The cures therefore, of private wants, betwixt Publick transactions, should be intermixt; (At least somtimes) in those immergent things, Wherein, delay of Justice, losses brings Beyond repair; or where the State at last Must bear the dammage, when the cure is past; Or else, in point of honour, suffer more Then all the publick treasure will restore. I grudg not, when GOD's glory is at stake, That they, who conscience of their Votes do make, Should take the freedom to debate at large, What, may their duties in their place discharge; Or, when the Common-safety doth appear In hazard, though my life in danger were: But, when those brunts are over, if men please, For their meer pleasure, profit, or their ease, To leave us in a perishing condition, It, of their faithfulness, may give suspition; And, I more grieve, for what I thereby see May on the publick fall, then falls on mee. There's time enough in all streights whatsoe're, For all things, if it well divided were: And, for our not apportioning aright The time we have (as wisemen see we might) GOD, cuts off half the daies we should have had, And our designments are abortive made. As wee from week to week, from day to day Do put off those, who for our succours pray; So likewise, are our suits and hopes put by, By him, on whose assistance we rely. An hour therefore, should otherwhile be spent, To give Reward, as well as Punishment; To think on them who help us in our sorrow; As well to make repaiments, as to borrow; And, like the Tree that's planted by a spring, Expected fruits, in season, we should bring; Not nine or ten years after they are dead, (Who, by our timely fruit should have been fed) Lest we be felled by the Wood-mans hand, Or, like the Fig-tree, wither where we stand. One day, is as well spar'd sometime, to save An honest-man, as nine to doom a knave; And, of an useful Plant to take due care, As, from the good-corn, to weed out a Tare. Some private acts of Justice, with our zeal To Piety, and to the Publick-weal, (Or works of mercy) sprinkled here and there Among them, like embroid'ries would appear, Or flowers of gold and silver interwove, And helpful be, devotion to improve: For, where few private grievances are heard, God, gives their publick praiers small regard: And, few are in that Common-wealth much joi'd, By which, their own well-being is destroi'd; Or, which is sensless, of their sad estate, Who did help save it, from a sadder fate. Among such suff'rers, I my self am One, Who, gladly would be better thought upon, For your own sakes; who, peradventure, may, Have by my losse, twice mine, another way. As many years as are equivalent To two men's lives, I have already spent To seek for Justice, with such cost, such trouble, And losse of time, as make my losses double: So that if many suits, here, at this rate, I had depending, three times my estate, And three mens lives, would scarce afford me time, And means enough, whereby to finish them: For, my Petitions, either were deferr'd From month to month, from year to year, unheard, Or answer'd so, that when my suit seemd, done, My Case prov'd worse, then when it first begun; And, to obstruct the Justice I emplore, They, voice me to be rich, who make me poor. With mock-shews of relief, I have been fed; with stones, In my distress, instead of bread; Which, had ere this day starv'd me, but that GOD, Turns many of them, into wholsome food; And rais'd me a subsistance, out of that Which was design'd to ruine my estate. His Highness, also stor'd me with a Dish, Which hath converted Scorpions, into Fish: Else, that small portion, which I yet possesse, (And some Envie) had long ago been lesse, (It may be nothing); for, that Act of Grace, Is made lesse valuable, then it was By him intended, of whose free donation It was conferr'd, beyond my expectation. Oh! if that I, who have some friends, thus far'd, How speed poor men, whom no man doth regard? And, who, from none, can claime an obligation, Either by Friendship, Faction, or Relation? But, now, new-misadventures me beset, Which, by delay of Justice, do beget Increasing mischiefs, that admit no cure, Save, what must from a Legislative pow'r, Derived be: And, this befalls me so, Perhaps, that I, in every Change, may know, The gen'ral temper, by the pulse that beats Both in Superiour, and Inferiour seats; That, I, thereby may calculate the length Of our oppressions, and improve my strength To bear them: mark, how well our publick Acts, Ingagements, Orders, Bargains, and Contracts Will be perform'd; and, that, as by presage, Of things that since befell, I told this Age Before they came; so, I, might likewise tell The next Age, what I saw done ill, or well. I many have besought to entertain, And offer my petitions, but, in vain. Now therefore, having with some patience stayd Six months at door, to get my suites, convayd Into this House, where, seeing ev'ry day, New suitors more and more stop up the way, And small signe, that, with any I should meet, To hand them in, I laid them at their feet Who pass in thither; hopeful, that it may, For my inclos'd Petitions make free way, Through those Obstructions, which have shut the gate Against them, till they come almost too late. He, who shall take them up, and get them read, Where, with effect, they may be answered; A Favour shall confer, by doing so, On me, and likewise upon many moe. For, if my suits, obtain respective heed, Some other men, wil hope, as well to speed; And of my wrongs, if no redress I have, Both I, and they much future cost may save. GOD speed it well: for, I, with what event He gives it, am resolv'd, to be content; And, am assur'd, that though I be neglected, By men, I shall of him, be still respected. Britans Remembrancer. A Postscript to the Preceding Verses. They, who to neither Side, nor Back, nor Further; Can turn, or pass, need no Restraints by Order. Nor greatly be afraid what next will come, Their, just resolvings, to divert them from; And, that, whereto necessities compell, Is done excusably, though not done well. If much oppression, cracks a wiseman's brain, Who knows, whereto, it may a fool constrain? They, whom delay of Justice doth make poor, Do lose but their estates, and, may get more: If, therewithall, they are of life depriv'd, They feel not, what to feel, they might have liv'd: But, he who doth in life-time, thereby lose Both wealth and credit, shall to friends and foes Become a scorn; whereat, if mad he be, And, makes ten thousands grow as mad as he, The fault is theirs, who, without mercy, stretch, A weak man's patience, farther then 'twil reach; As if, he, of his suff'ring sense had none, Because, they no more feel it, then a stone. My principle (which makes me oft abus'd) Injoins me, when I scurvily am us'd Where I expect relief, to shew my wrongs; And, vengeance leave, to whom the same belongs; But, some men, cannot be content to stay GOD's leisure, or, for Justice, in his way; And, what, their wants, neglects, and indignation May tempt them to, is worth consideration. There is to all things, an appointed date; And, they are unwise, who are wise too late. Necessitas, &amp; indignatio quid non possunt? FINIS. A Triple Paradox: Affixed to a COUNTER-MURE Raised against the Furious Batteries of Restraint, Slander and Poverty, The three Grand Engines OF The World, the Flesh and the Devil. By Major GEORGE WITHER, Who, now beleagured by their Forces, throws out unto them this DEFIANCE. The said PARADOX maintains these Particulars. That Confinement is more safe than Liberty, Slander more advantageous than Praise, Poverty more profitable than Riches. Nusquam, non potest esse virtuti locus. Seneca. The Author, to all those who have relieved him in his Beleagurement. A Triple Paradox; Wherein are asserted, these particulars, that IMPRISONMENT, is more safe than LIBERTY; SLANDER, more advantageous than PRAISE; POVERTY, more profitable than RICHES. For an INTRODUCTION, the AUTHOR flings this Express to the WORLD. A Parlie, unto thee disdainful WORLD, I found; and have to thee this Paper hurl'd. Yet, neither for a Treaty or Compliance, But, rather, still, to bid to thee Defiance; For, what thou wer't, thou art; and I yet am And will be, whilst I live, to thee the same. Thou art become the Mistress of the Field; Hast me beleaguer'd, summond me to yield My Fortress, and thou so proceedest on, As if thou wert assur'd, it should be wonn: But, thereon thou perhaps, mayst yet attend As long as did th'Infanta for Ostend; And as she nothing had at last but Stones, Get nothing but dead flesh, and rottenbones. I see thine insolence, and every day Hear what thy favourites are pleas'd to say, How they extol thy Power, how they debase My succours, and my helpers would disgrace. I well observe, thou round begirt me hast; That, having all my Outworks quite laid waste, Thou, to compleat a Conquest, dost begin A fierce assault to ruine all within. That, to prevent the sending of supplies, Thou fright'st my friends with slanders and with lies. My Accusatrix too, become thou art; And, justly (I acknowledge) in some part, But, not in all: for, chiefly, thy temptations Inducements were to those prevarications Whereby, my Talents were sometime abus'd: Though therefore, I seem worthily reduc'd To what I am; thou undeservedly Hast me pursued with malignity; Because the love which I once bore to thee Was more, than thou deservedest it should be; Thou most injuriously requited hast That love, which in my youth on thee I plac't; For, though I never totally was thine, Thou had'st (when least) more of me then was mine: And, him, of his right, to whom all was due I robbed then, thy service to pursue. But, he, now gives me grace, thy wiles to hate, And to observe them ere it is too late, That what thou by thy falshoods dost intend, Shall cross thine own Designments in the end. Thou, having into many errors run me, Thought'st by undoing me, to have undone me, But art deceiv'd: for, that which thou hast done Hath brought me to the knowledge of that Stone, Which turneth dross to gold; and from offences Instructs me to extract those Quintessences, Which will preserve my Freedome in all places, Supply all Wants; Convert all my Disgraces To honours; and in every estate, With all things needful, me accommodate. The Devil by thine aid, hath long time sought How, he his ends upon me might have wrought; But, neither Thou nor He, nor both conjoyn'd, Had power to bring to pass what was design'd, Untill the FLESH, my Dalilah, you got To be a third Associate in the Plot; And then, both to her damage, and to mine You, such progression made in your design, That by deluding her, you soon prevail'd, In that, whereof you otherwise had fail'd; So, by her Frailty, more than by your Power, (I, being in your clutches at this hour) Am openly exposed (in some sort) Like Sampson for a while, to make you sport; But, stretched your malignity so far That your own Actings, your own works will mar: For, though my Dalilah your Vassal be, And you by her means have surprized me, Your Cords and Chains will off again be flung, So that, we shall redeemed be ere long From our Captivities, and in conclusion Your own contrivements will be your confusion. When thou pretendedest kindnesses to me (And by them, didst intend to ruine me) Thou gav'st me then, one of Pandora's Boxes, Which, I return thee full of Paradoxes That shall uncharm thy Witchcrafts, and destroy Those Gins which thou against me dost employ: For, if thou open it, (as it is sed Prometheus opened what shee's fabuled To have bestow'd on him) from thence will flow Those Truths, which will thy falshoods overthrow, And make some who admire them, to contemn Those Juglings wherewithall thou foolest them: As likewise all those Bugbear-Tyrannies, Which thy oppressing-Instruments devise To fright us from our duties, and adhere To thy allurements, out of love or fear. To batter down my petty single Sconce, Thy three great'st Engines thou hast rais'd at once, And so surrounded me within my Fort, That, I have scarce one little Sally-port Whereby I may have egress to offend My Foes, or to give ingress to a friend. Thy Ragged Regiment of POVERTY, (And they which by RESTRAINT of LIBERTY, Commanded are) enclose me so about With double Trenches, that, here can to nought For my Relief, admittance now be given, Except it comes immediately from Heaven: Moreover, at the four Winds, raised high, Are four Mounts, whereupon thy Batteries lie So diligently man'd by Major SLANDER (An old and well experienced Commander In such like services) that, several wayes His great Artillery upon me playes. At me perpetually his tongue-shot flies, And his whole Culverings charg'd full with Lies, Send poysoned Bullets, which I often hear, Making loud cracks, or whizzing by mine ear. But, I, at last, shall rout all this Brigade, Quite frustrate those attempts which thou hast made And raise again thy seige, or do as well By dying nobly in my Citadel, And, that it will to thee (when batter'd down) Prove like the House by Sampson overthrown. Then, those things, plainly will to thee appear, Which thou at present, wilt not see nor hear; And I shall be the same to thee and thine, Which thou hast lately been to me and mine; For, then, my Ghost, arrayed in white sheets Shall haunt thy houses, walk about thy streets, And fright thee day and night with repetition Of what is hasting on, for thy perdition, And will descend upon thee at those times Wherein thou fill'st the measure of thy Crimes. Mean while, to comfort others, and prevent The tediousness of my Beleagurement, Ile draw a Map, wherein Ile so express The vanity of thy maliciousness, That, they who list shall know how much I slight Thy Triple-Forces, and contemn thy spight; And I to thee, their weaknesses apart Will so declare, that, unless blind thou art Thou shalt perceive, I cannot be destroy'd, By those whom thou against me hast employ'd Although in one united: for, these three SLANDER, IMPRISONMENT and POVERTY, To fall upon me, all at once began Before, thou didst repute me for a Man; And though they charge me all at once agen, Grown weaker by old age, than I was then, My Helper is the same; and suffring long Hath by his Grace, now made my power more strong. I know thy pride this Confidence contemns: For, faith and hope, are now thought but the dreams Of those men, whom thou dost Phanaticks call: But, whatsoev'r thou thinkst, proceed I shall. And, if thou heedst what follows, thou shalt hear How little, either thee, or thine I fear. With that part of thy Forces Ile begin Which, with the first Trench hath now shut me in. Thou knowst, what outwardly, thou hast bereft; Now, thou shalt know, what is within me left But, never shalt attain to apprehend How far my hidden store-house doth extend. Confinement is more advantageous than Liberty. Restraint, which is an Engine, right or wrong, Made use of, (first, or last, short time or long) By most Oppressors, hath been oft my lot; And, at this present, I escape it not: For, (though not in the ordinary way It feemeth now inflicted) I might say, I am imprisoned, and so confin'd That, I am no way free, except in mind. Of most enjoyments I am quite depriv'd Which from external things may be deriv'd, Yet thereby not undone; for I possess My whole essential Freedome neretheless. My toyes are lost, but by their deprivations I furnish'd am with real consolations, Which, though they to the world-ward make no shows Yield sweeter comforts than the things I lose, And make my hidden Freedoms to be more Than those the world vouchsafed heretofore: For, to her Freedoms, when respect I gave I was then only free to be a slave, Whereas, this, doth from nothing me restrain, Which, to true Liberty, doth appertain. That, which gives most content to flesh and blood I finde to be the basest servitude; And that we nothing have whereof to boast Till what the world calls Liberty is lost. What Freedom want I, save what being had makes many Free-men slaves, and wise men mad? None, have upon themselves, and others, brought More plagues than they have done, who would be thought The freest men: for Freedoms mis-imploy'd Have lately all our Liberties destroy'd; And, most, whom we much reverence as our betters Are but our fellow-slaves in golden fetters. What Liberty had I, whereof to vaunt By those Infranchisements I seem to want? I was at Liberty to rowle in dust, To prosecute my fancies and my lust; And therein joy'd, when I could walk abroad; But, now, I finde the Services of GOD Are Perfectst Freedom. That, I am debarr'd Of nothing, which deserveth my regard; And, that the Liberty I did possess, Was not true Freedom, but Licentiousness; At which experiment I am arriv'd, By losing that whereof I am depriv'd. This (though fore-seen it was) to me befell Before I for it was prepared well, And, I confess, at first it made a change Within me, and without, that seemed strange: But, not long after, at the second sight, That, which appear'd the wrong-side, prov'd the right; And I am well contented therewithall: For, I could see GODS Mercies through the wall; Discern'd, when inwardly, I turn'd mine eyes, Much more of Heaven, than when I saw the skies. And, that, from very little I was barr'd, Which I have reason greatly to regard. What can I see abroad, which hath not been By me before, almost to loathing seen, Or, heard not so describ'd, that being shown It will not seem a thing already known? Both Changes and Rechanges I have view'd; Seen new things old become, old things renew'd; Princes petitioning disdainful Grooms Great Kings dethron'd, &amp; Peasants in their rooms; Laws out-law'd, Out-Laws raised to be Judges Of Laws, Lives, Goods, and of our Priviledges, By Law and Conscience; Loyaltie made Treason, And Treason Loyaltie; Non-sense for Reason Allow'd, and Reason thought irrational: Yea, Meteors I have seen rise, and Stars fall; Foundations that immoveable appear'd Thrown down, and Castles in the Air uprear'd. I have seen Heads and Feet exchange their places, Wealth make men poor, and honour bring disgraces; Beauties, which ravished beholders eyes Wax more deformed than Anatomies, Or, no more lovely to be lookt upon, Than Rawridge, Mumble-crust, or Bloody-bone, But, truth to say, they who most lovely be, Now, no more pleasureful appear to me Than Pictures, nor so much as ugly faces Whose hearts are beautifi'd with inward graces, Although to Beauty very few were more A Servant, than I have been heretofore, And if that please not, which I once lik'd best, What pleasure is there to behold the rest? That, at this present, and all other sights Afford so little which my heart delights, That, all the earth, and one poor little room Are so equivalent to me become, That I know nothing any other where More to be priz'd than my enjoyments here; And, that which makes me so indifferent Nor melancholy is, nor discontent. Confinement, in a house of strength doth dwell, A homely, and sometimes a nasty Cell, In furnitures, and in attendance poor, A Cerberus lies alwayes at the door Fawning a little, when we entring are But ever snarls while we continue there: Yet, I so quickly had found out his diet, That, I knew either how to keep him quiet, Or order so my self, that when I please, I can lye down and sleep in LITTLE-EASE; Enlarge within, that which without hath bound, Contrive conveniences where none I found; And, every whit as much content receive In what I have not, as in what I have. I view not here the pleasures of the fields Or what a Garden, Grove, or Meddow yields Which were of late my daily recreation, But, I have Visions by my contemplation, Which hither, during my Confinement brings Not only sights of more essential things But an assurance of enjoyments too, Whereof I doubted more a while ago. I could not be at that Solemnization Which honoured my Soveraigns Coronation, Nor saw his Royal Train in their late Marches Through LONDON, under their Triumphant Arches; Yet in my solitariness, alone, What they were doing, I did think upon, With what should else be done, that's not done yet And, which I wish we may not quite forget, Nor so long, that there, may at length be lost Much real honour, and no little cost; And which, perhaps, to bring now into mind By this expression, I am thus confin'd; For Providence, did neither me restrain At this time, nor infuse these thoughts in vain. Ionick, Dorick, and Corinthians works, In which, an Architectors cunning lurks Apart, or inter-wove (with that apply'd Whereby it may be richly beautifi'd) I can conceive, as if I saw it made, And all which paintings thereunto can add. I know, as well as they who did behold That costly Show, what Silver, Silk and Gold, Pearls, Diamonds, and precious Rubies, can Contribute to adorn a horse or man. I have seen all materials which were thither, To make up that great triumph, brought together. Princes and Dukes, and Marquesses and Earls, Plebeians, Men and Women, Boyes and Girls, As many thousands as then present were I did as well imagine to be there As if I them had seen; and can suppose Not only what is acted at such Shows, But also, more than was at any one Since first the Roman Triumphs were begun, And fancy by my self such glorious things As would quite beggar Emperors and Kings To represent them. So, by being there I had but seen a meaner Show than here My fancy could have made; and what had I Been then, I pray, advantaged thereby? What had I gained then, by sitting long And paying, to be crowded in a throng? What great contentment could I have deriv'd From what Mechanick Artists had contriv'd, Compar'd to that which my imagination Contriv'd in honour of that Coronation? At which the Trophies cost, at most, no more Than would have made some needy persons poor? I seldom took, at any time much pleasure In Shows, which ev'ry vulgar eye can measure; And time and cost require to make them gay, Yet in a moment vanish quite away, Behinde them leaving nothing that conduces To Pious, Moral, or to Civil uses. What though I did not see the King that day? I did in my Confinement, for him pray As heartily as any person there, And, GOD, perhaps, assoon the same will hear, Although my Tongue was not then heard among Those Acclamations of the vulgar throng, Which did salute his ear; my silent Voice Wing'd with Devotion (though it made no noise) Ascended Heav'n, and may bring blessings down, Which will conduce to setling of his Crown, If he unfix it not by mis-endeavour, Or, valuing of the Gift more than the Giver. I do presume his duties on that day He did discharge; and (wishing others may Perform their dues to him) do not envy The glory of that day's Solemnity To him, for whom 'twas purpos'd, nor the sight, Thereof, to those who took therein delight; But wish'd, both might be perfectly contented In what was at that present represented; And hope, nought was to him ascribed then, Which rather appertains to GOD than Men: For, when to Hereds eloquent Orations The people gave blasphemous Acclamations, And he that honour to himself apply'd, Whereby, GOD ought to have been glorifi'd, The Doom, which that offence did on him bring, Made him a lifeless, and a louzie King. Of these things my confinement did produce Some thoughts, which are perhaps of some good use. I, likewise exercis'd my Meditation, That day, on other things which have relation To what was then in act; and mus'd upon That, which occasion gave of things then done, On some now past, and upon other some Which probably will be in time to come. I mus'd upon the Changes, and the Chances, The Publick Troubles, and Deliverances Which I have seen. I seriously did ponder GODS, and Mens actions joyntly and asunder; Our foolish Projects, his wise Providences, Both in their Progress, and their Consequences. I thought both on the People and the King, What good or evil possibly might spring From their deportments towards one another Now by GODS mercy they are brought together. On those too, in particular, I thought Whom, GOD into his power hath lately brought: How great, erewhile, his wants and sufferings were, What, his enjoyments at this present are; And, on some other matters, not a few, Which these, to my consideration drew, And which perhaps, that day had been by none Mus'd on, so much, had I not been alone. Moreover it occasion'd thoughts of that Which to a Nobler Object doth relate; Even to that Kingdom, King, and Coronation, That should be thought on with more veneration Than all the Monarchs in their greatest glory, Who now live, or are memoriz'd in story. My Contemplation, with as much content, As others had, to me did represent That DAY wherein CHRIST through Jerusalem Rode meekly on an Ass, whilst after him The people throng'd or laqued by his side, And voluntarily HOSANNA cry'd, Yet afterward pursuing him with scorns Cry'd Crucifie, and crowned him with Thorns; And this, me thought, was so considerable, That it made all our Pomp seem defpicable. For, then my Muses drew me by degrees, To meditate on what my soul fore-sees Concerning them, who, whilst they do pretend CHRIST's Kingdom, do pursue another end; And that, which for his glory was bestown, Make use of, for advancement of their own. Not seldom, likewise, I then thought upon Those many thousand families undone, Who sit and weep through want of what that day Was wastfully and vainly, thrown away, At such a time, wherein both Man and GOD, Proceedings lookt for in another mode, And when, our publick hazards and distress, Requir'd another way of thankfulness. Upon that solemn day, (not without wonder) I saw and heard, the Lightning, rain, and thunder Wherewith GOD seem'd to answer and out-vy Our Guns and fire-Works, (though I was not nigh) And such resemblance had the works of Art, To Nature's, that they could not be apart Distinguish'd; but that, to prevent our error, The last was loudest, and infus'd more terrour. This, I observed well; and furthermore Took special heed, that nigh two Moneths before, And likewise ever since, from Rainy weather We were not oft free, one whole day together, Until that Royal Triumph was begun, Nor till that moment wherein it was done: Yet, durst I not be so prophane, to say (As one hath writ) it dar'd not rain that day. Nor at that time, Flaminian like, durst I Conjecture by a Heathenish Augurie What GOD thereby intended: but, with awe Consider'd upon what I heard and saw: And I confess the Lightning, Rain, and Thunder At this our Seed-time, caused me to ponder On that, which Sumuel prayed GOD to send In Harvest-time, and what that did portend; Which I conceive to be a Meditation Not then improper, for my Contemplation. And, though some peradventure may suspect That these expressions, may some way reflect On what concerns them, it concerns him more Whose cause and honour I prefer before All earthly things; and can be not afraid, Who ere shall be displeas'd with what I've said; For, I was barr'd from seeing what is done By men; that, GODS works might be mused on. Such things, although we then much mind them not, Should not amidst our Triumphs be forgot; And, that, (which then by me was thought upon) Much more effectually, perhaps, was done In this condition which I now am in, Than could in that state, wherein I have been: Forgot therefore, by others, if it be It will seem no great wonderment to me; For, who remember Josephs in their sports, Or in the jollities at Princes Courts? Confinement (which I once a damage thought) To me, hath other priviledges brought. It manifests apparently to me Who are my Kinsmen, who my Neighbours be; And whether he who passeth by me than, Be Levite, Priest, or a Samaritan: For, Neighbourhood and Kindred, he best tryes That's robbed, wounded, or, imprison'd lyes. In Liberty, I sometimes doubted whether They, who then came to visit me, were either My Friends or Foes, for, I found other while They whom I trusted most, did most beguile. But, few or none my Visitants now are Save they, whose Visitations are sincere; The Friends I got, when I did walk abroad I gain'd my self: These, are made mine by GOD. These were acquired without pains or cost; Not won by merit, nor by small faults lost. The first, were for prosperity decreed, The latter, for my help, in time of need, And sought my Body out, unknown before Because, they heard it was distrest, and poor; Which hath to me, Confinement sweeter made, Than all the Freedoms which I lately had; And, me, with that Communion of the Saints, Experimentally, it now acquaints, Which, in this life enjoyed is, by all, Who, in the life to come, enjoy it shall. A Prison, cannot dreadful seem to me, For, there I first was taught my A, B, C, In Sufferings: There, when I had scarcely past Mine Nonage, to be schooled I was place't. And, so long as the Providence of GOD, Was pleas'd, that, to instruct me with that Rod, I should continue my abiding there. Princes, my Tutors, and Correctors were. A Prison, is that House of Discipline, Wherein the MARTYRS usually begin To be Probationers; it is the Colledge Of SAINTS, wherein experimental knowledge Is first acquired by a carnal sense Of that, which tries their Christian patience. Prisons, to them, are sanctified Temples, Wherein, they by their meekness and examples Preach to the world by Deeds (a powerful way) What, many other do but meerly say. And, as our Prelates, in each Cathedral Have several places, which they please to call More or less holy: so, there likewise be Imprisonments of differing degree: The Outer-ward, an entertainment gives Most commonly to Murtherers and Thieves, Or, such like malefactors, who displease The world sometimes, and interrupt her ease, For which they are confin'd, till their just guerdon They shall receive, or bribe her for a pardon; And whereto she gives all advantages That may in Prisons granted be to these. But, all her Prisoners are not confin'd To Wards, and Receptacles of one kind. The Inner-wards, which do to me appear The same that Chancels unto Churches are, Are not made use of (except now and then) But for most holy and Religious men. The deepest Dungeons be reserv'd for those Who dare our Vices, or her Lusts oppose; Or, things repugnant to our ends profess, (When mov'd thereto by conscientiousness) And, whosoere presumes to plead their cases, As Innocents, doth hazard in like places His own Restraint; or else unto suspects, Which peradventure may have worse effects. Yet, Freedom yields to none so much content, As these enjoy, by such Imprisonment. For, they with inward comforts are delighted, Whilst they with outward darkness are benighted: And sweet Refreshments, in amongst them come When they are throng'd up in a nasty Room. When, they of their familiars are depriv'd, They are by those, who knew them not, reliev'd; When they from earthly men, fast lockt have been, Celestial Angels have sometime broke in; Knockt off their chains; the gates and doors unbar'd The Prison shook; the sturdy Jaylor scarr'd And made him (falling down before them too) Cry, Men and Brethren, say, what shall we do? A Prison is the best retiring Room That can be got; the best Museolum For him, wherein to contemplate, that would Those Objects without fallacy behold, Which most concern him; or would notions have Of what he ought to do, hope or believe; For, most of those things, which abroad he spies, Either delude his ears, or blind his eyes, Pervert his Judgement, or withdraw his mind From that, wherein his welfare he might find. A Prison is a place; which he that can Make use of, as becomes a prudent man, Findes there, more lasting, and more perfect solace Than in the greatest earthly Princes Pallace; And, when he knows what Priviledges are In this condition, will scorn all that's there. In Prison, quickly, understand he shall The worst that can to him, at last, befall. There, he may notice take, how most men pother Themselves; what plagues they are unto each other. How, causelesly men terrified are By those, to whom they dreadful would appear; And, peradventure, if they patient be That, they pursued by their Foes will see, By which their self-destruction shall be wrought, And those freed, whom, they into bondage brought. There, they may learn, that to make black or white, One hair, or add one straws-breadth to their height Care nought avails; and in that poor estate To laugh at all the worlds despight and hate: For, over them, no power then left she hath, Except of prosecuting them to death, Which them ten thousand fold will happier make Than all, that she can either give or take. These are such benefits as I enjoy, By what, now seems my Freedom to destroy. In Prison, too, this Priviledge I have, That, living, I descend into my Grave, And by my Contemplation can fore-see What my condition in that place will be. I search it to the bottom, by that spark Of Light, which shineth brightest in the dark. The terrours of that Dungeon I fore-stall, I, (as it were) pre-act my Funeral, And in a manner also, see and hear What will be said and done, when I am there; Which are advantages not to be known, Whilst in the world I flutter up and down. In Prison also, when least room I have, And close am kept, I, far beyond the Grave Do Prospects view; and can see pretty well What may concern men, both in Heaven and Hell; Whereof, if here I should my knowledge speak Them, for Phanatick dreams, the world would take; And not believe the things I could declare, Because, she knows that I was never there; And, therefore, Ile proceed again to show What, my Experiments are here below. Restraint, from me, hath totally shut out That frivelous, and that offensive Rout, Which interrupts my Musings with discourse That's either wholly vain, or somewhat worse: For, to nought else, it for the most part tends But fruitless complements, or graceless ends; And, what among us, is at meetings blown, Wrongs other mens affairs, or else our own, Whereas, our words whilst here we are together, Tend to the edifying of each other, In Faith or Manners; or else, to improve That Hope, that Meekness, Constancy and Love Which may enable, patiently to bear Those Burthens, wherewith we oppressed are: And, when our Bodies are asunder gone, We never leave each other quite alone; For, we (ev'n when corporeally apart) Are present, both in Spirit and in Heart. Though this Fraternity did often minde me, Till my Imprisonment they could not finde me, Nor did I know their persons. Thou, therefore Oh foolish world, to my content add'st more By my Restraint, than if to me were given All carnal Freedoms on this side of Heaven; And, if this be the great'st harms thou canst do, Prethee, let every spight thou dost be two. But, all the comforts which best friends afford, (As they are men) may prove like Jonah's Gourd, For, as next morning, that, did wither quite Which GOD did cause to spring up in one night, So, when the Sun burns, or a sharp wind blows, This may as quickly fade, as it arose: For, Death or Injuries, do every day Take those mens lives, or, their estates away Who are most charitable, and, of bread They may have need, by whom I have been fed, For, unto all men underneath the Sun That may betide which doth befall to one. Not therefore, upon those things which GOD sends, But, on himself alone, my soul depends: Here, all my confidence, vain world, is place't, Or else I might be ruined at last; And all my present hopes, as vain would be, As if I had repos'd my trust in thee. By this Restriction, not a few temptations Will be repelled; many deviations Of mine prevented; duties better done; Things which have been forgot, more thought upon; It peradventure may prepare me too, For what I'm yet to suffer and to do, Much better than that Freedom did, or could, Which, by the Common Tenure I did hold: And who knows, but some corporal mis-hap I may or did by this Restraint escape, Which might have else befell me when together The people throng'd and trod upon each other. Which, though no more but shunning so much harm, As breaking of a neck, a legg, or arm, Were considerable, and ten to one Such mis-adventures daily fall upon Some persons unconfin'd, when they least dread them, Because, where dangers are, they little heed them. Scap'd I no more here, than that flavish load Of Complementings, wherewithall abroad Men tire themselves, and others; that, alone Sufficient were, if well consider'd on, To make amends for all the sufferings Which my confinement now upon me brings. For, as to pay this life, I am a debter To Nature, and then hope to have a better, My Wants, Restraints, and Poverty do less Afflict my Body, by all that distress Now laid upon it, than my soul hath been To hear and see, what I have heard and seen, Whilest I had liberty abroad to go, And hear and see, what many say and do: With what dissembling Complements, Caresses, Affected Speeches, flattering Addresses, And false Pretendings, men of ev'ry sort Do cheat, fool, claw, and one another court, As if they did Realities intend When, in meer Nullities, at last they end. How, Letters, Promises, Vows, Declarations, Orders, Oaths, Covenants, and Protestations Annihilated are, and turn to smoak Or stinks, which rather poison us, and choak Than truly nourish; and how they go on In acting still, such things as they have done Who are destroyed; and yet, nere the less, Dream they pursue the waies of Happiness. I am, as well pleas'd, with my sad condition, As others, with what they have in fruition, And, if desire a longer life I could, For nothing else the same desire I should, Except it were that I might live to see What GOD will do, and what their end will be. Frequent I cannot, with conveniency (As lately, when I had my Liberty, I might have done) the Publick Congregation; But, I, upon GOD's Word, by meditation, (To exercise my self) may set apart The time they dedicate; and both my heart And my best Faculties, employ that day, In preaching somewhat to the world my way Which will advance GOD's glory, and improve My Brethren in good life, hope, faith, and love: Or, that prepare, which thereunto may tend, When Daies and Times, with me will have an end: And, GOD (I know) confines not Saving Graces To ordinary Means, Forms, Times, or Places, Nor is displeased when his services Endeavour'd are, without contentiousness, As we are able, and with upright heart, Though of our duties we may fail in part. Some other Notions, which in this estate Are apprehended, I might now relate, Which further may illustrate those mis-haps That man by an Imprisonment escapes But, they are Trifles to what I possess, In my constrained Solitariness. For, though it be not what I might have chose (Had I been left unto mine own dispose) It proves much better: and for that respect What I most naturally do affect I dare not absolutely to request, (Much less make choice of) but to him that best Knows what's best for me, wholly have resign'd Both mine own self, and things of ev'ry kind. 'Tis he, who hath assign'd this lot, and all What ere it be, which thereby doth befall; And, this Restraint, not only makes him dearer To me, but also, to him, draws me nearer, So that the more my troubles do increase, The nearer unto him is my access. He, fortifies my confidence in him, And heartens me, the World thus to contemn, As boldly as if doubtless cause there were For her to fear me, more than I fear her. I have my fears, but they are nothing else Save what Perdues and Scouts, and Centinels Are to an Army: they do not dis-heart A valiant Souldier; though they make him start At first Alarm; but cause him to prepare For those assaults, which nigh approaching are. When I am judged, in an undone-case, Because, confin'd, in wants, and in distress; When all my outward Comforters are gone, And, I lie musing on my bed alone Of what I knew before, or heard that day; Of what my Friends fear, and my Foes do say; What men they are, who seem with me offended, What is already done, and what intended; Sometimes a little shuddring doth begin, As if a panick-fear were breaking in, Which he marks, ere to me it doth appear Forthwith, steps down betwixt me and that fear Supplies defects, expelleth doubts and sadness, Replenisheth my heart with sober gladness, About me sets his Angels, watch to keep, And (as to his beloved) gives me fleep. These things considered, Prisons and Restraints (Which have been long, the portion of the Saints) Are not alone things little to be fear'd, But also many times to be preferr'd Before those Liberties, and all those things That can be found in Palaces of Kings; What ere their flatterers are pleas'd to say, By fruitless hopes, to drive their fears away. For, more are there endanger'd, more destroy'd: There, many times, is less content enjoy'd, Less outward safety, and a great deal less Of what conduceth to true happiness, Than in a Prison: And who ere well heeds What, there is done, and what thereon succeeds Will finde cause, their condition to bewail Sometimes, much more, than his that's in a Gaol. For, errors flowing from Prosperity Indanger more, because unseen they lie. Men many by their Afflictions be prepar'd For whatsoere can follow afterward, And are oft fitted by a lingring grief, For future happiness in death or life: But, while corrupted by excessive Treasures, Befool'd with honours, and bewitch'd with pleasures, The cause of self-destruction still they nourish; They grow as brutish as the beasts that perish; And, daily so besotted, by degrees That, sense of their humanity they leese; So long dream, they are GOD's (or somewhat greater,) Till they are Devils, or but little better; And suddenly, when they think all goes well, Sink from supposed Happiness to HELL. Most men, (yea very many of the best) Their Talents, till they Palm-like down are prest, Improve not; nor their Duties truly do, Till by Afflictions they are whipt thereto. A Prison, was long time the School, wherein Chast Joseph those progressions did begin, Which, him forth from obscurity did bring To be the second person to a King. Jonas was not obedient to GOD'S Call Till he, both by a Storm, and by a Whale, Was disciplin'd: And, if I had a thought My duties were performed as they ought In any thing, affirmed it should be That, thereto my Afflictions fitted me: For, such like Simples, as I am, require To make them yield forth Oyl, the Press, or Fire, My Flinty-nature gives not out one spark To light my self, or others in the dark, Till knockt with Steel. This knowledge I have gain'd Of mine own temper, and it is unfain'd. To be imprison'd, slander'd, or made poor, Shall therefore, henceforth, frighten me no more, Nor make me, whilst I live asham'd of either Of those three Lots, nor of them altogether. Priests, Prophets, Kings and Saints, yea (whilst abode He made on earth) the glorious Son of GOD Was pleased to submit to all of them (But to the latter two in an extream) And, with such Company, Ile undergo My share, and think, I'm thereby honour'd too. To this effect, much more might here be said, But, this will be sufficient, if well weigh'd, Which, I suspect; for, very few men heed, Or mind, long, what they hear, or what they read. SLANDER is more Beneficiall than PRAISE. Who, can express the pain of being stung With such a fiery Serpent as the TONGUE? Or, what can cure it, but his being ey'd, Whom, once, the Brazen Serpent typifi'd? 'Tis far more sharp than Arrows, Darts or Spears; Down to the heart, it pierces through the ears; Not only wounds, but frighteth also more Than murthring Canons, when they loudest roar; Afflicteth us, whilst here we draw our breath, And, Gangreeve-like, so spreadeth after death (Ev'n to posterity upon our Names) That it destroys the life of honest Fames. This fury SLANDER, hath been quarter'd long, In Rotten-Row, and Hart-street, at the Tongue; Her Magazeens and Forges are all there, The Shop at which she vents them, is the Ear, In ev'ry Town and City; and no places Or persons, her aspersions and disgraces Can long avoid: For, ev'ry where she scatters That shot wherewith the Forts of Fame she batters. So venemous it is, that every touch Proves mortal, or indangers very much, And nothing shooteth more impoysoned pellets, Except it be the flatteries of Prelates. I must confess, that many years ago I therewith have been often wounded so That, very well, content I could have been To lye down, where I might no more be seen; And, my stupidity is not, yet, such As not to feel indignities as much As any man: But, I have learned how To change my Sicknesses to Physick, now: And when the world intendeth me a shame By retroversion to convert the same To that, which from bespattrings purifies, And makes me both her Blame and Praise despise, No more displeas'd, or pleased therewithall Than if a whibling Cur, should fawn or bawl. For, unto those Oppressions, heretofore And now lay'd on me, whatsoever more The world shall add; though they a while oppress, Will, shortly, make them, not alone much less But, also none at all; and wheel about Upon her self, as soon as my Turn's out. Praise, is a pleasing thing, to flesh and blood, Yet, often doth it much more harm than good; Puffs up with Pride, ore-weening and vain glory. Or, with affection to things transitory Beyond a safe Mean; and makes men suppose Themselves to be, what ev'ry neighbour knows They are not; yea, what they themselves do see They neither are, nor possibly can be. Whereas, to be without a cause despis'd, Disprais'd, reproach'd, scoft, jeer'd and scandaliz'd, An undue self-opinion doth remove True Meekness and Humility improve; Brings Constancy and Patience to their tryal, And, at the last, to such a Self-denial, As in the close will more contentment give us Than all, whereof a Slander can deprive us. The flatteries of his Lords, made Joash stumble, Reviling speeches, made King David humble, Good men, by praises, oft, are evil made, But, by Reproaches harm they never had. The World, which best is pleas'd with her own baubles For that false titulary honor scrabbles, Which is compos'd of aiery Attributes, Or, which opinion only constitutes: And, all her happiness, dependant seems On vulgar approbations and esteems, Which are, indeed, her Portion: but, to those, Who can look both beyond, and through the Shows, That such Toies make, nought therein doth appear To merit their desire, love, hate or fear: And, therefore, they respect them, (come, or go) As Reason them obliges thereunto, Or, as things, which (if grace divine be granted) Indifferently, may be possest or wanted; Make such use as they serve to, whilst they have them, And yield them, when resum'd, to those who gave them. For, had external honours in this place, Been truly more essential than disgrace, To happiness eternal; CHRIST had waved The scandals of the Cross; we had been saved And sanctifi'd should be without those troubles, Scorns and reproaches, which the world now doubles And may redouble: yea, in vain had he A promise made, that they should blessed be Who in his sufferings do with him partake, And are reproach'd and slander'd for his sake. These things consider'd, I am at full rest; Slanders infringe not my chief interest. Good or Ill words will me no more concern When I am dead, than when I was unborn. And, whilst I live, (as is inferr'd before) They harm a little, and they profit more. If Scandals neither mend nor mar my health, Increase not troubles, nor decrease my wealth, Save in opinion onely; all those losses Are cur'd, if my vote, that opinion crosses. And (prate who list) I will as merry bee As is a Pye upon a Cherry-tree. Praise, or dispraises, if so be my heart Assures, that neither of them by desert To mee belongs, my own Phanatick brain Is cause of all, whereof I do complain, Or take delight in: praise, blame, bless, or curse, I am no whit the better, or the worse; And, all men are as much concern'd as I In what's then spoken, be it Truth, or Lye. If of a hundred Crimes I guilty were, All which, as evidently did appear, As in a cloudless day, the Sun at noon; The world, but as the spots within the Moon, Would look upon them, if, for my defence I have a face well braz'd with impudence; An Oily Tongue, a Crocodiles moist eye, Can finde great Friends, bribe, flatter, fawn and lye, Ore-awe my neighbours, or, my self express A friend to them, in their licentiousnesse. But, were I, both in words and deeds, as free From just reproof, as mortal man may be, Had I, but one great neighbour, who envies All men suppos'd more honest, or more wise, Than hee is thought; therewith a neighbourhood, Which take delight in nothing that is good; Abhorring all, as their injurious foes, Who, them, in their unrighteous waies oppose; Or, if I be constrained to have dealing, With such, by some relation, or nigh dwelling, Who think, there's nothing rational or just, But, what tends to their profit, or their lust; It is impossible to scape the wrongs Of wicked hands, or of malicious tongues: And, therefore, he, with whom it thus doth fare Must study patience, how his lot to bear; And in this case, can look for no defence But from GODS Justice, and his Innocence, Which is sufficient unto them that know What consolations from those fountains flow. What, is there to be fear'd in Slandrous Tales, Whether, they shall be either true or false? A false Report more mischieves those who spread it, Than harmeth me. If it impairs my credit, I may recover it again ere long, And also peradventure, by that wrong Improve some Vertue, or abate some Pride, Within my self till that time, unespy'd. Although hard words, give harder knocks than stones, And crack our Credits, yet, they break no Bones; And, if unjustly thrown, by spightful fingers, They prove most mischievous unto their flingers. One fault which Conscience findes, afflicts me more Than twenty slanders, yea than twenty score: So long as that lyes quietly in me, I shall not care who my Accusers be; And, when that shall accuse me (as sometime It doth) I sue out an Appeal to him Who straight acquits me; else I must confess I should as much fear mine own Righteousness As all my Sins; for, I esteem them both Alike impure, and as a menstruous cloath. If I am justly blam'd for things misdone, Or, for faults wherein I am going on, It doth by bringing on me shame of face, Repentance bring, and to that state of Grace From which I falling was; and stay the course Which might have drawn me on from bad to worse, Until, that by habituated sin, Endless Impenitency had broke in: Much more, therefore, to these I am a debter Who speak ill, than to those men who speak better Than I deserve: And, though that in their ends They differ, they may be as useful friends Who speak of me opprobriously, sometimes, As they, who praise me, or excuse my crimes. For, I have long observ'd that all Relations, Nigh or far off (what ever Obligations Have nearly joyned them, or whatsoere Their Quarrels, Bonds, or Disobligements are) Be (for the most part) either friends or foes, But, as a prosp'rous, or a cross wind blows; Or, as their inter'st or Expectancy May be secur'd, or doth at hazzard lye. The Love or Hatred, which I finde in them, Differs but in the Measure, or the Time, Or, in th'Occasions, which have them inclin'd, To friendliness, or else to be unkinde. They frown or smile, they praise, or they disgrace, Destroy and save, and stab, or else imbrace, Even as the fit which comes upon them, takes them, And either pleased, or displeased makes them. Such will their words and deeds be then to thee, What ere thou art to them, or they to thee. As bitter Language, I have heard 'twixt those That were dear Lovers, as 'twixt greatest Foes, Yea, and more bitter too, in some respects Considering their Causes and Effects. A Foes Revilings very sharp appear, But, when our Friends exasperated are With, or without Cause given of offence, There is between them greater difference (Or at the least, but very little less) Than tasted is between the bitterness Of unpeel'd Wallnut-kernels, and strong Gall, VVhen with our tongues distinguish them we shall. Moreover, I have sometimes also seen That, they, who have unto each other been Most mischievous, so reconcil'd together (Though little vertue hath appear'd in either) So kind in words and deeds, for outward ends, And, so ingaged mutually as friends In their Concernments, as if they had never At variance been; but, hearty friends for ever. VVhich, when I mind, I neither pleasure have In Praises, nor do slanders me bereave Of much content, from whom soe're they come, So long as I finde Innocence at home; Nor, in my own respect at any time, So griev'd am I, as otherwhile for them VVho have mis-censur'd me; because I know From what distempers usually they flow; And that the sob'rest and the wisest men Have some Deliriums on them now and then. Exception is not alwayes to be took By what shall by a Friend or Foe be spoke: For, men in passion, whether they appear. Pleas'd or displeas'd, speak few things as they are, Nor alwayes as they think, but, rather say That, which the passion bearing then chief sway Transports them to; although a wound it give To their own souls, which pains them whilst they live. But, Friends and Foes, both good and ill report, And all terrestrial things of every sort, VVill shortly have an end (with me at least.) The worst, as well as that whereof the best Esteem I had, will into nothing fly: My Slanders, and my Slanderers will dye. At present, therefore them no more I dread Than if I saw they were already dead; And, that which dead or living, shall to me Befall, will equally forgotten be. By living, I, their scandals may out-live, And good proofs of my innocency give. VVhen I am dead, what ever men shall please To speak or do, it cannot me disease: And, they who after death do men defame, Or shall expose their bodies unto shame, Bring that dishonour which they did intend To others, on themselves, at latter end: Yea, make some question, and suspect their merits; Repute them persons of ignoble spirits; And, what they hoped should confirm their peace, Their terrours and their dangers will increase. Slanders (though poyson in themselves) have been To me a precious Antidote for sin, Preventing, not a few times more than one, That, wherein else perhaps I had mis-done, (And I, thereby, effects like his have found Who had a Sickness cured by a wound) Whereas, contrariwise, a vain Applause Of sins or follies, are a frequent cause. I well remember, that, when I was young (And in both kinds an Object of the Tongue, As now I am) I reaped, many wayes, By Slanders, much more profit than by Praise. For, Praises made me sometimes over-ween, And (as if no defects in me had been) Neglect the means, that, supplements might add To what, I more in Show, than Substance had. It, likewise, me to envy did expose, From which great disadvantages arose, And scandals, without cause: But Grace divine Cross'd thereby, what the Devil did design: For, Defamation, so soon was begun, That, what it charg'd me with, was never done. That, sin prevented was, and many more By sending of the Scandal forth before The Crime was acted; So, into a Blessing A Curse was turn'd, which merits this confessing; And also, me obliges, all my dayes, On all occasions, to give GOD the praise; For, if, perhaps it had over-flowed then, The stream had never kept his bounds again. The scoffs and jeers, cast on me by the Rimes Of some reputed Poets in these times Have been my great advantage: for, th'esteem Which in my youthful dayes I had of them Had else perhaps, from my simplicity Drawn me, by their familiarity To those affected Vanities with which They have infected fools, and claw'd their itch. Were I but as ambitious of that name A POET, as they are, and think I am, It might a little vex me, when I hear How often, in their Pamphlets me they jear, Because, Truth seasonably I convey To such as need it, in a homely way, Best pleasing unto those who do not care To crack hard shells in which no kernels are; Or for strong Lines, in which is little found, Save an affected phrase, and empty sound. But, I do read them with a smiling pitty To finde them to be wicked, who are witty. At their Detractions, I do not repine; Their Poems I esteem as they do mine: Their Censures, I with sleighting overpass, Who, like words without sense, wit without grace; And, better am contented, without cause To hear their mis-reports, than their Applause. As also, that, they should by Pantaloons Admired be, and honour'd by Buffoons. Yea, as Job said, should they a Book compile Against me (as they may, and did erewhile) I would receive it, on my shoulders bear it, And as a Crown, upon my head would wear it. My fearlesness of SLANDERS doth not flow From Ignorance, which hinders me to know How, I am scandaliz'd: for it appears In Print, and I have heard it through both ears. I daily hear what ignominious lyes Detraction, to defame me doth devise. I know, whence they proceed; whereto they tend, In what likewise they possibly may end: And it would stagger and affright me too, Unless I knew the worst, all this could do For, they, who Idolize the Prelacy Impute to me no less than Blasphemy, And Sacriledge: And, I may well expect That, when their hopes have taken full effect, Though they with me at present, do but dandle, They then will curse me with Bell, Book and Candle. How ever, for their persons I will pray: For, malice hath not mov'd me to gain-say Their Prelacy; nor hope to get again What they usurp, and doth to me pertain: But, meerly conscientiousness of that Which in my place I vow'd to vindicate. Some, call me Traytor too; but well I wot, They do not so beleeve, or know me not. I never did betray my trust to any, Though I my self have been betray'd by many. With Traytors I have numbred beenf orone, And serv'd their ends, yet I my self was none: For, if like Absolom they did pretend To Sacrifice, and had another end, I went on in simplicity of heart, And did not from my Principles depart. If they intended, or committed Treason, I wronged not my Conscience, or my Reason By ought mis-done, except it were, perchance, Through over-sight, or else through Ignorance; For which, the Plagues now Epidemical, To me, as unto other men befall. I never was in any factious Plot, Nor likely seems it, by what I have got, That, with them in their Actings, I was one VVho, thriv'd by those designs they carried on; Though being subject to the present Law, I now do suffer, like Jack Fletchers Daw. But, howsoere, I seem to merit blame None, to the King, are truer than I am. Yet, if in Fame, we credit may repose, I am designed to be one of those, VVho shall not be vouchsaf'd that Common grace, VVhich at his Coronation granted was. GOD's will be done: Perhaps, the King well knows I need not, what on others he bestows; Or, to me, singly, will his favour show, That I his Magnanimity may know; And, that he will more gracious be to those VVho, him did not maliciously oppose, Than they, whom I did serve, were to their friends, Because they did not serve them, to their ends. But, if Report hath not divulg'd a Lye, VVhat, can I lose, or others get thereby? My whole estate, already is bereft, And, what will there be found, where's nothing left? My life, you'l say; Alas! that's little worth, It hath been wasting, ever since my birth; And (when it was at best) too poor a thing, To satisfie the Vengeance of a King. It will to most men seem ridiculous, To hear a Lion Rampant, kill'd a Mouse, Or, see an Eagle stoop down from on high, To trusse a Titmouse, or a Butterfly. The dread of such a loss will not come neer me, For, Age will shortly kill me, though he spare me; And, when there's no conveniency of living, Life, neither is worth asking or the giving. But GOD's intentions, and the hearts of Kings, Are such inscrutable and hidden things, That, none can search their bottomes; then much less Can they be fathom'd by maliciousness. Their wayes of working their own pleasures out, Are, many times, by wheeling round about, By cross and counter-actings, and by those Which seem'd their own Designments to oppose. The faithfull'st men, they do expose oft-times To hazzards; or with such as are for crimes Condemn'd, they number them; or, prove them by Desertions, dis-respects, and Poverty; And, frequently, do fit them for those places Wherein they best may serve them, by disgraces; But principally, at those times, wherein, Hypocrisie, becomes the Reigning-sin. More things I might insert, which have relations In this kinde, to my own prevarications, And, to th'Improvements, which have oft ensu'd By Scandals, which I then would have eschew'd. But, my Experiments will work on none, VVho cannot by their own, be wrought upon. Consider therefore all ye unto whom This Writing, by GOD's providence doth come, VVhat, in your selves and others, you have heeded, VVhich hath from Slanders, and from Praise proceeded; And, you shall finde more by the last undone Than by the former, at least, ten to one. According to our Proverb, the Bell clinketh Just so, as in his fancy, the fool thinketh And, they who flattring praises love to hear, Immediately, such to themselves appear, As represented by their Parasite, Though no more like than Black-swans are to white. Such Panegyricks I have sometime seen That, hard to be resolved, it had been, By him, whose judgement you therein should crave, Whether, the Panegyrist were more knave Than he was Fool, for whom, the same was made: But, of their equal Impudence I had No doubt at all, when wistly I had heeded What one gave, tother took, and what succeeded. For, I have oftentimes observ'd, thereby, Good Men deprav'd; Great Men, to Tyranny Incouraged; That, which is due to men By Natures Law, at first, they seize and then Those Attributes, at last, intrude upon That ought to be ascrib'd to GOD alone. Which evidences, that, Immodest Praise Is worse than Slander, and a ground-work layes, Whereon a superstructure may be built, To sink the Builders, down to shame and guilt. SLANDERS, and Persecutions of the Tongue A portion likewise is, which doth belong Unto the Saints; and sanctifi'd they are By him, with whom, an individual share Each must expect; we, do but only sup At brim, he drunk the bottome of the Cup: We altogether merited the blame, He underwent the sorrow and the shame. False witnesses against him were suborn'd; His Glory was to his dishonour turn'd; His nearest friends forsook him, and forswore him, His foes preferr'd a Murtherer before him; His Innocency not alone reproaching, But, likewise most injuriously incroaching Upon his righteous person, him pursu'd Till by a shameful death, he death subdu'd, And breaking from the grave, to Heav'n ascended, By Angels to Immortal Life attended; Where, now inthron'd, he Thrones prepared hath For all, who follow him in that rough path; And every slander, scorn, reproach and shame, He suffr'd here, adds glory to his Name. This is the way, and hath been ever since, Through which all men must pass, who go from hence To that Eternity, where shall be worn The Robes of honour, when the Rags of scorn Shall off be thrown. On him I fix mine eyes, And, that, will me enable to despise Terrestrial shame and honour: That, makes all My troubles, when at greatest, seem but small. That, makes me, whilst my Body is confin'd, Take pleasure, in the freedomes of the Minde; Not dreading present, or ensuing wrongs, Of wicked hands, or of malicious tongues. This Paradox, it helps me to maintain, That, where the Grace of GOD is not in vain, More profit, bitterest reproach affords, Than all the worlds Applauses, and fair words. Poverty is more profitable than Riches. Another Black-Guard hath beleagur'd me, That, seems to be the worst of all the three For, therewith, whosoever hath to do, Still is in danger of these other two, Imprisonment and Slander, who attend On Poverty unto her latter end. Yet, whatsoever in her self she seem, She merits not a total dis-esteem: For, 'tis an instrument of good and evil, Oft-times imploy'd against us by the Devil, And, oft by GOD himself, to such effects As may prevent the mischief he projects, By tempting to those manifold abuses Which Riches being mis-employ'd produces. There are two sorts of Poverty, that spring From diffring Roots; effects they likewise bring Both diffring and alike: for, providence Maugre all humane wit and diligence, Makes many poor, and all their industries Rendreth successeless by Contingencies, VVhich no man can fore-see, or wholly shun VVho shall be thereby outwardly undone. This Poverty, afflicts, at first, as much As any, but, disparages not such As bear it well; and though it grieveth many, (Except by their own fault) destroyes not any. The other sort, is sordid, vile, and base, Yet, draws her Pedigree, from such a Race, As doth in Country, City, and in Court, Still bear an extraordinary port: For, by the Fathers, or the Mothers side, It sprung from Prodigality or Pride, Or, from Improvidence or Idleness, And, is indeed, near kin to all Excess, Though her Alliance, these, now scorn and wave, Because, that she is ragged, and they brave. She, at this present time, both against me And others is employ'd: But, though she be Made use of by the world; yet, I well know The World it self abhors her as a foe, And, with a slavish dreadfulness doth fear her, On whatsoere occasion, shee comes near her. Yea, till this Bug-bear, was more known to mee, I, dreaded her almost as much as shee, And, did the best I could, to keep her from That nearness whereunto she now is come. For, he that would disgrace, and bring us to That State, which questionless might us undo, Let him but justly say that wee are poor, And, to destroy us, hee need say no more. VVhereas disgrac'd thereby we shall be much If, we continue to be very rich Of whatsoever crime or crimes, we stand Convicted by the known Laws, of this Land. For, VVealth cannot alone our Pardons buy And blot out every former Infamy; But, in a short time also, make us capable Of Trusts or places that be honourable; Yea, though they be those places which dispence To all the people, Law and Conscience; And marry Ladies (neither nor poor, nor painted) As if our bloods had with no crimes been tainted. But, to be poor, implieth every whit, As if we had nor honesty, nor wit, And, every thing, which since our lives begun, VVee honestly, nor prudently have done, Shall so traduced be as if that nought Had e're by us, been well done, spoke, or thought. There, where we have been kindly entertain'd, A civil usage, hardly shall be daign'd. There, where we have been honour'd in times past, Neighbours and Kinsmen will their doors make fast; Our old familiars will our persons shun, Like Rats, our Servants from the house will run, Which, then will be a place of desolation, And few thenceforth approach our habitation, But, Serjeants, Shreeves, or Bayliffs (beasts of prey) That little, which is left, to fetch away: And, when there doth remain nor sticks nor stones, Dead or alive, they'l take our Flesh and Bones. If all I should expresse, that might be said In this kind, you would think mee still afraid Of Poverty; and, that which I should speak, In some, perhaps, would such impressions make That, they with difficulty would beleeve What benefits I now thereby receive: Forbearing therefore, that which I might add I'le tell what profits may thereby be had; That, others (who can think I do not lye) May be no more afraid thereof than I: That, also, they who thereby grieved are, May in my Consolations have a share, To bear those burthens without discontent, Which are now on them, or seem imminent: For, little I will mention which was brought By reading, or by hearsay to my thought; But, that Philosophy, which Reason teaches, (Experience hath confirm'd, and GOD's Grace preaches) Unto my heart; that, it may sympathize With their hearts, who the same shall not despise: Which, though exprest in language rude and plain, Will, peradventure, to good use remain, When they, who of their Elegancies boast, Are, with their Kickshaws, in oblivion lost. When most are also, quite forgot, whom they Now dream, shall by their Poems, live for aye: And, when, that, which they despicable deem, VVith wise, and honest men, shall finde esteem. In my Restraint, I therefore, do not whine; At my Reproaches, I do not repine, Nor murmure at my losses; nor want sense Of what is in them, which may give offence. My seeming-friends, I must confess, are fewer, But, they whom now God gives mee are much truer; For, these that now I have, I finde more willing To give a pound, than those to pay a shilling. Yet, some of these are so poor, that, I'm fain Them, from their free Donations to restrain, Because, that of my Sufferings they are grown More sensible, than they are of their own. And this, an evidence of that doth give, VVhich pleaseth better than what I receive; Since it demonstrates, GOD, hath in this Nation A people, capable of his compassion. I am not ignorant how much disgrace Is thrown on Poverty, nor in what base Account they are, who, thereby are constrain'd Meerly, by Charity, to bee maintain'd: Yet nought ashamed am of that estate VVhich most so scorn, and so abominate. For, without loss of honour, men of merit, This Portion very many times inherit. Great Consuls, and renowned Generals (In such an exigent as oft befalls To very many thousands in this Nation) Have had relief without dis-reputation By Common Charity: and, Antient Story Hath kept memorials of it to their glory. But, I refer that which I might express (To take this Blur off) to another place. To have subsistance by meer Charity Is, to subsist by GOD, immediately, And, they are wicked, or, vain fools, at least, By whom those Exhibitions are disgrac't. For, very many of GOD's favourites Have been oft, thereby, from the worlds despights Preserv'd: yea, to the World, it would appear If shee would heed it, that, her Minions are Expos'd to such a Lot, and (without shame) Have been by Alms preserved as I am: And, not in those necessities alone, VVhich by mis-accidents are undergone, Are they reliev'd; but, very many be Thereby likewise upheld, in that degree, VVhich much is honour'd; yea, ev'n to Excesse, In outward splendor, and vain pompeousnesse. For, this way, not alone are Monks and Friers Maintained, with their Abbots and their Priors, But, even the great Prelates, all their lives, By Charities abused Donatives; And, yet as loftily advance their crest As if they had been Barons born, at least, Precedency usurping upon those, By whom, they from obscurity arose. By most men, Poverty is thought so base, That, they repute it for the great'st disgrace VVhich can betide them, by what way soever It comes; or howsoere they shall indeavour To keep it off; and think it not their least Dishonour, when enforced to subsist By Charity, although it shall be used VVith thankfulness, and in no wise abused. And, many seek to turn it to my shame That I now brought to this condition am. Yet, what's to mee befallen worse or more Than to good, wise, and great men heretofore? Renowned Princes in preceding ages, Have sought, and had Supplies and Patronages, From Forein Kings and States, in their distresses VVithout reprocah: yea, he that now possesses These three great Kingdomes was by indigence Constrained (not a very long time since) By Charity, to be both cloath'd and fed; To slake his hunger with a poor mans bread, And, to accept it, not alone from those Who were his friends, but also from his foes, (Whose gifts were baits, whose Table was a snare, And, of whom, if hee do not well beware, More mischief, and, dishonour will be done him Than by the Poverty then brought upon him.) Some other persons also, of great birth, From place to place have wandr'd through the earth Maintain'd by the Charity alone, Sometime by many, and sometimes by one; And other while, have seem'd so left by all, That they into great poverty did fall. Yet n'eretheless, whilst they have Preservation Retain still in the world some Reputation. They are meer fools, or worse, who do beleeve That, more disgrace, than these I can receive From such an In-come: for (by what I gather From thence) it is a real honour rather, That, GOD supplieth (as it were) from Heaven, When earthly wealth and honours are bereaven. When Israel had been Captiv'd sev'nty year, Hee made, even those, by whom inslav'd they were Them, from their tedious thraldome to redeem, VVhen there was none to help or pity them. It was their honour, that their preservation Should be vouchsafed, so to admiration, That Nations all, might in all times to come, By heeding it, consider well, from whom They must in such like cases aid expect; And, that, though by a long delay'd effect They seem forgot, and outward hopes quite past, There will bee a Deliverer at last, By whom, those wants for which they have been scorn'd Shall, to their honour, certainly be turn'd. What is it more to my Dis-reputation That GOD provideth for my preservation By Charity, than 'tis disgrace to those Who their Estates by Fire or Water lose And, thereupon the State vouchsafes a Breef, Whereby to ask, and to receive releef? Nay, what supply can be so honourable As that, which from hearts, by hands charitable Is raised and conferr'd, (unaskt, unsought) By them, of whom I never heard, or thought? This way (which without shame I do confess) GOD hath vouchsaf'd releef in my distress, To mee, as hee to men in like estate, Hath done in former times, and now of late. E're while at Piedmont in their persecutions Our Brethren hee reliev'd by contributions; And, should I think it my disgrace can be That, hee doth for my family and mee Provide, as for a Nation? I beleeve It blame deserv'd, if so I should conceive. Though I had ask'd; what without asking came, None could impute it justly to my blame All things consider'd: for, a Publick Score, Demonstrates, that this Nation owes mee more Than Food and Rayment; and that, in the fine My Want, will more be their disgrace than mine. My beggarly condition, is a Portion More noble, than Wealth gotten by Extortion, Bribes, projects, and those cheats whereby some bee Advanced to great wealth, and high degree, Thought honourable: yea Benevolences, And forced Loans, which otherwhile by Princes Exacted be, much more disgraceful are Than what my Benefactors do confer; For, at my need, it giveth mee releef, And, to the Givers, is no wrong or grief. I hear that is disgracefully objected VVhich by my Poverty is now effected: My house, they say, is desolate become, And, I confin'd am to a single room; My wife is of her Dowry quite despoil'd; I cannot give the portion of a childe To Son or Daughter, which a while ago I offred, and was able to bestow: And, that, where lately we had good respect Scoffs, flouts and jeers, are added to neglect; And, though these hardships possibly I may VVith patience bear, yet, certainly, say they, These his Relations cannot: yes, they can And have done, ever since the storm began: For, we fore-saw it, and we did prepare A stock of Patience, those events to bear. My Spouse is CHRIST's Spouse, by a Law Divine, More his, than she by Humane Law is mine. Our Children (though the world usurps a power O're them) are likewise, much more his than our; And, of her scorn, though she an Object makes them He neither helpless leaves them, or forsakes them. He made this Globe, with all that therein is; All things that are in Heav'n and Earth are his; VVe know it, and therefore do not despair That here on Earth; our loss hee will repair, Or, give us better Portions, where, they never Shall be impair'd, but injoy'd for ever. Yea, I am confident, that, if it may But add unto GOD's glory any way, Or, make for their Advancement in that path VVhich, to Eternity, a tendance hath, He'l either keep them Virgins to attend The LAMB, when he brings Babel to an end, Or, marry them ere long, without my cost, And, give them better Portions than they lost, Or, at the worst, they shall content be made VVith (be it more or less) what may be had. This, without wavering, beleeve I do, And, others will perhaps, beleeve it too, VVhen they consider Marriages in Heaven By GOD himself are made, and Portions given, In Love and Vertue, without prepossessing Of any other Medium, but his blessing. Wealth, in it self, is neither good nor bad, Nor Poverty, nor takes from, nor doth add To Happiness Essential, but, as they Are sanctifi'd, and as our games wee play: And, of the two, in that, least danger lies, VVhich we most seek to shun, and most despise. Wealth, makes men wasteful, dissolute and lazy, In manners rude, in Mind and Body crazy; Makes bold-men cowards, Free-men doth inslave; Many, to lose themselves, their wealth to save. It so befools them, that Asse-like, some bear Their golden-load, till, meat for worms they are, Enjoying no more profit by their Treasure, Save meerly, an imaginary pleasure VVhilst here they live; and, as if hope it gave It would be useful to them in the grave They hugg it, hoard it, and do lock it fast, (As long as living breath in them doth last) Not sensible of any detriment VVhich they do thereby cause, or might prevent. And, I beleeve, three Families, for one, That thereby thrive, by Riches are undone, Through those debauchments whereto they allure, Till, soul or bodies ruine, they procure. Contrariwise, despised Poverty, Incites to courage, and to industry, Breaks thraldoms Yoaks; cures often, those diseases VVhich Luxury ingenders, or increases; For, 'tis an Antidote against the Gout, And helps to purge all those ill humours out, That, send men to their graves, by an excess Either in gluttony, or drunkenness. Exorbitant desires it doth restrain, An empty belly makes a witful brain: A crosseless purse, to him small danger brings VVho bears it; for, before the Theef hee sings. And, when he dies, that which makes those men sad, VVho, whilst they liv'd, things in abundance had, Afflicts not him that's poor; for he's depriv'd Of nought, but what opprest him whilst he liv'd. A very poor man also, scapes their fates, VVho are belov'd, or hang'd for their Estates, And, some at this time, (I beleeve) will judge The last of these, to be a priviledge. Though many, not a little do rejoyce In that rude, loud, and everlasting noise VVhich, in most rich mens houses you shall hear, VVhere every Room is made a thorow-fare; Or, where, so many servants help to do Their works, as make one Bus'ness, more than two; VVhere, for each man who faithfully obeyes him, The Master feeds another, who betrayes him And, thrice as many, who, by night or day Do steal, perhaps, or spoil, or waste away More (oftentimes) than would the charges bear Of paying twice their wages, for that year: Though many like this; 'tis to me an ease That Poverty hath freed me quite from these. I, now, finde much more joy, than in much pelf, That, I have learned how to serve my self; To brush my Cloak, my garments to unloose, Put on and off, my stockings and my shooes, And, that, without my Servants, I can bee As well content, as they are without mee; I know both how to want, and to abound; And much more pleasure, I, in this have found, Than in choyce meats, that in a time of need, On bread alone, I savourly can feed, Or; on as scanty, and as homely fare (In my old age) as men that poorest are: Yet, be both more in health, and no lesse able, Than when GOD gave a fully furnish'd table, With meat so well cook't, that it did invite At every meal, a double-Appetite. And, I, whose worst apparel us'd to be As good as any mans of my degree, Can in those garments, without shame, appear Which, I, but lately was asham'd to wear; Unto which confidence, till want had brought mee, Philosophy, that lesson never taught mee. I, must likewise, ingenuously confess That, my distractions have been ten times less Since I had nothing left, than whil'st I had VVhat, in opinion, mee a rich man made: And, this is gain'd by losing what is gone, That, now, 'twixt having Wealth, and having none, I know the difference to be so small, That, upon neither of them, dote I shall: For, as much certainty, I do perceive In that uncertainty, at which I live As is in any temporal estate Of Goods or Lands (especially of late) Now, therefore, I desire not to be Rich, Or to be Poor, because (not knowing which Will best advantage mee) I to his pleasure Have left it, who, knows what Estate, and Measure Of Wealth and Poverty, best fit mee shall To do that, whereto hee vouchsafes a Call. I neither Wealth nor Poverty will chuse; Nor, which soere he gives will I refuse. But, most men would have somewhat of their As if supplies by Charity bestown, Would sooner fail them; yea, although their Father own, Well cloaths and feeds them, they desire much rather To finger their whole Portion, that they might Pursue their own desires, out of his sight. Some other, altogether do rely On their own prudence, and self-industry, And, of Contingencies, are so afraid That, thus within themselves their hearts have said; We possibly, into such wants may fall, And, so deserted likewise be of all By whom we have been harbour'd, cloath'd and fed, (Some of them being ruin'd, and some dead) That, unless wee can some Reserve provide, Whereby, what e're haps, wee may be supply'd, Wee may become exceeding miserable; Especially, if us to dis-enable, Old Age, Restraint, and Sickness should increase, And, to Necessities, add Helplessness. Should this befall (as possibly it may) Our Poverty would be too great, they'l say, VVith patience to be born: Alas! poor men, I'le grant all this may happen: but, what then? Did ever you yet know, or see, or hear, That Lands or goods freed any from this fear? If not, how can you hope to bring to pass That, which by no man, yet effected was? Have you not still a GOD? and, is not hee, A Refuge, though all other failing be? Your Trust was never plac'd on him alone, If him, you cannot trust, when all is gone. VVhile somewhat's left, whereby subsist we may, As David said, wee boast of him all day, But, bee assur'd, that e're from hence yee go, Hee'l make proof, whether it be thus or no. Him, and our own Cause, wee do much mistake, VVhen 'tis at best, the same at worst, wee make, And, so much on his Gifts our hearts are set, That, him, who did bestow them, we forget. To GOD, be therefore, praise, who, by this trial Gives mee both proof and means of Self-denial. I, am as worthless as the worst of you, I, nothing know by mine own merits due, But, that which now I suffer, and much worse, (The wages of an everlasting curse) My frailties are as great, my sins as many As yours; worse than my self I know not any, Though some so seem: and, yet, GOD's promises Make way through all these disadvantages, So well to know him, that I do beleeve My trust in him, hee never will deceive; And, that it would for my advantage be If all that may be fear'd, should fall on mee. VVere that condition (as it may bee) mine, I, then, should have no more cause to repine Than any other man, who to the doom Of Death submitteth, when his time is come: For, he who feels this day nor want nor sorrow, May be in worse estate than I to morrow. So long, as I, have any work to do, I shall have what is needfull thereunto. And when 'tis at an end, no matter whether The stroke of Death shall be received, either By Axe or Halter, (so I merit not, What is by Law the Malefactors Lot.) Or, starving, or, by one of those diseases Which, ordinarily, the body ceizes. For, that shame, which men fear, whilst they have breath By suffring, what they count a shameful death Is shar'd among mankind, and every one Bears part thereof with mee, when I am gone. And, whilst I live, what e're can suffred be, May fall as well to any, as to mee. Upon my death-bed, or, upon a Rack, When flesh and bones, and all my sinews crack, I may be therewithall, as blithe and frolick, As, when a burning Feaver, or, the Collick Age, or Consumptions, or the Pestilence Shall be the means to carry mee from hence. The pains of these, are oftentimes as strong, They do continue ev'ry whit, as long; And, at a Rich mans door, a Lazar dies Sometimes as easily, as he that lyes Upon a bed of Down, and who till death All necessaries in abundance hath. This, being well observ'd, it may appear That, we are fooled with false hope, or fear, When we shall dream to be secured more From all events, by being rich, than poor, Or, that, there any state on earth can be, VVhich may not have the same Catastrophe. VVhen GOD vouchsafes to make mens Poverties To glorifie him, he doth send supplies, Ev'n by unlikely means; and makes that nourish VVhereby, they, who are fed with dainties perish. Them, on whom Tyrants no compassion have, He, in the fiery furnaces can save; When they are cast into a Lions den, He maketh beasts more merciful than men. He, (when to manifest his Power Divine It pleaseth him) turns Water into Wine Which, at a poor mans wedding once was done More to his honour, than when Conduits run With Sack and Claret; which magnificence Adds honour to the marriage of a Prince. He, when men hungring after Righteousness Wait on him in a hungry Wilderness, Feeds thousands with a few loaves, and two fishes, As full, as if they had ten thousand dishes. The bottome of a Barrel, and a Cruse Shall Meal and Oyl sufficiently produce, To keep a family in time of Dearth, Until he sends a Plenty upon earth. He, when the Creditor, for payment asks (With rigor) doth fill many empty Casks, Out of one pot of Oyle, until there be A competence, to set the Debter free, And, for his livelihood, in time to come. Yea, by devourers, he doth nourish some: For, daily, that Elias might be fed The Ravens brought unto him flesh and bread. This hath been; and some things I can aver Of this kind, in mine own particular. Once, twice, nay, oftner I have been distrest As, I now am; and three times at the least, Have had repair vouchsafed mee by GOD, In such an extraordinary mode, That, many did admire, at my supply; As very well they might; for, so did I. And, when it seasonably may be shown, The manner of it will perhaps be known. At, this time, that, which many did suppose Would mee, ere now, have ruin'd; on my foes Hath cast a bridle, and will keep mee from What they intend, until my hour is come; And, peradventure, then, restrain them too, From acting all, that they intend to do. That, which both my Estate and Reputation Should have destroyed, is my preservation Another away; and an advantage brings, In better and more profitable things. For, Slanders, gain mee credit; that, doth glad mee Which was intended to deject and sad mee; That, which pursued, is, to make mee poor Makes my wants less, and my contentments more. And, as if GOD had purpos'd to bestow A sign upon mee, plainly to fore-show That, those Afflictions, and abhorred places, Which add to others, torments and disgraces, Should comfort mee, when common comforts fail, NEWGATE, suppos'd an ignomineous Jaile To mee, hath (as it were a Patroness) Contributed releef in my distress, Perhaps, from some of them, whose pressures were Either as great, or greater, than, mine are: Which (as I am obliged) to GOD's praise I do, and shall acknowledge all my daies To be an action, which doth signifie A greater Mercy, than that bare supply; For, it informs, and well assureth mee A Prison, shall no dammage bring to mee, And, that those places, which, make many poor, Will make mee richer than I was before. These things, I thus express, that others may Perswaded be, I do not write or say What I have read or heard, or whereof I Have no more in mee, save the Theory; And, knowing, this, which into words I spin Flows forth from what is really, within, And, by experience learn'd, it might effect That operation which I do expect. Most men, suppose them signs they are beloved Of GOD, and all their waies by him approved, (How negligent soe're of his commands) When outward things do prosper in their hands. They count them marks of his especial Grace If their Cows casts not Calf; if he doth bless Their Oxen; if their flocks of Sheep increase; If none doth in their persons them oppress; If their new-purchas'd Titles be made good; If, by their Trades and Rents, they to their Brood May leave great Portions; if, they may at Court Finde favour; and, if blessings of this sort Be multiply'd upon them, they suppose God is their Friend, and foe unto their foes. Indeed, these, blessings are; But signs to mee Of GOD's especial Grace, these, rather be; That, when of Land and Goods I am bereft, And, no external comfort seemeth left, I can depend on him, and be more glad, In his love, than in all that e're I had: That, I am freely justifi'd by him In that, for which the world doth mee condemn: That, I perceive, he deigneth mee releef, By that, which usually augmenteth grief; And, that, when most inrag'd oppressors are, Of their displeasure, I am least in fear: That, things which threaten troubles to prolong (Till they are helpless) make my faith more strong, My fear as little, whilst the Fight doth last, As at the Triumph, when all danger's past; And, that, their waies, who do most malice mee, Neither the waies of GOD, or good men be. These things, are of GOD's love a truer sign Than an increase of Corn, of Oyl and Wine, And, I do smile to think, how like poor slaves They will e're long, sneak down into their graves, Who, make false boast of GOD, when they with shame Shall know, that, by their spight I better'd am. And, when my Country hears the next Age tell How, mee they us'd, who alwaies lov'd it well; What, better men have suffer'd; what, in vain Was said; what done, undone, and done again; How, Truth's bely'd; how Lies upheld for Truth; How much the heart dissented from the mouth; Their Deeds from what they seem to think and say; And, how, at fast and loose, we now do play; It will be thought, perhaps, this Generation Had lost Faith, Reason, Justice, and Compassion, And, they, who shall by strict examination, Search out the cause of this prevarication Will finde an hypocritical Devotion Sprung from the love of Riches and Promotion, (Dis-robing Piety of her plain Dresse, To be dis-figur'd with that pompousness Which is affected by the Man of Sin) Of all that is amiss, chief cause hath been. I must not scribble all that might be pend Upon this Subject, lest I more offend Than profit, or, lest, for want of speed, Be hindred, in my purpose to proceed. But, one more Argument, I'le therefore add Whereby, it out of question may be made, That, to be very Rich, indangers more A real Happiness, than to be poor; And, prov'd it shall be by a Demonstration, That, will admit no future confutation. Because, it shews that Wealth hath not alone More hurt to many single persons done Than Poverty, but, also to the Race Of all mankind; and unto GOD's Free-Grace Injurious been; dishonour brought to CHRIST, And, set up his opposers Interest. Observe, it, for, I, nothing will alledge But, that, whereof, the meanest wit may judge. I need not tell you, wee more easily May drive a Camel through a needles eye, Or, thread it with a Cable, than, to heaven Rich men ascend, or thither may be driven. For, most have heard, he spake to that effect Whose judgement none have reason to suspect; Yet, I will shew to you what way he went, And how, by his example to prevent That difficulty; For, he did not say, One thing to us, and walk another way As many do, and did, who would be thought To follow him, and teach us what he taught. In plain expression I will let you see Who, those Impostors and Apostates be Who speak sometimes his words, and do profess His Truth, yet are in practice nothing less. CHRIST, knowing well, that, Avarice, Ambition, Wealth and Preferments ripen to perdition, And, that, they so insensibly deprave The best and wisest men, if way they give To their Allurements; that, although he were The Son of GOD, and needed not to fear The frailties of his flesh, he, to the Law Conformed, and preserved it in awe By true obedience; mortifi'd that nature Which he assumed from the Humane-creature, Both by an unconstrain'd Humility, And, by a voluntary Poverty: And, did for our example, and our sake Forbear, of things indifferent to partake, Lest, we, who know not how aright to use Our Liberty, things lawful might abuse By taking that for food, which was provided For Physick rather, when a Cure we needed. When, first, from Heav'n he came (though Lord of all In Heav'n and Earth he was) within a stall He took up his first Lodging; passed on Throughout his Childe-hood, as he had begun; And, to the world, no better did appear Than Son to Joseph, a poor Carpenter. When to mans age he came (for ought we know) He liv'd by labour, as such poor men do. And, when he did begin to manifest Himself to be the Saviour JESUS CHRIST, His Royalty was furnish'd out no more With Earthly Riches, than it was before; He had nor Lands, nor Goods, to finde him bread, Nor any House, wherein to rest his head. He had, for what was needful, no supplies But, pious men and womens Charities. Poor despicable Fisher-men (or such) And, those, who neither Noble were, nor Rich He chose for his Disciples; and when these He sent abroad on his Ambassages, They were forbidden either to take care Wherewith they might be fed, or what to wear, Or, mony to provide for their expence, But, leave those things unto GOD's providence. To them his Gospel-principles he gave, And, taught them how themselves they should behave In their Discipleship, both where neglect They found, and also where they had respect. He them injoyned, to be meek and humble, And, as the likeli'st block to make them stumble Warn'd, to Precedency, not to aspire, Or any Lordly Attributes desire: For, his Disciples in their low'st condition Began to be infected with Ambition. The Sons of Zebede, when they were poor, Were tainted therewithall; And, how much more It doth deprave men when they wealthy grow CHRIST did fore-see, and we have liv'd to know By that, wherein the Prelacy hath varied From his Example; and, by him who carried The Bag in his time, we have learned too, What Avarice may make a Bishop do. Moreover, when by publick Acclamation CHRIST had a visible inauguration Into that Kingdome, whereto he was born, No rich or Royal Robes by him were worn; Nor sought he to be honour'd with such things As are affected by terrestrial Kings, But, meekly, through Jerusalem did pass Not on a barbed Steed, but, on an Asse, (Which none had backt before) &amp; which nor Pad, Nor saddle, trappings, or a foot-cloth had, Save what the people on his back had thrown, And, to that purpose taken from their own. When he was crown'd, no golden Crown he wore Lin'd with soft Fur, but, one much worse than poor: A Wreath of Thorns, he wore upon his head; He, had no better Scepter than a Reed; A Purple Robe, was cast on him in scorn, To be at that sad Coronation worn. For him, there was prepar'd no other Throne, Except a Cross, to be advanc'd upon. Nor Fun'ral Rites, nor Monument, nor Grave, Had he when dead, but, what some lent or gave. Thus, poorly was his Kingdome here begun; Thus, his Affairs of State were carried on. So long, as he a life on earth retaind, Like no terrestriall Monarch, here he reign'd; But, glorifi'd his Kingdom in this mode: And, when that he ascended up to GOD, Hee, by his Holy Spirit, so did minde, (And so inspire those whom he left behinde) To propagate the same, that they pursu'd The Discipline and Paterne, which he shew'd. From SATANS Kingdoms, to distinguish it He added whatsoever did befit A Righteous Government, in every thing Which might advance the Throne of such a King, Without those Baubles which do more oppress Their Subjects, than promote the Common Peace. To this end, and preserve with purity The Church and Saints in their integrity, They left behinde them precepts, counsels, cautions, And, many (not ambiguous) declarations, Both to inform us of the mind of CHRIST, And, of the wiles of that great Antichrist Which was to come, and should foundations lay To set a Kingdome up, another way; That, might (if possible) be thought to be CHRIST's Kingdome, as now thousands live to see The world reputes what they erected have, And, with her Ornaments, made rich and brave. Moreover, that CHRIST's Vineyard and Cornfield, Might fruits both nourishing and pleasant yeeld, No needful diligence, at first was wanting, In digging, dressing, sowing, or in planting; Or, so to beautifie it, that none might Despise it, or not therein take delight. And, that, none should by Pride, or Avarice Intrude upon their Brethrens Legacies, They, truly, his Last Tstament recorded; The same into a Gospel-Law they worded, Which hath sufficiency, without additions By humane policies, or new Traditions, To constitute his Kingdome, and prevent Prevarications, by mis-government. To bar out Innovations, they by Deed Confirmed, what they had in words decreed. From no true principles of Faith they swerved, Devotions reverence they well preserved, Without new-fangles, and those trincketings, Which Superstition to adorn it brings. The Sacrament (by which the death of Christ Should be remembred) they made not the Test Of things, no way relating to that end, For which, that Mystery he did intend, Or, rendring, what should be by his intention, The Band of Love, a means to breed dissention: Nor was the Bread, or Wine, then Idoliz'd; But, that Love-feast, was duly solemniz'd, In decency, without vain pomp of State; Altars, Court-cubbord like, beset with Plate; Waxe-lights at noon, in Silver-Candlesticks, Or, any other of those needless tricks, Which were first introduced, in those daies When Wooden-Priests, got silver Chalices, They us'd no superstitious Adorations, Cringings, ridiculous gesticulations, Or mimick Actions: nor these, or those, postures Of Body; neither places, times, or vestures, Were so essential made, or necessary To holy Duties, that, none ought to vary From those Formalities: nor, painted walls, Nor Pictures had they, Surplices, nor Palls, Chimers, hoods, Rochets, nor rich Copes, nor Tippets, Nor was their Service cut out into sippets, For, such toyes (then unknown) did not begin Till Antichrist arose and brought them in; And, till with Wealth and Dignities inricht The Presbyters, and Bishops were bewitcht. To have prevented this (as I have said) A good Foundation CHRIST himself had laid, And, at the first, that Structure was begun, Which, he intended should be built thereon. Such as were then, by sacred Ordination, Call'd Bishops, watchful were, and took occasion From ev'ry slip, to travel, preach, and write, That, errours and mis-deeds prevent they might. As soon as Demas and Diotrephes, With such like, were observed in their daies To innovate, and labour to begin That Prelacy which, afterward crept in, They so oppos'd it, that, till from his chain, The Devil (then confin'd) was loos'd again, None could set up what a faction begun, Though many were then working thereupon; For, CHRIST's Apostles, and their true successors (In spight of Innovators, of Oppressors And Hereticks) by that simplicity Of Truth, which was profest in Poverty, Did so distinguish it, from what by those Advanc'd would be, when Antichrist arose, That, they inviolate maintaind thereby Her honour, and her native purity, Without that carnal Pomp, and costly Pride With w??, the STRUMPET, now seems glorifi'd. And wherewith, shee hath half the word inchanted, Since Heathenish Deities, were first supplanted. That Miracle, was wrought by GOD, through them Whose Poverty the world did then contemn: Ev'n when their Worshippers were in full power, And, when inrag'd at height, sought to devour Their scorn'd Opposers, they withall that odds Were not then able to support their Gods. But, when the Saints were as distrest and poor, As they, who seek their bread from door to door, When, they broke through a tenfold persecution, To put their Masters will in execution; When in despised habits through each Nation They preach'd the blessed means of our salvation; Were counted Fools, and as much dis-esteem'd As any, who are now Phanaticks deem'd; When, they had neither Academick Halls, Schools, Colledges, or sumptuous Cathedrals, Nor Universities, nor Deans, nor Doctors, Prebends, Archdeacons, Chancellours or Proctors, Nor Rents, nor Tythes, nor Pensions, nor Oblations, Excepting onely good mens free-donations; When they, nor Bishops had, nor Presbyters, Save, such as holy Scripture characters, (Who claimed no Precedence, or Submission, From those, authoriz'd by the same Commission; When, they were meek and lowly, in their places, Poor in their Temporalties, and rich in Graces; When, they (as necessary to salvation) On no man, did impose an Observation Of daies, times, forms, or Ceremonious Rite, But, as to edifying, tend it might; And, left them to be practis'd, or omitted, As, either they might, or might not be fitted To holy Duties, without just offences, To other mens, or their own consciences: (In which case, none that hath Sobriety, Will bar another of his Liberty.) When Pastors medled not at all, or little, With Soveraigns, whether they themselves, or Title Were good or bad; excepting in those cases Which did concern the duties of their places; But, in the fear of GOD, obedient were To that Power, which did visibly appear Impowered to protect them (whilst it stood With that obedience, which they owe to GOD; And, did by suffring, render satisfaction, For what they dared not perform in action.) When, Emperours nor Kings did them esteem, Nor flatter'd were, or fawn'd upon, by them; Ev'n then by these, mens Doctrines and Examples, Were all the Gentiles great and glorious Temples Throughout the world destroy'd: their Superstitions (From which New Rome retrived her Traditions) Were then by those expell'd: Their Oracles, Then silenc'd were; Their jugling Miracles Were prov'd Impostures: Then, the Sophistries Of those whom former ages thought most wise, Were found but fallacies; their wisdome folly; Unsound their Manners, their beleef unholy; Their books of Curious Arts, whereby great fame They had acquir'd, were cast into the flame; And, then, their Flamins, and Archflamins too, (Who domineered as the Prelates do) Were (as these, in the time appointed shall) Brought to those dooms, which on Impostors fall. The Worship also, wherewithall the Jews, The worlds credulity sought to abuse, As well as her Philosophy, was foil'd At their own weapons; of that glory spoil'd Whereof they boasted; and all this was done, Without the Outward Pomp, now doted on. And, if the Prelates, can with all the glory, Which they have gotten by things Transitory, And, by the help of all the Kings on earth, To such another Miracle give birth, Ile think, that they as great Impostors are, As Jannes, and as Jambres long since, were; Yet, still beleeve, that, maugre all their power, The Rods of these, will their charm'd Rods devour. That, which the Prelates take to be a sign Of Sanctity, the most becoming shrine Of sacred Piety, and true Devotion, I mean, that Pomp, whereby (for self promotion) They seek to trim and paint it, forth hath brought (Compar'd to this) not any thing worth ought But meer contempt: for, by the zeal of those, Who, made such poor, and despicable shows, More honour to the Church of Christ is done, Than all their wealth and honours, have thereon Conferr'd, in more than fifteen hundred years, By all their great and potent Favourers. They, whom the Churches Poverty brought forth, Though poor externally, had inward worth; Good life was practis'd, sacred Truth profest Religion, with sincerity imbrac't, In her poor Dress, by many an humble Saint, Without the fucus of a Whorish paint; And, till men leaving their plain sober way, Sought by external wealth, to make her gay, The Church, in Piety, did still increase Though outward persecutions did not cease. But, what hath followed since her Poverties, Are chang'd for temporal wealth and dignities? Since Princely Prelates sought for carnal things, Had learn'd to flatter Emperours and Kings, And, cheat them with a seeming Loyalty, Made credible by fained Piety? Since they, an Ambodexters part could play, Had got two Masters, and a double pay, Topt wreathes Imperial with a Triple crown, Made Rebels Martyrs, trod Allegiance down And, had on so much wealth and honour ceas'd, That they could turn the scale w?? way they pleas'd, What, hath e're since that time, proceeded thence But, products of Destructive consequence? And those Confusions, for which (withont shame) Some, to the Saints of GOD, impute the blame, As heretofore, the Heathen Tyrants did To them, whose blood they innocently shed? And, though that in their publick declamations, (As also, in their private exultations) The Prelates, to a joy transported seem, Like (as they say themselves) men in a dream, To see that Wealth, and Pomp restor'd again, Whereof, small hope they did erewhile retain; Though, of a golden Hierarchie dreaming, They (still the Poverty of CHRIST blaspheming) Do think, the Angels are as glad as they Of that, wherein they triumph at this day; And, say (which I conceive to be a lye) That, they, could well content have been to dye, The next day after they restor'd had been To that condition, which they now are in; Yet, I beleeve, it will not, in the cloze, Make them so happy, as they now suppose; Or, give much cause unto this Generation, To be well pleased in their restauration. For, to these Nations, or unto our King, What, can I think, these golden Calves will bring Save, at the last, what followed upon that, Which Jeroboams policy of State Produc'd in Isr'el, when he (as it were In spight of GOD) set golden Calves up there? And, his Successors walkt on in that way, VVhat er'e those Prophets, from thenceforth, could say VVhom GOD, in Justice, or in Mercy, sent Their threatned desolation to prevent? VVhat, is more likely, if th'abominations Of, almost ev'ry Good-man, in these Nations Shall be indulg'd? (and, though it ever since It first begun, produc'd nought but offence?) For, Observation daily finds it plain, That, fear of losses, or the hope of gain, Or, of Promotion, will root out apace The feeds and plants, of Piety and Grace. And, since, already, it so multiplies Apostates, and augments Hypocrisies, What can be thought, but, that, those daies, we see Wherein, th'Elect shall hardly saved be, Unless GOD shorten them? for, whatsoere Men say, or do, they fall into a snare; And, those Deceivers, whereof last I spoke, To blinde mens eyes, have raised such a smoak, That, few, know which way safely turn they may; Or, what to think, beleeve, hope, do, or say. Such Histories, as are approv'd by those, Who never did the Prelacy oppose, Affirm, that when the Churches Augmentation Of wealth and honour, by the free donation Of Constantine, was first on them conferr'd, A voice, was in the Air distinctly heard, Which did these words, articulately say, Into the Church is poison pour'd this day: And, thereupon, that, quickly did ensue, Which, manifests the Saying to he true: For, they, who read Historical Relations, Of what hath been in former Generations, (As also, in their times) discreetly heeding What, their Experience addeth to their reading, Will finde, that, here, and, almost ev'ry where, The Prelates cause of many mischieves were. Yea, that the greatest troubles on the earth, Sprung indirectly, or directly, forth From their Ambition, Avarice and Pride, When Gold and Silver they had multipli'd. How many troubles, have been here of late Occasion'd by what they did innovate? How many thousand Families undone In these three Kingdomes are, since they begun, Those Whimzies, which the prime occasion were Of all the Civil Wars and discords here? And, what more will ensue, GOD only knows, For, wee, already see ill boding shows. Their Avarice, and matchless greediness, Of hoarding Treasure up, to an excess At such a time as this, wherein the State Is straitned; (and when much it doth abate That, Trading, whereby, our necessities Publick, and Private, should have their supplies) Produceth ill effects; and how by these Both in their Civil Peace, and Consciences, Men may disturbed be, there's cause of fear, By what in their deportments doth appear. And, I observ'd this (which Ile now record) That, when they first begun to be restor'd, With them, return'd (God grant there come no worse) May-poles, Maid-marian, &amp; the hobby-horse, Beside, some other heathenish Prophanations, Maugre the Kings late pious Proclamations. It would fill many volumes to collect What Prelacy did heretofore effect; How troublesome in other Common-weals, And Kingdomes, it hath to GOD's Israels, And, other people been: how oft have they Endeavoured their Soveraigns to betray, Unto the See of Rome? how oft, to bring The People into bondage to their King, That, when their purpose they had wrought on him Both King and people, might be slaves to them? How insolent and impudent a power, Was then usurped when an Emperour Did hold the Stirrup? when an English king They to so great a slavery did bring, (And foolery to boot) as to decline His Royal Person, at Tom Beckets shrine? Do pennance there, and be so much befoold, That, school-boy-like, he was with Rods there school'd, By Canterbury Monks? when, he, that trod Upon his Leige Lords neck (blaspheming GOD) That piece of scripture, to himself applide Which could in none, but CHRIST, be verifide? Intolerable was his arrogance, But, such are oft effects of their advance; And, thus, have Kings and Emperors been rewarded, Who, their lean Gammons, had with fat inlarded. These, are the blessed and the holy fruits, Of their great wealth, and Lordly Attributes; Yet, these are not the worst; for Kings and Princes, Were not alone by Prelates insolencies, Abus'd like other men, in what relates Unto their lives, their honours and estates; But, GOD, is also, thrust out of his Throne: Ev'n his Peculiars are usurp'd upon; And, such Intrusions are now made, by these Upon mens Faiths, and on their Consciences, That, they make many Proslites for the Devil, Expose them to an everlasting evil, And, causes are of mischiefs and offence, VVhich all the world can never recompence: For, Bonds they lay, where GOD doth none impose; Unbinde, from what he never will unlose; And, whatsoere he speaks, his words, by these, Are made to mean, what ever they shall please. But, let the Saints in patience persevere; For, though these arrogantly domineer, And in their hopes grow every day more strong, Their time of standing, will not now be long: The Kings, who with the Cup of Fornications Have been made Drunk, for many Generations, Will at the last grow sober, or else mad, To see what power on them, these Juglers had, And, help to bring that fatal Judgement on, Which must reward them for what they have done. Great Babylon it self, will shortly fall, And, they shall have their Portion therewithall. To do us harm, they had not been so able, If in those Principles, men had been stable Which constitute CHRIST's Church; nor to assist As they have done, the Throne of Antichrist. Had these been still content to seek no more (As Bishops were in ages heretofore) Than might supply things needful in their place, For Nature to promote the works of Grace, (Nor stretched their Precedency ought further, Than did conduce to Decency, and Order) It had not such ill consequents produc'd: And, could they but, yet, timely be reduc'd, To that Bound; Discords, would ere long be ended, And, much, that is amiss would be amended. (GOD Bless the King, and open so his eyes, That, he may see in what his safetie lies; And prosper mee, as I desire hee may Walke and continue, in that blessed way, Which truly to his glory doth redound; Whom he so kind, and merciful hath found. My prayers are, that GOD would make him strong Against the Charms of every glosing Tongue; In Grace and Vertues, daily so improve him, That, GOD and Men, for ever more may love him; And, that, I may finde favour in his sight, According as I am in heart, upright: For, whatsoever, hee shall bee to mee; To him, I'm true, and so will ever be. GOD, pardon all that I have done amiss, And, so, I finish this Parenthesis.) Here, I have shown you, by plain demonstration, Which (as I said) admits no confutation, That, Poverty (though much despis'd) is better Than Riches; and, that, I thereto am debter Much more, for what concerns my happiness, Than, by what can be got by an excess In Wealth and Honour: And, what's here rehearst, Will bee approv'd, when Synods have reverst Their Votes; and be by Wisest men upheld VVhen Acts of Parliament shall be repeal'd, That, were confirm'd, by Commons, Lords &amp; King, VVhen, GOD, shall to effect, his purpose bring, And, those men to their wits, who, little heeded, VVhat, would ensue that, wherein they proceeded. Now I have done. If this you can beleeve, And, GOD, his blessing thereunto shall give, I have what, I desired for my paine; And, what's here writ, shall not be writ in vain: for, all that's in my words, is in my heart, In every circumstance, and every part. Perhaps, this despicable Barly-cake, May tumble, till a fatal breach it make Into the Tents of Midian: but, thereon VVhat ere else follows, let GOD's will be done. Though no man living, should the same regard, A good work, to it self gives full reward; And, there is nothing, that can make it less, Than what it is, or, bar it from increase: For, though such Accidents, may oft befall, As, that, it will not so appear to all, Nor Poverty, Imprisonment, Disgrace, Life, death, good, bad condition, time nor place, Praises, Privations, nor ought that hath name, Makes real Vertue, not to be the same. Glory be to GOD. A Word on the behalf of Mr. Zachary Crofton Prisoner in the Tower. Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye the same unto them; for this is the Law and the Prophets, Matth. 7. 12. Since all men erre, and one way, or another, Occasion what mis-happens to each other, I cannot but be sensible of that, Which may bee mine, and ev'ry mans estate. CROFTON's a Prisoner, and, some say, must dye; Yet, I, from none, can learn the reason why. If his declaring for the COVENANT, Be all his Crime, a reason I shall want, To satisfie mee, by what Law wee shall Conclude that his Offence is Capital; Or, how, that can imputed be for sin, Which, by no Law, hath yet forbidden been. GOD, bless the King and State; and so mens reason Preserve, that, we may once know Truth from Treason, Lest we at last be brought into a snare, And, be uncertain, when we Traitors are: For, though it safely might bee justifi'd That, rather than GOD, Men should be obey'd; Such, may not be their own Friends, who condemn That man, who pleaded both for GOD, and them, And, to the hazzard of his life persists, In vindicating their Joynt-Interests, To no mans disadvantage, except those, Who, are to GOD and Men, apparent foes. Mee thinks, it is great pity, that, a man Who, to GOD, King and Church, both may, and can Be serviceable; and, who doth profess His Judgement, in meer conscientiousness Without design'd contempt, unto the State, Or, purposing a mutinous debate, And, never gave just cause to be suspected, He was to either of them disaffected, (But, unto both of them, good service did, When they of Faithful Servants had most need; And, hath but done his duty, to oppose Those Harpies, which to all Good men are foes) Should by mistake, or, by mis-information, As one, who had deserved no compassion, A Sufferer with Malefactors be Because, hee sees not, what he cannot see; Or, else, because he cannot credit give To what, he findes no reason to beleeve; For, who will care for life, where Prelacy Attains to such a height of Tyranny, That, it inslaves both Soul and Body too? And, where, of what we should beleeve and do, No certainty, can by their LIGHT be known, Nor leave obtain'd, to make use of our own, Though voluntarily the King ingag'd To let the Conscience be so priviledg'd; And, Mercy, in some other things, did show Whereof, the Prelacy will not allow. Whether the COVENANT, by right, or wrong, Were made, or burnt, it doth not now belong To private men to question: For, when dooms Are past in Parliament, the Case then comes Before GOD's Judgement-Seat; and, woe to them, Who, that, which hee approves of, shall condemn. Till, therefore, he, thence answers their appeal Wise men, their private thinkings will conceal, And, him implore, to whom referr'd it is, To right what's wrong, and pardon what's amiss. What, Fame reports by Crofton to be done I, singly and sincerely musing on, Do finde, by that; whereof inform'd I am, That, hee more merited reward than blame, Unless, that, wherein other men have err'd (Without his fault) may be to him transferr'd. The Covenant hee took, but did not make it; Nor forced any one to take, or break it; But, in his place alone, the same maintain'd (To his own hazzard) as it appertain'd Unto the honour, peace, and preservation Both of the Royal persons, and the Nation, As he thought it oblig'd; and as it stood In force, relating to the Will of GOD And, no jot further; unless, wee suppose Hee err'd, in pressing it, to bar out those Who, have been, still are, and will be agen, Foes unto GOD, to Kings, and Common men, As soon as they themselves enabled finde, To do the work, for which they were design'd. For, that, which CROFTON most insisted on, (As purpos'd by the Covenant to be done) Is an exploding of the Hierarchy Brought in, by Antichristian-Prelacy, (To whose support, his Oath cannot extend Who, CHRIST's Faith, is obliged to defend.) And, if that, be a fault, GOD, mee forgive, For, therein, I resolve, to dye, and live. The stress of his Case, as appears to mee, Lies there; if, hee of ought else guilty bee, I, leave him to excuse himself; for, never Saw I his face, nor shall perhaps for ever. But, hee's in durance, and I fain would do As, in his Case, I would bee done unto; And, peradventure, it will needful bee That, fome, ere long, should do as much for mee. There are, besides those actings, which do fall Within the duties of our Common-call, Some, having so peculiar Relation, To GOD's Designments in our Generation, That, they not onely do the force abate Of what is call'd, The Reason of the State, But, of those Precepts also, at sometimes, Whose violations are most hainous Crimes, In any other case; as may appear, By many proofs, which I will now forbear. GOD, doth a Generation-work design; For, ev'ry man: These, are a part of mine, And, I had rather dye ten deaths for one Than take ten lives, to let it bee undone. Till that is done, mee, Lord vouchsafe to keep; And, David-like, then, let mee fall asleep. Act. 13. 36. A Proclamation In the Name of the King of Kings, To all the Inhabitants of the Isles of Great Brittain: And especially, to those who have Hypocritically pretended to Justice, Mercy, Honesty and Religion; (as also to them who have lived in open Prophaness and Impiety) summoning them to Repentance, by denouncing GOD's Judgements, and declaring his Mercy, offered in the Everlasting Gospel.

As David said, The wrongs of open foes I could have born, but near my heart it goes, When I am grosly injured by them, Who did my loving Friends and Brethren seem, And cannot chuse (although I do sustain Ev'n that with patience) but thereof complain, In hope, it may occasion give to some Who fail'd in that kind, henceforth to become So sensible of what was heretofore Mis-done, that they will so offend no more: For, unto them, this is the worst design Which I intend by this Complaint of mine. Two sorts of men there are, with both of which I've had to do; and (though not very much) More than enough it seems. One sort of these, Those Persons are, by whose maliciousness, Most, who are conscientious men reputed, Are for that cause traduc'd and persecuted; And (when they thereunto shall be inclin'd) A staff to beat a dog, who may not find? 'Tis care to scape the venom of their tongue, So impudent they are in doing wrong, And brutish in their Censures: yet but few, Except some like themselves, believe that true Which they report; and they themselves do know, That they asperse me with what is not so. Of such men therefore, here complain I not; Because, by these, I have not often got A disadvantage, which would equal'd be With what might happen by their praising me. The poysnings of the other, more infect, Because, receiv'd they are without suspect, And, vented with a counterfeited shew Of better ends than those which they pursue. Some of these being partners with those sinners, Who were of our late Troubles first beginners, Did, with a mask of Piety and Zeal To GOD, the King, and to the Commonweal, Drive on their own designs; And (having made Of seeming Godliness, a gainful Trade) Their opportunities now being gone, Of preying upon those they prey'd upon, Would make a prey of them, whom they pretended In times preceding, much to have befriended. So feeds the Pickrel, when he cannot find A Roach or Dace, on fish of his own kind. And, some of these, because I will not be Inslav'd to that, from which I should be free, Have (thereto mov'd by Avarice and Pride) Without just cause, me lately vilifi'd To some of my best Friends; ev'n unto them Whose Charity supports me at this time: And, should it be believed, might much more Undo me, than all they who heretofore Have been my open Foes. Moreover, some, That I might wholly succourless become, Are pleas'd to say, I am not so bereft Of my Estate, but that enough is left For my support. Wherein, if they speak right, They render me so gross an Hypocrite, That I deserve no Friend; And if I am By them beli'd, then much are they to blame, VVho have, as far as in them lies, to starving Exposed me and mine, without deserving. But, this I fear not: for, if that supply Shall fail, which I have had by Charity, He, who by other hands, hath Mercy shown, VVill from henceforth relieve me by his own: And, these are thus confuted, without feigning, If they know ought of mine, that's yet remaining VVithin my power; Or, but so much as may (If ever it be mine) my Debts repay, Save what's yet wholly lost, I give it all To him, who thereof make discov'ry shall; And hereby, both confirm this Gift for ever; And urge him that Discov'ry to endeavour VVho raised that Report; so he thereby Shall have some profit, if it be no lye. I do perceive, to have me quite destroy'd The Devil many Agents hath imploy'd In sev'ral modes; which that prevent I may, Nought more or better have I now to say, Or do, which will avail me, but to fly To my Protector, to your Charity VVho know me, and unto that Evidence VVhich I have given of my Innocence To you who know me not; in hope you'l do As in like case you would be done unto: And that when their malevolence hath wrought Till it shall purge its own corruption out, It will abate, and some effects produce, VVhich both to them and me may be of use. If me you judge, as you would judged be, No more needs to be said thereof by me; Especially to him who truly knows, VVho giveth deeper wounds, than open foes. This Case of mine concerneth now and then, Not me alone, but other honest men. Such like false brethren, in all Ages were Among the Saints, and such-like still there are. Therefore these Lines at this time were bestown, As justly for their sakes, as for mine own, Since, of what here I for my self do plead, Some other, thus abus'd, may stand in need. II. A causual Meditation on Faith, Hope, Fear and Love. To keep me watchful, whilst my Foes My person here shall fast inclose, By Meditations I assay To keep the dread of them away; And whilst my Contemplation flew At various Objects, in her view, (Among such Musings as were brought Into my mind) this came to thought. Faith, Hope, and Fear, and Love are that, VVhich renders ev'ry mans Estate To be exceeding good or bad, Extreamly pleasureful or sad, According as that Object proves, VVhich he believes, fears, hopes, or loves. Make GOD the bottom and the top Of thy Fear, Love, Belief and Hope, And thou art then safe, whatsoere Thou dost believe, hope, love, or fear: But, if the World their Object be, Or, any other thing but He, Thou art destroy'd: For, by these four, Misplac'd, thou givest them a pow'r To ruine thee, who else had none VVhereby a mischief might be done. If on the World thy hopes depend, Despair will be their latter end; VVhen her fair-speakings are believ'd, Thou wilt be certainly deceiv'd; If her thou love, she will for that Requite thee with despiteful hate; And, if thou fear her, she'l endeavour To make thee slave to fears for ever. This by experience I found true, And thereof thus forewarn I you. Affect no Pleasure; for 'tis vain, And terminates at last in pain. Fear not, when thou shalt be opprest In doing well; for, such are blest. Trust not in Wealth; for, it hath wings, And flies away like other things: Nor Honour; for, it often spends Its stock, and in dishonour ends. Rely not upon Prodigies; For, they are partly Truths and Lyes; And, Signs and Wonders can afford No such assurance as GOD's Word. Place not your trust in Kings; for, when They speak like Gods, they act like men. No, nor your best Works trust you in, For all mans Righteousness is sin. Your Faith, Fear, Hope, and Love on none Ground therefore, but on GOD alone; And, when thus, you have learn'd to do, Perswade all other men thereto; Not terminating Meditations, In meer unactive speculations; For, they but like those flashes are, VVhich we mis-call a shooting-Star. Here, whilst my Flesh is in restraint, Lest else my Soul grow dull and faint, Her, with such thoughts I entertain, And find them not to be in vain; Though more I needed, I confess, These Musings, when I suffered less. I might be safely rich agen, Could I be still imployed then As I am now. But, who is able, To thread a Needle with a Cable? They, who in Winter keep at home, In Summer-time abroad will come; And, though a Prison seems a curse, Our Liberty oft makes us worse. We pray, when Winds and Seas do roar; When calm, do as we did before. Ev'n GOD's choice Worthies, when releast From Suffrings, fouly have transgrest; If in this, or some other kind, They were not often disciplin'd. He, that with troubles hem'd about, The Battels of the LORD had fought Unfoil'd; assoon as he had ease, (Neglecting such like means as these) Did grofly fall; and so shall we, When idle and secure we be. Had he been musing on GOD's Law When in her Bath, he naked saw Uriahs Wife; or, at that time Composing of a Psalm or Hymn, It had secur'd him from that sin, Which let a lustful Devil in. LORD! that I be not so surpriz'd, (Though these my Musings are despis'd) Preserve me, (whether weal or wo Befalls me) still imployed so; Or, in what else thou please, that's tending To keep me alwayes from offending: And to thy Glory, and to my Salvation, Vouchsafe to sanctifie this Meditation. III. To those who enquire, why this Author is now imprisoned in Newgate? Into this Jayl, you ask me, why I'm thrown? But to my self that is not fully known; Unless it may be charged as a Crime, For putting Truth and Reason into Rime; Or, giving unto some, for doing wrong, Such Epithites as unto them belong; Which is by very few thought criminal, And, by most men, to be no fault at all. Yet, since you are my Friends, I bold will make To give you Counsel, which I could not take: Touch not a gald Jades back, although it be To cure him, if you will be rul'd by me; And if your Conscience force you not thereto, No notice take, when other men misdo. For, they, who most ungodly courses run, (And boast of what they wickedly have done) So rage at him, who dares to reprehend Their Actions, howsoever they offend, That oft-times by their pow'r they bring on him, Those Penalties which were deserv'd by them. A Whore profest, though she would have men know She is a Whore, will not be called so. (Yea, though she could not live, were it not known She lived by abusing of her own) But, be fo wroth with him, who so shall say, That she will scratch his eyes out, if she may: At least, if she can do no more, will rayl; Or, had she pow'r, commit him to the Jayl, And for a Sland'rer prosecute him there, As justly, as they do, who keep me here. IV. A Hymn of Thanksgiving, for deliverance from a dangerous and sharp Sickness, during his Imprisonment. [1] LORD! they who thy Affection measure By what thou givest into their possessings, Of Riches, Honours, or of Pleasure, Or, of such other Temporary Blessings, And mark how here thou deal'st with me, May think I am despis'd of thee; For, when I seem'd opprest before With losse of Liberty and Wealth, So that I could well bear no more, Thou thereto addedst loss of health, Imbitter'd and made sharp, with as much pain As Flesh and Blood were able to sustain. 2 Yet neither was thy Love impaired, Whilst in that manner I afflicted was, Nor doubted I, nor ought despaired Of thy continuing and assisting Grace; But, as the violence and length Of pain deprived me of strength, My Spirit thereby stronger grew; Yea, so thou didst my Faith encrease; (So Fortitude and hope renew) That Suffrings were not pleasureless; Because I knew I underwent thy Rod, Who art as well my Father, as my GOD: 3 I know thee not alone by hearing, But, also by thy being in my heart, And, by thy thereunto declaring, How just, wise, good, and merciful thou art: Thou tak'st no pleasure in our pain, Nor dost, nor ever didst constrain The soul of any to a path, Which leads him from a happy course, To Sin, Shame, Sorrow, or to Death, Or, renders his condition worse. For, that thou more delighted art to save, Than to destroy, I good assurance have. 4 For ever, let thy Name be blessed; For, when my patience did begin to fail, And pain, a cold-sweat forth had pressed, As if in me, fire had been mixt with hail; Thou in my first Fit, easedst me By means, lest means despis'd might be: And when I was shut up alone, Of all external helps depriv'd, (Where means of Cure or Ease was none) Then, by thy Self I was reliev'd; That I might alwayes confident be made Of thy help, when no other can be had. 5 When so extreamly I was pained, That I could hardly for one minutes space, Endure the torment I sustained, In any posture, or in any place, Thou hug'dst me fast asleep; and then Gav'st Ease, I know not how, nor when; Which so amazed me, when I awak't, That, I at first, could hardly tell Whether, I for a Dream might tak't, Or, whether I were sick or well; For, in the fire I thought assoon I might Have slept (erewhile) as in my bed that night. 6 Therefore, to thee, for this Compassion I do now consecrate a Hymn of Praise: Be pleas'd, O GOD of my Salvation, To be thus my Physician all my dayes. Let this preserve me from the fear Of what I may yet suffer here: And when this Mercy shall be known, Thereby assur'd let others be That such Compassion shall be shown To them, as was vouchsaf'd to me, If in thy Truth and Fear they shall abide, And, without wavering, in thee confide. V. To them who say, or suppose, that a vain desire of Fame, was this Authors principal motive, to the Composure of what he hath written and published. I hear, some think (and, for their sakes am sorry They think so) that Ambition of vain glory Is that, which principally moves my Pen To dare more than the Quills of wiser men; And, that an itch for popular Applause Was of my bold Reproofs the chiefest cause. If this be true, I am as mad as they Who think so, and take the nearest way To my destruction, for a windy puff, Which in a moment will be quite blown off, And leave me comfortless, in that condition Which threatens inavoidable perdition. But, these will find their error, when they know By tryal, from what Root my Actings flow; And that I had in what I have exprest, A nobler Aim, than meer self-Interest, Or any outward ends, although in them, My own well-being I shall not contemn. I am not ignorant that whatsoever I actively or passively endeavour, To honour GOD, or for my Countries good, May, to my dammage, be misunderstood; Nor that most men, mis-censure what I've writ To be Composures without fear or wit; And that, if I should be thereby undone, (Which likely seems) I may be thought upon With very small regard, alive or dead; Or any way at all be mentioned, Except by some few, who perhaps will say, I fool'd my Liberty and Life away. But should I minded be, when I shall have My portion among other in the Grave, What greater share shall I have in that Fame, Which after Death might memorize my Name, Than they, who in Oblivion lie forgot, Where Pen nor Tongue their Actions mention not? In my time, sixteen persons I have known Who did my Christian and my Surname own, And one Captain George Wither, a man valiant and witty, and one of the sixteen here mentioned, was hewed to death at Kingston upon Hull by his own Soldiers in their fury, because he had killed one of their fellows in the like fury. of them oft guilty prov'd to be Of Crimes, imputed falsly unto me, By those who knew us not; and he, whilst here He lived, had in my repute a share: But, after few years, none will know, among All these, to which of us, those things belong Which we have acted. Nay, though ten times more I had deserv'd (than any heretofore, Made memorable by a glorious Fame) A feigned person, who no real Name Or Being ever had, save what, perchance, Was thereunto ascrib'd in some Romance, May seem to be more honour'd by that fiction, Than any who attain'd the high'st perfection In Piety or Morals: For, I've seen Some Readers, with such Legends to have been So far transported, that it them could move More sighs and tears, compassion, honour, love, Esteem and admiration, to confer On those Idea's, than bestowed are On real Suff'rers, who, did undertake To do and suffer freely for their sake. And what a trivial prize or purchase then Is an esteem, or vain applause of men? My Actings have expos'd me, during life, To hazards, losses, much reproach and Grief; And, what shall I the better be, or worse, When I am dead, whether men bless or curse, Speak well or ill, that I should quite destroy, For such toyes, what in life I might enjoy? By being silent, I preserv'd from blame Might be, and more esteem'd than now I am. If I could for advantage swear and lie, And flatter Fools and Knaves in Elegy: Sure, he who shall observe, as I have done, What scorns, and what despights I've undergone; What I have felt, and what I do fore-see Will probably on Earth my Wages be, Yet thinks I run these hazards for vain Fame, Must likewise, either think, that mad I am, Or, that I've only learned in the School Of long Experience, to be more than Fool. But, though most are deceiv'd in their Design, And in their thoughts, I am not so in mine. I know my Work; I likewise know that End Whereto it doth, or at least, ought to tend: And, therefore hope, that till my lifes conclusion, I shall be kept from such a gross delusion. He, that for GOD's Cause, or for his Elects, Pretends to do, or suffer; yet, expects More honour, or ought else, than his just share With them, who of the same Communion are; Expects more than his due; Exceeds the bound Of that self-love which in true Saints is found, And, what he acts, or suffers, no Reward. Can merit; for, he forfeits his Reward. All, that he shall endeavour, on that score, When Rich he thinks to be, will make him Poor; And, by what he expected to be fam'd, He shall become contemptible and sham'd. GOD's Mind, I therefore study to fulfill, Seeking no Pay, but what, and when he will: And, knowing that's my Aim, much care I not What, in this world, he gives to be my Lot. I no more value Praises, than Reproach; And, whether in a Carr, or in a Coach, I ride to my last home, I little care, So with a quiet Conscience I come there. If well in life I use them, 'tis no matter, How far asunder men my Limbs do scatter, Or in what Publick place they set my Head, To terrifie some fools, when I am dead: For, ev'ry part of me will meet together, When GOD shall pleased be to call me thither, Where CHRIST now sits inthron'd; and whither he Ascended to prepare a place for me. I prize nor Life, nor Death, but, as thereby, I, more or less, GOD's Name may glorifie. And, whilst my own heart knows this to be so, I care not, whether 'tis believ'd or no By any man, unless, that, to infuse The like mind into him, it may conduce. If, I have acted for a worthless prize, Learn by my foolishness to be more wise. If I have aim'd to suffer, or to do For such ends as I should, do ye so too. Because then, what you heretofore of me Misdeem'd, will thenceforth your advantage be; And, no more harm to me, than that man found, Who had an Ulcer cured by a Wound. VI. A Meditation, occasioned by considering the manifold Temptations to distrust in GOD, whereby his best Servants are otherwhile proved and exercised. The best of men, some failings have; and I, Not only many; through Infirmity; But, flowing also from those Negligences, Which very much have heightned my offences; Because I know, what pow'r to me he gave, To do those things which I neglected have: Especially, when my Distrustfulness Hath made me doubtful of GOD's Promises. Who, to assure them, hath vouchsafed both A written Word, and seal'd it with an Oath; And, also, new experiments, which may Ascertain it, vouchsafeth ev'ry day. David, the most couragious Combatant Against such-like Temptations, did oft want That Confidence, which was by him profest, And, thereby hazarded his Interest In GOD's free Promises. By Saul, said he, One time or other I destroy'd shall be; And, what was promised, had so outright Forgotten, in his carnal pannick fright, That to GOD's Foes he for protection ran, The part there acting of a frantick man, And of a drivling fool; yea, worse than so, Dissembled then, yet scap'd with much ado. That Course, whereby he thought to be assur'd Of safety, an indangerment procur'd Beyond all former hazards; for, he lost Not only Goods, Wives, and all hope almost Of Rescue, but was also like to lose His Life, and to be ston'd by some of those (In their distemper) who inrag'd became, To see their Habitations in a flame, Their dear'st Relations captiv'd, and to those Inslav'd, who were their old malignant Foes. In which strait, if GOD had not him befriended, Whom he distrusted, there, his Life had ended. There is our Case; for, though that many times, Our Fears, our Foes, our Troubles, and our Crimes We have, beyond hope, been deliver'd from, And promised in ev'ry time to come, That like deliverance; yet, when ought fails Which we expected, or a Foe prevails, (For our probation) we are hurried streight Into a causless, and a foolish fright; GOD's promised Assistance we decline, Catch hold of any politick Design, Run this, and that way, to the World, the Devil For help and Counsel, or act any evil In such a giddy fit, though we have seen, And often felt, what those effects have been Which will ensue. Nay, if long time we bear A present suffring, and new troubles fear, Our Faith is at a stand, and we begin Immediately to let Despairings in; Make Principle of Faith, give way to Reason, And seem Phanatick Whimsies, out of season, Or airy Refuges, beseeming none In straits, but meer Fools, to depend upon. Though in the Saints of old to fall off thus, It was a Crime; 'tis greater sin in us, By so much, as the sinning against Grace Doth our transgressions of the Law surpass: And, neither Theft, Adultery, or Murder, From GOD and Penitence will draw us further, If we avoid it not: For, to be made More cautelous, we have not only had Examples of old times, and seen since then, What hath befallen many thousand men In such defections, but, we likewise are Experienc'd in our own particular Estates and persons, what will them betide, Who in the dayes of Tryal start aside, And, by the Gospel are enlightned more, Than other Generations heretofore. This, makes me, in my present troubles, wave Those wayes, whereto I some Temptations have, My person to redeem; and to prevent The future mischiefs, that seem eminent, This makes me scorn, to creep, or fawn, or sneak, Or, (whatsoere I threatned hear) to speak To an unworthy person, though I could Prevail, perhaps, upon him, if I would: For, were my Poverty ten times as much, The King of Sodom shall not make me rich; Nor, were I sick to death, would I implore Those false Gods, which most men do now adore For health or life, though I thought they could give That, which I most desired to receive. This, among other Notions of this kind, (Which needful are to fortifie my mind Amid my Suffrings) makes me muse on these Our common failings, that, if GOD so please, They may be by his Grace, with my endeavour, A means to keep me firm to him for ever; And, by declaring what Experiment Hath taught to me, make others confident In suffrings for his Cause: and, not afraid What is, or what can here on them be laid: For, as where many Cowards are together, They still beget more terrours in each other; So men of Courage, more couragious grow, When, to each other, they example show Of Christian Fortitude: To which good end, These fruits of my spare howers I intend. VII. Another Scrap, to them, who carp at this Author's frequent writing. VVhy should you be displeas'd, and have a loathing, Of that which may do good, and cost you nothing? Or, which you may pass by, without offence, Or, giving you occasion of expence, Unless you please? For, that which I compose, On no man, I against his will, impose. GOD is our Shield, our Fortress, and that Friend On whom alone we alway should depend; Yet, he expects an Activeness in those, On whom a Christian Armour he bestows; And, that we put it on, when there's occasion Of War defensive, or, of an Invasion; As also, that, we alwayes keep it clean, And our selves ready, by good discipline: For, of their Talents they will be bereav'd, Who make not use of what they have receiv'd: Yea, they will be surpriz'd, who, times and places Neglect, wherein to exercise their Graces, When means is offred; since it will make room And entrance for Temptations when they come, If we are negligent in doing that, Which to our Perseverance doth relate. The Roman Legions, which resided here, (When no foes to oppose them did appear) Bestow'd their spare hours with much diligence, In making Preparations for defence In times of need; New Fortresses did raise, Built Bridges, Causeys, and made easie wayes For future Marches, whereby, to and fro In safety, they, and other men might go. And, we must do the like, if we would be From future dangers and surprizals free; To which end, things that seem of little use At present, may hereafter much conduce. Our Patience will wear out, our Courage slack; Our Spirits faint, and cause us to draw back From needful Suffrings, unless in some measure VVe daily shall improve spare time and leasure, To fortifie our hearts by meditation, VVhich is the nourishment and preservation Of Hope and Faith. This, when my Friends are gon, (VVhose Consolations I do feast upon VVhilst they are present) if I those can void, VVith whose Impertinences I am cloyd, Moves me to gather up, that, into words, VVhich their and my Experiment affords; Lest that be lost, which else might serve in stead Of Cordials at a sudden time of need. This, moves me, when my Foes threat and revile, To muster thus (as 'twere in rank and file) My scatter'd thoughts; and then to march up close Ev'n to the Vanguard of my furioust Foes: For, when we look grim Terrors in the face Without dismay, it makes them to give place. And, though the Champions of the world do laugh To see my weapons, but a Sling, a Staff, And Peble-stones; they will prevail, when they Shall either perish, or else run away. This moves me (when alone) lest else the Devil, Or my own Flesh may tempt me to some evil, (VVhen they shall idling find me) to retire Into my self, and search what vain desire, VVhat hope, or fear, or doubtings there do lurk, VVhich either may advance, or counterwork Those Principles of Grace, which by good use And practice, I to habits may reduce. This, that those Notions may not fly away, VVhich I find helpful, makes me oft imploy My leasure times, in what, it seems, hath so Increast my Scriblings, that they nauceous grow To many Readers; and, perhaps to some, VVho might by them advantaged become. But I am pleas'd; for, that, my tast delights, Which is disgustfull to their Appetites; And what at this time they disrelish, may Yeeld profit with delight, another day. VIII. An Eccho from the Thunders, in the celestial Temple, reverberating, in part, the effect of what was uttered by their Voices. Six Trumpets have been sounded forth, Six Vials poured on the Earth, Six Thunders have their Voices spent; Yet, they blaspheme, who should repent, And night and day a direfull cry, Still beating on my ears have I, Of men opprest between their paws, Whose God is Gain, whose Lusts are Laws; And, dreadful sounds of Vengeance too Are eccho'd wheresoev'r I go. Though men are deaf, yet speak I must: Hear therefore, lifeless forms of dust, And sensless things, that ye may bear Your Witness to what I declare: For, what hereafter shall ensue Will make deep stamps on some of you. Wo, wo, ere long to C. C. C. To P. P. P. P. P. and P. Like Wo to S. to M. and L. For, they have made this Earth a Hell, Wherein, unless Christ quickly comes, Few Good men shall have resting rooms; And little Faithfulness will here Be found, when he shall next appear. But Time hath almost wheel'd that round, Wherein the seventh Trump will sound. And then shall Righteousness alone, With Pow'r and Glory fill the Throne, That JESUS, who (when by his Birth He was first visible on Earth) Much troubled Herod, and with him The City of Jerusalem; And is that Universal Prince, Of whom all Tyrants ever since Have been afraid, will come ere long, To set that right, which now is wrong, And put an end to their Oppression, VVho charge his Subjects with Sedition: For, though some slighted them when they were seen, His Harbengers have here already been. IX. A brief Reproof of them, who take pleasure in Scandalous Invectives, whereby others are personally defamed. There is a mangie Humour and an Itch, (At this day very troublesome) with which Most men are so infected, that unless We find a speedy cure, 'twill so increase, And leave so few from this Contagion free, That we shall all appear meer Scabs to be. Now, there is nothing more delights the ear, Than when it shall those vilified hear, Whom they affect not, whether they are blam'd Without just cause, or worthily defam'd; Especially, if those in ought dissent From their Opinions, (Although eminent For many Virtues, and with them agree In all things, which with Truth essential be.) And, since our Diffrences did us divide, Few men there are of note on either side, Of good or ill desert; but (right or wrong) They so aspersed are by Pen or Tongue; And Truth, if spoke, so blended is with lyes, With fraud, or else with Ambiguities, That, if what is in Pamphlets published, Should be hereafter by our Children read, They'l think this Age (if they do credit it) Had neither Honour, Honesty, nor Wit; So scurrilous, and so malevolent Are their Invectives, and so impudent. There are of Truths and Falshoods put together, Such medlies made, without respect to either, And misappli'd in such a barbrous wise, Mens Persons or their Cause to scandalize, That, whether they did wickedly, or well, They, in their outward Fames are parallel; And, frequently, by seeming to intend That, which may their Antagonist befriend, A Foe disguiz'd, destruction doth devise For them, whom he pretends to patronize: Shews make of Peace, where they bear no Goodwill, And, those to save, whom they intend to kill. This Bitterness and Falshood multiplies Those Discords and those Animosities, Which have thus far undone us, and this course Will make that which is bad, grow daily worse, Until it shall exasperate this Nation Beyond all means of Reconciliation; For, till there shall as much respect be shown To other mens Good-names, as to our own, And, we are pleas'd to hear good spoke of those Who well deserve, although they are our Foes, We never shall be Friends; nor friendship merit From any, till we qualifie this spirit. 'Tis gentle speaking that appeaseth Wrath; A bitter language, no such virtue hath. Yet, let none think, this means to usher-in A Reprehension of reproving Sin, Or, that, it well beseems not any man To render Vice as odious as he can: For, no debasement can make Wickedness More ugly, than essentially it is. Though just Reproofs have not allowed been, Where persons are more aim'd at, than their sin. Their Practice, Justice doth to none allow, Who at their Neighbours, from an unseen Bow, Shoot poysned Arrows; and, Bandetti-like, The Passengers from such a Covert strike, That none can truly know how they are nam'd, Or where those dwell, by whom they are defam'd. In taxing Vices, let nor Tongue nor Pen Act sparingly; but spare alone the men, (As much as possible) unless they shall Ingage themselves, by quarrels personal Against the Truth; Then spare them only so, That thereby Truth may not receive a blow. A causless Scandal, nor a Lie, admit, Though thereby Truth may some advantage get; For, she or they, will honour lose thereby, Who think to do her service by a Lie. Some Good-men (not a little to their shame) I fear are this way otherwhile to blame, As much as they whose refuge is in Lyes, (And care not by what means they gain their Prize) For, when that an Impostor doth express What some-way suiteth with what they profess; Oft-times by that Wile, guilded Pills are swallow'd As wholsom, which are poysned and unhallow'd, And, them deprive, who are deluded so, Of outward peace, and Peace of Conscience too. Take therfore heed of those, who by their mingling Truths with apparant Falshoods, and by gingling Some Silver among Counters, may by shows Of their befriending that, which they oppose, Obtrude upon you somewhat that is evil, Relating unto things Divine or Civil; At least, to make you hearken with content, To what brings undeserv'd Disparagement On other men: For, all things baneful prove, Wherein there's want of Prudence, Faith, or Love. X. A Disclaim, by way of Advertisement, of a Paper, falsly imputed to this Author. There are Verses printed on one side of a sheet, Intituled, The Wheel of Time turning round to the Good Old Cause; which many, who know not me, nor my Principles, nor my Writings from other mens, have ascribed unto me, who do abhor publishing any thing without my Name, which may be scandalous; especially to individual persons, either by name, or by marking them out in such manner, that the Vices I reprove can be justly appropriated to them, and to no other: Neither did I ever purposly compose ought which might endanger the publick Peace, or hazard the quiet of private persons, whereof that Paper is suspected. And indeed, I conceived it at the first view, to have been the composure of a malicious person, who thereby intended to make those in Authority jealous of some Innovation intended by sober and conscientious men, who I hope will make patient suffering their Refuge, in all their Probations. Therefore, as soon as I had perused it, I wrote these following Verses on the backside thereof, and gave it unto a Friend, to communicate thereby my sense thereof, to others, if he pleased. He, that divulgeth ought without a Name, Which individual persons doth defame, Although the Truth he writes, deserveth blame: Yea, he, that without soberness and reason, Speaks what is true, and speaks it out of season, Against the Dignity of Truth speaks Treason. Yet, Saints, may by oppressions, now and then Be so provoked (for they are but men) That, they may thus offend by Tongue or Pen. If it be so, let him who forth hath sent Those Lines, his folly heartily repent; For, they portend an Evil-Consequent. G. W. XI. To them who object it as a fault, that this Author hath written several Poems, since he resolved to write no more. I sometimes think my work is done, and then Resolved am to lay aside my Pen; Yet, when I do discover some remain Unfinished, I take it up again: For, when I promise, what concerneth none (In any manner) but my self alone, 'Tis alwayes in mine own pow'r, to dispense With ev'ry such Resolve, without offence; Then, specially, when else, perhaps, I may To GOD, my self, or others in some way Infringe my Duty, by the prosecution Of that unprofitable Resolution. For this cause therefore, I now think it fit, Not only such Resolvings to remit, But, also, by these Presents, to declare That, whensoere a just Cause doth appear, To write, or speak, or do, what I believe GOD may have honour by, or Men receive A future benefit, I will assay (Whilst I have life) to do it as I may. This Promise binds me; and, I must confess, That, if in time to come, I shall transgress Against this Resolution, there's in me No pow'r whereby I from it can be free. Reprove me therefore, if at any time I break this Promise; for it is a crime. XII. Of Governours and Governments; and how we ought to demean our selves toward them. All Pow'r is of the Lord, the GOD of Heav'n; And Man hath none, but, that which he hath giv'n: To raise, pull down, to change or innovate, In governing a Kingdom, or a State, Belongs to Him alone; and nought to do Have private men, but to submit thereto When He a Change hath made, whether he hath Vouchsafed it in Mercy, or in Wrath. Therefore, the Persons, or the Government, To change I never sought, nor had intent; But, to submit to that, what ev'r it be, Which GOD was pleased to set over me. Both Men and Forms, if well compar'd together, Do prove so like, and so unlike each other, That oft the Constitution which at first Appear'd the best, becomes at last the worst; And, as the Elements do change into Each other, so the Governments will do, According to th'Affections, and the Pow'rs Of those, who are the present Governours. All kinds of Government, in some respect, Are but one and the self-same in effect, And, when refined, will corrupt agen, So long as actuated by meer men, Who, overswayed by their Lusts and Passions, Are alwayes subject to Prevarications, And so oft also, as the People's sin Compels GOD's Justice to bring Changes in. This, when the Supream Pow'r was here divided (So, that some this way, and some that way sided) Made many Wise-men, both in resolution, As also in their wayes of prosecution, Exceeding doubtfull, that a sad Result Might follow, in a path so difficult; I therefore, then, endeavoured to adhere To that, wherein most Justice did appear When I had cause of doubt; and did comply Where I saw with most visibility That Pow'r did then reside: For, so I thought (And still believe) I was divinely taught By Precept and Examples; and I joyn'd Therein, to those, who seeming of that mind And judgment, did in shew the same profess With zeal, and with much conscienciousness. And, some few, doubtless, acted to that end Sincerely, which the rest did but pretend. But, I was cozned by the greater part: Yet, went on in simplicity of heart, Till I so far into a snare was run, That, back I could not go, nor further on Without a Mischief; or, a breach had made Upon that Faith which I engaged had. For, few I saw pursuing any thing Concerning GOD, the People, or the King, With true integrity, to which-soere Of those three they pretended to adhere, With whether side soever they then closed, Or, whatsoever they in shew proposed. I saw, that either by an open scuffling, Or, by a politick and secret shuffling, Both sides had so the Knaves and Court-cards laid, That cheating Games were likely to be plaid, And, that our Losses, who intended best, Would be the losing of our Stakes at least. Some, for Religion did pretend to fight; Some, for the Royal, some for Common-Right; But, I perceiv'd Self-Interest was that Which principally most men aimed at; And had not thereof a bare jealousie, For, 'twas apparant by that Policy With which they prosecuted their Intent. What else by them could probably be meant, Who jugling with both sides, to none were true, But as their own advantage might ensue? Who, siding with one Party, sent a Brother, A Son, or else a Nephew to the other; Who mutually did their Designs advance With Correspondence, and with Maintenance? With Counsels and with Treasure strengthning those Unseen, whom they did openly oppose? And otherwhile, by murdring their own Friends, Made bloody passages to their self-ends? Thus did they, yet, some of those now appear In better case, than we, whose Actings were Most innocent. But, though we suffer first, The better seeming Game will prove the worst. For my part, though it cost me all I had To keep my Conscience clear, a shift I made; And, am as well contented with my Lot, As they are, who have by my Losses got. Trust rather therefore thine own Conscience, then Upon the Counsel of sev'n wiser men: For, in a dubious path, no humane light So well directs us how to walk upright, If so far forth as GOD doth means provide, We take his Word and Spirit for our Guide. Be faithful to the present Government That GOD permits, to whatsoere intent He doth permit it, or what-ere it be; For, (as I said) LORD of all Pow'r is He; And, ev'ry Government is good, save when It is usurped by unrighteous men; And, we must bear it then, till he shall please Who laid it on us, to vouchsafe us ease; Because (though He permitteth it) our Sin Was that, yea that alone, which brought it in. We may, and must endeavour in our places, (According to those Talents and those Graces Which GOD bestows) to offer that which may Help keep them in a safe and Righteous way, For their sakes and our own; and, without fear, Speak to that end, what we shall know or hear, (Though they offended be) so we apply Our Balm with prudence and sobriety. Our seeking to reform it, by a course Not lawful, will but make it much the worse; Whereas, if we with patience do attend On GOD, he'l better, what we cannot mend, Or, else, with His own hand, destroy it quite, Ev'n when their Tyranny is at the height. These are my Principles: These, without fear, Have kept me, and will keep me still, who ere Shall govern me; and whether Right or Wrong. Be done me either little-while, or long. XIII. A Scrap added to the former, since the sending of the Authors Remonstrance to the house of Commons. Though Liberty I've lost, with my Estate, Yet, as things are, I wonder not thereat; Nor marvel that my Poem, for which here I suffer, to the World must not appear: For, I confess, it speaks not in a strain, Which Flatt'rers with esteem can entertain; And they by whom I have accused been, Would miss their Aim, were that in Publick seen; Occasion likewise I should not have had, Of that advantage, which is thereby made. But, one thing (which till now I thought not fit To mention) I admir'd at, and do yet; Ev'n this, That, being of all else bereft, The same Tools in my pow'r should still be left, VVhereby offence was given, and by which My Vindication will be further'd much. It was a Mercy, but, sure, not of men, That, I bereaved was not of my Pen When I was first restrain'd, and also sent, (As many are) to close Imprisonment; Which, at this time had greater mischief done, Than all that I, till now have undergone. And this, I here express, not to outbrave Mans fury, but, that GOD may Glory have By that Assurance, wherewith, me he arms In present suffrings, against future harms. For that cause, in this manner, is reveal'd That, which a wiser man would have conceal'd; And, though, I somewhat over peremptory May seem; yet, when Truths honour, and GOD's Glory Do lie at stake, I know a servile speaking To be a foolish and uncomly sneaking; Not onely disadvantaging the speaker, But, rendring also righteous Causes weaker. All men to Casualties exposed be, And, things befall to others, as to me; Ev'n unto them, who are above my sphear, And, were occasion of my lodging here. When I had been above six months, debar'd Of Liberty, unpitti'd, and unheard; Accus'd for Libelling, because I had A private Recapitulation made Of what I knew, as well by sight as fame, (And, for which, yet, unheard, confin'd I am) Five Persons, of no mean degree, were sent To be my Fellows by Imprisonment Within this Jayl; and, at this present are Charg'd with suspition of no less Crimes here Than Theft and Murder; And, there's one among That number, which at this time doth belong To that Society, which I am said To have defam'd, and therefore here was laid; Though I in private only, had declar'd In genral terms, what common fame aver'd. And, which now seem not so incredible As they were thought, nor things impossible. Yet, with unfeignedness, desire I do, They may be guiltless found, if they be so, And quit, without endeavouring to smother Two Crimes, by perpetrating of another: For, guilt to cover, and damn Innocents, Is not in these dayes without Presidents: And, Presidents (although not worth a straw) By some are made equivolent to Law. Their Youth I greatly pitty, though the Rage Of my Oppressors pitty not my Age, Nor care to what straights I may be exposed, Whilst here, despis'd of all, I am inclosed. Now they, and I, until we shall be try'd All scandalous conjectures must abide; And, if upon the Test, their Act appears Mistook; why may not mine as well as theirs Mistaken be? since I more likely am Than they, by Prejudice to suffer blame? And have lesse outward means of vindication, From an unjust and causless imputation? But, they, and I, shall have, when our time's come, That, which GOD hath appointed for our Doom. He will be Righteous, though men are not so; Whatere He pleases, therefore let Him do. We, by the Justice, which will then be done, Shall know, what's likely to ensue thereon To other men, who live in expectation Of Justice, or of due Commiseration. And, if with meekness, upon GOD we rest, That, which threats worst things, will produce the best. They whom I have displeas'd, may now be merry; For, I have scribled until I am weary: And shall, perhaps, no more be troublesome This way, when what's conceiv'd to light shal come; But, then permit them from thenceforth, to do What they intend, till they are weary too. In this mode I have little more to offer, To say, or do, but down to lye and suffer; Assur'd, that (if no good effects that have Which I have writ) A Poem in my Grave Compos'd and hither sent, would be no more Effectual, than my Writings heretofore. I have exprest enough to men of Reason, Who know when sober Truths come forth in season: Now, therefore, if GOD please, let them who shall Desire them, take Pen, Credit, Life, and all; But let them therewith know, that they will be So dealt withall, as they shall deal with me. 'Tis now known, what I've done, what I can say, And, what I suffer, but not what I may. Qui jacet in Terrâ, non habet undé cadet. “The World can him undo no more, “Whom she hath quite undone before: “But, he whom GOD shall smile upon, “May lose all, yet not be undone. A few Lines more I'le add: I hear some say, This will occasion rending quite away All Liberties at once, and many think, That henceforth neither Paper, Pen, nor Ink Will be allow'd me, nor a Visitant, Which may supply me with what I shall want: Yea, that I may be thither sent, where none Shall see, or hear, what must be undergone; And, that nought can be hop'd for, but Perdition In such a place, and such a sad condition. Yet, this I fear not: For, there is no place On Earth, or any such distressed case, As no Redress admits. There's not alone For ev'ry Grief, a Cure, for ev'ry one In ev'ry Country; But, each man about him Hath also that, within him, or without him, Which known, and by GOD's aid applied, cures All Maladies, and all Distemperatures. The greatest Tyrants pow'r extends not to All those things, which he hath a Will to do. Nor is there any Misery, or Place Whereby I can be shut up from GOD's Grace. What more I may now, or hereafter bear, Increases not my terrour or my care: Nay, so far am I from the dread of that Which may befall in such a sad estate; That when I think on what the Rage of men Shall do at worst; And what GOD will do then, It keeps me pleas'd. For, to deliver me (What ere betides) a thousand wayes hath he. He, that can make safe passage through the Seas, And, through a Fiery Furnace, if He please, Pre-apprehensions gives me, of that Grace Which will vouchsafed be in such a Case. Joseph was long in Prison; yet GOD sent A means to free him from Imprisonment, In such a mode, that, if within our Creed It be, 'twill very well deserve our heed. The World can neither bring me to dispair, Nor me deprive of Hope, Faith, Love, or Prayr; Nor take away, or unto me restore Ought, making my Assurance less or more. GOD clothes the Lillies, and doth Sparrows feed; He can turn Stones to Bread, if there be need: And, could I down to Hell by men be driven, When I came thither, I should find it Heaven. The Bugbears, wherewithall the World assays To skare me, could not in my childish dayes Affright me. I was exerciz'd in youth (For loving Honesty, and writing Truth) With strict Imprisonments, and made ere since A Stone (to very many) of offence, Kickt to and fro, till thereat many broke Their shins at least, yet harm I never took. GOD hath preserved me now fifty years, In his Work, in all troubles, wants and fears; From Poverty and Shame in worst of times; From mine own Follies, Vanities and Crimes; From Famines, Pestilences, raging War, And Tyrants, worse than those three Judgments are, Without dismay, ev'n when it so befell, That men in greatest pow'r sped not so well. In plain terms I did often represent Their failings, to the late Long Parliament, Yet scap't their fury, though I could not scape Their Fraud, nor Partnership in that mishap, Which their Improvidence occasion'd then, Both to themseves, and many better men. But, that will for my welfare prove at last, As certainly, as that which in time past, I told them would befall, is at this day Fulfill'd upon them, ev'ry sev'ral way; And, will continue, till their Fiery Tryal, Hath brought men to that real self-denial, Which them will qualifie to carry on The Work which GOD intendeth shall be done. I likewise did presage to Oliver, In bold words to his face, and without fear, What would at last befall him: and I knew (Though he dissembled it) what would ensue For such plain-dealing: yea, I soon did find, By what course my destruction was design'd; But, whilst he thought, I thought my self befriended, GOD taught me to prevent what he intended, That, I might suffer, as now at this time, What gives more cause of glorifying Him. By these Experiments confirm'd I am, My GOD will alwayes be to me the same, That he hath been, and ratifie that Truth In my old Age, that I believ'd in Youth, By making that, which likely seems to double My sorrows, to help others in their trouble, VVith constancy and patience to sustain Their Burdens, whilst upon them they remain. And, peradventure, they will be so wise, VVhose Indignation, yet upon me lies, That, when they heed what GOD for me hath done, And may do, they'l consider so thereon, That they who were my Foes, my Friends will be, And save themselves, by their deliv'ring me. GOD can effect this for me, if He please: For, He doth many stranger things than these. But, let Him do his Will. VVhat ere is done, He is my Trust, and, Him I'le rest upon. If such a Famine, as is threatned, comes, There will be need of such like Scraps and Crums. But, these, to none can toothsome be, unless They thirst and hunger after Righteousness: For, they will relish unto all men els, Like fleshless bones, or fishless Oyster-shels: Perhaps, to some few, they will serve instead Of Physical Receipts in time of need, If, carelesly they be not cast aside, But, prudently and seasonably apply'd. To that end, they endeavoured to save them From being lost, by whose means ye now have them. They Relicts are of that continual Feast My Conscience makes me; and probatum est To ev'ry one of them subscribe I may; For I have proved them by night and day. They are but part of larger Meditations (Thus worded, for my daily Recreations) For whilst to write them down, I did assay, The greatest portion of them flew away. Verses written by Mr. George Wither upon three Trenchers with Oker, during his close-Imprisonment, and carried to the Lieutenant of the Tower by the said Prisoners Keeper. George Wither, close Prisoner, to the Lieut. of the Tower. Sir, I have been a Prisner now six times, For no worse faults, than just Reproofs of Crimes. Nigh fifty years acquainted with the pow'r Of Jaylors; and, shall shortly know the Tower, To be the best, or else the worst of all Confinements, which did hitherto befall. All my defensive Arms are took away, Now therefore, I assume such as I may; And, since my Lot affords no better Tools, A Trencher mark't with Oker, Lead, or Coals, Shall be my Buckler, Sword, and Advocate To you, in this my much opprest estate. These, long experience taught me to provide, When such a strait was likely to betide; And, if you take them from me, you will do More than your Order doth oblige you to, Or Charity allows: for, I'm not free To come to you, nor will you come at me; Though wise, and good, and honourable men, Have thought me worth a visit (now and then.) When I was in the much despised Jayl Of Newgate; some from thence were freed by Bail, Though charg'd with Theft &amp; Murder; and I may Expect that Priviledge as well as they: But, kissing goes by favour; and I lack The Silver Key, which way thereto doth make, And by the want whereof, I find this place Affords not unto me, the common grace Allow'd to Rogues; nor so much as a Slave In Turky, or in Barbary may have: For, they have Bread and Water at the least, And Place assigned them, wherein to rest, VVithout extorting more than can be had (Unless their Flesh could into Coyn be made) VVhereas the Mercy which this place affords (In Age and Sickness) had been naked boards, And stones for bread, had not my Wife, by giving VVhat Charity bestow'd to keep her living, Prevented for a week, what was design'd To me, thence-forward, if we cannot find Enough beforehand, weekly to bring in, And save the stripping of me to the skin: By which means, that Impeachment now intended, May not be drawn up, till my Life is ended; So, they will lose their labour, who assay To mould my Punishment another way; VVhich I conceiv'd, would more vexation be To some, than all my Suffrings are to me. Prisners should gently used be, (if mild) Not currishly oppressed and revil'd: For (though neglected) we have still a Law, VVhereby such Jaylors may be kept in awe. Know, Sir, that much abuse to me is done; Which is not an Abuse to me alone, But likewise to your self, and to the nature And priviledge of ev'ry humane creature. For which cause, being willing to prevent, Both your Dishonour, and my Detriment, I this way have contrived to declare My mind; and that, I my Affronts can bear; Though (to my knowledge) since my name was Wither I was not Villain call'd, till I came hither; Nor from ought, for preserving health, debarr'd; Though, oft my usage hath been very hard. The mercy of preceding times was such, That Prisners here, were not opprest so much: For, all Close-Prisners, (for what Crime soere Accus'd) suppli'd with all things needful were In their degrees; ev'n at the Princes cost: Which Priviledge, though now it seemeth lost, Custom had made so legally then due, That, till of late, it was deny'd to few. And, whensoever claim'd, your Predecessors, If they denyed it, were thought Transgressors. They who infring'd that Custom, first, did bring Dishonour to the Nation, and the King. Them, closely to imprison, who have nought To feed them (and thereof, then take no thought) Is worse than killing them; yea, such a sin As hath by Infidels abhorred bin. Where's nothing left, there nothing can be got; And, to oppress, because men have it not, Is an inhumane, and a brutish evil, That's found in none, but an incarnate Devil. Sir, by profession, you a Christian are, And, I hope, this mind, is from you so far, That you all civil usages will daign, So long as in your keeping I remain. A Cat no more can yeeld you, but her skin. If Sheep do pay the Fleeces they are in, They'l grow again, so you from Curs preserve them, And shut them not so close up, that you starve them. That which concerneth other men, and me, This day, another day your case may be: For, Changes are not fixt with such a Pin, But, that those things may happen, which have bin. Consider it: If Mercy you extend, 'Twill make a better man than I your Friend; And much more honour you, than all your pow'r, As Alderman, Lieutenant of the Towre, And Member of the Commons, if severe You prove to me, beyond what I can bear: For, if through want, I perish in these bands, My Blood will be required at your hands; And, you will find, that I am own'd by Him, Who justifieth, when man doth condemn. Do as your heart inclines: If you deny me Things needful, GOD himself will then supply me With strength to bear it, till I shall enjoy That Freedom, which no mortal can destroy: And when the World hath done the worst she can, Good men will say, I was an honest man, To GOD, Prince, Conscience, and my Country true, What-ever, on my Tryal, shall ensue; Yea, though with rigor I may suffer all That's threatned, and seems likely to befall, I do not yet perceive, which way GOD can Be honour'd more by any mortal man, Than by the Joy and Courage he may give him, When others think they most extreamly grieve him. If I had suffred less since I begun To serve Him; I his Work could not have done; And, what I now shall suffer, may add more Unto his Honour, than all heretofore. And, from that, whereto Conscience doth invite, My Punishment, will not one man affright Who owns my Principles; and shall have grace To act them soberly, in his own place. Sir, I have twenty times as much to say, But, here I am compelled to make stay: For lo, this Trencher will contain no more, And, Paper must not come within my door. Your Prisoner, Geo. Wither. Hearing it reported, that the Diurnal women cryed the news of his Impeachment for Treason, he composed this Epigram. I am preferr'd from Newgate to the Tow'r; And, as the Summers heat mends Ale that's sowr, So, here my state is mended; and what follows, May be, for ought I yet perceive, the Gallows. Hark! what is that which now the woman cryes, Who, this day selleth weekly Truths and Lyes? How! an Impeachment against Major Wither? These words, methinks, seem not well put together. But, let them passe, until I know the reason; Perhaps, a kind of whisteling of Treason I am thought guilty of: and if some say The Fox's ears are horns, who help it may? These Novels, only please, or else affright, Children &amp; Fools, who know not black from white, Nor right from wrong; and quite contrary things They'l tel next week, to what this week forth brings. However, Friends, be not thereof afeard, He that shall stand accused, must be clear'd Or else condemn'd, before that any one Can justly say, that right or wrong is done. The Commons do intend to vindicate Their Honour; and I am not griev'd thereat, For, it concerns them; and the Reputation Of their House is the Honour of the Nation. If that which I have writ, seditious be, Or scandalous, 'twas not so made by me: But, rather, by some Members of their own; For, to all other men, it is unknown; And was by me, compos'd with an intent, Both Scandal and Sedition to prevent, As that Remonstrance truly hath averd, Which to their Speaker I long since preferd. I did but part of that in private write, Which genrally was fam'd, that make I might Good use thereof: And, if that be a crime, I know it was not so in former time, Nor will be so hereafter, unless we To universal Ruine destin'd be. If their Proceed against me be severe, The more my Innocency will appear To prudent men; And, if I wronged be, The more GOD will be merciful to me. He that beneath his Wings hath his abidings, Needs not to be afraid of evil tidings, Though they cry'd, Fire &amp; Brimstone is descending; For, Angels alwayes are on him attending. If they, as consciencious be, as wise, Upon whom now an Imposition lies To charge me; They, perhaps, when they have weigh'd What I have done, with what I've writ and said In my defence; will to that sense incline, Whereby the Honour of their House, and mine, May joyntly be preserv'd, and make good use Of that which hath been deemed an abuse. I know discreet men cannot be so mad, To make that worse, which is already bad, Or, not to leave one single person free To speak Truth plainly, when just cause may be. For, they so understand, what doth belong To Free-men, and to Slaves, to right and wrong; That, to excuse the breach of any Laws, I shall not need a Favour worth two straws, If Justice may take place, (as I conceive It will, when they my Innocence perceive.) Yea, peradventure, they, who yet seem Foes, Will be to me so friendly in the close, That they will by their Justice, honour gain, And, me into their favour entertain. One bitter herb spoils not a pot of Broth, (Though some the single tast thereof may loath) But, makes the same perhaps much wholsomer Than if it totally omitted were. The best among us, at the best are sinners, And, in true Penitence, but new beginners, Who need forgiveness: and, GOD will bestow Such Mercy, as to other men we show. 'Tis not the cutting-off of one mans ears Will stop the Voice which ev'ry body hears; Nor possible, if Tongue and Life they take From me, to make all men afraid to speak: Nor is't in Whirlwinds, which the Rocks do rend, Whereby GOD will into mens hearts descend. Sunshine makes us those Robes aside to lay, Which furious Tempests cannot tear away: And, they whom Threatnings cannot work upon, By Gentleness and Kindness may be won To yeeld up their own Judgments, and their Will, Sometime for good, and otherwhile for ill. GOD by his Grace, preserve me from that snare, And then, come what come will, I nothing fear. For, chiefest causes of the greatest Evils, Are these; kind Foes, good Witches, and white Devils. Ingenii Largitor Venter. Hunger will break Stonewalls, and make Fools witty; When others will not, we our selves must pitty: For, he that wholly doth himself neglect, Cannot his Neighbour heartily affect. And, if we love not those whom we have seen, The Love of GOD in us hath not yet been. By what Expedient, I shall henceforth get A means to vent my thoughts, I know not yet. My Black-lead's took away; and worn out quite My Oker-pensil is; therefore Good-night. All I can now do, is to sit and think, What might be writ with Paper, Pen and Ink. GEO. WITHER, Close-Prisoner. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THIRD COLLECTION THE TWO INCOMPARABLE GENERALISSIMO'S of the world, with their Armies briefly described and embattailed, visibly and invisibly opposing each other. The one is the old Serpent the Devill, Generall of the Church Malignant. The other is the Lord Jesus Christ, Generall of the Church Militant. Argument. According to the Enmity decreed Betweene the womans and the Serpents seed In Paradise, each other doth defie, This hatred lasteth to Eternity: No marvell then that Warre is now begun Unnaturally 'twixt father and the son. Clad all in angry Armes of discontent, Because of his perpetuall banishment From blisse, above five thousand yeares ago, And in revenge of that same fatall blow, Given him by that pure unspotted Child, Borne of a woman whom he so beguild, The old infernall Serpent ever since, Hath prov'd a hatefull Rebell to his Prince, And all enrag'd with malice and despight, He leads his captive souldiers thus to fight. In Van, or Front march Infidels without The Church, then Persecutors, and the rout Of Heretiques within; the Middleward Prophane, and all ungodly men do guard; The Reare consists of an accursed Crew, Terrible indeed, and hideous to view (As Conscience awaked once can tell) Deadly sinne, damnation, death and hell. The wings, or sides this body that inclose Are fleshly lusts, and worldly pleasures Foes, That by force of strong perswasion kill, Moe, than the Tempter can with all his skill. The Collonels, Captains, Drums and Trumpeters, And other such inferiour Officers, Are infernall spirits hovering in the aire; Th'word of command's Presumption and Despaire. Thus Summum Malum, Summum Bonums Foe, Sets up his Standard here on earth below; And with his false suggestions, every houre Drawes to his party a Malignant power Of Potentates, as well as baser sort, His earthly fading kingdomes to support, And sends abroad his nimble Mercuries, Intelligencers, Scouts, and Aulick lyes, And promiseth rewards for all their paines, As pleasures, treasures, dignities and gaines: But all these proffers prove but a flim-flam, He leaves them at the last like Doctor Lambe; And when delights, and life are gone and past, Then comes the sad Catastrophe at last, Endlesse and easelesse torments in hell-fire, This is the Serpents and his souldiers hire. Against this Hydra-headed Army stands The Prince of Peace, with his victorious bands; Not that this glorious Conquerour doth need Created helpe, t'effect a noble deed; For He Himselfe did long ago subdue The Prince of darknesse, and th'infernall crew; But to communicate He doth delight To silly Mortals His owne matchlesse might, Which so upon them daily He conferres, That in the end th'are more than conquerers; Yet none but slaves, and conquered by sinne He makes His souldiers, and the field to winne, After He first hath pull'd them from the jawes Of death and hell, and given them new Lawes And principles divine; then doth dispose Them thus in order 'gainst His Churches Foes. The Vant-guard doth consist of Saints, and brave Heroick Martyrs, who despise the grave; The true Professours of the Gospell next, (With scoffing Chams and lying Doegs vext) March in the Middleward; But O the Reare, (That which most th'infernall force doth feare) Consisteth of the Generalls owne merits, Which succour sends unto the fainting spirits Of all His souldiers, who else would be lost; The wings on each side of this glorious Hoast, Are stretched farre above all earthly things, Spirituall graces making lively springs Of hope and joy with promises so sure Of heav'nly life for ever to endure. The Officers to this High Generall, Are brave Commanders, blessed Angels all, Who at their Captaines becke like lightning move; Th'word of command is this; I feare, and love. Thus stands the Christian arm'd against his Foes, Giving, and sometimes taking many blowes, And that not by imaginary force But as really as did Foot and Horse Neare Winchester of late, where soules apace Fled to the frowning and the smiling face Of this great Generall; For only He Bindeth, and maketh men and Angels free. And by His mighty power doth so keepe His souldiers happy soules that fall asleepe That stinging death shall never hurt them, why? Because they dye to live eternally. To the Reader. Now may thine eye convey unto thy heart, Thine own condition (Reader) on whose part Or side, to take up armes thou dost intend, Or be unto thy selfe a Foe or Friend; For under one of these two Generalls The service of all men and Angels falls; You see the Captaines and their wages both, O love the one then, and the other loath. G. W. The dark Lantern, Containing A dim Discoverie, in Riddles, Parables, and Semi-Riddles, intermixt with Cautions, Remembrances and Predictions, as they were promiscuously and immethodically represented to their Author, in his Solitary Musings, the third of November 1652. about Midnight. Whereunto is annexed, A POEM, Concerning A Perpetuall Parliament. By Geo. Wither Esquire. TO THE PARLIAMENT, AND PEOPLE OF THE Commonwealth of England. So let me speed, in all that I pursue, As, in what followes, I mean well to you: And, as I bear a loving faithfull heart, To all of you, united and apart; Although, I peradventure, may appear On some occasions, bitterly severe, To those, in whom, I private-failings see, Which, to the Publike may obnoxious be; To make them judge themselves, and scape the doom, Which, from another judgement, els may come: For, at no single person, have I strook, By any line, or passage, in this book. If here, I further seem to have presum'd, Or, more upon my self to have assum'd, Then may be warrantable thought, at first, Examine it, before you judge the worst; And, try by circumstances (as ye may) What Spirit, hath directed me this way; Or, for what likely ends, or for whose sake, I could, or dared, this attempt to make; Except it were for GODS, for your, and mine, As they with one another, do intwine. Yea, search, if my Religion, studies, wayes, Or, manners (which have beene throughout my dayes, Before your eyes) may any sign afford, That, I have, hitherto, in deed, or word, Been an Impostor; or, presented you With ought, that hath been uselesse, or untrue; And as that justly may incline your mind, Let these expressions acceptation find. If madnesse, they appear; consider well, That, such miscensurings have often fell On sober men, when those deluding crimes, Were prevalent, which raign in these our times. If foolish, they be thought; remember this, That, truest wisdome, seemeth foolishnesse To worldly prudent men, when, God, forth brings To fool their wisdome, despicable things. Men, hear fools gladly, when themselves are wise, And, meekly pity, rather then despise Their folly; learning, thereby, sometimes too, More, then by their own wisdome, they could do: But, wise, mad, foolish, or, what ev'r I am, To do this work, into the world I came; To these times, was reserv'd; to this end, taught; And, to the sight of many things, am brought, Which, els I had not known, nor would have seen, But, that, I ty'd, (as by the leg) have been, (Ten years together, ten dayes work to do) To know them, whether I so would or no. And, when I knew them, I would fain have done My own work first, or els, like Jonas run To Tarsis, or Lundee, or any whither (Adventuring through Seas, and Tempests thither) Much rather, then to have proceeded on, In doing that, which I, at last, have done. For, I am like the world, in many things, And, oft so tempted by her promisings Of ease and safety, in another course, That, I, with much strife, did my heart inforce, To prosecute her duty; as ye may, Perceive, if, you the following tract survay. But, my own thoughts, would neither let me sleep, Nor suffer me a waking-peace to keep, Or, follow my affairs (though they were brought Neer to a point, of coming quite to nought) Till, I, my musings, had in words array'd To be, by you, and other men, survay'd. All those affairs, aside, I, therefore threw, To cloth my meditations, for your view; Which, being finish'd, I can now lye down And sleep, as well as any man in Town. The times are dangerous; and, I am told, By that which is my Guide, I should not bold Beyond discretion be; which makes me talk In riddles, and with this Dark Lantern walk: That, I may see my way, and not be seen By ev'ry one, whom I may meet, between My goings out, and in: and that it may Give light to some, who are beside their way, As I occasion find; and, where I see The light that's offer'd, may accepted be. But, what my visions are, as in relation, Unto this Parliaments perpetuation I plainly shall unfold; because, it may Concern you all, with good advise to weigh. Yea, fearlefly, my free thoughts, I will shew, What liking, or dislike, soe're ensue. For, though to all intents by me design'd, They may not reach; it much contents my mind, That I have freed my soul, by thus imploying My Talent, to an inward rests injoying; And, rais'd a Witnesse up, that may declare To future times; what GOD'S proceedings are. If this find acceptation, it will be A sign of future peace, to you, and me. If, you reject it; I will fit my mind To bear the troubles, which are yet behind: Bewail, our manifold procrastinations, Of GOD'S intended blessings, to these Nations. Possesse the little portion, I have got As lost, or, els, as if I had it not; And, strive to wean my heart, from things abroad, To seek my rest, and peace, alone in GOD: A refuge, so secur'd to me, that, neither My frailties, faults, or foes; or these together: Or friends, or Trustees failings, either may Hazard, or forfeit; tear, or fool away. Your most humble, and most faithfull Remembrancer, Geo. Wither. A DARK-LANTERNE, OFFERING A Dim Discovery, in Riddles, Parables, and Semi-riddles, intermixt with Cautions, Remembrances, and Predictions, as they were promiscuously, and immethodically represented to their Author, in his solitary musings, the third of November 1652. about midnight. And, concluding with the Result of a Contemplative Vision, revealing a probable means of making, even this present Parliament, to be both perpetuall, and acceptable to these Nations to the end of the World. He, that goes with this LIGHT, his way may find: Him, that against it comes, it maketh blind. He, from whose perfect Light, all true Lights come, Spake Parables; yea, spake nought els, to some; And, Providence, by many various wayes, Of dispensation, to the world convayes The means, of carrying on, those works which tend To man's perfection, at his later end; And, to the wonderfull accomplishment, Of what, eternally is his intent; Bringing oft times about, the self-same things, (Or, such like) towards their accomplishings; That, prudent men, might understand thereby What he designs, and therewithall comply. When Jacobs Off-springs (who, for many ages Were figures, types, examples, and presages For future times, and states) became perverted, And, grew to be so blind, and stubborn hearted, As to despise the warnings, precepts, cautions, And good advise, which for their preservations Their Prophets had perspicuously declar'd; GOD, justly, sent unto them afterward, His mind in Parables, whereof but few The meanings, or interpretations knew: And as they more and more, from him declin'd, (And, from the truth) the more he couch'd his mind In dark expressions, till they nothing saw But what their pleasure made to be a Law. Prince, Prophet, Priest, and People, then, became Wholly corrupt; a scandall, and a shame To their Professions, and to all their Nation, By an unlimited prevarication; Whereby, the means ordained to recure them, Was rendred instrumentall to obdure them, By their own fault, and those hypocrisies, Which, justly, drew a vail, before their eyes. For, whereas, usually in times preceding, GODS errands, were made plain, at their first heeding, So, also, were their Priests, and Prophets, then, Renowned, wise, and honorable men, Ev'n in their outward being; which, did add Repute to that, which in command, they had: But, Heardsmen, and fruit-gatherers, afterward (With such as brought no motives of regard, According to the flesh) were sometime sent; Which, in their hearers, did but scorn augment. And, thus, contempt increas'd: the truths then told, Were not alone, wrapt up in manifold Strange ambiguities, obscure expressions, Dark Metaphors, or much beclouded Visions, Which few could understand; but, some, likewise Illustrated their words, and Prophecies, (Or, rather vailed them) with circumstances, Which, did inlarge their hearers ignorances; As also their disdains: for, otherwhile, They personated things, absurd, and vile, In vulgar apprehension: such as seem Deserving rather slighting, then esteem; Yea such, sometimes, as wicked did appear To those, who morally men righteous were: As when, they were made signes, unto that Nation, Of their shame, nakednesse, or desolation, And of GODS lasting love, although they had, By their adulteries, him jealous made. As with the Jewes, he, formerly hath done, GOD will proceed with us; and hath begun Already, so to judge (and visit here) As he did them, when they rebellious were. He, so, by changes, moves us to repent; And, judgements blends with mercies, to th'intent That, he, into capacity might wooe us Of that great good, which he desires to do us. This, makes him, sometime smile, and sometime frown; Now, raise us up; to morrow, pull us down: This day, he, to our strongest enemies, Renders us dreadfull: They, whom we despise That night triumph; and make us glad to fly Into our chambers, and there sneaking lie; Whil'st they deride, insult, affront and jeer us, Who, some few hours before, did greatly fear us. This, makes him often fool our wisdome so, That, we are at a non-plus, what to do; And, then, in our distresse, to make our want, Weaknesse, and failings, more predominant For our deliverance, in a fatall hour, Then all our wealth, our wisdome, and our power. This, makes him lead us through the wildernesses Of doubts, dispairings, troubles, and distresses To our desired Canaan, as he led His Chosen heretofore; and, as he did To them in their respective aberrations, So hath he done, and will do, with these Nations. As their, right so, our Princes, for oppressions Are driven from their Thrones, and their possessions, To eat (ev'n with confusion of their faces) Their bread with scarcity, in uncouth places; Where, peradventure, they were mindfull made Of those forewarnings, which they timely had. Our Lords (as their Remembrancer, foretold, When they had greatest likelyhood to hold, And to encrease their greatnesse) this day, see, Their House of Parliament, destroy'd to be, Ev'n by it self; and, that they are become Vagrants abroad, or, els despis'd at home. Some of their Pallaces and Piles of State, Are ras't, defac't, or left quite desolate, For Zim, and Jim; for Vermine and such fowls, As Dawes, and Ravens; great and little Owls. Our Priests, that were the glorioust Hirarchy, And proud'st in Europe, next the Papacy; (Who, by the same pen warned, did return Sharp persecutions, injuries and scorn) Are now despoil'd of all the pomp they had, Dishonor'd, poor, and despicable made. Their fair Cathedrall Temples stand forsaken, With still increasing ruines, rent and shaken; And, in their steeds, those persons are deputed, Whom they most hated, and most persecuted. The Threats long since pronounced, now prevail, The Priest and Prophet, are become the tail; And meer Mechanicks made dispensers are Of those things, which to them committed were: Persons, of so mean guifts, and small respect, That, truth out of their mouths, gets but neglect; Except with such, as nndervalue not Good wine, though offered in an earthen pot. For our unthankfulnesse, and disregard Of nobler Teachers, whom, we long have heard, Without improvement; for, hypocrisies, Meer outside worship, and formalities, In prayers, fasts, and praises; and, for, giving That which cost nothing, for great boons receiving: For our backslidings, and, then, persevering In frequent sinning, after frequent bearing: For actions, not agreeing with our saying: For painting, guilding, and for overlaying Our Carnall structures, with fain'd piety: (False gold, producted by our Chymestry) For falsifying, with a brazen brow, The serious promises, which we did vow To GOD and men, before the face of heaven, When we into extremities were driven: For adding to devouring flames, more fuell: For being, in our very mercies, cruell: For turning carelesly, our eyes, and ears, From Widdows prayers, and from Orphans tears: Yea, though Remembrancers did (as it were) In publike, often pull us by the ear, To mind it; yea, where many standers by, Observ'd it; and, our grosse stupidity. For these things; and, for many such as these God, having spoken to us, in our dayes, By ordinary Preachers; now, begins By others, to reprove us for our sins: Not only such, as reason may allow, Though called from the Shop board, or the Plough; But, such, as we seem justly to contemn, As making truths adhor'd, which come from them. In steed of Teachers, train'd up in the Schools Of Arts, and of the Prophets; children, fools, Women and madmen, we do often meet, Preaching, and threatning Judgements, in the street: To some, pronouncing blessings; to some, woe; Scatt'ring their bread, and money, as they goe, To such as need; (though, in appearance, none Can poorer be, then they, when that is gone:) Yea, by strange actions, postures, tones, and cryes, Themselves they offer to our ears and eyes, As signs unto this Nation, of some things Thereby portended; which (although this brings Contempt upon their persons) may be so, For ought, the wisest of us, yet doth know; As were those actions, personated by Some Prophets, whom the Jewes did vilifie. It may be on that darknesse, which they find, Within their hearts, a suddain light hath shin'd, Reflexions making, of some things to come, Which leave within them, musings troublesome To their weak spirits; or, too intricate For them to put in order, and relate; As they will easily believe, on whom, Such, more then naturall, out-beamings, come) And, that, hath peradventure, thrust them on To act, as men in extasies have done; Striving, their Cloudy Visions to declare (And, of what consequence, they think they are) Till they have lost the Notions, which they had, And, want but few degrees, of being mad. This, Providence permitteth, to correct Our deafnesse, and our former disrespect Of nobler instruments, whose lights did shine More clearly; and, who, laying line, to line; Precept, to Precept; in and out of season, Taught reasonably, ev'n truth's, transcending reason: Or, els, it hath permitted been, to make us Lesse heedfull, of the plague, that may or'etake us; By tokens, and by symptoms, to us giving, That, seem not worth our heeding, or believing. And, I, perhaps, among these, may be one, That was let loose, for service to be done. In order to such kinds: (as, I believe I am; as when I am gone, some will perceive, Though, none observe it now) For, though I dresse The mind, and matter, of my messages, In measur'd words, with some such other fancies, As are allowed in Poetick frenzies, And, passe for sober garbs: yet, now and then, I blunder out, what worldly prudent men Count madnesse; and, what, oft, the best men, too, Dislike awhile, and wish me not to do. But, I best know my warrant; and proceed As I am mov'd, with little fear, or heed, What others judge: for, till some slips, or errors Expose me, to be liable to terrors, Ther's nothing, to my hurt, can dreadfull be, Save my own flesh, and he that gave it me. And, as this makes me, madly seem to dare; Ev'n so, that seeming madnesse, doth prepare, And draw some, out of novelty, to heed, What, they had never, els, vouchsaf'd to read: And, these my ridlings now, are an invention Designed partly, unto that intention; And, partly likewise, to amaze those Readers, Who, to my purposes, are counter-pleaders. When, others think, the times afford me may Enough to speak of, I have nought to say: When my heart calls upon me, I cast by My own affairs, and to that call apply, As I occasions find, uttring sometimes, My thoughts in prose, another while in rimes; One while, by sharp, and bitter strains reproving; Sometimes, by admonitions, calm, and loving; Yea, Jigs of recreation, sometimes fidling; And, now, I'm faln into a fit of Ridling. Riddle my Riddles, then, you, that have heard Truths, oft, and plainly spoke without regard, (Except it were in mischiefs, to combine Against their peace, who cast their Pearles to swine) Riddle them if you can: For, in them lies, A dim character of our destinies. Within these Problemes, those things couched are, Which I once thought, more plainly to declare: But, from that purpose, have now chang'd my mind, That, seeing, you might see, yet still be blind: That, you might read, and yet not understand The work, which GOD and men, have now in hand: Or, which of those things will be first, or last, Lest, future fates appear by what is past: And, that, your misinterpretations may Produce those good effects, which you delay: For, to that purpose, all, which I unfold, Histerologically shall be told. You, likewise, who oft read, in serious wise, Shiptons Predicts, and Merlins Prophecies; Or, vain conjectures, from the constellations, Wherewith, Impostors, have long fool'd these Nations, Neglecting that, the while, which both foreseen, And, brought to passe, in your own dayes, hath been: Riddle these Riddles; or, at least peruse them, And, if you find them frivolous, refuse them. Riddle these Riddles too, ev'n you, that seek The common peace, with hearts upright and meek: You, that have understanding to discern The present times; and, willing are to learn Good lessons from a Pismire: For, to you, By this Dark Lantern, I shall give a view, Of things far off, and rubs now in your way, Whereat, through want of light, you stumble may: And, likewise, of effects, whereto, perchance, You, by these glimmerings, may raise advance. Observe them well, without enquiring, what Their Authors meaning was, in this, or that, Till, you your selves, have search'd, how they in reason, Suit our affairs, our persons, and the season, According to your judgements: for, that, shall Be somewhat to the purpose, though not all. But, where no sense that's likely, you can rear, Leave it, as that, which lies without your sphear; For, that, which SHALL BE, will receive a being, From each dissenting Readers disagreeing; From that mans knowledge, who the sense hath got; From that mans ignorance, who knowes it not; And he that would, and he that would not too, Shall help effect, what GOD intends to do. Thus, through a long lane, I have drawn you in, Where my new Grove of Riddles doth begin, With, now and then, a plain Lawn intermixt, And, here and there, a small sherewood betwixt; With such digressions, that, you'l sometimes doubt, Whether I lead you, further in, or out: But, 'tis a wild plot, where are walks, and bowers, Made for my own content, as well as yours: And, if they tedious seem, you may be gone At next low gap, you see, and no harm done. The harvest of our Æra now drawes near, And, faithfull Labourers will then appear To order that fair field, wherein was sown The Corn, which now with tares is overgrown: And, to distinguish Wheat, from that which had Resemblance of it, both in stalk, and blade. Yet, ev'ry day, Impostors creeping in, Will, by pretended holinesse, begin To plant themselves; seeking their lusts to feed, By scattering adulterated-seed; And lab'ring, to destroy those means, whereby Truth may appear in perfect purity. In little time, shall many changes be, And interchanges, which will make men see Their wisdome to be folly; their chief might, Flat feeblenesse; their high esteemed light Meer darknesse; and, that, most things by them done, Will have effects, which they nev'r thought upon. In that Catholicon, or Mithridate, Which Providence, confected hath of late, To temper, or dispell, what hath diseas'd The Body Politike; it hath been pleas'd (As finding it, a mixture requisite) Vipers, and mortall poysons, to unite With wholesome things; yea, mineralls and mettle, Sulphur, and Steel, fixt matter, to unsettle: The Serpents brains, with faithfull Turtles hearts: Of Lions, Lambs, and Foxes, some choice parts: Somewhat of Hares, that swift and fearful be: Somewhat of Snailes, in whom we nothing see, But slownesse, and, by well compounding these, A cure preparing is, for our disease. Fire, Water, Earth, and Ayr, (though disagreeing, In qualities) if well mixt, give a being To that, which cannot be, by any one Or, any two, or three of these alone: And, so, at last, shall ev'ry contradiction, Among us, add some Dos, to our perfection: Yea, they who pull down, and they who erect Shall in the close, concur in one effect; That, he, who's all in all, may have due praise By ev'ry contradiction in our wayes; And, that, out of their discords, he may bring A Diapason, making ev'ry thing Assent together, in the consummation Of his designment, at the worlds creation. For, whil'st this medicine fermenting lies, The wheels of temp'rall contrarieties Move on; and, ev'ry day, abroad will send Productions, few, discerning to what end: And, yet, each individuall circumstance, Somewhat, the Grand-designment, shall advance. Yea, foolings, failings, fraud, and treachery As well as truth, and true sincerity, Shall add thereto; and, herein, will alone, The diff'rence be; such, as have justly done Their duties; and, in doing them persever, (Or, willingly, and knowingly endeavour As they are able) will enjoy the blisse, Which, they who counter-operate shall misse. I. G. N. R. N. S. with, other some, Such like, confederated are become, To ruine this Republike; and, have laid Designes, whereby it may be soon betray'd, And, infamous, insensibly, become, With all wise men abroad, and here at home. These (though but few observe it) have, long, had A purpose these three Ilands to invade; And, to possesse them, with a people far More barbarous then Kernes, and Redshanks are. Some of their Party, to promote their ends, Do yet appear to be our faithfull friends; And, into every place of Power, and Trust, Themselves, and their confederates have thrust. In Townes and Boroughs, Cittadells and Cities, In Courts, and Councells, and in all Committees; In offices of profit, and command, Throughout the Commonwealth, at Sea, and Land They have Abettors; and, so bold they grow That, every man almost, their aimes may know; And, their attempts, although but fools they are Are at this present time, improv'd fo far That, they have shaken that, wherein consists, Our honor, and our noblest interests; And into practise, they begin to draw Among us here, the Clagefurtian Law. M. N. O. P. Demas, Diotrophes, Peripateticks, Stoicks, Pharisees, With others, who, in judgement diff'ring be, Will, altogether, as one man agree, To fortifie their private interest, Indangering (by what shall be possest Unduly) that, which is to others due: Untill the faithfull Shepherds do pursue Their claim aright; the same deriving from Their Foster-Fathers, whence, it first did come; And, of whom, it was long since propheci'd That, GOD, by them, a portion would provide For those, he sends forth, to preserve the beauty Of holinesse, when, man, forgets his duty. Some other accidents, time will beget Which may be mark'd out, by our Alphabet: By, and for envy, jealousie, and pride, Shall, A. B. C. be laid awhile, aside. Despised also, V. and I. shall be P P. and S. against C S. and P. Shall then conspire; and, for a Salve employ That, which it self, and all things, doth destroy, If Alpha and Omega, help not more Then all the other letters, did before: For, common helps, will be apply'd in vain, The fury of their madnesse, to restrain. The causes, whence this hazard will arise, Are such as this; observe it, and be wise. The Temple of the Gods, which heretofore Stood open to the prayers of the poor, Is closed up, and few admitted in, But, such as are conveyed by a gin, Contriv'd so narrow, that the people say It was choak'd up, the first, or second day: And, with distemper, they exclaim, that this Of all their grievances, the greatest is: Because it puts their patience, to more trialls, Then, if of Justice, they had quick denialls: Turnes hopes into despairs; converts their lives To living deaths, their balmes to corosives. The Saints likewise, that must propitiate, On their behalfs, and offer at the gate Of justice and of mercy, their petitions Are not so sensible of their conditions; Nor from all partiality so free As Mediators alwayes ought to be. This, makes one grumble in his privacies; Another, gapes out open blasphemies: Some, with such indignation filled are, As, if they Giant-like, would make a warre Against their GODS (if, lookers on, may guesse, By their distempers, of their purposes) And, universally, there is a cry So lamentable, and rais'd up so high, That, if these Deities, shall not in time, With due compassion, bow their ears to them, And, their just Prayers, and requests fulfill, A higher power, these plaints examine will, And these inferiour Gods, shall tumble then, From heav'n like Lucifer, and die like men. Riddle this Riddle, and resolve me whether This Temple, be Pantheon, or some other, Wherein Subdeities, invoked are: What Temple e're it be; we wish it were More open; lest upon those Gods, it bring Contempt, or worse, and ruines ev'ry thing To them subordinate: for, hence doth flow Most other grievances, complain'd of now; And, hence rise those confusions, which increase Our troubles, and procrastinate our peace. From hence is it, mens suits prolonged are Beyond their lives; and after twice five year, As far from ending, as when they begun; Yea, endlesse, till poor Suiters are undone, At these words, an Illusion cry,d, take heed; And, further do not in this strain proceed; Lest, some Interpreters, interpret, so, Thy Riddles, that the Ridler they undo. The suddain caution, startled me a while; Yet, back return'd it with a strong recoil; Suggesting, that I over-much bewray'd Their nakednesse; and them too open laid Whose shame I ought to hide, and, that so far It may provoke them, who soon angry are, As thereby to indanger at the least, My quiet, and my private interest. How, therefore, this objection I past over, E're further I proceed, I'le here discover. Against these doubts, my Genius up arose, And, quite out of my heart, their poyson throws; Assuring me, I had no cause to fear What other mens interpretations were; Or, to suppose the safety of this Nation Were not more worthy of a preservation Then their repute, who are quite senslesse growne, Both of the publike danger, and their owne. Or think it better that a generall Disease o'respread us, rather, then to call A Scab, a Scab, or, timely to declare The cure of these things, which destructive are. It told me, (and with arguments not weak) The cause, and time, requir'd me now to speak Without respect of persons; and, that, I Was bound unto it by my fealty. It told me, 'twas a duty whereunto I was ordain'd; and, which I'm kept to do. It represents unto me, from what strong And spitefull Adversaries; and, how long, I have preserved been, since I begun To do such works, when they were to be done. It bids me to record, by what strange wayes, (And means unlikely) I have all my dayes, Deliverances obtain'd; ev'n when I had, Oppressions, that might make a wise man mad; And, not one friend, me, in those streights to own, But, such as GOD still rais'd me up unknown. It bids me mind, how oft (when I have had No other help) his Providence hath made The malice of my foes, things to project Against me which my succour, did effect; And, without which, I probably had lost Just expectations, with much pain and cost. It bids me mark, how many there are still, (Who, without cause, have born me evill will) That daily do expect to see me stumble, When they may add a kick, to make me tumble: How, in those High Assemblies, where they deem, It may most disadvantage my esteem, They whisper out detractions; or, speak loud Those things, which cannot justly be avow'd: How enviously, they often make relations Of what GOD gives, beyond their expectations; With such periphrases, as may infer That, my supplies, were got as ill as their. It wills me, likewise, seriously to heed, How, they in other things, with me proceed; How, by their spight, all publike favours done me. Bring nought, as yet, but cost, and troubles on me, Which had e're this destroy'd me, had I not Preventions, from a Power above them got: And, by these mercies, it conjures me to What, conscience, and my judgement, bids me do. It minds me to be mindfull of that powre, Which hath preserv'd in every evill hour. How plentifully, I have still been fed, Ev'n when I saw not means, of next dayes bread But, what was in their hands, who would not spare, The least supply, when most distrest we were. How, my repute, with good men, was maintain'd, When with unjust aspersions, I was stain'd: And, when our Princes, on their Judgement Seats, Thundred against me, nothing lesse then threats. It charmes, to observe, that, though I get Little or nothing, of that publike debt Which was assign'd, and which hath now been due Ten years (by claimes approved just and true, On treble trialls) and, though ever since, It yeelds me nought, but troubles and expence; That GOD, hath naythelesse, improv'd of late, My Mite, into a competent estate; Meerly, by such unlikely means, as those Which Jacob us'd, when in the watering troughs, He laid his whitled sticks, till he was paid The wages, which his Master had delaid. It calleth on me, to look back upon Those works, which have within my dayes been done; (And chiefly those, which stand in some relation Unto my self, together with this Nation) What strange effects, and unbelieved things, Have followed my fore conjecturings: What risings, and what fallings, I have heeded: What mercies, and what judgements have succeeded Our various paths. It urgeth me to weigh, What may bety'd me, if I disobey The motions of my heart, and what event He may expect, who shall be negligent To do his duty, when his eye perceives What GOD intends; and, when his heart believes, He dreams not; but, is really required To act, according, as he is inspired: And, somewhat tells me, that, if after all These mercies, and remembrances, I fall From my resolves; GOD justly may expose, And leave me, to the malice of my foes. Lest, yet, my frailties, or self interest, Or carnall reasons, somewhat might suggest To blow all this away; it, comes sometimes, At midnight (as it did of late) and chimes Dreadfull Alarms, which, do awaking keep Mine eyes, when other men are fast asleep: From darknesse, then, it fresh advantage taking, (And from vain thoughts, which too oft keep me waking) Thus, it invades me; what is that, which thou Li'st muzing on, and ruminating now? Art thou contriving, how to lay foundations For thine own family, when Kings, and Nations, Are tumbling down? and, when impartiall fates, Are overthrowing Monarchies, and States? Is this a time to settle, when there are Earthquakes, that shake the mountains, ev'ry where? Is this a time to plant, when thunder-strokes, Root up high Cedars, and break down strong Okes? Is this a time to purchase, when the trouble, And hazards, make the payments more then double? Or wheel thee (as by triall thou hast found) Into a fruitless and a tedious round? But, if a seasonable time, it be For others, can it so befall to thee, Whil'st thou delayest his affairs, from whom, The means to make thy purchases, must come? When, GOD, to build thy house, hath now begun, Wil't then, to finish it to others run? As if, he, who from nothing, heretofore Thus far, hath brought thee, now, could do no more? Oh take good heed, what course, thou dost pursue, (And, what neglect) lest els, thy course, thou rue. God, hath already, made thee to possesse The gates of those that were thine enemies: And by a means unlooked for, restor'd That, which was taken from thee by the Sword: Houses, by others built, to thee are granted, Orchards and Gardens, which thou hast not planted, He gives, in recompense for what was lost In publike service; yea, without the cost Of this Republike; and, had more bestowne E're now, perhaps, if thou to do thine owne Had'st not delay'd his work, and, to thy hope For this (it may be) he will put a stop. Why, then, with fruitlesse musings, busied are Thy thoughts, on what, must be anothers care? Deferring that, which thou art call'd unto, And seeking daily, somewhat els to do? Art thou afraid, lest thou thereby may'st lose Thy late recruits? or, reinrage thy foes? Or, marr thy quiet? cursed is that fear; And, thou too, if therein thou persevere: For, when a temp'rall blessing, makes us worse, It is a plague, beyond a tem'prall curse And, if thou take not heed will quite deprive thee Of that which Providence, did freely give thee. But, who are they? or, where inhabit those Who dare to take away, what, GOD, bestowes If thou adhere to him? whom need'st thou fear, If in thy duty, thou shalt persevere? Nay, rather, which of those, that seem to be Most dreadfull, shall not be afraid of thee If he be guilty? and, who (though on high He bears his head) shall not, in privacy, Think on thy lines, with trembling, when he hears What they declare, and what his conscience fears? If thou, said my good Angell, hast not, yet, Quite shaken off, thy fears, and fanting fit; Consider, wisely, of this Generation, In those things, which have thereto, nigh relation: Sum up together, that, which thou hast heeded In those thou fear'st: mark, how they have proceeded; What, they have been; what, at this time, they are; What, they may be, before they are aware; What, they design, in what paths they are going; What, they have done; what, they are daily doing; What Labyrinths involve them; what, confusions Enclose them round, as also what conclusions Are following; and, then, thou wilt not fear Their power as foes, nor for their friendship care. If, still, some outward interest, be that Which thou desir'st to save; consider, what Thereto conduceth: for, sometimes, the thing We fear to loose, is kept by hazarding: And, lost in seeking to preserve the same, By other means, then that, through which it came. If, thou, permit the proud, without a check To follow their career, they'l break, their neck. And, with themselves (as our affairs, now stand) Indanger all the people of this Land. Where, then, wilt thou be safe? or, where wilt thou Injoy with peace, what thou possessest now? But, if a word in season, thou shalt speak, Who knows, what instruments despis'd and weak May compasse? and, who knows, but that, of them, Who, heretofore thy cautions did contemn. Some, touch'd may be, with sense of their condition, And, turn back, from the path-wayes of Perdition? And, who knows not, that many may be found (Whose actions blamelesse are, whose faiths are sound) That, by these hints, may hart and courage take, Their Neighbours, from their dreamings, to awake? At least, therein thy duty having done, If any be secur'd, thou shalt be one. When these things were inspir'd, and duly weigh'd, My heart, which was a little while dismay'd From prosecuting, what I had begun, Assum'd new courage, and went boldly on: And, these expostulations, may perchance, Some others, to the like resolves advance On like occasions; unto which intent, These few short steps, beside my way I went: For I confesse, my theam I following not, Have rambled out, as if I had forgot What I at first proposed; and insteed Of Riddles, to plain language do proceed. But, I will wheel about, and with the rein Turn Pegasus, into his path again; Though, he, in his digressions (as we say Of Beggers) never is beside his way. Once on a time (thus did old tales begin, E're I was born, or thought I should have been) A foolish people, over much at ease, Their wantonnesse, and vanity to please, Among their may-games, brought home from the wood, Trees, which had els, till now, unheeded stood. Of these, they made, by hewings, knocks, and smoothing, That, look like something, which resembled nothing. And, out of knotty, shapelesse logs, did hew Some statues not uncomely to the view. These, e're quite shaped, with some jeers, and mocks, They set up higher, upon other blocks. Then, them repolished, and painted so, That, of what stuffe they were, few men could know. Beginning then, their own work, to admire, They rais'd them higher ev'ry day and higher, Till Idols they became; with whom, they grew At first, familiar, and did them bestrew With flowers and garlands: shortly after, they Bow'd humbly down before them, ev'ry day; Till custome, had their judgement more befool'd; But, then (when these, mishrin'd they did behold, Sparkling with Jewells, and with gold aray'd) They, of their own Creations, grew afraid. And, at the last, (as at the last, all do That whoring after their own fancies go;) These fools, repented of their superstition; Bewail'd the slavery, of their condition; With some appearances, of an intent To grow more wise, as well as to repent: Yea, to blaspheme, their new made GODS they spar'd not, And, would have pul'd them down again, but dar'd not. For, by their flattring attributes (long, given) They had advanc'd them, to a sphere, or heav'n, Where, uncontroul'd, a power they exercis'd According to their lust; and those despis'd Whose hands had made them, &amp; whose breath had blown them Too high, for their ambitiousnesse, to own them. Yea, by their incantations, these, had brought Strong spirits, into what their hands had wrought; Inliv'ning, and enabling them unto Those actions, which their makers might undo. Yet, persevere, this blockish people will To make such idols, and advance them still; Till both they, and their idols are destroy'd Unlesse the GOD of Gods, my fears makes void. For, most men being of a slavish mind, Are nat'rally to slavishnesse inclin'd: And to fulfill their bruitish lust will fawn Upon a Dog, and lay their souls to pawn. Riddle this Riddle, if you can, and tell What People, this may be, and where they dwell: Which I believing you with ease may do, Will add this following Parable thereto. There was a time, when silly Bees could speak, (A people, of much industry, though weak) And, these, among themselves, made grievous moans, As being much oppressed, by their drones; Who (having made intrusions among those That had an uncontroulable dispose Of their Republike) did in sundry wise, Incroachments make on their proprieties; And, greedily, unto themselves derive, The fatnesse, and the sweetnesse of the hive. Complaints in private, no redresse obtaining, Increast to open, and avow'd complaining: Which finding like successes, they begun To buz, as when their swarming time, draws on: Then, to shut up their cells, to shake their wings, To leave their wonted work, and shew their stings. The Drones, at first, were startled much thereat; But, being not so wise, as they are fat; Neglected still, the course which might prevent The mischief then appearing imminent: Which, when I saw, I would no longer stay; But, said, GOD help them; and so come away. This Parable, if rightly moralliz'd, Affords a meaning not to be despis'd. And so doth this which follows: as I went On Pilgrimage unto the Parliament, Dispersed in my way, I saw the cocks, (Which kept the hens, and capons from the fox) With broken wings, with backs, without a feather To hide their naked bodies, from the weather; With plumelesse tails, with scarred necks and brests; With empty bellies, and with combs, and crests, Cut quite away; and scraping with their feet On dunghills, for their food, and in the street, So despicably, that it could appear By nothing save their spurs, what once they were: And, Popinjaies, and Parrets, cloath'd and fed, By what the valour of these purchased, (And, trim'd with ill got feathers) strutted by, Casting upon them a disdainfull eye: Which when I saw, methought (I tell you true) It was no good presage; pray, what think you? News, if you look for, I but little know, Save, such as this next Parable doth show. A fair ship, now lies floting on the floods, Well fill'd with Passengers, well fraught with goods, Labring to fix an Anchor on the strand Of her wish'd harbor, which lies neer at hand. By many stormes, much tackling, she hath spent; Her Masts are shater'd; and her shrowds are rent: Her ammunition, and her stores are wasted, Her bread and bevorage is evill tasted: Her keel springs leaks, through her uncawked seams; Her knees are weakned, bruized are her beams: Her Pump is broke, no Cable sound hath she; And, Anchors have been slipt, till none there be: Her Helm hangs loose, her Cards have great defects; Her compasse likewise often misdirects: And ev'ry where, she crazinesse doth feel, From Prow to Stern, from topmast, to the Keel. In this condition, too and fro she drives, And, on the waves, with much ado, yet lives: For, now of late again, the Seas go high; A stiff gale blows, and she expos'd doth lye To many hazards, close without the Bar, Betwixt two Forelands, which in kening are: If she were fitted, forth again to stand To Seaward, Pyrats threaten; if to Land She makes; the rocks lye scattered, here and there, In which, as great, or, greater dangers are: And, which is worse, they, who in her abide, Are mutinous; and, somwhat els beside: Some ignorant, some trecherous, and, some Ambitious, how, possessors to become Of what is other mens: yea, some of those Who, have this goodly ship at their dispose, Have in delayes, their time, and stores, mispent, For private ends; or, for accomplishment Of worse designes: and, in this great distresse, (In part through fear, in part through guiltinesse) So much amuz'd, and so amuzed are, That, they are at a losse, what course to steer, Themselves to save; and compasse their design; Without which, to no course, they will incline The Owners, and the Passengers, have waved No means, whereby this Vessell might be saved: For, to that purpose, they have not alone, Put hand, to all things needfull to be done; And, faithfully, unto their labour stood; (Ev'n with the frequent hazard of their blood) But also, willingly away have cast Their goods; yea, some have thrown forth to the last Of all their outward visible estates: Few of her Masters, or her Masters Mates, In her extremities, adventring ought; Although their Cabbins, with rich goods are fraught. The danger still increaseth; and those few In place of trust, who to their trust are true, Perceiving all endeavours rendred vain By their decrease, to whom doth appertain That Vessells charge; they labour'd seriously To find out an expediment, whereby Some other Pilots might be timely sent Their neer approaching shipwrack, to prevent. And, that by making of their Canons roar, They might invite help, from the neighbring shore. The motion pleased all, save such as had Self-ends to fear; and, these a faction made So strong against it, that, this Vessell, yet Hulls there, with many perills, round beset; Not knowing (without hazard) either how To ride safe, tack about, or venture through The narrow Channell; whose hid winding lies Obscured from their knowledge, and their eyes: And, one dark night, or, but one tempest more, Might wrack her on the sands, or on the shore. But, maugre all these hazards; she at last, In her wish'd harbour, shall an anchor cast; For, to the Leeward, lies an unseen Bay, Where, through the soft Ouze, run aground she may Without a bruize; and, shall recruits take in, Ev'n where 'twas fear'd, she should have splitted bin. You therefore, who conceive your interest To be concern'd by what is here exprest, Praise God alone, when fafe this Ship shall be, For none could have secured her, but he. And let not those, to whom the same relates Slight what this Parable insinuates, Which next ensueth: for, it hath an use, That much to their advantage may conduce. A homebred Lion (of a hair unknown In Africa) by being overgrown, And dreadfull to his Keepers, will thereby Awake the rage of smother'd jealousie, And lose his tail; except between his pawes, He couch his head, and hide his teeth and clawes; Or Rampant grow; and what will follow then? Ask those you credit, they are Cunning men: Of me you ask in vain; for 'tis my fate, Seldome to be believ'd, till 'tis too late. But that stout Lion by his prudency May easily improve this jealousie, Both for the Publike safety, and th'increase Of his own honor, also, if he please; And I do probably presume he will, If my well-wishes, have not fool'd my skill. Before that time, they who have took delight In deeds of darknesse, will put out the light By which the footsteps of their foes are known, And whereby they might see to guide their own: Insteed whereof, perhaps erect they shall An ignis fatuus, which will hazard all. To each man then shall Providence dispose That, which for his chief happinesse he chose: The dogs, who to their vomit do retire, And swine (who love to wallow in the mire) Themselves with their beloved filth shall fill; And they that are unclean, shall be so still. The wilfull Adder, who doth stop his ears, And will not heed the Charmer whom he hears, Shall feel a voice within him, that will shake him Out of his dumps; and from his deafnesse wake him, When 'tis too late to hear what might prevent The dint of his forewarned detriment. The Leaches shall by salt a vomit take; Or els continue sucking, till they break. The Bubbles, who in emptinesse do find Their pleasure, shall be puffed up with wind Till (being blown to nothing) there appear No signes, that in the world such bladders were. The sons of earth, who with the Gods make war, Shall heap up hills on hills, till crusht they are Ev'n by their own Designes; the Dogs that prey Upon their Flocks, and tear their wool away, Shall bark no more, but only snarle and grin, And run about the fields without a skin. The shrubs and Briars, which more proud are grown, Then were the Cedars, lately broken down; Among their leaves and thornes, a fire do hide, Which on a suddain will consume their pride. The grubs and maggots, but e'rewhile so small, So poor and weak, that they could hardly crawl, Have got bulk, strength, new formes, aspiring wings; Yea dreadfull teeth, and horns, and claws, and stings: But, by a storm, whereof they have no dread, They shall consume as fast as they were bred: Within the circuit of our Northern Clime Not long before, or after these, in time, Out of the putrified barbed steed, Shall generated be a num'rous breed Of noysome hornets, which abroad will fly, Much mischief doing, and next winter die. Friends possibly may meet (our Proverb sayes) But mountains never; yet in these our dayes, That Proverb's crost: for hills have often met, With purpose on each other to beget A long'd for issue; and it is believ'd By many, that they somewhat have conceiv'd Of great concernment: but you'l see the birth Prove nothing, but a moldring lump of earth; (As they themselves will be, till clay and dust, Seek better things, then to fulfill their lust:) For none can answer now our expectation, But that great hill, whence cometh our salvation. All this from objects which are found within Our British Orb, hath preconjectur'd bin; But those that follow next, to me appear By things which I observe without our sphere. The blasted Orange, and the crooked Vine, With many trees on either side of Rhine Shall twist together, that beneath their shade, A shelter for the Thistle may be made, Till they perceive what curse is in pursuit Of that rejected plant, root, branch, and fruit; And then they'l wiser grow; lest they may become Exposed justly to the self-same doom. Mean while, the tawny Olive shall assay His roots into those Vallies to convay, From whence it was displanted; and effect His purpose, by a Wile which few suspect; Except the Willow, and the Oke foresee What for their mutuall good should thought on be: And both the frogs and mice, which are in sight, Be wary what is watch'd for by the Kite. By which means they shall break a grand design Which is on foot, their States to undermine; And they who of this Peace first movers are, Shall of that blessing reap the greatest share. Observe this well: if ever you shall see (As possibly it may permitted be) That from it height, the RED-CROSSE shall decline, The half moon for that time shall Northward shine, (With an ill influence upon the Seas) Beyond the Pillars of great Hercules, And Southward not be retrograde again, Till that a reascension shall attain. But losses are sometimes a gainfull prize; By over-sights, men grow to be more wise; And they who know not yet what may concern Their welfare, will perhaps more wisdome learn, When more experience makes their judgment stronger, By suffering losse and scorn a little longer. We, on this side the water, are not yet Confus'd enough that Order to beget, Which must estadlish us; and shall therefore Pursue self-interest, a little more. With new wine our old bottle must be fil'd, (Endangring wine and bottle to be spil'd) Till such as are in powre be pleas'd to hear The counsell of a slighted engineer: With new cloth our old garment patch'd must be, (Whereby the rents made wider ye shall see) Till every old rag be worn out, and then The Robe so rent, shall be renew'd agen: And they that own it, be secured more, And much more dignifi'd, then heretofore; If they who must compleat it make their choice, By lot divine, as well as humane voice: Whereto self-seekers never will agree, Untill inforced by some streights it be. But when this comes to passe, there shall appear A new light shining in our hemisphere, That will disperse the clouds and fogs, which make So many crosse each other, and mistake The way of safety; then we shall perceive Our Opposites desire to interweave Their interests with ours; and to have share In that which God will for these Isles prepare: Wherein if we accord, we shall possesse Each other, and the world in Christian peace; Till he approacheth to ascend the Throne, Who must unite all Nations into one. Then shall the blazing Comets, which have seem'd Fixt stars, and been by many so esteem'd, (Ev'n of the greatest magnitude) down from Their heights be thrown; and more despis'd become Then Glowormes, or those rotten chips, that glare In darknesse, as if reall lights they were. Then ev'ry single person shall be brought Unto his Test; and that which he hath wrought Shall passe a fiery Triall, such as were Made fat with publike spoils; and cloathed are By ruining of others; will that day Be hungry, poor, and naked sent away, And rendred the scorn of ev'ry one, Whom they opprest, despis'd, and trampled on. Then they, who large indulgences contrive For others, that themselves they may forgive; Who cunning are, at fast and loose to play; Who take to morrow, what they give to day; Who make their seeming favours, means unto Those mischiefs, which their malice could not do. Who Spider-like, weave cobwebs, with pretence To catch the noysome flies which give offence. When none but harmlesse Bees their engines take, For, through them wasps and hornets passage make. They, who do sacrifice unto the dead That wherewithall the living should be fed; Ev'n when they (wanting what should life preserve) Lie naked, harbourlesse, and like to starve. Then such as Innocencies cause betray, And justifie the wicked, then shall they Who add more grease to fatnesse; and where's none Scrap't off, the flesh that's left unto the bone. Then shall all these, and such like, to their doom With fear, with trembling, and amazement come, And undergo deserved punishment, Unlesse beforehand timely they repent: In which condition they may yet receive Remission, and in future safety live. Then also they, who now are forc'd to take The juicelesse apples of Asphaltis Lake, (Insted of that which was the price of blood, Limbs liberty, and of their livelyhood) Shall better be rewarded; and confesse There is a GOD that loveth righteousnesse. Then they who have received stones for bread, (Scorpions for fish) shall with good things be fed. Then they, who serv'd like Tantalus have bin (With fruits and waters, which their lips and chin Have often touch'd in vain) shall that enjoy, For which they fruitlesse labours now employ: Yea, they who got but gall and vineger, When in their greatest Agonies they were, Shall see what Sampsons Riddle hath imply'd, On them, and their oppressors verifi'd: Out of their eaters carkasses, will meat Extracted be; and sweetnesse they shall get Out of the bones and ruines of the strong, By whom they formerly received wrong. Then ravenous Wolves, shall Lambs and Kidlings feed, The thistly field shall bring forth pretious seed: The Crocodile shall tears of kindnesse weep; The Ramping Lion, to the cross shall creep: And such things as were noysome heretofore, Shall make our future benefit the more. Then, from the buried Oxe, will forth arise, A swarm of thrifty honey making flies, That shall with sweetnesse, and with plenty store These Ilands, from the midland, to the shore; And, spread their floting hives o're all the Seas, 'Twixt both the Tropicks, to th'Antipodes, (And all without) that blessings which now are Somewhere enjoy'd, may then be ev'ry where; To make preparatives for that which brings Into one body, all dispersed things. Other events, that seem of consequence, I do foresee approachings, not far hence: But so obscurely, that I cannot say (Without some doubtings) whereto tend they may For, far beyond my apprehension lies The chain of those conceal'd contingencies Which draw on future things: and that frail glasse Through which the light, disclosing them, must passe, Is so defective, that it may perchance Misrepresent them in some circumstance. Yet by th'inlightnings, which the sacred Writ On sanctified reason doth beget, If we will weigh, consider, and compare Those WORDS and works, which past and present are, To GOD and men relating; we of some Things future, may aright inform'd become. Yea, out of question, by these are foreshown To all intents, as much as need be known, Relating either to our private fates, Or unto Kingdomes, Commonwealths, and States: Jf thereto, for the right end, men apply Their sense in faith, and with humility. To find what sense my Parables contain, No man that's wise, shall need his wits to strain; For e're three years, are three moneths past the middle Most men the meaning of them will unriddle, Without an Oedipus; and think that he Who made them, had Cassandra's destiny. But these meer trifles are, respecting that Of whose approach I tydings can relate: For long it shall not be, e're that be done Which will cut off all tyrannies in one: Yea that which many thousands have expected, Hundreds of years, shall fully be effected, Before the Wheel of Time, now rowling by Hath past M. D. C. L. X. V. and I. Which numbers how to calculate aright, From this that follows take a little light. First, to begin it, you must learn to find What year the Roman Empire first declin'd, All whose Characters, us'd in numeration, Thus plac'd, according to their valuation, Explain a mystery: for of that State Whereto they did belong, they shew'd the date: And at that season 'twill compleated be, Jn which Rome looks for her next JUBILEE. My Ridling fit now leaves me for a time; And here J'le put a period to my Rhime. My inward perturbations are past over, My brains begin, by setling, to recover Those wits, whereby I may, like other men, Converse; and follow my affairs agen. My night adventures I have passed thorow, And they who meet me in the streets to morrow Will scarce believe how mad I was this night, Untill they shall peruse what I now write; And most of them, will then, (it may be) deem, That others are more mad, then I yet seem. The Perpetuall PARLIAMENT. BEING The Result of a Contemplative Vision, revealing a probable meanes of making this Parliament to be both perpetuall, and acceptable to these Nations, if they so please. A Paradox, though this appear to some, Consider it, lest els, a mischief come. Is that design'd? then it is time to vary My Theme, lest, on a suddain, all miscarry. Riddles adieu, let clouds away be blown, And my Dark Lantern, quite aside be thrown; That e're it be too late, I down may charm The Spirits conjur'd up, to do us harm: For in my contemplations I have had A Vision, which hath some discov'ries made, And in a plain song I intend to sing, How we may concord, out of discords bring, Order out of confusions, and restore That Peace, whose late infringements we deplore; Where, to begin the work; how to proceed, That which is yet but words, may be a deed, And to declare our means of settlement, To be an everlasting Parliament. It may appear, (and will be thought perchance) At least much rashnesse, if not arrogance, That I adventure to employ my pen Upon a subject, which more able men Have hitherto declin'd, and which of late, Hath ground administred of much debate, (And much dispute) to Counsells of renown, Without a full resolve, as yet made known: But these are blasts, whereof small heed I take, For chaffe and feathers only, they can shake; And he that all things hath at his dispose, Is pleased some expedients to disclose To poor and simple persons, now and then, Which he conceals from wise, and noble men: He, sometimes calls men from within the grates, To Counsell grave, and mighty Potentates; And they in meeknesse have embrac'd the same Without a jealousie of any shame Which might thereby reflect disparagements Upon their wisdome, from those instruments. Nor is there any cause, why such as are Made instrumentall, those things to declare Which may be serviceable, should therefore Esteem their wisdome, or themselves the more; Since they have nothing, but what they receive, And are but earthen pipes, to help derive To others, what into themselves they take, Not so much for their own, as others sake. And if assume ought to my self I would, J nothing know, that arrogate J could By what shall be proposed, more then they, Who have not to this end a word to say, Jf they desire to serve you; when they shall Meet such occasions, as J met withall. For, as when two great Armies, long ingag'd, Having each others fury so inrag'd, That over all the fields there are bespread, Disorders rais'd out of despair and dread; Such renovations on the hills and vallies, Of charges and retreats; of routs and rallies, So loud a noyse of drums, and guns, and cries; Such clouds of smoke and dust to blind their eyes; Such stops by them that slain and wounded ly, Such throngs and tumults among those that fly, And, such confusions, that the Chief Commanders Know not what course to take; if then, by-standers, Upon a neighb'ring hill, shall thence discern Where some advantage lies, which may concern Their friends ingag'd; and from among them one Shall (ventring down) inform them what is done; Where their foes weakness lies; and how they may Rally their broken troops, and win the day, What great thing hath he done, whereof to boast? Or what dishonor hath that Army lost, By his officiousnesse? or what's his gains But knocks perhaps, or woundings for his pains; From those, it may be, of his Party too, Who know not what he thither came to do. This is my case; who for such services, (And such adventures heretofore as these) Have gain'd so little, that none needs envy The profit which J have receiv'd thereby; Or, those advantages J might expect, Jf that which J propose should take affect; Considering, how many still there be, To make my best deeds mischievous to me. But, whatsoever shall thereon succeed With what is now intended, I'le proceed, As my peculiar work; and to be done By no man, if I let the same alone. For, (as it by my Journall Books appears) Somwhat above the term of forty years I have been on the hills of contemplation, A voluntary Watchman for this Nation. I, oft, when none to second me I knew, In times of greatest danger stood perdue. I oft was pris'ner took, and did inlarge My self, at all times, at my proper charge. I, more then once, to scape my Foes made shift, With nothing, but my life, and raiment left; And have perswaded been (ev'n ever since J reacht the years of ripe intelligence) That (next unto his service) GOD, in chief, Gave me my being, faculties and life, To serve my Country, and to have an eye On those who hindred her prosperity; And, to imploy my studies and my wit, Jn searching out what might advantage it, Though no man should regard it; yea, though still J injuries receiv'd for my good-will: And this hath oft produc'd such fruits as these, Judge me, or use me for it as they please; J shall, at last, be paid for all J do: And, so shall they, who dare oppose it too. Having thus prefac'd, to anticipate Miscensures, J, my Visions thus relate. When with sad thoughts J many nights and dayes, Had over-look'd my one, and others wayes, Considering seriously, both what they were And in what posture, our affairs now are; I saw so much confusion, and disorder, The Chaos daily, so much widing further By new confusions, and so few, that see Or credit, in what hazards we now be, That in these overwhelmings I almost Was swallowed up, in danger to be lost: And doubtlesse in those whirlpools lost had bin, But that the clew, by which I ventur'd in, Did bring me forth, and set me on a Station Where I might view them, without perturbation; With safety too, and with so true a light That, thereby plainly, I discover might From whence this Chaos springs; and by what course We might (if possible) drink up rhe source, Or make some such diversion, as would win An entrance, where good order might begin. As I stood musing, how this could be done, A voice within me said; this works for none But him to do, who first did out of nought Bring something; and from something, all things brought. Then said my heart, LORD, though this work, to thee Belongs alone, yet instruments there be, By which thou workest all things here below; Some instrumentall means, now therefore show, Whereby this may be done; and, then alone Shal't reap that honor which insues thereon. Insteed of vocall answer hereunto, A firm perswasion, that it should be so Possest my soul; and that he whosoever Would faithfully and seriously endeavour A restauration, either should acquire The full accomplishment of his desire; Or so much toward it, as might at least Secure him in his noble interest. Herewith well satisfi'd, aside I threw My own affairs, and privately withdrew Into my self, in season to begin That undertaking which I now am in; And whereto you, by these long lanes are led, To signifie that I've considered The Propositions, which to light I bring, With good precautions, and examining. One afternoon, as on my couch I lay, About the ev'ning twilight of the day, My contemplation introduced there, A mask, that might beseem a theater; And many grave spectators: for thereby Was represented our late tragedy From that time, when the Prologue did begin, Ev'n to the very act, we now are in; With each materiall circumstance, which might, Be usefully presented to my sight, Pertaining to this Nation, and to those Who are, or have been, thereto friends or foes. It likewise drew a map before mine eyes, Of all our past, and present miseries, With those distractions, and those contradictions VVhich do prolong or multiply afflictions: As also of each actor and his actions Confusedly wrapt up with their transactions, As they to me, and other men appear, When we do look upon them in our fear; Or as they passed by us day by day, Whil'st we among the same confusions lay. This mummery withdrew: and then me thought, It back again, each part and actor brought, Distinctly represented, so that I Might perfectly discern with reasons eye, What in themselves they were; and that we had Of many things a wrong conjecture made. That some, which to our practise were commended, Have to our shame, and our destruction tended: That others, which we judged might destroy Our interest; produc'd what we enjoy. That wicked projects, otherwhile brought forth As good effects, as those of reall worth, (Though not without a woe, to them, by whom Offences, and prevarications come) That some, which good appear'd, were nothing so, That, others, making but an evill show, Were (if consider'd simply) very good, Or, better then they seem'd, if understood According to the time, and present state Of these affairs, whereto they did relate. A Curtain then was drawn aside, that shew'd A Table, whereon portraited I view'd A Directory, teaching me the use Of all that I had seen, with their produce: Which could my memory, have brought away, Had done this work (which I intend to day) Much better, then this picking out again, What their impression left upon my brain. A thousand sev'rall things (some, neither fit For my expression, nor in season, yet To be divulg'd) were brought as in procession Before me, in an orderly progression. Sometimes confusedly, there passed by Strange Apparitions, which away did fly, E're I could well discern them; or my thought Take notice, to what purpose they were brought. Sometimes bright shinings from a light I had, Which cheer'd my heart, and made my spirit glad. Another while, a darknesse me surrounded, Which, all my notions, for a time, confounded, And sadned so my spirit by privations, That I well neer lost all those observations Which I had made sometimes appear'd to me Such things, as in our Antimasks we see Ridiculous, and worthy laughing at; Sometimes things terrible, and after that Appearances, which promised to some, Much comfort, peace, and happinesse to come; And so the Vision vanish'd, and the day By that time to the night had given way. But by what represented thus hath been, By well considering what I have seen; (By spelling out, what every character Held forth, and what things evidenced were By readring all together) found hath bin Where that great work must first of all begin, Which may make up our breaches, when thereto Our selves we settle, as we ought to do. In brief, I saw, that in the settlement And constitution of this Parliament Upon a just foundation laid with speed, A course of restauration might succeed; And draw on by degrees, a means to bring Into right order, ev'ry other thing Conducing to our Weal; and if we take That way whereof proposall I shall make, I dare adventure, if it do not thrive, To lose my head, or be inter'd alive. I have attain'd assurance (and without So much as any shadow of a doubt) That by this Parliaments misconstitution We are uncapable of that fruition Which we expect; that for the most part thence Proceed the causes of our indigence And myseries; and that 'tis naythelesse The chief, or sole means left of our redresse. Ev'n this in being now, this which men seek To bring into contempt, and to dislike. This, which they (justly too, in some respect) Have laboured to make of no effect, And to annihilate, as if thereby (And thereby only) they should perfectly Injoy their full desires, and be secur'd From all the troubles hitherto indur'd. Ev'n by this Parliament, God will effect That future settlement which we expect, If we too long delay not the pursuit Of an impartiall rativall recruit. For though the body of it being made Of many members, hath among them had (And hath yet) overmany so corrupted That they have not alone much interrupted: The activenesse of those that have been sound, But are oft likely also to confound The whole at once, by seeking how to please Their lusts, or friends, or how themselves to ease: Yet by their faithfulness, who have been true Unto their trust, and active to pursue The publike interest, redeem'd we are From that captivity in which we were; And many things enjoy of him esteem (Though by some wants, enjoyments lesse do seem) Whereof we had e're this been quite dispoil'd, If they in their endeavours had been foil'd. It therefore were an Act of Tyranny, (Of high injustice, and of cruelty) To wrap up these, with those that have misdone, Because some fail, to have respect to none; But cast off all at once, and from us thrust With men unrighteous, those that have been just. For if we weigh things well, it is their praise, That they have marched through uneven wayes, (Oft, ill accommodated) and have long Opposed without wearinesse, a strong And cunning enemy; that they have bin Assail'd by some without, and stob'd within By bosome foes; that they were lamed too, In their own limbs, yet forward still did go With perseverance: and that also they Stand for us in the gap, ev'n to this day; It is their glory, rather then their blot, Though their good purpose they accomplish not. It is from these that we denominate This Parliament; in them is lodg'd the fate Of this Republike; yea, what e're it seem, This, as I said, is that which must redeem Our late lost honor; and if e're this shall Dissolved be, down all our Structures fall, Not to be rais'd, without the cost of more Then hath been spent upon it heretofore. For what should keep it up? can wise men think, They shall uphold it, that it may not sink, Whom these depute? who while they do subsist, Preserve, with much care, their own interest? Can any of us, reasonably believe The power which to their Substitutes these give, When they themselves are outed, shall be able To keep up strongly, that which is unstable, Untill a Phœnix, yet unhatch'd arise Out of their ashes, with renew'd supplies? When, having far lesse power, and lesse esteem, (As being an extraction out of them Who are prejudicated) they shall contend With those immergencies, that may ascend? But, grant it possible, what way shall we Contrive, whereby this power dissolv'd may be Without a force, that may indanger more Our safety, then it hath done heretofore? (Since by a Law, it was perpetuated Which is not rashly to be abrogated; And which without inforcement, can by none Repealed be, save by it self alone?) It were not rationall we should petition That they now sitting (weighing their condition) Dissolve it should, till they can be assured, How they may for the future be secured, For giving their intrusted power away, To those they know not; or, to such as may Ruine both them, and those too, for whose sake, They serv'd, that reasonlesse resolve to make; Yea, should they leave to such uncertainties, (And, to such hazards, as might thence arise) This Commonwealth, it were an Act unjust, And, an unanswerable breach of trust. This Parliament, though (by and for our sin) Her vigorous actings have delayed bin, Through those obstructions, which it long hath had, And, is by many foul bespatterings made Unacceptable; though, that it should raign O're them, the sons of Belial, do disdain: Although, some also (without cause) have thought That, to defame it, I my self, have sought (Because thereto misunderstandingly, They such invectives, and reproofs apply, As were intended only against those, Who seeming to be friends, were secret foes.) Yet since it first begun (ev'n all along) I have perceiv'd what works thereto belong, And ever had a care how to prevent Their scandall, by a plain distinguishment Of Doves from Crowes, and of mens private factions, From publike, and authorized transactions. For as that man, who can nor hear, nor see, And half whose limbs, corrupt and rotten be, May possibly be all the means reserv'd, By which a noble house may be preserv'd From extirpation; so, how bad soe're This Parliament may be, (or may appear) I am assur'd, by many a circumstance, It is that means by which GOD will advance This Commonwealth, unto that settlement, Which may accursed Anarchy prevent, If those conditions be not long neglected, Whereby our happiness may be effected. As heretofore, when Sarah was bereav'd Of that which gave her hope to have conceiv'd, She, naythelesse, obtain'd a lovely son, In whom a num'rous Off-spring was begun: And whence did spring that light, and that salvation, Which is the happiness of ev'ry Nation; Ev'n so, when we had wanted many a year, The likely Symptoms of enjoying here, Another Parliament; yea when a stop Was raised and proclaim'd, against the hope Of such a mercy, when nought did appear But that whereby dispairs increased were: VVhen Tympanies had swoln our Sarahs womb, And made it rather seem to be the Tomb Of dead things only, then to quicken ought, VVhich for our comfort could from thence be brought; Lo, then, (and not before) it did conceive A son of Consolation, to revive Our drooping hearts; and which, if faithlesnesse Deprive us not of what we may possesse, Will free us from all tyrants, and restore Those rights which they usurped heretofore: And not restore our liberties alone, But propagate the blessing here begun, Throughout the world, untill all other Nations Are freed from their Oppressors usurpations. Before the sons of Jacob entrance found Into their promis'd Land, they had a round, Or Progress to fulfill, and many years They in the Desarts were Probationers, By sev'rall hardships, thereby to improve The seeds of faith, new sown at their remove From Ægypt, and by signs and wonders shown) To make unto themselves their frailty known. But they at each restraining of their lust, Brake forth into repinings and distrust; Yea into flat rebellions, into rearing Of Idols (when his Law GOD was preparing) Into a wicked causlesse murmuring Against the means of their delivering From Ægypts thrall; and into wishes vain That they might thither back return again. For which of many hundred thousands none Enjoy'd the promis'd rest, but two alone. And we are just like tkem; yea, we have done Since God, to bring us from our thrall begun, The very same things in the wildernesse Of our Probation, and our carkasses Shall there be left, unless we do betimes Make an attonement, for our passed crimes; And with unfainedness that course pursue Which leads unto the rest, that is in view. So shall our Leaders, likewise, who comply With such transgressors, and unsanctifie Their power: so shall, moreover, those Who with our Dathans, and Abirams close In their conspiracies, and quite from all Their likely hopes, and present glory fall. For on conditions, (as King Jehu had His Throne) the peoples heads, they have been made, And if they shall from those conditions swerve, They must expect the portion they deserve. Let them endeavour, therefore, how they may Remove that fear and jealousie away Which doth possesse the people, and withdraws Their good affections, with apparent cause: Let those, (ev'n those, who have among the rest, Been least to blame, and have deserved best) Consider, that by such as carelesse are Of those great burthens, which they seem to bear, The weight increaseth, and, that they so fast Decrease, on whom their weightiness is cast, As will e're long o'rewhelm them, if with speed, They do not to some remedy proceed. Let them take notice, that the people rage At their delayes, as likely to ingage In some disorderly resolve, unless They see that follow'd with more seriousness Which they desire; either a Parl'ament New made, or somewhat that's equivalent: For thereby, they conceive, (and that thereby Alone) their sufferings may have remedy. And somewhat to that end (although not so As most would have it) may be fit to do. Yea, if I have not misadvised bin, Our cure must with the Parliament begin. Assist ye therefore, to promote the same, Lest ye partake with sinners in their shame. There is a course, whereby without disgrace, Or danger, you may bring that work to pass, And free your selves from that great cost and pain, Which without thanks, or profit you sustain; Afflicting others too, by those confusions Which are increast by your irresolutions. Untill a better, therefore shall appear, Be pleased that expediment to hear, And, if of those preventions, or that good, It promiseth, you find a likelyhood, Take heed, that no self-interest, divert That Approbation, whereunto your heart Inclineth you; for God will find it out, And cross the counter-work you go about. In England, and in Wales, there is a Shire, For ev'ry week that's numbred in the year. By twelve, according to the moneths divide The Counties, with their persons qualifi'd For Knights and Burgesses, proportioning As neer as may be, to an equalling The number of the whole, so, or so many Unto each moneth, without omitting any. Ascertain then, the moneth and day, wherein Each twelfth part an election shall begin; (The middle of the week, appearing best As being furthest from the day of rest) On each first Wednesday, of each moneth, let those By whom their Deputies are to be chose, Respectively convene in ev'ry Shire, Upon that moneth, and Wednesday ev'ry year, Which is to them assign'd; and having chosen, (At moneths end) let each twelfth part, of the dozen, Send up their chosen men, to represent Their Shires and Boroughs in the Parliament: And on that very day, in which they come, Let all their Predecessors give them room. Thus one moneth some; and moneth by moneth for ever, Let each twelfth part, still orderly persever To take a turn, till ev'ry share hath had A moneth in ev'ry year; and having made Their choice, let them still enter and withdraw Successively, by a perpetuall Law, No man a place of trust, supplying there, At one election, longer then one year. Thus, as the Thames, doth still continue one, And is the self-same river, though there run A new supply of waters ev'ry day Along the channell, so continue may This Parliament, by annuall supply, To be the self-same everlastingly, With very little charge or molestation To those who chuse, or represent the Nation. Thus may this Parliament, be both together Successive, and perpetuall; yet neither Enjoying such a perpetuity As can occasion future tyranny, Or present grievances; nor that succession, Which may bring danger by an intermission: But make that constitution, which will add All power, which may from both of them be had, Either to compass, what good men affect; Or to prevent the mischiefs they suspect, What I intend may plainly be conceiv'd; And to that end, some things may be contriv'd Much better, if your wisdome shall refine The rudeness of my profered design; And by authority, some rules provide Whereby th'elected may be qualifi'd; And their Electors too; for 'twere unjust, In things of this concernment, those to trust Who have disturb'd our Peace, untill a time For their Probation be allotted them: And till they likewise, by some good desert, Make manifest a reconciled heart, Atested, and approved by those Judges, Who shall suspend their former priviledges. And since, ev'n they who are the best affected To Publike welfare, often have elected Such as deceive their hopes; since ther's no eye But GODS, that sees the hearts hypocrisie: Since it appeareth in the best Record, (Ev'n in the volumes of the sacred Word) That lots were needfull in the choice of those, On whom they did a Supreme Trust impose: Yea, since, ev'n when the purest Congregation, In all the world, had with deliberation, (And from among the most approved men, Which to their knowledge liv'd among them then) Elected two; a lot was also cast, That GODS Election might on theirs be plac'd, To send forth him, who was to be employ'd In executing of the place then void: Since also GODS Election, joyn'd with our, May peradventure on the Elected pour New gifts; since we by doubtlesse warranty May with that antient President comply: Since it will probably give good content To prudent men, and may oft times prevent The choice of those, whom for sinister ends, A numerous corrupted Party sends: Why may not? nay, why should not two be chose For ev'ry place that's void, and one of those Be sent by lot? that GOD may have a voice, And joyn with men in making up their choice? Since they, who must this Nation represent Are GODS Vicegerents in the Government, As well as our Trustees? who would not more Confide in such a choice, then heretofore They did in others? or, then they will do In them, who shall not now be chosen so? Why was it not? why should it not be thus, If this the Kingdome be of GOD WITH US? But that self-seekers find, were this admitted, They by reputed fools, should be out-witted? And get no Julet, others to devoure Hereafter, by an evill gotten power? Yea, wherefore hath the lot been from among All our Elections kept away so long, But that Usurpers, and Intruders know It would their Kingdomes wholly overthrow; Make them afraid, that CHRIST would raign indeed Among us, (as they sometimes hear and read) And that they should hereafter never come To revel (as they have done) in his room: Nor will they, doubtless, if this take effect, Except it be our failings to correct; When GOD shall by permission for our sin, Reject the lot, and let a Knave come in. If therefore some Provision might be made, That we should lots to our Elections add, A great security would thence redound, And much contentment therein might be found. Moreover, as an out-work pertinent Remisseness in Electors to prevent, (Upon whose due performance much depends, Which to the publike woe, or welfare tends) It were not labour lost, if whensoe're To execute that duty we appear, Some short speech might be made, or cautions read, Whereby it should be offred to our heed, How much it will concern us, to take care What choice we make, and what the dangers are Which may ensue; lest for sinister ends, (For fear of great men, or to please our friends) We may displace our trust, and cast away Our selves, and all, for ever, in one day. To which intent, our Orator should show What trust it is, which we that day bestow: What benefits may gen'rally arise By chusing men couragious, honest, wise, And fearing GOD; what perills will ensue (Which by forepast examples he may shew) If cowards, fools, ungodly men, and vitious, Or to the present Government pernitious Elected be; he likewise may declare How qualifi'd such persons should appear, And warn them, that they never do unhallow Their choice, with any such as these that follow. Men over-talkative, and loving much To hear themselves speak; for not many such Can keep or give good counsell; and they'l prate Much precious time away, in vain debate. Your common Gamesters: for, they are unjust Unto themselves, and them we should not trust With other mens estates, who have been known To lose, or hazard, desperately their own. Men to their pleasure overmuch addicted, For Publike works, will be by these neglected. Such as apparently are Avaritious, Or of Promotion greedily ambitious: For if their ends thereby acquire they may, These may be hir'd, their Country to betray. Such as indulge their lust, and famed are In their uncleannesses to persevere; For they will leave their Charge, to please their whore, And shame their fellows, if they do no more. Of irreligious persons make no choice, For these will very seldom give their Voice, But in the Negative, to any motion, That may be for advancement of Devotion. Chuse none who are defam'd in any kind, As being vitious; for these means will find To hinder all enactings, which restrain Ill manners; or to sober life pertain. Elect not children: for it is unfit That in our Supreme Counsell they should sit, To Vote in Grand Affairs, whom Law restrains From managing, what to themselves pertains. Chuse none, who are observed to withhold, Their long due debts, when they discharge them could; Or outlaw'd persons; for, unfit are they To make our Lawes, who will not Lawes obey. Chuse none, who shall solicite, or propose That they for your Law makers may be chose; (And their Electors, by the old abuse, Of feasting, wine, and banquetings seduce:) For they, who shall uncall'd, themselves advance To that great work, have much more arrogance Then worth; and it is also ten to one, They for themselves, have something to be done. And lastly, take good heed, that none get in By your Elections, who have active bin Against this State, till you, of them have had Good proof, whereby secure you may be made: For he that hath into subjection brought, A Thief, who on the way, to rob him sought, And straight way trusts him, with his sword and horse, Takes not a very safe, or prudent course. This being done, (as in preceding ages) Let those who are Elected have their wages Well paid, and rendered proportionable To what the times require, to make them able To serve their Country in the Parliament Without their private cost or detriment: For both our Lawes, and equity requires, That Labourers should be allow'd their hires: Yea, 'tis a kind of bribery, in those Who offer, without wages to be chose; And Boroughs, which unable seem to beare That charge, not worth the representing are. Beside, their choice, is (for the most part) made By some Malignant Stewards; or, or'e aw'd By misaffected Landlords, to the wrong Of what to them, with others doth belong: And their objections are but cavillings, Who shall alledge, that these establishings Infringe their Antient Right: for, be it known, The Commonwealth no priviledge can own Destructive to it self: much rather, we, Who now, by Conquest, reinvested be With what was lost, are bound to settle it, Not as our foes wish, but as may befit The present, and the future preservation Of safety, peace, and freedome to this Nation. Moreover, as upon the House of Peers, It was the custome, in preceding years, That there the Sages of the Law, attended; To whose debate such points were recommended, As to the Law related; so, let some Selected be, and summoned to come To whom each matter questioned relates, To be advis'd withall, in their debates, As needfull it shall seem; whether the cause In controversie shall concern the Laws, War, Merchandize, or whatsoever may Require their best experience on the day Thereto assign'd: that ev'ry work begun May by it proper instrument be done. Which will prevent much doing, and undoing, And make new comers, in short time, as knowing, As they that have sate long, and finish more In three weeks, then in three moneths heretofore. These outworks, will much strengthen, and secure The works within: yet that they may endure All sieges, underminings, and scaladoes, Battries, assaults, and stormings, with Granadoes, By foes without, and treacheries within, To build a Cittadell, let us begin Upon some Fundamentalls; and provide They may for ever, unrepeal'd abide. Let it inviolably be decreed, That Cities, Shires, and Boroughs do proceed Once ev'ry year, upon the time assign'd, (On penalty of being deeply fin'd) To make Elections; that we never may For time to come, be headless for one day. Let it be everlasting banishment To him, who shall to change this Government From being a Republike, motion make: And to act further if he undertake, Let it be death, with totall confiscation Of his estate, without commiseration; Unless the great Disposer of all things, (Who, as he lifts, sets up and pulls down Kings) Shall thereto by a conquering power compell; And, not to do it then, were to rebell. Whoever with the publike Treasury Shall stand intrusted; and doth knowingly Defraud the Commonwealth; or shall purloine, (Whether it be in goods, or ready Coyne) The worth of twenty ounces in pure plate, Let it be loss of life, and of estate. Whoever this Republike shall betray Maliciously, or for advance or pay, Resigne his Trust; or cowardly give up What he had means to keep, or likely hope; Let it (when prov'd) be death without reprieving, Or any hope of temporall forgiving. Whoever shall from any foraigne State, Or Prince, take pension; or negotiate With them, or with their Agents, when they are With us in Treaties, or in open war, In State affairs, unless the State gives leave; Let him, without a pardon, death receive. Above a moneth together suffer none To sit hereafter in the Speakers throne, On some great penalty: Because thereby Both publike wrongs, and private injuries May be occasioned. Impose the like On him that shall absent himself one week From Parliament, without a good cause shown; Or, that without leave shall depart the Town. Let some appearance every day be made, That this great Body never want a Head That's visible; and to prevent what may, Unthought upon, befall us in a day. Yea, on the Sabboth, for an houre or two, Convene: for, 'tis a Sabboth-work you do: And Venice, hath by long experiment Found, that this Caution may be pertinent; Nor will it over-burthensome appear, When they are to continue but one year. Let none in Parliament have toleration To mention ought to their disreputation, Who absent are; except they undertake Of what they shall aver good proof to make, On pain of an expulsion; or, permit An Intimation, likely to beget A misconjecture, to the injury Of him, that is not present to reply: But let th'Accusers and their Accusations Be known, that those may have due vindications Who are traduc'd; For, no man should enjoy A priviledge, his neighbour to destroy. Moreover, lest the Parliament become (By multiplying Suits) more burthensome Then all those other Courts, of whose oppressions We have complain'd, (and render our conditions Less curable) let it admit no Cause But such as hath no remedy by Lawes In force; or, for a non-fruition Of Iustice, by their partiall execution. For, by removing of such grievances, And to provide against immergencies Which may occurr (both in affairs abroad, And here at home) they will have still their load. If not: the being of a Parliament Thus constituted, doubtless, will prevent So many mischiefs, that it will return Large recompences for all charges born. Let it expulsion be from thence, for ever, With some great mulct, for any whosoever, That, as a Member of the Parliament, Shall sit two years together; yea, though sent. And, let no Lawyers practise for a Fee, Or plead, whil'st of the Parliament they be: Or any, who there siteth as a Peer, Be Iudge of any supreme Court that yeer; Or, during that imployment, execute A Place, permitting not a Substitute; That, in Appeals, none may infringe the Lawes, By being Iudge and Partie in one Cause. And, that to all men, justice may be done, Among your Fundamentalls make this one; That whatsoever shall be taken from One, few, or many (through all times to come) In publike wants, and dangers, be repaid By equall Taxes, generally laid: And, that they shall not make, or abrogate A Law, diminishing one mans estate More then anothers, without recompence, On whatsoe're occasion or pretence. Yea, let all mens estates reduced be To lesse then forty shillings, yearly Fee, Rather then friend or foe, should justly say, The publike faith were broken, any way. Which would inrich us, and innoble more Then, if our hills of chalk, were silver Oar; Our sand pure gold; our pebles, pearls of price, Our fields as fruitfull as old Paradise; And, ev'ry son, which forth each mother brings, As Prince, or Lord, and all their Fathers Kings. Then to prevent, the drawing those together, Who, for by-ends, would fortifie each other; Let him that place in Parl'ament supplies, Who shall by letter, word, or otherwise, Either contrive, solicite, or propose Another, during that time, to be chose, Be from his Trust, exiled with disgrace, Never to be admitted, to that place. And, that all Fundamentalls ratifi'd In Parl'ament, for ever may abide Inviolated; let no man be sent A City, Town, or Shire, to represent, Till by Indenture, under hand and seal, He stand ingaged to the Common-weal, And his Electors, that by no endeavour, He shall repeal, or any way for ever Weaken these Fundamentalls; but assay, At all times, to inlarge them what he may: For, Parl'aments (as heretofore our Kings) Are but Trustees; and therefore in such things, As to the publike damage may redound, As well as they, shold Act within some bound. By these provisions, (with some other such Made Fundamentalls, we might very much Advantage this Republike; and as far As humane industries enabled are, (To promise safety and establishment) Secure from change the present Government, Till men may dry-shod walk upon the sand, From Deal, and Dover, Cliffs to Callis strand; Or, Penmin Maure, be set on Snow-down hills, And, Time unto their springs, turns back the rills. This, would be like the river, wherewithall The Tyrant Queller, clens'd th'Augean stall, (As Poets faign) and wash away that soil, And bloud, and filth, which doth our beauty spoil. By these means, we might both in one, contrive A true successive Representative, Compleated in a safe establishment, For ever, of the self-same Parl'ament, Producing all their just desires together, Who seek the one, or who desire the other; And with prevention of all harms, that may Be feared, by the one or other way. By these means, we shall never be without A Supreme power, or live in any doubt Of harmfull change, if wisely we pursue This course; and to our selves continue true. By these means, there will still be an appearance Sufficient, to keep up a perseverance, In all great undertakings, with due order, And with such quick dispatch, the suits to further Of men opprest; that, they may hope to see Those plaints determin'd, which yet endless be; And never will have end, till wit or force, Reduce us unto this, or some such course. By this expedient, they that are in place At present, may resign without disgrace The Trust they have, to take awhile their ease, (Or follow their affairs, as they shall please) And after one year, back perhaps return To reassume the burthens they have born. Hereby, a likely means will be contriv'd Of that security, which is deriv'd From many Counsellors: and, distribution Of burthens, will make easie execution; More quick, yea, and more cheap dispatches too, For those, who shall have ought with them to do. By these means, if, a worthlesse Member come Among our Worthies, to supply a room, His heart may changed be; whereas, now, they Who came in honest, are oft drawn away From their first Principles, with them to close, Who, mean to gain, what e're the Publike lose: Or, at the worst, he must from thence be gone Before much mischief, can by him be done. And, such as do confederate and plot That, for themselves, advantage may be got, (Though to their Countryes loss, and neighbors wrong) Shall want the time and means, which doth belong To such contrivements, as are frequent now, When, most, each others minds, and interests know: For, by new Parties, monethly, coming in, They'l break, as fast as they to knit begin; And, Gins, which heretofore effects have took By kindred and alliance, will be broke. By these means, they, who do command, to day, Shall learn again to morrow, to obey. Many, shall be encourag'd to enable Themselves, in publike, to be serviceable; And, in few years, some thousands more then now, The common interest, will learn to know; And, how they may advance it, when they come From that grand School, to live again, at home; And, think themselves, obliged, ev'ry where, To further it, as well as sitting there. By this means, ev'ry man, within his Orb Shall be restrain'd; and none have power to curb Supreme authority; or, to aspire By his ambition to a Station higher Then shall be safe to all, and judged fit For this free State, with prudence to admit: Nor shall the daringst tyrant in the land Presume to move a tongue, or lift a hand Against that power; or plot, vent, or concceal Ought which may damnifie this Common-weal. Yea, by this means, we calmly shall reduce The Parl'ament, unto it genuine use, Without advent'ring what may intervene By Intervalls; and, what hath feared been (Not without cause) by hazarding to call A new one; or, by an additionall Supply to this; as now affairs relate To home designs, and our next neighb'ring State: But, if we fail in any circumstance, Here mentioned, we never shall advance The Publike interest to that effect, Which by this Parliament we might expect; Nor scape that tyranny, which is design'd By those, who are contrarily inclin'd: For, they that would be tyrants (knowing those Who did the Regall tyranny oppose Still zealous, for the peoples liberty) Will to effect their purposes comply With any party; and, then, by displacing, By disenabling, or els by disgracing The well-affected, at last, compasse that Which is by them, in secret aimed at, (Unlesse prevented) and involve us more In servile slaveries, then heretofore. For, doubtless, most of those who did befriend The tyranny of Kings, will to that end Adhere to these, in hope by doing thus, To be reveng'd at last, on them and us. These are no such Proposalls, as may hatch A Cocatrice; or, be abus'd to catch A private interest. No impostures are Beneath a fair pretence obscured here: Nor doth their Author act the Mountebank To any end: For, he expects not thank For ought by him design'd; nor, cares for more But to discharge the debt upon his score; And (if occasion be) to find a gap, Through which, without a mischief, he may scape. Which, if he do, he will confess, 'tis more Then ever he could boast of heretofore; Or, any other, who thus interrupted The wilfull practise of a power corrupted, Unless that GOD, whom nothing can withstand, Secur'd him, by an over-ruling hand; Or, by a miracle did change their heart, As when he did great Nineveh convert. This is the sum of that, which I remember Kept me awake, some nights of this November, When my affairs, which then at hazard lay, Had tir'd in vain my body all the day; For, my necessities requir'd the one, My conscience cry'd, the t'other must be done; And, if, now ought the worse thereby I fare, My lot, as I am able, I will bear. Much more was represented to my view, Which I am unprepar'd (as yet) to shew, And you to hear: but, if I had a pen As acceptable, as some other men, (And undisturb'd) it might produce perchance, That, which the Publike weal, might much advance: Or, had I but a volubility Of tongue, to help my fluid memory; Or, durst declare my thoughts, e're them I see Array'd in words, that, weigh'd they first might be: Yea, could I speak, as many now can do, More in one hour, then they e're thought in two, (Or, then I can be understood in three) Much more esteem'd would my Proposalls be. Here I had fixt, but, that there comes to mind A supplement, remaining yet behind, Of somwhat represented, as relating Unto this Parliaments accommodating, With due conveniences; and with supply Of things pertaining to the Majesty Of Supreme Senates: For, though, doubtless, they Are best adorned, who themselves array With holiness; though, they have most renown When righteousness and mercy, is their Crown: And, though the dignity of Governments, Consisteth not in outward ornaments, Or, neat accommodations; yet, the wise, Having regard to mans infirmities, Did in all ages, by their joynt consents, Add to essentiall things, such accidents As might to those men, make their worth appear, Who could not see, what in themselves, they were: And, that they who discern'd it, might not find Discouragements, in that which is injoyn'd, To which end, we prescribe unto the sick, A gilded pill, and trim with Rethorick, Our Arguments, thereby to palliate What, we to others would insinuate. And, to this end, were tipifi'd to me, Some things, which will, perhaps, hereafter be. Mark them, if they be worth your heed: if not, Let them be passed over, as forgot. Methought, I saw WHITEHALL, new model'd out; With Tow'rs adorn'd, with strong walls fenc'd about; With buildings, having much variety Contriv'd into a neat conformity Of fair aspect, and duly beautifi'd With Gardens, walks, and with what els, beside, Did render it magnificently fit For their abode, who did inhabit it. Beside the Fabricks, destined unto Meer publike use, and common works to do; As, in the Firmaments wide Orb, there are Twelve mansions; so, twelve structures, saw I there, In each of which (as in the Zodiake, The twelve celestial signs, their Stations take) The Senators, who moneth by moneth, vvere chose, Had their distinct abodes; each one of those In lodgings, by himself; yet, altogether In one pile, vvho, in one moneth vvere sent thither: That, for conveniency they might be neer On all occasions; and, that ev'ry Shire, Might thereby find the easier addresses, And, quick dispatches in their businesses. A constant Table, of one meal a day, Was there prepared for a frugall pay, That none might be compelled to stray forth To places unbeseeming men of vvorth: And, all things pertinent to preservation Of health, vvith ev'ry fit accommodation, Was there contrived, so, as they might Pursue the Publike service, vvith delight. No family, was licens'd there, to host; No, not a wife (except a week, at most, In guest-wise) lest the publike services Might be disturb'd by houshold businesses: Or, least the drudgeries, or nastinesse, Occasion'd by a numerous accesse Of children, servants, and their visiters, Might spread diseases, in infectious years: And, lest among them, some, through want of grace, Might bring an evill name upon that place. Nothing uncomely, or disorder'd there Could I behold; no noyses did I hear, Or such loud clamors, as have oft been heard, Among the rude Jncommers, and the guard; But, such an awfull silence, as if there The Turks Grand Signior, always present were By Mutes attended. To offend the eye, Or smell, no dung, or sinks, did open lye. I saw not then, a despicable shed; No Coach hous'd there, or any Coach horse fed: No little children in the garden sprawling, Or, in the Galleries, or Chambers yawling: No Bakers Boy went tooting of his horn: No Milk pails there, from place to place were born, As in those Courts, and Allies which we see Pester'd with Inmates, and poor lodgers be: Nor was there born through any passage there, (Save such, as out of common concourse were) Unseemly burthens, or, ought els permitted But what the honor of the place befitted. A Guard was needlesse then for their defence, (Since, justice, mercy, and true innocence, Are guard enough, and keep more safe, by far, Then if an armed Phalanx doubled were) They had true peace within; and through the land No man against them, durst to lift a hand; But, ev'ry one was ready to attend them, And with their lives, as their life, to defend them. Yet, for magnificency, and to further The preservation of respect and order, In times of concourse; and that no address Be made, but with all due respectiveness, They had an able Band of men selected Out from among those persons well-affected, Whose faith and valour had been well approved In publike services; who, had unmoved Stood firm in trialls, and whose conversation Had gained them an honest reputation; And these, arm'd, govern'd, decently array'd In liveries alike, and duly paid, Appear'd to give attendance altogether When Princes, or Ambassadors came thither: And, in their turns, at other times, to do, That service, which they were injoyn'd unto. Then, forasmuch, as outward habits draw Respect unto mens persons, there, I saw That custome, which all Senators did hold In strict observance, through most times of old, The Knights and Burgesses who represent The Nation, entred not the Parliament In common habits only; but, each one A robe, or upper garment, did put on Peculiar to that Senate, differing neither In fashion, stuffe, or colour from each other. To signifie (as I conceive) thereby Their brother-hood, and their equality; And that, they being thereby differenced From vulgar persons, might be honored According to their place, and known among, And by the people, as they past along Into the Senate; or, as to and fro, From place to place, on their affairs they go. Moreover, when that they had laid aside Their Senate robes, about their necks I spi'd A golden Wreath, which thereat pendent had A Tablet, whereon was enamelled, The British Isles, within the Ocean plac't; And with a Verge of curled waves embrac't: Which was bestown upon them for a badge of honor, and likewise to priviledge Their persons, wheresoe're they were unknown; That due respect might ev'ry where be shown, And no affronts receiv'd. These badges were From man to man, (and still from year to year) Resign'd to their Successors, to be born By those whom their Electors should return. Much more I saw, which should I here relate, Would yet appear, things worthy laughing at; (As these declar'd, already do to some) But, when the daies of their admittance come, (Which I believe draw neer) it will be found That these Previsions had some likely ground; And that the heart, from whence all this did flow Meant well to you, though these things prove not so. Hear me with patience, but a few words more, And, to their freedome, I'le your ears restore. As country folks, to keep out Witches, do Within the threshold, nail a horses shoe, So did I, at the fore-door of this piece, Insert a charm, to keep out prejudice: And, now, if some way els, it in be brought, That, at the Back-door, I may thrust it out, I'le fix a Si quis, (or it may be mo) Upon the Postern Gate, before I go. If any think the posture we are in Will still as prosperous be, as it hath been, Or, that GOD will this Nation still deliver By miracles, although we shall persever, In high presumptions, and supreme neglect Of that compliance, which he doth expect; They greatly are deceiv'd: For, know, the end Of most things, on contingence doth depend. We of this Nation, having walk'd upon The Pythagorean Y or, Ypsilon Are come unto the fork thereof, this day, Where lies before our face a double way, The one of them directeth us unto Prosperity; the other to our woe: On this hand, Bliss, on that hand, Curses lie; Proceed this way, and live; go that, and die. Ev'n Davids temp'rall Kingdom, (though there had Large promises, concerning it, been made) Was on his heirs intail'd, for their fruition, Not absolutely, but upon condition; Which, being broken; all th'externall power And glory of it vanisht; so shall our. Moreover, if that any shall believe Our hazards are far less then I conceive; Let them not trust to such a dream as that, Lest they discover, when it is too late, The dangers threatning us: For, I have been Inform'd aright, what perills we are in. And, whereas, of those things which passed by From time to time, I sought to satisfie My private knowledge only, (that I might Assured be I had observ'd aright) If I had thereby gathe'rd proofs, to show To other men, the truth of what I know, I should of such things demonstration give, As few suspect, and fewer would believe: And you would see, that we are in a course Like his, who in a dark night rode his horse O're Chepstow bridge, upon a single board, When lowd to him, the dreadfull waters roar'd, (Beneath the broken arch) and seem'd to say, Oh fool! take heed, ther's danger in the way. And some, perhaps, if they assured were What hazzards they have past, would die through fear, As it is said he did, when he had sight, Next morn, of what he scaped over-night. We think perhaps, we all this while have been Upon as plain firm ground as Richmond-green, Or in a Course, wherein as safe we run As on the race at Bansted-downs at noon; When we are rather dancing o're the tops Of tottering pinacles, on rotten ropes, Where, but that we by providence are kept, We down had fell, at every stride we stept. Yet, for the most part, every losse and streight Which we are in, makes us but lay more weight Upon the weak; and each Deliverance Doth but increase our pride and arrogance, As if we were resolved, without heed Of judgments, or of mercies, to proceed, Untill confusion should compell us to What we might orderly, and timely do. Lastly, if any shall be pleas'd to say, Or dream (as peradventure many may) That, with affairs I intermeddle here Which pertinent to my Superiors are, And not to me: To all these be it known, The businesse which I treat of is mine own. I claim, in this Republike, with the best, A share, proportion'd to my interest; And freedome, boldly to expresse my mind As often as I just occasion find. The common liberty, and common peace Are truly mine, and no mans, more, or less: I fought for't, and I pay for't, thrice my share, According to the part, which many beare. My Countries wrong is mine; her grief my sorrow, And therefore they that wound her thrust me thorow. They, who her wealth or honor fool away, Fool me, when in that kind the fools they play: And, therefore they, who thereto Traytors be, Are therein also Traytors unto me; And no man can without apparent wrong Restraint impose upon my pen, or tongue, In pleading of her cause; nor will I fear To act my own work in my proper sphere. For, though I have not power to make a Law, Or raise an Armie, which can keep in awe Her private enemies, and open foes; Yet, I have charms equivalent to those, In some respects; which operate unseen Those ends, whereto they have intended been; And will have due effects, in their despight Who seek to trample on the common Right. In this assurance, here I'le add a close, To this, and leave th'event to GOD'S dispose; Who, if we shall neglect (a few weeks more) Good counsell, as we have done heretofore, Will break down that, which might preserv'd have bin, And, on another Base his work begin. NOV. 30. FINIS. WESTROW REVIVED. A Funerall Poem without Fiction. Composed by Geo: Wither Esq. That GOD may be glorified in his Saints; That the memory of Thomas Westrow Esq; may be preserved, and that others by his exemplary Life and Death may be drawn to imitation of his Vertues. Blest are the Dead who dye in CHRIST; For, from their Labours they do rest; And, whether they do live or dye, His Saints are precious in his eye. To the READER. Reader, peruse this thorow: For, to Thee It most pertains, though WESTROW named be; And, gives (as by the way) some short hints, there, To what Intents, He, chiefly doth appear, And whereof, if good heed shall not be took Somwhat, ere long, more fully will be spoke. Both Moses, and the Prophets, many a day Have spoken; and a Greater one then they. Hear them: For when GOD sendeth by the DEAD, His Messages will come with much more Dread Then Comfort; and few men, with good effect, Shall hear these, the former do neglect. Be wise, or else; But, Ile, now say no more, The Feet of messengers are at the door. WESTROVV REVIVED. The first CANTO. The Authors musings here are shown The Night, ere ought, to him was known Of Westrowes death; whereof, the Morrow Assur'd him, to his greater sorrow; Then, that which he hath more to say, Is put off, to another day. Twas midnight; and, I had my self undrest, In hope, the nights remainder, for my rest Had been allowd; and, in that hope, all those Distractings, which my Minde might discompose Quite threw aside, and hastned to the place, Where, that refreshment, offer'd an embrace. But, in sleeps posture, ere I down was laid, A Thought within my heart, start up, and said, Westrowe, thy best, and most deserving Friend, Lies feeble, and approaching to his end, By thee unvisited (though two days, now Are past, since of his weakness thou didst know) How, canst thou answer, such a grosse neglecting, Of one, so well, so truly thee affecting? A second Thought thus answer'd thereunto, (To make amends) to morrow I will go In hope (since I, for this neglect am griev'd) A just excuse, will kindly be receiv'd; And, that love reall, shall not through defect That's accidental, suffer by suspect. To morrow, said a third thought, comes too late; His Lifes Commission, is quite out of date; And, that, which might have been enjoy'd to day, Is, by procrastination, lost for aye. Thou, too too long, thy purpose hast forbore, And, never now, shalt hear, or see him more. Yet, be not grieved, that it happens thus, For, he is safe: And, as good Lazarus Lost nothing, by a sickness unto death, Save only that suspention of his breath For some few days, which did a means provide, Whereby, both GOD, and he, were glorifide In greater measure; so, it may, be thou, Shalt hereby, have occasions offered, now, Of that, whereby, hereafter may be made Advantages, which could not else be had. Advantages! cride out, another Thought, Alas! what good effect can forth be brought By such an Accident, if I shall hear That, to be true, which yet, is but my fear? How can my pretermission ought produce Of any future comfortable use? Or, to what likely profitable end, Can such a comfortles privation tend? In Fancies Tennescourt, thus, to and fro My Thoughts were tost, and plaid at hazzard so, That very much distemper'd I became, With that unlook'd for, and unpleasing game. Their silent Dialogue made such impressions Upon my heart, and so inhanc'd my passion That, all the night ensuing they did keep My mind on him, and bard mine eyes from sleep. I, likewise, have so frequently perceiv'd My souls presagings true, that I beleev'd This sad surmize; and thereon did proceed To muse, as if he had been dead indeed And buried too. From whence, broak in upon me, Such apprehensions of the Favours done me, And of his kindnesses in my oppressions, That, they exacted from me those confessions Which in the following pages wil ensue To give, what to his memory is due. Dear GOD! if humane mercy so indears So sweet, so pretious, if that Love appears (And so obliging) which enjoy'd may be By Creatures! what is that, which flows from thee? If, little sparklings, may beget a flame, What may be thought of that, from whence they came? And, why from him should not my soul ascend To clasp thy love, oh my Eternal Friend! Who wert, and art, and wilt continue so, When all the World shall into nothing go! Some will at first, perhaps, with prejudice Peruse, what in this Poeme I expresse, On this Occasion; judging, that, hereby I, somewhat would, beyond the verity, Insinuate; to make small things, appear More in the show, than they in substance are. But they shall see at last, that, I pursue My Theame no farther than I make it true: And, bear me witnes, ere this hath an end, That, I have done but what becomes a Friend: That, real cause, occasion'd my unrest: And, that, of him, my thoughts are here exprest, Without hyperbo es; without devising Or adding, what the World calls Poetizing: And, that, I rather put upon the score Lesse, then I ow his memory, then more. But, to the matter: being full of grief, By what my fear had rais'd up to belief, To say, within myself, I thus began; Westrowe, that noble single hearted man, Whom GOD, had in a time of need bestown To be my friend, is now no more his own. Alas! nor mine: Westrowe, that heretofore, Was, to the Widdow, Fatherless, and poor, A Husband, Friend, and Father, them to feed, To cloath and harbor, in the time of need. Westrowe, GODS faithfull Almner; he, from whom No needy soul, who for relief did come, Went empty (if his needines requir'd, Undoubtedly, the succor he deserv'd) And, then, as GOD doth, he did alms bestow Upon the good, and bad, on friend, and Foe. Yea, and when none did ask, what he could grant, Sought where to find out those, who stood in want: And, often, was directed unto them, By Providence, in acceptable time. That Westrowe, now, hath left us to bemoan Our losses. For thereby, he can have none. Nor meant us any: But, is gone away That, our contentment, he make perfect may By his well-being, in a safe possessing, His portion, in an everlasting Blessing: And, that, we may look off, from him, to heed His Love, from whom, all mercies do proceed. Westrowe is gone, and we remaining have No more of him, but what is in his Grave: There, now, he resteth, and exchanged hath Life mortifide, for an inlivening death. And, him I do behold in contemplation, So represented, by transfiguration, As having laid that earthly vail aside (Which from the World, his better parts did hide) That, I will now disclose them; therefore, stay And, know him Reader, ere thou go away. Nor few, nor mean Advantages he had Relating to this life, But, these were made Of small account, with him; and, used so, As if with them, he little had to do, Except, for others sakes: For, he denide Himself, to all things, but, Christ crucifide; And, in respect of him, plac'd those among Such despicable things, as drosse and dung; Ile therefore, let them pass, to be forgot; And, will not mention, what he prized not. He, living, walk'd upright, in crooked ways, And, chose the best part, in the worst of days. He, dying, cheerfully, himself denide, That (being thereby wholly nudifide From all that was his own), he might be clothd, With what he lov'd, instead of what he lothd, And, he that can throw off, such Rags as these, Shall find himself, exceedingly at ease. How, can I know this, some, perhaps, may say, If he be dead, and I now far away: Thus; when I saw him last, I, saw him then Himself undressing, from that bane of men Self-love, and selfness; and I know, he never Would fall from his intention, and endevour, Till that were done. For, I was always neer him, In spirit, though, I did not see, nor hear him. We did communicate (when not by quill, Or with our tongues) in spirit, and in will As Angels do: yea, many times, when we In words and terms, appear'd to disagree, (Because of that defect which is in those) Ev'n then, in will, and spirit, we did close: And, they whom such experiments acquaints With that communion which belongs to Saints Do know, that men may credibly aver, Sometimes, what they did neither see, nor hear: And, worthy my regard it doth not seem, What, others, of this mistery shall deem. This confidence of Him, is but the same Which he exprest of me, when last I came To visit him; at which time, I receiv'd Assurance, of what is of him beleev'd: For, these, the last words were, vvhich from his tongue, I heard; and, they, from this occasion sprung. I told him, that I might be faulty judg'd, (Considering how to him I was oblig'd) That, nor by conversation, nor by pen, I, lately had with him, (like other men) My thoughts communicated, but persu'd My own Affairs, as if to be renu'd, Our Friendship, needed not those complements VVhich discontinance of respect prevents. To such effect I spake; whereto, he gave This answer (which I oft repeated have VVith much contentment;) trouble not thy self, VVith needless things, we are now past the shelf, That ship-wracks friendship. That, which seems neglect To others; and begets a dis-respect, Secures you more to me, then if you had Left your affairs at hazzard; visits made; And added to your frequent visitations, Acknowledgements of Debts, and Obligations As others do: It would not give me more Assurance of you, than I had before. For, my own heart, hath so informed me, Of what you are; and what you shall be VVith an assurance, so undubitable, (And everlastingly irrevocable) That, whatsoever shall of you be told, (Though we each other never more behold Nor line comes from you) I, shall live, and dye, More confident, of your sincerity Then, if it were expressed every day, By all that you, or other men could say. These words (though mine) give, really, the sence, Wherein, he did express his confidence: In this sence, his last words to me he spoke; And, so, my everlasting leave I took. I think, it may inferred be, from hence, Things may be known, beyond the reach of sence, Without corporall presence; and that we Of some things, though but part of them we see, May know the rest: He, that doth see me go, And hear me speak, may, without question, know That, I have heart, and lungs; although his eye Ne'r saw them, or the place in which they lye: And, he, that knows but what he hears, and sees, Is from a beast removed so few degrees, That, I shall mention unto him, in vain What to the Saints communion doth pertain. Only to those I, therefore will proceed, To speak, who can beleeve, as well read: To be, he rather labor'd, then to seem; And, sought his honor in self-disesteem. He wanted not repute, of being good, Save, where his meaning was misunderstood; Which seldom hapned, but where prepossession Gain'd entrance, by a mis begot suspition, And what he suffered by it, did produce, Effects, which were to him of some good use: And such as gave sometimes occasions, too, Of that, which good to other men will do. Such, as did know him well, knew none to be A truer Friend, or better man then he. He, by youths frailties, learned to improve In riper years, th'increase of Faith, and Love; And, by his life, exemplified that, Of which the Formalist, doth only prate. His Charity, was large; yet, what he did As much as might be, he from others hid. For, often, his misdoings, he would tell, But, seldom mention, wherein, he did well. He took more comfort, in a needfull giving, Then pleasure, in large benefits receiving. And (liking not their thrift, who do defer Almsdeeds, until their treasures useless are Unto themselves) he did, by timely giving, Forgiving, and a seasonable relieving, Shew, he beleev'd, that, thereby leave he shall, More to his childe, then if he left him all. And, that, he fear'd, should he not fructifie, (When, in his hungry members, Christ, pass'd by) Till, that which may be call'd his own time, came, He, and the cursed figtree, were the same. He, in his judgment, joyned not in one, With some good men: But, disagreed with none So far, as to infringe the band of peace; Or, hinder Christian charities increase: Because, he knew, the wisest, here belowe, Know but in part, the things they ought to know: And, that, to clear his sight, GOD, now and then, Did leave a darkness upon other men; Yea, and sometimes a frowardness, to prove And exercise, his patience, and his love. The Christian liberty, he did profess, Without allowing of licentiousness. He, labour'd, that, the Conscience might be free, From force, (yea though depravd it seem'd to be) Because, he saw more hypocrites thereby Then Converts made; and, that hypocrisie Is worse then error; For, it seldom burns, For Conscience; and, to GOD, as rarely turns. Beeause likewise, he was not without fears, That, some, who burn'd in zeal, to weed out tares, Might purposely, or causually, instead Of that which they pretended forth to weed, Either pluck up the wheat, or do it hurt, By careless treading it, into the durt. For, hardly, can distinguishment be made Twixt Ray, and Wheat, when they are in the blade. Moreover, since the owner of the Corn, Commanded, that such weeds should be forborn Till Harvest, to assent, he was afraid, That, this Commandment should be disobaid, Lest, to himself, he might contract the guilt Of blood, that may be innocently spilt. And, from this tendernes, some took offence, Not justly given, or arising thence. If, he sometimes, did put himself to trouble, By vainly building, with wood, straw, or stubble, (As all men do) which quite away consumes To nothing, when the fiery tryall comes; The losse was his, which only did redound To losse, of what, was better lost, then found. He was but man; and man at best, is light, And must have grains allow'd to make him weight. As he had fallings, and his humane failings, So he had also risings, and prevailings; And all GODS Saints have lesse advantag'd been, By their own righteousnes, then by their sin: For, both must be disclaim'd, and they brook worst, And find it hardest, to renounce the first. He, by stil cleaving to the true foundation, (And gratious Author of our preservation) Found himself safe, when all those works were gone, Which he had vainly builded thereupon. And was well pleas'd to see that turn'd to smoke, Wherein, he, formerly had pleasure took. Which, were it heeded well, would (sans all doubt) Conclude those Quarrels, which arise about Our superstructures, and must be denide As useles, when by fire they shall be tride. To truth essentiall, he did firm adhear Although sometimes, in termes, he did appear To leave it: And, when thither he retired, Where, he in quiet privacy, expired; His mind, he so compos'd, did so confute All self-mistakings, by a self-dispute; And, so examined, and so repented, All, whereto by mistakes he had assented, Unwarrantably (whether, it related To ought which had been publickly debated, Or privately, For Church, or Common-weal. For GOD or men.) And, there, so setled all His Interests; that with a quiet mind, He did enjoy the peace, he sought to find; And, unto GOD, a resignation made, Of will, opinions, and of all he had: Even of his selfnes; and therein, found more Enjoyment, then, in all the world before. His body, was consumed, by the zeal He bore to GODS house, and this common-weal, (And, by foreseeing, that he might outlive, The honour of that Representative (Of which he was a Member, For, when he And I, our thoughts confer'd, we might foresee, That, in a shott time (as my muse foretold, Some moneths before it came) that happen would Which now is come to passe, although those few, Who to the Publike Interest were true, Had neither counsel, nor endeavour spar'd, To help keep off the mischief that was fear'd, Ere, therefore, actually it did ensue. Tir'de out, with vain endeav'rings, he withdrew. A place for his retirement he had chose, Near to the Banks of Thame, where backward flows, The Tide at highest, up against the stream; That, he might neither be too far from them, To whom he had Relations, nor too nigh To such as might disturb his privacy. There, what he could not other wayes promote, He sought to further by a zealous Vote. There, private prayers, offered he at home, That, GOD himself would (for the time to come) Assume the Work, and call in those thereto Who, might accomplish, what they could not do. The World, thus left He er'e it him forsook: Against the Flesh, the Spirits part he took; And by their combatings, attain'd to have A Resurrection, er'e he had a Grave. But, lo, their long fought Battel now is past, The Spirit triumphs, and the flesh, at last By yeelding to be conquered, hath won, More, then by being victor, it had done; And now is lodg'd, in her withdrawing-room, To rest, untill the triumph-day shall come. There, from its labors, let it therefore, cease; There, let it lye in hope, and rest in peace, Till, to a better life, that Flesh, and we, Rais'd by a second Resurrection be. There to appear, where we shall fully know What is but darkly, apprehended now: Where, we shall see the root of all those things, Whence flow our needless bitter Quarrellings; And, where, accordingly we shall receive, To what we acted, or, as we beleeve. Oh! come LORD JESUS come, and fetch us thither; Gather thy Saints, and chosen-ones together; And, mean time, in that Saint be glorifi'd For whose commemoration I provide. By thine, and their examples, who do follow Their steps, oh! so inform us, how to hallow Our hearts, so cleanse our hands, and guide our feet, That, they now gone before, and we may meet. Thou, that art both our life, and way thereto; That open door, through which we are to go: A Fountain alwayes flowing, to refresh The thirsting Spirit, and the fainting Flesh; Supply unto us, by thy Holy Ghost, What, by our selves, and others, we have lost. O thou! who (being GOD'S eternal Son,) To free us, from a dungeon, leftst a Throne, And, underneath his heavy wrath didst lye Till thou crid'st out Lamasabaklhani. To Heav'nly joyes, convert our earthly greef; Decrease our doubtings, and increase Beleef; Our carnal love, improve to love divine, Till our Affections loose themselves in thine? Oh! let that Love, from whence all beings flow, Which made all things above, and all below: Whose Wisdom, did first set them in their way, Whose Providence, preserv'd them to this day, And shall hereafter, govern and dispose, That which keeps Order, and that, which misgoes, Oh! hasten to perfection! hasten on, The work intended, ere the world begun; And, let that Glory, which produce it shall, Be his (and his alone) that's All in All. Thus, mused I, or, much (if not the same,) To this effect, before the morning came. These contemplations, ere I knew him dead, By thinking on my Friend, conceiv'd I had, Which afterward, in words, thus, up I drest; To leave it thereby, vocally exprest, What penance, I was put to, for omitting A duty, my obligements well befitting Then, as the dawning Light began to creep About my Chamber, I fell fast asleep. Next day, (no longer meaning to defer A Visit, but till means prepared were) I, meeting with a Friend of his and mine, Informed him, what, I did predivine; What I had suffered, what, I have done, With what, I had that day resolv'd upon; And, to prevent it, was assur'd by him, That, my Presagings, were no idle dream; For, he was dead indeed, and on the morrow To be interr'd; which did renew my sorrow, And, reingage me, further to pursue What, to his pious Memory is due. For, there is much behind, as yet unsaid; Which, being truly known, and duly weighd, Will add a fairer lustre to his Fame; Not without some reflectings, to my shame, For, leaving him, without a Valediction, Who was so true a Friend in my affliction. Assoon therefore, as I have gotten leisure, What's yet remaining, forth in Words, to measure Expect it; and in pawn thereof, (till I, Shall to your view expose it) let this lye; With this ensuing Epitaph, till He Shall honour'd, by a better musing be. The EPITAPH. His GRAVE (though he desired none With Name, or Title thereupon) Was made below this Marble stone? And, here, interred, now, He lies, To wait CHRISTS coming in the Skies, At whose approach the DEAD shall rise. Yet, seek not here, among the DEAD, (On stones, or brass, or sheets of Lead) What, to his honour may be read: But, if you more of him, would hear, Peruse the sheets, whose Forefronts bear His NAME inscribed; and read him, there, For though that MONUMENT be built Without cost, graving, paint, or guilt, It shall remain, when this is spilt: Yea, though it hath but paper wings, It shall out last, those lasting things, Which, make up Monuments for KINGS. CANTO the second. After a due preoccupation, It offers to commemoration, Particulars: Insists upon A rarely memorable one. Illustrating a matchles friend; And, so, this Canto hath an end. The foll'wing evening, after I had heard That verifide, whereof I was afeard The night before, I, then afresh inspir'd, To give my Musings utterance, retir'd: And, that no interruptions I might find, Put all my own concernments, out of mind: For, he, that honestly one work, would do, Must not, the same time, be imploy'd on two. But, on the paper, ere I fixt my pen, Such things, as possibly by other men Might be objected, question'd, or alleadg'd, To hinder that, wherein I was ingag'd, Rush'd in upon me; and, delaies, had wrought, Had I not on a sudden kickt them out; And given some of them, (ere they would go;) A reasonable civell answer too. Among the rest, One (who scarce went away Well satisfide with ought that I could say) Thus question'd me: Art thou become so vain, To think, by charmes, and words to raise again The dead to life; or, to preserve the Name Of friends deceased, by surviving Fame, Among this Generation, wherein none Or few, regard what shall be said, or done, To that effect? Canst thou have hope to bring By poesie (which an unhallowed thing, Is now accounted) any due respect To him, whose memory thou dost affect? Or, think that thou maist dignifie his Herse, By such a despicable thing, as verse? Canst thou hope this, when he that versifies, Seems but a coyner, of facetious Lies? When lovers of the muses, are so scanty, That, there are hardly two, in five times twenty, Who, if thy Poem serious be, will heed it; Or, (if they will) that have the wit to read it, More gracefully, then if an Asse should play Upon a Harp, or to the Viol bray? For, neither heeding accents, points, or time, They, only make a clinking on the Rime. More harshly grating on juditious ears, Then scraping trenchers, which none gladly hears? And, what, of all thy musings, have th'effects Been hitherto, but troubles, and neglects? This being urg'd, I, thereto made reply Thus, in my self: Admit all this, quoth I: Mo wiseman fears to do, what should be done Through dread of that which may mis-fall thereon: Nor, so much cares, what may thereof be thought, As to be always doing, as he ought. It is the Muses duty, to be there Most active, where, most Difficulties are; And, most couragiously, there to advance Their Standards, where appears most Ignorance; That to succeeding Ages they may leave Those things, which present times, will not receive. It is a portion, whereto they were born To be exposed to contempt and scorn; And, tis their honour, to have wisely dar'd Just things, for which, the world gives no reward. Though Poets are despis'd, and, will yet more Contemned be, (and thrust behind the doore) As Ignorance gets ground; and, as the Base Shall rise, to sit in honourable place; There was a time, when Princes did contend In Poetry, and Poets to befriend; And, when the one shall consecrate his Muse, True Piety, and Virtue to infuse; And, men in power, by Righteousness maintain Their dignity, it shall be so again. The Muses, in times past, so awfull were That, they made Kings to fawn, and Tyrants fear. The Vulgar, they made Hero's; Hero's GODS: Drew Trees and Beasts, out of the salvage woods, To follow them: That is, they drew together Blockish and bruitish men (as rude as either Wild Plants, or Beasts, and them allur'd unto What reasonable creatures ought to do. Their Charm threw down the vicious to that hell, Where everlasting Infamy doth dwell. Rais'd up the well deservers from the Grave, The life of never dying fame to have, Yea, by their charms they have expel'd the devill, The furious, and the melancholy evill. And, not alone in former Generations, Among the learned, and most civill Nations, Had Poesie esteem, and good effects, In spight of envy, malice, and neglects. But, also, here, and lately some have lived Who, by their musings, honour have received. And been enabled, by their inspirations, To vindicate the Muses reputations. Yea, (in his measure) ev'n the barbarous Bard, Is of his, people, so belov'd, or fear'd; That, whom so'ere he pleases (by his rimes) He makes to be the minion of the times Within his Orb: And, they among us here, Who of this faculty the masters are (As to the language) can th'affections raise, And move the Readers passions various wayes, By their composures; though they do abuse His gift, who did that faculty infuse; As I myself have done, till he that gave it, Inform'd me better, to what end I have it. Then, why, with confidency may not I, Hope by the help of sacred poesie, So to embalm my Friend, by that perfume (Which fluently will by extraction come From his own vertues) that, a sweet breath'd fame, Disfused from the Orders of his Name, May draw some after him? and make them grow In love, with what doth from those Orders flow? And, thereby wooe them to an imitation Of him, and to a virtuous emulation? If David, in an fun'rall song preserved, The memory of that, which well deserved, In wicked Saul his foe; why may not I Seek to preserve a good mans memory? Why may not I with warranty commend The matchles love of my deceased Friend? Why may not I, as fully as I can Illustrate my beloved Jonathan? If, also, they, whose poesie affords Little save empty shews, and swelling words, Forc'd Metaphors, and frothy strains of wit, (Which on the fancy, ticklings do beget) Perused are with some effect that's good, And, are most pleasing, when least understood) Why may not I, be read by two, or three, With more advantage both to them, and me, Then, by a thousand, that are pleas'd with chaff, And, at my plain expressions jeer, and laugh. Why may not I, who have advantages, Of truth, and real merits (which helps, these Impostures had not) trophies hope to Rear That shall more lasting, and more fair appear Then such as they build, who composures fain Out of the durty notions of their brain, Or, from the vapours, that strong drink infuses, To dignifie the subject of their muses? Why may not I, this faculty imploy, To build up that, which others do destroy, By their abusing it? and, hope thereby So to repreeve it from that Obliquie, Which now it suffers, that, the best of men, May fall in love with poesie agen, And, not (as now they do) avert their eyes, As if asham'd of him that versifies? For, this is part, whereto my Poems tend Though, peradventure, I may miss my end. Let it not therefore, seem a prophanation Of Piety, unto this Generation, That, I adventure to redeem from blame The gift, by some employed to their shame; Since, it was first confer'd on each receiver, To raise up his own spirit, to the giver; And, then, to rouse up other mens affections, From carnal, popular, and vain dejections? Or that, to take my Reader, by the ear, I lay among my verses, here and there, Some hooks, with reason baited, which, sometime, Doth catch those who expected nought but rime. Nor, let this, (though a long preoccupation) Seem to be needless, or a vain digression; For, though it nothing adds, to my intents, The taking somewhat from them, it prevents; Which being done, ile now proceed to that Whereof, I purpose, further to relate. The subject of my Musings, being large Tis not within my graspings, to discharge What's thereto due; nor can it be confin'd, Within that compasse, which I have design'd, To tell you therefore, fully, what he was, Or, what he was not, would so far surpasse, This limit, that I only must expresse So much as may enable you to guesse At what remains untold, (though it be more Then here ensues, or hath been said before) And that I may, his inside lay to view Which I much better, then his outside knew. He was a Man, indowed with no lesse Of piety, then moral Righteousnes; And in the practising of both, so harty That, to the honest, and the godly party; (As call'd some are) he brought a supplement, Of reall worth, as well as Ornament; And aim'd at that reward, for which he ran, Not in the outward, but the inward-Man. From youths extravagancies, which (as he Hath oft confessed) he once thought to be Th'accomplishments of Gentry, without which They had in vain, been nobly born, or rich, From these (ev'n when he most indanger'd seem'd) He was by GODS especiall grace redeemd, (And brought off, by his providentiall hand) In seasonable time; even as a brand Snatchd from the fire. For, those commodious places, Prepared for the Muses, and the Graces, To coinhabite in, for education, Of youth in knowledge; and to keep this Nation From Barbarisme; Places, were become So fraught with Vices, and so perilsome, To soul and body, that, he was almost By ill examples, and lewd consorts, lost. For which a threatning vengeance hangeth over Those Seats, that will admit of no Remover Of what is menaced, till their Foundation Is rooted up, or saved by purgation. With what prevarications, he, was there Impoyson'd, and what principles they were Whereby he was indangerd, he to us Rendr'd as banefull, and ridiculous As words could make them; that, it might advance GOD'S grace vouchsafd, for his deliverance; And make them useful, unto those who heard What he was saved from, and what was fear'd. He was among the first, whose knowing zeal, Flamd out, to vindicate this common-weal From thraldom and oppression; thereto moved In conscience, and by principles approved. Not stirred up, by factious discontent, By rashness, want, or by malevolent Affections, or Designs, though not without Some counterpleas, in what he went about: For, in immergencies, which do relate To private conscience, and Affairs of State, The wisest man, his resolution brings To settlement, by various combatings. With him, thus far'd it: Then he to withstand The publick Fo, was honor'd with Command; Wherein, he ventur'd not his life alone, Without that profit, which by many a one Was aim'd at, and enjoy'd) but lent, and gave, And, wasted his Estate, to gard, and save The Publique Interest, without a prayre Exhibited, or temporall repair. Unsought for, (as I verily beleeve) He, afterward, the honor did receive Of supream trust; and, without cause of blame, According to his powre, discharg'd the same; The speaking, of no needfull truth forbearing; The powre, or presence, of no person fearing; Swaid not by hatred, neither by affection, To others; nor by that which had reflection Upon himself: But, freely said his mind, And conscience, as he did occasions find, In whatsoever matter was debated; Whether the thing propos'd, to GOD related, Or Common-wealth: if they who present were, (As I beleeve they did) the truth aver. And, if it so did happen that, sometime A tender pity, did prevail with him To plead for mercy, on behalf of some Made liable, by law unto the doom Of mulct, or death; the same he never prest Ought further, then the Publique Interest, With safety might allow it: And altho, He felt what other men are moov'd unto, By naturall Affections, he did still Conform his Judgment, and confine his will To Justice: And, this, rather doth increase His honour, then appear to make it less. And, though the Author, of the History Of Independents, hath injuriously (Among his other Leazings) added him Unto his lying Catalogue, of them Who, to the damage of the common-weal, By their Commands, Gifts, Offices, or spoil, Inriched, and aloft advanced be. From poore estates, and from a low degree; On him, that sticks not, but, reflects disgrace Apparently, upon that Liers face. For, to all those, who knew him, tis well known, That, with a large estate, by birth his own, He was indow'd. His Mother, yet, in Kent, Survives; a Lady, rarely eminent For Charity, and for a open doore, To such as are in misery, and poore. And, as he no way needed to inlarge His portion, or the Common-wealth to charge By such supplies, as others have desired (And often surreptitiously acquired) So, he was all his life, so far from craving, From wishing, from receiving, and from having Gift, place, or office, whereby he might add An augmentation, unto what he had, That, many whom the Common miseries Had begger'd, and whose publick services, And wants he saw neglected, he reliev'd Out of his own estate; and them repriev'd. From ruining, when helper they had none: Among which number, I my self, was one. And, that, which in this kind he lent or gave Was meant (as I beleeve) as well to save The Nations honour, as to do a deed Of simple Charity, in time of need: For, he preferr'd, the Publick Faith before His private Credit; and, did so abhor Their Avarice, who by a mutual Giving, Forgiving, and unseasonably relieving, Obstructed those performances, whereby Our deep Ingagements did neglected lye; That, to prevent it, he thought fit to scatter A portion of his bread upon the water Lest after private miseries, things worse Ensude; a nationall a public curse. Then, those large Legacies, which he in death To Charitable uses, did bequeath, (Consider'd, with his frequent bounteous giving, To such as were distrest whil'st he was living), Do make it, without question evident That he, both had enough, and such content With what he had, that, he upon his score Leaves nothing, that shall make his Children poor As they will do, who gave and took the bread, Wherewith the Fatherless should have been fed; And, have, with what their Servants blood did buy, Inlarg'd their Fields, and rais'd their houses high. But, I to little purpose thus go on To set my candle up before the Sun. They who had eyes to see it did behold, And knew as much before, as I have told. They, who by wilfulnes, dark-sighted be Set up what light we can, will never see. Now, some of you, (it may be) will suppose That my conjectures only, I disclose; Or that a knowledge of such things I sain Which to his private actings do pertain; Or, take them up on Trust. If, so, they think, So, let it be; I will not strive to sink A milstone in a shallow dish of water; Or seek to fill a viol, with such matter, As it admits not. Things, which must be known As well by others eyes, as by my own To make them certain; Ile no further mention, Without proof it seem a self invention That, which hath passed 'twixt us two alone; Those things, whereof my knowledg can by none Be doubted of) to mind I will recall; And, out of many, bring forth one for all; One, that shall set forth his deserving more Then all that I have mentioned before; (At lest according to that excellence Which suits a sensuall Intelligence) And, when with that expression I have done, Ile rather leave it to be thought upon, Then imitated; till self-love begins To loose that ground, which hitherto it wins. He, that is really a faithfull friend, Hath that, which doth within it comprehend All morall vertues; yea, and therewith too That charity, which from true Faith doth flow: For, such a person cannot be alone (In being so) a faithfull friend to ONE; But also to all others yea, extends His love to all GODS creatures, as his friends: And, doubtles, far above all those, to him, Who, for himself alone created them. This vertue therefore, doth on men confer The highest excellence they can have here; And, this rare vertue, (whereof, I, the Sound Had vainly heard before) in him, I found And thereof, such experiment will give That, you shall think of him, as I beleeve; And that in charity, he did out go Most men, who thereof, make the greatest show. That, you may know him; whom I knew so well, My means of knowing him, thus, first ile tell. The late intestine Wars, which with a flood, Of miseries, and with a sea of blood Ore flow'd these Nations, like a raging torrent (Which bears down all with an impetuous current), Brake in, ev'n at first rising, where then lay My chief Estate, and swept it all away; That, little thereof, which elsewhere was left, Was also, by th'Oppressors hand bereft, Save only some small part of my Estate, Consisting in rings, housholdstuff, and plate, Which being portable, preserved were, Or got together, by my future care. That, which expos'd my portion to the raging, Of my destroyers, was, a free ingaging Against the common foe: And, they, with whom I, for the Publique, did ingag'd become, Gave me the Publique Faith, that what I lost Should be repaired at the publique cost; And, that my Children, should be look'd upon With favour, and regard, when I was gone. By these incouragements I did pursue Their services, untill I neither knew Which way my present wants, might have supply, Or whereon, for the future to rely; And then, perforce, tetreated for recruit, To prosecute the Cause with fresh pursuit; Whereof I got some few effects in show, Which in the substance, prov'd not to be so. But rather brought, much greater mischiefs on me, Then all my open enemies had done me. For, some who had but fainedly pretended, To that, which I had seriously defended; Perceiving, me, preparing to disclose Their falshood, did become my open Foes; And through their complices (who by the hand Of Providence were weeded from the Land, Soon after) they so wrought, that Innocence And Faithfulness were judged an offence, Maugre apparent proofs and demonstrations Yet extant, by their own examinations: So, I was finde, confinde, and on my head That censure lay'd, which they had merited With seven fold more; and for my service past Into disgrace, was innocently cast, With nothing for subsistence, but, that poore House-furniture, which was within my doore. To add more burthen to those heavy weights, And drive me, thereby, into greater streights; My Friends, and my Acquaintance, then began To look upon me as a faulty man Who had deceiv'd their hope: so that, if they Who (though too few to help me) day by day Were at my trial, had not seen and heard Th'injustice done me, and the same declar'd; I had, in likelihood, ere this day, ended My life in want; disgrac'd, and unbefriended. For, as my Friends fell off, my Foes fell on With fresh pursute of what they had begun, And had not GOD in an unlook'd for houre Deprived them of their abused powre, They had destroy'd me quite. But, I, at last Escap'd; and they into the pit were cast. Mean while, they insolently domineer'd, Made songs and pamphlets on me; scoft and jeer'd, And had so villifide my Reputation To those who represented, then, this Nation, That, of four thousand pounds (to which account My due (prov'd fully) truly did amount) I could not get one penny for relief Of me, or mine, to mittigate our grief; Though, I had forced words into their ears, Which from by standers, oft, extracted tears; And, to compassion, might that Judg have wan Who neither feared GOD, nor car'd for man. To add yet further, to my great afflictions, GOD, with a sicknes, (spreading forth infections) Visits my house, and drove all those from thence, Who were some comfort in my indigence, That, being shut up, and excluded from All other helpers, I, to him might come. My children were all sick of that disease; Their single keeper, to her little ease, Was their sad Mother, whilst (as sad as she) I, sought, whereby they might supported be. And we, who served were, a while before With sixteen household servants, (sometimes more) Had then, but one Boy (who, sick also lay) And one poor woman, hired by the day. To pay, and feed those, I my plate had sold: My Wife, the Silver, and the lace of gold Which lately trim'd her Garmnts, ript away; To buy things needfull, for the present day: Her Ornaments she chang'd for bread, to eat: Then, sold the dishes, which did hold our meat: And last of all, our highest valued things, The pretious stones, the jewels, and the rings, To us, from honorable Persons sent, As tokens of respect (the same way went. And what was left, ill spar'd though it could be) To follow, for ought I then could see, Only this hope remain'd, that GOD had sent A sicknes, which by death, would wants prevent; Or, give us by his own hand, some repair: For, of his love, I, never shall despair, In this good hope, the Worlds neglect I scorn'd, And my petitions, into prayers turn'd, Directed unto him; who only knew My wants, and what was likely to ensue. But, he likewise, to answer me delaid; And for a while seem'd deaf to what I pray'd: Yet knowing not, what els remain'd to do, Or whether, or to whom, for help to go; Nor caring (if GOD left me) for supplies From other hands; I still renew'd my cries To him alone, and suddenly was cheer'd With somewhat, which to sence no where appear'd. And, as a Lover, thinking (in a dream) He hears his best Beloued calling him, Starts up in hast, and runneth out to meet The voice that cals him, ere he find his feet, And goes he knows not whether: So, with me It far'd, who (hoping not deceiv'd to be) Walk'd forth to see, if providence divine, Would bring to sight, or mind, some Friend of mine, Or his, from whom, I might that ayd receive Which to obtain from GOD, I did beleeve. And, mark his goodnes, Oh! all you that read it! So mark it, and with seriousnes so heed it That, (if I should forget it) you may be Remembrancers, hereafter unto me As I have been to you, in former time, Of what concerns this Nation, and this Clime, In this distresse, he, meets me, of whom here I am discoursing; And with pleasing chear Salutes me thus: Amid thy troubles now How is it with thee George? how farest thou? I, answer'd, SIR, I live, though I am poore; And, of my welfare, cannot say much more. Take heart said he; These dayes will have an end, And future times will better thee befriend. I sought thee at thy house, not with intent To trifle out an hour in complement But, lovingly brought thither, by a fear Lest more lay on thee, then thou well mighst bear. For, thy Petitions I, have heard, and seen, Of those transactions I have witnes been, Whereby thou, wert oppressed; and wherein Thy Country hath no lesse abused been. I, also publickly have heard debated Thy claims, and when they were allow'd, and stated; Saw what was justly, or unjustly done; And am assured GOD will look thereon Yea, I have so well heeded what thou hast Both lately and in former time exprest For GOD, and also for thy Countries sake, Whereof ensuing times will notice take That, I, myself to be obliged, thought To seek thy welfare; and from GOD have brought This token of his love: thus having said, Just twenty pounds into my hand he laid Of currant gold; whereat (as one amaz'd) On him with overflowing eyes I gaz'd; Not able, for the present, to afford The retribution of one thank full word. For, out of me, my heart away was gone To GOD, who made him do, what he had done. But, after recollection, SIR, said I, He that hath mov'd you, to this charity Will doubtlesly with interest repay What you have ministred to me this day; For, GOD himself alone, and none but he (Who knows in what distresses all men be) Could, you, to me so timely have directed Opprest with wants, and of all friends neglected: Or, so inlarg'd your heart, to bring relief Proportionable to my present grief. And, therefore, now il'e tell you, in what state You find me, that you may rejoyce thereat, By making you assur'd, that you have wrought A work, which in it self rewards hath brought That will requite it fully, though I liv'd, To let slip out of mind, what I receiv'd. Then, told him all, that is before exprest, And so much more as did infer the rest That might have follow'd, if GOD had not sent His charity, my ruine to prevent. The same impression, which his Act had made On me, my words on him, effected had; And, I am confident, that, had I given To him, the greatest gift, on this side Heav'n, He had not gone away, with more content Then, in his being made an instrument, Of such a timely mercy; and, that he So opportunely too, should meet with me. Now judg, if this be true, which I protest (Except the words, wherein it is exprest, And, some few circumstances, to supply The story, with a formal decency,) Is real truth; and no poetick strain, More adding, then the Essence did contain. Judg now, what, I, could honestly have lesse Hereof declar'd, then here I do expresse, Consid'ring what he was to me, till then; And, what I was to many other men. For, at their dore, for whom I had of late, My life adventur'd, lost my whole Estate; (And those expos'd, who were more dear to me Then life, and livelyhood, destroy'd to be) Ev'n at their dore, I, perishing was left Of credit, and Estate, at once bereft: To let me thereby know, and knowing, heed, That in the times of triall, and of need, Tis none of those Acquaintance, or those Friends, Which we our selves get, or whose love attends On our Prosperities; nor that, which we Think, obligations, upon them to be; Nor, publick Faith, nor Vows, nor Protestations, Either of Princes, Parliaments or Nations; Nor that which is, nor that, which we suppose A merit in Us, (or, for Virtue goes) Which, for helps, are to be relide upon, In great extremities; But, GOD, alone, And, that, in our Desertions, he, can make Not only, strangers, pity on us take; But, also, from the malice of our Foes, Raise us up help, salve mortall wounds, by blows; Cure us by sickness; make us rich, by losses; Give us true joy, in grief; Content, in Crosses; A life, by dying; and the first beginning Of justifying righteousness, by sinning: Yea, by the hiding (for a time) his Face, Assurances of everlasting grace: And to confirm my oft experiment Hereof; GOD, made this Friend an Instrument, To give me, of that mercy, one pledg more, Of which, he gave me many, heretofore. And yet, this is not all; for, ere those weights Which lay upon me; and the many streights, Then pressing me, removed were and past, (Which, some yeers, and some months to boot, did last) In times of like need, he continued on That work of mercy, thus by him began; Till, in this manner, he upon his score, Had set me, twenty hundred Crowns, and more, Without desiring Band, or Bill, or Note, To testifie the lending of one groat; Or urging me, betwixt our selves, to say I ow'd him ought, or that I would repay. Thus much for this time: For, tis cold, and late; And, that you may have time to ruminate On what is said; ile now break off, and borrow An hour or two, from my affairs to morrow, So much, of what remaineth, to recite As seemeth pertinent: And so, good night. The third CANTO. The Author, sheweth to what end, This Poem, was design'd, and pen'd. Next, he proceedeth to unfold What, is begun, and left untold Relating to his Friend, and Him; And gives you then, a breathing time. When I have spent the day, as oft I do, In wheeling round, and trudging to and fro, Through that meander, which do what I can Still further leads, (then when I first began) From my desired rest; and nothing leaves me, But new assurance, that the World deceives me; And yet still keeps me active, with a thought That, I am thereby doing what I ought; (Because, ev'n by perusing what is vain, A knowledge of some usefulness I gain, Which els could not be had) I take content In suffering what I labour to prevent; Permitting GOD, to order as he pleases, Me, and my something, and my nothing-nesses. And, in the night, when all to rest are gone; I muse on things more worthy thinking on, And, how, to others, and my self, I may Add somewhat, by our losses in the day. Nor are my watchings, in that stollen leisure, So painfull, as some think; but full of pleasure. Nor do my solitary Musings tend To that deceitfull, and unfruitfull end, As is perhaps thought, in those lucubrations, Wherein I take my loanly recreations; For, that, which me all night doth waking keep, Refresheth more my spirit, then my sleep. The subject, which this hour employes my pen, Makes my dead friend, to live with me agen: I, visit him, and oft he visits me With inter-courses, which no eyes can see. Within my Chamber; (none els being there) Me thinks, we two, as if alone we were Converse together, and he brings unto My memory, and thought, what I should do To order so my life, that when I dye, No living soul may be more glad as I. Sometime, with him I walk unto his grave, To view what kind of lodgings dead men have, And whether I can, see among them, there, Such dreadfull things, as flesh and blood doth fear. Yea, there, at midnight I have with him been, And every corner of the grave have seen, By Contemplation, (which sees many sights, Not to be view'd by ordinary lights) Yet there I did behold no greater dread, Then when I sleep most sweetly in my bed. Sometimes, he comes into my mind, and brings A multitude of temporary things To be by many thought of, who yet live, And were of that late Representative, Which from it honor, and, it being fell, Because they nor beleev'd, nor acted well. Of somethings too, that neerly will concern The wise, (till they are grown too wise to learn) He me remembers, by those conferences Which we oft had, when he enjoy'd his senses. And, whereupon, I oft did more then guesse At what was verifide in their successe: Yea, and sometimes, he makes me think upon The present Powre, and on what's yet undone, And should be done, and will be done, ere long, Unles, it grows, in self opinion strong, And sleights that counsel, which may save the State, As their Foregoers did, till 'twas too late. Sometime, the thought of him, translates me hence To Heav'n; where, what transcends intelligence And my expression, is to me disclos'd, By fractions, and by notions discompos'd; Which, nay the lesse a certainty declare Of some things, which for edifying are. Sometime again (for we can any whither Go safely) we descend to Hell together By contemplation; and there, take full views Of that which on Hypocrisie ensues; And, on each other failing, and offence, Perpetuating an Impenitence; And, thence, assume occasion to improve My thankfulnes, for that eternall love By whom I am secured from that place, Through his preventing, and assisting grace. By thinking upon him, who in his grave Lies thoughtles, of what thinkings I can have. Thus, I myself employ; and, by things past, The ordering of future things forecast; And, find a means whereby I do refresh My Spirit, whilst imprison'd in the Flesh. And wherefore, judg you, I my time thus spend? Is it to tell the World I had a Friend? How vain were that! since, I am not to know It cares not, whether I have Friends, or no. And, loves to hear of no respect that's shown To any, whom she takes not for her own. Is it to gain a gratiousnes with those Who, have, what he hath left at their dispose? That were to fall, ten thousand leagues below My spirit; and more base in me, would show Then it would do in them, to look upon With such a thought, what, here, by me is done, For, these my retributions, are as free From self-ends, as his bounty was to me, And, rather should be paid back, ten times double, Then I would loose my freedom for that buble. It is to please his near and dear relations, With large applauses, and commemorations Of him that's gone? Alas! that doth but keep Sorrows awake, which els would fall asleep, Doth but his knowledg in the flesh renew, Which keeps his better being, from their view; Adds brine to thirst, and to devouring fire Casts Oyl, which makes it but to flame the higher: And, if no better use, could hence be rais'd, It came to far lesse, then, not to be prais'd. Is it to honor him, that's in his Grave? That were the simplest thought the fool could have, What honor can they want, who tryumph there, Where fulnes of eternall glories are? What honor can he have from earthly things, Or glory, from a fame with paper wings, Which cannot make a flight for many miles, Beyond the compasse of these British Isles? Or, from an Epitaph, on stone or brasse, Read by a few in some obscured place? Or, how will it concern, or please him now, Who, to himself, would not, in life, allow Those attributes of honor, which appear'd Then due; nor, for an empty title car'd? And, would have been displeas'd, if he had known I, would on him, this trifle, have bestown, (Onely because, it to his honor tends) Although, therewith, compos'd to other ends? Beside (although it somwhat may concern His reputation) I am not to learn That these Blasts, for the most part, oftner rear A dust, to cloud it, then preserve it clear; Or, stirs up, envy, hate, or evill-will, To brawl, which else (it may be) had lain still. For, to the Flower that spreads the fairest blooms, The Cankerworm and Caterpiller comes. Moreover, they, who least deserving are May in this kind of honor have a share With best Desert; and buy, with what was theirs, A better Monument then this appears. Is it for some advantages design'd Unto my self? sure no; for none I find Hereby acquirable; nor had I brought My poverty to light, if I had sought Self-honour; seeing, there is nothing more Dishonourable thought, then to be poore. Well then; if it were neither so nor so, What is my purpose, in what now I do? Ev'n this, That, from the best man whom I knew Here living, I might set forth to your view A self-deniall, through the want of which The Common-wealth grows poore, and poore men rich. That, also, by him, in whose charity, GOD, did appear, in my necessity, Others may be provok'd, through his examples, To shew more love unto those living Temples, In which he dwelleth; and at least, forbear To ruine them, although they have no care Of their Repair: For, this is one of those Deficiencies, which multiplies our woes, And, through defect, whereof our former cost, And present hopes, will suddenly be lost, As they have been; unless we do with speed Put, what is yet but words, into a Deed; Not dreaming still, that, we from GOD can hide), What is by men, apparently espide: For, though we will not see, what we behold, Nor credit what we know true, being told, It shall, in spight of all our impudence, Let in a Fear, against which, no defence Can possibly be made; and, then, the doom We fear'd in secret, openly shall come. He, of this self-deniall was a Teacher, Yea, and as well a Pattern as a Preacher, Who, taught with power, such principles as these, And, not as do our Scribes and Pharisees. I wrote this partly likewise, in requital Of his rare kindness; and by his recitall Of what he was, to stir up imitation In all those who had any near relation Unto his fleshly being; and, thereby, To pay my debt to his posterity; And, that (if well improved) it might be Some retribution, for his love to me. But, (in the first place, though I name it last) This opportunity I have embrac'd, To keep still visible, before mine eyes, That Object, which the world doth most despise To look upon; ev'n that, disgracefull, poore, And lowe estate, in which I, heretofore Was friendless left; and, in how just a time, GOD, sent me full Deliverance, by him; One, from a Thousand chose, to signifie Thus much; that, (notwithstanding they whom, I, Remembred often; me remembred not) His everlasting love, was not forgot. Having now shewn the Reason of my Rime, I will return again to speak of him Who caused this discourse, which I am in; And, where I left off, there, I will begin. Before, the bounty, which from him did come, Amounted to the fore expressed sum, Ashamed in my self, to see how far He had ingag'd me, without taking care Of reimbursement; unto him I sent Unask, a true and full acknowledgment Of all I had received: But, to my hand, He back returned it, with this command That, to no Person, I a word should say Of what had past betwixt us, in that way. For, well I know, said he, both you, and I, Shall get but disadvantages thereby. The World, is full of envy, and malicious, Making to us, our best works most pernitious. They who in her affairs, are chiefly wise, And, view, our actions, with meer carnal eyes, Will judg me but a fool; and, think perchance, Your wit, hath wrought out of my ignorance Or easines, that, which is an effect Of GODS good providence, and my respect: Keep it in secret therefore; for, from thence, There can arise no mischief, or offence. These Reasons charm'd me; and, with much ado, I silence kept, because, he wil'd it so. Only, (some few dayes after he forbid This to be mention'd) I friendly chid By these ensuing Verses, which are next Inserted here, as not beside my Text. SIR, though, so friendly, you to me have been, That, to forget it, were a mortall sin, Yet, I am one, whom divers do suppose To make no difference, betwixt Friends, and Foes. In my reproovings; And, if that be true, My worthy noble Friend, then, have at You, For, you forget your self, and strive to clime To heights, so unfrequented at this time, That, I suppose, I am in conscience tide Your temper, and your practises to chide, Lest by soft-hearted kindnes, and compassion (with such like vertues, now grown out of fashion) It may deservedly be said, by some, One of these Sectaries you are become, (And, of these Hereticks thought worse then Turks) Who shew their true beleeving, by their works; And, seem to bring their simple custome hither, Of living well, and lovingly together. Fy! have you honor'd been to sit among The wisest of this Common-wealth so long? And where, the men, who do themselves suppose To be (at least) the wisest part of those, Can many dayes, weeks, moneths, yea many years, Hear Widdows out-cries, and see Orphans tears, Without the casting of one look aside On those, who by their path, stand Crucifide? And will you so degenerate from them Whose practices, are patterns for the time. To look on him, whom they have trampled on, And left, as to the world-ward, quite undone? Can you descend so low, to fix your eyes On those, whom men in honor do despise? Yea, in a manner, seek unto them, too, Who are distrest, (before they seek to you?) Wooe them to be releev'd, by your expence? (As if you suffer'd, by their indigence) And charge them, that they tell it unto none, As if a deed of darknes, you had done? Beleeve, it SIR, this is a novelty, Which doth betray you, so apparently That, were it known, your best Friends would not stick, To voice you, publickly, a Schismatick. Scarce parallel'd: For, you in this divide From all I know, in all the World beside, Excepting one or two; and you, and they Make up that little Congregation may, With whom CHRIST promis'd he would present be, Though it consisted but of two, or three: And which was promised, (for ought I hear) Though none of them, a Priest, or Prelate were. The circumstances heeded in your acts, Do very strangely aggravate the facts. Had it been only, in a humor done, Or, in a fit, but once, or twice alone (As works of charity, are, now and then, Performed, and repented of agen,) Or, had that charity, from you distil'd, But, drop by drop, or had it forth been fil'd By thimbles full, (as unto those we give, Our Aquavitæ, whom we faint perceive) Had it been so, or so, I should have thought So much thereof, as I in reason ought; (Though, with much more respect then yet I see, My publike services, will thought on be,) And would have striv'd, as far as I was able To make the gifts, and thanks, proportionable, As wise men do; or, some way complemented, And customary services presented, According to the fashion: But, the course, That you have took, Acknowledgments inforce Beyond all Presidents: For, Sir, you stretch Your noblenes so far beyond the reach Of my weak faculties, to retribute Acknowledgments, which therunto may suit; Yea, and so oft, so long, so gen'rously You have releeved my necessity; That, therewith overcharged, that I am fain, To break out of the rode, into a strain, Some way extravagantly to declare, As often in such straights as these we are Constrain'd to do; And, as once Peter did When through CHRISTS manhood, he the Godhead spid; And, when, he having fish'd all night for nought, And drew a whole ship lading at one draught, He cride out, LORD, go from me (get thee gone) For I confesse my self a sinfull one. As, is the Fruit, so, may the season be A token of the nature of the Tree: (As that which cometh by the Rivers side, And, whereby Righteous men are typiside Illustrates well,) I, therefore, in respect Ev'n of the time, may somewhat here object, To show, yet farther, how you rend from those Who have our earthly things, at their dispose. For, at such times of need, still, ayd you lent, As if by GOD himself, it had been sent, Who, only, knew my wants; and unto whom I, only shew them, when such great ones come: Because, in greatest wants, I do perceive Men readier to destroy, then to relieve. Such, is the state of many in distresse; Such, is the hate, of those, who do oppresse. The rightly timing of a benefit, Doth, very often, more then double it: And, though such charity, may, in these dayes, Return you little present gain, or praise, Yet, GOD observes it; and, as sure, as he, Will of a cup of Water heedfull be Bestow'd on him who doth assume the name, Of his Disciple, (although not the same) Your timely, and your large benevolence, Shall have a timely, and large recompence. Me, in due season, GOD not only shall Enable too, some way, to pay you all; But, add mean time, a blessing to defray That interest which he doth yet delay: And, in that place, where some of those (I fear) Who, me opprest, will tremble to appear, You, shall be welcomed, with come ye blessed, Who fed, and cloath'd me, when I was distressed. These things consider'd, this, which I begun, Pretending some reproof, intendeth none: But, rather, is, (that debts be not forgot) A memorandum only, or a note, Subscribed with my hand, for intimation, That, you, with me, shall have his obligation Whose word is pass'd already to restore Whatever shall be lent unto the poor: And, who, doth good to every one intend, Whose heart he moves, the needy to befriend. Yet, that, mean time, I may not failing be To pay as much in hand, as lies in me; Receive this Benediction. Whensoere The day of fiery tryall shall appear, To prove your Faith, and purge you quite from all Your selfnes: which ere long time will befall. Let, then, your Faith be strong, and GOD be seen A friend to you, as you to me have been: And let your charity before him stand, To manacle, and weaken every hand, That would oppress those, whom you leave behind: Let them GODS favour, in all troubles find: Be safe preserved, in all times, and places, By his free mercies, and preventing Graces; And let this prayer, stil, about GOD'S Throne Be fluttering, till he saith, so be it done. These Verses, for his large benevolence Were, for a long time, all his evidence. Nor would he more receive, though many a time Security was offer'd unto him. And, once, it was in words like these, denide: When first I your necessity supplide, My purpose was not, meerly to relieve Your present need; but, likewise, ayd to give That, by your own endeavour, (with my cost) You might recover that which you have lost. The State, hath no part satisfied, yet, Of your allow'd, and overlong due debt: And, till that shall be done, I will expect No payment, neither ought to that effect. But, his assistance having made me strong, That, to recover, which had been by wrong Detained from me, in a private hand; (And having somwhat more at my command) I thought my self oblig'd (as I was able) To render some returns proportionable To my Estate. So, he accepts, at last, Security for part, and lest the rest; (Of which, to him, I somewhat yearly brought) Without his asking, as expecting ought (By any thing expressed) untill that, Were pay'd me, which is owing by the State; Or, till the residue, I could repay, By some enablement another way. This, shews it is no frivolous occasion From whence this Poem springs; or, Obligation To be as inconsiderable, slighted Which me to this acknowledgment invited: But rather, in regard of GOD, and Man, An act, which ought, as fully as I can To be exprest; That, for it I might give The praise to GOD, and, men th'example have. For, by his charity, GOD'S love appears: I was, thereby, preserved many years From perishing: Thereby, likewise, together With that assistance, which I had from other Concurring helps, (which have the same way, been To me by GOD'S good providence, sent in,) I got to be possessor of the gate, Of those, who were mine enemies of late; And, thereby, also, partly to expresse To others, in their need, my thankfulness. Thereto, the Noble, and much Honored Bradshaw, and Dixwell, ayde contributed, Among some others, who are not forgot. Although their kindnes, I here mention not; Yea, GOD, for me, so likewise, did dispose The purpose, of my avaritious foes, That, doubly, it advantag'd me, and more Then all those loving friends had done before. Which, suddenly improoving my Estate Beyond, what I did hope, or aimed at; The World doth seem to think, and some do say, That, I, to thrive, have practised her way; And, on my conscience, would now love me too, If, truly, she beleev'd it had been so: For, nothing renders her, a Foe to me But, that she fears my words, and deeds agree. And, that, though baits, and snares for me are laid To serve her ends, I shall not be betraid. Now, having finished this little story, Which hath a neer relation to GOD'S glory As well as to the honour of my Friend, With some brief inferences, I will end. But, lest, these may detain you overlong, Here pause; and read them, in the following Song. The fourth CANTO. Of Christian love, the large extents; The sad, the bad, the mad events Of discord, here the Muse displaies; That Idol SELFNES open laies. Some other things to heed commends, And, then, with praise, and Prayer ends. What shall that Musing profit, which affords Nothing but bare Relations, or meer words? Or, what will things avail, that shall be read, Concerning those, who sleep among the dead If no advantages at all they give To benefit, or better those that live? Sure none; Lest, therefore, these may justly passe For tingling Cymbals, or for sounding Brasse, Some useful notes, or notions, ile discover On this occasion, ere I passe it over. And though I cannot talk, as others do, Ile preach my way; and, preach to purpose too. Of many things, which merit mention may, Wherein my Friend, hath pattern'd out the way Of walking, and of practise; three things, here, Shall be insisted on, as those that are Deserving speciall heed: Such, as (if we Well imitate) a true ALL HEAL shall be: End all Quarrels; Take off, from our eyes The blinding scales, and filmes of prejudice Which keeps us dark, and from a right perceiving, of truth, and, in a wilfull misbeleeving. An imitation thereof, would bring hither Outward, and inward peace; and knit together CHRISTS disunited members so, that love Would ripen knowledg; knowledg help improve A saving Faith; That Faith renew the Will; A will renewed, would GODS minde fulfill, And therewith so acquainted make us grow That, we should learn to Act, as well as know. The first of these is Love; love, not extending It self, to these, or those, but comprehending All things created, with an imitation Of CHRIST, by meekness in his conversation With Publicans, and sinners; and, with such As knew but little, and beleev'd not much. Such, was CHRISTS love; and (if I do not miss) According to man's measure, such was his. For, though, that vail of flesh which others wear, And, that, which clothed him, when he was here, Disguiz'd his inward man, and made him pass For one of those, who running of a Race Doth beat the air in vain; yet, they, whose eyes Observed him when he was neer the prize, Saw, he had usde the means, and chose the ground, Which best advantag'd him, and would be crown'd, When, many, at a loss themselves would find, Who, better dieted, and disciplin'd Were thought to be; For, none could know so well What best befitted him, as he might tell. Near to his latter end, he had attain'd Such love to all, and, therewith, so unfain'd A longing both to win, and to be won Unto the Truth, that, he was Fo to none So much, as to himself: and, by forbearing, By hopefulness, long-suffering, patient hearing, And meekness, without bitterness of spirit, True quietness of heart he did inherit Within himself; and waited, when GOD'S leisure Would of his grace, to others, fill the measure. My cognizance of him, perswades me so, And, whether he thus perfect were or no, It serves the turn, as well to let us see What you, and I, and every man should be. Yet, of this Christian temper I had proof, To make it forth, with evidence enough. For, though in fundamentals we agreed, Essentially (as by what did succed, Is manifest) yea, though we did accord In one GOD, in one CHRIST, one Faith, one word. One will, and hope; (as all true Christians do,) Yet, in some accidentall means thereto We disagree'd; yea, often, did dissent In some things, which 'twixt others made a rent. And, I was oft, so earnest in dispute, His tenents to disprove, and to confute, That, they who should have heard us, might have judg'd Not me to him, but him to me, oblig'd, And that like Paul and Barnabas, at least, A parting, would have followed our contest. Yet, though we both stood firm, to what we thought, Nor losse of love, nor breach 'twixt us, it wrought; But, rather, to each other kept us nearer, The firmer in our friendship, and the dearer: Because we both knew, that, one Judg we had, In whom Atonement, would, at last, be made: Because, we both intended, not that He, Or, I, might conquer, but, Truth victor be: And, this declareth his deserving, more Then all, that I have said of him before. For, what man els, but he, would not have thought My Obligations, should my soul have brought In bondage to his Judgment? or, at least Kept me from owning mine, by hot contest? Who els but he, would have continued on His love, and bounty, unto such a One. As thwarted his opinions? and, not rather Have made me scatter what he holp to gather? Converted former friendship, into hate, And, sought to ruine me, in my Estate? Which had with ease been done; since, at that time, My chief subsistance, was receiv'd from him. But, of his judgment, what er'e think I might I knew his love was firm; his heart upright; And, this beleef of no man, I could have Who gave his charity, to make a slave: Or, who from bondage did my flesh unbind To lay a greater Thraldom, on my mind. No, (though from servitude, he set me free) If he, thus cruel, should to others be. Nay, though a King, with me should share his Throne, And prize me, as his chief elected one, Were he a Tyrant over other men, I could not give him love, for love agen: Nay, further (be it spoke with reverence To him I speak of, and without offence) Could I believe that GOD, in whom I trust Were (though he lov'd me) cruel and unjust, I would not seek with him in Heav'n to dwell, But, rather, go, and live alone in Hell. For, he, that's with essential GOD delighted, And, thereunto by hearty love united; Should therewith feel to him, such vertue giv'n, As would translate the lowest Hell to Heav'n. I fear, I go too high in my expressions, Ile therefore stoop again, from these digressions To speak what's possible to be beleev'd Of those, by whom this cannot be receiv'd. And shew them, in my common strain, how far From Christian love, the greatest number are, Who most professe it; that, affect they may A far more excellent, and better way, If carnall lusts, will give them time to read it, And, their self-love, admit of Grace to heed it. It is not love, but cruelty in those, Who, would on others consciences impose Their Yoaks, or break the bands of loving kindnes, Because their friends have weaknesses, or blindnes: Nay, (which of cruelties appears the worst) Because, they would not be, from that divorst, Which is their comforts chief preservative; And, without which, none happily can live Here, or hereafter; And, when doing so, To these imposers, no true good can do. What is a friend for; or, what better are Those friends, then foes, who neither can forbear Nor help to bear, that Friends infirmities With meeknes, whom he hath been pleas'd to prize? But, beat the lame, because, they cannot run, Leave him that's blind, because he sees no Sun; And, separate from them, for that, which they Would willingly disclaim, and cast away If they were able; or, els, did not fear They, thereby, sinners against Conscience, were? Whereas, they rather should with these abide, To lead the lame; to be the blind-mans guide: And, with long-suffring, to instruct the other, Till he becomes a true beleeving Brother. Oh! how far off! how far! are such as those From imitating him, who lov'd his Foes? (And dide to save them?) who pursue with hate Their friends, for those concernments, which relate Unto themselves alone? How far are such From loving them, who have offended much? This temper at this time, is very rare, For gen'rally almost, we bite and tear, So barbarously, each others flesh, and fleeces, And rend CHRISTS Robes into so many peeces, That, we seem rather Woolves, and doggs, then sheep, Belonging to that Flock which he doth keep. Nor are they, only, Woolves in sheeps array, Who, thus their Woolvish nature do betray, But, ev'n on some of us, who of his Fold Are Members, this, distemper doth lay hold. Ev'n we forsooth, for whom our GOD hath done So much of late; we, we, who look upon Our selves at this time, as a People chose By speciall providence, to scourge his Foes; And, to be they, whom he first cals to bring Unto his Throne, our Everlasting King, Whose Banners LOVE; Ev'n we, have here of late, Instead thereof, advanc'd the Flagg of HATE To be our Standard; and, the same display With as much virulency as we may Against each other: Yea, against those, too, Who seek GOD'S face, as truly as we do. Some of us, so aloft, our selves do carry With hope of great atchievements temporary, That, we forget from whence we first ascended; Slight them, for whose sakes, we have been befriended; None loving, but our selves; and looking on All els, as if the Earth, for us alone, Had been created; and all others, born For objects of our hatred, or our scorn: And, leave them unrewarded, by whose hands The ground was won, on which our building stands. Some of us, on a spirituall account, To such an overweningnes do mount, As if, we only, were the men, to whom Belongs that Kingdom, which is yet to come; Or, as if Heav'n, for none els were ordain'd, But, those, who are among us entertain'd; Bound up to our Rules; marked, with our Prints; Or, qualifide with our distinguishments: And, so bewitch't are we, by our own Dreams, With that, which we have Preach'd upon those Theams, That, if we take not heed, twill bring about That mischief, which we purpose to keep out. For, we through want of love, are so devided, By having this way, or els that way, sided To raise what others build up, or, in striving To raise a Babell, of our own contriving; That, some perchance, may see the Dragons tail, Swing once more over us, ere we prevail. Yea, want of love, on all sides, so misteaches, Here, such Obstructions makes, and there, such breaches That, we are like to make our common Foe, An easie passage, where he could not go. Yet, tis not possible to make us wake From our vain Dreams, a safer course to take; Unles, GOD, shall, our Adderlike deaf ear, Pierce by some stranger charms, then, yet, we hear: For, they are thought to speak words most in season, Who speak most impudently, and least reason: In which besottednes, if he walk on Much longer, as too long time we have done, (Acting, as if we thought, to shew, our folly Would be an argument to prove us holy. And drive still furiously against each other, As if all shortly would be mad together,) They, will not much mistake therein, who shall This Isle, Great BEDLAM, now Great BRITAIN call. The other vertue, of my now dead Friend, Which to our imitation, Ile commend, Is, to be zealous, in the pulling down Of our great Idol, now, more famous grown, Then was Diana; and, ador'd by us, Much more then she was once, at Ephesus. That weak, that base, that despicable ELFE, Cal'd SELFNES, which, man sets up in himself; And, for whose services, and adoration, We from all things within the whole Creation, Make patterns to our selves: And, not of these Alone, make we fantastick images But, of things also, which had neither birth, Or being, on or underneath the earth; Neither within the water, ayr, or fire, Or any where, in lower place, or higher. This, is that God, which now is worship'd more, Then Baal, and all those Idols heretofore, Which did provoke to wrath. There, are our loves Most fixt. Thereto, our Temples, Altars, Groves Are consecrated; and, what els, beside Whereby, an Idol may be glorifide. Thereto, those Tithes, those Duties, those Oblations, Thanksgivings, Prayers, solemn Observations. All forms, and ceremonies, (whether taught By truth, or, superstitiously in brought;) Our Governments, our Parliaments, our Laws, Our Armies, our unjust, and righteous Cause; Our Conquests, all our wisdom, all our wealth; Our honor, beauty, with our youth, and health; Our righteousnes (if we in us, have any; Our wickednesses, (whereof we have many;) Ev'n Scriptures, Judgments, mercies, Sacraments, With what els, GOD ordains, or man invents, Are all, by some among us, now converted, (Or, rather, to speak properly, perverted) Some way to serve, as to advance the praise Of SELFNES, that great Idol of our dayes. And, some, who vote, and speak against it more Then many; more, then any, her adore. Most, who pretend, to serve the Common-weal, Do most intend, from thence to rob and steal Wherewith, to sacrifice before the shrine, Of that lou'd Idol; which doth glare, and shine, With jewels, gold, and those embellishments, Which should have been the publike Ornaments, They, from poor Orphans, and sad Widdows, tear Their Garments, for their pseudo-god to wear: Pluck from their hungry mouths, their bread and meat, For that devouring God of theirs to eat: And, then, for his drink-offerings, pour forth floods Of faithfull servants, Friends, and Childrens bloods. Most, who pretend true Justice to maintain, Do more contend, to wrong those who complain, Then how to right them; that thereby they may Make innocents, this cursed Idols pray: And, to their faithful friends, are most severe; Either, to make a shew, as if they were Impartiall: or, perhaps, thereby, to pay A good desert, the clean contrary way. Most, who pretend to charity, do give Either, in hope they, thereby shall receive Some benefit; or els in hope to raise A Monument, or Trophie of self praise: And few out of a tendernes of heart, Give, to releeve, or to reward desert. Most, who pretend to friendship, do but buy With complements, or some cheap courtesie, Their self advantages; and, to more charge, When they are put, it is but to inlarge Their selfnes, and, some way thereby, among Such other ends, to make their party strong. For, when unserviceable, these are grown, They cast them off, as Persons never known. Yea, when the times doth come, which truly shows Who is a Friends, they then become their Foes. Most, who pretend for GOD, that vertue fain For nought; with them, is godlines, but gain. They frequently, more bold with him do make, Then with all others; and from him dare take What ere they can, to sacrifice unto, This Idoll; and suppose no wrong they do. Yea, those pert Jewish women, who had given And, would give spice Cakes to the Queen of Heaven (And had befoold their Husbands to consent That, them they should, in GODS despight, present, Took not his Oyl, his pure Wheat, and his spices, To make, their wicked wilfull Sacrifices, With bolder impudence, then many a one Among us, for this to Idols use have done. A Spirit, being, GOD, in no need stands Either of Churches, Tithes, or Rents, or Lands, Or Forms, or any of those other things, Which, for GODS worship, our devotion brings: For, these will do his deity no good: But, selfnes, is a God of flesh, and blood, That will be highly pleas'd with those, oblations Which GOD Almighty, counts abominations, If not made use of, with all circumstances, Which, in a right way, piety advances. And, therefore, we do purpose (if we may) To take them, for this Idol, quite away. But peradventure, ere effect that finds We may be taken hence, or change our minds. This, is in every heart, the Antichrist, Which doth usurp CHRISTS Temples, and resist His raigning there. There, paramount is he (Though other Antichrists, there, also be) His chiefest opposite; and gives offence, More then his Foes, of greater eminence. The Devill, doth in the World, against him rant, As his chief Foe; In his Church militant, (At large) The man of sin; And this, or that Corruption in each individual State Or Congregation: But, this, hath alone In every single man, the supream Throne Of opposition; though, sometimes, appearing In one beloved sin, and sometimes wearing Another habit, as it best befits The place, or person, where, inthron'd it sits: And, though the Devill, Turk, and Pope, and all Whom, in their sphears, The Antichrist we call Should down be thrown; we shal rejoyce in vain If, in our hearts, this Antichrist still raign. This, is that Idol, which prolongs our woes: This, is that Idol, which, if ere we lose Our present hopes, is that, which will effect it: And, I do more then probably suspect it. This, is the last thing, my deceased friend, Declaim'd against, before his latter end, As likely to be that abomination, Which will occasion here, a desolation; If not destroy'd, or, at least, debased Within those Temples, wherein it is placed. This Idol, hath in every heart a shrine; Yea, (though I hate it) doth possesse in mine The inmost room; there, screwed in so fast, That, thence, I fear, it hardly will be cast Till all that Fabrick shall be broken down, Wherewith it is incorporated grown, It knows what now I think, what now I write, And sticks the closer to me, in despight Of all that I can think, or say, or do: Yea, and by means of this performance too, The more exalted in my heart will be, If, GOD himself, shall not deliver me. But, he will add sufficiency of Grace; For, I intend ev'n in that very place, Where fixt it stands, to sacrifise the Beast With all the trinkets of self Interest: Which, if I can do, while 'tis fixed there, Will better please, then if destroy'd it were. Another Virtue in my Friend, no less Deserving heed, was Conscientiousness In words and works; whereof, an imitation, Would bring much happiness unto this Nation. For while good Conscience, entertain we shall, It keeps a never-ending Festivall, Which gladdeth more the heart, then when we feast To entertain our best beloved Guest. If sleighted; it becomes our greatest Fo: If cherished; it such a Friend will grow, That, when all else forsake us, and abuse us; When they oppress, and causlesly accuse us; When opportunity the Devil wins, To muster up against us, all our sins; When, GOD perhaps, doth lay upon us too, A heavy hand: when Death (as it will do) Arresteth us, our countless debts to pay, And, to his dungeon carries us away; Ev'n then, when all our honors and our wealth, Our youth, our strength, our pleasures, and our health, Shrink from us; when, our best beloved Friends, Our wives and children, upon whom depends Our greatest earthly comforts, will forgo us; Lodg us among the dead, where none shall know us; And, leave us without succour, all alone, To give account for that which we have done: Then, will this Friend, if well we cherish her; (Yea, though she formerly abused were, If we be sorrowfull for our offence And reconciled by true penitence) Will go along with us unto the Grave; Remove all thence, whereof, we dread may have; Sleep there with us, whilest there we shall remain; Rise with us, when we shall arise again; And, make us there, with joyfulness appear Before that Judge, when other men shall fear: For, having in this life, the privileges, Of our Accusers, Witnesses, and Judges, (Which none else hath by our terrestriall Laws,) Before hand, she determineth our Cause. She, by the Law that's written in our hearts, Doth judg us; and no jot from that departs; So that no Soul, can justly counter-plead, An Ignorance; or stand in any need Of an Interpreter, or, witness brought, To testifie, of what, was good or nought: For, none, will she condemn for that offence, Whereof, he bringeth not an evidence Within himself, to clear, or to condemn, For that, which is objected unto them. And, whosoever to this judgment comes, Shall blame themselves, and justifie her dooms. Look therefore that you keep this Judg your friend, And that, by your fault, she who will pretend To be this Conscience, be not entertain'd Instead thereof: For, Conscience may be strain'd So far, and by accustomed refusing Good counsell; and by wilfully abusing Her just reproofs, till her away we chase And let an evil conscience take her place. And, what events, may afterward eusue, I leave it, to be thought upon, by you. How, we may know a Conscience rectifide; How, to preserve it, we may means provide; How to recover it again when lost; Time to compose a large discourse would cost. To sound the depths, I therefore will forbear, And onely add, for your example here, What, by occasion of my Friend, that's gone, I have, since his departure, mused on. Good Conscience, whereof high esteem be made Three Objects hath; to which there must be had A due respect, asunder, and together, Without neglecting, what belongs to either; Except in things, wherein the less is debter, To wave his due, for that, which is the greater. GOD is the first; our neighbours, or our brother (In some respects) the next; our selves the other; Whose welfare, in some cases, may before The second be preferr'd, and render'd more: Because, it is the Rule whereby to square, That love, which to our neighbours, we should bear. Our duties to all these, were in the heart First written; and renew'd again, in part, By common grace: But, sin hath so defaced That Table, and that writing so much rased, That, we must seek to make up that Record By what, GOD hath supplied in his Word; And, they, who would preserve the conscience fair And blameless, to that Glass, must oft repair; Which, (by that aid, which GOD to add will please) Shews us, our several duties, to all these. All they, whose Conscience is this way renew'd, Know what should be embrac'd, and what eschew'd. Such, will not of his honor, GOD, bereave, To save their Countrey; nor, their lives to save, Spoil or betray that; nor, themselves deprive Of ought, which they to serve these, did receive Through cowardise or sloth; nor, to enjoy The pleasures of the flesh, the Soul destroy. To GOD, they will not make a sacrifice Of guiltless blood; or, honour him with lies: Or, offer to him things achiev'd by stealth, By fraud or rapine; nor their Common-wealth Repair, inrich, or strengthen, by oppressions; By tollerating any known transgressions, To Piety destructive; or, to that True Justice, whose defect, may ruinate Humane society; either, by fearing To draw their swords against a Tyrants daring; Or seeking, by a warlike way of murther, How, to inlarge their territories further; In hope of needles gain, or fruitles glory, Rais'd out of black deeds, by a bloody story: But, persecute the troublers of their peace, Till safety, may be setled; and, then, cease: That, throughout the World it may be known, They sought not to inlarge, but save their own; And to disable those from doing wrong, Who, els, would all the World embroyl, ere long. Such, will not make their Publique Faith a scorn, That they who live, and they who are unborn May in times future, be discourag'd from Assisting, when another need shall come; And, let all, rather unto ruine run, Then trust, what is not to be trusted on. Such, will not (as in times of need they may) Take some mens lands, and livelyhoods away, The Publique to secure, without supply, For losse of that, which it was saved by: But, to each private sufferer, reimburse Their private damage, from the Publique purse. Such, will not misemploy their Powr, in place Of supream Trust, unjustly, to disgrace Their faithfull servants, upon bare surmizes, On misreports, which evill will devises To blast their credit, ruine their Estate, (Perhaps their lives too) by objecting hate Which is untrue. For, they not being there Who could refute that, wherewith charg'd they were, (Nor suffred to take notice, from whose tongue They, in their absence, did receive that wrong) A prejudice, doth bring a censure on them, Which ere they can prevent it, hath undone them. If they good conscience have, who thus can do; Ile think, the devill hath some conscience too; How seared are the consciences of those, Who, give their friends, much lesse respect then foes? Obliging them by favours whom they fear, Would els be traytors, (or perhaps so are) And disoblige true men, because, they know No injury can make them lesse then so? What consciences, have they who do pretend, The Publique hath not, to releeve a friend That's perishing; and, yet the self-same day (Though no need were) profusely give away Large sums among themselves; and gratifie Those men, who with their faction do comply? (And own their ways, opinions, and designs) As if they did possesse, the Indian Mines? What Consciences have they, who pay some worst, Who merit best; and last, who serv'd them first? Provide for those; who for self-ends do serve; And let the Common-wealths true servant starve? Give ready Coyn to some; and unto them Who did the same work, at the self-same time, Not any thing at all? except, perchance, A Warrant, Order, or an Ordinance, Which by begetting others, doth still add New troubles, and expence to what they had; And without profit, so inlarge their cost, By pretious time, and tedious labour lost; That, if at first, their debts they had forgiven (And added so much more, to make all even) To get a flat deniall; some, had gain'd Much more thereby, then will be now obtain'd, Though they were pay'd to morrow? One, I know Who by experiment, hath found it so; Yet, some of them, who may this conscience own, Would seem to think, great things on him, bestown: Because, Gods mercy, other wayes suppiles That, which to him, their Justice yet denies. What partiall Consciences are also theirs? Who, in establishing of just Arrears, Gave some full Interest for debts delay'd, And none to others, for like debts unpay'd Ten summers after; and, which may, before They are discharg'd, stand charged ten years more? And then at last, perhaps, aside be lay'd Among those debts, that never shall be pay'd? From such corrupted consciences as these, Hath sprung our Epidemicall disease: Those manyfold complainings, in our streets, Wherewith each friend his sad companion greets: Those scandals, which are publish'd in disgrace Of persons, who were lately in the place. Supream Trust: hence, also, flows that hate, The Quarrels, discontentment, and debate, Which is amongst us: Hence, those hazzards rise Which make us fearfull, and our Enemies Still hopefull, that, it either shall occasion Some broyl within, or, some without Invasion. And, if I may beleeve what my heart tels, That, which they do expect, or somewhat els Equivalent, will shortly come to passe, If we below, and they who are in place Above us, make not conscience of our wayes More then we have done, in preceding dayes. For, if there be a GOD, as my soul knows There is, by that, which daily from him flows: If there be devils, as I know well to, There are by what, I see their servants do. GOD, or the Devill will to us appear By some new Act of Grace, or work of fear, To purge hearts, from death procuring works, And that hypocrisie within them lurks; And keep us to the rule of doing so, To others, as we would be done unto. Of which good practise, whilst he here was living My Westrow (having by examples of giving) Deserved to be a pattern, I, contrived, This way, of having him, again revived; That, I, and you, and others, by the light From hence reflecting, may walk more upright. Lord, let these overflowings of my Spirit, Which, in themselves have neither powr, nor merit, Produce forth good effects; and not be found Like that, which gives an useles, empty sound. Let it be some way, fruitfull unto them, Who had relations in the flesh to him, Who, hereof gave occasion; and, some way To every Reader, who peruse it may; And, not a memorandum only be To other men; but, likewise unto me. Vouchsafe me grace, whilst, here I live to serve (In this my Generation) not to swarve From my appointed work; but to persever In doing it, with vigilant endeavour, That, of my Talent, when I must appear To give account (which time approacheth near) I may be faithful found, and to that joy Admittance have, which nothing can destroy. Let neither fears, nor hopes, neglects, or wrongs, Deter from doing what to me belongs: And, though my faculty hath small esteem, And needles to the World, perhaps, may seem, In those affairs which may be pertinent To thy great work: make it a supplement Of some good use; that, times to come may see My wither'd leaves, did help adorn the Tree During that season, wherein cloth'd it stood; And, were for cure of some diseases good. Of what, in others, to be good, or ill, I have observ'd; let application, still, So to my self be made, that what I saw, To be amisse in them, may me withdraw From erring paths; and, in their steps to tread, Who have uprightly walk'd, (alive or dead.) That, I may truly foot thy measures, too, As well as pipe them out, to those that do: Lest, I my self, a Reprobate be found, When all things have compleatly daunc'd their round. Let not the Revolutions, or the changes, Or, that prevarication which now ranges Throughout the World, me, from my station carry; Or, cause me from good Principles to vary. But, in the stream, of all those great distractions, Diffring opinions, counter-marching actions, Plottings, designings, threatnings, and pertakings, Whimsies, Chimeras, doubtings, and mistakings, Fawnings, and frownings, praises, or disgraces, Wants, and aboundings, in all times, and places, So steddy keep my Judgment, and so clear, That, all my Life, I firmly may adhear, To truth, and honesty; and, plainly see What man intends, or is design'd by thee, And, whatsoere, without me, makes a din; Let, me have alwayes, peace, and joy, within, My life, hath been a Warfar to this day; And troubles multiply: Yet, if it lay Within my powr, to chuse what other lot The best man living hath, (or I have not) And, might my self, my own self being make; Let me no comfort, in my Portion take, If, I, would chuse aught els, but that which now I have, and thy free mercy, shall allow: For, of thy love, so well assur'd am I; Of what, within thy pow'r doth also-lie: And how, thou best knowst, what for me is best, That, on thy Wisdom, Powr, and Love, Ile rest. I, love to see the doing what thou dost, (Oh GOD! most holy, powrful, wise, and just) And, therefore, though my flesh be terrifide By thy approaches, and, oft loth to bide Where, I may stand to see thee marching on, And doing, here, such things as thou hast done: Yea, though sometime, such horrors on me cease, That, they do shake my bones; yet naytheles, My Spirit, so is pleased, to behold Those Judgments, and those mercies manifold, Which I observe; that, in no other time, Nor, (might I chuse) in any other Clime, Would I have liv'd, save where I might have seen Such things, as have to me discovered been: No, though thy Judgments, which, now on us be, Have, in the flesh, with others, wrapt up me, For, whatsoever former times afford; Whatever, hath been written in the Word; What signs, or wonders, have been to thy glory Recorded in prophane, or sacred story, Hath been a new transacted, in my dayes. So, have I seen the River, and the Seas Made passable: So, have I seen thy wonders In blood, and Vermine; in fire, hail, and thunders; And, in those other dreadfull signs, whereby Thou, heretofore didst Pharaoh terrifie; Mysteriously, or morally (at least) If not in all things, lit'rally exprest: And, have observ'd, that, they on other men Have now, the same effects, which they had then. To carnal wisdom, but events of chance They do appear; and, such, to ignorance. Great Kings, and Princes, will not yet be wise, But fool themselves, with vanities, and lies; And, are like Pharaoh, daily hardned so, As if they dared thee, thy worst to do. Yea, their inchanters, though they cannot stand Before thee, (and acknowledg tis thy hand, Which is upon them) do endeavour still, To seek themselves, and to resist thy will. And, all of us, almost as heedles are, Of what thou dost, as Jacobs offs-pring were. Thy Judgments, mercies, threatnings, promises, The severall causes, and effects of these, Have been to me, exemplifide a new, By that, which hath been offred to my view: Th'occurrances, betwixt thy Friends, and Foes, Long time ago, foretipifying those That should succeed, (and, were for Presidents, That like proceedings, would have like Events Throughout all ages) I've seen parallel'd By those, which with mine eyes, I beheld: And, by those tipes, compar'd with what I saw, Did, sometimes from them such conclusions draw, That, I foretold, when few beleeved me, What, they and I, have liv'd, fulfil'd to see. And, though, thou art not pleas'd to let me know, Perspicuously, what is approaching now: Yet, I see dim appearances, whereby I may suspect a mischief drawing nigh. A Cloud, which like a mans hand seems to be, Or, els, a mans hand, like a Cloud I see Threatning a storm. I see, me thinks, oh! Father, Vapours far off disperst, begin to gather Into divided bodies, whence may break A voice of Thunder, and things dreadfull, speak, With sad events; If we with speed repent not; And, thou, the plagues, which we deserve, prevent not. Oh! therefore, turn our hearts; and unto thee So, from our own wayes let us turned be, That, thou maist still continue thy compassion, With thy accustom'd favours, to this Nation. And, my beloved Brethren, for whose warnings, I, thus adventure my dim fore-discernings To publique censure, though not for my sake, For your own safety, notice of them take: And, of your vanities, repent with speed; That, Judgments, but conditionally decreed, May be averted: And, that, those good things, Of whose approach the season symptoms brings, Deferred may not be: For, there is, yet, Somwhat, to be removed, which doth LET, That Kingdoms coming, for which, many pray; And, that Removall, must prepare the Way. If, GOD, this way, by judgments, must inforce, It will, for us, now living, be the worse; And, we shall bear the strong pangs of that BIRTH Which, that mysterious WOMAN will bring forth, On whom, the DRAGON waiteth to devour The MANCHILD, who (deliver'd from his power By his Almighty Father, and our GOD) Shall rule the Nations, with an IRON ROD. But, if we willingly remove from hence, That LET; it shall produce a recompence, Which will requite our labour, and destroy The great Obstructer of our promis'd Joy. Here, I had done. But somwhat, presseth in, On which, I could anew again begin. It doth not much concern my Theam, I know; But, what, of that? It may concern you, tho. My Muse, oft times, when she is on her wings, Wheels from her Game, to unexpected things Which come to view; and, thereby more hath won Somtimes, then if aside she had not gone. So, may she now; Ile therefore, let her fly At what she sees, although I know not why. The Kingdom look'd for, seems to be near By many tokens, which to me appear, As well upon the Governments of those Who, thereto are profest, or secret Foes, As on the SAINTS: For, when I was but young, (And ever since my child-hood, all along) I, thereto had an eye; And, in this clime, (Or little World) I've seen within my time Four Governments, almost as differing Both in the roots, from which they forth did spring, And discipline, as DANIELS Monarchies: And, much, to be consider'd, in them lies, To make me to beleeve, that, CHRIST is shaking The Worlds foundations; and, approaches making. The first was, when much fam'd ELIZABETH, Raig'nd here; In whose time, (though I drew my breath Not thirteen years) I, observations made Of things, then said and done, both good, and bad, More then my age did promise, and, er'e taught, Was to the best part, of my knowledg brought. During this Monarchy, I did perceive, Sincerity, begin to take her leave; That, Christian zeal abate, and cool again, Which was so hot, when she began to Raign; And, introductions of such deviations, As, both forego, and foreshow alterations. Yet, that, which then did seem to keep in aw These Nations, was, the GOSPEL, and the LAW. Next her, out from the Caledonian Wood, A ramping Lyon came; and, up he stood. As, he first got this pow'r, he kept the same, By acting of the Fox, and seeming tame. To his devourings, he impos'd no measure: The Law he govern'd by, was WILL, and PLEASURE; And, he pursude, what he design'd at first, As far, as any crafty coward durst. More stoutly, his Successor, carried on, Then politickly, what his SIRE begun; And after many struglings, and much cost, Himself, his Kingdoms, and desigments he lost. Yet, for that Government, thus much Ile say, Justice and piety, wore in that day, The fairest out side; and, were trim'd about With many Ornaments, now, nigh worn out; And, goodnes, had a very glorious shell, Although the kernels therein prov'd not well. Against this Government, the People rose, In throaning them, whom they themselves had chose: And whilst they were continu'd on the Throne; NECESSITIE, was law, for what was done: Which Law, to lengthen, and corroborate, They, new NECESSITIES did still create; Till their Adorers, did their Pow'r contemn, And, found great need of all things, but of THEM. For, by indulging selfnes, they destroy'd, What had, by self-deniall been enjoy'd; And made themselves so rich, and some so poor, That, now, the Peoples choice, is out of dore. Yet, whilst they kept the Throne, GOD, by them wrought Effects, which will not wholly come to nought: For, though self-seeking, most prevailed then, There were among them, good, and righteous men, (To GOD, and to their Country serviceable.) Whose number, had it been proportionable To ten, for each five Cities, Towns, or Shiers; Had made the work, reserv'd for others, theirs. The SWORD, hath now, obtain'd the soveraign pow'r, Let it, Oh LORD! protect, and not devou'r. Let, it take notice, that it is prepar'd, The Vineyard, only, to secure and gard, (Or, cut away those Plants, which might annoy The fruitfull Vines, and their sweet grapes destroy) Not to possesse the same as if it own. Let us (although the pow'r thereon bestown, Should be abus'd) obediently attend, Till to the raign, thereof, thou setst an end: For, when thou pleasest, thou, canst in one hour, Make it destroy it self, by its own Powr, To rule us, thou hast now advanced it; Let us, for conscience sake, therefore, submit, Whether it be for future good, or ill; Because, to have it so, it is thy will. Thou canst as well by Arms, as by the Gown Rule peaceably, and make thy mercy known. Although it be a Sword, that bears the sway, Let, it thine Adversaries, only, slay; Let none of thine, have any cause to fear it: And, let it no wayes dammage those that wear it. Still, mindfull make it, for whose good, and ayd 'Twas first advanced, disciplin'd, and payd: Who, did contribute, what, first, made it strong To conquer: who, still adds, what doth belong To keeping of that Powr; and, let it not Indanger those by whom it was begot; Wrong their propriety, whom it defended; And whose just preservation was intended; Nor, breake those antient bounds which kept should be 'Twikt man and man; and, betwixt man, and Thee; And, upon whose Infringers thou hast laid, Curse, whereof, all, ought to be afraid. Let it perform the works thereto appointed; Make way for Justice, and for thy Anointed: And, when the time design'd thereto is done, Let it, to what must follow, yeeld the Throne. The next, I hope shall be the LIVING-WORD. Let his long look'd for KINGDOM come, Oh LORD! Let over us, that King of Nations raign, To whom, all praise, and Glory doth pertain. For, whatsoer'e this proves, that best will please us. Come therefore, quickly: Quickly come, LORD JESUS. Mean while, accept a sacrifice of praise, For what hath been vouchsafed in these days, By way of preparation, to that End, For which, in Faith, and hope, we do attend. Accept of praises, from the single hearted, For all thy Saints, which are from hence departed; And, for all those, who shall make up the sum, By which thy Kingdom, will compleat become. Accept my Thanks, for what thou didst confer On me, by him that's gone, and those, yet here: Accept it rather, for that love of thine, Vouchsafed from thy self, to me and mine, By frequent pledges; and, for that Free grace, Whereby before all time, I chosen was, To be eternally made One with Thee; And, in thy self, accept them LORD, of me. Thus, having my Friends Obit, truly truly kept Six nights, (whilst others round about me slept) Here, that Contexture, which conceiv'd I had, Is now produced, spun, and weav'd, and made. 'Tis true the Object, of my contemplations, Was WESTROW: But, from him, my Meditations, Rose higher; and my soul did contemplate Things, which concern these Nations, and this State; And, thereupon, some hints, are interweaved, Which will (if passed by, as unperceived) Make this, which is, the Muses way of giving Life to the Dead; to be, unto the Living, An ominous presage; at least to some, Of death, of shame, or, of worse things to come. FINIS. AN IMPROVEMENT Of Imprisonment, Into Real Freedom; Of Disgrace, Into Honest Reputation; Of Poverty, Into Perdurable Riches; Evidenced in a few Crums &amp; Scraps Lately found in a PRISONERS-BASKET AT NEVV GATE; And Saved together, by a Visitant of Oppressed Prisoners, for the refreshing of himself and those who are either in a worse Prison, or (who loathing the dainties of the Flesh) hunger and thirst after Righteousness. [HE, who, five thousand hungry Souls had fed] HE, who, five thousand hungry Souls had fed With two small Fishes, and five Loaves of Bread, Would have the Fragments sav'd: for, that is sweet To some, which others trample under feet; This Prisoners late Experiments may be, Of use to them, who know much more than he: For, men to credit those, are soonest mov'd; Whose Words to be sincere, by Deeds, are prov'd. By GEORGE WITHER. THE AUTHOR OF THESE Fragments, TO THE Humble, the Poor in Spirit, and to all those Afflicted-Ones, who disdain not these CRUMMS. Experience, though to Fools it Mistris be Oft, makes men Wise; For, some effects on me To that end it hath had: &amp; though with mocks Most entertain my Triple-Paradox, It will, by what ensues (I hope) appear That, Truths, by me, therein averred were; And, that, whatever shall succeed thereon, My Words, and Actions, do concurr in One. Those few, who did here visit me, in love, Seem'd, with so much contentment to approve Their homely Entertainment with these Scraps, That, they were pocketed; and some, perhaps, Them, will Communicate: Which if they do, So let it be, and much good do't them too: I wish, for their sakes, that they better were, But, if, as they did mine, their hearts they cheere, I, may to Constancy, encouraged be By their Example, more than they by me At present are; and mutual Ayd's, ere long, Shall make the weakest of us, to grow strong; For, by GOD's Providence, (not seldom) springs Noblest Effects, from most contemned things. “Let, all, who of these Fragments, Coppies had “These Lines (to be perfixt before them) add. CAPTIVITY IMPROVED INTO FREEDOM By the Grace of GOD. George Wither, to his Friends, who have inquired after him, since the late seizure of his Person, Books and Papers. VVhere I now am, you much desire to hear, What, I am blam'd for; what, I want, or fear; Which, this will briefly tell you: I am well, (In Purgatory, between Heaven and Hell.) My Fact, (which I acknowledge, in good sooth, May some offend) is only writing Truth; And, that is, in prevaricating times, Much more offensive, then some hainous Crimes. I nothing Want, that's truly needful, save Due thankfulness to GOD, for what I have, Who hitherto, in an unusual wise, Without my care, vouchsafeth me supplies; Which hereby, I acknowledge, to this end, That, others may in straits, on him depend. All, I need now to fear, is, that before I shall be freed, I way be made so poor The Messenger, will hardly get his fees, Or, that the Remnant of a Loaf and Cheese, Which at my now forsaken Chamber lies, Will mouldy be, or eaten by the Mise. I do not fear, that what I have exprest Or published, will not abide the Test, Unless my Judges, do, by looking back The Gen'ral-Pardon, ineffectual make: For, that, which I last wrote, was but fruit torn Out of the Mothers Womb before 'twas born, Which, whether Life, or Death receive it should, No man with certainty, determine could; And, if (according unto my Appeals) That, which I purpos'd for the Publick-weal, And honor of the King, may be perused Intirely, and not palpably abused, By taking from, or adding thereunto, I do defie the worst, this World can do; Well knowing, that, if she conceal what's done, From Publick view, yet passeth doomes thereon Which may be to my wrong, 'twill be reveal'd And judg'd by GOD, to whom I have appeal'd. Though now there be not left with me, one Line Of what I last wrote, I no whit repine: For, Providence will further my intent, Thereby, much better, than the course I meant; Or, else will raise up, if that be calcin'd, A sprightlier Product of the self-same kind, Which to obliterate, none shall presume, Nor time abolish, nor the flame consume, Till it hath took effect to that good end, For which I did at first, the same intend; And, Joseph-like, when I shall tried be, Either the King, or GOD, will set me free, To whose Free-mercies only, I appeal Ev'n in those things, which I intended well: For, extream Justice, is a dreadful thing, Whether pronounc'd by GOD, or by a King: And, otherwhile, men of an upright-way, Permitted are, in somethings to mis-say, That Spirits may be tri'd, and those things known Which are of GOD, from that, which is our own. I have not purposely, one Paper hid To cloake the worst, that er'e I said or did; And if men would but at my frailties wink, I'le tell them, when they please, ev'n all I think, Although against my Life it might offend So, their Demands to publick wellfare tend: For, to that purpose, if it needful were, I dare say more, than many dare to hear, (As would be known by what is now surpriz'd, might it be read in publick, undisguis'd) Yet, not exceed my limits ne'r-theless, Or, bounds of Reason, or of Soberness. I have discharg'd my Conscience, as I thought The present times required that I ought, Considering, that otherwise, such Tools May be of use; and, men reputed Fools Speak things, as pertinently in some cases As they, who are imployd in Wise mens places. I am not ignorant, with what disdain Our Pantaloons my Poems entertain; Nor ought displeased, that what I have writ Seem'd Frothy-stuffe, unto a Flashy-wit, My sowr Herbs are as pleasing to some pallats As Apricocks, Muskmillions, or sweet Sallets To wanton Appetites; and wholsomer Than that, wherein they more delighted are. My Verse, to them, seems Vanity to be; So seem They, and all Earthly things to me. By them, I numbred with Phanaticks am, And they, by me, reputed are the same. My Muse, harsh sounds unto their ears applies, Their Manners do as much offend mine eyes; And, if I merit Punishment, who chid them For things misdone, what merit they who did them? Should none Reprove, but persons wholly free From Sinfulness, no Sin Reprov'd should be; And where our general Reproofs offend, Few men, their private Errors will amend. All that is in my Thoughts, my Words or Deeds Approvable, from GOD's free Grace proceeds, And none deserveth blame, but I alone (If I do) for what now is thought misdone. Yet, come not at me, till you may be sure Your Visits may no detriment procure Unto your selves; for (though that I am zealous Of publick Safety) many are so jealous Of our Sincerity, whom they shall find From them, in some things, of a diff'ring mind, That they, who walk by Gospel and by Law, May chance to suffer like Jack Fletcher's Daw, Which taken among Pigeons, Pies and Crowes For whom a Net was laid, did speed like those: And, to help keep an Innocent from starving May censur'd be, by some an Ill-deserving, Which paradventure may be now my Lot. (If Christian Charity prevent it not) More to their shame than mine, who, now have here Been their Remembrancer, nigh fifty year. But, for me, take you neither care nor grief; Death, will much more advantage me than Life: I walk not blindly, in the Paths I tread, And they will make me safe, alive, or dead. I am assured, that his Providence Which orders things of much less consequence (Whether conceal'd or published) will make That which I've written, good effects to take; And also by their means, perhaps, who be As yet displeas'd, both with my Book and me. Grant me but NATURE'S Freedoms, and let then The Priviledge of COURTS and SINGLE-MEN Do what they can: for, I have broke no Law Whereof, a sober Man should stand in aw; Nor need I Patrons; nor ought have I done To make me be afraid, through want of one. I, reverence the Powers that are Supream, And, know so well, what doth belong to them, That, I cannot offend by Libelling Either against the Parliament, or King As many may suppose; for, VICE may be Reprov'd, yet, they kept from Aspertions free; As will appear, when I have open laid What, for my Vindication may be said. I love and honour more, a Foe, that's just Than him, who saves my life, and breaks his trust: And, will not thank them, who, shall see wherein I merit blame, yet palliate my sin; Or, shall excuse me from due punishment, When I shall know my fault, and not repent. Nor will they be excus'd, in future times, (Though yet they may) who make our DUTIES crimes Mine, is (if any) no more but Omission Of somewhat; or, at worst, but a Misprition: And, my Case now, may be resembled well, By what, unto a Northern Lasse befel, Who, having been corrected very sore For calling of her younger Sister Whore, Which was indeed untrue; her Mother, said Unto the lesser Girle, tell truly Maid, Did she not call thee Whore? She answer'd, NO, (She did not) but, she thought to call me so. I know there are those, who consider can What use there may be of an honest Man Who seeketh not for Honours, or for Pelf; Hates none; affects his Neighbour as himself; Fears nought but GOD, and his own heart; his King Doth reverence, and can in Prison sing: When more desire to be affected thus, It will be better both for them and us: And, he who makes these things his chief ambition Though Wrongs he feel, can never fear Perdition. If less than formerly, I am befriended, I, and my Suff'rings, quickly shall be ended. If I find favour, you shall hear that from me Which, to acknowledge, it will well become me: Till then therefore Adew; and hereby know That I am pleas'd, and well, if you be so. Chr. oUr reDeeMer LIVeth. Aug. 12. 1661. From Mr. Northrops, one of the Kings Messengers in Westminster, where I am civilly used. George Wither, His first Meditation, upon his Commitment to Newgate, Aug. 22. For his Poem called Vox Vulgi, neither Published nor Finished. I So; I do now begin to be prefer'd; And from an Owl within an Iviebush, Advanced am, to be a Newgate-Bird, As fast incaged, as my foes need wish. My Feathers have so pluckt already been That, no more I can lose now, but my skin, And when that's torn away, I may presume My Flesh and Bones, in short time, will consume. II I was restrain'd before, but, not so strait Was my Restraint, nor in so close a place; I had my load, but not such overweight, Nor seem'd I, so exposed to disgrace. My Friends were overcharg'd with me before, And will, this way, be now oppressed more: For, that whereof my Judges me condemn, Falls not so much on me, as upon them. III But, is this Newgate, whereof so afraid Offenders are? Is this the dismall place, Wherein, before I came, I heard it said There's nothing, but grief, horrour, aud disgrace? I find it otherwise; and, doubtless, either It is bely'd; or, they who are sent hither, Within themselves, when to this house they come, Bring that, which makes it seem so troublesome. IV I no worse here, then where I was before Accommodated am: for, though confin'd From somethings, which concern my Body more Then formerly, it hath inlarg'd my mind. Here, by degrees, with what the world most fears (With Tormeuts, and their Executioners) I may be so acquainted, if I please, That, things which threaten pain, shall bring me ease. V Here, I can see the bottom of that Pit Which gapes to swallow me: here, I can view What some, who have more prospect, see not yet, Nor will, till they their fears cannot eschew. Here, I find Objects to prepare me for That, which my Fesh and Blood, doth most abhor; And, am assur'd, that, to what place soe're I, hence am sent, that GOD, will meet me there. VI Though here, my outward-being, seems no better, But, in appearance dayly worse to grow, My Inward comforts and my hopes are greater, And, will be greatest when they make least show. Although my Oyl and Meal doth not increase Since I came hither, 'tis no whit the less: Yea, though I am at more charge every day, Then did of late, a weeks expence defray. VII For that cost, they supplied have, to whom My life, it seems, is dearer, then to me; And, they ingaged for me are become; LORD! whence proceeds this kindness, but from thee? So is it, that, I now can hardly tell Whether, my Friends, to save me, shew more zeal Or they more malice, who have sought of late To ruine both my Person, and Estate. VIII I find already, by what I have noted, My best Expressions will concealed be. My Verses (as the Devil Scripture quoted) Produc'd by Scrapps, to disadvantage me. I see my self oppos'd by no small odds, Frown'd on, by mighty men, and mortal Gods Who sit so high, that they nor feel, nor know What things are suff'red, by poor-men below. IX Not onely Railing Foes, on evety side, But my Acquaintance also, and meer Strangers, Unjustly, me defame, Jeer, and deride; Threats follow me behind, before, lie dangers. Yet to no mortal for support I send, Nor make complaints by Letter, or by Friend; Nor will, except to them, to whom belongs The Judging of my Actious, and my wrongs. X My soul, these things consider well, and whence They do proceed: consider why, likewise; Who, puts into thy heart, this confidence; Who, by unknown hands, each dayes want supplies; Who, comforts doth augment as griefs increase; Who, cloathes and feeds thee in this Wilderness, And, when Terrestrial ayds, are quite bereaven Rains on thee, Quailes and Manna down from heaven. XI Mark, how this Realm is here Epitomiz'd, As to a Blest, and Reprobate condition: How Mercies, and how Judgements are despis'd, By most men, at the brinck of their perdition; How few, be wrought upon, in either place, By Threatnings, or by promises of Grace. How many, laugh, sing, swear, curse and Blaspheme Even when, Hell, ready seems to swallow them. XII Here, thou shalt see, that meer Stupidity And gracelesness, transporteth many a man To out-face Death, with less Timidity Then some with all their Moral Vertues can: Here, thou shalt learn, that if thy Prosecutions, Thy zeal, thy Courage and thy Resolutions Spring onely, from a Natural Estate, Thou, with all these, mayst be a Reprobate. XIII Let therefore, these Experiments, with awe Be enteraain'd; and, if henceforth God should (As he perhaps will) common helps withdraw, Let them quite go, and catch on him fast hold. For, if thou then despaire, or shalt distrust His Love, who never was to thee unjust, This, will then prove to be a carnal-boast, And, thou, with all thy vain hopes wilt be lost. XIV Since also, thou dost feel thy heart more prone, By smiles and favours, to be drawn aside, Then by harsh usage, to be wrought upon, Let thy weak'st Bulwarks be most fortifi'd, Lest, they, who have not strength enough to win The Fort by force, by Stratagems get in; And, thou then ruin'd, be past all repair, As many are, by those, who speak them fair. XV That Spirit, try, which thy Resolves begets; For, other while, as resolute are they Who are possessed but with Ranting-Fits, As any, in whom Passion bears no sway. Contempt of Torment, sometimes springs from Madness, Stoutness, from Anger, or despairing-sadness: Martyrs, and men, of Reprobated sence, Bear suff'rings, with small outward difference. XVI Search thou thy heart, therefore, with prudent care, That, Malice, Pride, nor Vengeance lurk therein: That Love of GOD, and all mankinde be there, Linckt with a detestation of all Sin; And, if thou find it so, be not afraid What e're against thee shall be done or said: For, Resolutions built upon that Rock, Will, of all raging Stormes, endure the Shock. XVII Though Princes in their Supream Councils blame thee, And such as are prophane, FANNATICK call thee; They shall not able be, to fright or shame thee, By any consequent which may befall thee: And, if so prudently thou guide, thy Pen That, when it strikes at faults, it spares the men, The Wise will from the Fools, themselves devide, And, every Just-mans Vote, be on thy side. XVIII Though so it alwayes proves not, do not grieve Nor vex thereat: for, what GOD calls thee to, To put in Execution thou shalt live, In spight of all this froward world can do; And future times, will laugh to scorn the storms And Mountains, rais'd by Gyants, against worms When they shall see, (which they will see at last) The Towers of Babel on their Builders cast. XIX Make Jesus Christ, to be the sole Foundation, Of thy Affection, of thy Hope and Trust, Of thy Belief, of thy Sanctification, Of all thy Musings, and of all thou dost: For, nothing Justifies, but, doth Condemn, That is not, In, for, from, and by him, Without respect to any Interest, Except, what, with his Glory, may consist. [XX] LORD, thou hast, by renewing, in some measure My much depraved Will, inclined me, In all things, to submit to thy good pleasure, Let what's defective, now, made perfect be, That, known it may be to this Generation, Man may attain to such a Resignation, That, he shall more delight, thy will to do, Then, that, which his own will, provokes him to. XXI Prais'd be thy Blessed Name, who, as thou didst For Joseph (when he was in Prison bound) For me, in my Imprisonment provid'st, And, by thy servants, every where art found: Be with me, as to be thou hast begun, Until my Generation Work is done, And, when that's finish'd, for which I was born, Let me with Joy, into thine Arms return. To the City of London. VVere I, a Person, who had power to better Thy Trade, or make thy Priviledges greater Or take away thy Citizens Estates, Thy Walls dismantle, or break down thy Gates, I had been lookt upon, though I had done To thee no kindness, neither meant thee one. But, of his love, there is no value made Who nought can to to thy wealth or greatness add, Though he his life should hazzard for thy sake, That, thee for ever, he might happy make. BAI[illeg.], wlll not be vouchsaf'd; but, I must lie Among thy Rogues, expos'd to live or die; To starve or begg; and wholly be debar'd Of Liberty, unpitied and unheard For doing what was honestly intended; And, wherein, I against no Law offended. This is, I must confesse, nor less nor more, Then, I had reason to expect before: Yet, all my labour, is not cast away, For, it occasion gives me, thus to say. I wish'd thee well, and will, what ever shall To me, in my extremities befall; For, here's a number yet within this place, Who are of those in whom the Seeds of Grace So fructifie, that GOD hath superseded For their sakes, that for which his Justice pleaded; And I have in my personal distresse So tasted of their Charitableness, That, thereby I, enjoying health, and life (My self not seeking, but thy peace in chief) Expect that Justice only, from thy hands Whereon thine honour and thy welfare stands; Which neither is thy Riches, or thy Power For, these may come to nothing, in one hour; And, if to them, thou overmuch incline, I will not change my poor estate for thine. Among the Prodigies, by many seen This year, I, might for one, have numbred been, If I, should all Particulars relate Which do concern my Person and Estate: But, they must now Phanaticks counted be Who, either do believe what they shall see, Or dare take notice, of those things that vary From GOD's proceed, in courses ordinary; And, therefore, I think fitting to conceal them, Till that, which is to follow, doth reveal them, To manifest, without all Dubitation, That, God hath spoken to this Generation. Mean while, I'le suffer: for, our Peace must now Not from our Actings, but, from suff'rings flow. Yet, whether, I deserve respect or blame, Know LONDON, since I now thy Prisoner am, That, if I have not wherewith to subsist Thou art oblig'd, to find me bread, at least, Whilst here I shall confinement undergo, Though I had alwayes been thine open foe; And, that 'tis Tyranny (what ere they are) To lay on any, more they can bear. Know likewise, that, if here I shall miscarry Through lack of what, for life is necessary Thou, thereby forfeitest, (as I conceive) A better Charter, then the King can give: Because, through want of Charity to foes, Much more to Friends, our part in Christ we lose. What I have been to thee, it hath been shown; What thou to me art, it will now be known. And, possibly, another Generation Will heed, that I am somewhat to this Nation, Deserving better, then that lie I should Within a Jail, at seventy three years old, For acting and designing nothing worse Then, how to save them from a greater curse. Look to your selves; For, whether bond or free I am; I know, my GOD, will look to me; And, I and mine, shall be both cloath'd and fed, When they who slieghted us, want Robes &amp; bread. So believeth George Wither. Another Meditation, (or Ballad as the World perhaps, will call it) composed by the same Prisoner since his Commitment to Newgate. I My Soul, since we are left alone, In our Confinement here, Where we disturbed are of none, To God, come, draw we near. For, part of his three dreadful WOES, Are now, so carrying on, That, if to him, we cling not close We may be quite undone. II Our selves, let us examine so, That though our foes condemn, We may, for what we did misdo, Make now our Peace with him; Lest, when the world hath fully try'd, How, here we may be vext, We, greater miseries must abide Where, she will throw us next. III SIN, to full ripeness, is not come, nor malice, to her heights; And, we e're they receive their Doom May look for more despights. These, which we have endured yet, Have been sustain'd with ease; But, GOD, it may be will permit Much harder things then these. IV 'Tis but the Suburbs unto Hell, whereto, we now are sent; And (for the future) none can tell What, hereto us is meant. To better men, worse things befall Then seem to be our Meed; And, our Afflictions are but small, To those, which may succeed. V We have not that dark Dungeon seen Wherein, is endless Night; Nor in those, Lowsie lodgings been Which ev'ry sence affright; We feel not that, which many lack; Nor Bolts, nor Gives we wear, Fit things for Belly and for Back, As yet, supplyed are. VI With sickness, we are not opprest, In body, or in mind; No outward cares disturb our rest No Inward fears we find. For, all the suff'rings wherewith we As yet, afflicted seem Are onely such as grievous be, In other mens esteem. VII But, should I, (being old and poor) Diseased grow within, With Aches, have my Limbes made sore, Or, with an Ulcer'd skin Be turn'd into the Common Jail To lie upon the ground, And, all those outward helpes quite fail Which I have lately found. VIII Should this befall us, where might then Our hope and courage be? This, happens oft to Righteous men, And, this, may fall on me. What, but complaints and mournful cryes Would then, be in this place; Harts aking, or still weeping eyes, Scorns, and despaire of Grace? IX These will be then the best Reliefs, That, Flesh and Blood can see, To cure or Mitigate their Griefs Where such Desertious be. Yet, be of nought (my Soul) afraid, For, by his Angels, then, Shall GOD's Assistance be convaid When thou art left of men. X They came unto the Rich mans door At which the Lazar dy'd, And, him to rest Eternal bore To whom, he Crums deny'd; And when Elias had of bread The meanes deprived quite, He by the Ravenous Fowls was Fed At Morning, and at night. XI Their GOD is mine; and if in him, My Trust, I still repose, He, will to me, be as to Them, To save me from my Foes. Or, if of that depriv'd I am which fed me to this day, I know he will supply the same As well, another day. XII The Earth is his, with her increase, And wasted were her store, He hath within a Richer place, Enough, to send me more; And, till it comes; That which doth starve, Discomfort and destroy; My life (whilst useful) shall preserve, And more increase my Joy. XIII The Plagues, which others to Despair, And to Blaspheming move, Shall stir me up, to Praise, and Prayer, And fill my heart with Love. Yea, that which on the Kings of Earth Will dreadful horrors bring, Shall make me with Triumphant Mirth, A HALLELUJAH Sing. XIV The Purging Fire, which them doth burn, Who, therein Raving, lye, Thy Drosse (my Soul) to Gold shall turn, Thy Silver, Purifie. And, when thy Fiery-tryal's past, No loss will come to thee, If thy works Fixt on CHRIST, thou hast, Though built of Straw they be. XV Resolves, which I had not before, These Musings do beget; And though, her Furnace seven times more, The World, henceforth shall heat, My Soul, return thou to thy Rest; For, GOD, hath me assur'd, That, were I ten times more opprest, It should be well endur'd. XVI How blessed is that Heav'nly Place, Where thou, Oh CHRIST, dost dwell! If thou canst bring such Joy and Peace, Into this Earthly Hell? He, with whom, thou still present art, What ere on him is laid, If, thee he loves withall his heart, Needs, no where be afraid. Mewgate, Sept. 3. 1661. A Return, in Answer to some of them, who sent to know how it fares with me in my Imprisonment. God, gave me Grace; by Grace I did conceive A saving Faith; by saving Faith I live. My life of Faith, hath had a preservation, By Hearing, Acting, and by Meditation. By Meditation, I reduce to Words What my Experience in this life affords. By that Experience which I have attain'd, A Patience in my troubles I have gain'd; My Patience hath such hopefulness begot, That, this disgraceful Prison shames me not. Though I am poor (and, as our Proverb sayes) As poor as Job) unto my God be praise, I am no Beggar; for, I have not yet, Been forc'd to ask for Money, Clothes, ot Meat; Nor tempted (having dayly bread) to borrow Through fear of wants, that may befal to Morrow: And, well remembring, who was pleas'd to say There's Care enough belonging to each Day, I, for a day to which I may not live, Will not of what I have, my self deprive. With my Condition, I am pleas'd, and merry, Of my long-suff'rings I am not grown weary. And wish those who pursue me with most hate No worse, then to enjoy the like estate, Except my Bands. I have acquir'd this rest, By those Means and Degrees, afore exprest, And, this, unfeignedly, to you declares How, at this present time, with me it fares. Sept. 7. 1661. from Newgate. George Wither. A Pass-By, in Relation to those, who seem offended at my Frequent-Scriblings, as they call them. Me thinks, I hear some say, who look upon These Papers; will this fellow ne'r have done? Which Questionists, I, with a smile, contemn, Supposing, labour lost, in answering them: For, nothing is more pleasing to their ears Then Scurril Pamphlets, Bawdy Rimes, and Jeers. To them alone, therefore, who take delight In wholsome words, Ile shew why still I write; Presuming, that my Reasons will not seem To merit, altogether, disesteem. Although my former Poems, and my Musings Had not until of late Dayes, those perusings Which I expected, nor now valued be Of many, they have much refreshed me; And, otherwile, for supplements have stood Instead of sleep, of Rayment, and of Food. In Troubles, me, they more content have made Then Wealth, Repute, and all the Friends I had. They cause me to be fearless of my Foes; When I am vext, my spirit they compose; When I am Poor, they are in stead of Wealth, When I am Sick, they help repair my Health; When I am Well, they are my Recreation, When tempted to Despair, Hopes Reparation. Thereby, when Sadness comes, to Mirth I turn it; When I am slieghted, they do make me scorn it. In Prisons, when my Body is confin'd They do so many wayes inlarge my Mind That, doubting whether will for me prove best, The Freedom lost, or that which is Possest, I use the means of Both; but, wholly leave The choice to GOD; and what he gives receive. They are Companions, when I'm left alone; They find me work to do, when I have none. By day, me from ill Company they keep; Make nights less tedious, when I cannot sleep. They ease me, when I am opprest with wrongs; When I want Musick, they do make me Songs. To Friends, who like them (where's no bettet cheer) They, acceptable Entertainments are: Oft, likewise, I make use of them, instead Of Charms, when, I of Fools would fain be rid; For, if I read them, but a page or two, They strait, grow weary, and away they go. They fix thoughts, which would quite slip out of mind, And, when writ down, I them, know where to find; Yea, other men, thereby, have oft teceived Refreshments, if their words may be believed: And (which is more then all this) to GOD's praise, They are, and may be useful, sundry wayes. For these respects, whoever shall appear Pleas'd or displeas'd, to me my Musings are Considerable; and if any one They do offend, them, he may let alone; For, though they have been tendred unto many, I never, yet, inforced them on any, Against their wills; except perhaps it were To save them, whose destruction I thoughr near; And, (I will not be shie the Truth to say No men, have worse requited me, then they: But peradventure, if that dead I were, None daring to be their Remembrancer, (As I have been) they may more mischief'd be Through want of one, then troubled now by me. George Wither's Appollogy for composing the Poem called Vox Vulgi; being a Welcome home from the Counties, Citties and Burroughs, to their Prevaricating Members; saving the honour of the House of Commons, and of every faithfull and discreet Individual member thereof; which Poem was surprised before quite finished. The Contents. The Author, here makes his defence; Clears his asspersed Innocence; And frees himselfe, from Just suspition, Of acting ought, without Commission. Here, I have time to meditate upon, What, I my self, and other men have done, Occasioning my suffering, at this time, And, in relation to what's thought my Crime: Lest, therefore, I may him offend who gave it, I will improve this Leisure, whilst I have it; For, when my Musings, are exprest in words, The better means to Scan them it affords; And to declare, what I shall now expresse, I may hereafter, want both Time, and Place; Or, being dead, before my Tryal-day, My false Accusors, to my charge may lay, What they shall please; and none be certain, why I was committed in this Jayl to die. GOD give me strength, to finish this; and than, Let all my foes, do, and say, what they can. I am not only question'd, for a thing, Presum'd misdone, but also, for the Spring Whence 'tis deriv'd; and pleas'd some are, to say That rending of my whole Estate away, Had me provok'd unto an angry-fit, Which was the Cause, of what I lately writ; And, that I had a scurrulous intent. To cast asspertions on the Parliament. To make it so appear, depriv'd I am, Of what best proves, that, I deserve no blame. My last Conception, (which, before to Light It could be brought, was snatcht out of my sight) May forced be to speak, what I ne'r thought, Or, else, be smother'd, as a birth worth nought: Or, (that an ill intention may appear) Some Verses may be pickt out here and there, (Without those Qualifyings, which precede, Or follow, to illustrate what they read) Whereby, some Inferences may be made, That, on Good-manners, I, intrenched had, In summing up, and personating that Which I have heard, the Common-voice relate: Thus much to be intended doth appear, By what, I do already see and hear. Which falsehood, if, but barely I deny I shall in words alone, retort the Lie; And, Reason may be born down by the noises, Arising from plurallity of Voices, Yeld forth by them, who shall intrude to do, That, which nor GOD, nor Good-men calls them to. I, therefore, will produce a Vindication, That may be justifi'd by demonstration; Or, by such Reasons as will do me right; Unlesse they shall be kept from open sight, Or clipt; or, I not suffered be to say That, which to clear, my self produce I may: And, if so; by the consciences of them I shall be quit, whose words will me cendemn. My Cause, may for the present, injur'd be; But, all the World can do no harm to me. Though that which is without me, wrong'd hath been And may be still, all shall be safe within, So long as GOD, assisteth me, by whom I, with this confidence, am arm'd become; And peradventure, they who think to spoil, This confidence, may give themselves the foile. Their scandal, in the first place, Ile assay, To wipe off, who suppose my losses may Provoke me, or, that my oppressions had Prevail'd, to make me grow a little mad; But, they mistaken are in that surmise; For, to the world-ward, I am not so wise, To be by them distempred, in a mood Like those, who trust in Riches more than GOD; And, by what I am like to undergoe, It will be proved, whether it be so. I am not so in love, as men conceive, With that, whereof the World can me bereave, As to ingage, for such poor Interests, My quiet in this life, by those contests Which I adventure on, if I saw nought, That much more worth such hazards, I had thought: And, this mind, if my Actions did not shew, In former times, those will that shall ensue, When, more undoubtedly those things appear, Which of my Writings, the chief motives were. And will shew whether, I did ought intend To drive on an ignoble, or self-end. It may he known, by what was heretofore Divulg'd, that, nothing now befalls me more Then I expected; That, I did foresee What lately seiz'd on other men and me: That, having been here, in the Worlds great School So long a time, I was nor so much Fool, As not to know, how, Friends, and means to make In seasonable time to save my stake And mend my Game; if I unto that end Had play'd it, which most other men intend; Or, if I thought those men, who look on me With most contempt, were better then they be. I knew as well as any, how to Fawn, And flatter; what to give, and what to Pawn For my advantage, if I could have thought That, worth my seeking, for which most men sought. But though I find it an imperfect Light Whereby at first, I walk'd, it gave me sight Of much more then the World believ'd, I saw, And, kept me of mine own heart so in awe, That, notwithstanding I did for a season Oft stagger to and fro, 'twixt Faith and Reason, (And stumbled otherwhile, into those things Which Ruine, unless Grace prevention brings) I, in the main, pursu'd a Good Design; (Not, I confess, by any power of mine) And by some Symptoms, at the last, perceiv'd, That, till of my Estate, I was bereav'd, My work, would neither well be carryed on (When that time came, wherein it should be done) Nor, take so good effect, as it would then, Upon my Self, or upon other men. For, which cause, when I saw it must be so, Without reluctancy, I, let all go, And without nourishing a secret spleen Against their persons, who my foes have been. This, future things, much better will display Then all which at this present, I can say; As also, that, they who from me of late, Have torn unmercifully, my Estate; By far worse motives thereunto were led, Then those, which me inclin'd to what I did. Loss to prevent, or to regain what's lost, I did adventure no more pains or cost, Then Reason warranted, and obligations Which bound me to have care of my Relations; Or might, then, by pursuing of that course Assure me, how much better'd, or grown worse Men, by those Judgements and those Mercies were, Which GOD, had variously dispensed here; And, having thereby learned what GOd meant I, with my losses was as well content As is a Christian when by Turks pursu'd (Who overpower him by their multitude) He wracks his Vessell on a friendly shore, Where, he hath Life and Freedom, though no more. Why, should I angry be to see that gone Which if I had not lost, had me undone? Which also, will undo them, who now have it, And (if good heed he take not) him that gave it? Or, which will be restor'd again to me, If, for GOD's Glory, and my good it be? Why, should I be displeas'd to be bereft Of that, whose loss hath an assurance left Of better things? Of that, which, whilst possest, Increast my troubles, and disturb'd my rest? Of that, which I must shortly leave (though mine) And, know not (when the same I must resign) Whether, it to their Weal or Woe, shall tend, To whom, when I am dead, it will descend? These things considered, all wise men know That, nor these, nor my former Musings flow From discontentments, or from wrath that springs From loss of inconsiderable things: And Wisemens, good esteems, if keep I may, A rush I care not, what fools think or say, On whom, the less impression it will make, The more I rationally write, or speak. But, that, whereby most blame to me may come, (And, which will probably be charged home) Is an Impeachment for a hainous thing That some are pleas'd to call a Lybelling Against the COMMONS; which, if proved true Ile ask no favour: For, I think none due; And, if it be an unjust imputation I for my sufferings claim a Reparation, Expecting (which ought not to be refus'd) That, what is call'd a Lybel be produc'd To open view, and sight of ev'ry one Who may concerned be, in what is done: And, that, none may usurp a Priviledge Thereon to passe a Sentence as my Judge, Who shall not read, or hear the same throughout: For, Solomon hath freed it so from doubt That, to averr, I shall not be a fear'd, He, that doth Censure what he never heard, Deserveth shame; And I shall rather laugh And Jeer thereat, then either grieve or chafe; Because, (at worst) I, then a Doome shall have, Much like as if, a Fool had call'd me Knave. If left to Publick view, my Poem be, And finisht as intended was by me No worse construction, thereof can be made Then this, that, I have call'd a Spade a Spade; And, means devis'd, whereby men may appear Unto themselves, what others know they are. By fained speakers, I have onely said What was to me by Common-fame convey'd And murmur'd in most places, to worse ends Then that, wheteto my harmless Poem tends: And, if I may presume the Truth to tell I am rewarded ill, for doing well: For, thereby, I not onely turn'd aside That general reproach which was apply'd To all the House of Commons, and, alone To them confin'd it, who brought blame thereon; But, likewise, without personally blaming (Or marking any forth) to their defaming, Have sought to bring it to their Cognisance, Who might thereby, the Publick weal advance; And, who, if it prov'd worthy Approbation Might useful make it for the Reformation Of that, which else, will have a Consequence More hurtful, then my Innocent-Offence, For, though by publication, I had done What might have seem'd a fault; (and now is none) The Generality but little more Had thereby known, then what most knew before, When to worse ends, and more apparant wrongs 'Twas tost, upon the Rackets of mens Tongues; Who, so dissatisfied seem to be By what, they lately feel, and hear and see, That very frequently they are offended Ev'n with what for their welfare, seems intended; Because, they having often been deceiv'd Suspect, some future mischiefs then contriv'd: Yea, then, are things, when plausibly projected, The lesse believed, and the more suspected; Not by those onely, who now called are Phanaticks, but, by those likewise that were Distinguish'd by the name of Cavalier; Yea, and our Jacks indifferent, do begin To be more Talkative then they have been, Because, they find themselves in danger (whether They are of this, or that side, or of neither) So long, as things which Reason order might, Shall passe by number onely, without weight. To intimate, that, Parliaments had been Disturb'd, by some of those, who were brought in A surrepticious way; and, that by them The People were abus'd, is no great crime; Nor is affirming, that they were deceiv'd Unfitting to be spoken, or believ'd, When generally avow'd; nor to averr A Parliament in grosse, may sometimes err, Since, neither to be wise, or Innocent, Is, an inseperable Accident Of Parliaments; as hath apparant been, By that, which we in our own dayes have seen: For, that, they may with Treason, and with Murther, Be charged, we shall need to look no further Then, unto those Transactions which have past, Both in this Parliament, and in the last. What have I then misdone in making known How foolish, mad, or wicked some were grown? How much opprest men are; how griev'd; and how Exasperated, more and more, they grow? What fault commit I, when I hear men say What's done, and what I see done every day, If I declare (sedition to prevent) That I perceive most men are discontent, And froward? since I neither made them such, Nor, therein am concerned half so much As other men? nor did intend a course Thereby, to make what's evil, to be worse? And, since, by that, which lately written was By me, no mischief can be brought to passe, Unless, by accident befall it may, As when Heat melteth Wax, and hardens Clay. It seems hard usage (therefore) to be thrown Into a Jail; of all that was mine own, In my old Age dispoil'd; shut up alone, Where, sick or well (attended on by none) I must in longest nights the hazzards take Of what may happen, sleeping or awake; Not impudent enough, to beg or borrow, Nor having certainty of bread, to morrow, If Charity should fail: which, is a case Much worse, then oft befalleth in this place, To Thieves and Murtherers: yet, this is not Here mention'd as repining at my Lot; For, whereas I am onely lodged there, Where Murtherers and Thieves confined are, The Son of GOD, who for my Ransome dy'd Was twixt a Thief and Murth'rer crucifi'd: And, in my present suff'rings I am eas'd, By being well assur'd, that GOD is pleas'd With what befals; and that I shall at last Be fill'd with sweetness, by what had a taste Of Bitterness at first; and, that to them Who, me and my endeavour now contemn, Things may hereafter profitable be, Which are at present, mischievous to me. Despised Instruments will be of use To bring to mind, that which will help reduce Confusion into order, when apply'd By Meekness, and not spurned at by Pride; And, things which by the world, as much were Jeer'd As Josuah's Rams-horns, when he first appear'd Surrounding Jericho, will bring about As great a Miracle, as then was wrought; Though no Examples, yet, nor good advice, Nor private Admonitions make those wise, Who have not Eyes to see, what they behold Nor Ears, to hear a Truth, when it is told. The hour is not yet come, which I expect May probably give this a good effect. But, there are times wherein that will content For which, we shall at other times be shent. My Poem, stiled OPOBALSAMUM, (Though) more offensive, then my last, to some) The Commons (named the Long Parliament) Did winck at, without show of discontent: Yea, though in plain terms, I made bold to tell Wherein, their faulty-members did not well. I, then (as in the last) had so divided The Goats from Sheep; and had so well provided To save their honour, who least guilty were That (though when first, that Poem, did appear, I was to them a Prisoner, for telling What some of them to hear of, were unwilling) They me inlarged, and vouchsaf'd me more Respect in show, then e're they did before. For, prudently observing, that the shame Which they in chief deserv'd, who were to blame, Was upon all, without distinction flung, (Till, unto those to whom it did belong, I had confin'd it) not one word was spoken To me, which their displeasure might betoken; And, some good use was made, (though I confess Not very much) of what I did express: And, when, by time, that out of mind was wore, I, had as little favour as before. And, so I have had also, ever since; For, still, some at my writings took offence, And more my wrongs, by one foe, one day, were Then all my Friends, could right in twenty year. I may have hope, the Commons before whom I must be try'd, as prudent will become. The Priviledge of WATERFORD affords, The Freedom of explaining their own words To all her Citizens. If my words are Allow'd but that Sense onely, which they bear Grammatically, I no more desire, So that my Poem be preserv'd intire, And perfected with my last thoughts thereon According to my mind when 'twas begun. For, no great credit gain thereby they shall Who weigh a matter, till they hear it all, And, they will much bewray their ignorances, Who heed not Causes, with their Circumstances. There was before my Book, an Epigram Whereby, I wholly Vindicated am From that which is pretended; and, I hear That will not be permitted to appear. If so, I find it, there is mischief meant Which I shall find a Medium to prevent, Unless there be, in some an impudence Much more deserving blame then my offence. That Epigram did evidently shew My Book designed for the private view Of Clarendon, (suppos'd so wise and just, That, him, the King is pleased to intrust Ev'n with his Conscience) to receive his Doom Before, that forth in Publick it should come: Because, that, I was hopeful it might bring By means of him, some notions to the King Whereof his Wisdom, would have made some use To further, what shall to his Weal conduce; And, if that Epigram concealed be It both dishonours him, and injures me. For, lyable it makes him, to suspect That, me, in Ill designs, he doth protect; The wrong to me is without precedent, For, e're I had expressed what I meant With my imperfect Poem, I was seiz'd; Accus'd of whatsoever others pleas'd, And here, unto an ignominious Jail Committed am unheard, and without Bail. I hope for better usage, when the Ring Of suff'rings I have trod, till me it bring Before my Judges: (for what e're is thought) Their honour, I have not infring'd in ought. Their charge, against me, I, yet no not how May honestly be prov'd; but, this I know, The House of Commons may much honour get By well approving that which I have writ (Considering, I therein have appeal'd, To GOD, and men) if, it be not conceal'd. From open view, and mulcts upon me laid For mentioning in private, what was said, In publick by the People; who, thereby And, therein, are concern'd as much as I; Because, my purpose, in that Poem, tends To common good, without sinister ends. And, if we to our selves, may not relate, Our thoughts in words, and them Communicate To Peers intrusted by the Supream Power, (For Preservarion of their peace and our) We are in danger, shortly, to become The veriest slaves throughout all Christendom. But, (as I said in that which was surpriz'd) The Prudent Commons, will be so advis'd When they with seriousness, have that perused Whereby, they are suppos'd by me abused, That, finding none reproved save onely those, Who them in their debatings did oppose; And, that they likewise (after next October, Who were half mad in June) grown wise and sober Will mend their former manners, and become As helpful, as they have been troublesome; Both Parties then, will, peradventure be Thenceforth, as fully, reconcil'd to me As I to all men am; and, what was not Ill-meant, shall be well taken, or forgot. If it be so; It will a Symptome prove Of an abatement, if not of remove, Of some oppressions, to prepare the way For what's reserv'd, untill another day. But, to what end is this Apologie? Not meerly, from this place wherein I lie, To free my Person; or, from that, which may To me befall upon my Tryal-day. No; those effects, must from an abler spirit Proceed: All I can say, or do, or merit, To add a contribution thereunto, So, little, will to such a purpose do, That, rather, more provoke my Foes, I shall And deeper, into their displeasure fall: For, 'tis not pleading in the fittest Season A Righteous Cause, with Arguments of Reason; Nor is it our well-doing; or our saying The Truth; nor Preaching; nor unto them, Praying; Nor our long-suff'rings; nor (when past they are) Good services to them, how great so er'e, That so much moves, as Flattery, making Friends, Large Gifts, and serving of their present ends. I, therefore, have but an occasion took Thereby, to mention somewhat, yet unspoke A Nobler Cause concerning then mine own, (And whereon, Words will better be bestown) Wholly to GOD committing the success Make that, the chief aim of what I express. For, hearing what is done, (by common Fame) And partly knowing, that, oblig'd I am Not by my Nat'ral faculties alone, On me conferred for that end, (or none) But, also, by my Christianity, (And, not a little, by a Moral-Tie) To speak, and write, and do the best I may, To bring them who are out, into their way; And, Ile express, what e're to that effect I do believe may tend; without respect To Persons of a high or low degree; Or, any Powers on Earth, who e're they be. Councills and Parliaments, and Soveraign Kings, I do acknowledge to be Sacred things, Whose Reputation, whilst (at least) they are In being, ought with conscientious care To be preserv'd; because on them depends, That, which to publick woe or welfare tends. Yet, He, from whom all Powers their Being had, And they, for whose sakes onely they were made Ought so to be preferr'd, that, nought be wav'd Whereby their dues, and honours, may be sav'd. We have oft seen and felt, in our own times, That, they of such Confusions, and such Crimes Hath been the cause at least of letting in Much more destructive Plagues, then all the Sin Of Privare Persons; and, that which we know Was heretofore, may be hereafter so. Yea, may and will, in every Age grow worse Unless there be provision of some course To regulate them; and, a free concession (To Persons qualified with discretion) To mind them of their duties, who have dar'd When they to Publick places were prefer'd, Imploy those Priviledges as their own Which were for Publick services bestown; And, often do abuse them, to the wrong Of them, to whom of right, they do belong. 'Tis now high time, that Earthly Kings &amp; Judges, Should wiser grow; and use their Peiviledges, To better purposes then heretofore: For, his great Kingdom, now is at the door, Which will destroy those Empires that begun In NIMROD, and through various forms did run Until the Tyrannies, beginning than Shall have an end in that Misterious-man, Who, by the Dragon, Scarlet-Whore and BEAST, (Though mystically) truly are exprest. Then, shall those Tyrannies, and Usurpations Whereby he, long time, hath opprest the Nations, And therewith, every Branch that sprung therefrom, Unto an everlasting Ruine come; Though some of them are seemingly Besainted, And with fair shewes of Holiness Bepainted. For, I believe (although it doth appear To few men, yet) Divine Records declare Aswell the Term of NIMROD'S Emperies As of Mysterious Babels Tyrannies, Whose time, Six hundred sixty six is known To number out: and, which must be ov'rthrown With that, from whence it sprung, when ripe 'tis grown. That, to be All in all, GOD, may be known. And (as I've oft inferr'd) they, who belong To that new Empire, which will then grow strong, Shall no way need their Persons, to ingage By violent Actings; but, to bear the rage Of their opposers with a patient heart; For, suff'ring onely, will be their chief part. And, he who in the Assyrian hoast did smite Fourscore five thousand Persons, in one night, Shall by the Pow'r and vertue of his Word Perform that work, without thier hand or sword. The CUP of Fornication, so bewitches With love of Pleasures, Honours, and of Riches The great men of the Earth, that, they think none Are sober men, unless they dote upon Those Vanities, and prosecute those Ends To which, their Policy and Power tends, Until they grow as mad or drunk as they; And, then perhaps, for wise men, pass they may. As David sayes, They will not Understand; They will not heed what GOD hath now in hand; But, obstinately still adhere to those Who, tempt them on, unto their ov'rthrowes, Till Ruine comes: For, they are not aware How cheated by those Mountebanks they are; Nor how those Parasites increase their store, Ev'n to excess, by making of them poor: Nor heed they, how, these cause them to destroy Those men, by whom they safety might enjoy With Love and Honour, if they did not lend Their Ears to those, who no Good-men befren'd. They shut their Eyes, and therefore cannot see Into what dangers they approaching be; And, those as much they hate who cross their will To save them, as if they did come to kill. That, which they call, the Reason of the State, Too far insisted on, is often that Which proves the bane of Kingdoms; &amp; yet still Either false Prophets, Priests, or their self-will Therewith besots them; though they have bin told, What thereon hath ensu'd in times of old When, Princes, GOD's directions had despis'd; And acted that, which their own hearts devis'd Although they by experiments had seen, What, of their Policies, the fruits have been. These were of old examples: Saul, thereby Deprived was of Life and Soveraignty. King Solomon, by something like that Knack (To please his Wives) in honour suff'red Wrack. So, Jeroboam, though, GOd promis'd him, And to his seed, a lasting Diadem, By that State-policy, whereby he sought To keep the Throne, the loss thereof was wrought. Jehu, regardless of GOD's promises The same course following, had the like success. High places, Altars, Groves, and Priests of Baal Were chief occasions of King Ahabs fall, The bringing of the Gods of Edom home, In hope that they a strengthning might become Unto his Kingdom, was the overthrow Of Amaziah, and of many moe. State-Policy, made Judah's King contemn The Prophets Counsel, when Jerusalem Was first destroyed, and the Jews inslaved Who, might then, from that Bondage have been saved; And, they who truly sought their preservation Reputed were (as now) Foes to their Nation, Disloyal to their King, seiz'd as supitious, And punished as Factious or Seditious. State-Policy, caus'd breaking of that Oath For which GOD was with Zedekiah wroth, And punished in such a Signal wise That he lost both his Kingdom and his Eyes: And, Politick enlarging of Possessions Or Power, by loading Nations with Oppressions, To further State-Designs (until it wracks Their Loyalties, and then their patience cracks) Hath been, and will be, in all times, and Nations, The cause of Wars, Rebellions, desolations And changing Governments: But, now ere long When human Policy, hath made most strong, The MISTRIS of Terrestrial Potentates, By Counsel, Strength, and by Confederates, Combin'd as they intend (and when their might Hath raised Expectation to the height) Then, She, and They, shall be unto each other A mutual Plague, and be destroy'd together, With ev'ry Person, Family, and Nation, Which is a Member of that Corporation: And then, those PEDLERS who are now so jolly, Shall, packing up the Tokens of their folly Run to seek out where they their heads may hide, From that, whereby, they shall be terrifi'd. Let him, that hath an ear to hear this, hear it; Let proud men tremble; Let the mighty fear it; And let the Meek rejoyce; For, GOD will turn Their Sorrows into Gladness, who now Mourn. It is not only, now, of much behoof, But, necessary too, that sharp Reproof Advice and Admonition, should be given To all Estates and Princes under Heaven, Yea, and particularly be apply'd By some, and in some cases, when aside They from the way of safety, stray so far That, to apparant danger, nigh they are; (How ere they take it, or what ever shall Thereby, to their Premoniters befall) Because, by States, if wickedly inclin'd, The greatest Plagues do fall upon mankind. This made Elia's to become so bold When Ahab, of his wickedness he told Unto his face; and when, to like intent, A Writing, he to King Jehoram sent. This, to reprove King Asa, without dread, The SEER Hanani encouraged. This, made the Prophet Samuel so to School King Saul, that in effect, he call'd him Fool; And, John the Baptist, speak as plainly too, Of Herod, as now they term'd Quakers do To some with us: This, also, did induce King David, who observed the abuse Of Courts and Councils, to cry out on them To this effect; how long! will ye condemn The poor and Innocent? how long! oppress The man, afflicted, and the Fatherless? How long? will ye unrighteously neglect The cause that's just, for personal respect? Do Justice, and vouchsafe compassion more Hereafter, then ye have done heretofore; For, (if it be not) to you, be it known You walk in darkness; you have overthrown The worlds Foundations; wilfully inforce, All things to move out of their proper course; And, that, though GOD himself hath call'd you Gods A difference making (with no little odds) Twixt you and common men, yet, die you shall Like them; yea, die such Death's, as did befall To wicked Princes, who, unto their place Went down, with greatest horror and disgrace. Although such rough Reproofs on silken Ears Grate harshly, and are thought by Flatterers To sound like Blasphemy: This in old times The Language was, in which great Princes crimes Rebuked were; This was the usual mode, Till slavish men, fear'd mortals more then GOD. Thus, David spake unto the Congregations Of mighty men; Thus, through all Generations To them should Truth be told, as need requir'd, By those who, to that purpose are inspir'd: Republicks, Kings, and Councils, Objects are Of such Reproofs, and so reproved were, And, how inrag'd soever they are grown GOD, will be King; his pleasure hee'l make known By whom soever he pleases, that their crimes May now, as well as in preceding times Reproved be; For, States and private men Are every whit as guilty, now, as then. The same at this time, or, the like Omissions, The like Exorbitances, and Oppressions In this our Generation may be found; And more and more, are likely to abound If not prevented: for, the things we should: We neither do, nor suffer those who would, And, if we can but force men to professe As we do, though against their Consciences, We think we have secur'd them to our side; Whereas, when such mens Truths come to be try'd, Who are for fear, or for advantage won To act what is against their Conscience done, (They, being both to GOD, and Men unjust) In them, there's of all other, the least trust: For, how long? or to whom? or unto what Will they be true, who Conscience violate? Doubtless, without a speedy Reformation, It wholly, will corrupt this Generation, Fit us for nothing, but, for what is Evil, And, to be serviceable to the Devil. As therefore 'tis unfit that ev'ry one Should States, reprove, 'tis as unfit that none Perform that Work, and brutish, to conceive That, GOD, the Worlds last and worst Age, should leave Without Premonitors; or, that the dayes Most wicked grown, requir'd not stranger wayes Of Admonition, then have been in use When, of GOD's Grace there was much less abuse: For, Providence, that nothing doth omit Which, either Work or Season, may befit, (Although, but little heed thereof be took) Hath lately, to this Generation spoke By many Prodigies: Each Element Hath very plainly Preached GOD's intent: Yea, many Dispensations, which to us Seem to be wicked, or ridiculous, Have somewhat in them, which relates unto That, which we have done, or else ought to do, Or have Omitted; or else to be Signs Of that, whereto this later Age declines: And, that such things as those, in these last Ages Should be, we have Authentical Presages. But, Visions, Revelations, Prophesies Or such like, now, the common-voice decries As at an end: which I, confesse, is true As they concern revealing Doctrines new To saving Faith relating: yet, of that, Which may concern the Temporarie State Of CHRIST'S Church Militant, or his Elect In Actings or in Suff'rings to direct; Or, of unfolding Prophesies to them, Which were seal'd up, till an appointed time, GOD, hath vouchsaf'd in season, Revelations As need required in all Generations, By whom he pleas'd; and frequently, by such As, by the world, were not esteemed much. Some think, that nothing meriteth regard Save what by Ancient Prophets, was declar'd, Who were immediately inspir'd from Heaven, By special Warrant and Commission given. Be not deceiv'd; the same Commission, still, Is extant with us, under hand and Seal, In Execution to be put, by all Whom, for time being, GOD shall please to call To be his Prophets; who, aswell may now As heretofore, be called from the Plow, From Herds, Fruitgathering, Fishing, from a Trade Which, in the World small reputation had, Or (as when Christianity began) From being an extorting Pablican; This, may believed be; for, what is else The meaning of that Scripture which foretells Their Sons and Daughters in the later times, Should Prophesie? That, old men should have Dreams, And young men Visions? Mind too (if forgot It be) and know it, if you know it not, That every one, who hath an Interest In CHRIST, is now, King, Prophet and a Priest, (Anointed, at renewing of his Birth, To do him services here upon Earth; And stands oblig'd, as he occasion sees To execute all these three Offices According to the measure of GOD's Grace Bestown, and in his proper Time and Place; And, these impower'd by his Commissions are To Parliaments, and Councils to declare (At least in general terms) what may prevent Dishonouring God, or common Detriment; And be Remembrancers, of such like things, As need requires, unto the greatest Kings. Kings, also, should have still attending them Such SEERS, as to David in old time The Prophet Nathan was. But, in the stead Of such, Baffoons, or Jesters do succced, In Princes Courts; by whom, they sometimes are Inform'd of useless truths, by way of Jeer; And, other while, perhaps, a formallist, So far as it with Courtship may consist, Will mind them of such duties as they see By them perform'd; but, such as wholly be Neglected, and by whose neglect they may Be quite destroy'd, they, not a word will say. On many Kings; their lies a heavy charge; Their Kingdoms are both Populous and large; There, likewise, are so many thousand cases Which do concern their Persons, or their places Or other men; and such a few there are To represent them to a Royal Ear And, likewise of those few, there are so few Who represent unto them what is true, That, whilst a freedom is allow'd to none To shew them what's destructively misdone, Or, what is fam'd; All their Prerogatives May not secure their Honours and theit lives: Especially, at such a time as this Wherein GOD searcheth after what's amisse; And, hath already, both begun to cast Into his fiery Furnace, and to blast All Humane Wisdom, Pow'r and Righteousness (Yea all, wherein their confidence men place) That, they may know, all Evils do from them Proceed, and all things, that are good, from him. Moreover, that, which long since was foretold, Some of this Generation shall behold, In differing States, and with as different Passions According to their differing Inclinations; And by the Men, and means the world despises, In spight of all that Hamaue wit devises It shall be brought to pass; And, they who did Defend the noblest Cause, then, best shall speed. Oblig'd, for these respects, is ev'ry one To do, what in his place is to be done, That GOD's Will, so far forth as Power is given, May here be done on Earth, as 'tis in Heaven: A safe condition, they are alwayes in Who trust not in their merits; hate their Sin; And their endeavours labour to improve In Faith, and Meekness, Patience, Hope and Love; That this may be effected, whatsoever It costs them, in pursuing that endeavour. For, Priviledges of the Humane Nature, More Sacred are then those of any Creature Beneath the GODHEAD; and, to all Mankind He is a Traytor, who hath ought design'd Against that Interest; and therefore, I Vow, in defence thereof, to live and die. In order thereunto, I now employ, The Faculty and Talent I enjoy, Which, GOD hath made proportionable to The works, and men, with whom I have to do. That, which I suffer for, on this Account Was done; By GOD's Commission I have done't. If truth I write, I am no whit to blame, If it be false, I an Imposter am; And, let the Commons, when that next they meet, Deal with me for it, as GOD shall permit. I have discharg'd my Conscience: And, if me, He will not save, I, saved will not be; Nor will I, in this Cause plead one word more, Then, this, and what I've written heretofore. I know the World; she also knows her own And, we shall both ere long be better known: Mean while, this my Imprisonment to me Will my Teipsum nosce, prove to be. This also, and what's formerly exprest Of me, and of this Age, will be a TEST. Now, Ile retire unto my self, and sing To GOD, be glory; and God save the King. They, who are wise will observe these things; and shall understand the Loving kindness of the LORD. Psal. 104. 43. Another Meditation in Newgate, somewhat alluding to this old verse in Seneca, Nunquam non Potest, esse Virtuti locus. Which implies, that no Place, or Time can disadvantage an Honest-man. There's diff'rence in the self same Times and Places, As GOD conferreth, or withdraws his Graces; Or, as our Cause is; or, as we shall find Our hearts, to be ought more or less inclin'd, To bring the Flesh into a due subjection, Unto the Spirits Dictates and direction. For, this Place, I perceive to be the same To me, which I unto my self, now am, And, not that, which it is to most of them Who are with me confined at this time. My Burthens (though as great) are made more light, Then theirs are unto them; The day or night, Are no whit tedious; nor unpleasing make My sleep, nor Cares renew, when I awake: But, I as well contented am become, In all respects, as ev'r I was at home; Although, as well by my Intelligence, I, my Afflictions feel, as by my Sense: For, ev'n those things, which in themselves are bitter, To cure Distempers, prove not onely fitter, But sweeter too, then that which in times past Was more desir'd, and did most please my taste. The want of sleep here, and of such like things As else where, and at other Seasons, brings Pain to the Flesh, and to the Soul vexations, Are eithet made to me sweet Recreations, Or give Instruction, in another mode, And more effectually, then things abroad. Last night, as in my Bed I musing lay How Time and Life, and all things pass away; How needlesly our selves we vex and pother, Destroy, afflict, and persecute each other; What cost, and pains, and time, we spend to build That, which will in a little while be spoil'd; And, how, the quiet of our lives we trouble About our structures of wood, straw and stubble; Which, when our several Fiery Tryals come, Will into smoke and Ashes, quite consume; It made me take into consideration What I had Built, and upon what Foundation, That, I my self, might therein be secure Although my Works, the flame should not endure. And, thereof, having an assurance got The loss of all my Works disturb me not: For, I, a thousand times more pleas'd am grown With his on whom I Build, then with mine own. My Soul then, (which in her complantings, Flies like an Eagle mounted on her wings Through wayes, which to no othet can appear) To various Objects, scatter'd here and there, Her Flights directing; at the last descri'd That Flame, whereby the works of men are try'd; To which, mine Eye of Contemplation turning, To see each single humane structure burning, It was to me, a much more pleasing sight Then Bon-fires on a Solemn Day at night When young and old men round them in a Ring Do sit and hear a Fidler play and sing; And, 'mongst all things, which to the Fire then yielded, The Paper works which have been lately builded Did make the greatest Blaze; and to mine eyes Appear'd to be the best Burnt-sacrifice That had been off'red in this Age by men, By, at the least, nine and a half in ten; Because, they have a prime occasion been Both of our present Plagues, and of much Sin: And, griev'd I was not, that, some of mine own Must into that refining fire be thrown, For, though that useful they might be some way, Much of them, have (I fear) too much alay. There are among our Papers-Edifices, Some useful, sanctifi'd, and harmless Peeces Which may be helpful to preserve those Notions Whereby, our Faith, our manners and Devotions May be improved, and likewise to clear The Lanthorn, which the saving Light doth bear, From those bedaubings, which the Foggs of Time, And mists of Ignorance, have made so dim, That, many things, it very dubious makes And doth occasion manifold mistakes: But, they are buried so in heaps of trash, So choakt, with intermixed Balderdash, And, so supprest by them who hate the Light, (Or, persecute the Authors with despight) That, they are but like here and there a spark, Which lies at Bopeep, twinckling in the dark; And, would be quite quencht, if not oft reviv'd. By him, from whom, they were at first deriv'd. Yet (like the Fire which in a Wat'ry-Pit, Was hid) although such sparks be clouded, yet They will break forth; and kindled by the blast Of GOD's out-breathings, raise a flame at last, That shall quite burn up, those huge Piles of vain And Pestilent contrivements of the Brain. For, they are, and have long time, been the Tinder Of Pride and Lust, and Discord. They, do hinder The Publick Peace; The growth of Truth and Love They do obstruct; All wickedness promove, And all Prophaness; Ignoranee they cherish, Destructive Animosites they nourish: Yea, have so fill'd the world with Books of lies, Patcht up with forged probabilities, That, 'tis impossible the Time succeeding Should know the Truth of any thing by reading, Without a more then common Intellect Or, some Divine Assistance to direct. For, they have put on most things, such disguises, That, Vertues, hardly can be known from Vices, Or Truths from Heresies, or wit from folly, Or things prophane discern'd from what is holy; Nor cheating Sophistries, from soundest Reason, Nor Right from wrong, nor Loyalty from Treason; Nor Reprobates from Saints; nor Saints from Devils, Nor saving Doctrines from destroying Evils, Except some help which hath vouchsafed been From GGD, shall much improve the Light within. This notwithstanding, pleased be to know, (Although there is to them pronounc'd a Woe By whom offences come) it fitting were That, if an Evil be, it should appear: And, (since GOD doth permit it for Probation That good and evil in each Generation Sholdu manifest it self) that by the Crimes Of others, men Approv'd may know the Times, We with a sanctified heart should heed them And, to those ends improve them when we read them For which they were permitted. Thus, from Acts That evil are, the prudent man extracts Good uses, as Physitians when it needs, Extract good Physick out of poysonous Weeds. Thus far, my Muse before I was aware Had rambled; But, Ile cast the Lure up, here. These, &amp; such thoughts as these, me waking kept Whilst, many Dream'd of other things, and slept. This, of the last nights Musings, portion was; (Which, if you please, may for a Vision passe) And, when the morning came, thus, into words I put, as much as memory affords. Newgate, the 27th. day of the 7. Moneth, 1661. A Meditation, occasioned by the same Prisoners calling to mind, Jeremies Prophecie to Ebed-melech, the Blackmore, Jerem. 39. 15. I am oblig'd, as much as I am able, To be to other men as comfortable As they have been to me; and, though And Peter said long since) Gold I have none as John Nor silver) what I have, I will repay, And, that, perhaps, may useful be some way. What was Ebed-melech, but, one of those Who, Nationally, were esteemed Foes, To GOD, and to his Church? which way, can we By what is writ of him, advantag'd be More then by other Common Histories, If, from what's mention'd in such Peophesies, We may not with good warranty, apply The same rewards of Faith and Charity, (To ev'ry man in every Generation) Which was recorded by the Jewish Nation, Both to infuse and warrant, the same hope Which was confirmed to this Æthiope? But, doubtlesly we may; since, for our learning For our direction, comfort and forewarning, All those things, principally, were ordain'd Which, in the holy Scriptures are contain'd. This person, represents to us, our state By nature, and as men regenerate. The life of Jeremiah he preserved, Who, else, within a Dungeon had been starved: Him, forth out of a lothsome Pit he drew, When, nor Prince, Peer, or Priest, nor any Jew To him vouchsafed mercy: he, alone, Did more then any Isra'lite had done, Although a Gentile, and a Courtier too, Who, seldom, works of Charity, will do. And, this, was so accepted of the LORD, That by the self same Prophet, he sent word (Ev'n whilst that he detain'd in Prison was As I am now) that, when upon the place Of his abode, the dreadful doom foretold Inflicted was, he should the same behold; And, that, to him, on their destruction day His life, should be vouchsafed, for a prey. This Signal Mercy to my mind was brought, In this place, pertinently, (as I thought) Why, from this Patern therefore, may not I Who, for declaring truth, imprison'd lie, Shew forth that mercy which I have receiv'd And whereby, I am hitherto repriev'd From what to me, might probably have been As bad, as that which Jeremy was in? For, Age and Poverty, in such a place, Might quickly have destroy'd one in my case. My Soul, for this Compassion, praise thou him Who hath vouchsafed it; and blesse thou them My gracious GOD, who were the Instruments In that, which my destruction here prevents: Although, they of a forraign Nation are not They, Neighbours, Kinsmen, or Familiars were not But all of them (except a very few) Such, as untill of late, I neither knew In Person, or by name; some of them be In judgement also, differing from me In some points; which, infallibly doth prove Their Faith is true, and perfected by Love. Their Charity. (This I dare boldly say) GOD, will reward, upon their Tryal day; And, in those future dreadful Visitations Which, likely are, to come upon these Nations Preserve their lives, to see them, who oppresse, Receive their portions with the merciless. As sure, as I yet live, it will be thus; Or, they, at least, when Christ calls them, with us, Before his Judgement-throne; repaid will be What they have here vouchsafed unto me; For, mercy, though extended to a Beast (Much more to man) with some reward is blest, And, though I were a more unworthy wretch Then was by Nature, that Ebed-melech, Yet, forasmuch, as me they have received As one of Christs Disciples, and relieved, (What er'e I am) he, Charity regards, And, they, accordingly shall have rewards. Newgate, Sept. 26. 1661. An Antidote against Fear, composed upon the Citizens being unexpectedly in Arms, Sept. 28. 1661. at night. God, keep all safe abroad; I'm in my Bed, And, see no danger yet, or cause of dread. Emanuel my Protector is become, He, keeps all Pannick-fears out of this Roome, And, though the Devil and my Foes together Confederated, they can bring none hither. Here's nought, that any way doth me disease, Unless, it be a few poor starveling Fleas, Which, I perceive are more afraid of me, Then cause I have of them afraid to be: For, if I do but shrugg, where it doth itch, They skip into a hole, and there they couch. No Thief, I think, to rob me dares appear, Within these Walls, the Gallowes are so near; And, likewise, I believe, 'tis known full well, I've nought to lose, nor ought for them to steal. I no Back-biters had, since to this house I my Commitment had, except, one Louse Which now is dead, (not having left behind A son or daughter, that I yet can find) And, though I were assaulted with a score (As here, some are oft-times with many more) I am assur'd, my Landress hath a gift To rid them; and it is a cleanly shift. I do suspect, that, thus it doth not fare With all men, who rejoyce that I am here; But, that, although they speak big words and grin, They have more fears without them, or within; And, that, some thousands who yet walk the street With more, and with worse misadventures meet: For, Terrors are abroad, and ev'ry where It doth in Language, or in looks appear. I, just now, hear a sound like to Alarms; Drums beating, and the clattering of Arms; I (as they pass along, hear Souldiers voyces, Words of Command, and Military Noises, Which, by the time, and darkness of the night, Doth many of the Neighbour-hood affright, And makes me think (although I cannot tell What is amiss) that, all things go not well. What should the matter be? I hope, the men Whom we saw dead, are not alive agen; For, though I live yet, (and live longer may) I did expect to rise, assoon as they. Most hoped, they, er'e now should have been free, From that, wherewith disturbed they still be; But, many see, here's dayly an increase Of what, may more infringe the Common-peace. The Citizens, I hear, strict watch do keep This night, in Arms: I hope, were they asleep We should be safe; and that, this will hereafter Yield much less cause of sorrow, then of laughter: For, all our Factions are now of each other So fearful, that they'l hardly come together, Unless affrighted in the dark they are, And fall foul on each other, unaware. Men might (if there withall they could be pleas'd) Of pains and cost and troubles, be much eas'd, (With much more safety, and more, honour too) Yet, make no night Alarms as now they do. He, that's a pious, and an honest liver, Needs not the Mores Bow, nor the Parthians Quiver, Nor, to be singly, much less double garded: For, Innocence is by it self, well warded; And, when she's most maliciously surrounded, Then, soonest, her Oppressors are confounded. Of all the Foes, that are, or ever were, There's none so bad, or dangerous as Fear: For, it not onely many a man distresses, When Plenty, Power, and Honour, he possesses, (And all the pleasures of his life destroys, Whilst ev'ry thing he seemingly enjoyes) But, makes Plagues also, which will never come To be a greater torment unto some, Then they are, or, then they can be, if all Whereof they are afraid, should them befall. Moreover, it is such a foe as none Can easily escape when seiz'd upon. Nor Power nor Policy, nor Walls of Brasse To keep it out, can strengthen any place; Nor Flesh and Blood, by Sratagem, or Ginn Expell it can, when it hath broken in. Were all the Wealth and Weapons in the Land, And all the People, at one Mans Command, They could not fortifie his heart from fears; For, Terrours will creep in ev'n at the ears, And passage make through ev'ry other Sence, In spight of all resistance and defence. That Fear is such a Terrour, I well know For I have felt it, though I do not now, Save, as a natural passion, which, if well We moderate, is, what a Sentinel Is to an Army; and by Flesh and Blood, Though, possibly, it cannot be with stood, (Especially, when by a wilful Sin, Against Good Conscience acted, it breaks in And growes inraged) yet, by Grace we may Subdue it; And, this, is the only way. Take Fear and Love, well tempered together, (As much, as may sufficient be of either) Fire quencheth Fire; The oil of Scorpions, heals, The Scorpions sting; and, if, of all things else You would be fearless, you must fear GOD, so As man ought; Do, as to be done unto You would expect, and to that Fear, add Love; For, Love expelleth ev'ry other Fear (If placed on right Objects, and sincere) Plucks up all Vices, and plants in their places Habitual Vertues, and Celestial Graces. The Love of GOD, with Filial Fear begins, And with a detestation of all sins. The knowledge of our Natural Estate, In us, Desires to cure it will Create. The Love of GOD in Christ, then, being known, (And, what, when we incurable were grown He hath done for us) will more Love beget If we no false suggestions do admit; That Love, will also, dayly stronger grow If we GOD's nature truly learn to know. And, not as Eve did, him suspect of Evil; Ascribe to him, what's proper to the Devil; Suspect the Promises which he doth give us; Nor think that he intendeth to deceive us. For, if we love him, we will then believe him, In all his Attributes due Glory give him. We then will do, and not disputing stand, Of that which he forbids, or doth command. Nor fear, nor stagger, from that Resolution (Who ever countermands their execution) But, love him so, as having understood That all his Works, and his Commands are good: So love him, that, we love his whole Creation, Nought hating, but what's his abomination. We will not then permit Humane Tradition With his known will, to stand in competition; Lay bonds on them, whom he from Bondage frees; Charge him, with Ordinances and Decrees Which he did never make; but forged were By him, who, layes for ev'ry Soul a snare; Or, by his Instruments, whose Merchandizes And Pomp, are much advanc'd by those devises: We will not, when he graciously invites, To penitence, reject him with despights, And, foes implacable, to them appear Who zealous of their Weal and Safety are. These are the Well-springs of those many errors Distractions, miseries, and Pannick Terrours Which are among us. That, which chiefly here Begetteth troubles and augmenteth fear, Is, want of such a Fear, and such a Love, As may become effectual to improve Those Judgements &amp; these Mercies, which our eyes Have seen; &amp; whereby, (though we see GOD tryes These Nations to this day) nor Prince, nor Peer Nor Priest nor People, doth as yet appear So mindful as they ought to be of that Which, was, for, or against them, done of late: Nor see I any Fruit which thence proceeds, Save Thorns &amp; Brambles, Thistles, tares or weeds. But, they who stop their Ears and shut their Eyes, Against those Wonders and those Prodigies, Which have been lately sent to startle them From that security, wherein they Dream; And they who are not much displeas'd alone With Publication of what God hath done, But, also with his Word; shall see and hear, Those things, ere long, with trembling &amp; with fear, Which will not be concealed; but, befall So openly, as to be known to all. These, have the causes been, that Christendom Is lately, an Acheldama become; For, these are those things, which advance the works Of Antichrist, and make way for the Turks. Let us repent therefore, whilst we have space, Lest Fields of Blood, be turned to Golgotha's. Let us, in this our Visitation day Give ear unto GOD's Voice, whilst yet we may; Not like Bruit Beasts pursuing one another, But, lincking fast in Charity together, Be reconcil'd to GOD, with Loving-awe: For, that sums up the Gospel, and the Law. Do this, and if of ought you fearful be, Let all, that you can fear, fall upon me. A short Excuse, rendering some Reasons why this Prisoner makes no Adresses for his Release, to great Persons for their Favour in his Cause. I am inform'd, by men of good report, That, there are Noble Pers'nages in Court Who hate Injustice, and, are of their Tribe, Who love not baseness, flattery, or a Bribe; And, that, should I my self to these Adresse, I might perhaps obtain a quick release. 'Tis possible; But, I may much indanger Their Quiet; and, am now grown such a stranger To Courtship, that I cannot Complement, Or, act effectually, to that intent; Nor think it prudence (were I mov'd that way) To seek a Needle, in a Trusse of Hay. 'Tis not my Principle (though other while I have been over-ruled, to beguile My understanding) that course to endeavour; And, having found it unsucesful ever Resolve now (be it for my gain or loss) To signifie my Cause, to them in grosse, In open Courts, to whom it doth belong, To be my Judges of what's right or wrong: For, if impartially, they will not hear My cause at large, and do me Justice there, I will not be oblig'd to any one To do for private ends, what should be done, For Justice-sake; because, where one man shall Be so corrupt, it may corrupt them all; And in each Case, by turns, for unjust ends, They may Bribe one another for their Friends As heretofore they did, and, as they may Hereafter, whatsoever I do or say. Not much esteem of any thing I make, Which other men, can either give or take. Nor Safety, Wealth, or Honour pleaseth me But that which will inseparable be From me; and which I may attain unto, And, also keep, whether men will or no. Vertue's the Fountain whence true honour springs; Not Popes, Grand Segniors, Emperors or Kings, For, what they give to make men Honourable, To me appears to be so despicable That, though most men, do their chief darling, make it If they would give it me, I would not take it: What, is there likely for me to be done, By those, who such-like Baubles dote upon? I, never hitherto, a kindness had By any Friend, which I my self have made; But, by such onely, as God had inclin'd (Without a by-respect in any kind) To do me Justice, or to shew compassion, Mov'd by their own Heroick inclination: And, to that end, GOD, often heretofore, Hath from among meer strangers, rais'd me more True Friends at need, my cause to undertake, Then I deserved, or had pow'r to make; And, as it me contented much the better So, thereby, was their honour made the greater. Most seek the Judge; but, I believe his word, Who said, The Judgement cometh from the LORD; And, unto me, it seems an indirect Aspersion, or a Symptom of suspect, A Judge, in private to preoccupate, And, him by Friends, or Gifts to captivate; For, in great Counsels, men should nothing do In love to Friends, or hatred to a Foe. I have observed, that, Judicial Courts Whether they be of good or bad reports, (Or, whether, what is actually there done, Seem just, or to the wrong of any one) Are guided by a Spirit, which directs To what is alwayes Righteous, in respects Unto GOD's Justice, though perhaps it may A Humane Righteousness infringe some way; Or, though they, to whom Judgement is refer'd, Through Ignorance, or Wickedness, have err'd. Ile therefore, make no Friend, nor fear a Foe, But, when the COMMONS call me I will go To hear their Charge, for which I have begun To suffer, er'e 'tis known what I have done; That, least I break or die before the time In which I must make payment for my crime, (If crime it prove) they, rather, overweight May lay; then, that, which is a Dram too light; For, punishments are usually well paid, Though other debts till Dooms Day are delay'd: And, Innocence, is oft pursued further Upon suspect, then real Theft or Murther. In that, for which unheard, some precondemn My Person hither; I, TO GOD and them Whom it may most concern, Appeals have made Whereon, I ought a Tryal to have had Before I suff'red. My Appeal prefer'd To GOD, hath betwixt him, and me, been heard Within his Court of Conscience in my heart; And, there am quit of what may on his part Be brought against me for what I have writ. He sees it, though the world concealeth it; And, read it must be by the Commons too, Ev'n quite throughout (if Justice they will do) Before they censure it: Needless it were, If just and conscientious men they are, To Court them to their Duties; and so strong No Charm of mine can be, whereby a wrong May be prevented, if to take that ill They be resolv'd, which flowed from Good-will. At all aduenture, wholly to the Laws, And to their Conscience, Ile refer my Cause; Alleage for my defence, what I can say, And bear that, which will follow, as I may. A Composure, for his private Refreshment made by the same Prisoner, upon considering the sad outward Condition of his Dearest Relations in the Flesh: after which is added the Narrative of a sudden distemper thereupon ensuing. My Contemplation, evr'y hour so travells, In new pursuits, and into all things Ravells With so much restlessness, as if she ment The whole world in a Mapp to represent. One while she maketh introdes on my Foes, To bring me some Intelligence from those; That, I consid'ring what they go about Their malice, may the better weather-out. Another while, to me she represents, What mischiefes, troubles, fear and discontents There are abroad; that, I may thereby see How, they are troubled, who have troubled me; How 'twixt the two shoars, Pharohs Army reels; How, GOD hath taken off their Charret Wheels How, he obdures the Insolent and proud; How dreadfully, he looks out of the Cloud Which he hath placed, betwixt them and those, Whom they pursue to their own overthrowes. Sometime, she brings to my consideration GOD's Love, and inexpressible compassion, Who, in an extraordinary wise, Not onely hath vouchsafed me supplies By those who to my Person strangers are, But also, with such love and tender care Of my safe-being, that I may of them (As Christ did, when his kindred ask'd for him) Say, These my kindred are; These, are my Mothers; These, are my real Sisters and my Brothers. My Dear'st Relations in the Flesh, among Those Friends, this day, appeared in the throng To be consider'd; and, I must confess My Bowels yern'd, to think on their distresse, And, mov'd with pitty, it compel'd my Muse, To clothe in words, that, which now next ensues. I All suff'rings, that have tended To my probation, here, Cannot be comprehended In what my words declare; For, though to help expression I have a knowing-sense, The sum of my Condition Cannot be gathered thence. II In Pleasures, and in Sorrows, I have had no small share; Sad Nights, and joyful Morrowes, My Portion often were; That, which with Joy affects me, Is far above the Skie, And, that, which yet afflicts me As deep as Hell doth lie. III My near'st, and dear'st Relations, Unmention'd though they be, Among my Meditations, Are not forgot by me. For, though I would not mind them, My heart, them so retains, That, there, I still shall find them, As long as life remains. IV Lest that might have miscarry'd Which, to neglect I fear'd, Like one, quite dead and buried, I have to them appear'd: And by my late employments, Despairful they are made, Of me, and those enjoyments Which else, they might have had. V Reciprocal Indearments, Are by my troubles crost; The means of their Preferments With my Estate are lost. These times, have quite bereft them Of that which gave content, And, in their power nought left them, New mischiefes to prevent. VI My Blossoms are quite wither'd, My Leaves are much decay'd; My Fruits, by those are gather'd, Who nothing for them paid; I, from whom (when they need them) They should supplies have had, Have neither Fruits to feed them, Nor boughes to give them shade. VII We could, when we were troubled, Each others hearts have eas'd; Converse, our pleasures doubled, When we with ought were pleas'd; Such Comforts, now to give them, Companion they have none, But, they (what ere doth grieve them) Must sit, and grieve alone. VIII In Mercy, LORD, look on them, And pitty their Estate; The wrongs that I have done them, Proceeded not from hate; I did, what I conceived Doth to thy work belong, But, that's thereby bereaved, Which is to them a wrong. IX Thereof, be therefore heedful, Them, favour not the less, Supply with all things needful, In this their great distresse; And, when thou me shalt gather Out of this Land of life, Be thou my Childrens Father, A Husband to my Wife. X When I with them must never Speak more, by Tongue or Pen, And, they be barr'd for ever, To see my face agen. Thy Loving kindness show them, Lost comforts to revive, Instead of what I owe them, And pay not whilst I live. XI Let all my former failings, Through frailties, in time past, And, what may cause bewailings, Quite out of thought be cast; And, onely recordation Of those things be exprest, Whereby their consolation May dayly be increast. XII Preserve them from each Folly, Which ripening into Sin, Makes Root and Branch unholy, And brings destruction in. Let not this World bewitch them, With her besotting Wine, But, let thy Grace inrich them, With Faith, and Love Divine. XIII And, whilst we live together Let us, upon thee call; Help to prepare each other, For what, may yet befall; So just, so faithful hearted, So constant let us be, That, when we here are parted We may all meet in thee. This being writ, and once or twice sung over, My Reason, did sufficient strength recover Those Passions to repell, which did begin Upon my heart at that time to break in: But, ere they were alay'd, an Accident Fell out, which that good issue did prevent; I have so much of common Manliness, (Which might more profit me if it were less) That, all the frailties of the Humane Creature (Co-incident since my depraved Nature) Still so attend me, that do what I can I fall into distemper, now and then; And ere that day was wholly overpast, I, by a sudden accident was cast Into a Passion, which did give occasion Of this ensuing sad Ejaculation. LORD, help me now; assist me now, to bear That, unexpected brunt of Hope and Fear, To which I on a suddain am expos'd, (Whilst other mischiefes have me round inclos'd) For, great and many, though my troubles be They, hitherto have not distemper'd me. But, now I feel my Constancy to shake, My Flesh to tremble, my sad heart so ake, That, if thou dost not speedily apply A Cordial, I may droop, and faint, and die. My Treacherous Flesh and Blood, how false are you! To me, and to your own selves, how untrue! How quickly to revolt do you begin! How cowardly have you my Foe let in At his first summons? how have you conspir'd To give him that advantage he desir'd? And whilst I for your safety did prepare Joyn to surprize me ere I was aware? LORD, let them not prevail; but, help me rally My scattered Forces, and to make a sally On those who my weak Citadel beset: For they have seiz'd but on my Out-works yet, And, if but over me, thou please to hover, (Though at a distance) I shall soon recover. Therefore, at this Assault, for me appear; From me, this Black Cloud, by thy presence, clear; Renew my courage in this day of trouble; Increase my Faith, my former Hope redouble; And let thy Spirit teach me so to pray, That what I shall request, obtain I may. Be likewise pleas'd the chatterings of the Swallow, And mournings of the Turtle, so to hallow; That those things which are now express'd by me, May be both acceptable unto thee, And unto those who hear them not in vain, Though to my private suff'rings they pertain: For peradventure, that which me oretakes Hath partly been permitted for their sakes; That they, by heeding what on them at length May fall, might by my weakness gather strength; For, what is in it self a single Trouble, By circumstances, may be sometimes double. My best Friends peradventure, now will wonder How, I am thus, as with a clap of thunder, Struck suddenly; and my Foes, with a scoff Will Jeer, to see me so soon taken off From my late courage and high Resolution, (Whilst I was putting it in Execution,) When they shall know, that, but concerns my Wife, Which breaks through all the comforts of my life, And thus disorders me: But, when they hear me Ev'n some of them, who at the first will Jeer me, (If they have any Manhood left in them) Shall me of no such levity condemn, As yet they may, when all the circumstances I have declar'd to cure their ignorances: For, one of GOD's choice Prophets, had a Tryal Not much unlike this, of his self-denial, When he (as I do) in his Generation, Bore witness of their great abomination: Which (if ought more) had little more effect, Then I may, at this present day, expect. He (whilst GOD's work he follow'd) to the heart, Was pierced (through his Wife) with sorrows dart. She (as the holy Scripture testifies) Was unto him, as precious as his eyes, The comfort of his life, and far more dear (As I believe) then all things transcient were. And peradventure he had grieved more Then yet I do, had not the day before GOD, both foretold her death, and charg'd him too, Not to bewail the Wife he loved so. What, this to me doth intimate, I shall Forbear to tell now; but, if that befall Which I may fear, it will have an effect, Whose demonstration, I shall not neglect If so long I survive, as to declare That Sequell, for which, it will way prepare. Mean while (since hope hath taken truce with sorrow) For some few dayes, that little time Ile borrow, To make it known, how, by a Pannick dread I am at present, so distempered; And in such sober Language will declare it, Without Hyperboles, that, if men hear it With like sobriety, it will perchance Their edifying in some kind advance. When, I had finished those Meditations Last mention'd (which concern my dear'st Relations As to the world) A messenger of sorrow That very day, (I, looking for, next morrow My Wives arrival) brought, not newes alone That suddain sickness, her had seiz'd upon; But, that, she likewise in a Feaver lies, With which are complicated Maladies Portending death: and Death desired so That, they about her, can with much ado Preserve her life. This newes, as soon as told, Laid instantly, upon me such fast hold, That, er'e I could into my heart retire I seemed to be wholly set on fire: And (being for surprizal, the more fit By what, that day, for better use was writ) Instead of that, which might have quencht the same I snatcht up oil, and threw't into the flame. So frail I am not (though made of such Mettle That I am sometime soft and sometime Britle) As to be shaken meerly with a fear Of things which ev'ry day expected are; But, many sad concomitants attended This Message, not till then so apprehended; For, at that instant every thing prest in Which might a doleful Tragedy begin, With such confusion, that, what entred first I knew not, neither which disturb'd me worst. So that, I nought could call to mind, but that Which my Afflictions, did more aggravate. Imprisonment, I felt not till that day, Wherein I found, that I was kept away, Where, I to her could no assistance give, For, whose sake, I did most desire to live; My Fancie represented to my sight In how disconsolate and sad a plight, She there was left, dispoil'd of all she had, Excepting, what might make her heart more sad. With foes surrounded, not one to befriend her, Not servants in that weakness to attend her, No good Physitian living there about, Scarce any thing within doors, or without, For food or Physick: for, while she had health Her courage did supply her want of Wealth, And all things else, with help, of what from Heaven Was by his providence in all wants given, Who hath been my support; By him alone She hath in many straits been carryed on, And all oppressions with such courage bore As if she had been rich by being poor: Which her despightful neighbours heeding well (And, that she far'd like trodden Camomel) Words unto this effect, were heard to speak Will not, with all this loss, her stout heart break? GOD, was, and still, her helper he will be; But, for all this, what thanks is due to me? What help am I who should a help have been, When such extream Affliction she was in? Dear BETTY, how inhumanly opprest? Art thou? and oh! how is my Soul distrest Now, I here think upon thy high desart, And, how discomfortably left thou art? If it might comfort thee, would thou, didst know (Else not) what tears out of mine eyes do flow: For, I, from whom the worlds despights can strain Nor sighs, nor tears, from tears cannot restrain. Woe's me (my Dear) my life I would resign Might it accepted be, to ransome thine, And were at my dispose; for, cause am I Of that sad plight, wherein thou now dost lie; Since, what the world hath done, is nothing more, Then thou hast alwayes look'd for heretofore. Yet, take it not unkindly; for, to thee No ill was meant, in what was done by me: He, (as I thought) to whom my self I owe, (And, who did thee, and all I had bestow) Requir'd the services that brought upon me That, which to thy undoing, hath undone me; And he will either back again restore What's lost, or give us better things, and more. This, knowing thou believ'st, and dost confide In him, hath much my Passion qualifi'd; And makes me hopeful, GOD, will bring thee hither, Or, me to thee, that, we once more together May praise his Name, and live till we can part, Without the least distemp'rature of heart. Whilst this hope lasts, lest notice being taken That, I with one small puff of wind am shaken; Lest also, this begets a fear in some, That I may totally be overcome, When they perceive, that he, who hath profest So much, hath with so little been opprest; And, lest they also may discourag'd be, (If I sinck under that which lies on me) I will, for that cause, hence occasion take, (Aswell, for their, as for mine, and her sake) So plainly, what befals me to expresse, That, no heart which hath any tenderness, Beseeming men, shall think a greater Tryal Of humane patience, in a self-denial Can ever in the Flesh be undergone, Then this, which they suppose a slender one. I have a just occasion too, by that To render her, that honour in the Gate, Which is her due; and whereto I do stand Obliged by King Lemuels Command; And, from what I expresse, perhaps, likewise, There may some other good effects arise. What could the malice of the Devil invent, To make more grievous my Imprisonment Then at this time, wherein (for ought I know) The last, and needful'st duty that I owe Unto my dearest Friend, ought to be paid, To be unjustly in a Prison staid? Were I detained but from such a one, As many have, (a Wife in name alone) I should be glad perhaps, I now am here, Or, though within a far worse place it were: But, if I may with modesty expresse, What I believe, I can affirm no less Then this; Though many women have done well, Mine, with the best may be a parallel: And, since my pow'r to nothing else extends Which may, for what she suffers make amends, In words, at least, Ile give her what is due And say no more, then I believe is true. Perhaps, when told, it will so far exceed What is according to the common Creed, That, many will suspect it; But, know this There is in that man very much amisse Who, of his consort, doth not so believe In some degree, as I of mine conceive. For, if he finds her not a helpful Wife, Either, for this, or for the other Life; The fault's his own, though she may faulty prove; And he ingratefully requites GOD's Love. GOD gave her not, but, he himself acquir'd her, By some ill means; or, for those ends desir'd her Which make no Marriages, but what are evil, And, were made by the World, Flesh and the Devil. Else, he would honour Providence Divine, By praising of his Wife as I do mine. Or, by confessing freely, as he ought, That, GOD is just, in giving what he sought. Whether mine live or die, let none who hear them Grudge her these praises, for her worth will bear them. At first, I lov'd her, for his sake that gave her; Of him, I sought her, and from him I have her, If she be yet alive, (which I yet hope, And, that he to my fear will put a stop.) That, we each other might affect the better, (And, to be mutual helpers prove the fitter) As EVE from ADAM, GOD did, as it were, First, make her out of me; then, me by her He made more perfect; And since Eve was made No man on earth a fitter helper had. If any woman may Charactred be By Lemuels pattern, I think this is she: For, having oftentimes compared them, Betwixt them, little difference did seem. She is a Prize, worth ev'ry precious stone In India, were all their worths in One. My heart in her hath trusted so, that yet I never, since I knew het, felt a fit Of Jealousie or doubt, in any kinde, Which brought the least distemper to my mind. She, at all times, much good to me hath done, But, evil, in her life time, did me none. With courage, her Affairs she went about By Day; at Night, her Candle went not out. She was among the last, who came to bed; The first, who in the Morning rais'd her head; And, that no duty might be left undone, Martha, and Mary, she still joyn'd in One. In all Domestick Business, she was skil'd, Both in the house, and likewise in the Field: And whilst my time was otherwayes bestown, Dispatch'd both my affaires, and her own. She was no Prodigal, nor basely sparing; All things were done without vexatious caring; She chid those, who (when chiding was in season) Were to be quickned more with noise, then Reason; And, when to angry words they did provoke, Her anger ended, when the words were spoke; When, also, they were griev'd, who did misdo, She pardon'd, and with them, oft, grieved too. All her Affairs, she managing with Reason, Appointed work and meat, in their due Season To ev'ry servant; and good notice took Both of what was well, or Ill done, or spoke. She feared GOD, and honour gave to them Who were invested with a Pow'r Supream; Her life, she squared by GOD's holy Word, According to the Light he did afford; And, had her self so exercis'd therein, That, often she my Concordance hath been; Yea, and in Humane Histories, to me Been in the stead of my MNEMOSYNE. A better Woman, Mistris, Mother, Wife, I never saw, nor shall see during life. Rebecca like, she gave me still to eat Aswell most savory, as wholsom meat; And, when GOD fent me food, good care she took, The Devil should not send me in a Cook. To me, to mine, and our poor neighbourhood, She, in the stead of our Physitian stood; She, still according to her power was ready To give what things were needful to the needy; Who did not wilful Beggarship professe, That, they might live in sorded Idlenese; And, purchasing her own food with her sweat, Abhor'd the bread of Idleness to eat: She could speak well, yet readier was to hear; Exceeding Pleasant, and yet as severe As Cato. Though Corporeal Beauties be Worn out with Age, she is the same to me She was at first, and 'twas no mean perfection, Which, in my Youth, surprized my Affection. This is her Character, and in the word Of Truth, this is thereof, a true record. In her, I did as much contentment find, As if I had enjoy'd all Woman-kind: For, though a poor mans Consort she hath been, She had a spirit might become a Queen; Yet, knowing how to want and to abound, Could make it stoop ev'n to the very ground; And, if she die, I shall but little care For any thing she leaves behind her here, Except her Children, and that which relates To GOD, and to our Spiritual Estates. The deprivation of her company And, of thar joy in her society Which I have had, is far a greater loss, Then, all those many Baubles and that drosse, Whereof the world deprives me; or, of them (Had they heen mine) which others most esteem. This seperation is the great'st despight That malice could have done me at her height; And might we live, where we might live alone To talk of that, which GOD for us hath done, (And means to do) my Joy would be much more With competence, then with the worlds whole store, Were I depriv'd of her; who, might be here So necessary a Remembrancer. Now, Judge (if you or I, do this believe) Whether I had not cause enough to grieve, That we were so, divided from each other, Left hopeless, we again should meet together. Though such in ev'ry point, she may not be, Yet, since that she doth such appear to me; Think, if by fear of loosing such a Prize, A man who is far stronger, and more wise, Might not, when thereby suddenly oretaken As much with like distemp'ratures be shaken: And, whether (taking to consideration The sense I have of ev'ry Humane Passion) Ought may befall, as I am Flesh and Blood, That could more difficultly be withstood. But, notwithstanding what's exprest, let no man Suppose I have forgot she is a Woman. I am not so Uxorious, or unwise, To think that she hath no Infirmities; Or, that to any other she doth seem So worthy as she is in my esteem. The rough hard shells in which rich Pearls do lie, Shew not their Beauty to a strangers eye. And Vertues, when that they most perfect are, Sometimes, like faulty Actions may appear To lookers on, who have not means to know How done, nor to what end, nor whence they flow; And then especially, when their Spectators, Are Envious, or their Foes, or Vertue's haters. The mildest Medicine, sore eyes, diseases, A sickly Stomack wholsom'st meat, displeases; And so the best and noblest Dispositions, Are most dislik'd by men of base Conditions; Because their Vertues, if they neighbours are, Do make their Vices greater to appear. Her precious Balms, have sometimes made me smart, But, I confesse, the cause was on my part, If she administred a bitter pill In love, to make me well, when I was Ill. And well she might sometimes occasion find, To give me wholsome Physick of that kind, By cautions and remembrances apply'd In season, when my wit was foolifi'd: For, nothing purposely, from her I hid That, in my life, I said, or thought, or did. And (that she might, at full, be privy to My whole Affairs, and all I had to do) No Letter unto me in absence came, But leave I gave her to break ope the same. Which freedom (with such) mutually bestown Made me to her, and her to me so known, That, what the outside of my Actions be, My Conscience hardly better knowes then she. Small use of an Affection can be there, Or proofs of Friendship, where no failings are. There's hardly possibility of living, With any one, who never needs forgiving; For, he, who in his Consort, finds no blame, When he fails, will confounded be with shame. By these Expressions, which have shown in part, My Passions, I have somewhat eas'd my heart. And, though impertinent they seem to be To others, they are pertinent to me, In shewing me my weakness, and from whom My helps, in all extremities must come. My Passion is the same; but, this, makes way For Reason, to command, which did obey; And, this Divertisment a stop, brings in To that, which else, might have destructive been. Yet, Instrumental, though my Reason was Herein, th'Efficient is Preventing Grace: And therefore, Him, from whom this Mercy came, I, thus Petition to compleat the same. My God! my heart, thou bast now touched nearly, And dost in that, which I affect most dearly, Begin to try my Faith; That Faith of mine Which (if a true Faith) was a gift of thine; It was by thee, upon my Soul begot: Into Temptation, therefore lead me not Beyond my strength; But LORD deliver me From Evil, that, I may not foiled be: Thy onely Son, to thee, taught me to pray In words to this effect, when any way I was opprest; Compassion therefore take On me, (though not for mine) LORD, for his sake; And me dismisse not, in this sad Condition, Without a kind reply to my Petition: For, as Lot said of Zoar, LORD, the boone I now request is but a little one; And, peradventure, should my foes perceive Thou dost of every comfort him bereave Who hath desir'd to magnifie thy Name, It might occasion give them to blaspheme, Or, make thy servants to begin to Fear That, thou regard'st not how opprest they are. That Helper, which thou didst on me bestow, (And, Whose assistance is much needed now) Thou seem'st to call upon me to resign, As one, who must no longer now be mine. Be not displeased LORD, if I shall say Thou tak'st the comfort of my life away; And that, I do expect thou shouldst not leave me Quite comfortless, if thou of her bereave me. Why dost thou Dictate to my heart this Prayer, If thou intend'st, to leave me in despaire? It cannot be, thou move me shouldst to crave, That, which thou dost not purpose I should have. I do depend on thee, and hazarded Both her, and all that in this world I had For thy Cause, if my heart be not untrue: Though therefore, nothing is by merit due, Vouchsafe, (if with thy will accord it may) Her life with health, and for a longer day, That, we with thankfulness, in praises giving, May shew thy Mercies forth, among the living. With Tokens of thy favour, make us glad, According to the Troubles we have had. And, make thy other servants hopeful be Of that Salvation, which thou shew'st to me. Make it appear unto this Generation That, we have the same GOD, the same Salvation In these our dayes, that was in former times, Aswell, as such like Tyrrannies and Crimes. Make it appear that thou hast love for us Aswell as heretofore for Lazarus; That, thou, who didst hear Hagar for a Son, And, Hannah's Prayer, when she beg'd for one, Dost not despise my Prayer for the life Of my beloved and Afflicted Wise; Or, hast less pitty now then heretofore Thou hadst of other some, who did deplore Their dead or dying Friends; and when they mourn'd, Had them into their bosoms back return'd. Let it be known to those who do begin To think, thou art not that which thou hast been, Because that this Age hath produc'd occasions To shew thy self in other dispensations. Though to run back to Egypt, we are ready; As froward, as Rebellious, and as giddy. As they whom thou broughtst thence; though, every way As false, as faithless, and as apt as they To set up golden Calves: Though, as were then There be among us here, such wicked men As Jannes, and as Jambres, who resist Not Moses, but a greater, JESUS CHRIST; And, strive by their Inchantments how to bring Us back to bondage, and seduce the King By cursed sorceries; yet, make it known; That, thou in Btittain dost a People own: That as when Israel was from Pharoh saved; That, as thou wert with Moses and with David, And with thy People who in thraldom were At Babel, thou art present with us here. (LORD! I beseech thee mind thou not the less My private suit, although my zeal to this Diverts me from it: for, Ile further yet Pursue that, though thou me shouldst quite forget) Apparant make it, that, some yet inherit A Portion of the self same pow'rful Spirit Which fill'd Elias; and if need require, That thou hast Prophets, who can call down Fire, Hail, Thunder-bolts, and other dreadful things Upon the Troops and Armies of those Kings Who Persecute thy Saints; and Heaven constrain Either to let fall, or withhold the Rain, As to thy service it shall appertain! For, this, though, hardly yet believ'd of any, Will shortly be made manifest to many; And thy vouchsafeing this request of mine, May make it, to this Age, perhaps, a signe That, thou, as heretofore, dost lend an ear At need, to every private sufferer, As well as unto Publick Grievances, And, that, when ripen'd are Iniquities A greater Conquest will be got by Words, Then ever was in any Age, by Swords. My Dear Redeemer, if it may be thus, Be pleas'd to Mediate this boon for us. That suit, for which this Prayer was begun I will renew, now this digressions done; Yet, neither this, nor ought else Ile require, (Though rather then my life, I this desire) But, what, with thy Good pleasure may consist: And, thou hast nothing openly exprest To make me doubtful that may not be done; For, then, I therein thus far, had not gone. All, things thou seem'st to will, accord not to That, which thou hast decreed for us to do, As being absolutely necessary: For, some of them are but Probationary: Things, by us, rather to be will'd, then done, As when, to Sacrifice his Onely Son Thou didst command thy servant Abraham; And, when that our obedience is the same, With us, it otherwhile, doth so succeed That, thou the Will, acceptest for the Deed; And, mayst another Sacrifice, this day Accept in her stead, for whom I now Pray. This, moveth Dust and Ashes, now, to do, What Natural Affection prompts me to: Make her and me, so perfectly resign Our selves, that our will, may be one with thine; And, Pardon this bold pleading; for, had we No will, which may be said our own to be, There could be no obedience. Good nor Ill, Can be, in him, that is not free to will. LORD! this my Consort, is as dear to me As Isaac unto Abraham could be; Yet, if thou wilt resume her at this time, (Although with me thou deal not as with him) As absolutely, as he did intend His Sacrifice; I, her to thee commend. From thee I had her; up to thee I give her; I, wholly unto thy disposure leave her; And, whether thou shalt keep, or give her back, Ile wear it as a Favour, for thy sake. And, this is all Ile absolutely crave, (Wherein, I know, I my request shall have) If, with thine honour, it may to her good Conduce, to let her make with me abode A little longer time, that time allow; Or else with all my heart, resume her now. For, save to serve thee, and our Generation, According to the end of our Creation, (And for thy Glory) neither she, nor I (If I do know her) wish to live or die. If, her appointed labour now be done, (And I must here abide to work alone,) Take her into thine Arms before she go; Make her not barely, to believe, but know, That, this our sad and suddain Separation Is for thy Glory, and for our Salvation: (For, from the life and Death of greatest Kings But seldom so much real honour springs To glorifie thy Name, as doth from some Who fill on earth, a despicable Roome.) Give her an earnest, that she shall possesse Thy love, in everlasting happiness; And, that, we, whom she leaves afflicted here, (Continning in our love to thee sincere) Shall by the Mediatorship of him Who bought us, meet at thy appointed time, Where we shall never part; where, Tyrannies, Of others, nor our own Infirmities, Nor any thing which is to come, or past, Deprives, of what for thine, prepar'd thou hast: And, if she live, so let our deeds expresse Whilst here we live, what we in words professe; That others, may, until my dying day Believe ther's truth, in what I write and say. To that end, keep us pleased with our Lot, Though little, much, or nothing shall be got Of what we had; my GOD preserve us too From stumbling, and from reeling to and fro, Or stagg'rings in our Tryals, whereby they Who are in like Afflictions, stagger may: But, with true Joy, so let thy Holy Ghost Replenish us, that, (although all be lost Belonging to this world) thy Saints may see That, there is All-sufficiency in thee. Now, live or die my DEAR, GOD's will be done; He fills my heart, and my Distemper's gone. Since, GOD hath freed me from this Carnal Fear, Let World, and Devil henceforth do what they dare. The greater weights they shall upon me lay, The sooner, I from them shall scape away. If, me, they shall into a Dungeon throw, Both dark and deep, that none may come to know What, I say, think or do; yet, what's done there, By these my Scraps and Crums, it will appear, Though scribled hastily, yea, help prevent What, peradventure, is the Worlds intent: And hint, that, though Close-Prisoner me they keep, I shall not wholly spend my time in sleep. For, doubtless, to my GOD, there, speak I shall Like Jonas, in the Belly of a Whale, And (as the Blood of Abel dld) speake then, That, which will more prevaile then Tongue or Pen. Isaiah 38. The living, The living (O GOD) shall praise thee as I do this day. (YET) Blessed are they who die in the LORD; for they shall rest from their Labours, and their works follow them. Revel. 14. 13. Octob. 6. 1661. Another Spiritual Song composed, by occasion of the last mentioned Distemper. I VVhen in the Morn we rise, Alas! how little think we on, What through our ears or eyes, May pierce our hearts, ere that day's gone? I, did but borrow From what, next Morrow, I hop'd to have enjoy'd; And that, hath quite The whole delight Of both dayes, now destroy'd. II My thoughtful heart grew sad, And represented unto me, Such things as in the shade Of Death's approaches use to be: With many a doubt, (Which Faith keeps out) My Fancy fills my head; And clouds are come, Which with a Gloome This day, have overspread. III If, whilst the Sun gives light, Become so dark, so soon, it may, How black will be the Night That shall ensue so dark a day? My Soul, I see Betray'd we be, By our own want of care, To have prepar'd A dayly guard, To keep out carnal Fear. IV No pow'r was in the World Whereby a Passion like to this, On me could have been hurl'd, Had nought, been in my self amisse: By day or night, (Be't black or bright) The Devil hath no power Which can procure Distemp'rature, Without some fault of our. V How frail a thing is man, That, lifeless words, aray'd in white, This Morn affright him can Who, seemed fearless yester night? Dread of ill newes, Too plainly shews That, with us all's not well: For, if it were We need not Fear, Though storm'd by Death and Hell. VI For, if beneath GOD's Wing Our safe repose we sought to make, None, such Ill newes could bring, That, much our Courage it could shake; Of, Plagues that smite By day or night We need not stand in awe Of poysonous things, Of Serpents stings, Nor of the Lyons Pawe. VII Therefore, my Spirit rowze (Our Foes, we see, are not asleep) Let us, no longer drowze, But, better watch hereafter keep; Come, Courage take, And we shall make These Bugg-bears take their flight? For, 'tis our Fear, No strength of their That now doth us affright. VIII The Passions of the mind Are but the fumes of Flesh and Blood, Which make the Reason blind, By mispresenting Ill, or Good. If, unto these, We closly presse, And, wistly on them look, They will appear Such as they are, And, pass away like smoke. IX And, yet, my Soul, beware Thou bring not to assault these Foes Goliah's shield or Spear, Nor in his Head-piece trust repose. No, nor unto What Self can do, But, take thou Davids sling, And, what he took Out of the Brook, Of Grace, among them fling. A Meditation whilst he was taking a Pipe of Tobbacco. Though some, perhaps will think the things I do, Much less then Idleness, amount unto; Yet, to have no work troubles me, at least, As much, as therewith to be overprest; And, then to be quite Idle, I had rather Pick strawes, catch Flies, or shells, and Pebles gather, Or, (as I sometimes do) the time to pass, Number my steps, or tell the panes of glass, And often when a trifling act is done, Make some good use of that, which promis'd none. Here, all alone, I by my self have took, An Emblem of my Self, a Pipe of Smoke: For, I am but a little piece of Clay Fill'd with a Smoke that quickly fumes away. This Vanity, our Clymat never knew Till near the time, in which, first breath I drew; And otherwhile, it is of wholsome use (Though, for the most part subject to abuse:) Since first I smookt it, after (it came hither) I laid it by, nigh thirty years together, And for my healths sake, then, did reassume That Bauble wherewith we Tobbacco fume; (Not hitherto disabled to forgo it, If any way offensive I should know it) And, that in mind, as well as bodily I might he someway profited thereby, Such Meditations come into my thought, As these, which now, unto my mind are brought. Ev'n as this Pipe was formed out of Clay, And may be shapeless Earth again this day, So may I too. So brittle, that one touch May break it, this is; I, am also such. When it is broke, made whole it cannot be By Humane Art; so will it fare with me When I to dust shall be reduc'd by Death, Until reviv'd by an Eternal Breath. This brittle ware, we, oft have strangely seen Preserv'd from breaking: and so I have been. When foul it growes, it must be purifi'd, By Fire; I, in like manner must abide Those Fiery-Tryals, which will purge away That filth which is contracted every day. Moreover, when therein, this Herb's calcin'd, Such things as these, it brings into mind; That Custom, by degrees, prevaileth still, To draw us, both to what is Good and Ill; For, when this customarily is taken, It can by very few, be quite forsaken, Or, heeded, how they turn unto abuse, That, which is otherwise, of some good use; Yea, so it them deludes, that oft they think That, is well scented, which doth alway stink; Yet, me it makes, with thankfulness to heed, How, GOD wraps up, a Blessing in a Weed: And, how (when I have weighed things together) He makes one vanity to cure another; Turns that to Good, which was, perhaps, for Evil, At first, sent in among us, by the Devil. It minds me too, that, as this Herb by fire Must be consum'd, so, must all our desire Of Earthly things; and, that wherein we took Most pleasure, turn to Ashes and to Smoke. When I had writ thus much, of what I thought, My Candle, and Tobbacco were burnt out. A Hint, of that, which may hereafter (if not despised) conduce to the Setling of Peace and Concord in Church and State. This Scrap, though some will not disgest, Is cast in here, among the rest. Elia's like, I thought my self alone, A while ago, and of my mind, knew none: But, many I now hope, here living be Who, joyn in one Faith, and one love with me. My Soul, I long time, seemed to possess, As when the Baptist in the Wilderness Was to be Disciplin'd, and there prepar'd For, that, which he performed afterward. As when he Preach'd Repentance, in his dayes, High Priests, nor Lawyers, Scribes nor Pharisees, Nor of the gay Herodians, any one (Nor many, but the Vulgar sort alone) Regarded it; so, likewise, I might say Of all my Premonitions, to this day; And may (for ought I know) without regard Pursue my Work, till I have his reward: If so it happen, I am well content To follow such a holy Precedent. I, am now (as it were) one in exile, Like John, when banish'd into Pathmos Isle; And, to the seven Churches in these Nations As he then, to the Asian Congregations Had somewhat to expresse; so, I from HIM (As I believe) who sent his mind to them By that Disciple, have a needful Errant, To be delivered, by Authentick Warrant, Which, must lie Dormant, until them to hear it GOD, shall prepare, and fit me to declare it. Mean while, I cast in this Preoccupation, To be a furtherance to that Preparation Whereto GOD's Grace will ripen me, and Them, (Hereafter, in his own appointed time; If nothing that shall be Co-incedent Doth intervene, that purpose to prevent) Thus Christ, did to a future time adjourn What, he had then spoke, might it have been born; And, his example doth instruct my Reason, To chuse for every work, a proper Season. I have a Love for all the whole Creation, Much more, for every Christian Congregation: I, for each Member of them (whatsoere Infirmities, I see in them appear) Have such a Love, and so inlarged, that I can with every Church Communicate, In all Essential duties, though they may Be sometimes, much abus'd with an Allay: Because, what me therein offendeth, I, Without offending others, can pass by; And, at another time, in private, seek To make them understand what I dislike; And, by a meek compliance in what's good, Bear with a failing, not well understood. Their Ignorance, or misled Consciences, Give me no cause of Personal offences, So, they the Fundamental Truths, profess Without malicious minds, or wilfulness; Or by approving, or continuing in Prophanness, and committing open Sin. For, since he that knows most, knows but in part And, hath a Cloudy Region in his heart, They, of my Pitty, rather Objects be Then of my hate. They, so much hurt not me As damnifie themselves: And, I, thereby Have of my Meekness, Faith and Charity, Those Exercises, for which (if I have them In true sincerity) GOD, chiefly gave them. And, which way can they better be employ'd Then, that a common good may be enjoy'd? And that we to our Brethren may extend That mercy, when we think they do offend, Which GOD's long suffering doth vouchsafe to us? And, since he did command it should be thus? The Church Catholick, is a Corporation, Whereof, the several Churches in each Nation Are Bodies Corporate, as here we see In LONDON, many Corporations be Members thereof distinct, govern'd by Laws Peculiar to themselves, as they found cause To constitute them; yet, unto all these Belong the Cities gen'ral Priviledges; And every Individual Person; there, Conforms unto those Lawes which proper are To this whole City; and they live together In Peace, without intruding on each other. What hinders (but our Ignorance, Ambition, Our Avarice, and Love to Superstition,) That, Christian Congregations may not thus Be form'd, and regulated so with us, That, we may live henceforward in true Peace, Morality and Piety increase? Prophanness be supprest? and, no more, here, Affairs Divine, and Civil interfere? What hinders this, but, want of that true Love And meeknes, which our knowledge might improve? And, whence flowes Discord, but from intermedling With what concerns us not? fooling, and Fidling About those things impertinent, which, whether Their tendance be to this, or that, or neither 'Tis not material, so, that may not be Infringed, which to all, ought to be free? That Peace may be preserv'd; men kept in awe From violating of the morall Law, And, GOD permitted to possesse alone The Conscience as (on earth) his Proper Throne? For, he from none, will an account receive, According to what other men believe, Or shall command; but, answerable to What he commands us to believe and do, According to the Light he shall afford, By his assisting Spirit, and his Word: And, therefore, they, who, out of slavish Fear, Of those who peaceably inclined are, Force Innocents, to any hard Condition (Thereby to free themselves from their Suspition Which is incurable) are Tyrannous, And foes to GOD, unto themselves, and us. In my late Tryal, I have had a shake, But, it hath deeper driven in the stake; And hath, I hope vouchsafed by that FIT, An earnest, he so fast will settle it; That, all the Tempests which in future dayes The World, the Flesh and Devil have pow'r to raise, Shall more increase my courage; and, by mine Some other, to the like Resolves incline. GOD, give us Grace, with seriousness to heed These things in time, with what, else may succeed. There is a way, how that, may yet be done Which hitherto, is little thought upon; And, thereof, in what is expressed here, A Hint, if well observed, may appear. A Hymn of Thanksgiving to Almighty GOD; compos'd by this Prisoner, for the gracious restoration of his Wives life and health; who, lying mortally sick (as was supposed) at 52. miles distance during his Imprisonment, in a sad disconsolate condition, and reputed to be dead, about the space of an hour, was miraculously restored. To the Tune of the 148. Psalm. I How soon, my gracious GOD, Hast thou my Prayer heard? How just, how kind, how Good, Hast thou to me appear'd? Blest, be this Day: For, what did fright my heart last night, Thou dost allay: The Clouds, that made, this Morning sad, Are blown away. II As when his moan to thee The good Centurian made, Though I unworthy be, Like favour I have had Vouchsaf'd to me; Nay little less, in my distress Receiv'd I have, Then She, whose Son, and onely one, Was near his grave. III At least, I, so much Grace Of thee, this day have had, As daign'd to Jairus was Whose Daughter thou foundst dead, Upon her Bed: For, when my Wife, depriv'd of life Had long time laine, Thou, heeding there, our Prayers here Gav'st life again. IV Thus she, who first was thine (And so shall alwayes be) Hath now, been twice made mine, And, is enjoy'd by me; For which, to thee A double praise, LORD, all my dayes, I ought to give; Assist I pray, this due to pay Whilst here I live. V And, let all, who now hear What, thou for me hast done, Help me thy praise declare; For, not to me alone Extends this boone; This Act of Grace, vouchsafed was That, they thereby Might at their need, know where to speed As well as I. VI LORD, I have nought to give For all thou hast bestown, But, what I did receive And was, and is thine own; Oh! now therefore This Sacrifice, do not despise For, I am poor; Therewith, I shall give self and all, Who can give more? A Penitential Hymn, composed by occasion of a Dream the 19th. of Octob. 1661. about Midnight. I My GOD, thou didst awake me, This night out of a sad and fearful Dream, That, sensible did make me Of Sins, which heretofore small Sins did seem; And, ere I perfect heed could take, Whether I slept, or was awake, He, that is watching ev'ry hour, Whom he may mischief, and devour, Sought, how he might thereby advantage make: Rebuke him, for my Dear Redeemer's sake. II Permit thou no Transgression, Whereof, I heretofore have guilty been, Nor great, nor small Omission, Which I forgotten have, or overseen, (Either through want of penitence Or of confessing my offence) To rise against me, great or small; For, LORD, I do repent them all: And, likewise, (be it more or less) Renounce all trust, in my own Righteousness. III As Job, complain'd, such Visions To me seem'd represented this last night Of failings, and Omissions That, sleeping, they did much my heart affright; Me thought a Spirit passed by Not to be seen with mortal eye; And, I was minded by a Voice (That, spake unto me without noise) Of things preceding, which (then quite forgot) So, as I ought to do, I heeded not. IV Oh God! most kind, most holy, Remember not the errours of my life; Call not to minde my folly To add a new Affliction, to my Grief. World, Flesh and Devil, my foes are, And, much more then my strength On me, they have already cast, (can bear Unless, that thou compassion hast; Oh! throw my sins out of thy sight therefore, That, they may not be seen, or heard of more. V My Soul doth now abhor them, Thine onely Son, hath with his precious blood Made satisfaction for them; Thou, didst accept it; I believe it good: And, therefore, though they somtimes make My heart to tremble and to ake, My Soul is confident they pard'ned are As if they ne're committed were; Confirm it so, that, sleeping and awake Sweet rest in thee, I may for ever take. VI Dear GOD, of my Salvation, Preserve me by thy Love and mighty Pow'r From perilous Temptation, In Weal, in Woe, and at my dying hour: Me, let thy Gardian Angels keep When I do wake, and while I sleep, From shame without, and fear within: From evil thoughts, and Actual Sin, That, Friends and Foes and every one may see, No man in vain, doth put his trust in thee. A Requiem to the Soul. I My Soul, vex not thy self at those, Who, to all Godliness are Foes, Although they make fair outward showes, And spread and flourish like the Bay; For, deplorable is their case, They, as the scorched Summer Grasse, Shall soon into oblivion passe, And all their Beauty fade away. II I have been young, and old am grown And, many changes I have known, Whereby, it hath to me been shown Whereto, their wicked courses tend: With Honour I have seen them Crown'd, With Pow'r and Riches to abound, Whose Place no where can now be found; For, all their Pomp is at an end. III With shadows they themselves beguile, And, GOd, doth at their folly smile; With patience therefore wait a while, And, grudge them not their Portion, here; Destruction, toward them is hasting, Their Time is short, and dayly wasting, But, thine will be for everlasting, And, Griefs, as if they never were. IV Employ thy self in doing well, And, GOD, with thee shall kindly deal; Thou, in the Land shalt safely dwell, Well fed and clothed, all thy dayes. And when the Glory of their Name Is blur'd out, with an evil Fame, Then, shall thy Poverty and shame Be mention'd unto thy praise. V Let wordlings feed upon their Chaff, Their Cups of Fornication quaff, And at thy sufferings grin and laugh; A midst thy Foes lie down and sleep. Whilst in their malice, they persist, In GOD's Protection take thy rest, For, though thy Body be opprest Thee, safe, in spight of them, he'l keep. He, whosoever he be, that speaks this Charm, Unto his Soul in Faith, shall have no harm; Therefore, as a Receipt approved, take it: For, for my self alone, I did not make it. A Meditation upon the many Prodigies and Apparitions, which are mentioned by Publick writing, or common Fame. VVe are inform'd, by questionless Presages (Vouchsafed to instruct succeeding Ages) That warnings of Christ's coming, should be given By signs and wonders manifest from Heaven: And, we have seen, in Histories recorded, That, Providence, in all times hath afforded, Some Premotions of those Desolations Which fell on Persons, Places, States and Nations, Before they came: For, our most gracious GOD, (As doth a loving Father) shewes the Rod Before he whips, that he thereby may fright To Penitence, ere he begins to smite; And, frequently, prevail, if that means may, Us to reclaim, he flings the Rod away: Which kind Indulgence, is in these times, more Inlarged then, it hath been heretofore. New Prodigies, we hear of ev'ry day, And, likewise hear, how they are puft away As but meer Fictions. If we find them so, This, justly, thereupon inferr I do, That, more presumptuous we in these times are Then ever any other People were: For, very much corruption it implies To be in those who make and publish Lyes. If there be Truth, in any of those Visions, Or Extraordinary Apparitions, Which are affirm'd; 'Tis no less wicked daring, So to affront GOD's visible appearing In Signs and Wonders, as, both to contemn, And seek by all means, how to smother them: But, it is worst of all, to publish Lyes Of purpose, to discredit Verities, As if we meant, to do the most we can To try the Patience both of GOD, and Man. If, we believe the things that are aver'd, Why of GOD's Judgements, are we not afeard? And, either seek to pacifie his Wrath, Or, magnfie his Mercy, who, so hath Forewarn'd, of what is likely to ensue, That, we his Indignation may eschew? If we suspect, what publickly is told, Why do not they, who are in Pow'r (and should) Search out the Truth, that, by due punishment, They such like Provocations may prevent? For, out of question, to connive at Lyes, Or smother Truths, worse things presignifies, Then all the Apparitions, that have been These twenty years, in this our Climate seen; (Though nothing doubted of) and will go nigh At last, to turn all Truths into a Lye. I must confess, that, though unto my Ears There have been brought within these twenty years So many strange Reports, of sights and Voices, Earthquakes and Thunders, dreadful Storms &amp; noises; Of Ebbs and Tides, of Suns, and Moons, and Stars, And Armies in the Clouds, portending Wars, With such like, as would have perhaps, amounted Unto a hundted, if I them had counted; Not one of those I saw: yet, so unjust I am not, as those good men to distrust Who have aver'd them: for, though Prodigies And such miraculous Appearances, Are daign'd in chief, to Infidels, and those Who in God's word, no confidence repose; Yet, they are likewise, otherwhile, reveal'd To true Believers, lest, they be conceal'd From those whom they concern; or lest, by them Quite slieghted, who, the Works of GOD, contemn; They, also their own welfare so neglect That, they be totally without effect. On trust, I therefore take them: for, if we Confirmed by their Witness may not be, Whose Conversations are to us well kuown; How, can we any Affirmations own For Truths, Historically writ, by those Whose Conversation, no man living knowes? For, my part I have with my carnal Eyes, And, otherwise, beheld such Prodigies In Words and Deeds, that, although none of that Were true, which I hear other men relate, I (at the least Mysteriously) discover All those old Miracles, new acted over, In my time, which in Pharaohs days were wrought, When Israel out of servitude was brought; And, many a such like wonderful proceed, As we recorded in the Scriptures read. I've seen th'Inchanter's (yea, and Aarons) Rod, Turn'd into Serpents; Waters into blood. I have seen Froggs sent, and remov'd again, And, yet, we as hard hearted still remain. I have observed, (at least once or twice) Our Dust, to be transformed into Lice. Plagues, which resembled Locusts, Flies, and Hail, Yet not a jot upon our hearts, prevail. The People, ev'n as Murrains do our Beasts, A Sin that's Epidemical, infests; And, so with Blaines and Byles we smitten be, That, in a moral sense, meer Scabs we be. Ægyptian Darkness too, hath here, among Our other Plagues, continu'd very long, With likelihood to be as grosse, as there, Unless, the Sun of Righteousness appear; Yea, I have seen our First-born also slain, Yet, still, we in obduracy remain. I, therefore, wonder not, if private Visions, Prodigeous sights, and Dreadful Apparitions, (Discern'd but here &amp; there) have nought effected, Since, things more Signal, are so much neglected. Where, Moses and the Prophets are not heard, One from the Dead, will find but small regard. In vain are Dumb-shewes, where, a speaking sign Can to no heedfulness, mens hearts incline. When CHRIST's own Words, will not with credit pass, In vain, will be the speakings of an Asse: Yet, speak must, when GOD shall his tongue untie; pass, And, whatsoere succeedeth, so will I. A Riddle for Recreation, not impertinent to this Place. Into a Park, I lately came, Wherein are many herds of Game, Whereof the Keepers take no care, And yet, they in abundance are. They are a Cattle of strange Breed Which, on no Browse, nor Grasse do feed; Are Found, before that they are sought; Aswell in sleep, as waking caught: So silently, they hunted are That, neither Hound nor Horn we hear When chatc't: They, are the onely things, Left free for Beggars and for Kings To Hunt at will: and, all that we Assur'd of by our Charters be. What Park is this? What Game are these? Tell me, and Hunt there, when you please. A Proclamation made by this Prisoner, with the advise of his Privy Counsel, the Muses. Oh Yee's, Oh Yee's, Oh Yee's: if any man In Country, Court or City tell me can Where my last Poem call'd Vox Vulgi lies, (Seiz'd lately in my Chamber by surprize) On penalty, of what else follow may, Let him produce it, e're my Tryal day; (Which, yet, I am not certain, when, or where It will be, neither do I greatly care.) He, who to me, the same will timely bring, Shall be rewarded: So, GOD Save the King. Given, this 17th. of the 8th. Month, 1661. At my Head Qquarters in Newgate, which is, at present, all the places of abode upon earth, which the Prince of this World and his Prelacie have left me. Geo. Wither. A Concluding Epigram. VVith these Cards, I, an After-game have play'd, But, there's one Card, by shuffling, so mislaid, That, now my fore-game's lost; yet, if I may Just Dealing find, Fair Gamsters, and Fair-play, What ever happens, I no question make But, I at last, may thereby save my stake; And, when the Sett is ended, win much more Then ere I got by Play, or Work before. If any good Effects, hereby ensue, A Thanks to GOD, is for my Troubles due: For, had he not made way to send me hither, These Fragments, had not thus been scrap'd together. Those Papers, which are hitherto supprest, Shall that occasion, which will manifest (At last) a more effectual operation Then, if they might have had free Publication. If, also, God, me, here shall exercise With greater Tryals, better Fruits then these They will produce: Therefore, they shall to me Be welcome, when, or whatsoere they be. Yet, for the sakes of other men, well pleas'd I should be, from my Tronbles to be eas'd; Because, until mine shall have some redresse, Their suff'rings, are not likely to be lesse. LORD, therefore, if thou please, make it a sign, Their Troubles will soon end, by ending mine. I, thereof, am a little hopeful made, By some foretokens, which I newly had. Three likely signs thereof, he daigned hath; For, my Beloved Consort, he from death, Was pleas'd to raise (ev'n whilst within this place I have remain'd, exposed to disgrace And Poverty) he, for my Children too, Whilst this was writing, hath provided so That, without Portions, to their good content, They married are, without disparagement; All parties, Christian confidence professing Of their dependance on GOD's future blessing. He, in the presence, and amidst my Foes, Hath spread my Table; and, such bounty showes, That, these are nothing, but the Scraps and Crums Of that supply, which, dayly, from him comes. Appello DEUM, REGEM, POPULUM, PARLIAMENTUM. I do, appeal, to judge of my intent, To GOD, King, People, and the Parliament: For, one of these, I'm sure, my Friend will be, And, I hope well, of all the other three; But, they know not my heart, so well as he. A Post-script to the Readers. To write no more, I long since did intend; But, none but GOD knowes now when I shall end, For, still, I find, when I think all is done, As much to write, as when I first begun. Your true Friend, and Brother in the best Consanguinity, who thinks it no dishonour, to subscribe himself, GEORGE WITHER, of Newgate, in the City of London, Prisoner. The 19th. of the 8th. Moneth, 1661. An Appendix in Relation to what concerns his Wife. My Consort, (who still meanes what ere she sayes) Perusing what's here mentioned to her praise; Protests, her modesty it so offended, To find her self in such a strain commended, That, shees asham'd to live, and, to be dead Had rather, then to see it published. To be aveng'd for this dislike, therefore Ile to the rest, ad this one Vertue more, Which had been else forgot; and if she do Therewith find fault, Ile then, ad twenty moe. For, I forbore her Praises till I fear'd That, them, she never should have seen, or heard, And, had exposed them to Publication Before I was quite cured, of my Passion. THE END. The Authors Dream, the night before the Imprinting of this Book, and (as he believes) the true Interpretation thereof. I am awake: GOD's blessed Name be prais'd, That, he to see the Light, my eyes hath rais'd: For, sleep, I see, which we repute the best Of Temporal things pertaining to mans Rest, (Next to a quiet Conscience) may become A Torment, very near as troublesome, If he, that giveth his Beloved sleep, Did not, within a Bound, nights terrours keep. My Soul, so toyl'd, and tired out, hath been With what, this night, in Dreamings I have seen, That, peradventure, if I waking, had Been so opprest, it might have made me mad: For, from the twelfth hour, to the fourth, well nigh, I have been strugling, in an Agonie, With such Confusions, that, if I would tell How, I have been turmoyl'd, I, might aswell Another World endeavour to Create Out of a Chaos, as the same relate: And, not a littie troubled is my mind, Now I am waking, how, I forth may find What it presignifies: For, I believe Those Notions, I did not in vain receive: And, therefore, (since no Daniel I do know, Who, either can to me my Vision show, Or, what it means) Ile, by GOD's Grace, assay To make the best use of it, that I may; Not doubting, but, that he will condescend To shew some glimpse, of what, he doth intend. It hapned (which, forget not to remember) The day before the Kalend's of November, The first year (and may be the last) wherein I had infranchised in Newgate been, For off'ring to Record, what I have heard By common Fame, and, was by me declar'd To no worse end, then, that, prevent it might Such like Confusions, as me thought, this night To me were represented. And, who knowes But, that, this Dream, a Consequent foreshowes To that relating, which, fulfill'd will be Either, upon these Nations, or on me, Or both of us, if God, averts not from The best of us, that, which is like to come; And, as dreadful our waking Dreams may be As this was in my sleep, last night to me. This very day, moreover, (as I hear) Those Musings, which by me composed were Since my Commitment hither, pass the Presse; And, our Confusions, will be more or less, As they shall take effect. GOD's Will be done, (What ere, he pleaseth shall succeed thereon) For, he, who wak'd me out of this sad Dream, Will, when, at their worst, raise me out of them; Or, when the Resurrection morning comes, Save, me, at least, from all destructive Dooms, This, (though my Dream admits no explanation) I take to be a true Interpretation. But if, that any finds me out a better I will approve it, and remain his debter. Tuba-Pacifica. Seasonable Præcautions, whereby is sounded forth a Re-Treat from the War intended between England and the United-Provinces of Lower GERMANY. By GEO: WITHER, a Lover of Peace, and heartily well-affected toward both Nations. Nimis Cautela non nocet. Blessed are the Peace-makers, for they shall be called the Children of God Matthew 5. 9. TUBA-PACIFICA. Sounding a Retreat from the War intended between England and the United Provinces. An Ancient Emblem, relating to the said Nations. Si Collidimur frangimur, If we knock, we are broke. An hour is come, in which must be renew'd That Work, which I have hitherto pursude; And, I to utter what I have to say, Will take the Kue that's offer'd whilst I may, In hope that they, whose Prudence can descern Those things which their well-being do concern, Will hear and heed them, e're it be so late That Premonitious will be out of date: For, Opportunities may slip away To morrow, which are offer'd us this day; And 'tis all one to Wise-men, whether Strangers Or Friends, premonish them of likely dangers, Or, whether unto them, Alarums from A Silver, or a Rams-horn Trumpet come. To me there are but two wayes known, by which Men may speed well or ill, grow poor or rich; To wit, by prosecuting Good or Evil, By cleaving close to God, or to the Devil And, they are two such Masterships, that, neither Is pleas'd with him, who serves them both together; Because, what is endeavour'd for the one Obstructs what for the other shall be done. Presuming therefore, you depend alone On him, whom I serve, thus proceed I on. A common Fame Reports there will be War Betwixt the English and the Hollander And, by their preparations, I conceive We may with probability, believe It will be so. Their many panick Fears, Their groundless hopes, their bitter Scoffs and Jeers, Cast on each other, are plain symptoms too, Of what, in likelihood, they mean to do. We likewise, by the Truths and by the Lies Which to divide them wicked men devise, And, whereby such Partakers on both sides Augment that hatred which still more divides, May fear, as well as by their other deeds, The mischief will go on, as it proceeds, Untill the power doth rest in GOD alone, To undo, what is wilfully misdone. But, that, which most confirms it, is the sin, The Crying Crimes, that both continue in Without Repentance: For, among the rest These I enumerate are not the least, (Nor any whit abated, since GOD made The late Breach up, which them else ruin'd had) Such, as their bragging vaunts of that frail strength Which will destroy their foolish hopes at length; The confidence, the sottish vulgar gathers From Ships and Armies, long hair, Muffs &amp; Feathers; Their hot contestings which shall have the hap To wear the greatest Bauble in their Cap. Or, whether 'twill at last, be brought to pass, That th'Asse shall ride the Man, or Man the Asse. These, and some other things, that are perceiv'd Now acting, or about to be contriv'd, Have made me, with small diffidence to deem Most of them are as mad as they do seem. And, is it even so? must you now lash Each other, and your earthen Pitchers dash? Must you, that have so long been Friends, now knock Untill you into Potsherds quite are broke? None taking heed or care how to prevent That mischief which appeareth eminent, And was presag'd about the ninetieth year Now past, by this your well known Emblem here? Have you not one among you, rich or poor, So wise as he, whose Counsel heretofore Preserv'd a City, and did then receive The same reward, which men in this age give For such-like services? Hath neither, place A man so prudent as that Woman was Who rais'd the siege from Abel, by her wit, When Joab with an hoast beleagur'd it? But, are you all of wisdom so bereft, That, no Expedient seemeth to be left Whereby to act untill the sequels are Ignoble Peace, or a destructive war? If it be so, from whence could it proceed But from your failings both in word and deed? From sordid Avarice, Pride, and Self-will, Inticing Fleshly Lustings to fulfil? For, these deprave the Judgments of most Nations; Cause them to fall away from their Foundations; Then, fly to Refuges patcht up with Lies, Seek Power and Riches by those vanities Which multiply Oppressions and increase Confusions to the ruine of that Peace They might enjoy: For, then their strength consists In, and by those corrupting Interests, Which will ingage them to rush further on In their Oppressive ways long since begun, Till they grow deaf to all that can be said To make them of their just deserts afraid. And should they then, their crooked paths forbear, Most private Tradings at a non-plus were; Yea all those Incomes whereupon depend Their Formal Grandeur would soon have an end. For, many thousands, who did vast Estates Get and uphold, by cherishing Debates, By multiplying and delaying long Vexatious suits, to many a poor mans wrong, Would think themselves undone, if ev'ry State Their Courts of Justice should reduce to that For which they were ordain'd; and Tyranny Would want fit Tools to bring to slavery The common people. Very few know how They may to GOD and their Superiours now Perform their duties, and not both displease Or th'one or th'other; For, what is by these Commanded, is not seldom, either quite Repugnant, or obliquely opposite, As they Interpretations of them make Who to be Judges of them undertake. Yea, those Professions, and those Trades whereby Most live, are subject to such vanity That honest men are difficultly able To use them with a Consence warrantable. It is no easie matter to devise What would become of all those Butter-flies Who flutter up and down in Princes Courts, If their oppressive Projects of all sorts Were took away; and what case were they in Who at this day do live upon the sin Of one another? But they'l be supply'd What ever to the Publick shall betide; And at the last, (although their Friends they seem) Destroy those Governments that nourish'd them, Unless, according to what's just and true Themselves they modulize, with speed, anew; Which, how, and by whom, that might well be done Were an Expedient worthy muzing on. Perhaps, if you did seriously take heed, How this concerns you, and what would proceed From such a Constitution, you might know From whence the quarrellings between you flow, And how to reconcile those differences Which now increase your dangers and expences. Perceive you not, that your Prevarications, Your Falshoods, and your gross dissimulations With GOD, and with each other, so provokes His anger, who on all mens actions looks, That 'tis impossible you should have Peace With him, your selves or others, till you cease From provocations, and bring forth such fruit As with a real Reformation suit, And with those Churches which are truly Christs? Yea, that your hopes wil fail, though flattering Priests Do promise peace, and impudently, too, Perswade, that GOD is pleas'd with what you do? Observe you may, by what ensues thereon, How, GOD abominates what is misdone In managing the Mysteries of State, And heeds what is in secret aimed at By fair pretendings; and how, they thereby So long have fought themselves to fortifie That, most men are inclined to believe Lest Good is meant, when sweetest words they give; And that they have forgot on what conditions Or, to what end God gave them their Commissions. Know you not, that a spirit of delusion, To bring upon you merited confusion, Was Licensed to go forth and delude Those Prophets, by whose counsel are pursu'd Unrighteous Actions, that you may be sent On Voyages like that which Ahab went? Are your eyes wholly blinded? heed you not That, such another Spirit is begot 'Twixt you, and 'twixt the People ev'ry where Within your several Borders, here and there, (And at this time as active) as was that Which GOD permitted to infatuate Abimelech and Sichem, till it had Destroy'd them; all their Counsels frustrate made, And brought upon both Parties that reward Which for blood-thirsty persons is prepar'd? If these things you have heeded, be not still By those deluded who intend you ill; But, wake out of your deep security, And from that Trance wherein you seem to lie. Consider seriously, what you intend; E're it begin, think well how it may end; What an intollerable heavy load 'Twill lay on most at home, on some abroad, What Treasure, and how much blood will be spent; How, both your Countries will be thereby rent And shatter'd; beside, what not yet fore-seen, Is likewise possible to intervene, From them, who watching to enjoy the spoil By your contendings, laugh and jeer meanwhile; Which to prevent, I found out this Retreat From that War, wherewith you each other threat. I nothing aim at, or design to do But what I know GOD hath inclin'd me to, And which you too, may know, if you well weigh What I have written, with what I might say; And, I believe, that man (who ere he be) Who shall obstruct what's offer'd now by me Shall thereby suffer as one who withstands The mercy he intendeth to both Lands. With nought I charge you, but what th'one or th'other Is singly guilty of, or both together; Nor ought whereto, unless you feared are, You in your selves a witness do not bear: For my part, I shall neither gain nor loose By Peace or War, or by that which ensues; Because, he that on GOD his whole heart sets, Will be the same, what ever he permits. I love both Nations, truly wish them well, And therefore shall not any thing conceal That may concern your safety, though with scorn My Premonitions you should back return: Permit me then, to speak a word in season; For, sometimes, he that is a Fool speaks reason. Though Joseph was a slave in deep disgrace; A Prisoner more neglected then I was In my late Thraldome; (no whit less in danger By false Accusers, because, more a stranger;) A heathen King, disdained not to take Good Counsel from him, when he reason spake Though he in him, no more of GOD could see At first, then you at this time do in me. I, no such Revelations will pretend As give no warrant on them to depend Save his own word who tells them; neither ought Advise, but Truths, which GOD himself hath taught As well to you as me, by his known word, Or by the Olive-branch, or, by the Sword. His Justice or his Mercy; which have spoke That oft, whereof you little heed have took. To fright you, no predictions I will fain As many do, pumpt out of their own brain; Nor speak in Riddles, nor such things declare As you cannot without crakt patience hear, If I may but that freedom have to speak, Which harmless Fools, and licens'd Jesters take. As Moses, from a principle of Love Said unto those two Israelites who strove, So say I unto you who disagree; Wrong not each other, for, you Brethren be By Nature; yea, by Grace too, so profest: Be therefore Christians, or be men at least. Like barbrous heathen wherefore should you strive, And by dissention to your selves derive A mutual Plague? Act that which is design'd By them who to destroy you are inclin'd, And, probably, can no way else effect That mischief which their Malice doth project? Consider what Advantages you had By concord, how safe thereby you were made; What you profest when you agreed together; VVhat heretofore, you have been to each other; How strengthned, and how pow'rful you became VVhilst your Designs were in effect the same; To your Alies how helpeful; and to those How terrible, who dar'd to be your Foes; Ev'n when the pow'rfulst of your neighbouring Nations Seem'd so assured of their expectations, That their Sea Forces, in a proud bravado, VVere termed an Invinsible Armado; Till GOD befriending you, did with one puff Bring down their Pride, and blow their Malice off. Power, wealth, and honour, ever since that day He, likewise, heaped on them, many away, VVhilst you continu'd Friends, though you had many Backslidings and defects as gross as any. As to your outward welfare, all things, yet, To prosper, GOD doth graciously permit. Some of you, have by loosing all, got more Then ever they enjoyed heretofore; Some other, though of all; no less bereft Are twice as rich as they, now nothing's left, By having thereby learn'd to prize that most, VVhich being gotten never shall be lost. And, they who this worlds wealth do more desire Have means enough their longings to acquire. The chiefest Forraign Trade to you is given In all the Realmes and Countries under heaven. Your Ships are numberless, your Merchants more And richer, then the Tirians heretofore. Your Ware-houses are stor'd by your Commerce VVith all things precious through the Universe; For which you were envyed by all those VVho either seem'd your Friends or are your Foes. Your Naval Forces if you timely might Perswaded be sincerely to unite, In Righteousness, would ballance all the rest Between the Orient Indies and the West And both the Poles, enabling you to give Those Laws to all men, who by Traffick live, VVhereby, there might, for all, sufficient Trade In safety, and with equity be had; VVithout which, whatsoere you shall obtain VVill prove but an unprofitable gain. And, (which is more considerable, far, Then all your honours, power and riches are) GOD, hath among you, sown the seeds of Grace More plentifully then in any place Below the Sun: his Plants refreshments wanting Though set in blood and Fire, at their transplanting Into your Borders, so well thrived there Ev'n then, that millions from them sprouted are; And, more from them continually shall sprout In spight of those who seek to root them out; Yea, though you by your folly forfeit those Advantages which he on you bestows, For their sakes, whom some of you do revile Oppress, and from their native Lands exile. For, GOD hath made your Countrie, to become The strongest Bulwork in all Christendom, Both against GOG and MAGOG cover'd Foes And such as openly, the Saints oppose; That, saving Truth and sincere innocence Might thereby be preserv'd from violence; Especially, from their hate, who pursue The precious feed of Christ in them and you, By Antichristian wiles, which hatched were In your own wombs, and nursed up now are By seeming Friends, who hide their fallacies VVith gaudy vails, and vain formalities, Untill the souls for which they traps prepare Are hunted unto death, or to their snare. These Ingineers, within your bosomes lie, And, what their chief aims are, no doubt have I. Think on these things, and whether 'tis from me Or from God, that you minded of them be; For, what I had to write when I begun I knew not; nor shall I know when 'tis done, What, by my Prompter, I was mov'd unto Untill I read it over as you do, To see what is of God in ev'ry line As if those writings had been none of mine. When GOD, by despicable means and men, (As he to do is pleased now and then) Speaks to a King or Nation, it doth carry A shew of somewhat extraordinary To be consider'd on with serious heed, And it importeth somewhat to succeed. When waving men train'd up in learned Schools He speaks to them, by those whom they count fools, Makes others (as of old some Prophets were) Actors in things that scandalous appear To most Spectators, yea, ridiculous To sober men (as oft of late with us) Rendring them signs unto their generation Of what's to come; 'tis worth consideration; (Especially when injuries and scorn Are patiently with sober stoutness born, For conscience sake) and all men, truly wise (Although such dispensations fools despise) Are deeply sensible, of what on those The ignorance and hate, of some impose, To whom, it will be manifest ere long, That, they have injur'd those, to their own wrong. If yet you know it not, now be it known That, by the power which is on you bestown To be on all occasions, whilst you have it Employed for his honour who first gave it) You were intrusted, and inabled so As you have been, not your own will to do; Or, that you to exalt your selves above Your Neighbours, GODS donations, might improve Into such an exorbitance of power That, at your pleasure, you might them devour, Oppress your Brethren, and advantage them VVho Adversaries are to you and him: For, they were given to preserve their Peace VVho, under you, in love and righteousness Desire to live; the same Faith have profest, And by Usurping Tyrants are opprest; VVhich Grace if you shall turn into oppression Or wantonness, will hasten your perdition; Make many of your truest Friends grow sad And me, who of your welfare should be glad, Be forc'd my work to close (in imitation Of Jeremiah) with a Lamentation. You will but give your foes just cause to laugh To see you quarrelling for straw and chaff VVilst they get opportunity to burn Those Granards down, whereby the precious corn Might be preserv'd, wherewith your bread of life, May be supply'd, if you desist from strife. VVho can assure you that the provocations Whereby, now very many in both Nations, Exasperated are, will not afford Fit opportunities by your discord Some such contrivances then to project And prosecute, as prudence may suspect? For, though what Faction moves mad men to do VVill ruine them at last, so 'twill you too. VVhat, men who have good consciences will shun VVill by men without consciences be done VVhen God shall let them loose, or call together All sors of sinners to correct each other. 'Tis likewise possible, that many things Pretended causes of your quarrellings If they were well examin'd, would be found Meer scandals raised without real ground, To make misactings on both sides appear (By Aggravations) greater then they were. For, in both Nations, there is such a Rabble (By their ill manners much more despicable Then by their Fortunes) who, for servile ends, In hope of profit, (or to make them friends Of those whom they sought to exasperate) Did some misactings much more aggravate Then there was cause; and so, that which was bad VVas by their falshood, more offensive made: This, hath been kindling 'twixt you many years A smothering Fire, which now to Blaze appears; But hitherto these had not power to blow The flame so high as they have rais'd it now: For, GOD did but permit them for probation And though it was of long continuation, Hath so your wealth increas'd, that as 'twixt Lot And Abraham, it now hath strife begot. GOD, by his grace, direct you to a course, The consequent thereof may not be worse. Your force united hath been heretofore A terrour to the vassals of that Whore VVhich rides the Beast: yea, often such a dread To her, when she at highest bore her head That, she's inrag'd to see you have so long Against her Soceries continu'd strong; Though to supplant you she laid many a Train Which had not then contrived been in vain, Had you been so divided as this day You are, or as perhaps e're long, you may. But Unity did make you so compact A Body, that her wiles could not distract Your prudent Counsels, neither from your course Divert you, by her cunning joyn'd with force: This, by experience found, she doth begin To work upon you by another Gin Which will extend to many, far and near Who deem they thereby unconcerned are: For, they who foolishly, themselves now flatter That they by fishing in your troubled water Shall get Advantages, will be bereaved Of those expectancies, now preconceived: For, that which follows, be it whatsoere Will further GODS designments, but not their; And, though you may by folly, loose your ends She shall not bring to pass, what she intends. If she by this Division, break your power She thinks that she shall easily devour The scatter'd Churches, which in hazard lie Within the limits of her Sov'raignty; Then, those that stronger are (though more remote) Assoon as opportunities are got To practice on them, by the force of Arms Or, by the power of her besotting Charms: And if they take effects, her work is done, Untill GODS Counter-work shall be begun, Who, though mans working with him he expects, Shall no advantage lose by their defects VVho give Advantages unto his Foes By trifling that away which he bestows, To do him service. But, they shall become Partakers with Apostates in their doom. That grand Impostris now resolves to play Divisions, making all those whom she may, Dance to her Fiddle; and to bring about Her purposes, hath very little doubt: For, as a wasted Candle when it sinks Into the greasie socket (and there stinks) Sends greater flashings forth, and blazeth more A little while, then any time before; So, she doth now, with her whole force persue The mischief she hath long design'd for you; And, not much wanting seemeth to compleat That, whereupon her heart hath long been set: For, to that end, were sent forth before hand, Her Emissaries into ev'ry land, With Dispensations (as occasion haps) To make use of all courses, forms, and shapes: And these have into all Societies All Constitutions and Fraternities, (Divine or Civil) all Affairs, Relations, And Interests, what ever, in both Nations, Screw'd, such a party, that, chief sway they carry In things divine, civil, and military; So, that, as once it was prophanely said, Should GOD stand neuter, till her game were plaid, She would prevail against you, at this time, Because, no aid shall be withheld from them Who malice you, nor any furtherance Her power and sinking Throne to readvance Which Antichrists confederates can add, Or, from prophanest persons may be had. Be therefore heedful that by your dissention You make not seizable her ill intention By trusting to the Complements of those Who are her vassals, and your secret foes, And (as you, oft do) speak fair, but to deceive That they without suspicion may contrive Your whole destruction, and recover power To re-enlarge their Babylonian Tower. Which, is this day as truly their design, As those thoughts, whereon, now I think, are mine. Blest let them be who seriously endeavour, To reconcile you; cursed, they who sever Whom GOD hath joyned; For, no outward curse To any can befall, that will be worse Then that which will in likelihood betide To these two Nations if they long divide; But, they who of the breach most guilty are The greatest burthen of that curse shall bear. I am no Person who confederates With home-bred male-contents, or Forraign states Either to get revenge for wrongs received Or that some gain may be thereby derived Unto my self: For, whatsoere it be, That which best pleaseth GOD, best pleaseth me; And having no designments of mine own Can wait with patience till his will be shown. I, being one who having oft fore-seen, And fore-told things that have fulfilled been, Endeav'ring to prevent the prosecutions, Of wicked actions and rash Resolutions, Am by a power which I dare not oppose Once more stir'd up, to preadmonish those (As heretofore) who now seem rushing on In that Career, as other men have done, Which tendeth unto that end which befell To those, who sleighted, what I did fore-tell: And, I to speak again must not forbear; Vouchsafe therefore to me a patient ear, Be wary, that your Avarice and Pride, Prove not to be a motive to divide At this time, though when you divided last Your likely hazards were soon over-past, And plagues remov'd ere any penitence Had testifi'd remorce for your offence, Lest, greater evils follow, and the trouble Removed then, returns upon you double, For, Nations to expose to wars unjust Meerly to satisfie a private Lust, And those inforce the greatest weight to bear, Who no way guilty of transgressing are Of that which in a War ingages them, Is questionless, a sanguinary crime From which, no temporary priviledge Can vindicate, before a Righteous Judge: But, it will bring down Vengeance in due season From him whose Justice cannot be call'd treason Although your High Priests, and some others too, The boldness may assume to term it so. If wrongs be done, let all good means be us'd To judge between th'Accuser and Accus'd E're sentence pass; and do not then prolong Due recompence to them who have had wrong; Lest by delaying what you should restore, Instead of righting him, you wrong him more. Ere battail you begin, let peace be offer'd, Accept a good expedient, when 'tis proffer'd. Remit small faults where you find penitence: Upon the same terms, let the great'st offence Be pardoned also, when the perpetration Of wrong, exceeds all means of expiation; In that, you'l imitate the King of heaven Who often hath such Crimes to you forgiven. Make not the Sword your Umpier, till you see A remedy, no other way can be. Your just Rights to preserve, do what you can, But, fight not to inslave another man; Nor venture your own Countries to inflame That you may get a fruitless aiery fame; Much less to grasp a power, which when acquir'd Will in your hands, be like Granados fir'd; Yet, to avoid the mischief and the Curse Of War, make not a Peace that shall be worse. Nor when you are at rest provoke his wrath Who, quietness to you vouchsafed hath, By cheating them of their just expectations Who truly wish the welfare of both Nations, Adventuring their persons and estates, To save what to your interest relates; And then intrusted you with their defence, Thereby, but as a second consequence. If you would keep Rebellious men in awe, To ev'ry one his birth-right due by Law Preserve impartially; and unto none Deny that which is due to ev'ry one; Lest, whilst abroad ingaged you become In warfare, there may be worse fraies at home: For, that Allegiance which is in all Lands 'Twixt Prince and People, upon two feet stands, So, that if th'one fails in what it should do, In equity, so will the other, too; Men who are much oppressed against reason, Will not much fear to act what you call Treason; And, then, from questioning, on whom there lies The greatest guilt; small profit can arise. Which way soever, therefore, GOD shall daigne To make you Friends, and give you Rest again, With moderation, and with Justice use That Mercy; for if you the same abuse This, without question, will ensue thereon; Both, shall one way or other be undone. The conquer'd shall inslaved be; and they Who conquer, be made slaves another way. Make not your Rest to be a snare or Stale As Fowlers do, to cath Birds there withall. Nor means, your selves with such vast power to arm, As helps not so much, to do good, as harm; For GOD will heed it, and you shall be caught Ev'n in those Traps, which your own hands have wrought, And as old Rome was you shal be at length Orewhelm'd and destroy'd, by your own strength. To mine own Countrymen, I'le write or say Nought at this time, which any justly may Apply to them alone; lest, some once more May terme it scandalous as heretofore, Or call me Libeller, for being bold To tell them Truths (although in season told.) I, Have, so often in particular And so long, time been their Remembrancer With small regard (except from such as do Love simple Truth, and suffer for it too) That, I to them, will nothing mention here, Save that in which, an equal part to bear Both Nations may be said, without my blame; Because, thereby, I somewhat hopeful am To raise thence an expedient to escape The being caught again, in my old Trap. But I'le apart, a word or two express To our Dutch Neighbours in true friendliness. Remember what of old the English Nation Hath been to you; and with how much compassion They, your Protection timely undertook When you extreamly by the Spanish yoke Oppressed lay; and whether the pursuing Of those things which are at this present doing, May not at last reduce you back to that Deplor'd condition, or a worse estate; And bring you once again, inslav'd to lie Beneath such an unbounded Monarchy As you abhor: Your Senators are wise, They in their heads, I know do bear their eyes And, if they be not hoodwinckt, need by none Be minded, what should be consider'd on: Yet, since but men, let them not be offended With what is by a stranger recommended Unto their serious heed, and let my caution Be acceptable unto your whole Nation. Consider, whether all they who pretend Your Country, Cause, and Intr'st to befriend May not more complemental prove then real, When time shall bring their Friendship to a tryal, And be as false to yon, as you have seen Most States and Princes, often to have been Unto each other, though aly'd by blood, By Aides in times of need, Leagues, neighbourhood, And all ingagements whatsoere, which might Devised be, them, firmly to unite. Think, whether such have not a party now Among you, which as things to ripeness grow, Will help improve them, to set up a power Tending to their advantage more then your: Yea, whether, you already may not see That, some to such a purpose, active be, This day among you; and, take timely heed, That, what you would prevent, may not succeed. Ill words corrupt good manners; and I hear That, you no scurrile language do forbear VVhich either heighten may the indignation And fury kindled in our English Nation, Or, make them to be hated of your own; As if you wholly resolute were grown, So to divide both, that by no endeaver, They might be reconcil'd again, for ever. This fault, which to the vulgar I impute VVill questionless produce a poisonous fruit, And, therefore, though I truly may confess My Countrymen have not offended less, In that kind (and may peradventure take Occasion from these Lines, a change to make Within themselves) I, heartily intreat Both you and them, his love to imitate VVhose doctrines we profess, and bridle more Their rude tongues, then they have done heretofore That, from good words, there may at last proceed, True reconcilement both in Word and Deed. Of one thing more, put you in mind I would (VVhich now to your remembrance bring I should) VVere I not hopeful you oft minde it so, As it becomes you, and repent it too, And that, we shall give mutual satisfaction For ev'ry scandal and injurious action, On either charged, for which, to make even 'Tis in our power; the rest must be forgiven. Lord GOD, vouchsafe thy mercy to these Lands And, if with thy good pleasure it now stands, The Plagues for their demerits due, adjourn, That Peace with Grace united may return Before the madness of this Generation Hath frustrated their means of preservation. By Judgments, and by Mercies interwove, By chastisements in anger and in love By threatnings and by gentile invitations, Thou, to reclaim us from prevarications Hast oft assaied; adding unto these Whisperings in secret to our consciences; Spoke to our ears by men, unto our eyes By Apparitions and by Prodigies: Yea, whilst I'm writing this, there doth appear A Blazing Star within our hemisphere, A swell unto our neighbours as to us Made visible: And wherefore Glares it thus With an Aspect so dreadful at this time, But, to point at, and forwarn us and them Of some approrahing mischief, whereof heed Is to be taken by us, with all speed. Lord, let us not, still obstinate remain Rendring (as heretofore) all quite in vain, That's seen, or said, or done, till none for ever By Word, or Deed, our safety shall endeaver. That time is not yet come; I'le spend therefore In hope of good success, a few words more; And, look to be excus'd if I shall thrice, VVrite that, which I have writ already twice; For, neither can hard flints or knotty blocks Be shap'd without reiterated strokes. Why should you quarrel? what are now your wants, But, Grace and Faith to use well what GOD grants? The World is wide enough, the Seas have room Sufficient for your Ships to go and come: Expedients will be found which may procure An honourable peace that will endure VVithout a disadvantage unto either If to make proof thereof you joyn together. Impartial Justice, brotherly compassion Love, meekness, piety, humiliation Faith, prayer, penitence, with such like things Are those, whence wealth, and peace, and honour springs To them, who will perswaded be to do To others, as they would be done unto; As jealous to redress a neighbours wrongs As in that which to their own ease belongs; As forward, an oppressed man to hear As cruel Tyrants to afflict him are; And could forbear intruding on GODS right A setled peace thereby enjoy they might, Without fear; yea, without a just suspicion Of Treasons, Insurrections or Sedition: And, they whom you distrust, will be more true Then they, in whom you trust, shall be to you, If you endeaver to contract a peace And keep it, by unfeigned righteousness: Although such mediums are but scoffed at Or sleighted, by most Ministers of State. But, such a Blessing, never can be got Or kept, by that whereon most Nations dote. The constitution of whose Governments Are made according to such presidents As Jeroboam left, and lost thereby That Kingdom which on his posterity, Should have been fixt, had he not counsel took From flesh and blood, and Gods advice forsook. Not those men, whose Advantages are least, Or most, shall thrive; but, they who use them best; Make GOD alone their Refuge, and contend That cursed strife, in blessed peace may end. 'Tis not your carnal policies, or forces, Your Forts, Ships, Armies, Guards of men &amp; horses; Your fair pretending what was never ment, Your heavy Taxes beyond president, Your flattering Parasites or your Buffoones, Your roaring Hectors, and your Pantaloones, Or Oaths inforced, or great Brags and lies, Nor their complyings whose Hypocrisies Are much depended on, that will effect Those Conquests and those Triumphs they expect Who boast before their Armour is put off, And, at the weapons of the spirit scoff: For, what by vanity may be obtained Shall thereby, be devour'd assoon as gained. You have betwixt you (as imply'd before) Half of all Forraign Tradings, if not more. Your many Manufactures, are become Staple commodities, that bring you home Three times as much in value ev'ry year As those things, which among you growing are Amounted to unwrought; and you are grown As rich in Forraign wares as in your own. The Seas have been your Fish ponds, and afford Enough to make both rich, could you accord And both, alike were frugal. Means of Trade Is in a thousand places to be had, Which to imploy you will sufficient be, When you like Christian Brethren shall agree, Or, but like moral men; nay, if but so As many Infidels, and some Beasts do; And, GOD and Natures Laws, would you direct Aright, if, them, you did not wilfully neglect, Make your own Will a Law, and were inclin'd To that, which hath corrupted all Mankinde Rendring, what for mans real weal was given The greatest outward Plague on this side heaven. So wilfully pursuing your own wayes For your self-ends; that he who doth not praise Your folly, or with silence pass it by, Is thought no Friend, if not an enemy, And, to reprove Vice is become a Crime Judg'd Capital among you at this time. If you consider these things as you ought, (And shall not be displeas'd to hear them brought Thus bluntly to remembrance) I have hope I may still scape the Gollows and the Rope For speaking Truths in season, unto them Who, their well-willers caulesly condemn; And, from their Native Countries, banish those For whose sakes, GOD hath kept them from their foes, Waiting with long-long-sussering, when to him They will return, that, he may turn to them. This you may do; And I have hope of it: For, GOD is resident among you, yet. His Candl stieks are not from you removed; Within your Borders, of his best beloved Are many thousands, for whose sake, he hath Remembred Mercy, in his hottest wrath. Good Laws you have; some, likewise, who profess And practise them, in truth and righteousness Though from your first Loves, you are fallen much And, your defects are at this present, such As in the seven Asian Churches were When first the Mystery was hatching there Which now ore-spreads the world: you have not that Comply'd with, but, the same abominate; And therefore, that you may, return to him GOD hath premonish'd you as he did them, Expecting that you better should improve Then heretofore, his patience and his love, Lest else, you speedily may be bereft As they were, of what, yet appeareth left. A moral Charity retains a place Among you, though grown colder then it was. You have a form of GODliness, whereon If you depended not as you have done, That, which essential is, would more have been Improved, and the power, thereof more seen. Among your many Vices, blended are Some Vertues, which, if you would take more care To cherish, God would such assistance give That they should, for the future, better thrive. Though you have multiply'd prevarications By many carnal, gross abominations, And, are with Jezabel (that Sorceresse) (Who counterfeits herself a Prophetesse) Open Confederates; some of you hate Her Heresies, and their, who imitate The Nicholaitans: God, now therefore Hanges forth to you a Flag of Truce, once more, (Into a Comet form'd) and sets it there Where, it, at one view, may to both appear; That you might speedily and joyntly, do Through Fear, that which Love could not win you to. For, though the Wisards of preceding Ages And, some now deem'd no despicable Sages, Think these prodgious Meteors called Stars Are constituted of such Characters And shapes, as do undoubtingly fore-shew What things particularly will ensuce, (Because such consequents have often been Observed, they are much deceiv'd therein.) There's no such vertue proper to their natures; For, they are only serviceable creatures Employ'd by Providence, to such an end As we by fixed Beacons do intend, When an Invasion's threatned; They declare In general, that foes approaching are; Stir up the Nation to a timely heed But, who their Foes are, what plagues will succeed, How long they will continue; upon whom They first will seize; at what time, they will come; Or such like things by them we cannot know; For, they no more then Beacons can fore-show. So, this late Exhalation doth portend Some Judgment on offenders will descend Ere long, to make them watchful, and prepare To do those duties which expected are; But, in particular presignifies Nor this, nor that; nor any terrifies Who more desires to know, how by GODS grace, To do his will, then what will come to pass. He that is so affected, seldom fears The influence of Comets, or of Stars; Whereas, they who in folly are benighted Oft, with a harmlelss Glow-worm are affrighted. Thus far, my mind I have once more exprest And hopeful am, ere long to be at rest From all my Labours; for, my life, almost, To bring this seasonably forth, it cost. But, some perhaps will now say, what is he That your Remembrancer presumes to be? To those, I make this answer; I am one Who stands instead of such a Block or Stone, As Charity did set up heretofore By high-way sides, and somtime at each door, To save men from the violent approaches Of drunken Horse-men, Waggons, Carts &amp; Coaches, And in that service, often are abused Curst, broken, crackt, hackt, cut, slasht, knockt, and bruised; By those, who stumbling on them, heedless are To what good purpose they were fixed there. And, if this be my Lot, I as I may, Will bear it, as I have done till this day. For, that which follies hath to many seem'd Hath by much wiser men, been well esteem'd: And, I despare not, though confused noises Should at this time drown and confound the voices Of sober men: For, when the raging water Doth loudest roar; winds, make the tacklings clatter, Ruffle the sails, and keep the greatest bustle, The storm is peirced by the Boat-swains whistle; So that all heedful Mariners, thereby Perceive whereto their hands they should apply. So, likewise, though the Rumor of that War Which many hope for, and as many fear, With other such confusions, as our sad Distractions at this present thereto add, Will make these Lines, a while, of small regard With many, and with difficulty heard; They shall, ere long, by some, with good respect Be entertain'd, and have good effect; For, dayes will come wherein, that, shall from them Be eccho'd forth, which all will not contemn; And, from whence, at the last, a Voice will come That shall out-sound the ratling of a Drum; Yet fright no soul but that mans, who depends On carnal weapons, and hath carnal ends.

Some think, I, an Apology may need For daring thus to bid my Friends take heed; And, so perhaps I may; For, not long since, I suffer'd for as blamless an offence; And, heretofore, informed was of ONE, Who said; that to be totally undone Much less displease him would, then if that he Should from undoing, be preserv'd by me; And, shortly after (with no little shame) That, which he might have scapt, upon him came. I hope they wiser are, whom, to take heed I now advise and that they'l better speed. What e're succeds; Praise will to GOD belong, And of the Saints, this shall be then the Song. A Hallelujah, alluding to the 150 Psalm. Come praise the LORD, come praise him Where Saints assembled are, As hee's Almighty praise him His Righteousness declare. In his excellings praise him With Trumpet and with Flute, With Harp and Psaltery praise him, With Viol and with Lute, Let nothing that can praise him Unactive be; or mute. Upon the Timbrel praise him In songs his praise advance; Upon the Organs praise him And praise him in the Dance; On tingling Symbals praise him That, make the loudest noise And let each crature praise him That sense or breath enjoys, Yea, let privations praise him Although they have no voices. FINIS. Sigh for the Pitchers: Breathed out in a Personal Contribution TO THE NATIONAL HUMILIATION the last of May, 1666. In the Cities of London and Westminster, UPON The near approaching Engagement Then expected, Between the English and Dutch Navies. Wherewith are complicated such Musings as were occasioned by a Report of their Actual Engagement; and by observing the Publike Rejoycing whilst this was preparing by the Author GEORGE WITHER. Hold, Hold. If ye knock, ye are broke. Unless God prevent. [My Sighs concern you all, throughout this Nation] To the English Nation, and to every Individual Person within these Brittish Isles, Geo. Wither, wishes that Grace, Peace, and Love in CHRIST JESUS, which by an unfeigned Humiliation, may reconcile us all to GOD; Unite us by an indissolvable Band of Charity, to each other; and in a Christian Amity, withall Nations through the world. My Sighs concern you all, throughout this Nation Who are this day, in true Humiliation To seek the face of GOD; For, we make One Of those two Pitchers whom I do bemone: And, unto whom (then fearing much their breaking, When first I saw War preparations making) I sent a Trumpet, both with an Intent And hope, that which was feared, to prevent; Which, failing my good purpose to produce, I send this now, to mediate a Truce; For, who can tell, but that my words may have Such Issue now, as heretofore GOD gave Unto a private-womans when she spoke For Abel, what effect in season took? So may it prosper as I am sincere In that, Which I have Superscribed here; And, let my Foes on earth, be still as many As there are men, if I wish ill to any; Or, am not pleasd that all should live and die As happy, both in Life and Death as I Who shall not, by a final Wilfulness, Deprive themselves of what they might possess; And slander GOD, as cause Original Of that, which doth amiss to them befal. For, though, not few, my Adversaries be Or such, as, yet, bear no good will to me, I, ev'n for that cause, am in love, their debter; For, him, who loves his Foes, GOD, loves the better: Yea, having partly been, in my distress Relievd by some few, who, do naytheless Seem still my Enemies; it, makes me more, Love GOD, and all Mankinde, then heretofore. A time is come, in which, it is our turn Both altogether, and apart to mourn: Those General Calamities befal Which, for a general Repentance call, And, for particular Humiliation, In order to a publick Reformation, From which, at present, are excepted none; No, not the King, who sitteth on the Throne: For, that which is in Cottages begun Will seize the Pallace, ere the Round is run, If GOD in mercy, answer not our hope, And, to our sins and fears, vouchsafe a Stop. To that end, though this be not what I would Or, should contribute, it is what I could And, may now, be as usefully exprest, As what more artificially is drest: Yea, (though it be, that onely) in effect, Which I have oft preferd without respect, This, seems a very seasonable time, To greet you, with a Reasonable Rime. Accept it therefore, and be not offended With what is conscientiously intended. GOD, who from us doth Trifles oft receive, Requires of none, more then he hath to give: And, if you shall accept what's in my powr He, will of that accept, which is in your; For, all that is contributed, by this, Worth your acceptance, is not mine, but his. Sighs for the Pitchers. Breathd out, in a Personal Contribution to the National Humiliation, formally begun in the Cities of London and Westminster, the last of May, 1666. ‘Such is GODS gratiousness, that, wheresoever ‘He finds a Willingness joynd with endeavour To please or to appease him, though but small, (And in it self worth no respect at all) He doth accept it: But, it is not so With men, what er'e we mean, or say, or do. For, most so pettish are; that ev'n with that Which to their own well-being doth relate, They quarrel; and as much offended are With what, unto their own particular Hath no relation, as to any thing Which may to them a disadvantage bring. Yea, so inclind are, to be discontent With Actions, and with words indifferent, That how to fit all humors no man knows What ere he writes, be it in Verse or Prose. Some, are best pleasd with this, and some with that, With nothing some; or, with we know not what, Except with that, (and in their own mode drest) Whereby their Single Fancies are exprest. If, I may freely, Truth declare in either, To me, it is indifferent in whether: Verse cannot be so justly termd unholy As they, who think so, may be chargd with folly. The Libertie, I therefore, at this time, Resume, to vent my mind in Verse and Rime As heretofore without an affectation Of what, is this day, with most men in fashion; And, what I purpose to contribute now, Shall be such private Sighings as I owe To Publick sorrowings; not such, as may, Without true sense thereof, be puft away. I offer not, now Cures are to be done, That, which will prove no better then Herb-John Or Chipps in broth; nor, when provide I should Apparel to preserve my Friend from cold, Bring them such thin sleight Garments, as are neither Good Silk or Cloth, but Bawbles patcht together, Lace, Points and Ribbands: Nor, to feed them, set A platter full of Sawces without meat, Or, with so little, and so trimd about With Kickshawes, that they cannot pick it out: Nor give the Sick, when they for health endeavor, Such Trash, as may beget a mortal Feaver; Nor Healing Plasters, when I do perceive The Patient rather needs a Corrosive: Nor, is there ought improper to that end, For which, Humiliations we pretend In that, which I in words have added here: Either peruse it therefore, or, give ear. [1.] Before a Storm is actually begun, Or, Symptoms of it, in the Skies appear; Both Birds and Beasts, for shelter fly and run, To scape the Dangers, then approaching near. To what these are by Sense inclind, in season, Men are assisted (for their preservations) By Strong Impulses, both of Grace and Reason, Till they neglect, or sleight those Inclinations. And to the Publick safety, every one Owes what may possibly by him be done: For, there's a Portion due from him that's poor, Though from the Rich, there is expected more. 2. I had some education in the Schools, But my best Teachings, came another way, And, neither to the wisest, or meer Fools, Is that intended which I have to say. My Muse is to a midling-temper fitted, What suits with their capacities to write Who, (not much under or much over witted) More in the Matter, then the Words delight. By that means, when with Trifles I begin, Things useful, are oft, thereby Skrewed in, Which peradventure, had not else been sought, Where, they appeard more likely to be taught: What I but to one end, at first intended, Occasions many Cautions, ere 'tis ended. So, sometimes, twenty businesses are done, By him, who went from home, to do but one. 3. Sometimes too, by what in this mode is hinted, (On sleight occasions in a Vulgar Strain) Such Notions have been in the heart imprinted As were more plausibly exprest in vain: Yea, otherwhile, a few plain words, in season, Experimentally in private spoke, More operate with Sanctified Reason, (And of what they import, more heed is took) Then is (although more gloriously arayd) Of what's but formally, in publick said. Now therefore, I contribute thus, alone, To what was this day, publickly begun. But, stay! what Pannick fear hath seizd this Nation That, they who Triumphd but one day ago, Assume the Postures of Humiliation, And Fast and Pray, at least, pretend thereto? Their Jollitie is at a suddain pause, And to the Temples, they begin to flock; God make th'effect, as real as the cause, That, him with formal showes we do not mock, Lest Plagues increase, and when of what is better, We are in hope, our fears grow dayly greater: For, till our sins are heartily repented, By Fasts and Prayers, Plagues are not prevented. 5. Most, dedicated this moneths first Aurora To their own fleshly Lusts; and spent the day In sacrificing to the Strumpet Flora, Which was by some employd another way, Perhaps though not Prophane, more superstitious Then holy: for, all is not sanctifide That is not vulgarly reputed vitious; Nor all unholy, which will not abide A Sanctuary-Test: But, somwhat hath Doubtless, been acted which provokes Gods wrath Against our Nation, since this Month begun, That brings us on our knees, before 'tis done. 6. Our Safety, Peace and Glory lie at stake; And, we are forced such a Game to play, As makes us tremble, and our hearts to ake Twixt hope and fear of that which follow may: Ev'n they, who lately foolishly did boast, And with proud Vaunts and scorns contemn their Foes, Do find, that Recknings made without their hoast, Arise to more then they did presuppose. Of Foes without them, their regard was small; Of those within them, less, or none at all: But, now, to be assaulted, they begin With outward perils, and with fears within. 7. Beyond reteating we ingaged are With forraign enemies; and not quite free From Factions, threatning an intestine War, If our Presumings unsuccessfull be. As foes do multiply, so, friends grow fewer; And, in those few, there is but little trust: For, none can in another be secure Who, to himself is neither kind nor just. War is begun; the Pestilence doth spread; And, though of Dearth we feel but little dread, They, by whose Labours, plenty was increast, Are by a wasting Poverty opprest. 8. The Rich are discontent, the Poor much grievd: The first have small hope to be better pleasd; The last as little hope to be relievd, And most men are grown stupidly diseasd. Men with Ill tidings in all places meet, Bewailing loss of Goods, or want of Trade: All day they hear complainings in the street; All night, they and their Families are sad. Hereof, they upon others lay the blame Who have been chief deservers of the same: Most, apprehend a general Distress, But, no man knows which way to make it less. 2. They, who should act, or mediate at least, Some course to stop the fury of the Current, Finde, it will most advance their Interest, To be at this time Fishing in the Torrent. They, who have now most cause, least frighted be: Those few alone, who with a filial fear And Christian hope, Gods purposes foresee, Submissive to his Dispensations are: The rest are active still, in their own mode, As if in their own power their safety stood; Or, that it might be wrought, by their own hand, If (as twas once said) GOD would Neuter stand. 16. For our defence, a Naval preparation Is made, as strong, as ever heretofore In any Age, was modeld by this Nation; Yea, stronger much, though not in number more. And, if they who thereof have management, Shall not thereon (as if it could not fail) Or, in themselves, be over-confident, It may against our ablest Foes prevail: But, not unless, we timely lay aside Our malice, our profaness, and our pride, Which by the Lord of hosts, are so abhord, That, they destroy more, then both fire and sword. 11. In mournings, we so little do delight, That, whatsoever sad event befals, Which to humiliation doth invite, It seldom supersedes our Festivals. A Fast therefore, so near a Feast begins, To moderate our Mirth, and make us minde A true and speedy mourning for those sins Whereto we have been, and are still inclinde. A change of Feasts to fastings threatned was, Which is within a little come to pass; And, that, may peradventure be effected Which we most fear, when it is least expected. 12. Hereof the Civil powers having sense, And, fearing what might probably befal, Unless, we strengthned are by Providence Much more, then by their moving wooden-wall; They lately summond us by Proclamations To meet, and on the last of May begin In our head-Cities, such Humiliations As may declare a true Remorse for sin. Early that morning, likewise, lest we might Their summons, either then forget, or slight, GOD, seconded their Act, and from our beds With Peals of Thunders, raisd our drowzie heads. 13. If I was not deceivd, five hours together That Summons lasted, (with few Intervals) Made signal by Rain, Lightning, Stormy weather, And Thunderbolts, which pierced through stone-wals. It brake and melted Bells; consumd a Steeple; Scard Fowls and Beasts, yea, and afraid did make Even them, among those unrelenting People, Who, heed of nought but smart and noise will take; And in security again sleep on Assoon as ere the pain or noise is gone. Alas! what horrours will such men confound, When they shall hear the seventh Trumpet sound? 14. I did obey this Call; and knowing too, That in the common peace, mine doth consist, In meekness, I prepard my heart, to do What might secure the common Interest. The best have failings, and the worst have more; Though therefore they oft erre, who are in powre, With their defects, we must our own deplore: For oftentimes their faults take root from our. King Davids crime sprung from the Peoples sin; For his offence, a Plague on them broke in: Thus, to each other, men of each degree, A mutual cause, of sins and suffrings be. 15. This makes me the more cautious, to take heed Wherein, I personally give offence; And, ere I censure that which others did, Bewail mine own misdeeds with penitence. All of us have offended, (if not more) As much as our forefathers have transgrest: Some, with more Impudence, then heretofore; And, my sins, have the common guilt increast: My self, to humble therefore, I went thither Where good and bad men congregate together; And, where, the worst are, or (before they die) May be, for ought I know, more just then I. 16. He seems to me, unlikely to appease The wrath of GOD, or mortifide to be, Who, offers Prayers like that Pharisees, Who judg'd the Publican less just then he. There is no sign of true Humiliations, But, of a proud self-overweening rather In those, who judge unclean whole Congregations Who with them, serve one Spirit, Son and Father; And (although members of another Colledge) Adore one GOD according to their knowledge. According unto mine, therefore, with them I joynd in Love, and left their doom to him. 17. I dare not such a separation make Twixt persons, things or places, as may bar A freedom in those Duties to partake Which necessary or expedient are. When sins and Plagues grow Epidemical, It such Humiliations then requires, As may in that respect, be general: For, private tears quench not the publike Fires. In all Fraternities and Constitutions, Among men, are both errours and pollutions; Yet safe converse; for pious men hath bin With such, (even then) in all things, but their sin. 18. VVith others, I preferred those petitions VVhich with Christs prayr assentially agree; VVith them, I joyned in all those confessions That seemed proper both to them and me. Their persons I did much commiserate, Who were in hazard by the War now wag'd: With GOD, I meekly did expostulate Concerning that wherein we are engag'd. For others sakes, those fears my fears I made, Whereof, no sense, for self-respects I had; And wished all their hopes might be enjoyd Whereby, their true bliss might not be destroyd. 19. Although particulars inclusive are In Universals; yet, they who neglect Their single Duties, justly loose their share In what the general Devoirs effect. I have contributed my best endeavour, To what I think is publickly intended, And in that duty purpose to persever Which is to my performance recommended. For all things, and all men (so far as they Are objects of our Prayers) I do pray; And, when I doubt, what to insist upon, Conclude my prayer thus: GODS will be done. 20. Their welfare seeking, who would me enslave, The person I distinguish from his Crime; And rather would a wicked people save, Then let the Righteous be destroyd with them. To their proceeds in wickedness, I say GOOD speed to none; and whensoere, therefore I pray against their sins, for them I pray: Yea, when they seem worst, pray for them the more. When LOT was prisner among Sodomites, Against their Foes, to free him, Abram fights. When universal Plagues on us befal, Not knowing good from bad, I pray for all. 21. I have a long time taken so much heed Both of GODS righteous, and our crooked ways, That, whatsoere doth outwardly succeed, I finde just cause to give him hearty praise. So oft, experience I have likewise had, My losses, wants, and those things which I feard, To have been unto me more gainful made, Then such, as more desirable appeard; That, whensoere GOD granteth or denies, My soul is pleasd, and on his love relies. For, when they seemed most severe to be, His Judgements have been Mercies unto me. 22. Such they were, such they are, such will be still, Not unto me, and to some few alone; But, if they be submissive to his will, Such likewise, at all times, to every one: And, though he grants not always that Request, Which is preferred, he doth condescend To what is better; yea, to what may best Conduce to what we chiefly should intend. If, what we pray for, he denies to grant, Humility, or Faith, or Love we want; Or else, there are some other great defects, In those Petitioners, whom GOD rejects. 23. Sins National, so far forth as they were Confest in Publike, I with those confest To whom I joynd; and in particular, If possible, they ought to be exprest. I know we are obliged at this time (Considering why together we did come) To mention such, (or part at least of them) As brought what we would be deliverd from. I hope such were acknowledged by many; But, since I heard it not performd by any, I will enumerate some few of those Provoking sins, from whence most danger flows. For, GOD, at this time over all the Land Hath in displeasure stretched forth his hand; And for our sins, doth strike us, here and there With every Judgement, yea, and every where. 24. We are a Nation to whom God hath given As many priviledges, as bestown On any people that is under Heaven: But, therewithal more proud, then thankful grown. VVe overween, as if we thought none were Our equals; and with so much impudence Our selves before our Neighbours do prefer, That, more Disgrace then Honor springs from thence. Some vaunt as if none ought to be compar'd VVith them, in what is by their valour dar'd; And, some, as if none went, or knew the way VVhereby, men shall ascend to heavn, but they. 25. If what GOD hath conferd, or for us done VVere mentioned, to stir up thankfulness In us; or, to advance his praise alone, Thence would spring many great advantages. But that which most men rather do pursue, Is but before mens eyes a Blinde to raise, And, hide their shameful nakedness from view; Or, blow the Bubbles of an empty praise. And, (as if we were not befoold enough, VVith such ridiculous and frothy stuff) In Ballads, which are for such objects meet, VVe sing out our own shame, in every street. 26. Perhaps in such like things the neighbring Nations Opposing us, as guilty are as we: But, our own sins, in our Humiliations Is that, which to confess, oblig'd we be. Our sins, our sins, are horrid, great and many, Those Plagues too, which they bring on us, are great; VVhereof, there is not so much sense in any, As ought to be, nor such confessions, yet. So loth we are that other men should see (Or, we our selves) in what sad case we be, That, we our scabs and scores had rather hide VVith any Clouts, then let them be espide. 27. So loth we are, in that course to proceed, VVhich GOD and Reason offers to our heed; So apt, to take the clean contrary way; To heed, what every Mountebanck doth say; So ventrous, any hazard to endure, VVhich our enjoyments present may secure; So prone with Bugbears to be frighted from VVhat may secure a happiness to come; And, are so wilful in pursuing things VVhich every day, more mischiefs on us brings, That, very seldom we approve of that VVhich may be for our good, till tis too late. 28. And then, surprised with a sudden dread, To any God, to any Idol run; Move every way, like Dors without a Head; Do every thing save that which should be done: Catch hold on sticks, and reeds, and chips &amp; straws, To save our selves; descend, to fawn on those VVhom we contemn'd; and to support our cause, Against old Friends, confederate with Foes; Yea, with the greatest enemy of Christ; And, rather hazard all our Interest In him, then here to be deprivd of that Which we enjoyed, and have aimed at. 29. VVe are so much inclined to rely Upon the trustless and bewitching Charms Of State-designs and humane policie, On Armies, Fleets, and strength of our own Arms, That we are deafer then th'inchanted Adder, To those who shew to us the way of peace; Good counsel maketh us to be the madder, And, doth but raging violence increase. Yet, they who know they shall not be excusd From doing their endeavour, though abusd, Must speak what on their Consciences doth lie, Whatere thereby befals; and so will I. 30. Such times have been, and such are come agen, Wherein, the Sluggard to the Ant was sent; The Wise instructed were by simple men How to reform their wayes when they miswent. GOD, by them, Kings reprovd, ev'n for their sake Whom they had then inslav'd; and they were heard. Yea, unto Balaam, by his Ass he spake, And, at that present he escapd the Sword: But they who to their words gave no regard, Receivd their obstinacies due Reward. They, who were penitent escapd the blow Which then was threatned; so shall all such now. 31. Ore them a very dreadful Plague impends Whom to the will of men, GOD, doth expose, Though such they be whom they suppose their friends And, have thereof made fair external shows. A greater Plague it is, when known foes are Impowred upon them to exercise All cruelties, and outrages of War Which rage will act, and malice can devise. But, when so terrible a doom as this, And mercie too, much and oft sleighted is, It will be then more horrible then all That can be thought, into Gods hands to fall. 32. Alas! how shall this horrour be prevented, If none in such a time should silence break? VVhen should what is misacted be repented, Unless, to that intent the stones could speak? And, what may they speak likely to prevail Upon a Generation grown so giddy? The Stars to do their duty did not fail; The Elements have often spoke already, And acted in their place, as well as spoken What might our duties, and Gods minde betoken; Yea, so much, and so oft, that what they heard Or saw, few men did credit or regard. 33. Hereby are blessings turnd into a curse; Those hardned, whom it should have softned more; They who were bad before, grow to be worse; Some wicked, who seemd good men, heretofore. Our sins are as immoveable as Rocks; Our Guides and Leaders, either lame or blinde; The Shepherds as great straglers as the Flocks, And both alike, to wickedness inclinde. That, which we thought should make us, doth undo us, All things do seem to cry VVo wo unto us: And, that which should have movd men to repent Doth but their Rage and Blasphemies augment. 34. Most, against those by whom they were offended Are so imbitterd, that although in them They see performances to be commended, Such, naytheless, they totally condemn: Yea, those who have ingenuously confest What seems to be in these worth approbation, They judge to be Time-pleasers, not the best: VVhich is a bar to Reconciliation. Our Proverb bids us give the devil his due; And, they the ways to peace, do not pursue VVho are unwilling, in their Foes, to see Good things, as well as those that evil be. 35. The Knowledge men have gotten hath destroyd That Love, which ought thereby to be increast. The Publick peace, that might have been enjoyd, Is vitiated by Self-interest. The Gospel is abusd, Law made a snare, Or, of Unrighteousness a confirmation: The Consciences of men inslaved are, To nothing left so free as Prophanation. The Rich do quarrel, and the Poor must fight, To serve their Lusts, who do them little right; And they whose Lives to pawn for them are laid, With Deaths or VVounds, or with neglect are paid. 36. Religion is to Policy become A servile Handmaid; and few persons are Conceivd to be so dangerous as some, VVho are in Christian Piety sincere. Now, not to be like others Superstitious, Or to be strict in moral Righteousness, Gives cause of more suspect then to be vitious; Or else, at least, it them ingratiates less. Foundations are so overthrown, that few Are safe in whatsoever they pursue: For, liberty, life, credit, and estate, In hazzard are by all that aim thereat. 37. Pickt Juries, and suborned VVitnesses May, if assisted then with partial Judges, Bring quickly to destruction, whom they pleases; Frustrate all Laws, and all our priviledges: And (what was never heretofore in Reason Thought probable) charge falsly upon some The plotting and pursuing Plots of Treason At open meetings whither all may come. In likelihood, they have nor wit, nor fear, Nor need be feared, who so foolish are: And, I might of my fear be much ashamed If I should fear such Plots, as then were framed. 38. VVho erre in malice, or to get reward, Shall forge an Accusation, though it be Improbable, with favour shall be heard, VVhen none seems guilty of the Plot but he. They, who of all men do least conscience make Of Perjury, at pleasure may destroy An Innocent. They who false Oathes dare take May rob rich men of all they do enjoy. The Lyar is not out of danger ever; But, he that speaks truth boldly, is safe never Until his death, unless by God protected From what may be by wicked men projected. 39. This also, doth increasing Plagues pretoken, (Unless we to repair it speedy are) The Bond of Christian Charity is broken, And brotherly affection lost well-near. Both Persons and Societies seek more Their several new Structures to uphold, Then Disciplines and Doctrines to restore Unto that purity which was of old. From hence doth spring impair of peace and health In minde and body, Church and Commonwealth. For, though few heed it, thence our private Jars At first proceeded, and then, open VVars. 40. All Constitutions both in Church and State Are, for the most part, made but properties To add a grandeur, and repute to that VVhich pride and avarice did first devise. Not those alone, which may essential seem Unto the Civil powre; but also, some Which have among Divine Rites most esteem, Are serviceable to the flesh become. Prophand is every holy Ordinance, Self-profit or self-honour to advance: Yea, ev'n the Lords day and the Sacraments Are made expedients for the same intents. 41. Judgements &amp; Mercies have not in their course Wrought that on us, which they were sent to do: For, what should make us better, makes us worse, And others by our ill examples too. Good counsels timely given we have slighted, Scoft and derided seasnable forewarnings, Neglecting that, whereto we were invited Both by our own and other mens discernings: And, if these failings be not heeded more Now, and in time to come, then heretofore, The Consequents, will not much better be Whether the Dutch are Conquerours, or we. 42. Those Animosities we must repent Which are pretended to be laid aside; Else pride and malice will so much augment Those Practices which more and more divide, That, as the ruine of Jerusalem Had been compleated when the time was come By those three Factions, which then wasted them, Although it had not been destroyd by Rome: So, though we should subdue French, Dutch &amp; Dane, Our own distempers would become our bane; And, that which others are inclind unto, Our follies and our wilfulness will do. 43. The breach of Covenants, of Faith and Oathes We must lament, and from that falshood turn: For, GOD that capital transgression loathes; Oathes, (now, if ever) make the land to mourn. We must confess our sin of bloudshed too, The Blood of Innocents much more bewail, And our oppressing them, then yet we do; Else, of our expectations we shall fail. For, to no more a bare confession tends, Then to increase our guilt, without amends. He that neglects performing what he knows To be his duty, merits nought but blows. 44. We have moreover, failings by omissions Which it concerns us to be humbled for No less then for those actual transgressions Which we are now engaged to abhor: Not one day, no not one year will suffice To recollect them. And yet if we would Our selves but so much humble as it lies In us, GOD, would accept of what we could. Hereof apparent evidences are In Nineveh and Nebuchadnezzar: For, by these Paterns, King and People too Instructed are, what in our case to do. 45. When that King, for his sins had been bereaven Of understanding, and for sevn years space, To live with Beasts, was from his Kingdom driven, And re-inthroned, when unlikely twas; Himself he did abase, Gods powre confess, Acknowledge him, to be in chief ador'd; Declare that powre, extol his righteousness, And that Free grace, by which he was restor'd: Yea, praised him for their deliverance Whom he himself opprest; them did advance Who suffred; and reverst that Law whereby He had compeld them to Idolatry. 46. This signal Patern of Humiliation Was Royal; but, by one both popular And Regal, unto what beseems a Nation In our condition, we directed are. At Nineveh, there was not in a day, Like this, some in the Temples GOD adoring, Some there, inclined more to sleep then pray, Some, in an Alehouse, or a Tavern roaring; Some, who did of their duties Conscience make, Some who perform'd it, but for fashion sake: But I believe, that with more Veneration They testified their Humiliation. 47. Both King and People joyned there as One In penitence, not being less sincere Then formal in pursuing what was done. Strict their commands and executions were. The King, his rich Apparel from him cast (By good Examples, precepts are made strong) He, and his Nobles did proclaim a Fast, VVith all the Rites, that to a Fast belong. The Prophet was believd, in what he said; The Royal Proclamation was obeyd. God, thereto had so gratious a regard That, King and People, thereupon he spard. 48. Alas! how comes it that now Christian men, Are deaf to what GODS Messengers do say? Not so meek-hearted as those Heathens then? More dead in Sins and Trespasses then they. Imperfect was their Penitence, no doubt, Yet God accepted what they did endever, And (though perhaps, their zeal did soon burn out,) He, in vouchsafing mercy did presever. So might it be with us, if we would heed His judgements, and perform what Ethnicks did: For, GOD, upon a Formal penitence, Did with a part of Ahabs doom dispence. 49. But, though we have as much cause to bewail Our sad condition, we have much less fear, And little or no sence of what we ail Until with mischief overwhelmd well-near. Then, likewise, we endeavour all we can To hide what cannot cured be till known, Dissembling grosly, both with GOD and Man, And will not see what's evidently shown. Yea, so presumptuous are, that, now GOD sends His Judgements, and his Arm in wrath extends, VVe labour to obscure it, lest the heeding Of his Proceeds, may hinder our proceeding. 50. And as among the Jews in former ages There were false Prophets and corrupted Priests, VVho prophecid and preachd for Balaams wages, And to promote their carnal Interests, Then Flatterd them into Security: So we have some among us, who as much Do magnifie this Nations Piety As if it never had till now been such. They boast of our prosperities encrease, And promise us both Victories and Peace, As if vain words believd should rather be Then what we feel, as well, as hear and see. 15. Though sensible enough of sin we are not To humble us; or though Plagues yet deferd (How near at hand soever) we much fear not, Nor thereby for this duty are prepard: Methinks the loss of so much blood and Treasure As hath been spent; At home, decay of Trade And Manufactures in so large a measure; Abroad in Colonies, the havock made Should humble us, or that at least, which hath More cause of dread then War, or sudden Death, To wit, a PRESS, whereby some grieved are, More then by all the worst events of War. 2. For, War is pleasing to those Voluntaries, Who, Wealth or Honor, hope thereby to gaine; Through every difficulty them it carries With very little sense of dread or pain. By Suddain Death likewise all Plagues are ended Which Sin, or Folly on our bodies bring; Yea, thereby finished ere apprehended, In which respect, no very dreadful thing. But, to be snatcht at unawares away, From all Relations by a Suddain PRESS, And, from all our Affairs, as at this day, Is more injurious, then words can express. Whole Families, thereby destroyd become; In soul and body, it tormenteth some; And, thereby greater Griefs occasiond are Then do befal, by life or death, in War. 54. I know well that, the Civil powrs intend The prosecution of those Services Which to their Substitutes they recommend, Should be pursu'd without just Grievances: And, to inform us in this very case, (Of taking men to serve them in the Wars) A Law among the Jews establisht was To be our Guide in some particulars: Let it observed be, lest that Oppression Which is occasioned by indiscretion, Those persons to our damage may inrage, Whom we think, for our safety to ingage. 55. With others I did publickly bemone Those things which we ought joyntly to deplore; And, in my Spirit, I lament alone That for mine own Sins, I can sigh no more. I sigh for those two Pitchers, which are knocking Against each other, when they mind not me; Yea, when some are, perhaps, my sighings mocking, Or, not well pleasd with my good meanings be. I sigh to see their Charity decrease Who are pretenders to Religiousness; Not for my self, though I perceive tis grown Less then it was, five shillings in a Crown. 56. I have now, somwhat more then fifty years, Been oft mine own and your Remembrancer; And whilst I live, as oft (as cause appears) Resolved am such Cautions to prefer. For since GOD hath so long preservd me from A total Ruine in such Services, I will continue during life to come Whilst I see need, in services like these, Not doubting but his Mercy shall outlast The Time to come as well as what is past; And, still, as comfortably be enjoyd, Though life in their pursute should be destroyd. 57. This, I have therefore, now contributed In private to what publickly was done, With hopefulness, that when it shall be read It will to good effect be thought upon: For in the common Lot, I shall have part, To whatsoever the success may tend, And dare to arrogate no self-desart, More then they justly may, who most offend. From Publick sins my self I count not free; What is in others bad, is worse in me, Since, he whom GOD so many years hath taught, If bad, is worse then others who are naught. 58. Yet, as there is no Righteousness in me, That, may with safety be confided in; So whatsoere the Common Plagues may be, In me there is no slavish fear of fin: For, in Gods Promise, and his Mediation Who hath Redeemed me, I, so confide, That, I despair not of a Soul-salvation, Whatever to my Body shall betide, And, know, that, whilst to live, more then to die, Shall tend to what GODS name may glorifie, My life shall comfortably be enjoyd When thousands round about me are destroyd; And that all, who are firm in this belief, Shall see a glad end of their present Grief. Lord in that patience keep me alway strong, Which, to the Saints probation doth belong. 50. There was a Promise made long time ago, To some, who then in our condition were, (And, in what they were to believe, and do, As much as they, we now concerned are) To them, it by GODS Prophet was declard That, from their wickedness if they returned, One with a Writers Inkhorn was prepard To set a Mark on all who truely mourned, Assuring all who had his Mark upon them That when the common Judgements seized on them It should not harm them, as to that, at least, In which a real safety, doth consist. 60. That Mark is set on thousands at this day, And many VVriters hither have been sent To shew it, and inform us how we may The Mischiefs threatned, seasonably prevent. Prophets rise early, and do sit up late, To mind us of our duties, yea, there are Some thousands ev'n this day, declaring that Which they are bound to speak, and we to hear. To that end also, GOD, hath now and then, Employed me, and my Despised Pen, As at this time: and, at his feet I lay What I have writ, and what I have to say. I might— But, hark! methinks, some Whisperings I hear, As if both Navies now ingaged were: And, Lo, the suddain Rumour of that Storm Startles my Muse into another form, Before I am aware, and makes me stop, To heed, what it contributes to my hope. Fame speaks it louder, and th'increasing sound On every side, my person doth surround. If what we fear succeeds, let them speed worst At last, who of this War gave just cause first; And, by both Parties, let all be amended Wherein they joyntly, or apart offended. More blood! more fury still! are bruitish passions No whit abated by Humiliations? No marvel then, no good effects yet spring To peace conducting, by my Trumpeting, When I first saw a likelihood of breaking Our Pitchers, by the Preparations making; For, that, wherein divine expedients faile, Humane endeavours little can prevaile. My heart is pinched betwixt hope and fear, By musing upon what I see and hear, With that whereto our Actings may amount When we of all events have had account. Fame tells us, that the English and the Dutch Have fought five days together. This is much, And I think so implacable a Rage, Was rarely paralleld in any Age, If (as it is reported) neither side Gave Quarter, whatsoever did betide. How that with Christian charity may be Consistent, it appeareth not to me; Or, how it quadrats with the tender nature That's proper to a reasonable Creature: Nor do I know infallibly how far It is permissive in an actual War; Nor is it known to any, till he tries The justness of it in extremities. To censure that, I therefore, will forbear Which lies without the compass of my Sphear. King David in some cases, such things did As Natural compassion doth forbid. This I dare say, no man can see that end Whereto, a bruitish fury, will extend, When both provoked, and let loose, to do Whatever it shall then be prone unto. I clearly gather from our contestations, What may be truely judged of both Nations As to their daring, and Couragiousness; Which, I in few words, fully will express, Ev'n thus: (for nothing parallels it fitter) Two English Mastive Dogs never fought better; Nor hath ought oft been acted heretofore, Which evidenced humane courage more, If all be truely said which we have heard This day, of these Antagonists averd: For, though some Cowards upon either side, Were so amazd they knew not what they did, And some (when blinded by the fires and smoke Slaughtred those Friends, whom they for Foes mistook; In that long combate, neither of the two The other, did in any thing outdo. And (which deserveth heed) no wind yet wags That brings us tidings of such Fears, or Brags As usually are published abroad, When Rivals are ingaged in this mode; And, that, to me presageth a success, Which may to both contribute happiness, If meekly, they and we, submit unto What GOD vouchsafeth to permit, or do, Who, did a Mercy unto both begin When he withheld the French from coming in; Which Mercy, though yet hidden, will be seen VVhen time removes that artificial Skreen, VVhich, an abusive Policy invents To interpose twixt actions and intents. Heed, therefore, let both take when this fight ends, How it concerns both, quickly to be Friends; VVhat may be quite lost; what may yet be saved: How both may by their Discord, be inslaved: VVhat great Plagues they now feel; what may betide More grievous, if they further should divide; VVhat great advantages it might bring thither Where, they their Strength &amp; Courage joyn together, Not thereupon as heretofore presuming, Neither that glory to themselves assuming, VVhich appertaineth unto God alone; Nor vaunting of what their own hands have done; Nor la'bring, Breaches to repair with Lies, Nor putting upon Truths a false disguise, (A fault now so habitual become That, tis not easily refrained from) Nor sacrificing what GOD doth abhor, Or that, which at the best, he cares not for; But, giving what he still takes in good part, (Though meritless) an Humble contrite heart. Then, that the Mercies daignd may be prolongd, Let not his Saints in any wise be wrong'd; (Among whom many will be found at last, On whom the world reproachful terms hath cast) For, when, or wheresoever, Peace he makes, It is at their Requests, and for their Sakes; Whereas, no Peace is true, or long possest, Where Innocents are causlesly opprest; Especially, where they oppressed are Who serve GOD, with a conscientious fear According to their knowledge: of this Crime, Neither the Dutch, nor they who now with them Associate, so guilty are as we Do at this present day appear to be. And, I believe 'twas therefore that GODS hand Enabled them our Forces to withstand; And still preserves both, that both might more heed, What they have done, and how they should proceed. Among those things by them and us misdone Provoking GODS displeasure, this alone Next mentiond, is enough without one moe, Us, in all our Plantations to undo: For, to advance our carnal Interest We parallel the Practice of the BEAST In merchandizing Souls; Yea, more then so, Have set to sale, both Souls and Bodies too, In many Colonies: our Avarice (Which is one root of evry other Vice) Gave partly an occasion of that Jar, From whence first sprung, this present bloody War, And, which at last, will totally destroy, Both that which we in Forraign Lands enjoy And here at Home, unless we shall with speed, Repent that course wherein we do proceed. We do not only there, both sell and wast Mens Bodies whilst their lives and strength do last, (In bondage and in labour like a Beast, From which they have no hope to be releast,) But, miserably, keep them, too, inslavd Without the means, whereby the Soul is savd: Whereas, a blessing both to them and us Might be procured, by endeav'ring, thus: Ev'n by providing Conscientious Preachers, To be one day in every week their Teachers. This would in part at least, excuse the Crime, Whereby Guilt lies on many at this time. I, seriously have heeded with compassion What them concerns, who have to God relation, And, in particular, what I beheld Or, heard concerning those of late Exild For Conscience sake. How much ado there was; How much time spent, to send them to the place Of their Confinement; what, within short time, Befel thereby to others; what to them Worth observation; and how they were cast Into the powre of our Dutch Foes at last, To whom their Ship and Goods are made a prey, Who undertook to carry them away. Whence I collect, that, we shall nothing win, Whilst we are guilty of so great a Sin; And, that by long continuance in this guilt, Much blood that might be saved will be spilt. Of this sin, therefore let an Expiation Be constantly endeavourd through the Nation, And henceforth, twixt the English and the Dutch, Let nothing be contended for so much As, whether shall the other most excel In Love, in Piety, and doing well. Let both petition for, Grace, Truth and Peace, And, for their mutual Amities increase, Let them not Fast to be protected in Their quarrellings, but, fast from Strife and sin, And when Humiliations they pretend Begin them with beginning to amend; Withhold their hands from Lawless Violences, Not cloke Hypocrisie with fair pretences, Nor think, when God vouchsafes Deliverance, It is, their Pride and Selfness to advance, Or, that, when they a Victory have won, Twas got, that they might do as they have done. This, (though Humiliation, we pretend) I fear, by very many is designd. For, Providence hath brought me to behold What I should not have credited if told. The dreadful hazzards which we now are in, So little moves to penitence for Sin, That I have heard of one this day, who from The last Ingagement came sore wounded home Who, ere those wounds were cur'd, did by another Endeavour, how he might corrupt the Mother To be her daughters Baud, and to contrive The means, how they might in uncleanness live. This I have heard, and (whether yea or no) See probability it may be so. Alas! what will insue thereon in fine If this should be the general designe? Oh! let each individual Soul beware Of such presumptions, lest they spread so far That, GOD, in his provoked indignation, Wholly destroy this wicked Generation. In chief, let those Grand Parties whose escapes Yet, give them time, beware of a Relapse And hear him; For, assured then I am, That, he, (according to the Chronogram Upon my Title-page,) us will so hear, That, this will prove to be a happy year. Let us forbear to vaunt, as we have done, Of Conquests, whilst our Arms are putting on: For, an example of that folly have I In their invincible (so called) Navie Which was in Eighty eight, upon our Coasts Destroyed after many shameless Boasts. God grant that Sixty six, be not to us For such like Vauntings as unprosperous. I hope the best, and I as much do fear The worst, according as our Actings are. If possible it be, let an Accord Be made by Christian Prudence, not the Sword. For that Cure, usually doth leave a Skar From whence at last, breaks forth another War. If to no end, our Quarrels can be brought Till we have to the utmost fought it out; Let them, whom GOD shall pleased be to crown With Signal Victory, themselves bow down, In true Humility, as low as they Who, then, have lost the glory of the day; Such Mercy showing, as they would have shown Unto themselves, if that case were their own; And, mind what Plagues, GOD threatens to inflict On them, who add grief, where he doth correct: Else to avenge their Cruelty and Pride, A greater Foe, shall rise up in his stead Who was destroyed, and they shall then have That Measure to them given, which they gave. When all this, and much more then this is done, We may, as far be, as when we begun From being truly humbled. For, with leaving Gross sins, there enters often a deceiving Whereby, the Soul may be polluted more And, in more danger then it was before; Unless we shall together with a loathing Of all sins, Value our ownselves at nothing. For, we have nought good, but by imputation, Which to confess, is true Humiliation If done sincerely. It will then abide The Test, when thus it shall be qualifide; And, we soon after, shall behold, or hear What will compleat our Hope and banish Fear, For, GOD in Mercy always doth return To all, who for offending him, so mourn. Whilst this was writing, Tidings we receivd (Which very willingly we then believd) That we were Victors. God vouchsafe thereto A blessed Consequence, if it prove so: Make us, whatever otherwise befel, Sincerely thankful that we speed so well, Still mindful of the hazzards we were in, Before that Doubtful Trial did begin; And be henceforth, obedient to his calls Lest else a worse thing suddainly befals: For, most to fear him, we have then most cause When an impending Judgement he withdraws, Since, in our Duties, if we then grow slack; Vengeance, with double Rigour it brings back; But, much more, when instead of Penitence Those Faults renewd are, which first gave offence. That News came whilst the People were in prayr, Some, hopeful, some afraid, some in despair, Such Medlies making of Words, Thoughts and Passions As oft befal in suddain Alterations; And peradventure, causd some to forget To what end, they that day together met: For, many had expressed signs of Gladness Before, they gave one sign of Sobersadness, Days of Thanksgiving and Humiliation Being by them, observd still in one fashion; And, by their various Postures, those Digressions Occasiond were, which vary my Expressions. We were not like Jews harps on Willows hung, But, like those, which are always tun'd and strung For Jiggs; and we, a Triumph-song begun Before our Lamentation-song was done. From laying, by, our vain Desires and Boasts, From Sanctifying of the Lord of Hosts With filial awe! and Praise to him returning (For joyful Tidings on our Day of mourning) We were so far, that, evn before we knew, Or could hear certainly, the News was true, We skipt abruptly, from Humiliation Into our Antick mode of Exultation, Joyning our selves to throngs of Fools and Boys, In Triumphs, which consist of Squibs and Noise, Of Healths, and Bells, and Fires, and Tunes, and Smoak (Thanksgiving Tools, in which delight we took) Objects of Scorn, to wisemen rendring us; To grave Spectators, more ridiculous Then pleasing: And, instead of some Relief To sufferers, an increasing of their Grief, Chiefly to those poor Orphans and sad Wives, Whose Husbands, and whose Fathers limbs and lives Were lost in that Ingagement, whereof they Had little Sense, or drank the same away, (Whilst they who hardly scaping it, lay grieving, Their safety, rather doubting then believing) And, these too, when grown sober, found they had Not so much cause of Mirth, as to be sad. An outward Joy, exprest with moderation, And Triumphs, are not without Approbation, When they shall be exhibited in season, And for ends justified by sound Reason; Yet, for all Victories, they are not so; Nor the same things, fit at all times to do. King David knew it did not him become To triumph when he conquerd Absolom, And I have seen, for Victories, of late, (Much less to be rejoyced in than that) Great Joy exprest: yea, for a Conquest won (Thanksgivings also rendred) where was none. At all times, by all men, are Praises due, And thanks to God, for all things that ensue On our Endeavours: for, in all he doth Inclusively, are comprehended both Justice, and Mercy: yet, our thanks to GOD Is not on all occasions, in one mode To be exprest; nor ought we to pretend His Glory, when tis for another end; Lest, he in our Destruction or our shame, Provoked be to glorifie his Name. In both our late Ingagements GOD hath done That, which both Nations ought to think upon With much more heed, and much more thankfulness, Then either we or they do yet express. This month last year when we did glorifie Our selves, for a supposed Victory, I did contribute then, as I do now My single Mite, (as well as I knew how) To praise GOD for his Mercy, making none With him, a sharer in what he had done; Then offring also to consideration Such things as tended to Humiliation, Much to the same effect, with that which here, I tender in another mode this year. But, GOD who times, and Orders all we do, My purpose knowing, put a Stop thereto; Perhaps lest if it had been publishd then, It had exasperated more, some men, Both to their own, and to my detriment, Then was consistent with my good intent. For, (by my Printers death) what, I then did In some unknown hand, till this day lies hid; And possibly may come again to light, By that time, this is brought to open sight. Meanwhile, I will proceed, with what, this day A New Occasion prompteth me to say. The said Ingagements, now already past (Which if GOD please, I wish might be the last) By Providential means, have made their swords Speak more, then else with so much power in words, Could have been spoken, to perswade us to What, it, will most concern us both, to do. For, whatsoever, Policy and Pride Have published abroad on either side, Tis evident; (or, may be so to either) Our Earthen Pitchers, are so knockt together That one or two more such like knocks will break them So small, that useless Potsherds it will make them; Except to patch up the Designs of those Who seem their Friends, to whom they will be Foes. This would be better heeded, if it were Propounded by a Private Counseller, A Bishop or a Judge: Thus I suppose, Till I remember, that the best of those Have writ, and spoke in vain: yet, then, were they Obligd to speak their conscience, so am I. But, many, who to be my Friends would seem, (And, not me, or my words to disesteem) Perswade me, in these matters to be mute: Tell me, that my Attempts produce no fruit Save mischiefs to my self: and, other some Affirm this Medling doth not me become. I thank their wisdoms; but, am not so wise As to believe they prudently advise. A Fool may to good purpose speak somtimes, And, they have found sound Reason in my Rimes, Who were not so adverse to words in season, That, they lovd neither Truth, nor Rime, nor Reason. Th'effects to other men will be the same, Whether, to them I speak, or silent am; Yet, since with profit, I have heretofore Spoke somwhat, I will speak a little more, Because, I know the damage will not be So great, then, in relation unto me, As unto those men, who shall be offended With what is conscientiously intended. Successes, good and bad, are shard so even Between them (by his Justice, who from heav'n Beholds both what they did in every place With whatsoere by them intended was) That, if on both sides, Truth might be exprest It would by them and others, be confest, The Sword hath spoke aloud, and plainly too, That, which both Nations speedily should do: That, it speaks also, what they do intend On whose Assistances they much depend: And hints, that both, in their proceeds, (at length) May be devourd by their own Wealth and Strength, For, whereunto amounts all we have heard Three days together, to and fro, averd, But certainty of Ruine, on both sides, To which soever best success betides? What have we heard, by that which pro and con Hath been reported of what's lost and won, But contradictions, intermixt with sounds Of Lamentations, Losses, Deaths and Wounds, And with relation of a Victory, Which with infeebled and lame wings doth fly: None certainly informed of what's done, Or of that which may follow thereupon. We hear sad News one day, as bad next morrow, Or worse perhaps: and shall have dayly sorrow, Till of their sorrows, we more sense have got, Whose Suffrings, we do know and pitty not: And till our Nation shall discharge that better, Wherein to GOD and Man it is a Debter. I have with heedfulness, perused that, Sea-Gibbrish, which is publishd to relate What passed in the Naval fight between Both Fleets; with what, to some a ground hath been To think, the Victory is on our side And, that we still victorious do abide. If so it were (because, it might prevent The Foes proud brags, our Friends discouragement; Or, supersede their Fears) I should be glad, And thankful, for the good success we had: But, nothing therein mention'd found I out, Whence, I could pick forth, what to find, I sought. All I could thence collect, was but thus much, That, We were beaten, and did beat the Dutch, Till they were glad, at last, to sail away, And, we as glad, they did no longer stay. He, that was otherwise informd thereby Doth understand much more, or less, then I; And, for our selves, I know no reason why We should, if, we for GOD, ought not to Lie; For, though it is imprudence to reveal All Truths at all times (and not to conceal, What may occasion mischiefs) never should The Truth be falsesaid, or Untruths be told: And, more advantage would to us, ensue If our Intelligence were always true. Indeed, I found, in that Express, much wit In such terms, as that Subject, did befit; As also, very much, related there To magnifie those who then active were For our defence. And, I well pleased am With what may add to their deserved Fame. To them I grudge no meed, or honour due, Who prudently, and valiantly pursue Their undertakings: But, Gods praise alone, Is my chief Aim. To praise what men have done, Is, to my proper work impertinent, And, also, at this time, to my intent. If, by omitting that, I shall offend In prosecutions to a better end; Or, if that any shall maligne me more, For this, who did not love me heretofore, I shall not think it strange: For, I of late Meerly, for Speaking, and for Writing that, Which both to Gods praise, and Mans welfare tends, Loose daily, very many seeming Friends; Whereby, if they no whit indamagd are, I shall not, for what haps to me, much care; Especially, whilst that, which I designe Tends to Gods praise (without selfends of mine.) To which intention, that which now is read (In these few pages,) is contributed. And though, like Jeremiahs Lamentation, Or Davids humblings, this Humiliation Is not besprinkled with corporeal tears, Or, worded with Hyberbolies like theirs; Nor strowd with Ashes, nor in Haircloth drest; Or, with such formal complements exprest, (As may be, and ofttimes assumed are As well by Hypocrites, as Men sincere) Or, though it may want what affects the Sense, I hope, that, which affects th'Intelligence It shall not want, nor ought, which to that end Is needfull, whereto, I, the same intend: And, tis exhibited in such a mode, I hope too, as will pleasing be to GOD. What, he hath done, at this time, seems to me Not so much heeded as it ought to be, To make us thankful; nor do we express What we pretend, in way of thankfulness As it becomes us; neither do we show it As doth beseem him, unto whom we ow it: But, act it with such vain appurtenances (And break out into such Extravagances) As, to our Sins, are rather an addition Then signes of Thankfulness, or true Contrition. For, though, at full, informd I have not bin What streights, and what great hazzards they were in; Or, of what might have hapned, unless then Assisted more by Providence, then Men; Thus much is likely, we were so intrapt, That, by our own powre, we had not escapt A total Rout, if Providentially There came not in, a seas'nable supply. For, had not GOD, sent Rupert timely back, The Fleet with Albemarl, had gone to wrack; Or, both perhaps, then, been destroyd together, Had not GOD sent the French, we know not whither: Yea, somewhat, in that Providence I see, Which our Foes ought to heed, as much as We. GOD, grace vouchsafe both unto us, and them, To heed, whereto it tends, whilst there is time; And, unto me, and every person living, Timely Repentance, and sincere Thanksgiving. Ere these few Cautionary exhortations, (Which I think proper to Humiliations) I do conclude; Ile add this Corollary In hope, that some, the same in mind will carry. Though very great our Streights and Hazzards are, (And, those may be much greater which we fear) Seek Remedies, by no dishonest course; Lest, thereby, we still make the mischief worse. That, were to do like them, who, when an Evil Befals, run to a Witch, or to the Devil, Who, such Cures, onely, for his Patients hath As their, who kill themselves, through fear of Death. It hath been thought, yea, I have oft been told, That, I, in my Attempts, have been too bold; Yet I think no man standeth in more dread Of doing ought which is not warranted By common Justice; For, I dare not act To save my life, in any such like fact. Nor would my Conscience let me sleep in peace Should I but wink at an Unrighteousness, Which might by me be hindred, (though to gain That, which I do most covet to obtain) Till I repented it: nay, I should dread A Vengeance were impending ore my head, If I in secret, wishd advance unto My hopes, by what another might misdo Without my knowledge; or, by ought not right Both in GODS eye, and evry good mans sight. Which, I profess, that others might beware Of such Ill consequents, as I now fear. If we believe there is a GOD, that heeds The Patience of the Saints, and our Proceeds, Let us not still persist, as we have done, Within mans conscience, to usurp GODS Throne As many do, in most presumptuous wise, Ev'n whilst his heavy hand upon us lies: For, he will shortly make it to appear, None ought, but he, to sit in Judgment there; As also, what they merit, who offend So highly, when an humbling they pretend. At Home, from persecuting of them cease Who do not interrupt the civil peace; Let us forbear in an inhumane mode, More to divide us, and our Foes abrode; Let us leave off, those Railings at each other, VVhich hinder the uniting us together. Till GOD shall judge the cause that is depending Between the Nations which are now contending, Let none of us who in our private Stations, Are called to sincere Humiliations, Presume to judge them further then he knows Their Actings, and what Judgements GOD allows In doubtful Trials; but with Humbleness, Attend on his dispose of the success; Contributing, aswel as tears and prayers, VVhat else, th'Immergencies of our Affairs May reasonably require; lest, we betray Both our own selves, and them we should obey. For, each mans private share, is part of that VVhich is the Joint Stock of the Publick State, And, ought proportionably to be shard, As need shall be, to make a Publick Gard. VVhat, others, are thereby invited to Is that, which conscientiously I do: For, to this end, (though I am so bereft Of all I had, that, nothing now is left But Almes to live on) I, have ever since Paid Taxes, out of that Benevolence; And, will not grudge to do it, whilst GOD shall That way, or any way, give wherewithal: Yea, that the Publick strength, may not decline VVill take heed that it be no Fault of mine, By not contributing, what I think may Be thereto needful, in an evil day If well it be employed, GOD, will bless Their prudent Management, and Faithfulness, VVho therewith are intrusted: If, unjust Therein they prove, and shall deceive our trust, Twill be destructive onely to th'Abusers, And, faithful men, will be at last no Loosers: For, when the Kingdome which we look for, comes, All men, shall have their just deserved Dooms. Hereof, to me, GOD hath oft Earnest given By aids vouchsafed, as it were, from Heav'n, At every need. By him, I have been fed VVith Manna, Quaîles,, and with my dayly bread, (I know not else, either by whom or how) For some years lately past; and so am now, VVithout suspect, of ought which may befal VVhether, my gathering shall be much or small. Yea, now, while I behold despairing fear In most mens faces, almost evry where; Although the day, now very gloomy be; Though falling off, our Chariot-wheels I see; Their Drivers, with much difficulty driving; Against Waves, Rocks and Sands, our Leaders striving, And, GOD, in this day of our great distress, Within a Black Cloud, hiding yet his Face; A Glimmering, I naytheless perceive Of Mercy, shining on all who believe; With Symptoms, of the like aspect to them Who, yet believe not, if they turn to him. Turn therefore, oh return unto him, now; Hear him, and he will give an ear to you. But I fear most men so corrupt are grown, That, my words, are on them in vain bestown: Lest, therefore what I write, they heed the less, I, at this present, will no more express; And, since, in our case, there's no help in Man, His aid, I will implore, who help us can. Let GOD arise! Arise LORD, I implore thee; And, let all those who hate thee, fly before thee; Rebuke them who thy Adversaries are, The Bulls and Calves who take delight in War; Aswel the Common People, as their Kings, Till all the world, to thee, due tribute brings. Let those destroying Angels, which are sent To chastise us, make a distinguishment Between them, who through Humane frailty sin, Without persisting wilfully therein, And, such, as have been unto thee and Thine, Malitious Foes, a long time, by Designe; Or, who, not onely, against us, now be Confederates, but likewise against Thee. In Mercy, look again, on us, and those, Who are, at this day, our professed Foes; Lest, the pursuit of what is yet intended Consumes both Nations, ere the War be ended. Now, so unclose the Eyes of evry Nation, Which hath pretended to a Reformation, That, they may see how much, they have been blinded; How they depraved are, and how self-minded: So prudent make all Governours and Kings, So qualify the Peoples murmurings; So, let thy holy Spirit sanctifie Each Congregational Societie; So shew, to evry Individual one, What ought to be believ'd, and to be done Together and Apart, which may improve That, Principle of Universal Love, In which, the Being of the world begun; Whereby, preserved while Time wheeleth on, And, by which, that perfection shall be gaind Which was by thy Eternal Love ordaind; That we regenerated may become, And not continue, till the day of Doome, So stupified in our sins, as they Who were, at last, with Water, washd away; Or, Sodom-like, in sinning persevere Until with Fire consumed as they were: But, let what thou hast done, sufficient be To turn thee unto us, and us to Thee. I do confess, shouldst thou be so severe, As, but to heed how bad, the best men are; Among us all, there could be found out none Who might be called Righteous; no, not one Of whatsoever Calling, or Degree, Whether, Priest, Prophet, or a King it be, Or of the common Rank; Lord, naytheless In Mercy, and in thy Sons Righteousness Vouchsafe to look upon us; and, to cure Our single, and our joynt distemp'rature. At this time, to those Lustings put an end, Which makes us more then brutishly contend For trifles; and to brawl, curse, lye and swear; Like Dogs, for bones, to scramble, scratch and tear; Fight, wound and kill each other, without heed Of what we do, or of what may succeed. Yea, so inhumanely, as if, now, here The Devils, clothd with Humane bodies were; Hell, as it were, broke loose, and, they come hither With purpose, to bring Hell and Earth together. That, which this may portend, secure us from: Hallow thy Name, and let thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth, as tis in Heaven: Give us the bread of Life; and, that forgiven Our sins may be, let us forgive each other; And, henceforth, live in Amity together, On us, let not temptations, then prevail, When thou permittest any to assail Our persons; that, we may in our Probations Be constant, and enjoy our expectations. Let neither present, past, or future evil, (The temptings of the World, the Flesh or Devil) Have powre to harm, or fright us any more, With Plagues and Wars, as now, and heretofore; Especially, let them not us insnare With those sins, whereof these the wages are. Wholly, to thee, our selves let us resigne; Confess the Kingdom, Powre and Glory thine Without a partner; and henceforth, forbear To seek our Kingdom, Powre and Glory here. Whilst that time lasts, wherein things yet remain Undone, which to thy Glory appertain, And, wherein we must further be imployd, Before the Man of Sin shall be destroyd, (Who very oft, usurps a lodging, where Thy Kingdom is, although he Reigns not there) Him to resist, vouchsafe Assisting Grace To every one of us, in his own place: Preserve us blameless, in that Dispensation Whereto, a Conscentious inclination (Without self-ends) hath joynd us; so to use Our Liberty, that, we do not abuse The Christian Freedom, by intruding on Thy Right; or, by imposing that upon Anothers conscience, by usurped powr, Which, we would not should be imposd on our. And, so incline those also, to do thus To whom thou givest power over us, That none, may to obey them forced be, By being disobedient unto thee; But, let our Duties be performd in Peace To thee, and, to all men, in Righteousness. And, that both We, and our Superiours too, May be the more kept heedful what to do; Make them to know, that, if in what relates To Thee, the humane Laws, or Magistrates Must be obeyd in all they shall command, However they, or we shall understand Thy Word reveald; then, if the Kingdom be The Turks or Popes, we must believe, as he; And, thy Will and thy Deity, thenceforth, Stand for a Cypher, or, for what's less worth: For that, will be the consequence thereof, Though Polititians, at this Truth will skoff: Me therefore, unto what thou callst me to, Keep firm, in spight of all the world shall do. The single, and the joynt Humiliation Of King and People, bless with acceptation, Although, what hath been done, prayd, or confest, Will not abide thy Sanctuary Test; For, hope of an acceptance, none there is, If thou shouldst mark all things that are amiss: And, sav'd from what's deserved, here, would neither Be Good or Bad men, but, sink altogether. Let, in one Duty, none be so employd, That, all the rest be sleighted, or made void. So let us Hear, that, we aswel may Do As Hearken, what thy word perswades unto. So let us strive to Do, that having done The best wee can, wee trust not thereupon; And, so Believe too, that wee may improve Our Faith still more, both by Good works and Love; Remembring, it is Love, that doth fulfil The Law, the Gospel, and thy total will. Let thine own Spirit help us so to pray, That, wee may minde Thee, more then what we say. Since to Speak words, less needful is to thee, Then telling our own hearts, what our thoughts be; And, chiefly used, that we might discern Or, heed the better those things which concern Our selves, and Brethren; because, none can show That unto thee, which thou didst not foreknow. Words, oft are spoke to others, with intent To counterfeit that which was never ment. To such ends, as we ought to make Addressings To thee, are all my Prayers and Confessings; To such ends, I now offer here in words, Those Musings, which my narrow heart affords; And, which drawn, and prest out of it, have been By those great streights, we still continue in. To such ends, I implore thee in this mode; Accept of this Oblation, my dear GOD: Give us his Righteousness, who took our Guilt; Love us, and then, do with us, what thou wilt. These Musings, mee, did waking keep When other men were fast asleep: And, may, when I a nap am taking, Keep others, peradventure, waking. GOD, grant we may so help each other To watch, by turns, or, altogether, That, when the Bridegroom, doth appear (Although at midnight) we may hear, And, keep our Lamps, in such a Trim That, we may entrance have within.

      <field name="fulltext">FOURTH COLLECTION Prosopopæia Britannica: Britans Genius, OR, Good-Angel, personated; Reasoning and advising, touching the Games now playing, and the Adventures now at Hazard in these Islands; and presaging, also, some future things, not unlikely to come to passe. Discovered by TERRÆ-FILIUS (a well-knowne Lover of the Publike-Peace) when the begetting of a Nationall-Quarrell was first feared. Expressed in two Lections, or Readings. [For ev'ry thing, which is below the Sun] For ev'ry thing, which is below the Sun, There is a Time; For some things, more then One: And, if this be well tim'd, the Game is done. To all men, GOD, in Mercy, Once doth come: Calls twice, or thrice; yea, many times, on some: And they who sleight his Grace, must feel his doome. Since, then, for once abusing Love, some fall; Let it be, seriously, well-weigh'd, of all, What may betide those, who, still, sleight it shall. To the meeke ingenuous Reader. Though much contempt is cast on Poesie, The Meek, and men of Ingenuity, Sill, entertaine her with respective eares, When, on her proper Errand shee appeares. For, Sacred-things, and Things most pertinent To Mans well being, by that Instrument, Have been conveyed, ev'n in ev'ry Nation, (Yea, and almost, in ev'ry Generation) Some Poets have prov'd Prophets, to foretell, Things Future, many years ere they befell. And sure, the Latines, to imply the same, To Poets, and to Prophets gave one Name. To You, therefore, this Poem will not seem Unusefull, or unworthy of esteem; Nor shall, to you, the matter be in vaine, Nor want that End, whereto it may pertaine; But, stir up those Affections, and that Care Which may awake you, timely, to prepare Against the sad, and Evill day, wherein The Scorners must have payment for their sin. For, This, will passe by Them, as doth a Blast, Whereof, but few take heed, till it be past, And, leaves Effects behind it which may show What Blast it was, and whence that wind did blow. To you, therefore, the Author recommends These musings, as to them, among his Friends, Who, shall possesse the Earth, when those who flout At wholesome Counsell, shall be rooted out. He to your Doome appeales: And if but Three, Who, zealous of the Publike safety be; Or, but two wisemen; Or, but One, who loves The Peace of GOD, these Raptures well approves; He shall be honour'd, by such Approbations, More, then by all the Fooles of these three Nations. To the scornfully Censorious. What have we here? saies pride-puft-ignorance, More Poetry? yes foole; more, too, perchance, Then thou wilt like; and, more, for thee to jeere, Till foaming at thy mouth, thy Braines appeare Through witlesse Choler, when thy soule shall dread, What, thou with scornfull disrespect, hast read. But (saies a second) this, eight months agoe, Appear'd in Manuscript: well, grant it so; What is infer'd? the Author, doe not blame, That, untill now, you have not seen the same; For, Truth gets License hardly; and, the Presse Was, then, at your disposure, not at his. Who (saies a third) is he, that, in this wise, Our Genius personates? A fourth, replies, The matter, and the Phrase, their Author shew: SIRS, if ye guesse right, much good doe it you. If you, be therewith pleased, so, is he; If not, he, therewith troubled will not be: For, he regards not, so much, how to please, As, how to cure the generall disease. That, is his chiefest aime: to that intent, Himselfe, and fortunes, he hath freely spent, As well as time and words; which, when he dies, Will gaine him, what your malice yet denies. If, you, hereby, will reap no benefit, The maine obstruction, will be want of wit; Or, in the wanting, rather, of his grace; Whose love, ye sleighted, when it offer'd was. Read, if ye list; But, who compos'd the same, Inquire not: for, (although to shew his Name He never was afraid) it sutes not now, With his designe, that he should tell it you; Nor, can it be materiall, so you heed, And prudently consider what ye read: For, whom, or whosoere, he may appeare, That, will be true, which he expresseth here. PROSOPOPOEIA BRITANNICA. The Contents of the first Lection. The POET poetizeth, here, Great Britans GENIUS to appeare; Expostulating (first of all) Some Slips, and Faults in generall. And, tells what of that GAME, he spake, In which, the publike, lies at State. Next, shewes, how He doth move the King, Himselfe into his Orbe to bring; What, will, assuredly, succeed, Unlesse, he shall returne with speed; How, and by whom, and likewise, why He hath been hindred to comply; And, that, the Men, and Hopes, which he Depends on, will his ruine be. Then, are declared, some debates Of Prelates temporall estates; What ought to be believ'd, by Him, As touching their old Claimes, and Them; How much, a Prince obliged stands, To keepe up, such like Deodands; Pleads in what case, a State, or King, May sell a Dedicated-Thing; And, makes you, by plaine reason, see How false the claimes of Tyrants bee. Then, having took some Blocks away, Which stop the Kings repentance may; Provokes thereto; and (though the root Seems bitter) warrants pleasent fruit. When, in his might, the Dogstar, raigned, here, And, when our City, and our Armies, were Made jealous of each other, by their wiles, Who, sought to nourish Discord in these Iles. Fill'd full of Thoughts, and sad, and sleeplesse lying Upon my Couch there, silently, surveying With contemplations eyes, the sick estate Of these three Kingdomes, and, their likely Fate; My rambling Fancie (which was newly come, From whence I know not) brought into the room, A reverend Person, who, upon him wore, A Sea-green mantle, which was wrought all o're With silver wavings (well resembled those Which curle the Ocean, when a strong gale blowes) And, had a Verge, or bordering imbost Of Rock-work, like the cliffs, that guard our cost. Rais'd with white Saphirs, looking o're a strand, Bestrow'd with orient Pearls, and golden sand. In his left hand, he seem'd to bring with him A threefold, but a broken Diadem, Each third whereof contained counterfeits, Of many differing shaped Coronets, (Which had adorned it) most part of which Seem'd also, broken, or defaced much; And, not improperly, an emblem were Of something, which this Emperie may feare. With an heroick look, a Princely pace, And awefull presence, entred he the place: But, so, that look, and pace, and presence, had A shadowing drawne over them, which made Appearance, of a heart displeas'd, and sorry; Yet, gave it, rather, excellence and glory To his demeanure, then diminishment, Of what, beseem'd a Person excellent. Nor heeding me; nor seeming much to care Who, then, was present, or, who was not there, A turne or two, he walk'd; rais'd to the skies, As one admiring, his majestick eyes; And, with hands elevated, and display'd Thus, like a much displeased friend, he said, SEE, SEE! how MISCHIEF, like the Lernean Snake, Renewes her heads, and still new life doth take! The fire of WAR within our fields did flame, A while agoe, and Gods hand quench'd the same. The match and powder were together laid In our chiefe City; and, he, also staid Those probable effects, which could have shooke These Ilands, if the project, then, had took. As soone as that was past, another Traine Was closely laid, to blow up all againe; And, make these Nations, like the clod-borne brood Of Cadmus, broachers of each others blood. Is there no end of madnesse? but, by fits, Must they, who should be wisest, loose their wits? And, still be forging new Designes and Gins, To plague themselves, and others, for their sins? Will not, the blind, selfe-seeking parties, leave, Snares for themselvs, with their own hands to weave? Will not the Serpent cease to bruise their heels, Whom he pursues, though broken heads he feels? Nor will the harmlesse Doves, become so wise To know the Birds of prey, through their disguise, Till they are all beguiled with their showes, And, quite devour'd, by Buzzard, Kites and Crowes? Shall wholsome counsell, alwaies, be withstood? And, will you reinvolve your selves in blood, What ever your best friends indeavour can, And, as it were, in spight of GOD and man? O GOD! what dulnesse hath possest these Nations? When shall the Spirit of Infatuations, Be dispossest, ye Britans? when shall peace Unite your hearts? when shall dissention cease, And, we behold againe within my Coast, Those blessings, which they willfully have lost, Who, sleighted counsell, when it was in season; And, yet, resolve, not to be rul'd by Reason? How long! oh Lord! how long shall they neglect The Teachers of a better intellect, And, in those courses frowardly persist, Whereby, they must arrive at had I wist? How long! shall that contagious Cloud of lies Which through the streets, almost each morning flies On paper wings, with slanders, poyson some? To others, instruments of death, become? Corrupt weake judgements? Interrupt the choice Of good things? drown the Pacyfying-voice Which, to their great advantage, they might hear, Unlesse deaf-Adder like, they stopt their eare? Or, listened to those falshoods, weich delude The wisest, and enrage the multitude? How long! shall men persever to delight In cursed words, and actions of despight? In studying reciprocall disgraces? In flinging durt into each others faces? And, as it were, in striving, who best may The Devills part, upon cach other play. How long! will you in an unhappy course, Run from one bad extreme, into a worse? How long! will you pretend, protest, and vow, To be reform'd, yet, nothing better grow? How long! will you condemne what others do, Yet tread their paths, yea go beyond them, too, And think ye shall enough your selves commend, To publish, wherein others do offend? Or punish them, whose crimes but veniall be, When Capitall Transgressors may go free? How long! will you observe the scorners Fate, Yet, never, mend, before it be too late? How long! shall God forbear? how long! for you Befoole the wise, yet fooles no wiser grow? How long! shall he keep off a Forraigne pow'r, While you, at home, each other to devour, And seek, by ev'ry new Deliverance, Your owne Designes, and profits to advance? As if the publike Mercies, which GOD sends, Were all vouchsafed for your private ends? How long! will you lie underneath the stroke, Yet, his displeasure ev'ry day provoke? Or being frighted from what was misdone, Commit the same fault, when the fear is gone? How long! shall prudence preach a safer way, Yet, you renew your dangers, day, by day? And, though you, still are told what will succeed. Still carelesse be, of taking, timely, heed? How long! will you good principles with-stand, And fortifie with pebble stones and sand? Or paper workes, or stubble-structures frame, When, round about you, all is in a flame? And, at the givers of good counsell, jeere, That others, may be fooled as you are? How long! will ye, whilst your blind-Harpers play Divisions, Jigs, and Fancies, dance the Hay, And, breake each others heads, and shins, and faces, At Blind-man-buffe, (aswel to your disgraces As to your losse and smart) whilst most about you, Both for your madnesse, and your follies, flout you? And whilst thereby your adversaries gaine That, which they could not, otherwaies obtaine? How long! will you permit, Ambition, pride, Selfe-love or Avarice to be your guide? And persevere to trust, and to commit Your being, unto some who have nor wit, Nor grace, nor modesty? as if he had Forsworne good counsell, and, a Covenant made VVith your oppressors, to resigne all pow'r To them, who seek to prey on what is your? And, still to prostitute your free Elections To strengthen private ends, and nourish Factions? How long will they, on whom your trust is plac't, Put off, what should be first, untill the last? How long will they irresolute appeare Whereto they should undoubtedly adhere, And, thereby keep, from knitting fast together, Divided parts, till there be strength in neither To reunite? Or, till all teare asunder, Like Clouds disperst, by their own in-bred Thunder? How long shall Knave be Trump? &amp; all the Cards Be pack't, to give unmerited rewards? Or, deale forth undeservedly, to those Who are best friends, the portion of your Foes? And, O! how long shall such men play your Game, Who have betray'd, who will betray the same, And, still promote (though better be profest) A Private, or, a Forraigne Interest? Hear, O ye Islands! harken and beleeve, Your Genius, who, doth see your waies, and greeve, If you shall act, much longer, as ye do, Your City, Army, Priest, and People too; Your King, your chosen Commons, and your Peers, Your Independents, and your Presbyters, The worst disposed, and the best affected; The faithfull, and the man of fraud detected; The Freind, the Foe, the Foole, and he that's wise; The Rich, and he who at his threshold lies; English, Scot, Welsh, and Kerne, shall all together So jumbled be, so juggle with each other, So stagger from their Principles, and Friends, Through foolish hopes false feares, or private ends; That most shall be deceived, and, undone, To make a winning-Game for Lookers on. For, these have eyes upon you; and expect, From your encreasing Discords, an effect To their advantage: These, rejoyce to see How senslesse of your owne true peace, you be; How frowardly you act to your own cost, And, play for them, that Game which they had lost. With serious, if sleight things I may compare, Ye, Britans are now playing (as it were) A Game at Cards: for there are many faces, Among you, like Kings, Queens, Tens, and Aces, Beside the Vulgar pack; and much strange dealing, Strange shuffling, and strange cutting, (worth revealing) Is veiw'd, whereby the publike hath had wrong, (And many private persons) over-long. Some, by the Players; others by the Foxes, Who have obtain'd the keeping of your Boxes; Some, by their want of skill; and some by betting Upon both sides; by violence, or cheating, Are like no share at last, what you to lose; Then, laugh to scorne, your Folly in the close; Because, you good advantages did sleight And, plaid your Game no better, when ye might. How have ye lost, what you had lately got? When all men saw, you had the better lot? Of Hearts and Diamonds, you a while ago, As faire Games had, as any hand could show: But, some by-standers, who, your cards can view, Are much afraid, that now ye have but few. Of Spades and Clubs, yet (if well paid) ye have Enough at least, whereby your stakes to save. Ye had, but of one Queen, a diffidence; And, shee was plaid away, a good while since: The Knaves are shared so by either side, That, little odds betwixt you is espi'd; And, they, who yet seem Newters, (out of play) At last, may serve to count upon, some way. One King, alone, you have; and what to do With him, a friend of yours could tell you too, But that he is no Player, and he hath spoke, Already, more, then many have well took. Yet this I'le say; you cannot make your Game, By all the Kings, and Court-Cards, you could name, As by well playing him. As you dispose Of him, so, you are like to win, or lose: So, ye shall either gaine or misse, your ends; So, you shall multiply your Foes or Friends: GOD, give you grace to take the safest way; VVhich, (if vaine hopes delude not) yet, ye may. And, GOD, direct him, and incline him too So prudently to suffer, and to doe, That, he pursue no more sinister ends: For, at this present, upon him depends The Fortune of his House: And, therewithall Shall many other, either stand, or fall, VVhose Fates are yet, by very few discerned To be in his well-doing much concerned: Yea, thereupon, dependeth greater things, Then are the Risings, and the Falls of Kings. My Spirit, therefore, groanes within my brest, And, is with violent desires opprest, That, he, and they, who seem yet stupifi'd, Might wake out of their Dreamings, to provide, Against those many mischiefs, which of late, Have menaced the ruine of this State: And, seeing, by a neare relation, I Am more oblig'd then any Stander-by, To seeke your welfare, and prevent your woe, I'le give such hints of what you ought to doe, As are permitted; O! take therefore heed, Of what ye now shall either hear or read: For, without Riddles, I will plainely tell, VVhat courses ye may follow, and doe well. First, let your erring, and deluded King, Himselfe, his Crowns, and Scepters humbly bring, And, lay them at his feet, to whom, alone, Belongs the supreme Glorie of each Throne. For, GOD, will not be mock'd: (though for a space He winks at many, who neglect his Grace) But, will on every one, avengement take Who, in his wickednesse doth progresse make. Let him acknowledge that Supermacie, And falling downe, before that Majesty, Which is offended, ask to be forgiven For his offence against both earth and heaven. And, that he may obtain it, let him weigh What Common Fame unto his charge doth lay; What just occasion he hath given, why Things are suspected, which ye may deny; And, what his heart may justly smite him for; Till, all his errors he doth so abhor, That GGD may pardon them; and men may see, His Grace is greater, then their sinnes can bee. That this be truly done, let him not spare To make his Failings, truly, what they are, By, secretly, anatomizing them, In every circumstance, 'twixt God and him: For, in the world, it hath not yet been knowne, That any King was cast out of his Throne, Without a crying-sinne: Or, that God shooke A Kingdome; or a Nation, ever strooke; Or humbled any man, for his offence, And re-advanced, without Penitence: Except, when he, in wrath, did them restore, To make their sufferings, and their shame the more. Which, that he may prevent; let him delay No longer, from a penitentiall way: But, make return, before he run so far, As to become a pris'ner at the Insula Vectis. BAR. Or, let him take good heed, when he is there, Lest other mens designs, and his own fear, Or, such vaine hopes, as he hath had too long, Occasion him to fall (by stearing wrong) On Scylla, or Charybdis: Or, least, they Who, seek their own advantage, him betray By practise underhand: For, such as these Will but prolong their owne: and his Disease, With harme to others; and exasperate Those humours, which will hasten on the Fate, That may be fear'd. Thus, therefore, let him do, Yea, doe it quickly, and sincerely too. Let him, a while, withdraw himselfe, apart, (Ev'n to the secret closet of his heart) Excluding company, but chiefly, them Who, from his Duties, long have hindred him, By wicked counsells; or, by flattery; Caus'd him to dote upon a Majesty Which is not reall; and have thereby, turned His glory into shame, and made him scorned. Let him, shut out all those that shew unto him, Those pictures of himselfe, which may undo him; And, make him, like Narcissus, on a Bable To dote, till he be fool'd into a Fable, For, some, with so much Piety, besaint him; With such fain'd Excellencies they bepaint him; Yea, they so impudently magnifie him, And, with so much Divinity bely him, As if, to deifie him they profest; Or, else, to canonize him, at the least. And, but, that thousands know him; and, know too, How much, men flatter Kings, (and what they do Who idolize them) some would halfe beleeve He were, not only, blamelesse, but conceive That, seldome such a King, or such a man, Had raign'd, or liv'd, since first the world began; And, that these Kingdomes, have afflicted been, Without his fault; yea, for the peoples sin Against his God-head, onely: And, this course Hath made him nothing better; but, much worse; For Pharoah-like, it him, still more obdures, And, ev'ry day, new sins, new plagues procures. Let him, with prudent anger, therefore throw Such cheating Glasses from him; and, those too, Which multiply the faults by others done; And, represent offences, which are none, In hope to make themselves the fairer seem, By casting blurs, on other mens esteem: For these Impostors cheat him, with false showes, That, he to save their Stakes, himselfe may lose. Let him take heed of their Compliances, Who are declined from those Principles, Whereby, they in meere conscience, and true zeale. Appeared active for the Common-Weal, Against his Int'rest; and, in show or won A counter course, in their Designes to run, In aid of his desires, with hope of those Rewards, or Honours, which he shall propose: For, on such giddy Turne-coats, all his cost, Time, promises, and favours, will be lost, Both to himselfe and them; Because those flashes, Are but a smoake, rais'd out of Dust, and Ashes, And shap'd unto a Cloud; which being fill'd, With noysome Aire, and, thereby, vainly swell'd, Up to a shew of something, shall, at last, Vanish to nothing by a suddain Blast. Let him consider, what sad desolations His wilfulnesse hath brought upon three Nations; Upon himselfe, and Children; what great fears And sorrowes he hath heap'd, now, many years, On others too, aswell as upon them, Whose peace, and weal, he ought not to contemne: Let him take notice, with how little sense, Of their Afflictions, and of their expence In Blood and Treasure, he hath passed over Those losses which he never can recover. And let him ponder what may more befall, Unlesse the pow'r of God prevent it shall. Let him observe to what despised things, Below the honour, not alone, of Kings, But, of Inferiour Persons, he is brought, By seeking that, which he in vaine hath sought; By list'ning to bad Counsell; and, by still Pursuing those beginnings which were ill. Let him impartially resolve in mind, To what conditions it hath him confin'd; What heights of Glorie it hath cast him from; To what a depth of Troubles, he is come; What meanly-qualified Groomes, of late, He hath been faine, disguis'd, to personate; What triviall Fellowes he is forc'd to feed, Ride, and converse with: yea, let him take heed, From what sleight Jockies, and what Scatter-wits, He seeketh aid, and thereby nothing gets, To further his designes; nor ought but Lies, Rodomantadoes, and such Vanities. Nay, let him mark it once, and then againe, What beggerly Companions he is faine To fawne upon; to humour, bribe, and woe, With promises, of wealth, and honour too, To serve his ends, when thereto they can add No more, then from a Porter may be had; Except it, peradventure, be Returnes Of ruine on themselves, and, on him scornes. Let him examine, by himselfe, alone, What he committed hath, or left undone, For which this change befalls him; And not dream That, these afflictions have pursued him For other mens transgressions altogether, And let him seriously consider, whether There can be hearty penitence, or no, For wrongs, without some satisfaction too, Let him examine, if a sacrifice Of words, and protestations, may suffice For bloodsheds, and those many robberies, Which on his Person, and his Party lies: Or, whether he, and his Prerogatives Were ever worth so many thousand lives, As they have cost: or, whether, when to make His last accompt, he cometh, GOD will take So triviall an answer, as to say; His will, and pleasure, they would not obey; But rebells were, who did that power resist, Which he doth claime, of doing what he list As his Vicegerent, and, as he wrs taught By those, whom he, to be true Prophets thought. Let him consider, what best guards a Throne, And, keeps him safest, who doth sit thereon; By whom, Kings raigne; why they at first were made; And, for whose sakes, authority they had: That, he may not suppose GOD, did provide His Kingdome, only to advance his pride: Or, to inflict an heavy curse, upon Whole Nations, by inslaving all to one. Let him consider, in what infamies A Tyrant lives, in what uncertainties, Fears, doubts, and dangers: and with what esteem, Content and peace, he wares his Diadem, Who raignes, as knowing, that he had his Crown More, for his peoples sake, then for his own. And, let him kick away those Parasites, Whose Counsell to Oppression, him invites; Or, foolishly perswades him, to improve Pow'r, wealth, or pleasure, by the losse of love. And, thereby, makes him labour to enjoy That pow'r, which will at last himself destroy. Let him consider, soberly, if he In honour, or in conscience bound may be Himself, for those, to hazard, who pretended His Honour, and his Rights, to have befriended; Whereas, it may, (by many a circumstance) Be made appeare, that, at their owne advance They chiefly aim'd; or, to prevent the Lot, Which, they had by his Grace, already got. For, to prevent approaching Beggery, Some strength'ned him in acts of Tyranny; Some, to disturb the waters, that in them, They might be thriving Fishers, under him. And very few (what e're they counterfeit) To him adhered, but, to save, or get. Or, though their love ingaged them; yet, none Is bound to more, then can by him be done: Nor is it just, that he, himself should lose, Because, he wanteth pow'r, to save all those Who stood with him ingaged: Nor, would they Desire it, if they lov'd him, as they say. Let him not trust to those fanatick things, Who, dote upon the Accidents of Kings, And sleight their Essence: For, as hitherto These, by their aid, did but themselves undo Without his benefit; so shall it bee Hereafter, till their errour they can see. There is no help in humane policy, Nor any way, but down-right honesty To his security; or to redeem Their happinesse who have assisted him: For ev'ry course, and politike designe That, shall be drawne out, by a crooked line, Will but beget new mischiefs, and inforce New projects, whose effects will still be worse; Till spight of pow'r, and fraud, long swords, and daggers, He stand enrowl'd among the Royall Beggers; Or, with those Kings, who, from their honour fell, Because, they sleighted those, who wish'd them well. Let, him not fancy, that their seeming love, Who Court him, yet, will worth regarding prove, Though, daily more and more they shall repaire To kisse his hand; or, fill the empty aire With acclamations; or, although they may Upon his birth, or Coronation day Make Bonefires, ring the bells, drink healths unto him, And such like triviall, and rude honours do him; For, herein, these, act but a sensuall part, Delightfull to themselves, without a heart: Some, to expresse their present discontent, And dis-affection to the Parliament: Some, for selfe-ends; some out of levity, And, many other, they well know not why, Seem zealous of his honour, who would soone, Repent what, they now covet-should be done, Were he restor'd unto them, with that mind Whereto, as yet, he seems to be inclin'd; And, they who do this day Hosanna crie, Would say, perhaps, to morrow, Crucifie. The common People, rather live by sense, Then reason; and so quickly take offence At present suffrings, that they oft are pleas'd To cut their own throats, that they may be eas'd. And, when it shall distast their Fantasies, Will tread on what they did Idolatrize. If, therefore, he would in their love confide, And gaine from them affections which will bide; He must protect, them from receiving wrong, In things, which to their Freedomes do belong: Of their proprieties, he must take care; And, that their Persons and their purse he spare, Till he shall need them; and untill they see How for his honour, and their good 'twill bee: For, they will then, be forwarder to give, Then he shall be to ask, or to receive; And, when just cause the same occasion may, Fling, for his sake, both goods and lives away. Let this be then his aime, and his intent, When God shall joyn him with his Parliament; With Justice, let him round impale his Throne, And, set before it, like King Solomon, A guard of Lions, that, may keep away Those Apes, Baboons, and Foxes, which assay Thereon to make intrusions; or, devise How to invade him, with such flatteries, As may delude him; and, divert him from Those Duties, which his Dignity become. All his Prerogatives, likewise, let him So mix with equity; so, circle them With pious Charmes; and, so confine, and awe His Vassals, by Example, and by Law, That, in all times to come, nor he, nor they Who shall succeed him, find occasions may To dim his glory, or his pow'r to shake; Or, on the Subjects right, a breach to make. So, shall the people their just claimes enjoy, So, you, who do each other now destroy, Shall in each others happinesse delight, And, raise your Mountaine to a glorious height. What, can he more desire, then to excell Among those people, with whom all is well? Whither can he aspire, but to possesse On earth, the chiefest earthly happinesse? And, what can he have lesse, then he now gaines By seeking more, then to a King pertaines? But, lest, what his good Genius would advise, He may, by meanes of their deceits despise, Who have the Jannes and the Jambres been, By whose enchantments, he continues in Obduratenesse: Let him, take speciall care Of those false Priests, and Prophets to beware, Who sooth him up with lies; and, make him dream, That, by endangering his Crowne for them He should preserve it; and, that, to provide Large meanes to feed their gluttony and pride, Is to promote GODS glory; let him not Believe those truthlesse vanities, a jot. Though some good men, have heretofore been fed With Babels portions, and unforfeited, Preserv'd their innocence, (with much ado) Yet, now, those dainties, have corrupted so This Generation; that there's cause to doubt Their Charmes. And, therefore, let him shut them out From heart, and eare, (what ever formall shew Of Sanctity, they make in outward veiw) Believing, that their chiefe intentions here, Are to repair their breaches; or, endeare, And sweeten, to the ruine of this Nation, Those Philters, and that cup of fornication, Whereby, their Scarlet Mistresse, giddifies All those, who listen to her Witcheries. Let him, above all others, take good heed Of these deceivers: adde this to his Creed Concerning them: ev'n this, that they are not Gods Prophets; that, God ownes not for his lot, That they so call, and, that, though him they raise Above the Moone, with attributes of praise; It is, but for the service of the Dragon, Their Lust, their great Diana, or their Dagon, That, they so court him: yea, though they adore The seat he sits on, as divine (or more) And, canonize him (as it were) for one, Who, all his Predecessors had out-gone In piety, (because, he stoutly stands To keep them with full guts, and idle hands) Let him not be deceiv'd; nor think so glorious, So honourable, or, so meritorious, What he would do for them, (if he were able) For, Jesabel did feed, at her owne table, Eight hundred Prophets; and, appear'd no doubt, In her owne way, as bounteously devout, As he would be: yet, did her superstition, With other sinnes, occasion her perdition: And they were but false Prophets, whom she fed, Who shortly, after, likewise perished. Hypocrisie. and superstition, may Be sooner flattered by such as they, Into stupendious-bounties, then you see The best men can, by true devotion be: And, this, the Sacrifices, Altars, Groves, Shrines, Idols, Temples, and that Bounty proves, Which hath been dedicated unto men, To Angells, and to Devills, now and then. Then, let him, not their Praises prize; nor feare, Against their claimes, that covenant to sweare, Which is establish'd by his Parliament, Their mischievous encrochments to prevent: For, though they have made captive his esteem; Not only to their callings, but to them; Nor they, nor that (once theirs) now, sold and bought, Are so divine, as they would have them thought. Yea, though these call it sacriledge, in those Who, to discharge the publike debts, dispose What was of late, employed, but to feed Bel and the Dragon; and, would scruples breed Within his conscience, making him beleeve, That GOD, is rob'd, if others do receive What, lately they possest (and have too long Usurp'd already, to the publike wrong.) Let neither King, nor people, be afraid Of what by these Impostors, hath been said, To save their Kitchenstuffe; and, that their back Hereafter, may not their soft raiment lack. Let him not fearfull be to sell, ot buy Those portions, in their great necessity, Unlesse they sell, or buy them, with a mind, To prey on others rights; or, are inclin'd To have them though they think it may be sin; And whether right, or wrong be done therein: For, such a man himselfe doth guilty make Of Sacriledge, though but his owne he take. A true Disciple, doubtlesse may injoy Things carnall; and whilst them he doth imploy As he is bound, none ever grudges him Their use; nor doth him, in their use, condemne: But, when, his own false int'rest to advance, He shall mis-name it, Christ's inheritance, Or otherwise shall mis-imploy the same Against Truths Friends, and honor of GOD's name; He forfeits what he had. Moreover, know, That Christ, whose service they pretend unto, Bequeath'd them no such Lordships, as they claime: Nor Salaries, like those, at which they aime: But giving them Cmmmission (whom he sent His work to do) injoyned them content With his allowance; strictly charged them, To trust to none, for wages, but to Him: And, to expect their Labours hire from none, (Or any where) but, where the work is done. But, see, how great a difference now appears Betwixt these Priests, and Christ's Commissioners: So impudently they do now presume The Titles, and the Wages, to assume, Which were forbid; so largely, they provide, Not necessaries onely, but for pride, For luxury, and for magnificence, Beyond the limits of a modest Prince; So loose at their deportments, and so vaine; Such Ruffians and Buffoones they entertaine: Of common faults, and of each crying sin, So manifestly guilty, some have been; So peevish are they, so uncharitable; Amid their plenty, so inhospitable; So ignorant, they have been otherwhile, And their Apostleships do so defile; That, to suppose CHRISTS Officers were such As they appear, were in effect, as much As to professe, his Kingdome were become Terrestriall, and his Court, indeed, at Rome; And, he who shall receive these, in the name Of CHRISTS Disciples, will receive but shame. 'Tis pitie, that their Bounty, who were Nurses To piety, at first; and, who, their purses So prodigally empti'd, to endow The needy Saints, should so perverted grow; And, that, men were so gracelesse in their use Of Blessings, as to lose them by abuse. Yet, just it was, that they who did suppose GODS bounty, not enough; their owne, should lose. And, that, gifts which he gave not; and, which may Pervert his purpose, should be took away; (At least) when their possessors do begin, To turne, what flow'd from vertue, into sin. And, how could you imploy their vast wealth better, Then, to discharge that, wherein you were debter By their default, who, sought to have destroy'd Your Birth-rights, by that wealth which they enjoy'd? Since, Offrings made to GOD, (and, which to owne, He doth accept) may be on men bestowne, In times of need, when mercy, justly cries To be prefer'd, before a Sacrifice. Thus, did, without reproofe, the Jewish Kings By, otherwhile, with Dedicated things, Their Kingdomes peace; and purchas'd uncontrold, Their Liberties with sanctified Gold; So, with their wealth, by whom your wars begun To pay the Souldier, you have justly done. But, that your King more plainely may espy His disobligement, to the Prelacy; (Which comprehends those Boutefeu's, by whom He, and his people, are almost become The ruine of each other) Be it knowne; These, were, at first, no creatures of his owne, Or, of his Predecessors; though, they gain'd A legall Oath, by them to be maintain'd, As part of holy Church; and, though a while, They sate among the Peerage of this Isle. But, they were first created, to promote The Kingdome of the BEAST, and, to devote Their services to him, in raising high, In making strong, and large, his Emperie; Or, in debasing Kings; and, how, they did Performe that service, you in stories read. Now, when for bloody tyranny, from hence, That Tyrant was expell'd, by Providence, These also, (if they had not been befriended) Had into banishment, their Chief, attended. But, they pretending to a Reformation, (Perhaps, to keep possession in this Nation, For their grand Signior; and, to bring to passe What, now of late, almost effected was,) Obtained grace: And, proving to be fit For their ambition, who aspire to get An arbitrary pow'r, they did arise Almost to all their former dignities; And, grew so active, and, so wise became In playing of the Kings, and their owne game, That, here, (as plainly as in France) we see There's no such Tyrants; as where Prelates bee. And, he, perhaps, did mean the self-same thing, Who us'd to say, no Bishops, and no King. They were advanc'd, like Jeroboams Priests, But to preserve usurped Interests Upon the people; and to help encrease Those claimes which Tyrants covet to possesse, By falsifying Charters and Commissions, From Sacred Writ, to justifie oppressions: And Jurisdictions, to that end, they had, To force, when wit they wanted, to perswade. Then, to oblige the more, and, that they might Be like to Jeroboams Priests, outright; They, from the poorest, and the basest sort Of people, rose, to highest place in Court. This is their Jus divinum, whatsoe're Their friends, or they, would make themselves appear: Which, by clear demonstration, I make good, And, not by tales of Tubs, and Robin-Hood. Thus, what they were; and, what they had to do, And, what at best their pride hath brought them to, I have declared; that, your King no more May cheated be by them, as heretofore: Or, think, that Law, or Conscience, him obliges, To keep up their usurped Priviledges, But, thereby know, that, if he shall delight In that, which is indeed the Royall-right; He, their vaine services, no more, will need, And, joy, that from such Flatt'rers he is freed. If any shall object, that, he hath took An Oath on their behalfe; that might be spoke Aswell of Kings, perhaps, who took away Old Idol Preisthoods: For, 'tis likely, they Vow'd their protection, when the policy Of Jeroboam rais'd his Hi'rarchy To fix the Kingdome. But, no Oaths oblige, Which in unlawfull actions would ingage: And, his Oath is not broke by him, who took it, When, that, which made it lawfull, doth revoke it. If it be said, those things to God were given, Which they possest. What then? in earth, and heav'n, God, is the sole possesser of all things; And, (whatsoever any takes, or brings) Hath neither more nor lesse; nor doth allow That any place on earth, or portion, now, Of things meere earthly, should be made appeare More holy, or more his, then others are; For, man intitling GOD, to mens estates, Is, but a Priest-cheat, which he greatly hates. When, you give more to God, then he commands, His Thanks is; Who requir'd it at your hands? Nor doth he those Oblations ever prize, Which from a superstitious ground arise; Nor counts, a charitable deed made void, When gifts abused, better are imploy'd. Oh! let not then his hazzards to preserve Their temp'rall claimes, be more then they preserve. Let him not tire himselfe to change a boot, Which he may weare with ease, on either foot. Let him not, by his undue care of these Which were the chiefest cause of his disease, Against his owne just Int'rest make him erre, By seeking their advancements to preferre Before his owne well-being. Let him not Permit their formall wisedome to besot His understanding so, that he shall scorne This Counsell; or, continue to adjourne Compliance with his people in those things Which are the Cement betwixt them and Kings; And, will be so approved, maugre that Which, to deceive him, they both print, and prate. Let him not trust to their enchanting Spells, Nor to the braine of their Achitophells; For, if faint, or false-heartednesse in those Who, for the Publike, his attempts oppose, Shall not for private, or, by-interest Betray the cause and trust they have profest; GOD, at this present time, will lower bring The tyrannizing pow'r of Priest, and King. Nor King-craft, Priest-craft, nor the policies Of all, who preach or fight by tyrannies, Shall long prevaile, though, to support each other All Europes Tyrants should unite together: But, GOD, when they suppose to reach the tops Of their designs, will frustrate all their hopes; And, cause them to perceive, that he intends To prosper that, whereto they are no friends. Before that day, from all equivocations, From all close ends, and mentall Reservations, Let Charles, begin a resolute retreat; Else (MARK this) when sev'n years he shall compleat Among the Beasts, with Nebuchadnezar, Th'event of his demurrers will appear: And, he, who, yet a Leadstar, might become, Of just Dominion, to all Christendome, Shall misse the best advantage offred, yet, To any, King, who on his Throne did sit. Though clouds rise in the South, and in the North; There is a Doome-conditionall, gone forth To be reverst, or stand, as he shall, now, His want of prudence, or, his wisedome show, As when the Sun ascends, to run his race, From his ecclipsed honour, and disgrace, He, now, may rise; whereas, if he passe by The present offred opportunity, He may perhaps, begin the fatall dance, Which ev'ry King must foot, who doth advance Himselfe above his bound. He, may, now, make Their expectations frustrate, who, yet, take An old prediction, in that sense, which he Would be unwilling so fulfill'd should be. For, through these Islands this Tradition goes, That He, who made the English Damask Rose, Or, else some other, being curious growne, To know the future fortune of his Throne, Receiv'd, in hieroglyphick-wise exprest, Their Portraitures, who, when he was at rest, Should in his Kingdome, after him succeed; With words, in Latine Verse, thus Englished: A Man, a Child, a Furious-One; Vir, puer, &amp;c. A Maid, a Fox, a Lion, None. I would not, any much should trust, or feare Such Prophecies; yet, when events appeare To answer unto that, which was fore-told, Wise-men should make what use of them they could: Seek how they might extract, ev'n from the Devills Deceits, an antidote, against his evills; And, so direct their actions, that his Charmes And cheating riddles, may not do them harmes. Lo, that prediction, is this day fulfill'd; Six, as it was fore-typifi'd, have held The Scepter of that King; and, now there's none, Who either weares the Crowne, or fills the Throne; Nor, any thing to furnish out the same Belonging to that race, except a Name: And, here shall end that Prophesie, unlesse It further be fulfild through wilfulnesse. If he, who ownes that name, shall harken to Their counsell, who will tell him what to do; That name, at last, much like that stamp, may be Which was preserved, when the Royall-tree, Once, representing Nebuchadnezzar, Was felled down. And, as he did appear In former Glorie, when he had confest His failings, and the living God profest; So, shall it be with Charles, if he repent; God, will the ruine of his House prevent; Restore him to his Throne, and make his fame To grow the fairer, through his present shame. But, if he shall defer, till 'tis too late, Let him prepare for King Belshazzars fate, And, let all those, who shall to him adhere, Expect, in his sad dooms to have a share. As Samuel did for Saul, till God did fling That Tyrant off, and chose another King; So shall I pray for him (with mourning too) Till I perceive what GOD, and he will do. And, therefore, touching him, I will (before I speak to others) utter somwhat more. By no externall symptoms, can I find That, he doth yet, begin to change his mind; But, so, in his first march proceedeth on, As if, he wrongs receiv'd, but none had done. And, whereas GOD, for penitence doth call, Doth seem to think, there needeth none at all; But, rather, that his people (if not heav'n) Should supplicate, to be of him forgiven, For suffring, such an Innocent as he, So scandalized, and so wrong'd to be. Yea, and the people (as it is their guize) When some offender at the gallowes dies, Whom they themselves brought thither, do begin To look more on the streight that he is in, Then, on the reason of it. And as when A Township, having seized guilty men, Who had much wrong'd their servants, stole their goods, Devour'd their cattell, sometime shed their bloods, And, threatned their destruction; in a rage They force them to the stocks, or to the cage, Or to the Justice, and are like to teare The Rogues in pieces, too, ere they come there: But, when they are examin'd; and when they Must, at their Parish charges them convey Unto the Goale; be bound to prosecute; Take paines, and spend some money in the suit, That Justice may be done (the Land to free From such a plague as those were like to bee) Then, if the Rascals whine (as they will do) And make their moan, they faine would let them go. Thus, fares it with the people; they complain'd Against the King, of wrongs by him sustain'd, And, of worse like to come. They saw, he drew The Sword upon them, therewith to pursue His Usurpations; and, they were compel'd, To arm, and to oppose him in the field; Where, GOD, the victory bestow'd on them; And, in their own defence, they conquer'd him. Then, finding, that this Conquest drew on charge, And, that it further would their cost inlarge To keep what they have got, (lest all the cost And blood already wasted, should be lost, And worse things follow) they impatient grow, And, are discourag'd, and besotted so, That, they begin to pity his estate More then themselves; to scandalize, and hate Ev'n their Deliverances; to underprize GODS mercies, their own safety to despise; And, to behave themselves, as if they had An inclination in them to be mad About next Moon in Iune: Or, had their Doome In spight of their Defenders, to become Perpetuall slaves: And, this base Generation, (Foes to themselves, and to their own salvation) Have so confirm'd the Kings obduracy, By their imprudence, and apostacy, That, he, perhaps, perswades himselfe, there needs No penitence for any of his deeds Against the publike Rights; and that his ends To compasse, this vain Rout will yeeld him friends. Now, therefore, all excuses to prevent, Though I have shew'd, whereof he should repent; Informed how; and in some part, of what; Yet, here Ile touch a little more of that, That He, and they who think him without blame, May somewhat now consider of the same. Deserves it no repentance, to invade Those priviledges which his people had? And those proprieties, which they injoy'd In their estates, unjustly, to make void, Or, from their antient freedomes, them to thrust? Or, from their due possessions for his lust? Or, maintenance for luxury and pride, By other mens undoings, to provide? And, then by Proclamation, to pretend Some necessary, and some publike end, Which, could be manifest to no mans veiw, And, which, was generally knowne untrue? Was it no sinne, by base Monopoles, To raise the price of most commodities? To take away free trades and occupations; To vex men with perpetuall Molestations, By Courts and Officers, devis'd for nought But, that men into bondage might be brought To his Prerogatives? and by degrees By new exactions, Services, and Fees, Be screw'd up, (through demands, appearing small) Till he hath got a seeming right in all? For if that be his due, which was receiv'd; So, is the rest, if Priests may beleiv'd. Was it no fault, deserving penitence, To take away the meanes of their defence, From his most faithfull Subjects? to ingrosse And, raise the price of powder, to their losse, And their apparent danger? to disarme Their persons, who intended him no harme? To put them under the command of those Who are their knowne Oppressors and their Foes? To make them lend what he ne're meant to pay? To make them buy what he should give away? To make them give, who had no list thereto; To make them sell, what they would not forgo? To act, what may of all their dues deprive them? And to deny them that, which should relieve them? Deserves it not a sigh, that in his Court Prophanenesse, and Oppressions, were but sport? That, Judges were compell'd to wrest the Lawes? Divines the Scriptures, to maintaine a Cause Which GOD abhorres; that all oppressions should Be there upheld, and sin be uncontrold? That School-boyes not arriv'd at years of reason, Should suffer death, as culpable of Treason, For childish words; as if Kings grew afraid Through guiltinesse, of what young Infants said? Deserves it not bewailing, to repaire By fines, unjustly rais'd, the House of prai'r? To punish, men of merit, with disgraces, Dismembrings, Stigmatizing of their faces, Imprisonments, exiles, and separations From friends, wives, children, yea, from all relations, For things not capitall; or, deemed crimes, By Law; or, blamable in better times? Was nothing done, whereof he might repent, When ev'n the speaking of a Parliament, Was made a crime? when Members were confin'd, For doing what by duty was injoyn'd; When all their Priviledges were so broke, That, some should violently have been tooke, Ev'n from their Sanctuary; which, of old To violate, no Tyrant was so bold: And for which act, alone, this free born Nation, Would quite have ruin'd all his Generation, In former times; if, they had ere obtain'd So great advantages, as now are gain'd? Deserves it no repentance, to bestow Those honours which to virtue he doth owe, On vitious men? Or, such as had no worth But, wealth and arrogance, to set them forth? Or, could be instruments to help undo Their honest neighbours, and the Kingdome too? Is it no wrong, to set such Rascalls, over Their well knowne betters, that they may uncover, And rise, and bow, before them; who, are fitter To lacky by their horse, Caroch, or Litter? Or, rather to be baffled, kick'd and scorned, Then, with a Coronet to be adorned? Was nothing purpos'd, fit to be repented, When that Designe was first of all invented, Which, to promote, (and, thereby to inforce) He sent both for Commanders and for Horse, To Germany? And, was there nothing plotted, When on our Seas that Spanish Navy floted, Which anchor'd in the Downes? Is there no teare, Or sigh due, for those things which acted were Concerning Rochell; whereof, to this day, The Protestants of France complaine, and say, It cannot be, but, that both GOD, and Man Will vengeance bring, for what they suffred then? Is there no need of penitentiall prayers, For innovating of the Scotch-affaires? For doing, and undoing? For complying, And falling off? For granting, and denying? For all those falsifyings which fore-went The first, the second, and this Parliament? For all those injuries, which have been since? For all the acts of fraud, and violence, Committed in these Islands, since this Warre, By him, and those, which of his party are? For all these, is there no compunction due, Which, he before the world, is bound to shew? No cause, can he discover of contrition, For that Idolatrie, and Superstition, Which daily multiplyed in these Lands By his connivance, or by his commands? And, by the vaine hopes, fear, or fraud of those Whose piety consists in mimick showes? And, since there is a Statute, in this Isle Which treasonable makes, to reconcile This people unto Rome; did it appeare No fault, to tolerate an Agent here, Or Nuntio from the Pope, to innovate In matters of Religion, and the State? Is there not cause enough he should repent (Though no cause else were found) that, he hath spent So many years before he doth begin That penitence, which brings forgivenesse in? That he adventured so many falls, Neglected and with-stood so many calls? Made outward shewes, of sorrow and remorse, Yet, was no whit the better, if not worse? That, in his heart, he still prepares for Warre, When all his words for peace, and Treaties are? That GODS long suffrings, and th'indulgencies Of his wrong'd people, he doth still despise? And, that, although he now is in a chaine, His former hopes, and purposes remaine? If he repent not, may he not at last, Be made repent it, when the time is past? That, he is so unwise, as to provoke Those men so far, by whom his pow'r is broke, As by apparent signes, to let them see His aimes to compasse their destruction be? And, how, for that intent still meanes are tri'd, All parties, from each other to divide, And from themselves? Moreover, may he not Find reason to repent, what, by the Scot He hath endeavour'd to effect his ends? What by the Citie, Armie, and his Friends In either House? yea by the people too, That, he may make all Parties help undo Themselves, and him, whose fall till he repent, No pow'r, will be so powerfull to prevent. For, though they thriv'd a while, both he, and they Whom he corrupteth, shall descend one way; And, GOD this Kingdome shall in order set, By men and meanes, not thought upon, as yet. More might be said; much more, to let him see What causes, of repentance there may be; Which I had rather he himselfe should find, (And, seriously consider in his mind) Then hear them from another; and, but that The Common Voice, these faults enumerate, I, had not mention'd them: nor, shall these prove A blemish to him, if all this may move His heart to penitence: For, then Ile say Enough, to take all guiltinesse away; And make him cleaner, then he was that morn, In which it was first said, that he was borne. And, GOD, so blesse my hopes, as I intend All this, to bring his troubles to an end; And in this manner do it, that past evills, Nor future sinnes, nor spight of men, or Devills, May power obtaine, to stop him, or to fling him From that estate, whereto, I wish to bring him. The way, by me designed (I confesse) To be a path, full of uneasinesse To flesh and blood; and, not without much terror, At first to those, who liv'd in waies of error. It is not so with violets bestrow'd, With pinks and roses, as the path way show'd By his deluding Prelates; but, I'le say, This, confidently, 'tis the safest way, And easiest I could find, for one who had Such long and obstinate by-wand'rings made; And, I unwilling am, he should begin A course, which he might lose his labour in; As those do, who close up a fest'ring wound With healing salves, while filth in them is found. My course may harsh appeare, and full of dangers, To them, who to such practises are strangers; Yet, I dare warrantize, (for I can tell) It leads to heaven, although it lies by hell: And that it will at last be well approved, Of those, who him for his own sake have loved. But, lest, the Maximes, which Court-breeding gives To Kings, and zeale to their Prerogatives, May steel his conscience; and, still, make him dream That, all his Kingdomes, and all things in them, Are his by right: And, that, if it be so, All those endeavourings conducing to The keeping of that Right, may, then be done: And, lest he thence infer, he wrongeth none, On whom, he maketh war, with an intent, Incroachments on his Kingship, to prevent; But, that, they rather, who have him with-stood, Have down upon their own heads, drawn their blood. To take the frothie vanity of that Conceit away; thus, I expostulate: If Kings have such a right; how was it gained? From whom, was that Prerogative obtained? For, sure, what ever Parasites may please To feigne; Kings are not Ab Origines, But had beginnings, like to other men, Who rise, and fall; are born and, and die agen; And, came to their preferments, either by GODS gift, or mans, or else by Victory. 'Twere blasphemy, to say, that God bestow'd That pow'r upon them, which to be allow'd They now contend: and, they from hell did fetch Their Text, or comment, who such Doctrine preach. It cannot be, that God, who, is Perfection; Goodnesse it self; the Essence of Affection; And, Fountaine, out of which free mercy goes, Throughout the whole creation, and o're-flowes: It cannot be, that from among those creatures, (Which are in all things, of the selfe-same natures) He should not only, one or two, advance Above the rest, but by his Odinance Declare it, likewise, to be right and just, In them (even meerly to fulfill their lust) To take from others, when it pleases them, Child, honour, goods, life, liberty and limb; Or, practise cruelties upon them: No, It neither can be, neither is it so: For, in his Word he tells, what Kings should do; There makes description of such Tyrants too, As those, for which their suit his People made; When, in his wrath, a King bestow'd he had; Because, they long'd for that vaine Gallantry, Which they among the Nations, did espie. He sharply threatens Kings, who tyrannize, Or, use their pow'r, in an insulting wise; And sayes, he gave them their Prerogatives, That, men should under them, lead quiet lives; That Swords they have, to execute the Law; Defend the just; ungodly men to awe; And, so to raigne, that no good man might feare The port they carry, or the Sword they beare. Whence then obtain'd they that exorbitant Dominion, whereof, now so much they vaunt? Did first the people, give them such a pow'r And, set them up, of purpose to devour, Vex, and inslave them? That were to conceive A madnesse, which no wise men will beleeve; Nor many fools, their folly so betray, As thus to think; much lesse, the same to say, And, doubtlesse hitherto, no Nation had So little reason, as to grow so mad. Did they then raise themselves, unto their height? Where got they pow'r, to conquer such a right? If others helpt them, whither did they run, To keep themselves free, when that deed was done? It seemeth likely, they would stay to share, Their portions, where they so victorious were; And did not sure, intend to set up one, By whom, they would themselves be trod upon. Nor, could those valiant men become so base, To leave behind them, an inslaved race, By takeing such conditions, as are now, Impos'd on many Kingdomes, which you know. Or, if a Nation, might be fool'd so much, Who knowes, this Peoples lot, to have been such? What antient History, or what record Thereof, a testimoniall doth afford? If none, how do your British Tyrants claime What they usurp; and that whereat they aime? If they obtain'd it by deceiving trust, Which is most true (then, make amends they must) And if spontaneously they do the same, They lose with honour, what they got with blame. If they prescription plead, from times of yore; Time makes not wrongs, to be the lesse, but more. By Conquest, will they claime it; know ye, then, The Conquerours are conquered agen; And, what time, and the sword away have tore, Time, and the sword, doth righteously restore: And, that, time is no bar to rightfull things; Is for the people, true, as well as Kings; But how, their Peoples freedomes, goods and lives Shall Kings protect, if their Prerogatives, Should be infring'd, or lost? there is indeed A just Prerogative, that he may need In some Immergencies, which both by reason, And, by the law of nature is in season, When things which for the Publike safety are, Require them; and, when no knowne lawes declare What may be done. In such necessities No Common-Wealth, no prudent man, denies An Arbitrary Pow'r to private men; Much lesse, to Magistrates, and Princes, then. No Nation is so foolish to restrain That just Prerogative, and so make vaine Their owne security: they will and may Be Judge of those nccessities; for they Are most concerned in them; and if he Whom they to guard them chose, depriv'd shall be Of meanes to do his duty; they must bear The blame of what ensues: for, he is clear. Thus, I could answer to all other things, Which are objected by usurping Kings, If need requir'd; and bring them light to see, How they by hypocrites, abused be; And, say enough, were he thereto inclin'd, To make your present King, to change his mind. But, GOD, that only turnes the hearts of Kings, And to himself reserves such glorious things, As their conversions; will I hope, in time, Produce that miracle of grace in him: For, if I guesse right, he would now be glad To know, where wholesome counsell might be had; And knowes what 'tis, to want, in his distresse, Such men as dare the truth to him professe, Without regarding carnall hopes, or feare; Or, who displeased, or well pleased are. There are some Prayers left upon record, That, plead yet, strongly for him, to the Lord, And, which, by his forgot Remembrancer, Were offered up for him in his first year, When that, which now is truly come to passe, By him foreseen, and justly feared was. It may be, at this present time, those Praiers Then sent up, for this King, and his affaires, Begin to take effect; for, who doth know What mercies from the Fount of Grace may flow? Or, what for him, those offerings might prepare Which made, by Faith, in Fiery Trialls were? Oh, if they take effect, and if he find, Such motions (as are wish'd for) in his mind, To spring up; let a blessed deaw from heaven, Descend, that growth unto them, may be given. With true humility, let him begin, To meet them kindly, and to welcome in Those guests with such respect into his heart, As may there fix them, never to depart. Let not a shame, to be repented of, Or, their derisions, who perhaps will scoffe At such a change, deter from persevering; Or, by their threats, beget in him a fearing Of what may follow: for, it glad shall make, And cheere his Soul, when all their hearts will ake. Let him not entertain the least suspect His Penitence will want a due effect, If it be true; or, that a guard or wall, From being manifest, restraine it shall, When once it workes: Nor let his people feare To trust him, when he proves therein sincere: For, hearty Penitence, is of a straine Not like to that, which hypocrites do faine; But, moving, unresistable, and cleare, When, and in whomsoere, it shall eppeare. Yea, thereunto, so great a pow'r is given, That, hearts, alone, it breaks not ope, but heav'n, And, maketh way to reconcile agen, The greatest sinners, both to GOD and Men. For, whosoere is truly penitent, Meerly with tongue and eies, doth not repent, With vowes, with protestations, and with tears; Or, with such formall complements, as theirs Who keep an out-side-fast, or cloath the back With vestments, and with long cloakes, died black; Or, who make faces, or look for a while, So sad, as if it were a mortall sinne, to smile: But, wheresoere true penitence you see, Like rising up from death to life will bee. It wholly changes, and new moulds, new makes That man, within whose heart, it rooting takes. As well within, it cleanseth as without: And, that the truth of it, ye may not doubt, The sinner from ill habits, it estranges; His words, his thoughts, his company it changes: His works, his waies, his plots, and his designes; Of good intentions, giveth certaine signes, He daily growes more fruitfull, takes more care, To be indeed reform'd, then to appeare: Regards not, what of others, he is thought, So, he, unto perfection, may be brought; Fears nothing more, shuns nothing more then sin, And, that abhorred course which he was in. Forgiveth every one, that was his foe; Gives unto all men, that which he doth owe; Shames, neither to bewaile, or to confesse To GOD or men, his former wickednesse; Nor any good advice, will disesteem, How mean soere the counsellor shall seem: And, when the King, thus changed shall returne, Who, would desire his coming to adjourne? When thus a true repentance doth improve him, VVho would then, forgive, and trust, and love him? For, when you find a metamorphosis, In him, so supernaturall as this, Nought formerly by him, mis-said, mis-done, Or, misconceived, shall be thought upon To future disadvantage, though the sin Hath black, or, of a scarlet tincture bin. Though by an over-good conceit of him, Who stood suspected, he restrained them, Who sought to bring his fathers death to triall, And, gave offence, by giving a deniall To Justice, in that cause, to take her course; And, rais'd suspitions, too, of somewhat worse: Yea, though he were a sinner, twice as bad As he (by those, who love him least) is made; And, had, beside the blood his Party spilt, More sin upon him, then the double guilt Of King Manasseh; he, as pure should grow By such repentance, as the Mountain snow. And, when to this repentance he is brought, Who can object? or, how can it be thought, That, in fulfilling of the covenant (As touching him) you shall one title want, Of that Branch, which, expresseth your intent To bring delinquents to due punishment? For, if you can conceive, what 'tis to bring The lofty heart, and spirit of a King, To stoop so much, as to descend unto What, he that's truly penitent must do; Or, if you could believe what self-denialls, What inward torments, and what fiery trialls Are undergone, and must be passed through By those, who truly penitentiall grow, You would confesse, that, nor restraint, nor chaines, Nor death it selfe, had in them feares or paines, So terrible, so full of grief and smart, As those, which exercise a contrite heart; And, you would say (when forth this fruit he brings) No sinners; no such Penitents as Kings. Oh what a blessed, what a glorious thing It were Great Britan, to behold thy King Come back thus chang'd, and with a mind to do, That, which thy Genius hath advis'd him to! And, that, which his owne conscience cannot chuse But tell him, it were madnesse, to refuse! How, would his drooping Subjects, then rejoyce, To bid him welcome, both with heart and voice! How would his friends, triumph, how would his foes, Their aimes, and wicked expectations lose? How would those hypocrites among you tremble, Who did with him and all the world dissemble! How, would their soules be comforted, who were To him, and to the Common good sincere! And by both sides oppressed, for abiding In their first principles; and, for not siding With this, or, with that faction, to make strong, Themselves and other men, in doing wrong! What hopes thereby would other Nations take, That his example would some changes make In their oppressors? How, would they be struck With terrors, who have Tyranny mistook For Kingship; and, by strained Monarchie Themselves infected with Lycanthropie! How, would your noisome Grashoppers, and Flies, Frogs, Lice, and Caterpillers, which arise From their corruptions (fearing to delay, Their lingring here) hop, fly, and crawl away! How, would the BEAST then rage; the Scarlet Whore, Then, curse and raile; the Devills howle and roare; As fearing, they their heights were falling from, And, that the Kingdome, which they hate, were come! But, his conversion, would not long adjourne Their miseries, to whom he should returne, Unlesse they take more care, and, more delight To make their conversations more upright, Then heretofore; unlesse to meet him too, They better shall prepare, then yet they do; Unlesse they more unite; more wise appeare, In resolutions; and then, more adhere To that which is resolv'd; unlesse more jealous They grow of Publike honour, and more zealous Of Publike Faith; more clear in their intent; More diligent, more studious to prevent Supplanting wiles, more sensible of wrong, Sustain'd by them, who to their side belong, More carefull, that their Friends may firm abide; And, that all others may be satisfi'd According to just hopes; and plainely see The common-good, their chiefest aim to bee. For, sure, the Kings repentance will availe But little to their comfort, who shall faile In such like duties; or in meeting him With such affections, as he brings to them. But, when all other sinners grace receive, They shall with Hypocrites, their portion have; And, to their shame great vexation, then, See those, whom they thought worst, the better men. The British Genius, as, if he had in Some secret Musing, or Devotion been, Here made a pause; and, therefore, here will we Take breath, a little, if you pleased be. The Contents of the second Lection. The Genius, here, declares to them Who exercise the Power-supreme; How, they, much mischiefe might prevent: How, they, the people may content: How, keep their Pow'r, aad Cause upright, With honour, in their Foes despight; And tenders, that, this may be done, Much to be duly thought upon. Tells, what the people ought to do, To give assistance, thereunto; Perswades, the Nations to agree, Lest by themselves, they ruin'd be; The Factious-parties doth advise, To lay aside their vanities; And, interweaveth, here and there, What, others may with profit heare. Shewes LONDON, where her weal doth lie; Speaks reason, to the Souldierie; Minds, to what sort of Irish, you Some share of mercy, should allow: To Preachers, preacheth waies of peace, To further Truth with Righteousnesse: Then drawing toward his conclusion, Presageth Order, from confusion: Informeth, from what Pedigree Good Government deriv'd will bee; And, when that's told you, ye shall heare What's whisper'd in the Authours eare. The GENIUS, (whom observe I pray, with heed) With raised eyes, did thus againe, proceed: How faine would I find words and exhortations, Whichmight, not now, be lost upon these Nations? But, cause them to consider, and discerne Those things, which their well-being may concerne? That, all well meant endeavours for their good, Might not be still neglected, or withstood; And, future ages, wonder, what dire Fate, This Generation did infatuate? My breath, hath hitherto, been chiefly spent, The Kings approaching ruine to prevent: By skrewing thoughts into him which may wake him From slumber; and, for peace, industrious make him. Now I will also, somewhat, say to them, Who stand, in prime relation, unto him; That, if his heart GOD change not, neither he May them destroy, nor they destructive be Unto themselves. And, what, to that good end, I shall advise, is this: Dear friends, attend. Let those high Courts, by whom the Pow'r-supreme, Is exercised in the name of him Who now is laid aside; let those adventer No longer, to wheele round, without a Center: But, fix on somewhat, whereon to be steddie, Before all catch the Staggers, and grow giddie. Let that be rectifi'd, which now, disturbs Their nat'rall motions, in their sev'rall Orbs; Lest if the Nations clash, they thereby crack The wheeles of Government, and make them break Against each other, when there will be here, To mend them, no well-skill'd State-Ingineere. Reduce your wand'ring lights; let ev'ry star Within your Firmament keep his owne sphere; Lest, if above their Circles they aspire, Like Phaeton, they set the world on fire; Or aid those Comets, which already glare Prodigiously, to breed combustions here, Whose mischeivous effects, you may in vaine Attempt, perhaps, hereafter, to restraine. Till to the snuffe they blaze; or, till they shall To quench their thirstings, all your blood exhale. This mischeife to prevent, let ev'ry wit, And ev'ry Pow'r subordinate, submit To that, which is supreme; ev'n unto that, Which for the present, is predominate, For publike-safety: And let that abide On Principles, which neither may divide Or, wound it selfe; lest on it selfe, it draw Contempt, from them, who, thereof stood in awe; And, that contempt so weaken them at length, That they, with losse of honour, lose their strength: For, yon have felt, (as well as heard it told) What of Divisions, hath been said of old. Your present postures give occasion may To some, of doubting, whom they should obey; How far forth, their obedience must extend; How long they shall uncertainly attend, The hatching of that Government, which must Continue fixt; and, whereto they may trust. Which questionings, and doubtings (though good reason Hath made them in these Islands, now, in season) Enfeeble much your Pow'r; and do beget, (Though seemingly the people do submit) Ill consequences, which will still be worse, Untill you settle on some certaine course: Especially, if they suspect that pow'r, Intendeth not their benefit, but your. Delay not, therefore, that which they expect: And, till a settlement may take effect, (Or, till they better know, what doth pertaine To your new curb, and also to your reine) With kindnesse mannage them, and condescend To what, may for their satisfaction tend In all just seeming Rights; till they may see, That, by your pow'r, their peace preserv'd shall bee. And then, if your Authority to own, They shall refuse; so make your courage known, That, none may dare blaspheme, or scandalize Those needful Pow'rs, and lawful Dignities, Which are above their Censures; least you farther Their Plots, who have no hope, but in disorder; Since, better it becomes, Wisemen to dye In Order, then, to live in Mutiny. Mark, those among you, who, whilst they pretend Your Power, and your Proceedings, to befriend, Impair them, underhand, by driving on Designs, destructive to what should be done. So many Marks, upon them do appear, Declaring to what Party they adhere, That, well they may be known: And, they to whom These are discover'd, find what will become Of You, and your Affaires, unless, you shall With speed (and wisely) them, in question call. Your greatest Foes, &amp;, they who most may wrong you, Are some, who, daily Counsel take among you; Your Adversaries, as the Prophet said, Are men of your own Houses, who have plaid The parts of seeming Friends. Of these, therefore, Take heed, and seek to cast them out of doore Before they cast you out: Whirh, were they stronger, Deferred would not be one minute longer. When you have purg'd your House (until which day All will be spoke in vain, that I shall say) Take my advice (for it is genuine, And, that, whereto your Genius doth incline) First, to Debate, and, then, to Question, bring The Government, and what concerns the King; Which, being prudently resolv'd upon, Will save you twenty labours, in that One: And, make, (if you perform, as is profest) An easie passing thorough all the rest. In your Debates, discover not that spleen Or Virulency, wherein, may be seen, A purpose, nor to give, nor take content; But, so contest, that, when ye shall assent, There may, on you, be seen the fewer scars Of your unhappy and uncivil Wars; And, that it may appeare, your strife hath bin, Not, that your Will, but, that the Truth may win. Yet, lest, whilst you are forced to contest, You may destroy the noblest Interest By dull Indifferency, or want of zeal; Look to the safety of the Common-weal, As to your chiefe Allegiance: For, a King Who makes a claim, although the claimed thing, Be due, yet, if he so exacteth it, As, that, it publike danger may beget, Becomes a Traytor to the Royall Trust, In him repos'd; and, merits to be thrust Besides the Throne, if, therein, he persist, To prosecute his private Interest. When, ye are certain, what should be prefer'd, From prosecuting it, be not deter'd; Or, from a stout ingagement, in that Cause, Whereto, you are obliged by the Laws Of GOD, and Nature: For, a work begun With Courage, is as good, as half way done. Let not the foolish feares, or superstition Of earebor'd slaves (the Foot-stools of Ambition) Who Idolize, and deifie their Kings, As more then mortal, and unbounded things; Let not these fright: But, well examine you What, to the People; what, to them, is due, That, so, your Friends, who see your prudency, May be preserved from Apostacy. Consider, wisely, how with him, you deale, Who, of these Vessels, was esteem'd, erewhile, Both Master, and Chief owner; that, nor he Nor you, may ruin'd, or dishonour'd be, By any practise, which may not befit Your Wisdom, or your Justice, to permit, Force not each other into such a Streight, As, that, there may from thence, be no retreit; Or, means left, for th'one Party to prevent The others fall, although he should repent. But, as, indeed, you hitherto have done, Him, as the Publike Father look upon. And, though his Parasites, have him inrag'd By causless Jealousies, and far ingag'd Against your Lives, and Freedomes; yet, assay To shew him, all the Mercy, that you may. Ulysses did spontaneously assent To be inchanted, that, he might prevent The Syrens Charms; and, you, without just blame Have done, (and may, yet do to him) the same Who hath already, been by their inchanting So charm'd, that, very little now is wanting Of his, and your destruction. By his own, And others faults, distemper'd he was grown; And thereby hath indangered, no less His own Safe-being, then the Common-Peace; And, while destructive Courses he shall take, You, are oblig'd to stop, and pull him back; Though, his Seducers, grow inrag'd thereby, And, terme you Traytors, for your loyalty. Yea, you may still restraine him, and thereto Add more, if need require it should be so; Till GOD, by his especial grace, hath brought him, To shun the Course, which, evil Counsel taught him; Or, left him so, that, wilfully he shall Without your fault, by his own Projects, fall. I will not counsel, that, ought lesse you do Then Salus Populi constraines you to; For, though the Sheepish Rout, more think upon Things present, then on what is past and gone; And, seem to have alreadie, so forgot Late grievances, as if they thought it not So great a plague, to be inslav'd for aye, As present weights to bear, though but one day: Yea, though the most part, of the Common rabble, So sottish are, and so irrationable, That, out of fear, lest others should enslave them, They would inslave themselves, &amp; those that save them: Yet, must not those, on whom the Land relies, Benummed grow with such stupidities: For, 'tis a Symptome of a Sottish Nation, To grow respectless of self-preservation; Or, fear to practise, what agrees with reason, Because it hath been falsly called Treason, By Parasites, and Priests; who, that a King Might make them something, made him any thing, Which he desir'd to be; and, hence did rise Abhominable Court-Idolatries. Yea, hence it was, that men first grew afraid To think (untill of late) what may be said, And must be relolutely done, before GOD, will, these Isles, to their lost Peace restore. A Realm, that fears to call her Trustee, to Accompt, for ought mis-done, or left to do; Is like those Children, who do fear the shows, Which they themselves set up to scare the Crows: And, they, who think you have no rightfull power To curb his furie, who, might you devour; May think, as well, they should not put a clog, Or hang a chain, upon a Shepherds dog, Although, he daily bites, and kills the sheep, Which he was, only, bred, and fed, to keep. In warlike manner, with his Standard rear'd, The King, against you, in the Field appear'd; And, gave you (as it were) a Summons thither, That, he, and you, might plead your Rights together, By way of Combate; which your Common-Laws Allow of, for the triall of that Cause, Whereof there's doubtfull proof; And, wherein none Knows how to judge aright, but, GOD, alone. This Tryal, both did stand to: By this Tryal, The King, was overcome, without denial; And did submit. What, had you then to do? But, what you would your selves, be done unto, When your Desires, were made a Rule, whereby Another, might, Square out his Charity? Men, do not use to hunt a Beast of prey, To take him, and, then, let him go away. They, who have caught a Lyon, you would blame If they dis-mist him (though he seemed tame) Unchain'd, and without keepers; since, that Creature Is known, of so untamable a Nature, That he will ravine, as he did before, If, to himself, you leave him anie more. Kings, who without controul, the Scepter swaid, As tamelesse are, as Lyons that have preyd: Which, howsoever, you shall use, or feed them, Will soon grow dangerous, unlesse you heed them; You, therefore, must not give them leave to seize, On ought, at will; no, not so much as Fleas, Lest, some Prerogative, they thereon found: But, you must circle them within a Bound; And, Laws, and Counsellors provide, whereby You may their Wills, and Judgements, rectifie: And, then, when they by generall consents, So furnish'd be, they may be Instruments Of Honor, Peace, and Plenty. And, take this From me, who know best, what, most fitting is For this Isles constitution; That th'increase Of Wealth, and Honor; Settlement of Peace, And Freedom from Oppressions, (whatsoe're Some dream) shall never be enjoyed here, In any Government, so perfectly, As, by a regulated Monarchy. Shall I advise you to a Treaty, than? No: Tis not now, as when the War began. Before the Tryall, your Trustees, did well To treat for Peace; because, they could not tell What might succeed; and, thought it safer, far, To take some wrong, then seek redresse by War. But, now, for them to Treat, were to admit That, GOD, had past no Tryall for them, yet. And, those, who thereto would perswade them, now, I shall not for their wisest Friends allow, If friends: For that, not only of their prizes Defeats the Conquerors, but, equalizes Them, likewise with the Conquer'd; and makes void, What, should by right of Conquest, be injoyd. When he whose ancient Birth-right was quite lost, Hath by expence of labour, time, and cost, A lawfull repossession of it sought, And, at the Law, his suit to Tryall brought; Obtained a Verdict, Judgement, Execution, And, full possession without Diminution: What, for a Friend, I pray were such a one? Who should perswade this man, when all were done, To wave his lawfull right, so dearly bought, To treat with him, who his undoing sought? And, uncompel'd, refer unto debate, What, he should leave, or take, of that Estate? And, what were that man but, a Groll, at best, Who, re-adventur'd, thus, his Interest? Nor honester, nor wiser, much, are they Who, now, into a Treaty would betray The Parliament. For what hath it been done, If they must Treat, again, for what is won? Why, did they make good meaning men to fight And lose their lives, to win for them, a Right, Which they must get by Treaty? Why, is he A Prisoner, if a King as yet, he be That's capable of Treating? Or, of more Then you shall seem obliged to restore, In meer humanity? Or, by that band, Whereby, as Christians, you obliged stand, Upon his true Repentance? And, upon Security, like fault, shall not be done? But if no Treaty be allow'd, how then Shall you, and he, be reconcil'd agen? By such a Course, as will be generous; And, for our Genius to advise; Ev'n thus: Like honorable Victors, offer him Terms honorable, if he merit them, By true Repentance (For, it will be more Then can be justly offer'd him before) Lest, you, at last, may be requited ill, If Power, he get, before he change his Will. When, you perceive, that, GOD in him hath wrought That mind, whereto you wish he should be brought, Give him Conditions, freely, such as may Full well become a King, whom, to obey, Acknowledg, and submit to, 'twill beseem Those Nations, who, a good repute esteem. Give him, that Kingly-Liberty, which will Confine him, from all power of doing ill; And, him enable, too, for every thing, Pertaining to the Office of a King: Which, to declare; and, to consider how It shall secured be, I, leave to you; Whom they concern, and, who know how, to make Your own Conditions, if, good heed you take. But many are suppos'd to be inclin'd To some new Government, by them design'd In whose erection, and establishment, They could receive a great deal more content Then in well regulating, what they had: And, some of these, it may be, are so mad, (And so incharitable) as, in heart To pray, that GOD would rather, quite, depart Both from this King, and all his Generation, Then, frustrate them of their vain Expectation. If, there be any such, far, be you from Their evill mind; Let not their secret come Into your Souls: And though GOD should permit His wilfullnesse, a little longer, yet; Pronounce your Judgements, warily, on him, Lest, in his Person, you, your selves condemn. And, since, 'tis possible, that, from your sin, His Failings, and your Plagues, might first begin, (As, once did, from the Peoples, an offence In David, which brought on a pestilence) Consider, 'twill make easie your own Doom, If, toward him, affected you become, As Children ought to be, whose Father hath Attempted their destruction, in his wrath. Yea, carefull be, you do not so imploy Yeur pow'r, to cure the Head, that, you destroy Both Head and Body; and, to ease the pains Of Head-ache, that, you knock not out your Brains. That, Limb, which may be cur'd, cut not away: Those Vessells, which with water, clense ye may Purge not with Fire; For, GOD, shall give an end By his own Pow'r, to what, you cannot mend; And, neither he, nor you, shall rise to stand, But, by advancing Justice, in the Land. Excuse me, if ('twixt what concernes the King, And these Republikes) with some staggering, I seem to Counsell you; One while perswading, That, you oppose with stoutnesse, his invading Your Freedoms, and Proprieties; Then, streight Plead (as it were) that, Grace obtain he might; Herein, I say, excuse me: For, it fares With me, as with King David, in his Wars, With Absolom; Against whom, to prevail, He was content; yet did his death bewail. Loth was he, by a Foe, to be out-braved; Griev'd was he, that, a Son might not be saved; And, him, who he had sent to overthrow him, He did beseech, that, Mercy, he would show him. The same I do for him: Oh, let him have it If he be qualified to receive it: But, if he still persist, as he begun, Then, do, as GOD shall move you; I, have done. Done, as concerning him: But, much I find, Concerning, you, and others, yet, behind; Which must be spoken, for the Reformation, And, Welfare, of this present Generation; Or, else, (if otherwise it shall succeed) That Future-Ages may take better heed. For, know, unlesse ye speedily begin To change the present Posture, you are in; That, you, who, at this day have Pow'r to give Conditions, to your King; shall, to receive Conditions, verie glad, ere long become: Yea, and to buy them, also, with a sum. That, this may be prevented, break the snare, Wherewith, at this time, you ensnarled are. When, you have anie thing to act, which may Encrease the Publike suffrance, by delay; Consume not precious howrs, like those who dally, In their Affairs, with Can we? May we? Shall we? Till they, whom you obliged are to cherish: Through want of Justice, and Subsistence, perish. Or, else, till they, who, yet, are knit together, So fall away, from you, and from each other; That, what you might effect, this present day, Hereafter, you nor can, nor shall, nor may. For, think not, that, the Generalitie, Can long continue in prosperitie, Whilst, you neglect particulars: Or, that You can accomplish, what is aimed at, If you, leave off, to act by rules of Reason, Or, linger out, your works beyond their season. Take, likewise, heed, that, when ye shall propose The way of Peace, lest, there may be of those, Amongst you, who, desire, that course should find, Obstructions, whereunto, they seem inclin'd, Or, who, for secret ends, occasions give, That, their demands, deniall may receive; For, GOD, so hateth double heartednesse, That, he will favour no such practises. Then, he as needfull, if you shall exceed Set-bounds, by some inevitable need, Compelling it; that, when the streight is past, Your selves into a Legall course, you cast: For, while a Town is burning, that, you see May, then, be done; which, after, may not be. Do, as you would be done to: Give not those Who are your Friends, occasion to be Foes: As you would be forgiven, those forgive, In whom, a true Repentance you perceive: Not all Offenders; for, sure, no offence Is pardonable without penitence, Since, Mercie deigned to Impenitents Is crueltie, to wronged Innocents. Reward, as well as punish: For, by that You cherish Virtue; Fortifie the State, And, shall gain more, then by the pence you spare, Though, many, of this Thrift, unheedfull are. Against all Enemies, make your defence By prudence, joyn'd with Dove-like Innocence, Keep firm to your first principles; For, he That standeth fixt; though weak he seems to be Gets strength; and will by standing still, out-go That man, who alwaies wanders to, and fro. Be constant then; Affect vain hopes no more: Do Justice, and shew mercy to the poor. Respect not Persons; but, judge every cause According to right Conscience, and the Laws; Remembring GOD, all men, to judgement brings, Whether they sit with Commoners, or Kings. Know, he marks all mens walkings; and, beleeve Such measure, as ye mete, ye shall receive; So, as ye answer, poor mens prayers, now, So, GOD shall answer, and so prosper you. Make good, the Gifts and Favours you bestow; As well, in deed, be righteous, as in show: Break not, your promises to any one (Especially, to men, for you undone) And, do not let your left-hand, them deprive, Of that, which, with your right-hand, you did give: Nor them repay with scandals, and neglect Who have deserved, not your least respect: For, privie to such practises, I am Both, to the grief of many, and your shame. When, any one of those free Commoners, Whom you do represent, traduc'd appears, Within your Houses, where, he cannot make Reply thereto: (And, whereof he must take No notice, when thereof he shall be told) Let his Traducers sharply be controld. Or, calld upon, to prove what they have said: That, Innocencie may not be betrayd, By Impudent Detractors; yea, and do That, wrong, as priviledged thereunto. For, what is more Injurious, then disgrace Inflicted, in so eminent a place? In presence of the Kingdom, as it were, And, whereby, ere a man can be beware, He may be wrong'd, and wounded mortally, And, never know, by whom, or how, or why. Let none aspire, to be a Grandee, thought, Till he his Greatnesse, worthily hath bought By prudent Honestie; Tri'd Faithfullnesse, And such like Grandeur, nay, let none possesse Repute by these, one minute longer then, The Publike Rights, and those of private-men, Are, thereby, not infring'd: For 'tis a wrong To all men, unto whom there doth belong Equality, to bring in such a Cheat Among you, as a Lesser, and a Great, Or, make Estates, or Titles passe for more Then Cyphers do, within the Counsel-dore. And, doubtlesse, he unworthily, there, sits Whom, false opinion of his Fellows wits Inslaves in Judgement: and, whose Ignorance Deceived by a smooth-tongu'd Arrogance, Them, doth advance, to an undue esteem; And (which the more absurd doth make it seem) Superiority, ascribes unto them For that, in which, at home, their wives out-do them. It is a shame, to hear it should be said, (Yet, said it is, and done, as well as said) That if this man, or that; If He, or He, To make the Motion, can procured be; Or, in the Cause, to speak: Or, but to heed The same with favour, it will surely speed: And, that, if it concerns, or may displease But, any one, that is a Friend to these Great Hogen Mogens; then the Suitor loses His cost, and labour, what means e're he uses. Yea, though he hath two hundred friends, among Your Members, who, cry shame upon the wrong. Nay, be not angry that I tell you so, For, he that speaks it, speaks what he doth know, 'Tis I, (this Islands Genius who doth see, What all your works, and inclinations be) Who saith it: And, for him, your Conscience too, Shall witnesse, true, what he hath said you do. And, I beseech you, to consider, whether This, were the end of calling you together. The Shiers, and Burrough, by whom they were chose For Deputies did verily suppose, By their great words at home, their cloaths, and faces, That, these, much better, would have fill'd their places; And, not have proved such, of whom, they may (As you abusively of Taylors say) Aver, that nine of them, makes but One man: For, twice so manie, hardly, make way can By one Grandee, somtimes, and not be thrust From executing, faithfully, his trust: And, therefore, you must speedilie provide That this abuse, be fully rectifi'd. I know, there be among you, those, who burn With zeal to Justice; and who trulie mourn, For those who suffer, (and, that GOD wil keep These safe; and make them sing, when others weep) I know, with what compassion, they pass by Their daily Suitors, who upon them cry: And with what yerning bowels, they bewail, That they for due relief, cannot prevail: I know, with what vexations they are pained, When Publike Prayers cannot be obtained: I know their Love, their Patience, and their care, With what great strivings, exerciz'd they are: What diligence they practise, in their Calling, To keep the House, which they are in, from falling, Whilst, manie seeming-Labourers among them, By false-work, or by undermining, wrong them, And, GOD, I know, will them reward at last Though for a while, a bitter cup they taste. But, there are others, slyly shuffled in Among you, who both shame and grief have been To you, and to your friends: Therefore, lest these By sitting neer you, bring you that disease Which hath polluted them; And, lest thereby They bring, not only, lasting infamy Upon this Parliament, but likewise break it; And, by that Rupture, an occasion make it Of Ruine (without hope of Reparation) To all, the rights and Freedomes of this Nation: And, that, if these things happen, you that are Excusable, the better may prepare, Against the Mischiefs threatned; I am bold To tell you, what misdoings I behold, What dangers I may fear, what scandals grow, By former failings; and, what wise men know Will follow: whereof since, it is but need, That more be said, wherewith, I thus proceed. With grief, I speak it, (and, I speak the same Not to asperse, but to prevent the blame And mischief, that may follow) you, have lost Your power, your honour, and your selves almost; And (though, undoubtedly, you do perceive it) Proceed, as if you meant not to believe it; Or, were asleep: But, I intend to wake you; Or, speak those words, which will to peeces shake you. Oh hear, hear, hear! and, let not wholsome words Be spent in vain: Nay, let not fire and Swords, Dearth, Pestilence, and Blood, speak, every day, In dreadfull Dialects, that rouze they may Your sleepie Spirits; yet, seem, still, unheard, Or passed over, without due regard, Till, you be trod to dirt, in your own Gore; Or, in the Grave, where you can hear no more. For Love, for Shame, for Fear; for some respect, Awake, in time, out of your dull neglect Of Publike-Safety; and, from dreaming on, In private projects, till you are undone. Hark! how, the Beames of your own Houses cry Against you! hark! hark! how the souls that lye In those Oppressions, which you should redresse, Roare out, and groan for sorrow, in distresse; Hark! how your Consciences (though, you contemn, Their clamours, and in secret smother them) Call out, to tell you, what sad dooms attend Your present being, or your latter end, If you awake not, quickly, to prevent The shames and mischiefs which are imminent. Now, I perceive you are awake: for, Lo, You angry seem, that I have rub'd you so. But, ere you shew your wrath, a little, pause; About you look: see, if there be not cause Of this my seeming boldness. Come, arise, Wipe out the Rheume, and spedom, from your eyes. Walk forth into the Hall at Westminster; Take special notice, what, is talked there. Walk to the City, then, and those you meet At Church, or on the Change, or in the Street, Or at the Taverne, and in all those places, Mark well; and, what is said to your disgraces. Mark, how they sleight you, and, how few there are Who, can with patience, either speak or heare A word in your defence: And, having weigh'd What you shall find, excuse, what I have said. Whence, do their many Imprecations come, And many Cursed Speakings? Flow, they from No cause at all? No question, if they do, Their Curses, and their Imprecations, too, Will fall upon themselves. If, from just cause They do proceed; Look, lest, it vengeance drawes. For, GOD, will judg between you. If, both give Occasion of offence, both shall receive The recompence deserv'd; and, you, and they, If you repent not, shall be swept away. To Error, therefore, do not Fury add: With him, that seeks to cure you, be not mad: But, in your selves, examine patiently What is amiss, and, then, what remedy You may apply. And, I will seek to charm The People, that, meane while, they do no harm. Consider, what vast sums have bin brought in; How issu'd out, and wasted, they have bin; How partially, your payments, have been made; How little, this man; how much, that man had; How, you to some, make full, and speedie pay, When others, who, deserve as well as they, Must turn Informers, ere they can be paid; And, peradventure, when they long have plaid That hateful part, with loss of time and cost, Shall add more damages, to what they lost, By losing former friends, and getting foes: Which, all their lifetime, they shall never lose. Herewith, somtime, let it be thought upon, How many of your friends have been undone By Votes, and Orders, made for their relief, Which did but more increase their cost and grief, By making them, from year to year, attend, For that, which in one week might have an end; By suffering, your own Warrants, to be slighted: Your own Authority, to be despited; And, to the loss of labour, time, and cost, One Order, by another to be crost, And, that, to be, by Ordinance made voyd, Which, by your Gifts, they seiz'd, possest, enjoy'd: Yea, and, not without recompence alone, But, without seeming sense, that wrong was done: As if it were no matter, so you made A shew of recompence, though none they had: Or, as if whatsoere you pleas'd to do, Must passe for Justice, though it be not so. GODS WILL, essentiall Justice is indeed: But, that yours is so, 'tis not my Creed. When others have transgrest, do not injoyne The guiltlesse Common-wealth, to pay a Fine, To recompence those Parties, which were grieved; For, that will hardly, Justice be believed. When hungry suitors, ask for fish, or bread, With stones, or scorpions, let them not be fed; Nor make them wait, ere you an answer give, As if each Person, had three lives, to live; Or, had been borne, no other thing to do, But, wait on you, and loose their labour too. Draw not more suitors, to you in one yeare; Then you are able, in twice six, to heare; Lest, you displease them, whom ye may content, And cause a mischiefe, which ye might prevent. But take wise Jethro's Counsell, for the ease, Both of our selves, &amp; those whom you should please. Yea, tire not out your selves, and others too, By taking on you more then you can do. Lest, when attendance, much expence and trouble, Hath made the losse, and suffrance more then double, They grow impatient; and you come to tast The fruit of their impatiencie at last. Give Order, how to cure those imperfections, Which have been, heretofore, in your Elections, Lest, Members may among you be emploid, By whom the Publike-Body, be destroid. Let not the Father, there beget the sonne, Though, this in Bodies Naturall, be done: Let none among you, be admitted in, By Marriage, or, being near of kin: Or, (to the Kingdomes just dissatisfaction) For being of this Sect, or of that Faction; As, if among you, some to purchase, meant Inheritances in the Parliament: And, others aim'd by Parties, to endeavour The keeping up Divisions, there, for ever. Let it be so no more, if you can Order, That, such an injurie proceed no further; But, let the Burroughs, and the Shires be free To make their choice, (as they inclin'd shall bee) According to their customes, till it may Be better done, by some new lawfull way: That, when for Trust-breach, any blamed are, Their chusers, in that blame, a part may beare; If they hereafter, for their private ends, For fear, or love, shall chuse their Foes, or Friends; Their Land-Lords, Kinsmen, Lawyers; or, whom ever They shall not think, will faithfully endeavour, To serve his GOD, the People, and the King, With single heart, in ev'ry lawfull thing. Consider, how in giving a reward, The person, more then merit, you regard. How often that hath been for private ends, Procur'd; and, with relation unto friends. How Offices, and Places are bestowne; How, some have two or three; and others, none, Who better merit four, if there were any Who could be capable of halfe so many: And, would ye well observ'd, that this is done, As if ye fear'd, as if ye car'd for none; Nor, how, the people, who upon you cry For bread, observe your partiality, In giving that to one, who hath no need, Which would a thousand Starvelings, cloath and feed. Refuse no just complaints; that, men may see You sensible of their oppressions bee: Yet, to your selves assume not any cause, Which is determinable by the Lawes, In other Courts; unlesse they prove corrupt; Or, till some difficulty interrupt The course of Justice there: And, so provide, To try in course, what is before you tri'd, That you undo not, e're their cause have end, Those, who with Proofes, and Counsell, must attend. The sad Petition, which the poore man brings, Sleight not, nor make them but meere pocketings, Till they are quite worne out, or quite forgot, Unlesse purchance your store supplies you not With tinder for Tobacco; and, so brings To memorie againe, such triviall things. More mind your promises, of doing right To grieved men, when you thereto have might, And, let them see, that your devoiur you do, As far, as God enables you thereto. Consider how you Legacies bestow Before you pay those debts, which yet ye owe; Ev'n debts, for which the Publike Faith doth lie At Pawne; and, is dishonoured thereby: Debts, for which, your poore Creditors have laine In prison, till, their Freedomes to obtaine, They sold their Freeholds, when they had no more To live on; and, had sold their goods before. Debts, which they lent you in your greatest feare; And borrowed for you, when distrest you were. Yea, Debts, which they who lent, then lent you too Their lives, the publike services to do; And, could have lost them, with more joy then they Now live to see, by seeing of this day. How easily, to some do you afford, Beliefe to the ravaile, on their bare word! When, in the selfe-same case you are not moved, To do the like for others, who have proved What they aver'd by vouchers; no, not when It hath been prov'd, by Oathes of honest men. Consider, how, to some you do allow Their dues with interest, who well enough May respite it; and, yet the same deny To him, who felt extreame necessity By loosing part; by lending of the rest; By borrowing more, for you, on interest, Now four years due; and, which before he shall In likelihood, be paid; will eat up all. And, let it be consider'd, if it may, What tis, to take his liberty away, To fine him; to permit that through the land, He for conspiracie, defam'd should stand; And, suffer much more by their impudence Who misinform'd you, of his innocence, And all for nought, but, for informing you What, he was told; what, he beleev'd was true; What, he produc'd his author for, with proofe Of Part, and circumstances too enough, To make all probable; yea, more, for what His Covenant, oblig'd him to relate; And, what his first Relator did aver, And will do, still, in each particular. Should I propose, here, as considerable, So many things, to you as I were able, I should as tedious in the same become, As, many times, Committees, are to some. Ile therefore sum up all, in wishing you Of those things which you know, to make reveiw, And see, if these come short, in any thing, Of those, who heretofore misled the King; Or, if their falshoods, or misinformations, Were greater causes, of his aberrations; Or, more dishonour to his Government; Then, these have been unto this Parliament, Whose Pride, Ambition, Malice, Arrogance, Whose Avarice, Selfe-love, and Ignorance, Whose Insolence, or Cowardice, of late, Have caus'd so manie to abhominate Them, and their courses; and nigh turned all, Ev'n all things both Divine, and Temporall, Into a Chaos. 'Tis not, as is deemed, (And, as perhaps, it hath to many seemed) 'Tis not the City, which hath lately made Those tumults, and those uproars you have had. 'Tis not the Army, whence your mutinies, New plots, and new divisions, do arise; And, whereby, mischiefs daily do encrease To cause a new adjournment of your Peace; The Parl'aments dishonour; separations Between the late united British Nations; And, (if it may be possible) to bring The people of both Kingdomes, and the King, Into a further hatred, of each other. It is not your Dissenting-parties: neither, Those whom ye call Malignants; who were able So weak to make you; so dishonourable; And, in so bad a plight, as you are in, If your own Members, had not faulty been: Nor had your City, or the Army moved, In any course, which might not be approved, If they had felt no influence upon them, From higher Pow'rs, which thereunto had won them, Nor had so many men, right well-affected, (And by whose purse, and pow'r, you were protected) Been drawne into misactings, and mistakings, (Which falsly are misconstrued forsakings, Of their first love) but, that the policies Of some among you, drew before their eyes Those mists; and practised those juggling sleights, Which kept the safest course, out of their sights. And, what that was, or what that yet, may bee, Few, have discover'd, by ought I can see: But, were it knowne, you could not rectifie Those things among you, which are now awry, Till you reform your selves; for, well ye know, Foul springs above, make filthy streams below. But, why should I complaine of you so much? Alas! you were at first, begotten such; The Fathers of your being, in this Nation, Were an unsound, corrupted Generation; And, did begin a Representative, As like themselves, as ever, man alive Begot a child: with members, crooked, lame, Blind, deaf, and dumb, into the world you came, And, such, they have continu'd ever since: Theirs therefore is the Fault; theirs the offence. You that are lawfull Members, have enough Been plagu'd, and troubled with such rotten stuffe: And, rather should be pitied and aided, In helping you, to purge them, then upbraided, With their defects. I therefore, have appear'd, That, you, of those obstructions, may be clear'd Which interrupt; and, that, whilst there is time, You may regain your honour, lost by them: That, I might likewise, help bring back unto you The peoples hearts, and make them firme unto you, By shewing them their errors, and, how, they To late lost happinesse, may find their way: And, having found it, how they may persever, By GOD's assistance, in good waies, for ever. My purpose therefore, in what followes now, Is joyntly, to prefer to them and you, Some things considerable, that may lend Assistance unto that, which I intend. If, good effects this takes, your cares, and fears, Are likely to be shortned manie years: For, know, GODS promises, and threats, are all Contingencies, and but conditionall: If you continue mad, the plagues will last: If you repent, they quickly will be past: Let ev'ry one contribute thereunto A true endeavour, his owne part to do: In what I'm born for, I will do my best: And, when that's done, GOD, shall perform the rest. The restauration of this Parliament, To their due reputation; to prevent The bondage of the People; and to bring All things to right, betwixt you, and your King, Is that, wherein, I have with good intention, Imploid, long time, the best of my invention; Yet, there appears no likelihood to me, Of saving any one, of all the three, From hazzard, or from plagues, that linger shall, But, by a reconciling of them all. And, I conceive it will deserve more thank, To play the Artist, then the Mountebank; Who leaves the course, that's naturall, and sure; To raise his credit by a desp'rate cure. He, that, by way of Chymistry would act, And, her Three Principles hope to compact Into one Body; ere he compasse shall His end, must first prepare each Minerall Secundum Artem, taking that away, Which hinder their incorporation may; And, adding that, which doth unite their natures: So, he that would his Trinity of creatures Make up again, in one, must do the same, And, now, about that royall work I am; Which, if I keep a rightly tempred fire, Will bring forth that production I desire. With Salt of true sinceritie, and reason, Your hearts, and understandings, I would season; With Sulphur of true Magnanimity, Or Courage; with the perfect Mercury Of Christian Prudence, I will temperate, And, so essentially incorporate These, throughout all your Faculties, that none Should hinder that, which I am driving on; And, therefore, have projected a conclusion Wherein, I'le first begin with an Infusion; Oh, lend me but some water from your eyes, Wherewith to make it; and it shall suffice. Lamemt, Lement your errors, and begin To see, what great distractions you are in. Of those Precipitations, take more heed, Whereto you now are hasting on with speed; Observe how busily in selfe-destroying, And, raising works, against a free enjoying Of your owne Peace you are. Consider on Your purposes; and that which you have done; And mark, if either those things you pursue, Or, yet intend, are like to profit you, Whilst ev'ry man, (though better be profest) Aimes, but at his owne single interest. By most among you, that is least intended, Which he in outward seeming, hath befriended. By making show, of things that should be done, For publike profit, you so carry on, Your private interest, that verie few The generall advantages pursue: Yea, King, Priest, People, Commoner and Peere, So wilfully, to their own claimes adhere, That, they will much indanger alltogether; And, prove like fire, and fewell to each other, If, God, prevent not, by a selfe-denying; And, by a more considerate complying. Give heed to those Predictions, which foretold Upon good grounds, what, now, yee do behold To be fullfil'd; and, which, behold ye may To be fullfiling on you, ev'rie day; And, think not, though you them, or him disdaine Who spake them, that, they were foretold in vaine. Mark how all Parties, and all Factions, run Those courses, wherein, others were undone, Whom they impeached, and condemned, too, But some few months before, for doing so. Remember, and consider, since this War Did first begin, how many changes are To be observ'd: How inconsiderable The meanes, and Persons were, who did enable Your weakned Parties; and oft gave them life When they were stooping, almost, past releef; And think it possible, there may befall Another change, when you seem sure of all; Because, you neither credit what is told; Nor heedfull are, of that which you behold. Remember and consider, what faire hopes (When an assurance, almost, crown'd their tops,) Have unto nothing vanish'd: what brave showes Of Martiall fortitude, against your foes; Of zealous faithfulnesse unto the State, And piety to God, have fail'd of late; And left benighted, an ascending Fame Before 'twas noone, within a cloud of shame. And think how possible, it may be, yet, To see new stormes, before the sun be set: For, that which hath been, you againe may see, As long, as in the selfesame round you bee. Remember, and consider, in what fear, You have been in, what things then vowed were; What Holinesse, you seemed to pretend; What cause, you then protested to befriend; What warnings, and what caveats have been given, By judgements, mercies; yea, by men, and heaven: What private, and what publike fasting daies, What times of giving solemne thanks, and praise, Have celebrated been, without that fruit Which either with Humility, may suit, Or, with true Gratitude: and when you see How full of filthinesse, your best workes bee, Think, what your worst may prove; and, what event Will follow them, unlesse you shall repent. When, these things you have thought upon, then mind Whereto, your promises, have you design'd, What fearfull Imprecations, you have made; What wonderfull protections, you have had; What witnesses there are, of what you do; What forraign foes; what foes domestick too, Expect advantage: And, such things, as these VVhen you have thought on, with due seriousnesse, Think, also, what may thereupon redound, If, falshood in your hearts, be likewise found; And, when you have provoked GOD, and men, What plagues, and horrors, will surprize you then. Remember, and consider, with what lyings, What perjuries, what falshoods and complyings With wicked men and meanes, you have assaid To perfect those designes, which you have laid; How, ev'rie Faction, takes delight to jeer At their own shame, and, to relate and heare With merriment, each others wickednesse, And, what the scurrill Pamphleters expresse, To their reproach, when they should rather mourne, Then impudently laugh themselves to scorne: Beleeve it, till Authority prescribes A mulct for liers (chiefly lying Scribes) And take more notice of that sleighted sin, Which one prime cause of all your strifes have bin, Peace will not settle; for, when one warr's done, Another, by a lie, may be begun. Weigh, and consider, of what Tyrannies, Of what prophanenesse, of what blasphemies, Of how much malice, and of what black crimes, You have been guilty, (ev'n in these sad times) On either side. And, when you well have thought On these things; think likewise, how much you ought To grieve, and to repent, that, God might spare Those thteatned judgements, which deserved are; For, 'tis meere madnesse, to expect his grace, Or look for Peace, so long, as in the face Of men, and Angells, you persist in evills, As if you thought, there were nor GOD, nor Devills. Think, and consider, with a serious thought, To what a giddie posture all is brought: In what confusion, your affaires you see, In what amazements, now, the wisest bee; In what a feare, the valiant, and the strong, Now are, or will be, ere it shall be long; How manifold, your sub-divisions are; What symptomes of destruction do appeare; How impudently still, you palliate The falshooes of those Members of the State, And, of those Agents, who abuse their trust; How all things, out of order, they do thrust, Through want of Justice; how, they daily sad Mens hearts; &amp; how, when they have made them mad, They punish them, because, they could not use Those wits, which their oppressions made them lose. Mark, and consider, with what shamelesnesse, Your Holy Flatt'rers, do bepaint and dresse Their Patrons in the Parliament, as tho It were not possible they should misdo: How others, make the Army, at the least, S. Michael, and his Angells; how, the rest, So impudently do extoll the King, As if he were a Saint in ev'rie thing. And, needed no repentance, for ought done, In former time, or since this Warre begun: And, while such daubings are, consider you, If penitence be likely to ensue, Or wilfulnesse; and therewith mind I pray, Which of the two are Traytors, either they Who, mind a misled King, or Parl'ament, Of those things which destruction may prevent; Or, they, who fawne, and flatter them to hell, By calling evill doings, doing well: They, who by Justice would uphold the Throne; Or, they, who praise men for what pulls it downe. When these things are consider'd, then to mend What is amisse, your best endeavours bend. Let all those carnall policies, by which The world your understandings doth bewitch, Be laid aside: let those designes wherein 'Tis evidently seen, that you have been Without successe; be quite by you abjur'd: Yea, since experience often hath assur'd That, those effects, which you have had thereby, Did still exasperate, and multiply Your fears, and griefs; mind, what experience showes, And, trust no more, such broken reeds as those. To no Dissenting-party be unjust; Nor falsifie so much, the Common-trust, As by your private mutuall promises, To barter for your owne advantages; Or, in your Treaties, at the publike cost, To seek our selves, till you, and all is lost: But, still in your proceedings, let pure Truth Preserved be, both in your heart and mouth; So, God, who marketh, what you act and say, Will help to guide you, out of your dark way; Advance that Kingdome, whereto you pretend; And, make your greatest enemie, your friend: Yea, make among you, Truth, and Peace prevaile Though King and Parliament, your hopes may faile. Eschew Hypocrisie; take heed of Pride, And, of what thing soever may divide The people, th'Army, or the Parliament; And them into those new Divisions rent, Which at this present are of many feared; And, for which, Engines are in secret reared. But, chiefly at this time, think not in vaine, On that State-Principle, Divide, and Reigne. For, at this Juncture, thereupon depends Your welfare; and your Adversaries ends. Whatever, therefore, shall be now advis'd By others, let not this note be despis'd; Take heed of an Adjournmint, till you see The Kingdomes in a better posture bee; Lest, when you are divided from each other, You lose the meanes to meet againe together, By some contrivance; and, by somewhat done, Which at this present day you think not on. Though all are much to blame, let all provide Their best expedients, to amend, or hide Those failings in each other, which will spread No further, by their being covered. Forgive, (as much as may be) one another; That love may knit your scatter'd force together: Lest, on a sudden, some prevailing pow'r, Not yet appearing, all at once devour. Let neither Parliament, nor People spare To keep themselves in armes, as yet they are: For, though the burden, greivous may be thought, Your safety will not be so dearly bought, As your destruction may. Let now, likewise All Pow'rs, all Councells, and Authorities, Use ev'ry prudent way, and means, whereby The people may not feare a Tyranny; Nor feel a present weight, which may appeare A greater Burthen, then the thing they seare. But, use of all cautions, to impose it so, That, such as lay it, may help bear it too; So, shall the people know, 'tis laid on them, For their owne safety; and, but for a time. And, that, the threefold Cable be not broke, Which holds your Anchor, let all care be tooke; That, City, Shires, and Army, yeeld and give (As to their Bulworke, and Preservative, Next under GOD) unto this Parl'ament Respect, obedience, and each complement Of duty, which may re-enable them, To vindicate their honour, and esteem, From those obliquities, now thereon throwne By others, and some Members of it owne: Yea, though some part thereof, hath been to blame, (As all Terrestrialls are) know; that, their shame And suffrings, will be yours; know, that the fault Is your, that many of their Members halt: Know, that, their Foes, who seek to aggravate Their crimes to you, have done it out of hate To them, and you; and, not with an intent, That you should lesse be greev'd, or they repent: But, that, you should be mad, and make them roome, Into their places back againe to come, And double your Oppressions: which, the while With tears they pity, like the Crocodile. Yea, know; that, if you in this storme, forsake This Vessell, (though it bruized be, and leake) Your Fortunes, will be therewith shipwrackt found, If that sink, you shall certainly be drown'd. For, in this torne, and ancient Vessell lies That, which must free you from the slaveries You have been in; and, keep you likewise, free From those, in which, you are afraid to bee. Herein, are all your stores, for war and peace, Of safety, honour; and, of Trades encrease: And, therefore joyne with courage; use your pow'rs, Wit, wealth, and, ev'ry facultie of yours, To stop the leakes, which it hath lately sprung, To keep it tite, and make it faire and strong. Oh, all you, who have therein fraught, or share, Whether, ye Masters, Captains, Pilots are, Cape-Masters, Souldiers, Sailers, Passengers, Or, (as all some way are) Adventurers; Consider, I beseech you, what a losse There would befall, if some new storme should tosse This Vessell on the Rocks: Or, if there should Some Traytors, in her Cabines, or her hold, Lie closely, unsuspected, or unseen, And blow up all her Decks, and Magazeene, By some concealed traine; or, spring a Leake About the keel, whilst you unwisely seek, (With quarrelling) for vailes, or private shares, Amongst the desperatest Mutineers. The slaves, your pris'ners, and amongst the rest, Your Malecontents, it may be, will suggest That, your Commanders, and your Pilots may Make prizes of you; and, take all away By Arbitrary Pow'r: For there are some Who (hoping, if you jealous will become, It would effect their ends) have whisperings, Among their other mischiefe-breeding things, To this effect; that, if you make them strong, They will improve that strength, unto your wrong, And, faile your trust. But, dreame not; think not so, Nor, erre you, from your duties, though they do. What change in them soever, might be wrought; What e're they do, yet do you what you ought. Keep to your Principles, though they may range; Saile by the same Card; though the winds do change; And, that you may not fear what will ensue, Look back, a little, and things past review. When, lately, by an Arbitrary might You were opprest, and in so great a straight, That you perceiv'd no meanes your selves to free, From your oppressions; nor ought like to bee, Whereby, to scape from thrall you should be able; (Without attempts, then deemed treasonable) Loe then, ev'n at that time; and, when your King A double Chaine on you, assay'd to bring, And thought, together in one teame to yoke, His Oxen, and his Asses; then GOD broke The Royall snare: and, wonderfully wrought. For your deliverance, to passe he brought By what was never call'd to that intent; By what, which never more to call he meant; Ev'n by a Parlament: to which he gave A pow'r to be, whilst being it would have; With Priviledges, which by Pow'r divine, Were made destructive, to his owne designe: For, lawfull pow'r it got, and just occasion, To arme against a tyrannous invasion; And, your estates, and freedomes were defended By that, which for a mischiefe, was intended. So, if this Parl'ament degenerate From what it should be, and from what of late, You thought it was; and, shall imploy that pow'r Which was from you receiv'd; and which is your, To raise themselves, upon a publike wrong; GOD, them will break, when they appear most strong; Cause those, whom they depend on, to deceive them; Of all their expectations, quite bereave them; And by some lawfull way, which yet appears To no mans eye, preserve you from your fears. For, ev'ry tyrannizing pow'r shall clash Against each other, and to peices dash, All those, and their designes, who shall comply With any instruments of Tyranny; That passage may be made, to raise up that Which is the strength and honour of a State. If yet, your former doubtings be not past, But that th'aspersions, which on them are cast, Whom GOD for your deliverers hath chose, Hath shooke you from your confidence in those; Or if defects, which may be found in them, Do either urge, or tempt you to contemne Such instruments; and in your hearts to say, Can these men save us? Mindfull be, I pray, What persons, to your aid, GOD, first did call; By what sleight meanes he hath effected all Your conquests. Yea, by what contrary things His works, he, often to perfection brings. Consider how this Army was despis'd And scorned, when it was first modelliz'd: How, likely, were they, whom you first did gather To be your guard, to be your ruine, rather Then to defend you? how, did they protest, And rage, when they against their wills were prest? With how much weaknesse was that work begun? And, yet, thereby what wonders hath God done? How, hath he added unto your prevailings, By them, though they their errors had and failings? How, hath he humbled you by their great pride, Whose seeming vertues you have glorifi'd? That, you may see a pow'r so excellent, Knowes how to work with any instrument: That, you may find there are some things despis'd, VVhich have deserved, better to be priz'd; That you may learne in weake meanes, not to feare; Nor trust too much, in those that mighty are; That, you may know, if your owne waies be streight, You may be safe, though others go not right; And, though you will not know it; they who live By faith, the truth of these things do perceive; And, would in GOD, find out a pleace to dwell, Though, there were neither heav'n, earth nor hell. Their credit must be kept, their pow'r obey'd, On whom your trust, and Guardianship is laid; And from that duty, none can be excus'd, Though some among them, have that trust abus'd: For, as he is a man, that hath a soule, Although his body, he with Ulcers fowle, Maim'd, blind and deafe; and, may from you thereby, Claime all the duties of your charity: So, though the Body Representative, May wounds, and many blemishes receive; Yet, therein, is the soule of Government: And, therefore, all you whom they represent, Obedience owe thereto, in ev'ry thing; Excepting an obedience that may bring Those publike hazzards, which are so apparent, That in themselves, they bring a sealed Warrant Of disobligement: And, in those things too, So must you then proceed, in what ye do, That your owne consciences may truly say, Obedience, onely, made you disobey: And, that, the world may see, by your proceed, That GOD, and Justice, hath approv'd the deed. Though crack'd, your Bulwork be, and faulty grown; This is no time, to sleight, or pull it downe: But, to repaire it rather, lest you leave Your selves unguarded, and a blow receive. This is no time to shake the Reputation Of those, who are your onely preservation; But, rather, to uphold it, by removing The scandalous; by cherishing, approving, And strength'ning those, among them, by whose wit, And honesty, they have a being yet. Informe them better, who are much abus'd, (By false opinions, into them infus'd) And, thereupon your Supreme Court defame; As doing, arbitrarily, the same, Which, was denied lawfull in the King: For, they should know, that ev'n the selfe-same thing May be both just, and unjust: He, doth take Unlawfully, your goods, a prize to make, To satisfie his lust, or, to destroy Those Freedomes, and those Rights, you should injoy: They, take a portion, from you, orderly, (And thereto forced by necessity) To save your priviledges; and, prevent The losse of all, by that, which he hath spent. Their actions, are not bounded, in that Law, Whereby, men out of Parl'ament should draw The Line of their proceedings; But, by that Which is the first foundation of a State: By that Supreme Law, whereby pow'r they had, To make or change the Lawes, alreadie made; And, for the Publike-safety, to provide: By that Law, they must act; and, are not ti'd To any other, when, necessity Shall, for the weale of your Community, The contrary require: For, otherwise, They meet in vaine, about those remedies, Which are desir'd; and, do but time employ To marre the benefit they would enjoy; And, strengthen Tyrants, in their usurpations Upon the Rights and Freedomes, of the Nations. Let no man therefore say, when they shall vary From former Lawes, their Acts are arbitrary, Injuriously; since, your experience sees, That strong necessity, at sometimes frees, Ev'n private persons from adhering to, The Letter of the Law, in what they do. The mannaging of Publike Interests, In th'Agents reputation, much consists. 'Tis Reputation, makes a Kingdome strong, And rich; and keeps it from affronts, and wrong. 'Tis that which maketh Lawes: For, neither wit Nor humane Pow'r, are able to beget That Priviledge; because, if Pow'r should make them A greater Pow'r, by right of Pow'r, would break them. If Wit, and Reason, would a lawe devise, There are so many, seeming to be wise, That they would make such over-long debates, And work so variously, in sev'rall pates, That, if to make a Law, some should agree, By others, it should straight repealed bee. And, if more Settlement, were not obtain'd, By Reputation, then, there can be gain'd By Pow'r, and Wit, or, Reason; you, would never Agree; but, fight, or else, debate for ever. Take therefore, of their good repute, a care, On whose repute, your Safeties builded are: For, when that once is lost; it proveth not A Jewell, which may easily be got; Nor, is there any precious stone, yet knowne That gives a fairer lustre to a Crowne. With Reputation may a single man Do more sometime, them twenty thousands can. A Cities uproars, sooner it restraines, Then all their Scarlet Gownes, and Golden Chains: And dares make stand, the peoples rage to stay, When Wit, and Wealth and Titles run away: Yea, calmes them sooner; and scapes better too, Then honesty, and innocency do. I know not any thing that can so soone, Bring universall Discords into tune: Nor, know I ought, that's in it self so vaine, And empty, which doth so much pow'r obtaine In humane actions; and, there is not now, A Nation, whom it more concernes then you, (Consid'ring, what your present postures are) To keep your Senates reputation cleare. For, should I shew your postures in a glasse, No Puppet-play, that ere devised was Came neere it; neither did you ever see An Antick like that shew, which there would bee: Such fruitlesse hopes, such fears, such mimick actions, Such turnings, windings, sidings, such distractions, Were never represented, on the Stage Of anie Common-wealth, in anie Age. There you should view a thousand contradictions, A thousand fancies, fooleries, and fictions, Repeated, personated, sworne, beleeved; And, men, accordingly, made glad or greeved; And, acting that in their false joy, and sorrow, Which they must backward act againe to morrow. From Ireland, this man bringeth heavy newes; From Scotland, that man little better shewes; One tells what Plots, are in the City laid: Another, of the Army, what is said. A third with an affrighted look, doth bring A tale of some designement, with the King, By Scots, and by Malignants; and, then stands As if he had new purchas'd Bishops Lands. A fourth is much dismayed by some tales Of risings in the Counties, and in Wales; As if he fear'd a sudden separation From somewhat, which he holds by Sequestration. A fifth hath heard from Holland, or from France, He knowes not what, yet fall, into a trance, As if his conscience knew of somwhat done, Which he then wisht, had never been begun. Another shewes, another way, his folly, And looks as sadly, and as melancholy, As if he were surprized with a dread Of losing some great place, or, of his head. And, at the turning of the wind or tide, Upon some pleasing newes on t'other side, Starts up as they do, when a Piper plaies, Who, have been bitten by Tarantula's You, would not, thus, with ev'ry novell noise Be fill'd with Panick fears, and gannick joyes; Or, moved be, with ought, which others did, If you, your owne affaires, would better heed. This, would not be, were men imploid about Internall things, as on those things without; Nor would they be so giddily affrighted, With things abroad, if things at home be righted. He, that his way, with sobernesse doth go, Dreads not the furious marching of a foe. He, who takes care to keep his conscience clear, Shakes not, when evill tidings he doth hear. He, that endeavours warrantable things, Fears not the pow'r of Senators or Kings; Nor, should you ever need to feare a jot What by the Welch, or Irish, French, or Scot Could be design'd or done; or, what the King With all his party, to effect could bring; Nor, what an open, or a secret foe, By pow'r, or by his policy, could do, Either within these Ilands, or abroad, If you repose true confidence in GOD; And, give him, but sincere, and contrite hearts To joyn, with him, in acting of your parts: No, though your slips, and Ignorances were As many, and as great, as now they are. Let all the sev'rall Nations of these Iles, Who liv'd in love, and Amity, ere whiles, Unite againe, and seek each others peace; That, their encreasing strifes, and plagues may cease. Let, our Welch-Britans, (who their actions square By those things, which they but suspect, or heare) Recover, so much, of their humane reason, As teaches them, a difference 'twixt Treason, And Lawes of Nature; that it may make place, To bring them nearer; to the law of Grace. That, so, they may not, still, beleeve, and doe, Both by implicite Faith, and reason, too: For, when they truly know what doth belong Unto themselves, and, their owne right and wrong, They, will the sooner, be informed, then, What duties doe belong to other men; And, grow more wise, by this Epitomie Of Lawes divine, and true morality; Do, as yee would be done to, then, all they Who pore upon their Law books ev'ry day; And, would be thought experienced, in all Lawes Cannon, Civill, and Municipall. If this advice they follow, they shall dwell In safety on their hills, and live as well Among their vallies and their Glins, in Wales, As on the fruitful'st Southerne Downes, and Dales. Then let them practise it; and not call to them, A wasting desolation, to undo them. Let them not woo, uncivill civill wars, To clime up to their Mountaines, Rocks and skars: For, if they find them rich, they'l leave them poore; If needy, they will make them need the more; They bring, the worst, into a worse estate; And crash the Bones, where they can suck no fat. Let your Scotch-Britans, so insist upon Their interest, that, nothing may be done, Against their Brethrens rights; and, so preserve Their Leauges, that willfully, they do not swerve From any Branch thereof; and let them so Observe the Covenant, as men that know The letter of it, or, a circumstance, Is not to be pursued to th'advance, Of any sense or practise, which may lame The essence, and intentions of the same. For, if they make the letter to extend, Beyond the true intentions, and the end Of what was covenanted; and, so weaken That interest for which the same was taken, They are deceivers, and worse hypocrites Then were of old, the cunning Gibeonites. Let, therefore, that stout Nation well advise Among themselves, wherein the diffrence lies Betwixt the Kingdoms; lest, perhaps, it drawes A mischief on both Nations, without cause; And, bring on those ingagements, which may lose The love, the peace, the honour, and those dues Which now are claim'd; &amp;, make them lose their blood, And Countrey too, as far as it is good. Let them not think, that their accommodation, The profit, or advantage of one Nation, Prefer'd should be, in any thing at all, Before these Islands weal in generall. Let them seek nothing, but what Iustice may Allow them; lest she take both that away, On which they seiz'd; and, therewith, all the rest, Which, formerly was lawfully possest. For, Justice more secures, and more enriches Then policy, although that more bewitches: And, neither wealth, nor honour, can be lost, By honesty; though sometime she be crost. That Nation have done well, to think upon The bringing of the King back to his Throne; If from right Principles the motion came: But, on them it would bring perpetuall shame, If they recall'd him, without penitence Of those faults, for which they first drove him thence. For, that they quarrell'd with him first, none doubt; And, they were with the last, who pull'd him out. That people is too wise, to call him home, Ere he shall truly penitent become; And by some satisfying expiations, Hath perfectly secured both the Nations: For, if he bring the same heart back, they know, He will, as soon as he shall able grow, Avenge himself on them, as upon those, Who were the first, from whom his troubles rose. Let them not give their friends just cause to lay That to their charge, which Foes of them do say, Their Brethrens portion, let them not envy; Or, look upon it with an evill eye; Nor, let our English haughtily, despise Their Northerne Brethrens kind compliances; Or, sleight their friendship; or, (puft up with pride) Their want of superfluities, deride: But, by how much more GOD, hath seem'd to blesse, Their Clymate, with a greater fruitfulnesse, So much the more, respectively, let them Be carefull, that they no way do contemn Their Lot; lest GOD, for that ingratitude Justly permit some other to intrude On their inheritance; and, make them glad To seek worse habitations, then they had. Yea, let both Nations strive with all their mights, To fortifie each other in their Rights; And be assur'd, that which of them soever Shall first to break ther late sworn League endeavour, Shall both be ruin'd; and, if both make void Their solemn Vowes, then both shall be destroy'd. Let both remember well, that Covenant, Which they have sworn; and, how much yet they want Of perfecting their Vowes to God, and Man; That they may keep them better, if they can. Know; you have entred into leauge together, Not to insnare, but to secure each other: And, that your Treaties, were not to get more From one or t'other, then they had before, But, that, thereby, they stronger might be made, Against him, who, did all their rights invade. Know, that your Covenant was not contrived, That Christian liberty should be deprived: Or make that for a Jus divinum go, Which neither was, nor can be proved so. Or, to compell men to renounce, admit; Or, to accord, as those, or these, thought fit; (Or, as the best reformed Churches had it) Ought further then GODS word authentick made it. It is not possible that any Nation Should make a vow, upon consideration, To pin their Faith upon anothers sleeve; Things to professe, which they cannot beleeve; To practise, what their consciences abhor, And what they find, no lawfull warrant for; But, sure their meaning was, men should assay To get the truths perfection if they may, Till otherwise, they find it; to adhere To those as truths, which truths to them appeare; That, from compulsion, all men should be free, Where doubtings are, till they decided be; And, that, your vow injoyned none to do, More, then their pow'r, and place, oblig'd him too. Let both remember, that, they vowed have The Person of the King, from harme to save; His honour to preserve (and what belongs To him, of right) from violence, and wrongs: But, this remember, too, that, when you made This vow, you likewise, resolutions had, That, therein, his protection should extend, No further, then you thereby might defend The Kingdomes priveledges, and maintaine Those rights, which to the people appertaine: For, els, you shall betray your greatest trust, And, prove but hypocritically just. Remember, you have vowed to endeavour To bring to publike triall, whomsoever You shall discover, either to divide The Kingdomes, or, to make the people side In factions; and, that, you have vow'd to strive (As you are able) that, they may receive Due punishment: And, mark, if you have bin As faithfull, as you promised therein. Halt not 'twixt two opinions, as ye do; If Baal be to be serv'd, let it be so. Either, you have a pow'r, or you have none: If none; why act yee, still, as ye have done? Either your King, or you, deserveth blame: If you have traitors been, repent the same; Acknowledge it; submit, implore for grace; And let him take againe, his pow'r and place. If he, as much demerit, as you say; Do not your trust, and your owne lives betray; But, quit your selves like men, and do your best To vindicate their cause, who are opprest. If both be faulty, then, let both amend; Lest, both be quite destroyed in the end. If, you have drove the naile unto the head, There clinch it; let no more be done, or said: For, why should this brave Island be destroid, That in the mean time, some should be imploid Thereby to raise themselves? and, to prepare Well-feather'd nests, perhaps, some otherwhere? Those evill Counsellers, which late appear'd To be about the King, may now be fear'd To be among your selves; and, they of whom The King, was made most fearfull to become, Have now compli'd with him; and, justly may King, People, Scotch, and English, if they weigh What hath been done, shake hands, and well agree; For, they are all, as like, as like can be. Come, come, repent together, and forgive; For there's no other means, in peace to live; And, when you are forgiving, let all share A part of Mercy, who repentant are. Let, our seduced Irish, who, among The rest, are yet involved in the throng Of murth'rous Rebells; but have guiltlesse bin Of their inhumane, and loud crying sin, Find some Gate open, whereby they might gaine An entrance, your forgivenesse to obtaine; (Upon repentance, and on evidence, Produced, differencing their offence:) For, some of them assisted, to their might, Their brethren, in their terrified flight, Against destroiers; and in secret stood Betwixt them, and the seekers of their blood. Some of them, then, so far forth as they durst, Releev'd them in their hunger, and their thirst; Cover'd their nakednesse; and them convei'd (From those, by whom they should have been betraid) To Townes, and Ports, wherein they might avoid That rage, whereby they had been els destroid. If these, withdraw themselves, and back recede From them whose hands in blood were deeply di'd; Receive them unto mercy; that, you may By justice, therewith mixed, take away That Kingdomes guilt; and, put a difference Betwixt the smaller, and the great offence, That, they, whom other men did hurry on, Against their wills, to be with them undone, May find a passage out of that distresse Which they are in, by others wickednesse; And, that repentance, may not be without A comfortable hope of some good fruit, To ev'ry sinner, when he shall endeavour A reformation, at what time soever. By this course, you shall make the freer passe, For your owne selves, unto the Throne of grace: By this course, you shall greatly weaken those Who, are your willfull unrepentant foes; And, strengthen much their hands, who have been true To GOD, unto their Countrey, and to you. It may be, too, fullfil'd shall be, thereby, That antient well knowne Irish Prophecy, By which, unto that Nation, 'twas foretold, That, there would come a time, wherein they should Weepe ore your English Graves: For some, no doubt, Already, tears of pitty have powr'd out; Ev'n when they saw the cruell butcheries Of guiltlesse Englishmen, before their eies? And, now, shall ore their Graves, for their offence Shed tears again, through heartie penitence. Let those dissenting Parties, and those Factions Which, long have multiplied your Distractions, Leave of those many names of separations, Of scorn, and disesteem, which in these Nations Do now abound, and wherewith you provoke Each other; and, whereby the peace is broke, And malice nourished: for they prolong Your discords, by a still renewing wrong. Let, not all those, who term'd, of late, have been Malignants, find that name, still set between Themselves, and others, when they have assaid To make amends, and their redemption paid. For, by that Bar, you keep the Breach unclosed 'Twixt them, whose quarrells might els be composed. For such of them, as only were misled In judgement, have not thereby forfeited Their honestie; as all those men have done Who wilfully, and knowingly went on. Nor, halfe so much as those, who have compli'd With both sides; or, been false to either side. Yet, trust them not with pow'r, till you have tri'd Their truth; and, till your Peace is fortifi'd. Let Innocents, defend their reputations, As freely, as Knaves make their accusations. Good turnes vouchsafe, to honest men sometime, As willingly, as you do mischieve them: For, to undo a man, you soone give ear; Have tongues to speak, and leisure time to hear, Within an houres warning; but, before You heare him for his good, a yeare, and more, Yea, sometimes three, four, five, consumed be, Yet neither end, nor hope of end, hath he. Let those who for your service, fit are knowne, Both by abilities, and courage showne; Those, who for you, their lives have hazarded; Contributed, and lent their childrens bread; For your sakes, brought themselves, and families From plenty, to extreme necessities, (Through want of that respect, which you should show them, Till you have means to pay them what you owe them. Let those, not like old shoes, be hurled by, As if they were not worth your memory, Or fit for nothing; when malignant Jacks, Who laugh, and jeere at you behind your backs, Can fill so manie places; and grow rich, Whilst better men, lie starving in a ditch. If spent your Treasure be, then let them share In your Imployments, till you abier are To pay them what is due; So, you shall ease them: So, you, with hope of better, shall well please them: So, you, in life, and health, may then sustaine, Till you have need of honest men againe: For, when their Countrey wants help, these, are they Who will not faile her, though them faile she may. Take these last words among you, where they fall; And, as occasion, make them usefull shall: For, your confusion so confoundeth me, That want of method, may accused be Where all is well intended; and, where nought Is more, then may be profitably taught, Let those among you, who desire to plead For Christian Libertie, take serious heed They make not passages, which may let in Licentiousnesse, and Liberty of sin. Let them not seek to ratifie Devotion, To nothing but an incorporall notion; Lest, if no place for shaddowes, they allow, They never come their substances to know: Lest, if too far away, from Formes they fly, They fall into some fowle deformity; Or lest, when they think purest light to see, They blinded by an over-weening bee. And you, who think, that by a Law-Divine There is, one outward forme of Discipline, To be observ'd of all men; and, but one That can be lawfull; which, by you alone, Is now in practise: somewhat bear I pray, With such, as cannot yet, approve your way To be infallible; or, give consent To make essentiall, what's different. When you possesse the Wheat, brawl not for Darnell, Fight not for shells, when you enjoy the Kernell. If to the true Foundation they adhere, Against their buildings, be not too severe; For, if the Structures they erect thereon, Be Gold, and Silver, they have wisely done: If Straw, and Stubble, theirs will be the losse; The Fiery-triall, will consume the drosse; And, they themselves, (though from perdition free) Will in themselves, enough afflicted bee. With love and kindnesse, seek to bring them in, Who, by misse-teaching have deluded been: With patience, and long-suffring wait upon Your Brethren, as on you, your GOD hath done; And, if their errors be but imperfections, And not of malice, let your good affections Be exercis'd thereby; and, then perchance Your Charity, shall cure their ignorance, And, sooner win them, then your indignation, Severitie, or bitter provocation. Compulsion often formes an Hypocrite, But never makes the will, or heart upright: And he, that would not vaine conclusions try, The consciences of men to rectifie, Must act, by somwhat which is more divine, Then torments, or a Formall Discipline. Speak not in Tempests, when you would reforme; GOD, oftner comes in Calmes, then in a Storme. Ill words, corrupt good manners; and, there flowes From jeerings, brawlings, from your brawlings blowes; And, many times, the woundings of your swords, Break not the peace, so much as bitter words. Provide therefore, as wisely as you may To take provoking speeches quite away; Especially among those, who pretend The Cause of God, and goodnesse to befriend: For, they, who cannot their sharp tongues restraine, Professe, and talk of Piety, in vaine. Yea, they, who are Truths Champions with their tongues, And want true love, have done the greatest wrongs. Let not your Supreme City over-swell That Mediocrity, which heeded well, Would more secure her safety, more enlarge Her honour, and diminish more her charge. Though she be great, let her not seeke to awe Those, who, to her, and all the rest give law. Though she be rich, let her not trust unto Her riches; lest at last, they her undo. Though she be strong, let her not boast therein; For, some, by their owne strength, have ruin'd bin. Though she be wise, let her not think to fool Her Tutors, and to set them new to school: But, let her motions, be in her owne sphere, According as her owne occasions are; Let her advance her tradings, without wrong To priviledges, which to all belong: Endeavour, by continuall watchfulnesse, Both how, she may prevent, and how suppresse Sedition, routs, and tumults: for these be The bane of Cities: and I do foresee, (Unlesse, prevented; by good takeing heed) That then a mischiefe, may to you proceed, Whereby, you more may suffer, in one hour, Then in an whole yeare, by a Martiall pow'r. Returne to your first love, and be not jealous Of those, who mean you well, or over-zealous In prosecuting, or beleeving, all, Which your pretended Lovers counsell shall. Contribute that proportion of due aid, For, publike safety, which on you is laid, According to the Portion of the blessing, Which is thereby, preserv'd, in your possessing. With praiers, and obedience, them assist, Who stand up for the common Interest, And take good heed, lest those who shall pretend Your benefit, may drive some other end; And, overthrow the common peace, and you, By those proceedings, which they now pursue. You have done well, and bravely; loose not then Your thanks, and your deserved praise, agen. You, of the Souldiery; Men of the Sword, Receive you Orders too, and take a word Of good advice: for much it will concerne The publike weal, that you your duties learne. Neglect not discipline, thereto adhere; And, therein, alwaies rather be severe Then too remisse: for, when an Army shall Into disorder and confusion fall; Destruction to it selfe, it will become: And, of all enemies, most perilsome To publike safety. And, 'tis better far (Whether it be in time of peace, or war) To suffer, by obedience to good order; Then due redresse, by mutinie, to further. Remember, that, you were not arm'd or paid, To do your own work, but for publike aid: And, that, you to your Officers are bound, No further, then while faithfull they are found To those, who have intrusted them; and, that If they oppresse, ther's meanes to regulate What is amisse; and, pow'r that may restrain Their insolencies, if you shall complain. Think not your selvs their creatures, as some name you: For such an attribute doth much defame you. There is in them no power of creation, By dignity, by place, or by Relation, Whereby they any creatures can produce, But sonnes, and daughters, or fleas, wormes, and lice: And these, are (properly) but generated, Or, els, by their corruption propagated. Delay not publike peace, by private hate; Each others noble actions emulate, Out-vie, but them envie not; neither crosse Each other, to your countries further losse. Upon your foes, ther's honour to be got Sufficient, with your friends then, quarrell not. Seek not, to be aveng'd, for that offence, Upon the publike, which your innocence By private hands hath suffred; measure not Your merit, by the conquests, you have got; But, by that worth, which truely is your owne, And, in your heart lies, to the world unknowne. Judge not of worth, by actions, and events, (Which fame, it may be, falsly represents) But, by those Principles, and reall worth Whereby the heart is rouz'd and carried forth To noble undertakings: Fame that's won By having gain'd the lot of leading on Your English Mastives, (on whose side befell A victorie, whose author none can tell) Is but of small esteem; for, when confusion Hath brought their skirmishes unto conclusion, He, many times, who merited but shame, Of all that victorie, shall beare the name; And, then, opinion ev'ry day doth add Advantages, till he at last is made So arrogant, that he begins to dream Himselfe to be, what, some have fanci'd him; And, so to act, that they whom he deceiv'd; Shall soone find, what of him should be beleev'd. Be none of these, for, you have lately seen, How, such false fires extinguished have been; And, when with glory, to ascend they think, How, quickly, they descend, in smoke, and stink. Fall not from that, which you have well begun; But, persevere, untill the work be done. An instrument, you are, but nor the tongue, Nor eye, to whom, direction doth belong: Therefore assume it not; but keep them free By true obedience, who your keepers be. And be assur'd, that, if you shall comply With any to advance a tyranny Of any kind; or, up to raise, thereby, Licentiousnesse instead of Liberty: GOD will let loose a spirit; which will soone Un-nerve your Powers; make it night at noone; Destroy you with a fillip, all together; Puffe you away, like th'atoms of a feather. And you, who (if you arrogate it not Unworthily) are Stewards, for the Lot Of GOD's Anointed; heare a word or two, To mind ye, what ye know ye ought to do. You see, to what confusion all is brought By those men who themselves have onely sought: And, what destruction will succeed thereon, If in divided paths you still go on. You know, what meanes, and what advantages You have, to keep out, or to fetch in peace: And, I acknowledge some of you have walked The way of peace, as well as thereof talked: And, trumpet-like, have rais'd your voices high, To wake these Nations from their Lethargie. Let all doe so; and joyntly undertake To helpe repaire the Breach they holpe to make; And not contend for that which neither was, Nor is, nor ever can be brought to passe. Make not those things infallible to be, In which so many millions disagree: Make not those things Essentialls to appeare, Which in themselves but Circumstantialls are: And, beare with them (since they the woe must bide) Who give offences that you may be tri'd. Your Temporalities, claime by your Law, To be your due; and labour not to draw Conclusions for your selves, from inferences, Which make not warrantable your pretences: For, all your claimes, by Ceremoniall dues, Or Customes, appertaining to the Jewes, Availe you nothing; but enfeeble rather, Those Arguments, which from their Rights you gather. You may as well reduce them back againe To Sacrifices, and to entertaine All other services, now obsolete, As, get some things, which you have hope to get; And, whereto you the People would injoyne By humane Law, as due by Law divine: Which, what they are; and how from doubts to clear them, You shall be told, when you are fit to hear them. From bitter words, and sharp invectives cease; Invoke for grace, and then provoke to peace. From all your Pulpits banish all partaking In Factions; and in weak'ning or strong making This or that Party: and, pull not in, all Those things, which into controversie fall, (Or into question) within cognizance Of your owne jurisdiction, to advance Your int'rest: For, all things that can be thought, May, by that rule within your pow'r be brought: And, by that meanes, you may recover more Then hath been, here usurped heretofore. Preach Faith, Repentance, Charity, and what May true belief, and good life propagate. Be humble, keep more closely to your charge; And ramble not about so much at large, To fetch in fleeces, out of others flocks, But, be contented with your proper stocks; Lest, as befell of late, and heretofore, Instead of greater gaine, your losse be more. I more might add; but, you already know it, Oh therefore, in your practise, also, show it. You, hear, what I have said, ye British Nations, To further the desired reparations Of these distracted Kingdomes; and to bring Your King to you, and you unto your King, If you, and he, the curing will abide; And, for that Blessing, now grow qualifi'd: Or, if not both, that one of you, at least With Peace and safetie may againe be blest: And live to praise GOD, that you forth are brought From that snare, wherewith wilfulnesse is caught. I have not here deceiv'd you with faire showes From old Records, whose credit no man knowes. From temporarie Acts, worme-eaten found; (Of which, none knowes the reason, or the ground) I bring not Presidents, that do belong To things in Fact, which whether right or wrong, Were thereby done, there is no certaintie. You see, I use no kind of Sophistrie; Nor do attempt, conclusions here to draw From cheating quirks, or quiddities of Law: From abstruse Principles, Authorities, Unknowne; or, wherein little credit lies: From ought, too Magisteriall for the season; From fraudfull, or adulterated reason; But meerly, from such grounds, and such positions, As yeeld results, without all just suspitions. From nature, common practice, and those things, Whose cleare light meanes of apprehension brings To most capacities; and, (which may best Improve them) they, in language are exprest So plainely; that all those throughout the Land, (Ev'n Children) that can read, may understand. And since, men wand'ring in a wood by night, When they shall through a Glade, behold some light, Take thereby courage, to walk chearly on, In hope, their feares, and toyles, are nearely gone; Ile from a Cloud, flash out a little gleame Of Lightning; and, disclose a little beame, Whereby on you a glimmering, shall be cast, Of what you may attaine to, at the last: For, I will shew you, by what Pedigree That Government, to you deriv'd shall bee Which will, at last, these British Islands blesse With inward Peace, and outward happinesse. It was of late, a briefe Presage of his, Who, oft, hath truth foretold: And, it is this. When, here, a Scot shall think his Throne to set Above the Circle of a British King; He shall a datelesse Parliament beget, From whence a dreadfull Armed brood shall spring. That off-spring shall beget a wild confusion; Confusion, shall an Anarchy beget; That Anarchy shall bring forth in conclusion, A Creature, which you have no name for, yet; That Creature, shall conceive a sickly State, Which will an Aristocracie produce: The many headed Beast, not liking that, To raise Democracie, shall rather chuse. And, then Democracies production shall A Moon-calfe be; which some a Mole do call. A false Conception of imperfect nature, And, of a shapelesse, and a bruitish feature. All these Descents, shall live, and raigne together; So acting for a while, that few shall know Which of them gets the Sov'raignty; or whether There be among them, a Supreme, or no. When they with jarres and janglings have defac'd Your triple-building, and themselves nigh worne, Into contempt; they, of one cup shall tast; And, into iheir first elements returne: Five of them, shall subdue the other five; And, then those five, shall by a doubtfull strife, Each others death so happily centrive, That, they shall die, to live a better life: And, out of their corruption, rise there shall A true Supreme, acknowledged by all. In which the pow'r of all the five shall bee With Unity made visible in three. Prince, People, Parl'ament, with Priests and Peers, Shall be, a while, your emulous Grandees; Make a confused Pentarchie, some years, And, leave off their distinct claimes, by degrees: And, then shal Rigteousnesse ascend the Throne; Then, love, and truth, and peace re-enter shall: Then, faith, and reason, shall agree in one; And all the Vertues to their counsell call. Then, timely out of all these shall arise, That Kingdome, and that happy Government, Which is the scope of all those Prophecies, That future Truths obscurely represent: But how this will be done, few men shall see; For wrought in clouds and darknesse, it will bee: And, ere it comes to passe, in publike view, Most of these following signes will first ensue. A King, shall willingly himself unking; And, thereby grow far greater then before. The Priests their Priesthood, to contempt shall bring; And Piety shall thereby thrive the more. A Parliament, it selfe shall overthrow; And thereby, shall a better being gaine; The Peers, by setting of themselves below, A more innobling honour shall obtaine: The people for a time shall be inslav'd; And, that shall make them for the future free. By private losse, the publike shall be sav'd; An Army shall by yeelding Victor bee. The Cities wealth her poverty shall cause: The Lawes corruption, shall reform the Lawes: And, Bullocks, of the largest Northern breed, Shall fatted be, where now scarce sheep can feed. You may perhaps, deride what's here recited, As, heretofore you other Truths have sleighted. But, part of this Presage you have beheld, Already in obscurity, fulfill'd: The rest shall in the time appointed come; And, sooner, then will pleasing be to some. The last nine signes, or symptomes, of the ten, Which must precede it, shall appear to men Of all conditions: But, our Author saith, The first, is but in hope, not yet in Faith; And may be, or not be, for, so, or so, That King, shall have his lot, as he shall do. If all his sins, he heartily repent, God will remit, ev'n all his punishment; And, him, unto his Kingdomes, back restore, With greater honour, then he had before. If he remaine impenitent, like Saul, God, from the Throne, shall cast both him, and all His whole Descent; and, leave him not a man To fill it, though he had a Jonathan. If Ahab-like, his mourning hath respects To temporary losses and effects; Like Ahabs, then it therewithall shall carry, Some benefit, which is but temporary. A reall penitence, though somewhat late, The rigour of his doome may much abate; By leaving him a part of what he had, When he a forfeiture of all hath made: Or else, by rooting out those, who in sin With him, have actually partakers been; And, planting in their steads, a Branch of his, Whose Innocency no way question'd is. For, this hath oft, with good successe been done In Ages past; not in this Jsle alone, But, in most other Kingdomes: And, if you Will in GOD's Chronicles but take a view, Of his proceedings; you, in them will see, For what it is that Princes changed bee: Why some lose but a part; why some lose all; Why, for a time; why, some for ever fall: Why, some shall but for three descents remaine; And, how they might have had a longer raigne: When war, when pestilence, when dearth, will come Upon a land; when GOD will take it from That land againe; and, how, they may fore-know, When, he will bring a totall overthrow. They, who have learn'd to contemplate aright Those old records, may gaine a true fore-sight Of many things, whereby to regulate Enormities, both in the Church, Ind State; Things to themselves pertaining; to their friends, Their Foes, their Policies, their Fates, their ends: And, if this were not so; what, are to you, The stories of the Kingdomes of the Jew, Or, of their friends, and foes, more usefull than Those, which concern the realmes of Powhatan? Or, so available, as those relations, Which memorize the deeds of your own nations? But all this is but words; there must be deeds, Ere to perfection any things proceeds: You must not everlastingly be stating The Question; or, be seven yeares more debating: For, ere that time, things will too late be done; Which many fear, will come to passe too soone. Expect you, some third persons, should between The King and you, at this time intervene To make attonement? Pray, who should they bee? Who, wisheth you so well? who, doth not see, That, all, 'twixt whom, and you, there be relations, Them qualifying for such mediations, May get more, by your wo, then by your weale? Who knowes not, how with Friends most Friends now deal? And, who perceives not, that those Mediators Have interests, and, many weighty matters, Pertaining to themselves, which they'l begin On such a faire occasion, to hedge in? And, thereby paradventure they may brign Great disadvantages, upon the King, Or, on the Kingdomes: and perhaps on both, Which to indanger, wisemen would be loth? What then can be effected? or by whom, May our desires, now feiseable become? Since, there is no way open for accesse, Nor any meanes admitted for addresse? The Parliament, conceives it selfe abus'd, In that, their offers have been oft refus'd; And, seems resolv'd, that they will never more Send Messages in vaine, as heretofore: And though the King, were now as penitent, As David and Manasseh, with intent, Unfainedly to satisfie, and do What ever justice doth oblige him to; VVhat ever, you in reason could require, To answer, at the full your owne desire; Or, whatsoe're affections mortifi'd, A contrite heart, or conscience rectifi'd, Should urge him to: yet, now, there is no way, Whereby, this may be manifest, you say. Despair not friends: mind what I said before; True penitence, will find, or make a doore: Though, it be treason voted, now to bring Or, carry Message, to or from the King: Although his person be retain'd in ward; Attended alwaies, with an armed Guard: Although strong walls have round inclosed him: Though rocks far stronger, have surrounded them; Yea, though the rageing, and the roaring seas, Have also, like a mote, incircled these: Through all these difficulties, I could find Conveyances, if thereto he had mind, To publish his repentance; and prevaile, If to performe his part, he should not faile. Yea, find him meanes, without an obligation To any party, or to any Nation, Or any, but himselfe; to make his peace, With honour: and his Kingdomes to possesse. Now, let him neither heed, nor harken to What other men do say, or what they do; For, whatsoever they shall act, or prattle, (Will be to him, but, fruitlesse tittle tattle) But, let him sit downe, by himselfe alone; And, set down (as, he reads, it hath been done By King Manasseh) most unfain'd confessions Of all his knowne offences, and transgressions; Acknowledge GOD's just dealing in afflicting; His Providence, and mercie, in correcting So like a Father; and, for his attending So long time, for repentance and amending. Let him expresse a resolute intent, To leave to GOD's dispose, the government Which he hath mannag'd ill; and to resigne Himselfe, and his, to providence divine, With full assurance, of obtaining place, In his free love, and alsufficient grace. This done; let him, subscribe the same, and spread it, Before the LORD; let him with such teares read it, As may declare, it was his act and deed: Then, seale it, with a Heart, which much doth bleed; And, with a Lion rampant, so reverst, That, none may fear, his rage or bloody thirst. Upon which acts, by meanes of your relation, And, by that spirit of Communication, Whereby, most secret actions, are made knowne, (When to good purposes they may be showne) Ev'n at that point of time, they, who have bin His opposites, will feel, some creeping in, First, hopes; then Good opinions; and at last, That which will blot out all Offences past; And make them kill their fat calfe; daunce and sing; That, they, have found again their long lost King. Oh, that I could behold that happy day Of penitence; and, that behold I may Both Parliament, and People meet therein So truely; that, their unrepentant sinne May not, when God hath re-inthroned him, Prolong their woes, or bring new plagues on them. But, whom am I, that, either you, or he, Should on my word rely, or take from me Those things which I have said? know, I am that Which is your GENIUS cal'd. If, you ask what A GENIUS is, I will define the same, According to the nature, and the name. So cal'd it is, because, it doth incline With an affection truely Genuine, To draw to good, and to withdraw from ill, Those Persons, both in action and in will, To whom it doth relate; and from disgraces, And spoile, to keep such Persons, and such places. A GENIUS, is an incorporeall creature, Consisting of an intellectuall nature; Which at the selfe-same time, a being had, With that, for whose well-being it was made. And, may be cal'd, that Angell, which designeth, Adviseth, moveth, draweth and inclineth To happinesse; and, naturally restraineth From harme, that creature, whereto it pertaineth: And, this am I to you. Then have a care, My counsells now, with good respect to heare: For, they, to whom their GENIUS represents, That which to safety tends, and harme prevents; If, then, he shall his good advise neglect, And, passe it by, with willfull disrespect; They shall deservedly, be left to those: Ill Angells, whose direction, they have chose And, what will then succeed, they shall perceive When 'tis too late, their evill choise to leave. Then looking back, he fixt his eyes on me, And, said; my Secretary thou shalt be To Register, and publish to these Nations, What counsells, warnings, and what exhortations God hath vouchsaf'd them; that what ere betide, His Grace, or Justice may be glorifi'd. This being said, my FANCY rose, and drew A Curtaine; wherewith quite beyond my view, This apparition vanish'd. And, I took My pen, to put in writing, what was spoke, And publish it to others, that it may Prevent (if possible) your evill day: For, till amendment, or destruction come, The Beasts would preach, should men continue dumb: Yea, what their Genius, now to them doth speake If they should sleight it, stones would silence breake, To rouze them from their slumbers; or, to tell Succeeding-Ages, how and why they fell. When all was vanish'd, and, I left alone, Intending, what was willed to be done, A feare surpriz'd me; and, a shuddring took me, Which with a long continuing trembling strook me; And my weak heart began to be afraid, To doe what I resolv'd; and, thus it said. Observ'st thou not the madnesse of this Nation, The rage and fury of this Generation? And, how like Swine, before whom Pearles are throwne, They tread the givers of good counsell downe, And, teare them into peices, by their scornes; Because they then expected Barley-cornes? For ten to one, ev'n some in whose defence, These truths are spoke, will want intelligence To understand them so; and foolishly Charge thee with sland'ring that Authority Which thou dost honour; and, which (as this day Things go) can saved be no other way. Hast thou nigh forty years been vext and grieved, By this dull Generation, unrelieved? And having for it, ventured thy life, Undone thy little children, and thy wife, Left them nor house, nor lands, nor cloaths, nor bread, Nor ought wherewith they may be comforted, (In that contagious sicknesse, which this day, Hath driven all thy comforters away) Yea, spent all in their service; and wilt thou Having obtained words and paper now, Which promise restauration, hazzard all Those hopes, by that, which hereby may befall? Hast thou full five years toyl'd and tired been To struggle from the mischiefs thou wert in; With much-much difficulty, got at last Acknowledgments of what forborn thou hast? And, probability, that thou perchance Maist get one half, by giving, for advance The other moiety? And, meanest thou To lose it all again, by doing now What this Illusion doth intice thee to? And everlastingly thy self undo? For nothing spoken for the publike good, Will to thy benefit be understood, By such as hate thee: And, thou well dost know That thou maist more be mischiev'd by one Foe (Who to the publike faithfulnesse pretends) Then benefited by a hundred friends. Take heed of this temptation; thou hast done Thy share this way. Now let the world alone: Provide for thine owne safety and thine ease: As others do, write those things that may please: And thou shalt then be freed from those disgraces, That thou hast suffred: there will then, be places For thee, aswell as others: and thou then Shalt favour'd be, as much as other men. Thy peace is made already; not a tongue Doth move against thee; And, thou shalt ere long Of all thy dues be fully repossest, If thou wilt let the world do what she list. When thus, my owne corruptions from within me, Had spoke, from my good purposes to win me: Another Voice, as coming from behind me, Thus whispred: SON of EARTH, give ear &amp; mind me. Resist thou that suggession; let it be But as a Serpent on a stone, to thee, Which finds no entrance: For, it is the seed Of that old Serpent, whereof to take heed Thou hast good cause; since, if his head prevaile To enter, he will slip in to the taile. And thou a poore flea-biting to avoid, Maist with the stings of Vipers be destroy'd. Feare not those Bug-beares wherewith fooles are frighted; Nor prize those toyes wherewith such are delighted; Fear not the cruell Tyrants of the times; Nor tast their dainties lest thou act their crimes. Feare not thy Family shall be unfed; For, he that gave them mouthes, will give them bread. He that alreadie hath five years maintain'd thee, (Since thou hadst nought left likely to maintaine thee Five months) and kept thee all that while afloat In storms, though thou hadst neither Oar nor boat; He can aswell preserve thee now, as then, With nothing: therefore, seek to him agen. Think not thy selfe alone, or without friends; For thousands favour what thy Muse intends: The well-affected Members of each House, Yea, all among them, who are generous, Will favour thy endeavours; and, be glad, That, in these times, an English-man they had, Whom neither hopes, nor fears, could make affraid To speake, what he thought pertinently said For publike safety; whatsoere he lost: Or, whose designe soere was thereby crost. He, that in times past, did secure thee from Thy foes; will do the same in time to come: For, that thou maist believe he will do so, Already five successions, in a row He hath destroy'd; who, causlessely had sought Thy ruine, Some, of them, (who, lately brought A mischiefe on themselves) now rooted bee From dwelling, where they persecuted thee: The sixth is also ripening to be sent To follow them, unlesse they shall repent. They, whom thou fear'st, if thou shalt constant be In good resolves, will be afraid of thee; For, GOD shall put the feare of thee on those Who to thy principles, and waies, are Foes; Or else, at least, they shall still slumber on; And, let thee speake in vain, as they have done. Discourage not thy selfe, as if thy paine In these indeavours would be quite in vaine; For, GOD will make thy weary Pilgrimage Bring some advantage to this present age, Or to the next. To this work thou wert borne; And, when thou to thy Fathers dost returne, It shall not grieve thee, that thou hast bestowne, More time for publike good, then for thine owne. Thy Faculties were not confer'd on thee For no Imployment; nor imployd to bee In flattering fools: nor, as at first it was, To praise the fading beauties of a face: Or, play with those affections, which infuse The vaine expressions, that pollute a Muse; But, to provoke to vertue: to deter From vice, all chast affections to prefer; GODS Judgements to declare; his righteousnesse To magnifie; his mercies to confesse: And, whilst thou to this purpose art imploy'd, Fear not to be undone, or be destroy'd: For, by undoing, thou shalt be new-made; By thy destruction, safety shall be had: And, if this Generation shall pursue Thy love with hatred; or with-hold thy due; It shall be one addition to their doome, To be the scorn of ev'ry Age to come. This reconfirm'd my Spirit; and I found My heart with fearlesse courage, to abound. With resolutions, I was fortifi'd; And, throwing all my owne affaires aside, Which most concernd me; I, to write begun What I had heard: and, now, the worke is done, My Conscience is discharg'd; my heart is eas'd; And, therein come what will, I shall be pleas'd. Terræ Filius. To the Parliaments. It is not feare, in me; nor it is shame, Which makes me, at this time, conceal my name: But, humble modestie, and consciousnesse, Of that knowne frailty, and unworthinesse, Wherewith my Person, outwardly is cloth'd, Oft, makes my selfe, ev'n of my selfe so loth'd, That (not without good reason,) I suspect My purposes, may find the lesse effect, If, ere you tast the fruit, I let you know, In whose poor Garden, GOD, hath made it grow, For, many times, the best wine pleaseth not, Unlesse, we like the Drawer, and the Pot. A homebred Simples vertue, few will owne; A Doctor seemes best skil'd, that is unknowne: Yea, miracles, by Christ, were seldome done, Where, he reputed was, but Josephs son. How ere it please, or may be understood, I dare aver, my purposes were good; And, that, hereby, you have advantages To do your selves an honour, if you please. Therewith, you profit, likewise, may receive, If, thereunto, but those respects you give, Which are, in equity, to those things due, That will both profit, and much honour you. GODS will be done: and, if your will agree With his, then, let your will be done on mee. Aliquid ex improviso The Author will not, now, this Poem send Unto the King; because it may offend. But, if to give it, he had lawfull way, He downe would kneel; and, thus would humbly say. Dear Sir, be pleased to peruse this Book. With undistempred, heart, and gracious look; And, though some Passages, may harsh appear, Read out with patience, what is written here: For, as with you, and your affaires it stands, My due allegeance, strictly me commands, That, I should plainely deal, and boldly do, What, my well meaning heart did prompt me to: And I have hope, you shall receive by me, A wholsome Pill, although it bitter be. I could not slatter, when you were at height: Nor would I to your sufferings, add the weight Of halfe a graine, (to purchase my own health, Though I were sick) for all your former wealth. So tender am I, and so much afraid, To lay on more, where GOD enough hath laid; Till I may be assur'd, that you contemn His mercies; and proceed, in spight of him. And, I, had now been pleas'd, with words more calme, To have exprest my mind; and with soft balme, To have anointed you; but that thereby, Some (who, it may be, have an evill eye) Might find occasion to obstruct that cure, Which, by this course, may speedy be, and sure. Your wisedome findes my meaning, if your heart Hath any sympathizing with my art; And, I shall soon perceive it, when I know What countenance you hereupon bestow. If I discover not an operation, According to my honest expectation, I shall desist. But, if respect you give To my intent, in this sharp Corrosive; I shall endeavour, to provide a dos, That may close up your wounds, repair your losse; And, give you good assurance, in the end, That, he who seem'd your foe, hath been your friend: Yea dares be so; if you dare be your owne, Though, ten times more affliction, prest you down; And act for you, as far as he is able, His part, of Mouse and Lion, in the Fable; Though both his foes, and yours stood looking on him, And, threatned all the spight that could be done him: For, with a Theefe, that Penitent shall be, A Crucifying, undergo would he, Much rather, then enjoy his preservation, With Barabbas, by publike acclamation. Quæ nocent, docent; BUT, Ex nihilo nihil fit. FINIS. Faults escaped. Some faults, have been commited by the Printer; Some, have escap'd the Author, peradventure: The first, correct your selves, as you shall find them; The last passe by, as if you did not mind them, Forgiving, as of him, you are forgiven; So, we shall all be friends, and reck'nings even. Salt upon Salt: Made out of certain INGENIOUS VERSES Upon the Late STORM And the Death of His HIGHNESS Ensuing. By which Contemplative Object, Occasion is taken, to offer to Consideration the probable neer approaching of greater Storms, and more sad Consequences. By Geo. Wither, Esquire. SALT seasons all things, saving onely those Which must feed Fishes, Maggots, Dogs and Crows. Read it, and heed it, For you need it; And so, God speed it. To the READER. Occasion from a trifling Object springs, Once more, to offer heed of serious Things, For, by perusing some late printed Rimes, That, which may much concern the present Times, Was tender'd to my Thought; and what to me Was offer'd, shall to you now offer'd be. When I began to know the World, and Men, I made Records of what I found them then, Continuing ever since, to take good heed, How they stood still, went back, or did proceed, Till of my Scale of Time, ascending Heav'n, The Round I stand on, maketh ten times Seven; And, being likely, now, ere long to leave them, A Memorandum, I intend to give them, Of what, this day, they do appear to me, As also, what they may hereafter be; (According as they shall direct their Course) That, whether they are better grown, or worse, It may be to GOD's Honour seen and read, (What ere befals) when they and I, am dead. When in this Isle my Muses first were known, The heads of VICE were not so Monstrous grown, (Nor then so numerous) as now they be; For, Cerberus in those dayes had but three, And Hydra seven: At present, they are more In Number, and more Large, then heretofore: So that these Monsters, for whose overthrow I was ingag'd, nigh fifty yeers ago, Are grown so formidable, that, they make The Fortresses of Moral Vertue shake, And, yield at present, work enough to do, For Hercules, and Mighty Sampson too. Yet I have lost no Ground, but kept the Field; And will, till I have Conquer'd, or am Kild: For, though some daily fall off, who pretended Adherence to the Cause which we defended, (And though my Elder Brethren do but flout me) I find an Unseen Army, pitch'd about me, Which takes my Part, and will effect at length, That, which is far beyond my single strength: And, he, who dies, in making good his Place, Though he prevails not, dies without Disgrace. The List, I enter not, with guileful Charms, Of Humane Eloquence, nor with such Arms Defensive, or offensive, as were brought By them, who have of late, our Battails fought; But onely with a Sling, Stones, and a Staff, At which my Friends jeer, and my Foes do laugh; Yet (mark the Sequel) for, a day will come, That shall place Justice in the highest Room; That, they who by their Brethren were envide, (Or by their Masters wronged) shall be tride; That those Poor People, who oppressed be, In Body, or in Conscience, shall be free; And, that, though this be scorn'd, it shall be sed Whilst I am Living, or, when I am Dead, That, by those, now-contemned Pebble-stones, Which I have flung, there will be Broken-Bones, And Bruised Braines, which did to some of those Prove Mortal, who have been my Countries Foes. Mean while, I'll prosecute what I intend, Not much regarding what a Foe, or Friend, Shall either Counter-act, or Counter-say, But, bear their Spights, and Censures as I may. Nor to my Theam will I so close be tide, As not, sometimes, to make a step aside, To take in that, which may conduce unto The Work, which I in chief, intend to do; But, act as my INSPIRER, moveth me: For, I'm by Him inspir'd, not He by Me. And therefore, here, before I take my leave, I'll warn you, (lest your thoughts I may deceive) That Method not to look for, which by those Is used, who express their Mindes in Prose; For, Things, not in pre-meditated Thought, (To me upon a sudden, being brought) I took in, as they came; and what they were Oft knew not, till in Words, they did appear: Which having signifi'd, you may thereby Guess, what to judge of them, as well, as I; And, whether, that should not your hearts incline To think, there's somewhat in them more then Mine. Last Year, I sent a FLASH, which is let pass, Unheeded, as a Thing that never was: Now follows the Report, or Clap of Thunder, Which have been seen and heard, thus far asunder, To give the longer Warning; for the SHOT And THUNDER-BOLTS, (if Grace prevent them not) Will next year fly among you: GOD amend us, And, then, I am assur'd, He will defend us. Your Servant and Remembrancer, GEORGE WITHER. SALT upon SALT: Made out of certain ingenious Verses upon the late Storm, and the Death of His Highness ensuing; by which Contemplative Object, occasion is taken to offer to consideration the probable neer approaching of greater Storms, and more sad Consequences. The said Verses are these that next follow, according to the Author's printed Copy. We must resign; heav'n his great Soul doth claim, In Storms as loud as his Immortal Fame; His dying Groans, his last Breath shakes our Isle, And, Trees uncut, fall for his Funeral-Pile; About his Palace, their broad Roots are tost Into the Air; so, Romulus was lost; So, New-Rome, in a Tempest, mist her King, And from obeying, fell to worshipping. On Oeta's top, thus Hercules lay dead, With ruin'd Oaks, and Pines about him spread: Those, his last Furie, from the Mountain rent, Our dying Hero, from the Continent Ravish'd whole Towns, and Forts from Spaniards reft, As his last Legacy to Britain left. The Ocean, which our Hopes had long confin'd, Could give no Limits to his Vaster Minde. Our Bounds inlargement was his latest toil, Nor hath he left us pris'ners to this Isle; Under the Tropick, is, our Language spoke, And Part of Flanders hath receiv'd our Yoke. From Civil-Broiles, he did us dis-engage, Found Nobler Objects for our Martial Rage, And with wise Conduct, to His Country shew'd Their Antient Way of Conquering abroad. Ungrateful then, if we no tears allow To Him, who gave us Peace, and Empire too. Princes, who fear'd Him, griev'd, concern'd to see No pitch of Glory, from the Grave is free: Nature herself, took notice of His Death, And, sighing, swel'd the Sea, with such a Breath, That, to remotest shoars, her Billows rowl'd, Th'approaching Fate of her great Ruler told. The Result, occasioned by the preceding Theam. Away with self-respects; For now of late My Private, and this Publick Weals Estate Are much alike; and both of them, to me Seem in their Crisis, at this day to be, Threatning a Sudden Ruine, if much further Confusion spreads, before reduc'd to Order. My Genius therefore, doth my Heart incline To seek that Weal, whereon dependeth mine, Lest, whilst for Private welfare, I endeavor, That, and the Publick Peace, be lost for ever. This to prevent, (though some will think I dream) There is occasion couched in this Theam: And (notwithstanding, much it may be fear'd, That, what it shall produce, will not be heard, Among the tumults and confusedness Which now abound) it will have some Success: For, otherwhile, by Trifles, that is wrought, Which could not by great Powers, to pass be brought. A small shrill whistle, in a Storm, becoms More signal then the beating of great Drums: And, who knows not, (he breathing thereinto) What, by a Ramshorn Trumpet, GOD, may do? Our late loss, doth on me to call begin, As if I somewhat were concern'd therein, And had a part to Act, wherein I may Supply, at least, a Fools part in the Play. And, since occasion given there is none, I, of my own accord have taken one, Which, if a causless anger, it provoke To mischieve me, the care's already took; I am too low a mark for Supreme Pow'rs, Too high, to dread an equal when he low'rs. The main prop, of this Government is gone, The Stone, our Master-builders built upon Is now remov'd; and, either I mistake, Or, all that's built thereon begins to shake, And quite asunder too, will fall at length, Unless upheld, with more then humane strength. No former Prince, whose Actions yeelded matter So worthy of a Muse that would not flatter, Di'd at a time, wherein there liv'd so few To give him that, which justly was his due, (Without a diminution or excess, Either of which, makes great things, to seem less) For, having view'd most paper-monuments, Whereby the Fancie of this Age presents His Fame to memorie; I finde their Rimes Are so distracted, as if with these times Their Authors sympathized in their wit, And knew not what they meant, nor what they writ: Else, doubtless, none had fail'd so in expressing His purpose, as to curse, instead of blessing; As he, whose Poëm-elegiacal Is clos'd up, with the name of Jerubbaal. Some, so malitiously Invectives write, As if their Pens, in Juice of Aconite Were dipt (or rather in more venom'd matter) So opposite to that, which they who flatter Hide underneath their tongues, that, in the stead Of shewing hatred only to the dead, They, living men impoyson through the ear When their uncharitable Charms they hear: For, these have not alone in scurrile Verse, Blur'd him with what their malice could asperse True, or untrue; but, also, take GOD's roome, Dare to pronounce his everlasting Doome; And, wickedly, with Damned souls in Hell, (As others do with Saints) him parallel: Which argues an Intention, to defame The person, though he merited no blame. Some others, on that subject wantonize As if their Muse were hawking Butterflies: Some, are all Oyl: some, have but this one fault, The want of Sulphur, Mercurie, and Salt: And, few of them, save he, whose lines preceding, I make my Text, afford ought worth the reading: And, they now put me into such a fit That, if I have not much more Grace then wit, It may to harsher Censures me expose Then any one of them, yet undergoes. Except Obscene Verse, (and strong lines, from whence Are hardly screw'd intelligible sense) Strains like to this, these Times, best prize to praise; And, 'tis a smart neat Peece, ??????? sayes: Which, I deny not; for, it mounts as high As any English Pegasus can flie, And, is as well-pac'd: But he feels the Reins Lie loose upon his Crest, and overstrains, To know, what best the season doth befit With his own Ends, this Author wants not wit, And, I believe, takes much more care then I, What will best please, and wherewith to complie; Though I, have more then forty years and five Found, that my Course, is not the Course to thrive. These Verses, which to make my Theam I chuse Are but the sportings, of their Authors Muse, And seem to me like Knacks which in a Hall, I've seen hung up, for Flies to play withall. These are Wits bubbles, blown up with a Quill, Which watrie-Circles, with weak-Air doth fill; Or, like a squib, which fires, and cracks, and flies, And, makes a noise, that little signifies. I, envie not his Fame, who is deceast, Nor ought, whereby, it may be more encreast: I, never suffred ought by his Displeasure; But, did enjoy his Favour, in some measure, Which he knows, unto whom all things are known, I, more employ'd for his weal, then mine own, And, disadvantaged my self, to do him Such services, as, I thought, I did owe him. For these respects, none justly can suppose I grudge him ought, which may by Verse or Prose, Be added to his Fame; or, that the Mome I'll play, by carping, or detracting from Another's contributions, if I see They are in truth, what they may seem to be. I, should be pleas'd that those Lines, which precede, (With what else doth relate to him that's dead) Whereby, some think, he may be honor'd much, To all who hear, or view them, might prove such, That, no occasion might from them be took, Of what, to his dishonour, will be spoke; Or, to encrease those Vanities which are Already, multiplied, over far. I, therefore, now expect to be excus'd Although at this time, I have nothing mus'd, That, may concern him, in the common mode; For, in that place, he, now hath his abode Where he regards not Bawbles. Praises, there, Or Flatteries, no whit regarded are; The most inchanting Charms, there, cannot charm him: Detractions, or Invectives cannot harm him; To write those Truths, which might have done him shame Whilst here he liv'd; or gain'd the Writer blame, Ought, now to be declar'd as well as those From whence his highest commendation flowes; And, that may settle Peace, now being spoken, Which in his life-time, might the Peace have broken. The sacred-Pen-men, future times acquaints, Not only with the merits of the Saints, But also, with their Failings; and as great By th'one, as th'other, is mans benefit: For, which respect, I will not be afrayd: To speak, what to good purpose, may be sayd; Nor, from my Text (as now) to wheel about To fetch in that, which others needless thought; For, Method, is not so much my intent, As by good means, a mischief, to prevent: And, my digressions, may advance my end, As much as that, which I did first intend. 'Tis now, high time, for us to spend our hours, In gath'ring Fruits, and not in picking Flow's. I love to see truth, in her nakedness; And, that, she should sometimes, put on a Dress, With such Poetick Flourishes adorn'd, That safe may keep her, and from being scorn'd; To which end, I my self, compell'd have been To mask and vail her, when I have foreseen Apparent Dangers; and another time To cloath her, in that fashionable Trim Which most affect; that, therewith brought acquainted, True Beauty, may be known from what is painted. And, that, they who were drawn in, by the Signe, Might Guests be, for the goodness of the Wine. My Reverence to the Muses, is not small; For, all true Poets are Prophetical, And had a Preparation in the Womb, Before they forth into the World did come; Not, that their Faculty, should be appli'd To stir up Carnal Lust, or puff up Pride; But, that they should to Pietie invite, And make Mankinde in Virtues more delight; From which, prevaricating, they have lost Their Honour; and are quite despis'd almost. They should not strive for words to please the ear, In which, no solid Matter doth appear; But, write so plainly, that, the meanest Wit Might from their Musings, reap some benefit. They should not weave their Webs of Stuffs that be So, diff'ring, that, they never can agree; Nor, when our Sin, for Sober-Mourning calls, Play us a Jigg, or sing us Madrigals. Meer verbal Whimseys, in a Serious Cause, Which most part of the Readers more amaze Then edifie; (by that which never was, Nor is, nor shall hereafter come to pass) Look like solemnizing an Ordinance In Pious Duties, with a Morrice-Dance; Or, like their actings, who, against the Forces Of well-arm'd Foes, bring Troops of Hobby-horses. What, in the Theam foregoing, is there said Which honours him deceased, if well weigh'd? And hath not rather into question brought Things, which to question, few men would have thought? There, at his Death, a Storm, is fain'd to roar, Which was o'er-blown almost a week before; And, had it not been so, some would from thence Have drawn, perhaps, an evil Consequence; More Fancies, forming in the People's Brain, Then two such Storms, would have blown out again. Allusions, too, are made, as if surmiz'd That, He, henceforth should be Idolatriz'd, As more then Man, whom we this day perceive Laid lower then the meanest Men that Live. To teach us, that, in Princes, there's no trust; That, all meer Human-Glories, are but dust; And, that, Death will, their Vanity discover, At whatsoe'er cost, Double-Guilded over. So, did His last Breath shake this Isle of our, As Pellets from a Pot-Gun, shake a Tow'r. For, all her Shakings, to my best perceiving, Rise from our own Distempers who are Living. So, for his Funeral-Pile, un-cut Trees fell; So, Romulus and He were Parallel; So, New-Rome, in a Tempest, mist her King, Then, from obeying, fell to worshipping; And, so, on Oeta, Hercules lay dead, As Chalk's like Cheese, and Beer is like to Bread. So, from the Continent, He Towns hath torn, As he, who tears a Hedge, and gets a Thorn Which wounds his hand, and when he dreads no harm, Doth gangrene, to the losing of his Arm. So, are our Freedoms, and our Bounds inlarg'd, As his, who, from a small Debt, is discharg'd, To re-oblige himself, in that, which may Sweep Liberty, and all he hath, away; And, if our Endings prove like our Beginnings, Our Losses, vvill be greater then our Winnings. What Comfort yields it, to impose a Yoke On others, if our Fetters be not broke? VVhat Pleasure brings it, if our Confines be Inlarged, if in them, vve are not free? VVhat Profit, is it unto us at Home, That some in Forraign Parts, inrich'd become, If, vve mean vvhile are Beggars? or else more At least, impov'rish'd, then we vvere before? VVhat Honour is it, that, both Tropicks hear Our Language, if to speak Truth, few men dare? Or vvhat by Conquests, vvill be got or sav'd, If they vvho Conquer'd, are at last inslav'd? Not unto us, not unto us, be given, (Or to our Chiefs) but to the GOD of Heaven, The thanks and honour, that, both our Late Wars VVith Neighb'ring Foes, and our Domestick Jarrs Are Superseded: VVould GOD, I could say, VVere vvholly ended: (as I hope I may) For, had not He, with our Protector stood, VVe, till this day, had wallow'd in our Blood; Yea, had not GOD, a timely ayd brought in, Destroy'd long since, both He, and vve had bin. Our Antient Way of Conquering abroad, VVhich this Muse, doth implicitely applaud) VVhat got vve by it, but a Cursed Game, Atchiev'd vvith Blood, and lost vvith Blood again? I know not vvhat the Conscience of a State Or Policy by Law, may tolerate; VVith that I vvill not meddle: But to me It seemeth not to Quadrate or agree VVith Moral Honesty, or Sacred Laws, (Unless there be unquestionable Cause, And Pow'r apparent, vvhich doth vvarrantize GOD's calling us to such an Enterprize) That, vve, into our Neighbours Lot, should fall VVith Fire and Sword; and Honourable call Those Deeds, for vvhich, LAVV, to their Actors gives The stiles of Pyrats, Murtherers and Thieves: Or, that, a few, should vvithout free assent Of all the People in a Parliament, Ingage them by a Quarrel, which may cost Their Lives, and all that may vvith Life be lost: I know no Law or Gospel, vvarranting So hazzardous or reasonless a thing; Or, that, vve vvho subjection do profess Unto the King of Righteousness and Peace, Should take the Wages, and the Colours carry Of him, that's both His and our Adversary. Nor can I understand, how vve then do As we would willingly be done unto, VVhen to accomplish the ambitious ends Of Princes, vve have hazzarded our Friends, To trouble, and infringe the Peace of those, VVho vvould not vvillingly have been our Foes; Till many hundred thousands are undone, To satisfie the boundless Lust of One; Squandring away those Blessings to th'increase Of Discord, which we might have kept in Peace. How many a goodly City, Town and Field, VVhich did a comfortable Dwelling yeild To Millions, who were no way interested In Tyrants Quarrels, have of late been wasted? And, what a sad Accompt to make have they Upon whose heads, that Blood and Spoil doth lie? Believe it; though to keep from Violation Those Laws, which have respect to every Nation, GOD's Universal Justice, doth engage The Nations on each other, War to wage; Yet, use they should not make of His Commissions To satisfie their Vengeance, their Ambitions, Or Avarice; nor any vvay extend them Beyond those Ends for which he doth intend them. It is but little less then Blasphemy The Works of Nature, so to mis-apply As this Muse doth, who in a Strain doth write, As if none could express a Glow-Worm's light Unless he did Hyperbolize, so far, At least, to equalize it to a Star. He seems, as if he would insinuate That Nature, at his Death was passionate; And makes that Creature speak, which never Flatters Or Speaks at all, save onely in such Matters, As do concern GOD's glory, or, may shame Those Wits who grossly mis-apply the same. So, Nature, hath took Notice of His Death, And, sighing, swel'd the Ocean with her breath, The Death of her great Ruler to foreshew, As 'twas presaged when my Cat did Mew: For, Nature, never heed in such wise, took Of any Princes Death, but, when it shook The Universe, to see the SON OF GOD Dead on the Cross, with Arms display'd abroad: And from the Reverence that's due to such High Mysteries, this, hath detracted much. Of this kinde, and of such-like Airy-Puffs, Of such deceivable, vain, empty stuffs, Are most of all those Books, and Trophies made, Which Princes, to eternize them have had: And, so small credit, is attributed To what is either to their Honour sed, Or their Dishonour, that, wise Men reject it, As of no Value; or at least, suspect it, As an effect of Flatterie, or of Hate, Though many set it at a higher Rate. For, their Praise, whom we finde most prodigal Of Praises, merits no respect at all; But, rather, from the Hearers, back returns On him that's Prais'd, and on the Praiser, Scornes: And, seldom, shall you finde much worth in them, That have immodest Praises, in esteem. Yet, these vain Blasts of Fame, oft, sound as loud As Cannons, or as Thunder from a Cloud: The People entertain them with Applause; Of much Expense, they are the needless Cause: By these, wise Men, are otherwhile bewitch'd; By these, are Fools and Flatterers inrich'd: But, thereby, such effects alone are got, As Powder hath, when fired without shot. Yet, so to prize them, many men are given, As if, without them, none could climb to Heaven; Or, as if he, of whom most Lies we tell, Should find least Torments, in the Pains of Hell. The Principle I own, is to adhere To that Power, which Supremacy doth bear, And I'll (without an Oath) be true to those VVho are by GOD, and by this People chose, Till they advance another, whom I see Invested with Pow'r-Absolute, to be; And, whether he comes in, by Right or Wrong, Leave that, to them, to whom it doth belong. Him, I will serve, not with base Flatteries VVhich blind his Judgement, or put out his eyes. In my Addresses, I will never tell To him, what I may fear he knowes too well: Nor further then I know him, magnifie him, Lest his own conscience knowing I belie him, (Or speak more then my knowledge can acquire) He, hereby know, I am a fawning Lyar. Before him, I will those things onely set, VVhich I think, he may possibly forget, Or, vvhich unto his knowledge are not brought, Or (if known) not consider'd as they ought; And, do it so, that he shall not despise VVhat's done, if he be either Good, or Wise: If not, yet vvhen my Duty I have done, I'll bear with Patience, vvhat ensues thereon. In all the Changes, vvhich have been of late, I have preserv'd this Rule inviolate, Though some think not, vvhen one Pow'r vvas made two, And, wiser Men, knew not vvhich vvay to go. For, so far as my conscience vvould permit, I serv'd that Pow'r vvhich in the Throne did sit Most visibly; in every change that came, Siding vvith none in changing of the same: And vvhen the Soveraignty, on him vvas plac'd By GOD's permission, vvho enjoy'd it last, I did, accordingly, employ my Force To keep vvhat might be naught, from being worse; Adventuring, sometimes, so far therein, That, to my disadvantage, it hath bin. I, was to him, in all things, alwayes true, VVhich nothing took from his Superiors due. I did so far forth as it would consist VVith GOD's Praise, with the Publick Interest, And his true Honour, do what in me lay All those Obstructions to remove away, VVhich, by disabling him, might heretofore Have made his Dangers, and our Mischieves more. And, though those Services which I could do him Some will deride, they have been useful to him: For, 'tis at present, known, to more then One, Yet living, (and was known to him that's gone) That, in the greatest hazzard he e'er had, I, seas'nably, by Providence was made An Instrument of Safety, when th'intention VVas almost rip'ned, beyond all Prevention. Yea, to prevent them, vvho by his Disgrace, Endeavour'd to destroy the publick Peace: His Actings, too, I praised as I ought, In what, I, them to be Praise-worthy thought, Consider'd in themselves: But, his Desart Left in the main, to Him, who knew his Heart: And knowing it to be GOD's priviledge, (Even his alone) of Secret things to judge, No further ever did, (nor ever will) Of him, or any man, judge well or ill, Since first this Principle to me was known, And by Consideration, made mine own. It is enough, that Princes whilst they live Are borne withal; and that vvhilst they survive VVe hide their failings, that, none might through them That Pow'r, and that Authority contemn By which they Govern: for, a Tyranny, Is somewhat better then an Anarchy. If, I suspect my Prince a vvicked man, To make him better, I'll do what I can; Lest, he that's next be worse: As once by Paul Agrippa courted was, him court, I shall, If, need be: or, vvill flatter him so far As by our Servants, Children flatter'd are, To make them do their Duties: but, not vvo him For my own ends, to that which may undo him: (VVhich I conceive, is such a Pious fraud As GOD allows, and honest men applaud.) In Life, I serv'd him thus; now Dead he lies I'll speak no more of him, then may suffice To make those better, and take better heed VVho shall henceforward, in his Room succeed. Examples, we from Holy-Writ, may take, That of the Dead we nothing ought to speak But, vvhat is true; and that we are as well Oblig'd, their failings as deserts to tell. That, GOD, may have due Praise by every one; That Men, by knowing truly, what is done, In those things, vvhich concern them; (and by whom Their Mischieves, or their Benefits do come) May actuate accordingly, in season, The Dictates of their Conscience, and sound Reason. It vvas not then thought (as now in these times Perhaps, it may be) that, to blaze the crimes Of Eli, David, or Jehosaphat, Or Hezekiah; (though unto the State Some of them had respect) vvas sawciness, Or vvant of Manners, though they did express Both to those times, and future Generations Their Failings, vvith their proper aggravations. And therefore, if a just occasion be, Expect the like plain-dealing novv from me: For to the same End, I vvill do mine Arrants, And make good my Commission, by their Warrants. I, grant it Thanklesness, as he infers, If we for Benefactors have no tears When they are dead: For, I desire we may Their Dues, both to the Dead and Living pay: But, I conceive it more ingratitude, Upon the World, our Fictions to obtrude, And, let that as impertinent pass by, Which GOD permits, or acts, to glorify His Justice, or his mercie, whose neglects Make other things, to want their due effects. GOD, make us grateful for what is bestown, In such wise, that to every one his own We may ascribe, and, not to any give So much, that, of his dues, we him deprive; Nor so much to one man, that, they may be Defrauded, who, deserv'd as well as He. Such Partialities, at first, brought in All Tyrannies: By such, Free-men have bin Enslaved by degrees, and thereunto Our Fawnings add more, then all else can do; And 'tis impossible a means to finde To keep those Free, who have a slavish minde, Or Currish nature; For, the first want courage, And give their Birth-rights, for a Mess of Porrage: The other, must like Bandogs chained be, Else none who live among them, can be free. GOD, grant us grace, so to bewail his Fate, Who is deceast, as to rejoyce in that Which is thereby design'd: and, to take heed We do not complementally proceed In formal mournings, till the Counterfeit Makes us, those Christian mournings to forget Which are now cal'd for; and till we have more True Cause of sorrow then we had before; And, for the Dead, pursue a formal grieving Destructive to the welfare of the Living: Lest, when the Dead, their Dead, in earth shall cloth, One day, become a mourning-day to both. For, to suspect, just cause enough I find Some mischief, for that day would be design'd And acted too, if Vengeance could raise pow'r To do, what might be done at such an hour: As those despights, do questionless assure Which on his Scutcheon and his Portraiture VVere lately acted, if believe we may VVhat seems believ'd, and common Fame doth say. Interments of the Dead, were first intended Lest by them, they who live, might be offended If not remov'd from sight: Therefore, by giving Things to the Dead, belonging to the living, Doth injure both; and neither get, nor give Such honour, as we may perhaps conceive: But are occasions rather of Disgraces And of returning durt in our Faces. So Cynical my humor never was To think, men should be buried like an Ass; Nor shall I Judas-like, be discontent To see a box of pretious Odors spent In burying him; though for a while the Poor May want it; if, their wants it make not more Then they can bear; And, mends be made for that Which they have suff'red ere it be too late. But, I abhor it, when I do behold Walls clothed, and poor men expos'd to cold And nakedness: or at their needless cost Another honour'd whilst their credit's lost VVhich is more worth then Life; and which to save, They many times, their Lives adventur'd have. Small honour, by that Fun'rall-Pomp, is got VVhere they who bear the charge approve it not. To bring a Prince, with glory to his grave, Is not to make his lifeless Image brave; To give as great a reverence thereunto As Pagans, to their Idols, us'd to do, Or, as they, who like worship have appli'd Unto his Image who was crucifi'd. It is not to make Pageants at their cost (VVho think they have too much already lost) VVith those vain Ceremonial Rites attended, VVhereby, the sober-minded are offended; And till Spectators, Jeeringly do say, It is a very costly Puppet-Play. Or, till it gives them cause to be afear'd That, way thereby, to worse things is prepar'd: For, this way, was Idolatry brought in; This way, most Superstitions did begin; And, this way, if GOD let it be pursu'd A little further they will be renew'd Till that day comes, in which, what men endeavor To build up, shall destroyed be for ever. Philip of Spain, the Second (as 'tis sayd) Did, of a Funeral-Pageant, thus arayd, A Patern leave; which is resembled much By this; one circumstance, (and some few such) Excepted, (and for ought that I yet know, That might be privately, performed too.) Those Anti-roomes of State, with Blacks beclad, Through which, men to th'Effigies passage had, And, wherein they were forced to stand bare, Became a property unuseful there: For, Pater-nosters, they should there have sed, And Ave-Maries, for the Soul that's dead, If they that Ceremonie had observed For which those places were at first reserved; And, whereto (though unpractis'd at this day) Such Innovations, will perhaps make way. VVe are already, drawing very nigh To superstitions, and Idolatrie; And, at the Back-door, that is coming in, VVhich at the Fore-door, hath expelled bin. Who, would have thought, that we, who do neglect One of the goodliest Piles of Architect In all the Christian World, because, long since, It seem'd profan'd, by things which gave offence? That we, should raise up Trophies, in its stead, Of Straws and Sticks, and Kexes to the Dead? And with exploded Vanities, defile The Palaces and Temples of this Isle? Who, having seen what zeal expressed was In pulling down of Crosses, painted Glass, Old Altars, Images of Saints and Kings, (And with these, of some inoffensive things) Did then suppose, he should have liv'd to see An Idol, in that place advanc'd to be, Where heretofore, an Altar, and a Rood To be adored by the People stood? Who can believe, that HE, who vilifide Not long ago, the vanitie and pride Of former Princes? That, HE, who had spoke Against the heavie burthens, and the yoak By them impos'd, and was himself the Rod And sword assum'd into the hand of GOD, To root them out? That HE, who but of late, VVhen he dismist the Counsellors of State Sayd to their Sergeant, Take away that Bable; (His Mace at that time, lying on the Table) Should ever of his own accord, think fit Those Trinkets which he sleighted to admit? And, when he down into the Grave descended, Should thither, with more vain pomps be attended Then any English Prince, that heretofore A Soveraign Scepter, in these Islands bore? Oh! times, oh manners! how exceeding vain Is mans Heart, and how giddy, is his Brain? Who thinketh not, that such a Change hath seen, And, heeds what they seem'd who so chang'd have been? But, that, far greater Changes, will appear, If GOD, prevents not, that which we may fear? For that old Leven, which aside was lay'd, Into the lump, is secretly convey'd: And now corruptions, do so over-spread The Body Politick, from foot to head, That swarms of Hornets, and of Butterflies, Produc'd and fed, by new-sprung Vanities, Are like to multiply, till they shall drive The lab'ring Bees, quite out of every Hive. Excuse my zeal, if over-tart I seem In this point; For, from no disgust of him, For whose pretended honour this is done, Nor from malevolence to any one Who did design it, this expression flows; Nor from what Prejudice, may mis-suppose; But, from the Cause that's given of offence, And, what I fear may be the Consequence. What Meteors, Windes, and Tempests do foreshow I know not, neither take much care to know; Because, they rather warn us, to take heed What's doing, then declare what will succeed: But, by our Flatteries, and by other things Which Pride produces; by what daily springs, From our self-seekings; from our Avarices, And, from our many other sordid Vices, This, I am sure's presag'd, that if we run Much farther, in the Course that's yet hel'd on, (And, GOD, our folly to take place permits) We shall ere long run quite out of our wits; And, be at last destroyed all together, By that Storm, which I see approaching hither. But, who am I, that say I do foresee A Storm, that you should credit give to me? How can such things, to me, you say be known? How know you, when the Sun is almost down That, Night will follow? and the Day draw near When you behold the morning-Star appear? Look not on him, who tells what may ensue, But look to that, whereby you may eschew The threatned Plague, which (as God's threatnings all Are for the most part) is conditional. To that intent, your old neglected Friend Amongst you, one Remembrance more, will send To second this, before perceive he shall A MENE TEKEL, written on your Wall, Unless he sees GOD's patience out of date, And all fore-warnings, like to come too late. Mean while, take this that follows: For he knows You look for Signs, of that which he fore-shows; And, these (although they trivial may appear) Are true Fore-tokens of what's drawing near. Black Clouds, are now ascending o're these Lands, Whose Figures do portend some humane hands Promoting that great Storm; But, when abroad It spreads, you will perceive the hand of GOD, Who, by a slow-approaching doth express, He comes to punish, with unwillingness. Each man, who is not wilful, plainly sees, He enters into Judgement, by degrees, To move us to Repentance, that the Doom, But threatned yet, might vanish ere it come. GOD, hath made known unto us, in some measure, By every Element, his just Displeasure: Those things, without which, nothing is enjoy'd, Have of our late Enjoyments much destroy'd. By sudden Fires, our dwellings are consum'd, And, into smoak, our pretious things are fum'd. The Waters, in their Wombs, have swallow'd up No little Portion of the Merchants hope, And, overflowing new, and Antient Bounds, Swept Flocks and Herds out of the lower Grounds. The Air, by Storms and Blastings, Frosts and Snows, Destroy'd our last Crops, in their fairest shows; Yea, after publickly we made Confessions That, GOD, accepting our Humiliations, Had thereupon, vouchsafed pregnant Hopes Of Future Health, and of more Plenteous Crops; Even since that likely hope, we, for our Sin, Depriv'd of that Expectancy have bin. The Earth which bears us, too; for our Offences With-holds her Bounty. Their sweet Influences The Heavens withdraw. Death, when unlook'd for, seizes More oft then formerly, by New-Diseases; And, they, to give Accompt, are call'd upon, Who liv'd, as if accomptable to none. Hereto, the Naturalist, perhaps will say, Such things do happen to us every day, Or, in a short time, either more or less: Which I will grant; but notwithstanding, this He must grant too, that from the Worlds beginning These vvere, and are, the known Rewards of Sinning: That they are also Signes, GOD vvill bring greater And more Afflictions, if we grow not better: That Judgements, (though they be not general) On Families, and Private Persons fall Ev'n day by day: That, we have lately seen Large Vials of GOD's Wrath, powr'd forth have been Upon the stubborn Irish, and the Scot, To warn us what will also be our Lot; And that none should GOD's Patience, therefore slight, Because a long time, He forbears to smite; Or, pass by timely Warnings, when he sends them, Because this way, to us he recommends them: For, this way, they declared were of old, And, this way, they shall now again be told. But, hear me further, and relate I shall Some things, which do not ev'ry year befall; Our ablest Horse, (ev'n those perhaps, wherein More trust reposed was, then should have bin) Die suddenly, and Ditches are bestrow'd With those Bones, whereupon our Gallants rode: Their Stink (as once a Prophet said) ascends, Yet, still, his hand against us, GOD, extends. Those Leggs, likewise, which are our Second-Strength Do reel already, and will sink at length That Body which they bear: the Wings by which We flew from Shoar to Shoar, and were made rich, Begin to flag, and fly not to and fro, With such Success, as they were wont to do. Some, whose new Honours bloomed but last Spring, Fell with the Leaf, to shew, how vain a thing Ambition is, and let them understand VVho flourish yet, their Winter is at hand. Much, of our pretious Life-Blood up is drunk, The Sinews of our Pow'r are crack'd and shrunk; Our Honour, vvith our Publick Faith is lost; Our Private Credits are destroy'd almost: And, hard it is to say, whether the Debtor Or Creditor, is in Condition better. The Parliaments Securities are slighted, And, He, whom they have by their Acts invited To purchase, (and, of paying whose just Dues An Ordinance, and Orders made fair shews) Though, more then ten years, are elapsed since, Gets neither Mony, Land, nor Recompence, Nor hope of Justice; but, Suits, to the wasting Of his Estate, which may be everlasting: And, they, who should, from these Oppressions clear him, Either regard him not, or sit and jeer him; Though both by Law, and Oath, they stand oblig'd To see the Publick Credit dis-engag'd. That which is due to Poor Men, is delay'd Till they have lost it twice, ere 'tis once pay'd. He that hath Lent, till he can lend no more, Is sure to lose all, that he lent before; And, that which to be given, hath been thought, Proves dearer otherwhile, then vvhat we bought. All which things, being rightly understood, Are Signes (if not of much ill) of small good. Should I here mention all Prevarications, Which have been offer'd to my Observations By being fifteen Years together, tide (As by the Leg) near London to reside, They vvould fill up a Volume: and, but that Thousands can vvitness vvhat I might relate, It vvould be thought, I did Untruths aver, And, that, I vvere a shameless slanderer; For, our Abominations have exceeded All Measure, and are more then can be heeded. It can by no true Englishman be born, Without much Indignation, and more scorn, To see Foot-walkers, vvhen on Horse-back set, So much their late Condition to forget, As, superciliously to look on those By whom, out of Obscurity they rose; And when men seek but Justice, and their own, How these, (as if to have an Alms bestown They vvere implor'd) provoke vvith harsh replies The suff'ring-Suppliant, till his Blood doth rise, The Words are spoken, vvhereon doth ensue Another Wrong, because he spoke vvhat's true. Sometimes, from vveek to vveek, from year to year, Suits are defer'd, vvhich they vvith speed should hear; Yet, nothing then effected, but expence, More adding to a former indigence. Both Means and Time, vvhich fully might enable To do their Work; they spend in Bibble-babble, Or needless Complements; and vvill not vvave A Feast or Visit, though it vvere to save A man from Ruine; and when Plaints are long, By long Oppression, they away are flung. Their Suppliants are forc'd to hunt them thorough Their starting-holes, like Rabbets through their Borough. Yet, hardly come to speak with them, before They (as it were) set Purse-Nets, at each door; And then, unless they likewise, get a Hay Pitch'd round about them, they will slip away. That, which is absolutely in their Pow'r, And, might be finished in half an hour, Is made a Business during term of life; And, then, the Suitor dies without relief: For, Suppliants are oft defer'd so long, That, they at last, vvho should redress the Wrong Are puzzel'd too; and such as have been griev'd So num'rous grow, that few can be reliev'd. No marvail; for the Body-Politick In every part almost, is Lame or Sick; So, that, those Limbs, which in themselves are able, Are render'd by the rest unserviceable; For, though the Foot be whole, it cannot go Because, the Great Gout, lames the greatest Toe. And, very mean performances are found Where, in both Hands, there's but one finger sound. If, it objected be, that such Delayes May justly be occasion'd many vvayes; 'Tis granted, that, it may be so in some; But not till twice seven years elaps'd become, Without apparent wrong: And, that abuses Are this way offer'd, for which no excuses May be allow'd, some thousands living are, VVho, if need be, thereof can vvitness bear. VVhen Publick-Debts have many yeers been due, And Creditors compel'd for them to sue Till they, in Labour, time, and other Cost, The Principal, and so much more have lost, The Shameless Officers instead of paying, Put off the Creditors, with this harsh saying, 'Tis an old Debt; as if men did them wrong To ask for that vvhich had been due so long; And, that, the way to right them, vvho implore Redress for old wrongs, vvere to do them more. Nay, there is so much falsehood and deceit In many, that, they make poor men to vvait From day to day, from morning untill noon, From noon till night, Delay, still spinning on, (Till many dayes and nights, and weeks are spent) As if to grant their Suits they truly meant, Although they from the first hour, did intend To give them flat denial in the end. And, usually, when they speak fair and smile, They pick your Purse, or cut your Throat the while. They, who are guilty of such things, and know That I, and thousands, know them to be so, Will say, perhaps, I Rail; but 'tis no matter; To Rail, is somewhat better then to Flatter. None but a Fool will term it Railing, when Reproaching Vices, we conceal the Men. None, but a Brazen-fac'd-Offender dares, Exceptions take to that, which truth avers; And none but Mad-men cast reproach on those Who chide them, to prevent their overthows. I will proceed to further Demonstration Of those Signes, which portend a Desolation. Strange Prodigies, which not so oft have been In this our Clymate, are now often seen. By Looks, or Language, it is hard to know VVhom you may now repute your Friend or Foe: They, who have but one Head, have now two Faces, And two Tongues: Both their Offices and Places, The Members of the self-same Body shift; Though neither of them, hath the others gift. The Little Toe, although to be a Thumb It hath been rais'd, will not content become, Unless it may obtain that both the Hands Shall be subjected under his commands. The Head's cut off; and though that in its stead, The Foot, may have admittance to be Head, It (quite forgetting what it vvas before) VVill scarce be pleas'd, unless it may be more. Nay, from Ambition, Vermine are not free; The nasty Body-Lice, would Head-Lice be. Those wicked Spirits that engender strife, Among us, more then ever, are now rife. Stupidity, Distraction, Giddiness, VVith such-like, many thousands do possess; And, haunted now, our Habitations are VVith vvorse Hobgoblins, then the Faires vvere. To their own Principles, but very few, Save Enemies and wicked Men are true. Those Changes, which but rarely did befal, Are in these Islands Epidemical. The Servant rides, the Master goes on foot, And, is his Servant's Servant, too, to boot: The silly School-Boyes do presume to teach; The Foxes pray, the foolish Geese do preach; And, most things are so turned topsy-turvy, That what looks best, methinks, is very scurvy. Not onely those Ægyptians, among whom We live, oppressors of us are become, But Brethren also strive; yea, Saints, with ire Are so inflam'd, that they call out for fire From Heaven, on those, who onely disagree From them, in things that but indiff'rent be; And, we are told, by one whom I believe, VVhat it portends, where such things we perceive. By Natural Experience, we have found That, Instruments which yeild a diff'ring sound, (And Tones, and Voices, though they various be) In Consort, do melodiously agree. So, we should likewise, finde these Differences In Judgement, whereat we now take Offences, VVould make true Harmony, if we to Him Did leave it, who knows how to order them; And took more care (then most of us have done) To set our own Tongues, and our Hearts in tune. Our Friends in Forraign Parts, and here at home, Each of the other jealous are become; And should there be a Breach, no Mortal knows VVhether our old Friends, or our elder Foes, VVould prove our greatest Enemies; or, whether They, would to mischieve us, joyn all together. Our New Allies, are likely at our need, To be to us, but an Ægyptian Reed, Or, like a costly Armour, by whose weight, VVe are more tir'd, then guarded in the Fight; And somewhat sounds from them (unless Fame lies) VVhich an unpleasing Sequel signifies. These things, (at least united) do foreshew That, some foul Weather shortly may ensue: GOD, also stands, with Arm outstretched still, The Sentence of His Justice to fulfil. If we consult but with meer Human Reason, VVhat's likely to succeed at such a Season As this appears, by loss of him alone, VVho lately was removed from the Throne: VVhat Counsels and what Cost it will require To keep so many Irons in the Fire As he hath left unwrought; and what it would Cost more, to let them lie till they are cold. If vve consider, That he was of late The Middle, and, main Pillar, of this State; The Atlas (as the Attribute that's giv'n By one, hath term'd Him) of our British Heav'n, And, into what Confusions, it is thought All things at his Decease, might have been brought; Observing therewithal (without concluding Upon false Theses, or, our selves deluding) In what apparent Dangers we are left, By being, at this time, of him bereft, It may portend, although the Sun shines yet, A Storm will rise before that he doth set. And yet, we ought not so much to reflect Our thoughts on Him, that we those things neglect Which more concern us; or suppose that we Depriv'd of any such advantage be, As is conceived; for, he had not gone, But, that, the work ordain'd for him vvas done. GOD, rais'd him, by Destroying, to prepare A vvay for that which he intends to rear, And, to that purpose qualifi'd him so, As they were, vvhom of old he call'd to do Such Services; and, as it seems, intended No further use of him, when that vvas ended: He saw, the Pow'r vvhich vvas on him bestowne Imployed in Designments of his own; Then, re-assum'd it: and, they had been troubled Perhaps, who pray his Spirit might be doubled On his Successor, if GOD, should have said AMEN, to that, for which they blindly pray'd. VVe, likewise, (as of late that Parliament From vvhom he took the Supreme Government) So Idolized, that, vve thought too little Confer'd upon him by the Soveraign Title VVhich, GOD permitted him to undertake, And, what his Army pleas'd of him to make. To govern us, vve long'd for such a Thing As other Nations have; forsooth, a King, VVith all the former burthensome Aray Of Kingship, which vvas lately took away: Though he, as much as Flesh and Blood could do, Refus'd it, vvith some perseverance too. And, not content to make him parallel VVith all who are recorded to excel In Vertues, by Prophane or Sacred Story; But plac'd him, in a higher Sphere of Glory. VVe gave him Attributes, vvhich unto none Belongs, but to the Deitie alone; And towards him, our selves oft so behaved, As if by him alone, we could be saved; VVhich peradventure, did provoke GOD's vvrath To do to Him and Us, as done He hath. GOD's dealing therefore, let us duly vveigh, To do him all the honour, that we may: For no respect of Persons, Love, or Fear, Should from that Duty, flatter or deter. To that intent, it will have some Relation, To know and heed, that his last Visitation By Sickness, did that Day on him appear, VVhich made the time compleatly just a Year, Since he solemnized a Publick Fast To pacifie GOD's Wrath for Failings Past; As also for removing from our Clime, Such Sicknesses, as raged at that time: And, that, some Cautions, for that day prepar'd, VVere in their Season, unto him prefer'd, To minde him vvhat small good could be expected From Formal-Fasts, vvhere Justice was neglected; And what at last would follow thereupon, If Works of Mercy, were still left undone. At that time, such Pre-Cautions tendred vvere (As, if need be, hereafter you shall hear) For, GOD, to offer them, did me incline, And, to his hands, they were prefer'd by mine: But, whether he perused them or no, Since they presented were, I neither know, Nor vvhat Effect they had, if that be none, VVhich at the years end, did ensue thereon. We should consider too, how on that day, Just that day twelve-month he was took away, (Wherein he kept a Formal Celebration Of Thankfulness, for publike preservation) That very day, of his chief Triumphs turning Into a sad and Fatal day of mourning: How that day, whereon (if Fame hath not lide) He purpos'd to be crowned King, he dide; Leaving an Image, with a waxen Face, To be instal'd, and crowned in his place: Which, as since we defac'd Crowns, 'twas the first That wore one, I desire, may be the worst, Who shall from this time forward, live to bear A Soveraign Scepter, or a Crown to wear. If we consider duly as we ought, These things; with such like, as to serious thought Are thereby tendred; more, from thence there might Inferred be, then I think fit to write. Or, should I tell, vvhat vvas prepar'd, likewise, To make compleat his Formal Sacrifize Last mentioned, and what effects it had, Some wholsome uses, might thereof be made Which must deferred be; because my Reason Perswades me, that they are not, yet in season. I know a Flatt'rer, feared not to say That, was the third time, his Victorious day By conqu'ring Death: But, wisemen, do contemn That Gloss, because, that day, Death conquer'd him; And, do believe, and know, that none but he Who dide for our Redemption on a Tree (And, rais'd himself, to breathe immortal breath) Ought to be stil'd the Conqueror of Death. He onely, vvho, above the Heav'ns doth dwell, And conquered vvith Death, both Sin and Hell, Deserves that Attribute: and they, vvho dare, To others give the same, Blasphemers are, (Except in that sense, which, makes all who die In him, partakers of his Victorie.) He had his share of Honour, and, not little His Portion was; Let not his Masters Title Ascribed be to him: For, they, who hear it, And are his Servants, cannot, will not bear it; Nor be affraid to speak, vvhat may encrease GOD's honour, vvhose soe're it maketh less. GOD call'd him hence that day, to make us heed, That, he in all his Actings doth proceed By Number, Weight, and Measure; both to places, And Times referring them in many cases, To make observable his Visitations; As also, to raise up our contemplations To that, vvhich he Designs: yea, he advances Their executions, oft, with Circumstances, Not common; that, by searching, we may finde His meaning, and conform unto his minde. I know, he vvas upon that day, advis'd To somewhat, vvhich he should not have despis'd Whereto he gave small heed, or none at all, Till vvhat vvas justly feared did befal: And, vvho knows, vvhat beside that vvas neglected? VVhat vvas pretended then, vvhat, since projected? Or, vvhat mis-prosecuted, or mis-done, Which might provoke the great Almighty-one, To call him on that very day from hence, VVhich vvas the day of his magnificence; And lay the Scepter level with the spade. Oh! make thereof, such use as should be made; For, knowing vvhat I know, relates thereto, I, cannot unobserved let it go. We know that Death, vvhich is the hire of Sin, On that day, always payable hath bin, In vvhich 'tis acted, though, GOD, by reprieve Defers it oft, or, vvholly doth forgive. We know there are some sins, for vvhich, ev'n they VVho are GOD'S chosen ones, are took away From those Enjoyments, vvhich they might have had, Until a Forfeiture of them is made. Moses, for speaking rashly, was denyed The promis'd Land, and in that Desart dyed, Where others fell; and, thus, it doth befal To many of GOD's Saints, if not to all. We either know, or vve should know, likewise, That, for our National impieties As vvell as for their own sins, Princes may In wrath be given, or, be took away. The Holy-Ghost hath said, that, when to lies The King gives ear (and such are Flatteries) The people, there are wicked. And, our sin The Cause in chief, hath peradventure bin, VVhich, from his first Intentions, him declin'd, To that vvhich vvas not for our weal design'd, Nor for his honour: yea, our selves vve may Most justly blame, if he forsook the way VVherein, he by the Publike-Card should steer: For, some of us thereto his Tempters were, And, by our servile Flatt'ries, both made voyd His first Resolves, and our own Hopes destroy'd. As, therefore, when GOD, gave the Jews a King, He then, did by a dreadful Thundering, And by a great Rain in their Harvest time, Declare that they had much displeased him; So, peradventure, that Storm, which did roar So universally four days before He took hence our Protector, was intended To signifie, that he is much offended With all this Land, ev'n from him that's on high Enthron'd, to him, who in the street doth lie: For, not alone, high Palaces it rock'd, But, also very dreadfully it knock'd At ev'ry door; and made a signal spoile, In ev'ry Shire and Province of this Isle. Oh! let us therefore search out his intent; For, when he speaks loud, there is somewhat meant Deserving more then ordinary heed, Whereon (if sleighted) mischief will succeed. He seldom, putteth forth a dreadful Voyce, Save unto those, whom nothing moves but Noyse: And, if that, wakes them not, nor makes them fear him, The next time, they shall feel him, ere they hear him. Let not a vain respect to Worms and Dust, Make us to GOD, and to our selves unjust: For, what he acts, and how he doth proceed, We ought, in ev'ry Circumstance to heed, Whomever it concerns, and nothing hide, Whereby he may be duly glorifide, Or, men reform'd. Then, let us, since we may Be dead to morrow, hear his Voyce to day. We have had many days, wherein, he hath Shewn Mercy, and forewarn'd us of his wrath. Sometimes, in Calm-still voyces, he doth speak; Sometimes, in whirl-winds, which the Rocks do break: As once 'twas sayd to Isr'el heretofore, Then what he hath done, what should he do more? We have had many days, wherein, we made Both Vows and Prayers, which acceptance had; In them we made some shews of penitence For that, which gave him cause to take offence, And for an Ahab-like humiliation, GOD, of his dooms, vouchsaf'd a mitigation; Yet, still, the very same, our Courses be. Now, GOD, will have his days as well as we. He hath decreed a time, wherein, he will As we have done our pleasure, his fulfil; And who can tell, how slowly, or how soon, That, which he hath resolved, shall be done? What look we for? Lo, on a day of note, Our Shepherd, our Protector, he hath smote. A Prince, of whom our own and neighb'ring Nations, Had great proofs, and far greater expectations: Beyond his set day, if he spar'd not him, How can we hope, he will defer our time? Who knows, but that, if it succeeded thus With him in one yeer, One yeer more to us May be as fatal, if we still put off Repentance, and at this fore-warning scoff? Protector, and ye Counsellors of State, Be therefore wise, before it be too late: Ye Princes, and ye Judges of the Land, Learn, and observe what GOD hath now in hand: And all ye people throughout these three Nations, Take notice of those dreadful Visitations Which are portended, that, they may be made Quite voyd, and have Effects to make you glad. Trust not in Riches, for, they wings have got, And, will flie off, when you suspect it not. Trust not in Earthly Power; for 'twill at length, Break, and be ruined, by its own strength. Trust not in Princes; For you can of none Have more hopes, then you had of him that's gone; But, trust him, who, doth no mans trust deceive; Of whom nor Death, nor ought else can bereave; And, vvho, nor Love, nor Power, nor wisdom lacks To finish, what for you he undertakes. Think, and speak soberly of him that's gone; For, he the work of GOD hath carry'd on, So far as his appointed Station vvent; And, being but a mortal Instrument Made of the self-same brittle earthen stuff, That others are, was not, of so much proof Against the baneful Flatteries of those, VVho seem'd his true Friends, as against his Foes In open Field, who could not act the part Of such as made their Batt'ries on his heart. I look upon his Failings as mine own, And neither whilst he lived made them known, (Nor will disclose them further being dead) But, that the living may be profited, And that, GOD may be honour'd as he ought By that which to remembrance should be brought. My Conscience bears me witness that I know No malice, in my heart against a Foe, Much less against a Friend, vvhom I profest To serve; and vvho, to his own Interest (In what he from the right-way did decline) Did much more injury, then unto mine. His Words and Deeds, were all the means I had To know him by; and what Result was made By me thereon, I did since his decease Thus briefly in an Epitaph express, Which here I'll add, the Censures to prevent Both of the Flatt'rer and Malevolent, Who (in a manner) crucifie his Name, Betwixt a Glorious and In-glorious Fame As much as may be, to advance self-ends, And nullifie, what GOD, thereby intends. The EPITAPH. Here Dead He lies; who, Living here, Was Britain's greatest Hope and Fear. And, by what was on Him bestown, Had all His Equals over-grown: His Predecessor's Sins and our, Made way for Him to Soveraign Power; By rendring that an Act of Reason And Justice, which had else been Treason. No Prince, was ever heretofore More praised, or dispraised more. Advantages, few ever won So great: None lost so great a one. This World afford no Pattern can Which better shews what is in Man. His Vertues, were enough to do, So much as GOD design'd Him to. He Failings had: But, when liv'd any That had not every way as many, If he (whilst here abode he made) Such Tempters and Temptations had? Presume not therefore; but with Fear Minde, what you know, and see, and hear: Yea heed, what GOD, and Men have done, But judge none but your selves alone; And aim in chief, how to increase GOD's Glory, and the Publick Peace. This Change, and failing of our Expectations, In many sev'ral Things, which have Relations To Us and Him, forewarn us to pursue Some speedy Course, Confusion to eschew, And fortifie our Peace: But, what to do Few know, or vvhat vvill best conduce thereto; Nor shall know, till a Parliament convenes To search vvhat GOD, this Prince, &amp; People means. In order to their wish'd-for Settlement, The State hath chose another Instrument, Whom GOD, hath in the room of OLIVER, Permitted to be his Probationer. In Prudence, this Expedient they have us'd, Lest our Confusions, growing more confus'd, Might bring in Anarchy: And if they now, Pursue vvhat GOD's, and humane Laws allow, And shall not Arbitrarily proceed Ought further, then unquestionable Need Necessitates, till those things on their Basis Are fixed, vvhich vvere thrust out of their places: It may in little time, conduce to that Which Men of single Heart, have aimed at. But, who, or what, vvill henceforth be a Bar To Righteousness, the Sequel must declare, And vvill make manifest, vvhat Mask soever It put upon an opposite Endeavour. If he hath conscientiously been chose, (Which none but GOD and his Electors knows) Our Peace, by this Prince, vvill be further'd more, Then by him vvhom vve vvrought vvith heretofore. Although he brings not such APPEARANCES Either for His, or Our Advantages, As did his Predecessor: for vve may Finde those Defects supplide another vvay; Yea, vvant perhaps, of what the former had In some kindes, may to our advantage add. Time, oft discovers in a timely season, What cannot be till then discern'd by Reason. Wise Samuel, fail'd in his conjecturing VVhich of the Sons of Jesse should be King. A Man of War, now fittest for the Throne Some thought; but, vve behold instal'd thereon A Man of Peace: And if in his Probations He bide the Test, he shall be to these Nations, A Fortress of Defence, in spight of those, VVho, in his Government, shall him oppose; Provided, vve obstruct not Providence, By persevering in impenitence. The Supreme Title, is on him confer'd, And, by vvhat vvay soe'er it vvas acquir'd, That, for the present vvith a Soveraign Pow'r Invests him; and vvhatever we call our, Is in his hands, vvith all th'Authority VVhich Scepters, Globes, or Crowns do signifie. And, of that Dignity he stands possest (By GOD's permissive Providence, at least) Not that he should Usurp, or challenge them, As due unto his Fathers House, or Him; But, being forfeited by our Transgression, Them, in his hands he hath by sequestration, To be secur'd there, till by Penitences, A Pardon, be su'd out, for our Offences, That, vvhat, by Natures Law, and by GOD's Word, To us belongeth, may be then restor'd: For, GOD, Almighty, to no other ends, Such Seizures, by a Soveraign Prince intends: Save when, on wicked Nations he bestowes A wicked Prince, for both their overthrows. If to GOD's ends, he Quadrate his Desire, He, shall become, far greater then his Sire. He shall do nobler things, then ere he did; More he shall Conquer, then he conquered: Affairs, which he of whom vve are bereft, Both difficult and in confusion left, He shall reduce to Order; not alone Subduing Men and Realms, as he hath done, But conquer also, those destructive Evils, Which would destroy all, and triumph o'er Devils. Nay, though he had been, either by his Youth, By Flatterers, pretending zeal to Truth, Or if he by a carnal Hope or fear Of Danger, had been tempted to adhere To those Designs, which under fair pretences, May, to the Publick Rights, do violences; Yet, if he shall conform to GOD, and them, Whose Love, and Counsel, he should not contemn; It shall (by much) a greater honour do him, Then Scepters, Crowns, and Thrones can add unto him. Yea, if upon the day of his Probation He to the Supreme Council of this Nation, (Assembled lawfully, and duly chose) Shall rather hearken, then give ear to those Who flatter him in secret; they shall never Forsake him, but his Servants be for ever. It shall on him, confer more Happiness Then, I in words, am able to express. VVin him more Love then can by gold be bought, Bring in more Joy, keep Terrors better out, And (whilst on Earth he lives) secure him more, Then if each single Souldier vvere a score; And, were my Life, of value to be pledg'd For that Adventure, it should be ingag'd. Contrary-wise, if he their Lore pursue VVho will perswade him, that all is his due VVhich he can grasp; or shall instead of Law Imploy the sword, to keep Free-Men in aw; GOD, will arise; and none shall need to strive, A Remedy, by Violence, to contrive. For if we vvait on him, and sit but still, Submitting patiently unto his Will, Our Chief Oppressors he will cause to be Their own destruction, and so set us free. Or, make our Foes our Friends, and back restore All that was taken from us heretofore. By such means, GOD in former times releast His People, who by Tyrants were opprest, As doth appear, by that which did befal In Babylon, and in th'Egyptian-thral, VVhere, not a man made use of hand, or tongue To free himself, by violence, from wrong, Except by Prayers, which (although offence It gives to some) is lawful violence. And, by some such means when GOD's time is come, Our Bondage, we shall be deliver'd from. GOD, hath a thousand wayes, to break the pow'r Of twentie thousand Tyrants in an hour; Yet, may prove many Tooles, till he finds one, Or, moe, to finish what he hath begun. If this turn Edge, he, peradventure may Take those again, that have been flung away, VVhich being purged in Afflictions Fire, VVill, now be pliable to his Desire. Their Actings, vvhom vve now impow'red see, VVill shortly, evidently signal be, Of what shall follow: But, I fear th'event, VVill not produce a happy Settlement, Till our Trustees, Elected shall appear For Conscience-sake, more then for Belly-Cheer, Or such-like by-respects; (by which we seem To have our Birth-Rights in a mean esteem:) And, till, GOD, likewise, hath by Lot a Voice, (As well as men) both in the future Choice Of our Protectors; and of others too, Who must help act the work that's yet to do. But, this will be no pleasing Proposition To Avarice, Self-seeking and Ambition. There's yet a Signe (to which things fore-exprest Relation have) more signal then the rest, Which, if it shall continue as it hath Continu'd, will add Vengeance, unto Wrath; And, what vain hope soever, we may cherish, VVe, with our Prince and Government, shall perish. GOD, where this grows predominant, despises All Vows, Tears, Prayers, Cries and Sacrifices, Fasts and Thanksgivings: For, he findes them all VVhere this remains, but Hypocritical. This is that Signe, which did in ev'ry Age, Those irrevocable Fore-Dooms presage, That introduc'd the final Desolations, Of all those mighty Empires, Kings and Nations, VVhereof there's little left now, but a Name, Preserv'd among us by an empty Fame, For our Examples: This is that which shook Their Thrones, their Crowns defac'd, their Scepters broke: Yet, this Signe is upon us, at this day; From us, with speed, remove it LORD, away. You look, as men expecting I should show VVhat Signe that is. Good GOD! what do you know If this you know not? Do you not behold That Signe, by what I have already told? Are you asleep Friends? have you neither Ears Nor Eyes, that, undiscern'd this yet appears? Do you not hear the Groans of Men distrest? The Loud-loud Cries, of those who are opprest? Nor what a sad Complaint attested stands This day, by many hundreds of their hands? Have you not heard, how Pris'ners do complain? Nor seen what Tears are poured out in vain By Widdows and poor Orphanes? see ye not What vast Estates are by Oppressors got, To their undoing, who their Lively-hood, Their Fathers, Husbands, or their Brothers Blood Lost for the Publick? see you not how sad (Poor souls) they are? how lean, and how unclad? Have you not heard a Merciless-Decree Condemn the Just, and set the Wicked free? Do you not see, that, hundreds of Petitions Have many yeers made known Mens sad conditions, Without Compassion? and what dis-regard Befalls them, who have merited reward? Observe you not, that they, who made complaints Ev'n unto those who are esteemed Saints, Finde them as sensless of their saddest moans, As men hew'd out of Blocks, or carv'd in stones? And, that Hypocrisie (in GOD's account The worst of sins) is now grown Paramount? Have you not seen Blood, as if water spilt, And Black Designes with Golden Colours guilt? Nor many foul Offences made appear As if they meritorious Actions were? Perceive you not, who joyning are together, VVho give and take Pow'r, to and from each other, To re-infringe our Christian Liberty? And, by pretending Zeal to Piety, Or Civil Peace, advance the Interest Of our old Foe, the Seven-headed Beast, VVith his False Prophet? and invented have A Grin, both Soul and Body to inslave? Perceive you not, that Importunities, VVhich made one from his Bed and Children rise, (And mov'd a Judge, who fear'd not GOD nor Men) Prevails not now, as it prevailed then? And, that, Mens tender Mercies are become More cruel, then their Cruelties to some? Nay, see you not, this Signe more signal made By that, which our Apostacies now add? And, that, this day, we do apparently Stand guilty of the great'st Apostacie From our first Covenants, Vows and Protestations, Then ever could be charged on these Nations? Obsérve you not, what foolish Prophesies VVe take up? how, of Fictions and of Lies VVe make us Refuges, as heretofore They did, whose Paper-Works, we down have tore? And how the lying Prophets and the Priests Comply, to save their carnal Interests? Have you not lately taken observation, That Laws by gross, have had a confirmation, Of which there's nothing on Record, (or little) To warrant them, except their Names or Title? And heed you not what Mischieves that abuse VVith such-like, may insensibly produce? VVell, GOD, forgive us all; for I believe These things you may apparently perceive. But, if you shall make doubt, whether or no It be, as I believe, or else, not so, To GOD Himself, for tryal I'll appeal, And, to the People of this Commonweal, VVho, know what's done, and will not be afraid To justifie what may be truly said. For, when this Signe is fix'd; though men look high Or big, it shews Destruction draweth nigh. Yea, though the Proud may seemingly contemn This Signe, it will impressions leave on them: For, horrid inward Pangs, and secret Dread VVill seize upon their Hearts, when this is read; And that great Storm of Brimstone, Fire, and Snares, VVhich GOD, for men impenitent prepares, VVill oft to minde be brought; and waking keep Their eyes, sometimes, when they desire to sleep. But to be plain (why should there be a doubt Of that whereof, Proofs need not to be brought?) I, see the want of Justice and Compassion (The most apparent Signe of Desolation) So evident; that, I, do boldly here Before GOD, Men and Angels, witnesse bear That our Oppressions are at this day more Then ere I knew them at one time before, Since first I knew the world; though I have been No stranger where mens actings best are seen; And, where I saw (for their and our Offences) Six Parliaments cut off by Violences, Or by untimely ends, within the space Of these last twenty years, and somewhat less: Yea, though I've seen two Governments arow Destroyed for Injustice; and see now A Third indanger'd; which thus makes me speak, And like the Son of Crœsus, forth to break Into expressions beyond Expectation, To make men seek their timely Preservation. For this Signe is so fatal, that unless It quickly be remov'd by Righteousness And Brotherly Compassion, we shall never Enjoy that Peace for which we do endeavor. Some, naytheless, will judge me worthy blame And punishment, thus to disclose the shame Of this my Nation; and, I should confess That for so doing, I deserv'd no less, If Malice had inclin'd me thereunto; Or, if I ought have aggravated so, That it exceedeth Truth; or, if o'er-blown These Crimes had been, unless by me made known. But, 'tis not so, nor so; And, if he may Deserve the Rod, who doth but write or say What is mis-done, (and speaks it with intent Those Mischieves which may follow to prevent) What merit they, who act them without care Of what sad things, they certain Symptomes are? That this bears Date the last day of December In sixteen hundred fifty eight, remember; And, that a Reconcilement be before VVe have provok'd GOD's Patience, one yeer more; Lest, I my self, be made another Signe Of what the former Symptomes pre-divine. For, those Confusions VVhich distract this Sate, Are typified in my outward Fate, And printed on me, by that violation Of Justice, which defiles this Generation. They seem to have enough in outward show, To bear their Port, to pay the Debts they ow, And for the future a sufficiency: So also, if I had my Right, have I. As (notwithstanding this) with much ado They, now subsist: So, fares it with me too. As, at the present, their Expences be More then their Incomes; So it is with me. They have more Foes then Friends; And much I am Deceived, if I may not say the same. My Foes and troubles in another year May ruine me; and so will theirs I fear If he on whose assistance I depend Prevents not what their Foes and mine intend, Before another yeer wheels round, I may Enjoy an outward Peace; And so shall they If they embrace the means, that will be shown, And, follow not Devices of their own. Yea, that perhaps, which will to them betide, Shall in my Lot, be first pretypifide. If timely Justice, be vouchsaf'd to me, By timely Mercies, they reliev'd shall be: If I, permitted am to be destroy'd, Their Power, may not long after be enjoy'd: And GOD so much incensed may appear (As with the Jews once) that, he none will hear But for himself, who ere from thenceforth stands Within the Gaps, to keep Plagues from these Lands. Thus, in plain language, and in homely Rimes You have a brief Character of these times, Made on a sleight occasion; to awake The drowzie; that more heedful, it may make Men heedless; and him to be somewhat wiser Who is not of good Counsel, a Despiser. A Souldiers dream, but of a barly-Cake Told to his fellow, when he did awake, And Spirited with his Interpretation, Produced an Effect, worth observation; And so may this, although to some, it seem, No better then a silly Souldiers dream. I'll add no more (though much more add I might) For, here will be too much for them to sleight, Who, in those Flatt'ries, much more pleasure have That send them with dishonour to the Grave, Then in plain spoken Truths, which would to them Have brought salvation, if embrac'd in time. And here, will be enough to startle some, To stir up others, till th'Alarum come To such a number, as may then suffice To make a reconciling Sacrifice. Unless we Sodom-like, stand unreform'd Until with Fire and Brimstone, we are storm'd. This SALT, made out of SALT, I took occasion To boyl up, for the service of my Nation To this height, as conceiving it was meet To keep what's yet unputrified sweet, And those corrupted humors to expel Which in GOD's nostrils have an evil smel. I hope, men will not throw it in mine eyes, Neither so universally despise These timely warnings, that they shall by none To good effect, be read, and thought upon: And, if but two or three, shall thereby gain Some benefit, I have not lost my pain. Mine be the shame, if I, hereby to him Intend disgrace, whose Verses, are my Theam. I did but thus, his Mercury calcine For Physick; Let him do as much by mine; And, if, ought from my failings, he deduce Which may to others, be of wholsom use, I, shall be pleas'd; because, what lose I may In one kind, will be gain'd another way. But, if he hath, so generous a minde As to believe he hath, I am inclinde, He will return me thanks, that I have us'd To no worse purpose, that which he hath mus'd. Yea, and rejoyce, that, what in sport he writ, This needful premonition did beget. When I had pen'd this, and o'erview'd the same, Therewith consid'ring what a worm I am, What they are, who, offence thereat may take; What misconstructions, Prejudice may make; With what scorn and contempt it may be read; And, having therewithal considered That, I, am one adhering to no Faction, To give me countenance in such an Action. Nor having in my self, pow'r to defend me, From Injuries, nor Patron to befriend me; It quail'd my Courage; and I'll not dissemble, It made my heart ake, and my Flesh to tremble. And I had hid my Talent in the ground, Unless, a timely Cordial had been found. But, he who gave it, my faint heart reviv'd; From him, new Resolutions I receiv'd, Wherewith confirm'd, my Soul to him addrest Such Musings, as are next, in Words exprest. Lord GOD, if, to thy glory, this may tend, Give it, some way a Pasport to that end, And set thy Imprimatur thereupon; For, Thou hast done it, if it be well done: If it be such, as will not honour thee, 'Tis mine, and as mine, let it smother'd be. I feel a strong perswasion, in my minde, That, hereunto, I was by thee inclinde And, that, there may be somewhat more exprest, Whereby, thine, and the Publike Interest May be advanced; which if it be so, And, thou shalt please, to call me thereunto, By giving me a Spirit, that may fit So weak an Agent, to adventure it, I'll prosecute it home, although it shall Cost all, which in this World, I mine can call. I have been subject to some Hesitations, Through pity, to those dear and near Relations, Which thou on me bestow'dst; and thereby, have Lost much, which by that means, I thought to save, To make me take more heed, by, and from whom All things that shall advantage me, must come: Them, therefore, henceforth, I resolve to trust To thy disposal, whom, I knew so just, That, thou of those, unmindful canst not be, Who truly place their Confidence on thee: And, now to fix in me, a Confidence For time to come, upon thy Providence, By those Experiments, which I have seen, I will confess, what thou, to me hast been. So universally thou dost extend Thy Love, that, all men it doth comprehend, Who shall not wilfully reject thy Grace, When thou, to them shalt offer an embrace; And, all things dost vouchsafe, which may enable To honour thee, or make life comfortable, So far, as we may carnal things possess, Without obstructing, our chief happiness. To evidence this gratiousness of thine, No living mans experience outgoes mine: For, ev'ry Faculty of mine hath heard Thy wondrous Mercies, thereunto declar'd In its own language, to th'intelligence As well of every Passion, and each sense, As of my Reason; so, that I can say They have to me, abounded ev'ry way. For since I knew the World (ev'n ever since) Thine, extraordinary providence Hath watched over me; and, I, from none Have had subsistence, but, from thee alone; Or, by those, whom no temporal Relation Could move thereto, without thine Invitation; Kind'red have been to me, in wants and dangers, If not my Foes, at best, more strange then Strangers: And, not the smallest portion of my wrong Hath from their malice, or their envie sprung. Few have been more Censorious of my ways, Or, apter to believe what malice says. That, which my secret Foes designed had, To ruine my estate, thereto did add; And, through thy mercy, more unto me gave Then ere I got, by all the Friends I have. Friendships acquired by mine own endeavor, And, all my own works, have been fruitless ever; Except it were, to bring those troubles on me, Which have no less then twice or thrice undone me, And made work for thy Mercy. Thrice, thou hast Redeem'd me, when in Prison I was cast By Supreme Pow'r; and freed me without shame, When I was threatned, by the voyce of Fame With loss of limb and tortures, and knew none On whom I could rely but thee alone. Through dangers, into safety, thou hast led me; And, when I wanted meat, by Ravens fed me. Twice, nigh as poor as Job, I have been made; And ev'ry time, that, which was lost, I had To me returned double; without cheating The Common-Wealth; or private men defeating, Of what to them belonged; Nor, by wiving, (Which is to some, a sudden way of thriving) Was my Estate repair'd; nor thereunto, Did I, by fawning upon Friend or Foe, Add ought; nor ever had a Legacy To me bequeath'd, these losses to supply; But, by such means, that, if I should declare it, Few would, perhaps, believe it, when they hear it. For, I confess, that I my self do wonder, When past, and present things, I duly ponder, In what great Wants, I, without Want have liv'd, And under what Oppressions, I have thriv'd. This makes the World, which hitherto hath grutcht That, I, with what is hers should be enricht, (As many think I am) to wonder more How I, whom she intended to keep poor, Subsist in her despight, then, how all they Grew wealthy, who were beggars tother day: And from her sight, thy Bounty, being hid, She thinks, I thrived, as her Servants did. And, leaves no means unpractis'd, to destroy That Competencie, which, I yet enjoy. When to be thought poor, it may do me shame, (Or, make me poorer, then she thinks I am) She taketh all occasions, then, to say That, more I owe, then ever I can pay. When to be deem'd rich, may deprive of that Which is my due; she trebles my Estate. But to prevent the mischief, which thereby Had else ensude, thou sent'st in a supply; And, always, hast enabled me, at least To bear the weight, wherewith, I was opprest. Thou, likewise, kept'st me without shame of face, Maugre Detractions, malice, when Disgrace Was then, and there intended, where it might With most disparagement, on me alight: And though but few, more scandaliz'd have been, Few, of my Rank, have liv'd in more esteem. Thou, from the violence of great Oppressors Of Pietie's, and Friendship's, false Professors Hast often sav'd me; yea, and from the Rage Of those, to whom, I long since did presage VVhat they, and I, saw afterward inflicted, According as my Muses had predicted; And, they, who then, for that, at me did rave, Have many yeers, lain quiet in the Grave. In that great Pestilence (whereof no time Hath mentioned the like, in this our Clime) Thou did'st preserve me, when on ev'ry side, In short time, many twenty thousands dide, Though underneath the self-same Roof I lay, VVhere many by that Plague were took away, That I might leave that Judgement on record, To them who were reserved for the sword: And when the Sword was sent his work to do, From that, thy Mercy, did preserve me too. Thou hast, moreover, from the menacing And dreadful Wrath of an incensed King Deliver'd me, without a Mediator, Or back receding in the smallest matter, From Truths aver'd. Thou from th'unjust intent Of Evil Members in a Parliament Did'st twice preserve me: and, all those Neglects, Of Justice, and those other sad effects Which I have suff'red, Demonstrations be VVhat, most men are, and what thou art to me. Nay (which is more then this) thou hast, thereby Not onely shewn to me the Vanity Of other men; but also, made mine own Deficiencies unto my self, more known: And both my Sins and Follies to appear More my advantage, then my Vertues were: For, those things, which the Devil to undo me Design'd; and whereto Flesh and Blood did wo me, Thou mad'st to be a means of Preservations From those, and also, from the like Temptations; And all the troubles, which the world brings on me, With those great Injuries which have been done me, (Instead of harming me) have in the Dust But tumbled me, to rub away the Rust; Or been a necessary Discipline, To fit me for those Services of Thine, VVhich else had been omitted to this day; Or, if done, not so done, as now they may: For which my Soul out of that Dust doth raise A Voice, in Hallelujahs, to thy Praise. Yet lest, these thy great Mercies, might at length, Prove ineffectual, by that little strength VVhich is in Flesh and Blood, if they vvere quite Depriv'd of that, wherein they take delight; THOU, who know'st vvhat defects are in mans nature, (And therefore art indulgent to thy Creature) Hast graciously been pleas'd to intermingle VVhat might distaste, or be unwholesome single; So temp'ring sweet vvith sow'r, that I by neither Might harm receive, but Good from both together: And, vvheresoe'er I live, dost still provide To neighbour me, one of the Sons of Pride, To make me vvatchful, and consider vvell VVhere I yet am; and, among whom I dwell. To me, Thou likewise hast vouchsaf'd a share In vvhatsoever Pleasant doth appear To men of all Degrees, vvho grow not mad Or drunk, by those Delights, vvhich they have had: For Poverty and Sorrow have to me Made Common things, more pleasureful to be Then their chief Dainties, vvho to that are born VVhich must be won by others, ere 'tis worn; VVho have but such Enjoyments at the best, As they, who come full gorged to a Feast. Yet, when of those Delights, I am bereav'd, By whose enjoyment, I content receiv'd; They leave not, (when departing I do finde them) A Bitterness upon my Soul behinde them; But, give the better appetite to those Whose taste, and pleasure, I shall never lose: And LORD, it flows from thy great Mercy, too, That, flesh and blood, should willingly forgo What constitutes themselves, to place affection Upon an inconceivable Perfection. Though, (as Thou know'st) the world my Foe hath bin, And, would afford me little share therein; A Portion I have also, there acquir'd By thy Free-Grace, more then I once desir'd: And vvhen I coveted more to possess, (Though by a lawful meanes,) thou mad'st it less, To minde me, that, nought will with me indure, Save what by Thy meer Bounty, I procure. If, therefore, it be lost, confess I must That, Thy permission of it will be just; And, with contentment, I will let it go, Though all the rest, be taken from me too: For, I most covet those things to enjoy, Which neither I, nor others can destroy: And, though sometime, Thy Cup imbitter'd be, By those distempers vvhich remain in me, I take it, naytheless, with true Thanksgiving, And vvould not change my Lot with any living. Though out of Levity and Custom, too, I, ev'ry day, think, wish, and speak, and do Like other foolish Men: yet, if I know Mine own Mind, though Thou vvould'st on me bestow All I could vvish, for vvishing; I vvould vvave That Grant: and onely ask of Thee to have VVhat Thou vvilt; and that Thou vvould'st take away My Self-will, though my Life upon it lay: For nought I now desire, to have or be, But what may be best pleasing unto Thee: And, if this temper could be still retain'd, Men vvould believe, vvhat they, yet, think is fain'd. To fortifie my Faith, and that desire VVherewith, at present, Thou dost me inspire, Thus of thy Mercies past, I have in part Confession made: and, if I know my heart, I durst not them before Thee thus aver, VVho knowest all things, if untrue they vvere. Yet, pardon my mistakes, if any be, And, make, what I conceive thou art to me, A Pledge, of what thou wilt be, to mine end. Above all other Enemies, defend And, save me from my self: For, World nor Devil, Can then inflict upon me any evil, That shall deprive me of ought transitory, Which may advance my welfare, or thy Glory. Next to my self, my second-self, and They Who sprung from us, do stand most in the way To hinder me, in that, whereto, my minde Perswadeth me, it is by thee inclinde: For, my respect to them, I must confess, Oft, makes me guilty of faint-heartedness. Oh! be so merciful to them and me, That, neither of us, may a Grievance be Unto each other, in vvhat doth pertain To Thy Affairs, whilst vve on Earth remain; Or make us, vvith Reluctancy, to spare Our selves to serve Thee; Or, vvhat is more dear To either, then our selves: But, give each other To thee, that we in thee, may live together VVhen we are called hence, and timely know Our Bliss consists not in things here below. I know, Thou art vvell pleas'd it should be thus, And that, hereto Thou wilt enable us: For, though I feel them, to be somewhat neerer Unto my Flesh, Thou to my Soul art dearer; And, as thou gav'st them vvhen they vvere desir'd, I'll back return them, vvhen they are requir'd, VVith mine own Soul to boot: Do not dispise This All; For, in these, All, I sacrifice. To Thee, for these Relations, I am Debter, Then vvhich I know no man enjoyeth better, VVho meriteth so little the possessing Of any extraordinary Blessing. Yet, if thou hast a Work to call me to, By which, I may my Self, and them undo, I'll undertake it, so, Thou stand but by me, And shalt thereto, with needful Pow'r supply me. Yea, though Thou shalt no more Thy Blessings double As heretofore; but waste away in trouble (By multiplied Sufferings, Wants, and Grief) The remnant of my, yet, prolonged Life; I am resolv'd, that, I will never more Thereat, repine again, as heretofore: But onely pray, my Sins, may be forgiven, Believe, and love, and seek my LOT in Heav'n. LORD, keep me in this minde; and then, let MAN, World, Flesh, and Devil, do the worst they can. Sarcasmus Ænigmaticus. Hereto is added the following Riddle, with the occasion of composing it, as neither altogether impertinent to what precedes, nor to what is counselled by this Portion of Scripture; Answer a Fool, according to his foolishness, lest he be wise in his own conceit, Prov. 26. 5. As well, to Foes, as Friends, I thought it fit To shew this Poem, ere I publish'd it, Because a Foe, sometimes, lets fall a word, Which (heeded well) more Caution may afford Then friendly Censurers: And, to that end, When I to some had read what here is pen'd; By them, proposed jeering Questions were, Fit for no Answer but by Counter-jeer. Yet I will Answer them, when unto me This following RIDDLE, shall unriddl'd be. What may that be, which, when it is Exprest Is most Unknown? Is Worst, when 'tis at Best? And when it is at Greatest, then 'tis Least? 'Tis Black and White, Red, Yellow, Blew and Green; Yet, Understood, Felt, Smelt, Heard, Tasted, Seen; Neither now is, nor shall be, nor hath been. To any one, who tells me what it is, That's answerable ev'ry way to this, I do engage; and thereto set my hand, To tell him any thing he doth demand. George Wither. A bitter-sweet Passion of the Soul, Expressed in A HYMNE to GOD. By The same Author. [1] My dear, my gracious GOD! From me Thy Face, why hidest Thou? Oh! why is Thy aboad So far, so long, removed now? See, how alone (Now Thou art gone) And helpless, I am left; Of ev'ry thing That joy may bring, Heed, how I am bereft. 2 I, who but lately seem'd Of many Friends belov'd to be, And so of some esteem'd, As if their Souls had liv'd in me; (Though, nor neglect, Nor dis-respect, Of them deserv'd I have) Am now, forlorn As one unborn, Or lodged in his Grave. 3 The lovely Desart-Owl, Which dares not fly abroad by Day; That persecuted Fowl, For which the Fowler Snares doth lay; Is not hipt at, As I, of late, By Wag-Tayls, Dawes and Crows. Nor hardlyer scapes His Gins and Traps Who seeks her overthrows. 4 For, when with some Delight, My heart began on Thee to muse, This World, forsook me streight; And, ever since, doth me abuse. To Hate and Scornes, Her Love she turns; Her Friends, my Foes she makes: What sland'rous Lies She can devise, Of me, she faines, and speakes. 5 And, now, with Vaunts and Brags, That, she, on me, aveng'd appears; From me, her gaudy Rags, With all her Gifts, away she tears: And not content So to have rent What was by her bestown, She would bereave (With what she gave) Those things, that are mine own. 6 She doth corrupt my Friends, My Wrongs and Sorrows to increase; Job's Comforters she sends, To make more grievous my Distress: To mind she calls, Things true and false, Which may my Peace impair; With whatsoe'er, May make me fear, And, let in Black Despair. 7 Not those Defects alone, For which, she justly me suspects, (Or Duties left undone,) To my Vexation, she objects; But, doth devise How, she likewise May to my blame pervert, What I design'd With upright minde, And singleness of heart. 7 And, (which augments my care) My Selfness oft with her conspires, Which ere I am aware Lets in false Fears, and vain desires; Which, taking part Against my Heart, Therein such Tumults make, That, sometimes, they Bear Spoiles away, And, cause my Faith to shake. 9 Yet this affrights me more, Then all their Malice, Force or Guile; Thou, though I Thee implore, Stand'st by, as Newter, all the while. What she hath done Thou look'st upon, And, knowst what they intend; Yet letst them still Pursue their Will, As if Thou wert her Friend. 10 Oh! whither or to whom Can I for Health or Comfort fly? If thou, my Foe become, Whereon, henceforth, shall I rely? I hope may have That in the Grave Immortal Life may be; And finde as well A Heav'n in Hell, As Joy in ought save Thee. 11 But, LORD, though in the dark, And in contempt, thy servant lies; On me there shines a Spark Of Loving-kindness from Thine eyes: Yea, though without (Quite round about) I am inclos'd with Sin, Increasing Foes, Fears, Wars, and Woes, Thou, Peace, preserv'st within. 12 For, when I looked on Those Terrors which begirt me round, I thought, Thou had'st been gone, Because no outward Hope I found. Yet hid Thou wert Within my Heart, Still present, all the while, And my late Fear Doth false appear: For, now I see Thee Smile. FINIS. The Prisoners Plea: Humbly Offered in a Remonstrance; With a Petition Annexed, To the Commons of England in Parliament Assembled; By GEORGE WITHER: Falsely charged to have composed a Lybel against the said Commons, and therefore now Prisoner in Newgate. It containeth also, many Interjections not to be despised; As also a Colateral Corolary, of publick Concernment; and in particular touching The Blood-shed, Whereinto God is now making Inquisition. My strength is made perfect in weakness; for when I am weak, I am strong. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in Persecutions, and in distresses for the sake of Christ, and a good Conscience. 2 Cor. 12. 9, 10. Jamq; Opus Exegi. My Life, and work (for ought, that yet I know) Is either quite, or almost ended now; And my Quietus est, within a Grave Is, that, which best would please me, now to have: For, by their struggling, many years together, My Flesh and Spirit, have nigh tir'd each other. Lord, let the short-snuff, of my Life unspent Burn out, with clear flames, and a pleasing scent. Newgate, January the 27th. 1661. Geo. Wither. THE END. A Memorandum to London, Occasioned by the Pestilence there begun this present year MDCLXV, and humbly offered to the Lord Maior, Aldermen and Commonalty of the said City. By George Wither. Thereto is by him added, a Warning-piece to London, discharged out of a Loophole in the Tower, upon meditating the deplorable Fier, which consumed the house of an eminent Citizen, with all the persons and goods therein, at the beginning of our most Joyful Festival, in December, 1662. Also, a Single Sacrifice offered to Almighty GOD, by the same Author in his lonely confinement, for prevention of the Dearth feared, and probably portended, by immoderate Raines in June and July, 1663. Moreover, in regard many have reported and believed this Author to be dead; we have annexed his Epitaph, made by himself upon that occasion. ?Quis Legit hæc, &amp;c. Who read such Lines as these? How few men, do they please? A Seasonable Memorandum Humbly tendred to the City of London, the Lord Maior, Aldermen, and the whole Commonalty thereof, by occasion of the Pestilence, begun this year, MDCLXV. By their Old Remembrancer, George Wither. The Psalmist, when he saw Truths foes grow strong A while resolved to withhold his Tongue Ev'n from Good words; (as I have often done) But, in his heart, New-musings then begun To muster so, that, he was forc'd to break His resolution, and his thoughts to speak. So fares it now with me; and I must do That which my Mover hath inclin'd me to: Vouchsafe it hearing, and GOD be my speed, For, it concerns you, and deserves good heed. This, now commencing, is the fourtieth year, Since first, the greatest Plague that raged here, Within our time, was sent for our correction, To scourge us, with a Pestilent Infection, That, GOD's intention, being timely heeded We, by Repentance, might have superseded Those following Judgments, which have ever since Inflicted been, for our Impenitence; And, are still multiplying, as if from GOD's quiver, Sharper Arrows were to come. That year, I having lived, till the Sun Had thrice twelve times, quite through the Zodiack run, Consider'd I had spun out half that time Within your Walls, and might be one of them For whose Transgressions, that sharp Visitation Came to destroy, or work a Reformation; And, thereupon (without constraint) intended To wait on God, where I had him offended; That, if to spare my life, vouchsafe he should, I might as truly serve him as I could, By heeding both his Actings, and our own; And making those things unto others known, Which I should then observe, might best promote His honour; and from being quite forgot, Keep that upon Record, (though to our shame) Which might hereafter, glorifie his Name. During that Plague, not one night, all the while, Remov'd I thence, the distance of one Mile, Or shuned either person, place, or sight, Which, me, experimentally then might Acquaint with any thing, whereby to learn My Duty, or what would my work concern; By which means, I found reason to confess (As Job in his probation did profess) That, I, who heard of GOD, but by the ear, Before that time, then, saw him as it were; And, had some things, likewise, to me reveal'd Which were from many wiser men conceal'd; So that I both foresaw, and then foretold What many thousands did fulfil'd behold Soon after: yea, moreover, some of them Who, many years, my Cautions did contemn, (And scofft at my Predictions) justifi'd That, which in times past, they did much deride. But, in their old waies, most men did proceed As if they took a very little heed, Of any thing, past, present, or to come, Which might preserve Peace, or prevent their Doom. What I then saw, and foresaw would befall, I did record, in that which I did call BRITANS REMEMBRANCER; and have not been Regardless, what transactions, here were seen During those fourty years of Provocation, Wherein, GOD's Spirit, by this Generation Hath greeved been. Of that large Premonition, At least four thousands at the first Impression Were publisht through these Islands, to prevent What seem'd at hand; and, to the same intent In several modes, at several times before This present day, five times as many more Premonitory hints, whereon ensue As mean effects, except among those few For whose sake (next his Sons) GOD, yet hath pity On these three Nations, and on this great City, Though they have persecuted and opprest Those, in whose Weal their welfare doth consist. But, this comes not within the Creed of many Nor can be possibly believ'd of any, Whom Pride, Self-love, and Ignorance bewitches Either with dotage upon Pleasures, Riches, Or Power exorbitant; because no Grace Can get admittance, where those fill the place, For, these, are part of those things where withall The Devil tempted Christ; and they who fall By not resisting him in that temptation Are drawn, at last, to yeeld him Adoration (Though peradventure they perceive it not) And, when he that advantage once hath got; It is not in the power of any one To dispossess him, bud of GOD alone. Judgements and Mercies, in the common mode Move not without th'immediate hand of GOD, Or, some impulses extraordinary When from his Dictates, wilfully they vary. The most Convincing Truths, make them but madder; They, to the wisest Charmer like the Adder, Still stop their ears; and them he works upon No more, then if he Sung unto a Stone. This renders these more brutish then a beast By whom CHRIST is but formally profest: For, Beasts will shun the dangers that pursue them; Meet those who feed them, when their meat they shew them; Know their preservers, yea return them too, Requitals, in their kind, for what they do: Whereas besotted men, ev'n when they may Perceive themselves beleagured ev'ry way With mischiefs; although plainly they may see That their Endeavours unsuccesful be In spight of all their policy or power, And, God, Avengments threatning every hour By Prodegies, and by Events, that from No mortall hand, to cross their hopes can come, They either look on them as casualties, Or, them not to concern, in any wise: Then, with full sailes, run head long on that Rock Which is in view; at their good counsel mock, Who tell them lovingly, how to avoyd That, whereby, they shall else be quite destroyd, If they proceed; or, cast an Anchor where, They, now in hope of Preservation are: And, if these be not madmen, there are none In Bedlam, where we hear is many a one. Ev'n as a nice and wanton Appetite, Longs after Kickshaws, and takes more delight In dishes made up of they know not what, And not so wholsome, as plain solid meat; So, most men, with Expressions are best pleas'd From whence, one sentence, hardly can be squeas'd Which well consider'd, any way conduces To civil manners or to pious uses, Though you should strain out all, that every word For Caution, or Instruction, might afford. To all such true Phanaticks, this will seem, To be perhaps, of very small esteem, Because, it speaks plain sense, and is not deckt And trim'd up with such gawds as they expect. Yet this, &amp; those strains which they much dispise, May be a means to make some fools more wise. GOD promis'd to his servants long ago, He would upon their Children shed forth so His holy spirit, in the later ages, That they should be inspired with presages Of things to come; and (to his Name be praise) This we have seen accomplisht in our daies. Strange Visions have appear'd, Truths are foretold, By men and women too, both young and old, Which (though to carnal men vain dreams they seem) With such as know God, they have more esteem, And will appear to be his Dispensations; As proper also, to these Generations, As those, which were dispenc'd, in ages past, Unto the Jews at first; or, at the last, When, as phanatik, and ridiculous, Their Prophets to them seem'd, as ours to us. For, oft by their Inspirer, they were moved To Speak and Act, what was by few approved; Sometimes, to personate, what was abhord, Or seem'd not with good manners to accord, Ev'n in their Judgements, who appeared then The wisest and the most religious men; Especially, when God impos'd on some, Things to be signal of what was to come. But, all his Dispensations heretofore, And now in use (or whatsoever more, Shall be hereafter) scarcely will suffice To make us, in these doting ages wise. God, hath omitted nothing to recal us Or, to prevent that, which may else befal us; For every year, and upon each occasion That did occur (to cause a perturbation Or breach into our Peace) he moved some So zealous of our welfare to become, That they their own peace have oft hazarded, (And lost it too) by things endevoured For our avail; yea, though their pains and cost, (As to themselves) was likely to be lost Persu'd their Aime, sometimes, by general Precautions, which did much concern us all; And, otherwhile, by memorizing that Which in particular seem'd to relate To Persons or to Places, as it best Might bring advance to publick Interest: Forewarnings have by GOD vouchsafed been To you by others (as they cause have seen) Who seem'd to come with more authority And trusted with Credentials, whereof, I Unworthy am; But, whatsoever they Or I appear, that, which I have for you Prepared by Gods help, I offer now, In hope, it will be heeded somewhat more Then that, which hath been tendred heretofore. This year his former Judgements GOD repeats, And, once again, your sinful City threats With Pestilence. He, over us doth shake A dreadful Rod, wherein I notice take Of three sharp twiggs; and he above knows whether They shall be singly felt or all together, Because, he onely knows what will be done To stay that, which already is begun, And keep out those two, which your City threat, But, have not yet got entrance through the gate. London, I fear, unless thou take more heed In what Course thou hereafter dost proceed (Although that God's Long-suffering towards thee Continues yet) at once, with all the three Thou shalt be scourg'd: for mockt, GOD will not be. I am resolved therefore, whatsoever May be the Consequent of my endeaver, Now to proceed in what he moves me to, And, I in duty am oblig'd to do; Because, though my Good will you should abuse, Your faults, my negligence would not excuse, Who, look for my reward (if any due) From him, whose work I do, and not from you. My first Memorials, in their Title page Hold forth an Emblematical presage, Besides much thereby verbally exprest (Relating to the plague which doth infest Your City now) which worth the observation May be, in every such like Visitation, And might have had, if heeded, good effects (Which have been lost by manifold neglects) And still may, were things better thought upon Which thereby, are advised to be done. But here, to adde that, will spend too much time, And therefore, I referring you to them, That, now will prosecute, which more then Reason Perswadeth me, is at this day in season. Your City, I have lov'd and honored, And, no less now, then heretofore I did, For, GOD hath made it, the most honour'd place That is within these Isles, or ever was; He hath inrolled, and renown'd her Name Among the Cities of the greatest Fame, That either are, or were below the Sun Since men to dwell in Cities first begun. Large Pledges, he upon her hath bestown Of his especial Love; some favour shown Vouchsaf'd to few of them; and such a measure Hath stored up in her, of his hid treasure, And intermixt, from time to time, so often Mercies and Judgements, hardned hearts to soften; So in Long-suffering, also doth persever (Though we are at this day, grown worse then ever) That I perceive in her a Seed and Root, Which to his Glory shall bring forth good Fruit In his due time; and this inclineth me To send these Memorandums now to thee, Intending in thy Sickness, here to stay Once more, when thy false-lovers fly away; And in, or near, thy borders, to remain Till GOD restores thee unto health again; Or, till by being quite deserted here, I shall be forc'd to seek my bread elsewhere; Of which I dreadless am. For, I depend Upon that powerful, and most faithful friend Who hath preserved me often since my birth, From worse things then War, Pestilence, &amp; Dearth. Physitians, and all else, who ere they are That, of Sick persons undertake the care, Do challenge, and ought also to assume (Though them, it may be it will misbecome At other times) a freedom to speak so And, and as occasion moves them thereunto, To act what's pertinent to their disease In way of Cure, although it may displease. I may, and do, as justly challenge now (Since neighbour like I mean to watch with you) Like Liberty; and will be bold to tell That which I know will help to make you well, Although, therewith displeas'd, you froward be, Harsh words for my good will return to me, And rage like those, who seem to loose their wits When they are in their Pestilential fits: For, I shall sober be, though somewhat sad, To see those, whom I would keep tame grow mad. And you I hope, what ere shall now be said Will patient be, when well my words are weigh'd. Consider well (for now high time it is, That you and all men should consider this) I say, consider how you have improved GOD's Mercy since his Judgments were removed; How, that provoking sinfulness abates, And that Abhomination which God hates: Nay well consider if it be not more Abhominable, then it was before. I fear it much, and ev'ry day this fear Increaseth by what I do see and hear; For, since I knew the world (which I have known And heeded, till an old man I am grown) I never heard this Nation so defam'd As now of late; and sins not to be nam'd By modest men, with so much impudence So often acted with so little sence Of manhood, nor with such impunity By persons of no vulgar quality. Both old and young men, high, low, rich and poor, Out acted have transgressors heretofore; Children are left so loose to speak and do What their corruption doth incline them to, (And ill example teach) that if their course Continue long, we shall at last grow worse Then Sodom and Gomorrah; which GOD knows I do not mention (as some may suppose) To scandalize this City or this Nation But to provoke them to a Reformation. To that intent, (so far forth as it shall Concern this City) speedily let all Who are in power, with prudence and in love The strength of their Authority improve Them to indulge and keep from violence, Whose conversations are without offence; And, by their executing of the Law In purity, strive to keep those in awe Who either shall malitiously transgress (By an infringment of the publick peace) Or wilfully commit, abet or teach What, of the Moral Law may be a breach. That nothing may by you be done unto Another, which you would not have him do To you, if in his case; search what you find, That may on you be charged, in that kind, And heartily repent it. That, moreover You may faults, which will else lye hid, discover; Consider, whether you have not with gladness Insulted over men opprest with sadness, Afflictions heaped up, upon Afflictions, Or, added Cruelty to due corrections, By seeking more to satisfie your Lust, Or Vengeance, then to execute what's just For Justice sake; or else, to please their Foes, Condemned Innocents, their lives to lose. Your waies examine, &amp; search out what crimes You have of late, more then in former times Been guilty of: As, whether you have been Or not, defiled with that scarlet sin, Which in times past your City did abhor, As being a peculiar heretofore Of that Malignant City, where the Whore Bestrides the Beast: be heedful also, whether It be not partly, or else altogether His work, to be in cruelties delighted; To see meek, honest, harmless men dispighted For Conscience sake; inhumanly exil'd Husbands from wives, the parent from the child Imprison'd to the loosing of their lives Their little Children, their beloved Wives, And their whole Families expos'd thereby To that unspeakable extremity Of wants and sufferings, which no flesh and blood Can bear, without immediate help from GOD. Whose will is thereby wilfully withstood. And why all this? not for transgressing Laws Of GOD or Nature, but alone, because These could not condiscend the world to please By an infringment of their consciences. Heed what this may deserve, if you desire To stop the Plague begun; lest else the fire Which may be kindled in your habitations, Do quite consume them ev'n to their foundations. For, GOD, of his Prerogatives is Jealous To vindicate all those he will be zealous Who suffer for his sake, although perchance They may be blamable through Ignorance, Or other, humane frailties; for where he Sees Faith and Love, their sins he will not see. As for their Persecutors, though he may His just Avengments, for a while delay, The patience of his people he doth mind, And, they who shew no mercy, none shall find. Examine, whether since you made your peace With GOD, the renovation and increase Of wilful sins deserved not renewing Of Plagues removed, and of worse ensuing. It is not without cause, that God now hath Such complicated Judgements, in his wrath On thee and thine inflicted, when grown great In hopes, thou thoughtst thy happiness compleat: Nor is it hidden from thee altogether For what sin, GOD sends this, or that plague hither. In truth, all Plagues are due unto each sin When with Impenitence, persisted in, Yet, frequently the ROD's wherewith we are Corrected, shew forth in Particuler What we offended in. For Superstition Was Gideons Family brought to perdition; King Davids pride, made manifest in him By numbring of the people) brought on them A Pestilence: GOD visited the earth For wilful breach of Covenants, with Dearth; And (as to Zedikiak and to Saul It did for that provoking sin befal) The chief offenders and their Children too, Stand liable to death for sinning so. Oppression, Cruelty and Idolizing The Creature (or things of our own devising) Have been chastiz'd with servitude and war, And, when Will-worshipings imposed are On others, with inhumane violence, Injustice acted with such impudence As Jezabels and Ahabs, rarely shall Such, scape from that, which did to them befal. But, when that Hipocrites, by lying hid As Annanias and Saphira did, (Till GOD discover'd them) may possibly Obscure the grouth of Infant Piety; When they, who Truths foundations overthrow, When, her malitious persecutors, grow So mighty, that the Saints unable are To calm them, or their furious rage to bear; Or, when Prophaness and Abhominations Like Sodoms, wholly, hath corrupted Nations Or Cities, till there shall appear in men Nor will nor power, them to reclaim agen; GOD, in such cases, to himself alone Assumes the punnishing of what's misdone And very frequently doth punish too, In such a mode as mortals cannot do: Sometimes, by Sudden Death, when they are in Their Jollity, or in the Act of sin; Sometimes, by sicknesses that long endure, Whereof no man can find the Cause or Cure; Sometimes, by that, which (till their provocation Of GOD) had been a means of preservation; Sometimes, they of their lives have been bereaven By Lightning, or by Thunderbolts from Heaven; And, otherwhile (struck with dispaireful fears) Are made to be Self-Executioners. This gives a Hint of that which more affords Then fully is expressed by my words To make it plain; but either thou, no doubt Or, some for thee, will search and find it out; Or, by the the searching after it, discern Somewhat, which thee as nerely will concern. Take heed of neighbours, and familiar friends, Who fawn upon thee for their own base ends, And love thee not, (though they respect profess By many shews of hearty friendliness) For, some of them, already cause have bin Of adding much both to thy Plagues and sin. But, specially, of thine own self take heed For, thence thy greatest dangers will proceed. Consider therefore, by thy self alone, What thou omitted hast, and what misdone; Whether thy folly, falsehood, fickleness, Apostacy from what thou didst profess, Falling from thy First Love, by mis-advice; Thy Luxury, thy sordid Avarice, Or, some vain hopes, deserv'd not deprivation Of that, whereof, thou hadst an expectation; Heed, whether, to have cured, or prevented One Plague, thy self thou hast not complemented Into a score; (at least, to stop one curse, Indanger'd drawing on thee many worse.) Observe, if ever Beggery and Pride; Did both together, upon one horse ride So frequently as now, through every street, Or walk so often on the self-same feet; And, whether mischiefs which at present fall On some, will not at last extend to all. Mind well what thou art doing; what is done; What is designed, but not yet begun; For what thou both with words and swords hast pleaded; What, thou hast most affected, or most dreaded, What thereon follow'd, or might have succeeded; What factions thou hast favor'd, and what still Wouldst favour, were thy power like thy will. London, if seriously thou ponderst this Thou wilt perceive that what succeeds amiss Flowes chiefly from thy self; and how can those Be friends to any who are their own foes? Thy Chiefs, care not how others they inslave, So, they themselves from servitude may save, Yet, these in fine, by that which doth befal Become to be the basest slaves of all, Ev'n Bondslaves to their Lusts, and to the Devil By getting an habitual love of evil. They hunt for honour, but, their fiery Title Will adde to them, less honour then a little. They covet to be rich; but wealth shall more Increase those wants and Lusts, that make them poor. In Policy and Powre, their trust is plac't Yet, they become dispised fools at last. Yea, we have seen those whom wealth, wit, and powre Supported, sink down breathless in one hour, That, we may know, there is an unseen hand Which oft strikes those, who without fear, may stand Of humane Justice, and beyond the reach Of Mortals: That, therefore, which this may teach Let all those heed, who, yet much heed it not: And, let them (by whom this is oft forgot) Remember ther's an all beholding eie, Which ev'ry secret purpose can espie; And, Angels alwaies ready at command, To execute what no powre can withstand; And such, as will for no bribe or respect, The prosecution of their charge neglect. Let likewise, those who most oppressed are Be taught hereby, still patiently to bear The Cross impos'd for trial of their Faith: (What ever, their oppressor doth or saith) In perseverance, let them still attend On GOD with meekness, till their Trials end. And leave all Carnal weapons, to their use Who, must be ruined by their abuse. I do presume, among you many are Who, to this wholesome Principle adhere, And, that if into practise carried on It shall both supersede the Plague begun And ev'ry other feared Plague prevent If timely they their other sins repent. For GOD, will winck at many faults in those Who love, and leave Revenge to his dispose; Yea, oftentimes experience we have had That, worse it makes things which before were bad, When through impatience we in our own mode, Attempt to do, what must be done by GOD. Or, our own suffering shall prolong (at lest) By our self-actings, when we do our best. This Pestilence, which now is brought in hither, I am assur'd, proceeds not altogether From Causes meerly natural, but comes To execute GOD's just deserved Dooms, From his immediate hand; and will therefore, Those Medcines need, which must do somewhat more To cure, or stay it from proceeding on, Then can be, by joint Art and Nature done. If you desire a Soveraign Antidote The best I know (if you neglect it not) Is metaphorically call'd Herb-grace, And will be very useful in this case; Some, term it Rue, because twill not begin To operate, until we Rue our sin. Take Rue and Reasons then, which signifie Repentance and Discretion; These apply As you find cause; which, if you do, and Fast From things that were offensive in times past, Keep from thenceforth a constant wholesome diet, And in your hearts endeavour to be quiet, My life for yours, GOD will your Souls deliver From ev'ry hurtful arrow in his quiver. Nor this, nor any Plague shall you anoy, Although as to the flesh, it should destroy; For, that can adde to mans loss or grief VVhose expectation is a better life. GOD, to this Pestilence hath joyned War, And Famine, seems not from us to be far; VVhich, if it now shall come will make the trouble VVe feel already, to be more then double, Because, our fellow feeling is no more Of what they suffer, whome these times make poor. For, such are our deportments, as if neither Sword, Pestilence and Dearth, put altogether Were no more, but an Army which did stand Arayed, to be at our own command, To execute our pleasures upon those, (Although our friends) whom we repute our foes. And therefore, have rejoyced when they seiz'd On them, with whom we highly were displeas'd. When, unto us, ill grounded hopes appear Whereby, of Mercies we presuming are; We are frollick, as if GOD did see Our gross Hypocrisies, no more then we. But, let men heed well whether, to acquire The Sequels which they naturally desire Is to insult when GOD corrects their foes, Or, censure his Intents concerning those Whom he Afflicts; as if for wrong to them It rather were, then for offending him: Or, as if sins to others onely known, Were more considerable then their own. There is observ'd, much Arragance and folly In some of thy Relations; from which wholly Thou for the time past, canst not cleared be; Therefore to keep from future scandal free, And also, for thy Credits reputation Take these Memento's to consideration. Consider, if it sober men befits To sing with Jollity about the streets Vain Triumph-Songs, when war is but begun As when a final Victory is won; Since tis well known, that many who at first Have thrived best, at last have thrived worst; And, that GOD justly suffereth sometime, (For Causes which are onely known to him) Those, more then once, before their foes to fall, Whose Cause he best approveth; and who shall Be conquerors at last: and that, where guilt Is equal, he lets blood be often spilt, And war prolongs, or maketh peace twixt them Who disagree, as they make peace with him. Therefore, when you are underneath the Rod, Remember, you are in the hands of GOD. When he hath crown'd your hopes with good success, Demean your selves with Christian Lowliness: For, when his Mercies much inlarged are, He doth expect a joyful filial fear: This, labour to preserve, lest else, the lack Thereof, may bring reversed Judgments back. Consider, whether Ships, Arms, men and horse, With policy united unto Force, Can prosper to th'advancement of their end, Who, upon those things, or themselves depend: Who, all their opposites as much dispise As if their Armies were but Gnats and Flies, Think to subdue them with jeers, mocks &amp; taunts, Puff up each other, with braggs, shameless vaunts, And lies devised by their foolish makers To keep from fainting Cowardly Partakers, Whose Consciences accusing them of guilt, (Because, their hopefulst Refuges are built On Quicksands) they become heart-sick with fear, As oft as any evil News they hear; And, on each slight Report of good success, Insteed of pious and meek thankfulness, Run to the Taverns (which are much more free To all, then pious Meeting places be) There, heathen like, nay rather more uncivil, Offer up Drink Oblations to the Devil. And, to chear up each others drooping Souls Sing songs between their glasses and their bowls; Or intermix Reports of what was won Or lost, though that was never said or done. Such Sacrificers, may find some effect In part, according to what they expect, But neither for their Faith or Righteousness; Nor will our hopes, longlasting be, unless Use, of the Common means for our defence, Be Sanctified by true confidence In GOD, and we with his known will comply, Bearing what ere betides us patiently; Improve each Favour and Deliverance, To somewhat which his Glory may advance; And whereby, they who are opprest and grieved May some way charitably be relieved: For, it is no beseeming Thank-Oblation For Mercies, when a City or a Nation Shall Solemnize it with but little else, Save Gunshot, Bonfires, Jangling of the Bells, Or, making others of their Joys partakers, Onely, in smoke and stinck, of Squibs &amp; Crackers; Or gathering rude throngs of men and boys, To make about those flames a barbrous noise, Which must be fed with fewel forc'd from some Who had none left to make a fire at home; Then drink healths to each other in the street Untill they cannot stand upon their feet, Or else loose their own healths: what thus to do Can wise men think it will amount unto But meer dispight of GOD, contempt of grace, And, throwing (as it were) durt in his face For, Benefits receiv'd; though they make shew As if they had return'd him all his due, When, they but please themselves, by doing that Whereby they sing their own Magnificat? What can be deemed a just recompence For such ingratitude, for an offence So foul, so capital, but that insteed Of future Blessings, Curses should succeed? London, heed this, and if thou wittingly Of such Prophaness and impiety Art guilty now, or hast been heretofore, Repent it, and henceforth, do so no more. But, herein, some will more concerned be Then thou art, yet, I mention this to thee With some hope, that, they will the less contem What's written here, because, not writ to them. Much more I have to adde, which I forbear Lest, I by adding more then thou canst bear With patience, may destroy what I design For this whole Nations welfare and for thine, By so displeasing thee, with what I write That, thou slight all whereto, I thee invite: For, though thy flattrers make thee to believe, Thou art in better case, then I conceive, Thy best friends know, that thine own provocations, Imprudency in some of thy Relations, (Ev'n of thy Watchmen) who should cures provide For thy distempers, are so giddifi'd, And, that their Eies, their Ears, yea and their brains (With every faculty which appertains To thy weal) are obstructed so, by fumings From their Self-seekings, &amp; their, high presumings, That thou art, by what these in thee have wrought Into an dangerous Consumption brought; For, thy decay of Trade, much hath increast Their Poverty who thereby are distrest: Thy hands and feet whose labour heretofore Supplyd thy wants, now, can do little more, Because, thy ablest members, by whom these Employd have been, partake of their disease: And, such Confusions daily do begin To multiply, and farther to break in, That, I am at a stand, what more to say Or, what on thy behalf, I ought to pray. Yet, one Expedient, I now think upon Whereby, it may be, somewhat will be done For they availe, if thou shalt not omit (As GOD inables) to endeavour it. And therefore, let that which I next express Be read, and minded with due heedfulness. In thee, are at this day, the chief Well-springs, Of all those good, and of those evil things Which throughout these three Nations are disperst; And of the Later, were the Stream reverst Or dam'd up at the Fountain; and, the first Set freely open here, it would become A Rivolet of Waters, flowing from That River, which through New-Jrrusalem His Currant hath, still issuing out of him Who, of those Living waters is the head VVhich through all Nations will at last be spread. And London, three times happy, shalt thou be If this Blest Fountain may break forth in thee, To sweeten ev'ry Cistern in these Lands, VVhich now, brimful of stincking water stands, And breed all these Infections in our Clime, VVhich are so baneful to us, at this time. There is a possibility of this If we our parts do, as GOD hath done his; Or, but endeavour so to co operate With him, as he enables us, in that Which he requires (thereto vouchsaving still Assistance to our deeds, and to our will.) By this Compliance, that New Heaven and earth VVhich is expected, would ere long come forth; And Righteousness, then from thy habitations As amply flow out, thorow all these Nations As wickedness doth now; or heretofore It did, when ill examples made it more. This Change, more happiness would hither bring Then, when in triumph thou broughtst in the King, And of rejoicing, give more cause by much, Then we shall have when we do beat the Dutch, And are from dread of that delivered too, VVhich some suspect the French intend to do; Yea, and from what, more dangers threats then either Of those two singly, or both joyn'd together: Ev'n from those, which are possible to come From Factiousness, and Male contents at home. But this Joy will encrease, and all our fears Abate, when men do more incline their ears To what's proclaimed by those Trumpeters VVhom GOD reserved, to make proclamation Of that, which most concerns this Generation; And, when the Influences of GOD's graces By supreme persons, and by powerful places Shall not obstructed be, as we have seen Of late, and as they very long have been, By Antichristian wiles; and those through whom They are more dangerous to us become, Because their formal piety makes showes To be for him, whom, chiefly they oppose. Thou art abused by misinformations, Not thou alone, but likewise these three Nations By those Mintmasters of untruths and lies, Who cheat the whole world with their fallacies, Yea, much dis-serviced, dishonor'd too, Is he, to whom, they yet pretend to do Good services; and they by their Deceits, Have him reduced unto may Streights Which will destroy him, ere he is aware, Unless, GOD shall unsnarle him from their snare; And, in what misbefals, thou wilt have share. To take my counsel, then, think it no shame, (Although, a poorer man then he I am Who sav'd a City; for, a Mouse may gnaw That snare asunder, which, nor Lions paw Nor teeth can break. Go, quickly, quickly lay Your Skarlet Gowns, and your gold chains away; Fast, watch and pray; do as King David did; (When he the pestilential Angel spide) Of somewhat, unto GOD an offring make Which is thine own; that he a gift may take Made acceptable, by, and in his son, To stay the Plague, which newly is begun. Shut up your selves awhile, and throw aside Your factiousness, your malice and your pride; Lust, Avarice, and them with ev'ry Sinn Whereby the wrath of God provok'd hath been. Fall down before his feet with humbleness, Your misdeeds, with true penitence confess, Especially, those crying sins, whereby You often have insenst his Majesty. Among which, no crime can offend him more Then when you shall (as Cain did heretofore) Destroy your bretheren, because, to GOD They dare not sacrifice in such a mode, As they believe he neither doth command Nor takes, with good acceptance, from their hand. Your Priviledges, they do not invade By violence; but, lovingly perswade To what they do believe, promoteth best Gods glory, and the Publick Interest. Be thou as charitable unto them; Leave that to God alone, which unto him Alone belongs; when he into the Land Hath cast his seed, permit the Crop to stand Till harvest time, &amp; pluck not that away, Which looks like wheat, though it may prove but Ray But, weed out that alone, which ev'ry one Knows hurtful to the Corn, and will be none. Thus, having way prepar'd to make your peace, With GOD, in Faith and Love emplore his Grace. This being done; the next work, which to do Thou art, as I believe, oblig'd unto, Is to improve the powre thou hast in him Who over all these Islands is supream, And with whom, thou dost in more favour stand Then any other City of this Land. Whilst his esteem of thee, doth seem to last (And ere fit opportunities are past) Unto his Royal Throne make thy Address, Emplore him, with deliberate advice, To hear and heed that, without prejudice Which may in season, offred be by them Who fear God, and both love and honour him, With an intent to serve him faithfully, Without selfends in ev'ry thing, whereby Their services shall really consist With GOD's, with his, and with their Interest, For whose sake, he originally gave All those Prerogatives that Princes have. For, though men so unbiassed, may dare To speak some Truths which all men cannot bear, (When cause requires) they will with moderation So heed what tendeth to the preservation Of common peace, and of the dignity Belonging to his royal Majesty, (Whom God hath honor'd by restoring him Unto his Predecessors Diadem) That, neither he, nor they, nor I, nor you, Shall have cause, to dislike what will ensue. If you believe this, and endeavour so To prosecute it, as you, may yet do, Who knows, what he, who hath the hearts of Kings (And the disposing of all other things VVithin his powre) will do, although this may Proposed seem, in a dispised way. Tis an adventer, which though partly lost VVill bring in some return, that's worth the cost: And those streights (if well heeded) wherein he This City, and all these three Kindoms be Adventrers needs, and somewhat to be done VVhereof, no likelihood is yet begun. For, that which must draw order from confusions, To our Destractions, timely, put conclusions, And, so, divine and civil pow'rs unite That, neither, may infring each other right, Effected cannot be, by hauty words, By Policy, or temporary swords, Nor by that Formal Sanctity with which The Grand Impostors of this world bewitch Deluded souls (that all things may become Subjected to their Arbitarry Doome) But by such Instruments and by such waies, As those, by which Christ did begin to raise His Kingdom at the first; and by which here It shall continue untill he appear With that powre, which shall batter &amp; beat down, More Idol Temples then were overthrown. Since his first coming; and, root out all those Idolatries, which out of them arose; Together with the Thrones of all those Kings, That are partakers in such worshippings, And made drunk with her Cup who rides the Beast; The Subjects of his Kingdom, have opprest, And shall oppress them without penitence, For provocations, by that great offence. More might be said, but, this shall now suffice; “GOD make us all unto salvation wise, “Preserve us in his love, so knit together “That we in his love may preserve each other; And, that all we can think, or say, or do May now, and in the close, conduce unto The glorifying of his holy Name Though to our selves, it may occasion shame. Amen. A Warning-Piece to London, Discharged out of a Loophole in the Tower during the Authors Close imprisonment there. It was meditated upon the deplorable consuming of an eminent Citizen with his whole Family, in the night, by a sad and suddain Fire, at the beginning of our most Joyful Festival, in Decemb. 1662. The Author conceived, that it would better stir up the hearts of some, by being sung, then Read: Therefore, he composed it in Lyrick Verse, fitted to the Tune of the Lamentation, at the end of the singing Psalms, if the last Strain of that Tune shall be repeated with the two last lines in every Stanza. [1] VVake London wake, Fast, watch, and pray, Well heed likewise this Warning-song; To eat and drink, rise up and play, Hath been thy daily practise long: Oh! from henceforth, remember more, Thy Brethren, whom oppressors grieve; Refresh the fick, relieve the poor; For none without good works believe. If hardly sav'd the Righteous are Ah! how shall wilful sinners fare? 2 The Rich man, heedlesly discerns The near approaching day of wrath, To fill his Warehouse and his Barnes, Is all the present care he hath. At large, he preparation makes For offerings to his Belly God, Till Justice an occasion takes To mixe those offrings with his blood; When fools in folly most delight, They, often, loose their Souls that night. 3 Our Love is cold, nigh ripe our sin, And, in their march, GOD's Judgments be; At his own house they do begin; Then, from them, who shall now be free? To make us thereof take more heed, One house they singled out of late, And, in a bright flame-colour'd weed, Upon the top thereof they sate And when to sleep they laid their heads, Consum'd her dwellers in their beds. 4 Why should not each man to whose ear This news was in the morning brought, Upon himself reflect with fear, Thus, thereon musing, in his thought? LORD, this unlook'd for stroke of thine, Hath often been deserved by me; This sad mishap might have been mine This night, had it so pleased thee; But, (praised be thy holy name) Here, yet alive, and safe I am. 5 Oh with what terrors, were they stroke How sadly were they discompos'd, To find themselves when they awoke With stifling fumes, and flames inclos'd? It made their terror much the more, If to remembrance they did call What they had done, awhile before, And, what so quickly did befal. More dreadful it appears to me, Then Dungeons, Racks, and Halters be. 6 Thus will they fare, when his last Doome To pass on sinners, Christ appears; Thus, in a moment, he will come, When least the world his coming fears. Thus, whether then her heedless heart Is either sleeping or awake, Surprized with a suddain start, They shall with horrid terrors quake, When they behold with sad amaze, All things about them in a blaze. 7 Unless my thoughts misdictate me, A secret Judgment, in this Act, May doubtlesly discerned be To shew GOD's hand was in the fact. For, though his waies are in the dark, Forth from the Cloud, a flashing breaks To shew us, (if we such things mark) His purpose, by the Course he takes. In darkness he hath perfect Light, And all mens deeds are in his sight. 8 But, though this Judgment be severe, Let not us who escape it, ween Them, greater sinners then we are; But, judg what our deserts have been. Christ doom'd not those whom Pilat slew As more to blame, then other men, Though with their blood he did imbrew, That, which they sacrifized then; And of those persons judg'd as well, On whom the Towre of Silo fell. 9 Hereof, small sense have carnal men; This, for sad news, at Noon they tell, Return unto their sins agen, And sleep next night at brink of hell: That, which concerns their safety most, As quickly slips out of their mind As letters written in the dust, Blown out with ev'ry puff of wind. Of others harms, how senseless grown Are they, who do not mind their own? 10 This came to pass within thy walls, That, thou mightst thereof take good heed, Mind, who thereby upon thee calls, And think, what further may succeed: It was not from those places far, Where much to be, thou dost delight, That thou shouldst heed thy dealings there; And, it befel there in the night, That, thou, a stricter watch maist keep: For Sathan wakes, when men do sleep. 11 Hereof, likewise, let heed be took, That, when thy heart was most supine, This Judgment, in upon thee broke, Amidst thy Musick, mirth and wine; And, that, unless for sin thou mourn, Relieve and comfort men distrest, Thy Feasts, to Fastings GOD will turn, And, smite thee when thou fearst it least. When Sodom sinned without shame, Down thereon, Fire and Brimstone came. 12 The Drowned world, was warn'd of old Of what would in short time befal, By Words and Doeeds it was foretold, Yet unregarded still by all. They married and in marriage gave, Did eat and drink, as we do now, Did so, the wrath of GOD outbrave, And, as we, liv'd they car'd not how: But, lo, when in least awe they stood, Out break the Deeps, in came the Flood 13 Thou, LONDON, whosoe're doth weep, Dost, on thy Viol, play and sing; Thy Children, daily revel keep, Ev'n when their Passing bells do ring. Themselves on costly Beds they streach, Regarding not how Joseph fares; To them, who of Repentance preach They listen, but with Adders ears. And, well he speeds, who shall be heard, If mischiefs be not his reward. 14 In sixteen hundred ten and one, I, notice took of publick Crimes, With mine own faults, I first begun; Observ'd the Changes of the Times: And, what GOD had on me bestown Employed for the Common good; Therein, I sought to find mine own, Which, was so oft misunderstood, That I, for being so employd, Have been three times, nigh quite destroyd. 15 In sixteen hundred twenty five, When thou wert sick, I watcht by thee; Then, did my First Forewarning give, And, this perhaps, my last must be. For, now, my Tools away are took, Some things half wrought, some but begun; Quite being rob'd of alll my stock, Concludes my work, before tis done; And that Flesh Ragg, by me yet worn, May soon drop off, or, off be torn. 16 Here, I yet live, where, what me grieves, But few of thine, have heeded much; Nor Mayors, Aldermen, or Sheriffs Or any noble, great or rich; But, in Long-suffrings being old, (If not relived by the poor) By sickness, hunger, or by cold Death had ere now, unlockt my door. Lest thou as much neglected be, Think more on GOD, though less on me. 17 My Publick warnings, are supprest, As once, was Jeremiahs Roll; Which GOD, will when he sees it best, Revive, with an inlarged Skroll: Meanwhile, by stifled musings tir'd, The flames within me closly pent, Like powder in Granado's fir'd, Do tear my heart, through want of vent, And crack my earthen vessel more Then all my suffrings heretofore. 18 Within thy West and Eastern Jail. Now twice ten months confind I've lain, Denied both Relief, and Bail, Which Law allows, and Rogues obtain: To tell, what others did, or said, Is thought in me a grand misdeed, Though being of their harms afraid, I did but bid my friends take heed: If this be falls for words well ment, Woe to ill deeds, with ill intent. 19 Alas! how apt are we to fear, Or fancy danger, where is none? Yet how unapt, how loth to hear, What may prevent a certain one? Except propounded in their mode, Who, in their own conceit are wise, The Counsels both of Men and GOD They, either frustrate, or dispise: Which being well weigh'd, is a signe, That, to destruction they decline. 20 Seaven daies before the late sad night, Thy Prætor, seized in my hands What GOD inclined me to write, For timely warnings to these Lands; So, that, which to their weal conduc'd, Hath hitherto been fruitless made; And, I more strictly have been us'd, Though, I before, hard measure had. But, GOD, by whom it was begun, Will gard me, till my work is done. 21 No more seems now within my powre, But, down to lie, beneath my Lode, Attending my Redemption hour, With patient waiting on my GOD. Yet, there is hope, that Prayers may To what is feared stoppage put; And, since, to Heaven ther's open way, (Though from the world, I close am shut) As Jonas did (when in a Whale; Close prisoner kept) to God ile call. 22 Correct us LORD, but not in wrath, Purge rather, what misdone hath been, By any temporary Death, Then by correcting sin with sin, For all the blood that hath been spilt, Let us, who think our selves most clear, In private, search out our own guilt, And, wherein else, we faulty are, That, by a self-condemning Doom, We may escape the wrath to come. 23 Preserve thy Church, Lord, bless the King And, seeing thou hast him restor'd, Him, out of all his troubles bring, And, make his will, with thine accord, That under his Protection here, We, without faction, hate or strife, (In all uprightness, without fear) May live a sanctified life, And, he indulge the Conscience tender, As best becomes, the Faiths Defender. Thus, on what lately did befal, I sung my Musings, to the wall, Which gave thereto, as much regard As most will, when abroad tis heard: For, little have such lines as these, Which may a Carnal pallat please. The wanton huggs a wanton strain, The miser, that which treats of Gain; Ambitious men give most applause To that, which their, Ambition claws; In lies and follies, fools delight, And, if this ever come to sight, It will by none, be relish'd well Save those, with whom the Graces dwell. The more Precautions are in season, (The more agreeable to Reason) Their Rage it will the more increase, Who are inclined to oppress; And, if I die not in this place, It will be meerly of GOD's grace, To make it known, the Rage of man, Is bounded, do the worst he can. These Musings, and some other too, Escap'd surprize, with much ado, And, that whereof I was bereft Me, for awhile in sadness left; Yet, much more sorrowful am grown For others sakes, then for mine own, Because, the world so misbefriends, What to her own well being tends. God, never any Place bereaves Of saving means, till him it leaves; Nor is their any man quite lost, Till he resists the holy Ghost. He, helpless leaves no willing one In acting what he would have done; But, when to selfness, man adheres Then, as he worketh, so he fares. GOD, gives first motion to each wheel, In motion also, keeps it still, If he with him Compliance feel, Else let's it go which way it will. Thus he will do, and thus hath done, Ev'n ever since the world begun. That, men his works and mind might mark, He preach'd by Noah and his Ark, And, to prevent their threatned doom Allow'd them sixcore years to come. That, Sodom timely might repent, He, Lot to be exemplar sent; When Balam misaffected was He made a Preacher of his Ass; And by a Whale, he Jonas sent To bid the Ninevites repent, Who, more thereto inclined were Though heathens, then most Christians are. What did to Israels weal belong, He gave by Moses in a song, That, when Records could not be had, They, thereof mindful might be made. When their Transgressions were nigh full, To Babel they were sent to school; Since which time, they still growing worse (Till they incur'd Cains dreadful Curse, For shedding of their brothers blood, Who died zealous of their good) Them, out of their good land, GOD hurl'd, To rovee like him about the world; Depriv'd (now sixteen hundred years) Of Prophets and Remembrancers: And, in this mode, with ev'ry Nation God deals, e're final Reprobation. LORD! from their wandrings call them home; Into thy fold, back let them come. We got advantage by their fall Let it increase by their Recall. Since they, and we in ev'ry sin, Have Paralels, a long time been, Let our joint force, henceforth be spent To move each other to repent, That, they and we may in that Place, Become Partakers of thy Grace, Where Jews and Gentiles shall be saved, By our Redeemer, and thy David. By wiser men, in times of old, Much was exprest, which I have told, And, they have both in Prose and Rimes, Forewarnings given in their times; Declar'd in season, how GOD deals With wicked Realms and Common-weals. Our own Records likewise declare GOD's frequent dispensations here; How constantly, avenging wrath In ev'ry Age pursued, hath The greatest Tyrants in their turns, Though sometimes, he their doom adjourns. But, that, no just excuse will be Either, to other men, or me, If we shall negligently do What, GOD inclines our hearts unto, And may, now, or in future daies Advance mans welfare, and God praise. For, on us lieth Obligations, To bring forth in our Generations, VVhat needful seems to be exprest; In such a manner also drest As best that Ages temper fits In which we live, and best begets A timely heed, in those to whome VVe serviceable would become: Yea, we to them must hand it too; Else, lamely, we our duties do. Thus, I according to my powre Have done, and therefore kiss the Towre From whence, I send this Warning-shot By Ammunition hardly got. LONDON, as Moses gave a song to be Israels MEMENTO, I give this to thee; To shew, that (though the world doth me deprive Of what was hers) I somewhat have to give Which I by GOD's free grace, may call mine own, And, is not needlesly on thee bestown. But, e're some change, the means thereof bereave, Now, both of Friends and Foes, Ile take my leave; Adue my Foes; for often, by event, You did me good, though none to me you ment. To pray for you, I know, I am your debter, And, therefore so I do; GOD, make you better, And so to mark and mind what he intends, That, we may in his Love, henceforth be friends. My friends, farewel; and no whit grieved be Though you should me no more in Babel see, For, at the Holy Lambe, we safe shall meet, E're long, in New Jerusalems high street. Written in the Towre 1662. [The meek, and humble to advise] The meek, and humble to advise I write; but not to teach the wise. You must not therefore, here expect, Such Strains as these times best affect; For, you may have enough of those By others writ, in verse and prose. A SINGLE SACRIFICE, Humbly offred to Almighty GOD, by the Author during his lonely Confinement in the Towre, to mediate his gratious preventing the Dearth feared, and probably portended, by immoderate Rains in June and July, 1663. That he with Tools might for this work be fitted, His Jailer, and his Keeper, he outwitted; For, twas his greatest suffring, to be pent From means, to give such meditations vent. Sin, like the Ocean (but, not so well bounded) These Islands hath on ev'ry side surronded, And, many Breaches, lately made it hath Which to the furious Tempests of GOD's wrath Exposeth us (ev'n quite throughout these Lands) So, that, Hills, Dales, and all in danger stands. The Air, whose cloudy brow, upon us lowrs, Dissolves it self, into destructive showrs, To move us unto tears of penitence By feeling that, whereof we have no sense. For, they, who are most sensible of spoyl (by Rains or Droughts) of corn, and wine and oyl, Feel not in heart, the least remorce for sin; But, when they should bewail it, laugh and grin. They, who are very froward, and repine If they loose but their monky or their swine, (And, sometimes vex them selves till they are sick, For losses, not amounting to a Chick) And can with many bitter tears, bemone Small suffrings, for their greatest sins shed none. In mine own person, I much need not fear Such temporary Plagues, as threatned are By Rain or Winds, by cold, or scortching wether, By suddain floods, or fires; for, I have neither Estate to lose, nor hope of getting ought Which, by such things, may be in hazard brought; And, am at present, with my daily bread, By his own hand, miraculously fed, Whose All-sufficiency, should me sustain Though all the world were to be drown'd again. External things, are little pertinent To my chief safety, or my best content: For, should a Famine; me of life bereave Death would be more advantage then to live A life like mine; and as I have been us'd, A speedy death, is rather to be chus'd. Yet, whilst, I may be serviceable made To him, from whom, this life at first I had, I am content to live till it expires, Although it were in stormes, in floods or fires; And, likewise, am so sensible of that Which to the Common welfare doth relate, That up to GOD a prayer Ile prefer To crave prevention of what many fear: For, though I am not suffred to present A prayer to King, Lord, or Parlement; Here, to GOD's Throne I free access have got, And he doth hear me when men hear me not: Of which assured, in this loneliness, My self to him, I humbly thus address. Almighty and most merciful Creator, Of heaven and earth, of fire, of aire and water, With whatsoe're, consists of forme or matter, Of all invisible, or to be seen, Of all that is or shall be, or hath been, Felt, heard or understood (excepting Sin, At whose birth all Privations did begin.) Thou, by whose wisdom all the whole Creation, Is ordred, and hath still a preservation, Make acceptable in thy sight, I pray, What I shall meditate or write this day And, let not my Requests be flong away, Though we have often forfeited again That Grace, which we did heretofore obtain, And liable to all thy plagues remain. We must confess, that in these last three years, Thou hast abated many of our fears, For thine own sake, and for the sakes of them, Whom thy blaspheamers and their Foes contemn. Awhile ago, we were surpriz'd with dread Of hunger, and the scarcety of bread, By such distemper'd seasons, as foreshew'd That Chastisement which here, is now renew'd; And, was remov'd, ere many had much sense, Of what some felt, or of their own offence. Once, we were frighted with such sicknesses As seem'd forerunners of the worst disease; And, till this hour, a brutish Discord, Keeps us in daily hazard, that the Sword Will be again unsheath'd: yea, though we are Preserved still, from what we justly fear, And that, thy patience might be more disern'd, Have year, by year, been gratiously forewarn'd (By Signes and wonders probably foreshewing, The sad events, that seem to be pursuing Our crying sins) yet, we do ne're the less, Continue still in our obduratness. Though, much Instruction, likewise, we have had, Examples, Premonitions, publick made, And extraordinary Dispensations, To draw us, from our wilful aberrations, We so increase them, that, it renders me, Exceeding fearful to Petition thee, Those Temporary Judgments to withdraw Whereof, we at this present, stand in aw, Lest they, whom no good counsel mollifies Thy Justice and thy Mercy quite dispise; And fall into that Reprobated sense, Which brings unchangeable Impenitence: For, that, the Consequence hath often proved, When Plagues before Repentance were removed. The fields were lately cloth'd beyond our hope With an appearance of a fruitful crop, Which moisture by unseasonable showrs, So evidently, by degrees, devours That, most men are afraid the teeming Earth Insteed of Plenty, wil produce a Dearth; And, they among us, who do most neglect Removal of the Cause, most dread th'effect. Yet, humane pitty, me doth so incline To make the Common fear, a part of mine, That, though I am not likely much to gain Or loose thereby, whether it shine or Rain, I, (as I am a man) well pleas'd could be Thy Peoples votes, might be vouchsaf'd by thee. To that intent, I meekly do assay To mediate; but, now I come to pray, That Spirit whose assistance is expected, Withdraws, as if my suite would be rejected; So, that I know not how to speak or write, What gain thy gratious acceptation might Through fear, my prayers may be turn'd to sin, Considering, what Postures we are in. For, who, the pleading of their Cause dares own, On whom, a righteous King doth justly frown? They being Rebels too, in whom appears No penitence, but onely slavish fears? Who, conscientiously, can pray for them Who persevere all Justice to contemn? Who turn away their eies, when thou forth sendst Foretokens, of what thou for sin intendst? Who hide them too, so far forth as they may From other men; or, (if that fails) assay To misinterpret them, when they do see The things nor hid, nor disapprov'd can be? Who, can with Faith, thy Grace for them implore, Who, are unmerciful unto the poor? Who, daily to thy burning wrath add fewel? Who, both to others, and themselves are cruel? Who, their afflicted Brethren to dispaiers Expose? close up their ears against their prayers? And most injuriouslys with those men deal? Who, most endeavour, to advance their weal; Yea, for whose sakes it is, that they are not Destroy'd like Sodom, when thou caldst forth Lot? Who, are so far, from striving to be better, That still, to hide one sin, they act a greater, Till they on one another heap so many That they have little shame, or sense any; Although their impudent abhominations Have their Infection spread, through all these Nations? LORD! who, on their behalf, can mediate For any of those Blessingss which relate Unto their temporary weal alone, Who, of their Brethrens welfare, care have none? Who, do employ their powre, but to oppress? Turn all thy Graces into wantonness? Fling, as it were defiance against heaven? And, though by thee, they freely were forgiven Innumerable debts, (and likewise are By thee inrich'd more then before they were) Take ne're the less, their fellows by the throat, VVho owing them not much more then a Groat, Forbearance crave, and at their feet do fall, With, promise, when they can, to pay them all? VVhat can such look for; but to be bereaven Of that Grace, whereby they were once forgiven Their debts; or think deserv'd, but, to be laid In chains, till ev'ry farthing shall be paid? VVho, can to thee be Advocate for those VVho, both to Truth and Righteousness, are foes, Though they profess both? who, though ever learning, Can never get the knowledg &amp; discerning Of what pertains to th'essential Truth, Because, they being all EAR, or all MOUTH, Neither hear willingly, or speak of ought VVhereby they may to stedfastness be brought? But rather itch to hear, and speak, and do That, which their own self-will doth prompt them to: And, was infus'd into them by false teachers, Whom they suppose to be the soundest Preachers, VVhen they confirm them, in what doth belong To their will-worship, be it right or wrong; And keep up those Diana's, which were made Their Goddesses, but to uphold their Trade? These, twixt Beleevers, do contests maintain For Trifles, which tend more to their own Gain Then Godliness, or those means to increase Which may conduce to setlement of peace, In Christian Charity, and Righteousness. All, I (with hope to speed) can pray for such Is, that they may not love the world too much; Or, by hypocrisie, and lip professions, (To get themselves a share in her possessions) Obstruct the blessed work of Reformation By Factions, to the final extirpation Of all those Dispensations, which have yet Some use; and which, whilst thou dost them permit, They to advance thy Glory may improve: And, by sincerely seeking Truth in Love, So exercise thy Graces, whilst those last, That, they will perfect be, when their times past. My GOD, for these, to this effect I may And, do (I know) with thy allowance pray; Because, I hope, tis no malitious pride Which hath to Selfness, drawn their hearts aside. But, as for them, who have inclinde their ears So long time, to ungodly Counsellers, So persevered, in the sinners way, And, therein with delight, so long made stay That, to the Scorners Chair advanc'd they are, Resolving with themselves to settle there; The Dictates of thy holy ghost contemn, Absolve the wicked, Innocents condemn, Term evil, good, the best things evil call, (Or, make twixt them no difference at all) Ascribe thy Attributes unto the Devil And his Vicegerent; make thee, of all evil Prime Author; Thee detrude out of thy Throne To set their Idol, and themselves thereon; Pervert the lawful use of ev'ry Creature, Till their depraving the whole humane nature For Vengeance calls, and as it were, inforces Thy Justice to turn Blessings into Curses; What can be spoke for these, to save them from Thy Judgments here, or in the world to come? I cannot, LORD, thy mercy comprehend, Nor know how far their malice doth extend, Such things, are knowable to thee alone; Therefore, concerning these, thy will be done. The best of us have gone astray so far, In Provocations, that, perhaps here are Now, very many in the state of those For whom, we are forbid to interpose Our mediations betwixt them and Thee, As touching Judgments, that now threanned be: Such, ev'n among thy People heretofore, Made thee forbid a Prophet to implore Withholding of those Plagues, which at that time, Were threatned to be hurled down on them. Yea then, though thy choice worthies should have pleaded. That, thy Decree might have been superseaded, Thou didst resolve, their suite should not be heard For any, save themselves, with good regard. When sins grow ripe, and Scandalous become, They seldom scape a temporary doome, Though thou vouchsafest mercy, as to David Whereby, the Souls that sinned, shall be saved. LORD, though that growth, our Guilt attaineth hath, Alway remember mercy, in thy wrath. Some such like Barr, and prohibition now, From thee is issued forth, for ought I know. Alas! if so; what possibly can we Endeavour, till it shall reversed be? Or else dispens'd with? I can never pray With confidence, for what suspect I may Is not precarious: And, as qualifi'd We are, things grantable may be deni'd, At least, so long time, as that shall be wanting Which makes the chief condition of their granting. Tis not a slavish terror (without Love And faithful Penitence) that will remove The Plagues that lie upon us; or prevent A Threatned Judgment, when 'tis imminent. Tis not wil worshippings, though much applauded, By their approvers, and by them begawded With Superstitious Dressings, that can please Thy Majesty, and thy just wrath appease: Tis not our formal whinings, or Orations, Or, our Confessions, or our Deprecations, Or, Bablings with the Tongue, without a heart That, will thy threatned Judgments quite divert, Till thou hast done thy work which is in hand, Or, till we more conform to thy command; Whereto, perhaps, that, which we fear, may more Conduce, then that, which we to scape implore. For, few do conscience of their duties make Much longer, then the Rod is on their back. Yet, somewhat, makes me hopeful, that thou hast Against what I would ask, no sentence past; And, fain would I obtain from thee, this day, A Publick Blessing, e're I go away, Which might in some degree, abate the dread Whereby, now, many are distempered. To thee, thy Children for a Blessing cry Upon those Fruits, which drench'd in waters lie; And (though unworthy) Jacob like, I am Resolv'd with thee, to wrestle for the same. Let, not my LORD, be wrath, that I go on To prosecute the suite I have begun; For, I with filial fear approach thy Throne. Direct us, how in this, and such like cases, We may make acceptable our Addresses, Lest, we grow overwhelmed with dispairs, Or, come with over peremptory Prayers: For, somewhat thou, at all times, hast to grant To comfort those, who consolation want, When they are sensible of their condition, And come before thee with unfaind contrition. Yea, though, when we are outwardly distrest, We may not absolutely make request For what seems needful; yet, when we resigne In all our sutes, our own will unto thine, Our wants (if in particular deni'd) Are with a Fatherlike respect suppli'd Some other way, by mercifully granting A better thing, then that, which we thought wanting. For, thou, till he himself shall bar the door, Excludest no mans prayre, who doth implore In Faith and Charity, that, which may tend To give him, a well-being without end. Of this, experiment I oft have had, And, me thou confident thereof hast made. This Creed, thou hast been pleas'd to teach me, LORD, Both by thy holy spirit, and thy word, Confirming my experience day by day, That, I to other men declare it may, As I in duty, am oblig'd to do, When thou my heart inclinest thereunto. And, by thy favour, now proceed I can In that, which, when these musings I began, I neither able was to prosecute, As I intended; or commence my sute, In terms, which I could think fit to present To thee; or, to my self, could give content. But, now the Bars remov'd and I can make A shift to Stammer, what I could not speak. By thy Assistance likewise, I believe That, what I now shall pray for, thou wilt give; Ev'n ev'ry thing (implicitly at least) Which shall in this my Prayer be exprest: I, therefore, in thy sight, now spread abrode My private meditations, in this mode; And hope, it shall be spread, where many may Add their Amen to that, for which I pray: And, that their joyning in this my Oblation, Will gain us all shares in thy acceptation. Oh! I should then sing, with a Joyful heart LORD, let thy servant, now, in peace depart. That Everlasting Gospel make more known, By which, thy Love eternal is forth shown To all mankind; and which, a glorious throng Of Angels, publish'd in a Joyful song, (Unto the glory of thy blessed Name) When first thy Son aray'd with flesh became; That, all the world may know, the same Goodwill Which thereby was exprest, continues still: And, that, Desire to know both Good and Evil, Proceeded from our Selves, and from the Devil, But, not from thee, who, didst intend Salvation To Adam, and to all his Generation; Not reprobating any of his Race Save such as wilfully dispis'd thy Grace, And, justly, caused the product of that Which, thou didst never prenecessitate. Thy Love to all mankinde, compels me oft (Though for it, I maligned am, and scoft) To preach it to the world, that, men may more Mind it with thankfulness, then heretofore. I know this Truth is own'd, ev'n among those VVho, unto thee are yet, apparent foes; And, that, hath hindreth many to embrace The Doctrine of thy Universal Grace, Because, they are not heedful, that, unless These held some Truths with that unrighteousness VVhich they maintain, not many would believe That Mistery, by which they do deceive. But, to prevent their wiles, unclose their eies, VVho cannot yet perceive their fallacies; And let it be made manifest to them VVho do not wilfully the means contemn, VVhich, thou vouchsafed unto all men hast, And alwaies wilt, at first, or at the last. Let that large mercy, our hearts work upon, More then thy Judgments hitherto have done; To which intention, let thy Saints improve That Influence which thy Eternal Love Hath shed on them, to work throughout this Nation By Love and Gentleness, a Reformation; Which will be then more speedy, and sincere Then that, which is compel'd, &amp; wrought by fear. Preserve that pretious seed, sown in this Land; Now, many Ages past, by thine own hand; It hath been often watred by the Blood Of thy Elect; hath many Storms withstood, And took such root, that, now it doth extend By sev'ral Branches, to the worlds far end. Permit it not to suffer diminution Either by calms, or storms of Persecution. Let not the lofty Cedars over-top it, The wild-swine root it up, or tame-beast crop it; Nor weeds or brambles (among which it grows) Starve it, or choak it; nor the greedy Crows Devour it; nor the swarms of Locusts, which In smoke, ascended from th'infernal Ditch; But, let it, when appearing most opprest, Palm-like, most thrive, and be the more increast, Till th'earth it fills; and till up rooted be All plants, that were not planted there by thee. This, I first pray for Lord, because possessing Hereof, doth lay the ground of ev'ry blessing. Correct thou not these Nations in thy wrath, But, in that measure, which shews mercy hath An intrest in thy Justice. Let them hold The same proportion which they did of old, In thy severest chastisements; that, neither Both Good and Evil, be destroy'd together, Nor, their hopes thereby vacated, by whom There is a Kingdom look'd for, yet to come. Five wicked Cities might have spared been, Had twice five, Righteous men been found therein: Yea, Thou (although in them there was but one) Defer'dst their dreadful doom till he was gone. LORD, I hope, here are many thousands yet, On whom thy Seal, on whom thy Mark is set. Who trust in thee, whose faith doth not yet fail; Who, their own, and the Nations guilt bewaile: For their sakes, lay aside thy wrath again; Let thy Sun shine, and let thy Clouds drop Rain Both on the just and unjust, as thou hast Been pleased to vouchsafe in Ages past; That, Spring and Summer, Seed and Harvest-times Untill the world shall end, may in all Climes Be from each other still distinguished, As long ago, by thee was promised. At this time also, to this sinful Nation, Extend thy wonted favour &amp; compassion, By blowing hence those clouds, whose frequent showrs Spoil not alone grass herbs and pleasant flowers, But, threaten also, to destroy those crops, Whereby the painful husband-man hath hopes To be rewarded for his toil and cost; Yea, let this Isle, which now despairs almost, Of such a blessing, be secured from That Famine, which we are afraid will come. Both of our Earthly, and thy heavenly bread, Preserve the means, that therewith being fed, In soul and body, we may for the same In flesh and spirit magnifie thy Name Till Christ shall come. Continue in this place, The special pledges, of thy special Grace, Close up those Rents, which malice hath made wide; Unite by Love, those whom self-will and Pride Have dis-united: For, thy Love was that Which made thee at the first, this world create; And, 'tis the same essential Love (by thee In thy Elect made active) which must free The world again, from that confus'd estate Whereto 'tis brought by Envy and by Hate. To that end, let thy spirit, (unto whom All Dispensations, till thy Son shall come Committed are) the hearts of men incline To be obedient to that Discipline, In ev'ry Form, which they believe to be To them injoyned by thy word and thee; And, that accept of, which they shall profess And practise with unbiast Consciences. Make thy Elect to stand out all the shocks, Of Tyranny, like never moved Rocks; And give them prudence, to discern the wiles, Whereby, their Antichristian foe beguiles Unstable hearts; and please to pardon that Wherein through frailty, they shall deviate. Indow them withall sanctified graces That may enable in their several places To do thee honor: And, LORD, let the Pride Of their Oppressors, break so, and devide Their Power and Counsels, that, they may at length Be ruined, by their own Wit, and Strength. Behold, the many troubles of this Nation, With mercy, and vouchsafe it thy salvation. Make haste to our deliverance oh LORD, And, succour us according to thy word. Let them be turned backward, and with shame Confounded, who blaspheme thy holy Name; Who, with their own inventions do defile Thy Ordinances, and pursue the spoil Of those who seek thy face. Let them who cry Aha Aha, and say insultingly, So we would have it, when thy people are Opprest, be caught at last, in their own snare, That, they who love thy Truth, may to thy praise Rejoyce in thy salvation all their dayes. But, gracious LORD, beside that wasting Rain, Which makes this Nation with much fear complain And brings me now to thee; there is a Flood Portending Inundations too, of Blood, Ev'n blood of Innocents, for whose prevention To be Petitioner I have intention. A portion of thy word, concerning Cain To me, a mystery seems to contain Implying somewhat which relates to those Who were, and shall unto thy Saints be foes Throughout all Times; and doth relate, likewise, To them, who offer thee that sacrifice In which thou most delight'st: For, ever since That day, Will-worshippers have took offence At their Oblations; and proceeded on In that, which he so long ago begun. Cain was the first that persecuted them Who in their worship differed from him; And, I collect thence, that, ev'n from that hour Thou didst subject them to the temp'ral power Of all those persecutors, of whom, he Became the Type, whoever they should be. And, as I understand that Hystory, Therein is couched the whole mystery Of that iniquity, which now is grown Almost full ripe, and shall be overthrown In thy appointed time; but, not till then, Nor by the weapons or the hands of men: For, thou hast markt them to be saved from Destroying, till their fatal hour is come. And I conceive likewise by what thou hast In that memorial to the world exprest, Thou wilt avenge it, on all, who withstand Their persons, with a life-destroying-hand, Though they are murdrers; &amp;, that, this suctjection Tends to thy glory, and the Saints perfection; Whereof, some of them, take so little heed, That of precautions they may have some need. This hath inclin'd me, conscientiously To shun opposing them destructively In whom there is a visiability Of Sov'raign Power, although tyrannical; Untill that some way, it grow doubtful shall To whom it appertains; as, here of late, When it was thought, thou didst that power translate To other hands, and when he, who bereft Them thereof, to an Anarchy, us left. And, thou, who knowst my heart, knowst I did never To pull down, or to set up Thrones endeaver: But, only, to preserve the common peace, Complide with that, which did the Throne possesse, Till thou restor'dst him, who was driv'n hence, And, to whom, true, I have been ever since. Now, also, to preserve, still, as I ought, That peace, whose preservation, I then sought; I do implore thee, on behalf of him Who wears this day, the Supream Diadem, That, from those evil Counsellors, he may Deliver'd be, who do, or shall assay, To bring him to a wilful resolution, Of being partner in that persecution Which they intend: And, that, in all temptations (And maugre all severest provocations) Thy Saints, may be preserved from contriving And acting, what may tend to the depriving Them of their lives or power, who e're they be, In whom that Power shall be confer'd by thee. And grace vouchsafe them, alwayes to persist In that obedience, which may manifest That, conscientiously they may submit To what thou hast ordain'd, or shall permit For their probation; till the fewd and War 'Twixt Good and Evil, at a period are: And, that, upon thy will they may attend Untill that Good and Evil, hath an end, Which had form us proceeding, and gives place To that Eternal GOODNESSE, which IS, WAS And SHALL BE, when all evil heretofore In Being, shall a being have no more. Meanwhile confer all means, whereby both they And he, may walk on, in a peaceful way. Thy Judgment to the King vouchsafe to give That, he, and we in Righteousness may live: That, he may to the Prisoners and the poor, Shew mercy; to the wrong'd, their dues restore; And be as kind and merciful to them, Who are opprest, as thou hast been to him: That, our high Mountains may produce thy peace, And little Hills, the fruits of Righteousness; For, whether high or low, all shall receive Such measure, as to other men they give. I know this will be done, even by the drops Of mercy, which to keep alive my hopes, Are in this place, to me derived from Thy Bounty, to fore-shew, a shower will come That shall refresh both me, and those, at full, Who, at this time, each others case condole. Be pleased to confirm this my belief, Redouble still, our Courage, as our Grief Shall be augmented: And although among Thy Foes, our bodies perish in the throng; By those external Judgments, which we shall Occasion to be Epidemical, Inflict them, rather then permit thy Name To be exposed to reproachful shame, By suffering wickedness with proud despight, To violate thy Justice in thy sight; Or, wantonize with grace, till it becomes The saddest of all Temporary dooms: For, common myseries less grievous are Unto thy Saints, though they in them have share, Then all their private sufferings, when they see Their insolence who sleighted them and thee, So winked at, as if thou either wouldst not, Avenge thy self upon them, or else could not. Thy Souldiers will be pleas'd amid thy foes To die, e're any honor thou shouldst lose, Since death by them, needs never to be fear'd, Who know with what life, thou wilt them reward. Let Dagons temple then, be overthrown Though Sampson die, in pulling of it down: For, all thy Souldiers, seek their glorifying In conquering, although it be by dying. Our General, in person, led the Van That way, when he his glorious Conquest wan, Bereft Death of his deadly sting, thereby, And, over Hell, triumphed gloriously. Preserve those, in thy Truth by Faith and Love, Whom thou shalt please in these last times to prove By fiery tryals: So, what e're wind blows, Whether, it rains or shines, or hails or snows; Whether thou shak'st the heavens or the earth, Or both; whether, War, Pestilence, or Dearth Shall visite this depraved Generation, Thine, shall be free from inward pertubation, And sing, a blessed Requiem to their soul, When their Oppressors gnash their teeth and howl. To that Salvation which thou dost design For thy Elect, preserve thou, me and mine; And, in our several passages thereto, Whether, the way in which we are to go Be either rough or smooth, or short or long, Keep us content; and let our Faith be strong Although the flesh is weak. Let our Afflictions And, our prosperities, with benedictions So sanctified be throughout our dayes, That, thou mayst in our lives &amp; deaths have praise A large Petition (whereof now bereft) Before thy face, long since ingrost I left, Whereby, I thee besought to this effect, For my Posterity; and to direct And keep them in thy ways: LORD, though to me The words are lost, they are not so to thee; My spoilers, cannot hide them from thine eyes, Nor wilt thou, my Requests therein despise. Rememember those, by whom we have been fed, When we were by the world depriv'd of bread. Vouchsafe thou, for their Charitableness, They, never want a Friend in their distress; Or comforts, when on their sick beds they lie, Or, Freedom, though on outward bands they die: Mind them, when I of them forgetful grow; Know them, though I their persons may not know; Their Alms-deeds, which they labour to conceal, Let thy Son, before all the world reveal; And, what for me or mine, in these my prayers, I have desired, grant to them and theirs. My Foes have some way been my Benefactors, (Though, therein, they against their wills were Actors For, that, which to afflict me they design, Adds more to their vexation, then to mine; And, that, whereby, they thought me to have harmed, Against all future mischiefs, me hath armed. In which respect, without dissimulations, They, are to me, an object of compassion, And, I beseech thee, so their hearts to turn That, for their sins, they heartily may mourn. To operate in them a preparation, To prosecute the means of their salvation, Their, too much loving of themselves abate, Which hath inclin'd them other men to hate, And more to punish them, who reprehend, Their sins, then those, who, against thee offend. Bereave them of that wealth, in which they trust, And spend, in giving fewel to their lust; That Power exorbitant, make to be less, Which doth but Pride, and Tyranny increase; Lest they may make themselves the slaves of sin, And to be Devils, who might Gods have been. Forgive them their offences against thee, When for them, truly penitent they be: For, all their wrongs to me I can forgive As I from thee forgiveness would receive. This Charity of mine to them, is thine; Thou, thereunto my heart dost now incline; Then, surely, if thou hast a love for those Who hate thee, yea whilst they continue Foes, Thou wilt on them bestow all I can crave, If they contemn not, that which they might have. And, who, can then, be hopeless of thy Grace, Who, in true faith, and love shall seek thy face? Oh hear me, in what to their welfare tends, For all in general, both Foes and Friends, (To whom, Christs ransom shall not bounded be, More by their own fault, then by thy Decree; And, who against themselves, shut not that Gate Which thou to all Mankind, hast open set.) Make us true Lovers, as we ought to be, And, we shall be beloved still of thee. Incline us charitably to regard The poor mans prayers, and ours shall be heard. Make us upright, and then shall rich and poor, More advantageous be then heretofore Unto themselves; and they who hate each other, Shall love, and live in amity together. None, then, shall make a prayer, to enjoy In private, what weal-publick, may destroy, But, all our suits, (as in destructive Rains Or Droughts) shall be prefer'd for what pertains Unto the common good; and very many Be benefitted, without harm to any. I shall, moreover, be permitted then, To do thee service with my Tongue and Pen, And, thou, with other blessings, wilt send hither What I now pray for, seasonable weather. LORD! should these meditations be despis'd, Or, (as some have been lately) here surpriz'd, And smother'd; I beseech thee, let them not By thee, be dis-regarded or forgot; Nor that, which yet remains to be exprest, Be stifled any longer in my brest: For, that, hath been more torment to my mind, Then to my Body, to be here confin'd. But, each branch only grant of these Requests As with thine own good pleasure best consists; And, that in chief, which hath preferred been To work in us, Repentance of all sin; Lest else, when from one Judgment we are freed, Another, and another still succeed, Till e're from all our fears, thou us deliver, We feel the sharpest arrows in thy Quiver. Though all alone, the world hath shut me here, And, from her self, exil'd me, as it were, She, being part of that great Work Divine, In which there is aswel a share of mine As hers: (And, though no sense she seems to have Of what I suffer in this living Grave;) I have a Fellow-feeling of her fears, As by these private musings it appears, Which often, heretofore I have exprest, On her behalf, and now, by this Request; Which GOD (I know) for his own sake hath heard, Although my prayer merits no regard. The last great Rainy-day, I first begun These Meditations; and, e're they were done, The Clouds were blown away, the Sun appear'd, The face of heaven was from thick vapours clear'd, And, he, who lately mustred them together, Continues, yet, a seasonable weather That will renew the hopes (if it holds on) Which this year promised, when it begun. For, (to the blessed name of GOD be praise) The earth begins her face again to raise, Out of her watry bed, chear'd by those Rayes Whose absence, made her many weeks of days Sit melancholly, and aside to throw, Those dressings, wherewith she is trimmed now. This, doth to me, appear to be a sign That, to compassion, GOD doth still incline, And, will, once more, make proof what Reformation Shall be endeavour'd after this probation. Oh! in some measure, let this grace effect That, which he justly, may from us expect, Lest worse befall: For, GOD will not be mockt; The doors of heaven, are not yet so fast lockt, But, that, he suddainly may send again, Not only such another wasting rain, (Or in the stead thereof a scorching Drouth And make the tongue, cleave to the parched mouth,) But Fire and Brimstone too, if he so please; Whereas, now, whilst his mercy doth appease His wrath, a little hearty penitence, Improv'd, may keep some other Plague from hence, And, for one sin that truly is repented, Three may removed be, or else prevented. Meditated and composed during the Authors close Confinement in the Tower, July. 1663. Oh! that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wondrous works to the Children of men. Psalm 107 8. The whole Psalm is very pertinent to stir up to a due consideration and practise of this duty. June 15. 1665. A PRECAUTION Relating to the time present. Two years are past, since what precedes was writ When here, Excessive Rains occasion'd it. The present Drougth, now makes us as much fear, A Dearth may probably conclude this year: For want of timely moisture, in the spring, Hath in the Bud, nipt many a growing thing; And that Defect continuing to this day, Starves herbs, and turns the standing grass to hay. The Winter corn, as yet, prick up their ears; But, to decay, the Summer Crop appears; And both (if GOD prevent not) may consume Before our usual harvest time is come. As, when to cure, or give their Patients ease, (Who long have suffred by a strong Disease) A good Physitian first applies for cures His best known helps in such distempratures, That failing, tries another; and that done, Doth then, through ev'ry course of Physick run, Repeats it often too; and as Events Occasion it, makes new Experiments: Ev'n so, hath GOD proceeded with this Nation, To bring us to a timely Reformation; Yet, our habitual wickedness is such, That, nothing works upon us very much, Except it be the quite contrary way: For, when we should Repent, and Fast and Pray, We Feast and Triumph: when we should release The Prisoner, we the Freeman do oppress. When we the poor and needy should relieve, The Rich we begger, and the poor we grieve. When Princes should put mourning Garments on, Each Vassal is arayed like a Don. The meanest Pinnaces weare Silken Sailes, And like the Peacock spread their gaudy Tailes. Yea, in the steed of due humiliations, In publick, here are publick provocations, Still multiplied quite throughout the land, Ev'n whilst we lie beneath GOD's heavy hand, And manifestly see, both ev'ry blessing Withdrawing, and Plagues ev'ry day increasing. He therefore, justly may, if so he pleases, Do, like Physitians, when they find Diseases To, be incurable. They then permit, Such Patients to take what course they think fit; Leave them to any Emperick, who will Pretend to that wherein he hath no skill; Send them to Epsom, or the Tunbridge water, Or, that at Lewsham (to which tis no matter) Or to that Country Air, where first they drew Their breaths, to try what thereon will ensue. Thither, if GOD sends after them a Blessing, Tis more then they deserve, and worth confessing: For, tis of his meer Grace; And, this, sometimes He doth vouchsafe ere men repent their Crimes. Such mercies none can sound, much less express; For they are infinitely fathomless. And, if they work not, in a timely day, GOD's will be done, is all, that I dare pray. The Authors Epitaph. Composed by himself, upon a Common fame Of his being dead and buried. It hath a short Preface prefixed, and an Epilogue added after it, for a Copartment to set it off. The Preface. Rumors of things that shall be, are begun Sometimes, before they actually are done, That, we thereby forewarned, may prepare To entertain them, when in Act they are; And, four times, at the least, (though yet I am Surviving it) my death hath been by Fame Divulged so, that some, no credit give To those men who affirm that I yet live. At this time also, a Report doth goe That, I was lately dead and buried too: Perhaps, not without being fore-design'd That I, in prison might be hunger-pin'd: For, having nothing left, that was mine own, Or ought allow'd, save what should be bestown, By their compassion, who have me preserved From being in my close Confinement starved, I might have dy'd indeed, through want of bread, Had all my Friends believed me to be dead. It may have likewise, an Ill Consequent, If, I shall be releast; which, to prevent I have compos'd this following Epitaph, Thus Prefaced, with this short Paragraph, And, sent it to my Friends, that, they may know I live, and live in hope, that what I owe To them, repaid (in life or death) shall be, By GOD, although, not probably by me. That, also, what this Epitaph expresseth May mind me of my duty, till life ceaseth; And, be by others, with some profit read, Both whilst, that I am living, and when dead. The Epitaph. By way of Epitaph, thus sed George Whither, when Fame voic'd him dead. If, I did scape the dooms of those, Whose heads and limbs, fed Rats and Crows, (And, was not thrown into the fire Or water, when breath did exspire) Then, here, (or somewhere else) my Bones, Lie raked up, with Earth and Stones. Their burial place, you shall do well To learn from those men who can tell, And in what mode inter'd they were; For, I do neither know nor care, Or, what was either sung, or said, By others, when I there was laid; Nor any whit, suspitious am That, they shall be expos'd to shame Nor fear I troubling of their rest, By those who living men molest, Because, how e're the world shall please To use them, they shall be at ease, When that, which her despight intends To me, shall ceaze on her own friends; As it befel to some, of late, If that be true, which fame doth prate. My Life was nor too long, nor short, Nor, without Good and Ill Report; And, profited, as many waies I was by Scandals, as by praise. Great foes I had, and very many, Friends too, a few, as kinde as any, And, seldome felt their earthly hell, Who love, and are not lov'd as well: For, that, whereof they had sharp sense, I knew, but, by intelligence. A Wife I had, as fit for me As any one a live could be; Yea, as if, GOD, out of each other Had made us, to be joyn'd together. And, whilst she lives, what ere is sed Of my Death, I am but half dead. Beside the Issue of my Brain, I had six children, whereof twain Did live, when we divided were, And, I, alive was buried here. When, Portions, I had none to give God gave them (as I, did believe He would) a means, whereby to live: Which is here mention'd, to this end, That others, may on him depend. I priz'd no Honours, bought or sold, Nor wish'd for youth, when I was old, But, what each Age, Place, and Degree, Might best become, best pleased me. I coveted nor Ease, nor Wealth (No, not enjoyment of my health) Ought further, then it had relation To GODs praise; and my Souls Salvation. When I seem'd rich, I wanted more Then e're I did when deemed poor; And, when in Body, most confind, Enjoy'd most freedom in my mind. I was not Factious or Seditious, Though thereof, many were Suspitious, Because, I humor'd not the times, In Follies, and destructive crimes. In things, that Good or Evil were, I had abundantly my share; And, never wish'd to change my Lot For what another man had got, Or, that, in any time or place, My Birth had been, save where it was. So wise I was not to be mad Though much opprest; or, to be sad When my Relations did conceive I had exceeding Cause to grieve: For, GOD, in season, still supplide Those needful things the world denide, Disposing ev'ry thing, so well To my content, what ere befel, That, thankful praise to him was due; And, will be, for what shall ensue. I sold not Honesty, to buy A formal Garbe of Sanctity; Nor to hate any was inclin'd Because, they were not of my mind; Nor fear'd to publish Truths in season, Though termed Heresie or Treason, But, spake, what I conceiv'd might tend To benefit both foe and friend; And, if in Love, they seem'd sincere, With their Infirmities, could bear. I practis'd what I did believe, And pinned upon no mans sleeve, My Faith or Conscience; for, ther's none Judgd, by what other men have done. My sins were great, and numerous grown; My Righteousness, was not mine own, Yet, more prevail'd by Grace divine, Then if it had been wholly mine. I loved all men, feared none Except my self, and GOD alone; And, when I knew him, did not make Esteem of ought, but for his sake. On him, in life time depended, By Death are all my troubles ended, And, I shall live again, ev'n here, When my Redeemer, doth appear, Which (by what I have seen and heard) I know, will not be long defer'd; Nor that Raign, here on Earth, among His Saints, which they have look'd for long. But, that, which we shall then behold, May better be believ'd then told; Because, we may presume as well To put the Sea into a shell, As to demonstrate, unto men, Of flesh and blood, what will be then. Nor oft, nor much desire had I, Long time to live, or soon to die; But, did the work I had to do, As I enabled was thereto; Then, whether lt seem'd Good or Ill, Left that, and all things, to Gods will; And, when this mind is not in me, That, I am dead, assured be. Do Reader, what I have well done; What I have err'd in, learn to shun; And, when I must no more appear, Let this, be thy Remembrancer. The Epilogue. This, I perceive will take up too much Room, Within a Church, or, on a Chappel Tombe; And, peradventure, need a larger Stone Then my estate will buy to write it on: Ile therefore, let it wander on betwixt The two Poles, till it finds where to be fixt: For, though it seems brought forth before the time, It may, whilst it continues in this Clime, Some way advantage me, by bringing that Into my minde, which I might else forget, That, Whilst I live, I might conform thereto So far forth, as I am oblig'd to do. Moreover, I shall know, (when this is read) What will be said of me when I am dead; Which, that man cannot hear, who shall not have An Epitaph, till he is in his Grave. Some part thereof, may likewise useful seem To others, who my words, now disesteem: For, through the spatious earth, I know not ought, That is, or may be said, or done, or thought, But, hath a tendance, if we heed it will, Either to what is good or what is ill: A Single haire, or fluttring of a Bird, May providentially, sometimes afford Hints, or precautions, to incline us, to What we ought to Observe, beleive, or do. This, also will be, as it were, to some A Messenger, who from the dead is come, To Preach what is agreeable to Reason, (Although it be a Preachment out of season) But, now, both dead and living Preachers too, Are sleighted, whatsoe're they say or do. And, if such Predicants found no regard, Where Moses and the Prophets were not heard, What, probably, from those can be expected Who Christ and his Apostles, have neglected? Yet, from dead Letters, and from men deceast There comes (from what in lifetime they exprest) A voice sometimes, to which men will incline, A willing ear; and so, there will from mine. A Petitionary Meditation on the behalf of F. S. The Authors much Honoured and Charitable, Friend then visited by a Languishing Sickness. In my contemplatings, VERSE, is to me What DAVID's Harp, to him, was wont to be; And, (on occasions offered) unto GOD) I, often, make Addresses, in this mode. Lord, thou didst raise me friends, when few or none I had, whom I could much depend upon; And, none of those, had they not first been thine, Could possibly have been a Friend of mine, In such a manner, or at such a time As when thy kindness did appear in them: For, such Respectiveness, to men that are In my case, is at this time, very rare. Thereby, they worthily therefore, are grown More precious for thy sake, then for their own; And, me to them it binds, in Bonds more strong, Then if their frindship, from themselves had sprung. My GOD, to thee, for one of those by whom Thou hast refreshed me I now am come To offer what my poverty affords; Which (though it be no more then hearty words) Be pleased to accept, for those proceeds, That were extended unto me in deeds; And, thereunto, vouchsafe thou to impute That vigour, which I cannot contribute; Since, there is nothing in my best oblation, Which of it self, can merit acceptation. On his behalf, whom thou to me hast given, I, here on earth, Petition thee in heaven, (Not for our own deserts, but for his sake, Who did for all mankind atonement make) That (if it shall be pleasing unto thee) His crazed health may now renewed be, And, he continue by thy preservation, A faithful servant to this generation, Till he those works hath finish'd altogether, For which thou principally sentst him hither; And, till they who yet want him, less may miss His passage from them, to eternal Bliss: For, Life, and all that therewith is bestown, He had, as well for their sakes, as his own. Thy people thought themselves oblig'd to plead To Christ for him, who for them, had but made A Synagogue: Elias thou didst hear For, her, by whom, refresh'd his bowels were: And, thou hast promised an easie bed, To them, by whom the hungry soul is fed; Whereby I am incourag'd, and inclin'd, To pray for him; who hath to me been kind, With hope, it shall some good product beget Both to thy glory, and his benefit. For, thou hast to the prayers of the poor, An ear as open, now, as heretofore, And grantst the humble sutes of faithful men, Aswell, as of thy greatest Prophets, then. To thee, I dare not absolutely pray For ought, belonging to the present day, Save what that patern warrants, which hath taught To whom, for what, and how to pray we ought. When therefore LORD, my frailty shall incline My will, to what repugnant is to thine, (Though I should ask it) let it be deny'd, And, wants, according to thy will supply'd. The objects, and the subjects, of my prayers Are positively, nor hopes fears, or dispaires, Or paines, or pleasures; neither joy nor greif; No nor a temporary Death or Life, (Though they concern my self) except they fall Within the verge of that Conditionall With which thou bound'st them: For, enough there is Besides that, grantable, unless amisse We ask it. And soon'st, thou wilt that dispence, When Faith assaults thee with most violence. Such things as thou hast promis'd, we may crave; Such things in their best season, we shall have, Though they are oft deferr'd, till we know better How, by their use, to make the blessings greater: Such things, I dare to ask, and persevere In asking them, untill vouchsafd they are; And, such things, ile now beg of thee, for him Whose cause I plead: LORD, therefore grant thou them Confirm him in that Love, whence all things had Their Beings, when created things were made; And, which at last, will knit up all in one That was created, when the world begun. Contentment give him, with what change soere Thou shalt be pleas'd to exercise him here. Preserve him in the saving faith of CHRIST, Which will secure the blessed interest That, he to all men offers; and to none Denieth, who, to lay fast hold thereon Not wilfully, and finally neglects, Thou having cur'd his natural defects. Grant him true self-denyal: him befriend, With constant perseverance to the end Of all his tryals: Every sin forgive Committed in the flesh, whilst he shall live. Enable him, whilst he hath time and place, To make such an improvement of thy grace On him conferred, that, as day by day, Sin sprouts up, it may rooted be away. In all, whereby the world, the flesh, or Devil May him assault, deliver him from evil, And all distemperatures, that may begin Either from things without him, or within. Let these Petitions, for his Consolation Be sanctified by CHRIST's Mediation, And lie still spread before thee, whilst in life, My Friend is sensible of pains and grief. So far forth also, as that, which by me Is pray'd for now, shall with thy will agree, Let him with faith, in our Redeemers name Both for himself and me, desire the same. And (to conclude this prayer) let all those By whom, thou hast been pleased to dispose, Thy manyfold Love-tokens unto me, In all, here prayed for, partakers be At ev'ry need; till thou translatst us thither Where, all thine, shall with thee, live still together. Amen. Vaticinia Poetica. or, rather, A FRAGMENT, of some PRESAGES, long since written, and, also, of some lately composed; which (though the Beginning, and later End, be clipt off) are neither altogether imperfect, nor impertinent, to these Times; But, doe considerably relate to all CHRISTENDOME in generall, and particularly to SPAIN, FRANCE, ROME, ITALIE, VENICE, and to some other parts of EUROPE, with the ILANDS thereof; especally to these of GREAT-BRITAN. Wherein are contained, likewise, some Cautions, touching them who are called QUAKERS, and the Nation of the JEWS. Sinè Nomine, non sinè Numine. Things, past, and present, doe foreshew Those, which, hereafter, will ensue: And, Candles, though but of a Rush, If lighted at that Burning-Bush Which wasteth not, may that disclose, Which Star, nor Moon, nor Day-light shows. Vaticinium Poeticum: OR RATHER A Fragment of some Presages, partly long since, and partly lately written; which (though the Beginning and later End be clipt off) are neither altogether imperfect, nor impertinent, to these times, &amp;c. Hic, desunt nonnulla I did intend Some Premonitions, forth to send. But I, in vain, have more then once Assaid to charm deaf Loggs and Stones: And, at this time, If, I should throw Those Pearls to Swine, th'event I know. I, therefore, now resolved am To wave, what to the seed of Cham, I purposd; and will speak to those, To whom my soul more service owes. Yee Sonns of Japhet, who long whiles Th'European Continent and Isles Have now possest (by grace from him Who hath, into the Tents of Sem, Perswaded you) be pleasd to read, What follows, with a serious heed: For, though, perhaps, I scarcely know, Whether I tell you Dreams, or no, This will be usefull; and, there may Be reall Truths, in what I say. According to the numeration Of years, by vulgar computation, In sixteen hundred fiftie five, The Roman-Tyrant will percieve His Empire sinke (begin to fear His Fatall Number draweth neer; And, therewith growing faint and sick, Throughout his Body-Politick, Take swift advisement, how, he may Procrastinate his Judgement-Day; And, shall finde means out, to beguile Himself, and others too, a while: For, till six hundred sixty three, A Project will pursued be, Wherby, the Saints will much be griev'd; And, many, doubt what they believ'd. The Stratagem he shall devise, Will be to cure th'Antipathies Of his Chief Champions, that their power May joyn, the Faithfull to devour: And, he shall prosecute that way With all the Force, and Craf, the may: But, to unsettle the Pyrene Which parts them (and, make Oile with Wine Incorporate) less hard will prove Then that Obstruction to remove; Because, th'Event, which will be best For th'one, marrs th'other's Interest; And, them, will, at the last, expose To Schisms, which no Designe shall close. It is apparent, that by him Who claims a Cath'like Diadem (And who, his Locusts spreads throughout The World, to bring that aime about) His Rival will, in little space, Be undermin'd, in ev'ry place, If, to that Peace he condescends, Which, his Friend seeming Foe intends, (And, who will prove, at last, much rather A Step-sire, then a Holy-Father. For, then, that Ofspring of the Woulfe, Will, on the City in the Gulf, Great mischiefs bring: Next, by his crafts, Divide, and break, those Sheaves, and Shafts, Through Europe; by whose Leagues, you see, His Projects unsuccessfull be; And, by whose Unity, that Flood Of Gog and Magog, is withstood, Which, else, long since, had broken in, And worse then Noah's Deluge bin. But, Remedies may be foreseen, Which, e're those mischiefs intervene That are design'd, will fruitless make Their Counsells; all their Engins break, And, make the Pitfall and the Snare Catch those, who did the same prepare. For, if the Cup of Fornications, Which hath inchanted Kings and Nations, Hath not caroused been so long, That; for all Charms it grows too strong, He, whom they stile, the Christian King, Will, with that Name, embrace the Thing Relating to it: (Thereby, finde That, they, whose ruine is design'd, Are his Chief Strength) and, then, to those Unite himself, who shall oppose The Whore, the Dragon, and the Beast, Which are, in three, one Antichrist: That, so, the Kingdome, and the Doome, Long look'd for (to his joy) may come. But, those Occasions, if he lose, Which Providence will, then, propose, In his own Bowels, there will breed A Gangreve, whereon will succeed His Neighbours Fate; and give him, there, His Portion, where his Interests are. The year, six hundred sixty six, A period, to the Beast, will fix, If numbred from that time, in which He rose, unto his highest pitch. The next preceding thousand years, The time of Sathans Bands, declare, Who, when the Lord, of life, was slain (And, Rome did to her height attain) Restrained was, from bringing in The Man, and Mystery, of Sin, For so long space (though, in the dark, It, sooner, did begin, to work) But, when that set time, was expir'd, The Birth was born, which, he desir'd; Ev'n, that Impostor, which hath, here, Now reign'd above six hundred yeere, Since he got loose; whose chain, did last Untill the thousandth year was past. Both these two summs, in one, contain The joint, and the divided Reign, Of bloody Rome, from her Declension, And Antichrist's, from his Ascention Into God's Throne: And, both their Falls Are shewn, in their own Numeralls, Without a wrested valuation, Without disordred computation, And, without adding, or omission, A doubling, or a transposition, Of any Letter. So, (by that Accompt, whereby our Deeds we date) About One thousand thirty four, The Beast did, first, receive his Pow'r; And, lose it shall, upon, or neer, The thousandth and seven hundredth yeer: Which makes, since first he took his Seat, Six hundred sixtie six, compleat; And, is the sum, which doth contain, The, whole, continuance of his Reign. Let those, that can receive it, heed This Mystery, and, give it creed, As it shall merit; for, to you, Though it may seem as vain, as new, It will not prove, to be so sleight, Or, such a whimsicall Conceit, As those, which groundless Fancy frames From Titles, Attributes, or Names; And, whereof, Wit makes Antichrists, When, and of whomsoe're, it lists. E're that day comes, you will behold Such Changes, as no Age, of old, Did ever see; and, year by year, Strange Novelties will still appear; Some mixt, and of a various make; Medlies, composd of white and black, Of truth, and falshood, wit, and folly, Of sacred things, of things unholy; And, some so plausible contriv'd (With paint, and shadows unperceiv'd) As would (if possible) beguile Th'Elect: yea, they shall for a while, Make many slip. Yet, these, must come And (though offensive unto some) Shall, at the last, Expedients be, To make Dissenters, more agree. There is, already, spreading forth A Generation, from the North, East, West, and Southward, who profess Simplicity, and holiness, Not much to be reprov'd: if, on The Rightside, them you look upon; Nor well to be allow'd, if, they Intend, what some among them say: For, if the truth of them be fam'd, They, are our Levellers, new nam'd; Or, els, th'old Cynicks, in a mode Newly disguis'd, are come abroad, To personate, in her excess, Pride, with a shew of lowliness. For, he that's proud, (and cannot be By other means, so great, as he That is the greatest) may with these, As proudly, as Diogenes, The Pomp of greatest men deride, And, tread on Alexanders pride; yet, in their sullen Cynick way, Be twice as proud, perhaps, as they. But my intent is to declare, What they may be; not what they are. Their goings out, are not with force, Either of armed Foot, or Horse, Neither with Multitude, or Power Externall; but, by three or four, Or two at once: Who, taking on A Garb and speech, which few or none Allow of (save themselves) neglect All those expressions of respect, Which are in use, to represent A personall distinguishment, Whether it in relation be To Wealth, Age, Office, or Degree. For this austereness, the Precise Dislike them; them, the Rich despise; The Proud, their manners doe deride, As not complying with their pride; The Covetous, they much displease, And, all that love luxurious ease; Which, doth beget them many foes, Reproach, Imprisonments, and blowes: Yet, Patiently they doe proceed, As if they did nor greatly heed Nor minde it: And, proceed they will Their Work, and Errand to fullfill: Wherein, the Best, may witness beare Against the world (yea, and I fear Against themselves) if well they heed What admonitions they doe need. And, when that they have walk'd their Round, And stood their time, it will be found, That, though some, under their disguise Spread scandals, and preach blasphemies, Which, for a while, obstruct those ends, That, Providence, by them, intends) It will, to Prudent men, appear, That, signes, unto this Age, they are, Of Things, which will, hereafter, more Consider'd be, then heretofore; As were some Actions, which, of old, The World did, with contempt, behold, When, they gave true signification, Of what befell that Generation. And, though that some, of these, assay, To take the wholsome Rules away, Of Faith, and Life, in hope to finde Christ, formed in their selfish minde, Without the Word; A Fierie-triall Will give, at last, a flat deniall, To their false hopes; Their own Work burn, To nothing; Make them back return, To Truths Foundation; Or, else, leave them To those Delusions, which deceive them. Wait, therefore, on each Dispensation, With Christian meekness, moderation, And charity: For, Time, will show Whether, they be of God, or no; How much of their designe, is evill; How much of self, or, of the Devill: And, men, thus tempred, shall not need To fear th'Events, that will succeed, Till they are greater haters grown, Of these mens faults, then of their own. Lights, from obscurity, will blaze, Of other kinds; which, though they'le cause Divisions, (and imperfect be,) Will help Times future, how to see Some Truths, conceal'd; and, lead the sight, Gradatim, to the noblest Light; If, of those false Gleams, men beware, Which, will, by Flashes, here and there, Break out, among them. Some, are such, As neither help, nor hinder, much; But, are like those, which, many think, They doe behold, when hard they wink; Or, like to those we view, sometime, Glare out of rotten wood, or slime. Some, like nocturnall wandring Fires, (Which lead men into Pits and Mires) Will oft appear; and, may doe harm: But, we, against them, have a Charm; And, they, who will, well know them may; For, they appear not, in the day; And, if men heed it, they shall finde Such, alwaies, leave a stinke behinde. The time, now, seemeth neer, likewise, When, they, on whom Cain's curse yet lies, Will make some Trialls, how they may, To their long-failing hopes, make way. For, now, that Ev'ning draweth on, Wherein, they to and fro, shall run, Like Doggs, about the Citie wall, (As was foretold) and grin, and bawle, Because, they have no Revelation, To satisfie their expectation: And, God, to pass, is bringing, now, A nobler Work, (for ought we know) Then they design: And, some of them, Will fit, for that Jerusalem They look not after: Yea, perchance, What they would marre, they shall advance And, when a carnall rest is sought, Finde that, to which they should be brought. For, (though they are disperst among The Nations, and have wandred long In much contempt) preserv'd they were For somewhat, which, time will declare When that day comes. Perhaps, those things, Which David, in their person sings, Of their undated desolation, Will bring them to consideration, That, all their Tokens are bereft; That, they have not one Prophet left; Nor any Prophecies, that give Assurance, of what they believe; Or promise, that, God, will restore Their Nation, as oft, heretofore, When they had sinn'd: And, that, the crime, For which they suffer so long time, Is, some fault, of a deeper die, Then either their Idolatrie, Or, all their ancient Crimes: yea, that The Sin which makes them desolate, Must be the sale, and crucifying Of him, who, for their ransome dying, Foretold the Plague, in which is neer Compleated sixteen hundred yeer; And, wherein, they shall still abide, Till they confesse whom, they denide. For, though their Law, they never better Observ'd, according to the Letter, Then they have done, since him they kild, By whom, alone, it was fulfild; Their legall service, to their Curse Still adds, and daily makes it worse. Yet, some, may, under this Rejection, Be Objects, of divine Election, (As I beleeve) And, who can tell When, God, shall pleased be, to seal Twelve times twelve thousands, of the Race Of Isr'el, by a stamp of Grace? (And, when to make up, he shall please, The Gentiles fulness) but, that these Shall mustred be, and called thither, Where those, Elect, must meet together; Who are to act that finall doome, Which, on his greatest Foe, must come? (And, who can tell, but, that by those, At whose rejection, we were chose, To witness against their offence, (And, whose preserving, ever since, Confirms our Faith) may usefull prove, To set forth his impartiall love, Who suffers all, aside to goe, That, he, to all, might mercy show? If so; he's blest, whom, God, then makes So wise, that, neither he partakes In their, deserv'd, Infatuation, Nor doth obstruct their Restauration. Some, seem to fear, that, if the Jews, (And, others too) who may abuse, That Liberty, should, in this Nation, Obtain, their wish'd for, tolleration, They, peradventure, thereby might Eradicate the Truth, outright; And, surely, whosoe're intends, That Freedome, for sinister ends, (Or, without Cautions, would thereby Infringe his own security: But, Truth's prevailing, none needs doubt, Where she hath Rome to fight it out; For, most refin'd and strong, she grows, When she is hem'd about with Foes. No thought (much less a Resolution) Have I, to force, by persecution, Religious duties: yet, I may, Both justly think, and safely say, That, if Exile, and Forfeits too, On him, with us, who should forgoe His Christian Faith, imposed were, Those Penalties, were not severe. For, if the way, which he then chuses, Be safer, then what he refuses, He buyes it, at an easie Rate, With less of Country, and Estate; And, if he changeth Good for Bad, He, justly, forfeits all he had. Were that Provision made; not many Would, on those terms, be Jews, if any. But, neither Jews, nor Turks, are worse Then Hypocrites: No greater Curse Can their admission, hither, bring, Then doth, from their Contagion, spring, Who, to be Christians, doe profess; And, are, in manners, nothing less. Whose, is the greater Blasphemie? His, who denies Christ's Deitie, Or Incarnation, with his tongue, And, doth him some despitefull wrong, Externally? (meerly, perchance, Through blindness, and, through ignorance;) Or, rather his, whose heart denieth Him, with whom he, in words, complieth? What Heathens, Jews, or Turks, can be So pestilentiall, as is he Who, preacheth Christ, from place to place? Who, boasteth of his saving Grace? Who, doth profess him, to be good? Who, hath his Raiment, and his food By that Profession? Who, doth praise His Love, his Precepts, and his Waies, Yet, in his life, himself doth shew Worse then a Pagan, Turk, or Jew? Beleeve it; till reform'd we are In Manners, we might, rather, fear The Jews admission, will our shame Much more illustrate, and our blame, Then harm us otherwayes; or, more Obdure their hearts, then heretofore, But, that, a Pow'r, above men sits, Which, out of Darknes, Light begets. Most Christian Nations, doe pretend, To seek their Weal; and, to that end, Make daylie prayers: (yea, some, too, This duty, with sincereness, doe) But, he's an Hypocrite, who sayes, That, he, for their Conversion prayes, Yet, thereunto, no means affords, Save, only, formall, empty, words. More then most Nations, we are thought, Their Restauration to have sought. They, also, thereof, notice take, Yet, when they come, a proof to make, Of our sincerity; Lo, we Grow fearfull, what th'events may be. But, in due season, God, I trust, Will render us, as wise, and just, As wary; and, direction give To Act, as well as to beleeve, What he requires; lest, we abuse Our selves; take Jesuites for Jews, And Runagadoes, from our Creed, To be the ancient Hebrew-seed; Or, else, shut up our hearts to those, To whom, our soul more Mercy owes: For, such, as truly are descended From Jacob (though they have offended) Are to be look'd upon, as men, Who may be reconcil'd agen. They, though rejected, are a Nation, Who claim a right in that Creation, Which we possess: At least, to Live, A right, by Nature, they receive, That, ought not to be rendred void, Lest, God's Fore-purpose be destroi'd. He, hath disperst them, here and there, That, we might not presume, but fear; And, of that Grace, be mindfull made, Which we, by their Rejection, had: But, if all Countries, where they be Should (as they might, as well as wee) Deny them an Abiding-place, Where should they finde the means of grace? Where should they live the life of Nature, The Birth-right, of each living Creature? How, by our Mercy, shall they gain That Mercy, which, in words, we fain To further? Which way, shall we show That Love, which, unto them, we owe, For their Fore-Fathers sake, by whom Salvation, unto us, did come? Or, how, to them, shall that succeed, Which, Providence hath fore-decreed? They, like to Cain, are mark'd out so, That, (though abhor'd, where e're they goe) They are preserv'd; and have aboad (Ev'n by the Common Grace of God) In sev'ral places, not a few, For which, they owe no thank to you; Nor much to them, with whom they dwell, Because, their Souls, or Bodies, weal Moves litttle, with their Entertainers, Save, when, by them, they may be gainers. But, being neither Pro, nor Con, In things, by others, to be done: My private judgment having shown, I'le leave each Reader to his own. God's Works, with Clouds, are vail'd about, Deep, high, (yea, past our finding out; And, many things, he hath to doe, To make his passage thereunto; Which, to unriddle, 'twill be hard, Because, mysteriously declar'd, By Glimerings only, to our eyes, Our Faith, and Hope, to exercise, Which, else, would fail; and, to provide Against the puffings up, of Pride. For, Revelations, when most clear, Of such a Ghostly nature are, (And, that, which should be understood, By them, is, unto flesh and blood, So hardly taught) that, few can see Their certainty, though true they be. I cannot speak, what I conceive, Nor utter that, which I beleeve, Yet, I conceive, beleeve, and mark, Enough to guide me through the dark, Without despair: And, my foresight Discernes, by Raies, which give true light, That, e're God's Work effect shall take, He, will, by sev'rall Changes, shake Thrones, Pow'rs, and Scepters, to break down Those Kingdomes, which oppose his own: That, likewise, he shall bring to nought All things, that humane Wit, hath taught: Yea, all that holiness, in which The Carnall Gospeller seems rich; And, bring a Generation in, Which, all things will, anew, begin (Save that Foundation, which must stand, Till there is neither Sea, nor Land.) The Life, w?? hath lain hid with Christ, Shall then, in us, be manifest, To mortifie, and take away That life of Sinne, which, to this day, Hath been upheld; Infuse that Light, Which makes a Day, without a Night; And, which shall not, as it hath done, Need either Star, or Moon, or Sun. Our Outward, and our Inward parts, Our Will, and Longings of our hearts, It shall renew; renew our Birth, Our Governments, the Heav'ns, the Earth; Yea, make all new, and, as a Scrowl, Wrap up all old things, in a Roll. In order thereunto, our eies Have, lately, seen a Prince arise, His entrance making through great Floods Of water; through unlikelyhoods, And Difficulties, which no hand, But his, who made both Sea and Land, Could have remov'd: And, though his Foes, Doe multiply; Though, malice grows Implacable, and many aime, To turn his Glory into shame; He is receiv'd, by other some, With Love and Honor, as one come, And, sent, by Providence, from Heav'n, To make the Dales, and Mountains, ev'n; To countenance, protect, and shrowd The Meek, and Righteous, from the Proud; Their Rights and Freedoms, to restore, To those that were opprest, and poor; And, Introductions to prepare, For things, which doe not, yet, appear: And, doubtles, if he shall ? Hîc deest multum. More had been said; but, some begin, Already, both to jeer, and grin. That's worse, which was exceeding bad: They that were foolish, are grown mad: Truth, is less favoured, then Lies: To be known honest, or thought wise, Is dangerous; and, he best thrives, Who, no man trusteth, or beleeves; And, can, by fals dissembling shows, Hide that, which he beleevs, or knows: I see it; and, am stricken dumb; From 'twixt my finger and my thumb, My Penne is fall'n: 'Tis also Night, And, I had rather sleep, then write. If, therefore, you desirous grow, To learn the rest, ask them that know What others think, and pleased are, To speak to them, who will not hear: For, having heard, what will befall To him, who tells his Mare a tale; To cool my broth, my breath I'le keep, And, try to sing my self asleep. SONG. My Soul, come listen to my Charms: And, now she rests betwixt mine arms, Sound out, yee everlasting Spheres, That Musick, which no mortall hears: And, whilst thereto, my Tongue forth sings Those calm, and blessed Requiems, Which, this depraved World contemns, Thy self, my discomposed heart, New-tune (in Consort) to bear part, With them, upon her quav'ring strings. Though all things in confusion be; Though, from corruption none are free, Why should our Bowels yerne, or pant? What need we fear? What can we want, Which we, by reason, would enjoy? No rising, or declining Star, Our blisse, can either make, or mar; No influence, of Moon or Sun, Or, ought omitted, or misdone, Our peace, or safety, can destroy. Look up, to that bespangled Skie, So bright, so spacious, and so high: A higher Orbe, those Orbes contains, Where my Redeemer, lives and reigns; To him, by contemplation, mount, By him, Hopes Anchor, cast, and weigh; On him, by Faith, firm holdfast lay; With him, by Love, thy self unite; Through him, establish thy delight; And, of him, make thy chief account. Then, from that height, thine eyes down cast, On all things, which on Earth are plac't; (Ev'n on the bravest of those things, Which are the pride, and joy of Kings) And, on those Bugbears, which men dread: And, when thou findest, what they prove, (How worthless of thy Fear, or Love) Thou may'st, with confident repose, Ly down, alone, where all thy Foes, Their Banners, have against thee spread. Sleep, then; for, all, those windes that blow, And bluster round about thee so, Into a calm, will either turn, Or, breath away, at last, with scorne, And, prove but puffs, to be despis'd. Sleep; for, those goodly seeming Gaudes, Which thou admired'st, are but shades, That, in a moment, will be gone, And, worthy, really, of none, But, Fools, or Madmen, to be priz'd. Sleep; for, those earnest Longings, which Disturb'd thy Rest, are but an Itch, Or, Dreamings, that will take their flight, As soon as Day removes the Night, Though, much account of them thou mak'st. Sleep; for thou neither feel'st, nor hear'st, Such Bears, or Lions, as thou fearst; They are but squeekings of small Mice, Or, niblings, of those Fleas, and Lice, W??, will fall from thee, when thou wak'st. And, you, who have disturbers bin, Of Rest, without me, or within, Submit your selves to due controll: And, when, on my retired soul, A sweet refreshing sleep, shall seize, I, charge you, by the Pow'r of those Who guard th'Elected from their Foes, (On penalty, of whatsoe're The damn'd Infernall Spirits fear) That, her, you wake not, till she please. Give ear, oh, regardfully give ear What is timelie here expressed relating to this Generation. [Last Midnight, many things to minde were brought] To fill up the following spare pages, this Midnight Musing of the Author is here added. Last Midnight, many things to minde were brought; Amongst w??, this that follows, came in thought. Now, most men are in Bed; and, so am I, (Employ'd in Musings, whil'st they sleeping lie) Why, may not, in our Graves, a diff'rence be, As well as in our Beds, 'twixt them, and me, Which will my Soul, in somewhat, active keep, Whil'st, in the Bed of Death, my Flesh doth sleep? Since, God, made all things good; Why entred in, Such enimies thereto, as Death, and Sinne? Why, is the World, so over-spread with evill? Why, is there not, a God, without a Devill, As in Eternity, e're Time began? Or, wherfore, seeing God created Man In purest, and in perfect Innocence, prevail'd it not, to keep him from offence? And, why, so long as Time lasts, shall there be Such warre, betwixt the two Seeds, as we see? Some Thoughts, within me, to these Thoughts repli'd; Th'Eternal Wisdome, did this means provide, To make the Infiniteness of his Nature, So farr forth knowable, unto his Creature, That it might love him, and, enjoy Communion With him, in an unseparable Union, By having reall proofs, in Time and Place, Of his eternall Righteousnes, and Grace: Which could not be effected, but, by giving A reasonable pow'r, with Rules of Living, Upon Condition, safe and easie made, By what, his Mercy, thereunto should add; Except, he should have made him to excell Those Angells, that, both stood in Grace, and fell: Which, had been, to have made him of a Nature, So far beyond the Limits of a Creature, That, at the Moment, wherein first begun Mans Being, he, with God, should have been One. Which, was a Dignitie (though preordain'd Eternally) to be, by man, obtain'd Another way; whereby, it being known, What Attributes were God's, and what his own, The Love and Union, which, from thence should flow, Would, to perfection, answerable grow. Betwixt the supreme Creature, and his Maker, There cannot be a Mean; or, a Partaker In Supreme Power; neither, can there ought Below the God-Head, possibly be brought Into Existence, which, a Pow'r can have, To make it own self; or, it self to save From losing of that Being: But, by loving His Maker; and, by faithfully improving Those Talents he receiv'd: wherein, the Giver Hath, also promised to each Receiver, Concurring aid, both to beleeve, and Doe, What he requires; and, will perform it, too, In ev'ry soul, that swerveth not aside, Through selfness, malice, wilfullness, or Pride. As had the Angells, Man had pow'r to chuse The Good way, and the Evill, to refuse: And, had the self same blessed means of Grace Which those Good Angells had, that kept their place. Two disadvantages, alone, he had, Whereto, no Angell was obnoxious made, Flesh, and a Tempter, for which God did please, To give, to Mankinde, two Advantages, Deni'd to Angells; That is, Penitence; And, One to satisfie, for their offence: Who, from his fall hath rais'd Man, to be greater Then Angells: yea, and to a State that's better Then what he lost; if he, again, abuse not His Talents, and renewed Grace refuse not. By making Man, and all things, as they were First made; And, by his ordering, ev'ry where, Each Creature, in his Course, according to Those motions, wherein, naturally, they goe, The Justice, Love, and Wisdome, doth appear, Of him that moveth in the highest Sphere. Thereby he, in some measure, is exprest; And, could be no way else, made manifest. For, as God, is, he, fully can of none Be known, or lov'd, but of hmself alone. Meer Sense, to no mans understanding brings The Notion of Intelligible things; Nor, perfectly, all those that come within Their own Orbe, till their knowledg, bought hath bin, By some Privation. By the Night we know, The Comforts of the Day. Our pains doe show What Ease and Pleasures are; And, when we shall Regain the Reason, maymed by our Fall, It will, by ev'ry man, be understood, That, as God, at the first, made all things good, His Providence did likewise so forecast, That, ev'ry thing shall turn to Good, at last. Though, woe to them, by whom Offences come, They are Expedients, and there must be some, And will be, while the disagreeing Creature Is lab'ring in the Common Course of Nature. For, ev'ry diffring thing, conduceth to That, which their Wise-Disposer means to doe. Virtues, and Vices; things prophane, and holy; Weakness, and Strength; true Wisdom &amp; meer Folly; Hypocrisie, Sincerenes, Truth, and Lies, The most abhorred of all Heresies; Turks, Jews, and Pagans; Martyrs, and Confessors; Ev'n Rebells, Tyrants, Traytors, and Oppressors; Yea, and the Devills too, shall help complete, In their despight, the Work they would defeat; And, as it was, before the World begun, God shall be All in All, when All is done. Thus, casually, to fill a vacant Rome, These Midnight Musings into words are come, Compos'd in haste; which will (it may be) keep Some Readers, waking, when they thought to sleep, To meditate, upon that End and Use, Whereto, such Thoughts, most properly conduce; And, learn, whil'st they amongst Disorders dwell, To trust in him, who Orders all things well. Three Private MEDITATIONS, Which being, for the most Part, of Publick Concernment, are therefore Published, by their Author, Geo. Wither. The First, is, a Private Thanksgiving, consisting of three Hymns, whereby GOD is magnified for his Mercy vouchsafed in the late Ingagement between the English and the Dutch, in June 1665. Composed after Celebrating the Publick Thanksgiving commanded by the King. The Second, is a Sacrifice of Praise &amp; Prayer, by him offered to Almighty GOD, for his providential respect, to Him, his Wife and Children, during his Imprisonment in the disgraceful Goal of Newgate, when left destitute of all ordinary means of subsistance, by being deprived both of his Estate and Liberty. The Third, Intituled NIL ULTRA, is a Soliloquium, wherein this Author expresses the improbability of an effectual proceeding further, to prevent the Sins and Plagues increasing, by ought which he can offer to consideration. A Private THANK-OBLATION, Consisting of Three Hymns, Whereby Almighty GOD is magnified for his Mercy vouchsafed in the late Ingagement between the English and the Dutch, in Iune 1665. after Celebration of the Publick Thanksgiving commanded by the King. The first Hymn, is a Preparatioon of the heart to the Duty intended. [Now, what to GOD's Praise belongs] [1] Now, what to GOD's Praise belongs, I will sing in holy Songs; Who shall from his Heav'nly Quire, With such strains my heart inspire, That (though distant) I and they Therein joyn together may: For, his influenced Grace Is not barr'd by Time or Place. 2 Let his Rays of Light Divine, In me, and upon me shine; Let his Holy Spirit shake Drousie flesh, till it shall wake; Touch my lips, unloose my Tongue, That his Praises may be sung; For, till rouz'd up, from on high, Dark, and dull, and dumb am I. 3 Humane words, cannot impart What GOD speaketh to my heart, Nor my faultring tongue declare All his Operations there; Yet, I am compell'd sometimes, In plain Verse, and broken Rimes, Thus, to stammer out such things, As to me the Spirit brings. 4 To extol what God hath done, Here, I musing am alone; And, do praise him in my heart For what none can claim a part: But, what to his praise belongs I'le now sing in vocal songs; And, will so his praise declare, That, no man shall therein share. The second Hymn, being an imperfect Narrative and Confession to Gods glory, of what he hath done for us in the late Ingagement; how little we have merited the mercies vouchsafed, and how merciful GOD hath been to both Nations. [Lord, in a publick Meeting, I, this day] [1] Lord, in a publick Meeting, I, this day Have joyn'd, a Sacrifice of thanks to pay; And, being warmed at the common fire, (By what external notions could inspire) To perfect that which is begun, (And ought in duty to be done) I, now withdraw into my heart, To speak to thee, who therein art; And learn, how, I may to thy praise, So sanctifie my words and wayes, That henceforth, they may more conduce unto Thy glory, then they heretofore could do. Oh! let my Meditations be Made acceptable unto thee. 2 For Victory confer'd, we prais'd thy Name; We hear, our foes have likewise done the same. And doutless, whosoever lost or won, To thee, are praises due for what is done; Yea no less praise for what is lost, Then that, for which we triumph most; The one our pride may elevate, The other, humble us for that Which was mis-acted, or mis-spoke; For, thou, who heed of both hast took, So graciously, oh Lord, hast shar'd betwixt Both Nations sweet with bitter intermixt, That, no man, this day duly keeps, Save he, who therein sings and weeps. 3 For all Transactions, which concern in gross Our publick, or our private gain or loss, (And which unto our knowledge, fame doth bring, Well-weigh'd) gives cause, no less to weep then sing. The good successes we have had, Abate some fears, to make us glad; The hopes, which those events do give (Of what we willingly believe) So high our expectations rear, As if we were above all fear. But, when we hear the many Lamentations For loss of Limbs, Lives, and belov'd Relations, To sadness all our Joy it turns, And he who much rejoyced, mourns. 4 A final Conquest is not yet obtain'd; That, rarely with one Victory is gain'd: For, they who lose at first, at last may win, By mending faults, with which they did begin. And they who did at first prevail, Find, oftentimes, their hopes to fail: Because to trustless things they trust, Or else, employ to feed their Lust, That which thy Majesty intends Should strengthen them to better ends. When, therefore most Victorious we appear, Let us rejoyce, but with a trembling fear; Lest, when the rowling wheel shall turn, We who rejoyce, find cause to mourn. 5 Thou art but little pleas'd (if ought at all) To see us triumph, when our foes do fall; Especially, when they (though ours they be) Are thy known enemies, no more then we. To be our GOD, we thee profess; They (to our knowledge) do no less. We say, our trust is in thy Name; They may as truly, say the same. Their sins are many; we are sure (Or may be) that ours are not fewer. We have not yet, our hopes at full enjoy'd; Nor are their expectations quite destroy'd; To praise thee therefore, we and they, Are equally oblig'd this day. 6 VVe say the Dutch to us ingrateful be; Our Conscience tells us we are so to thee. They with our Nation cruelly have dealt; Our inhumanity thy Saints have felt. Their Avarice makes them oppress; Ill husbandry and idleness, Have made our wayes as grievous prove, To those who seek for peace in love. And we, and they, pursue the course, Most likely to make bad things worse. Then, Lord, which of us justly can expect That our Contests should have a good effect? Or, that the one should have a place Above the other in thy Grace? 7 Had it so pleased thee, thou at first shock Both Earthen Pitchers mightst have justly broke; But they (as if they had been made of leather) Are only bruis'd, by being knock'd together: VVhich, in meer love to us and them, Thou didst vouchsafe to give us time, VVith more advisement to take heed, VVhat, by Contention, will succeed; Lest both before their Quarrels end, Be broke like pots, which none can mend. Lord, were there but that Mercy, and no more, In that which we pretend to praise thee for, It merits from this and that Nation, An everlasting Thank-Oblation. 8 For, in this Mercy, unto both extended, Are very many Mercies comprehended, So complicated, one within another, And, to thy Judgments linked so together, That, if we could be brought to learn, How, they both Nations do concern; To what each Judgment doth direct, What every Mercy might effect; What we should seek, what we should shun, And, what ought timely to be done; The wisest men among us could not tell Whether those things which us have pleased wel, Or, that which grieves us most, shall best Thy Loving-kindness manifest. 9 The Trophies, which most men delight to raise, As testimonies of a thankful Praise, For what thou daign'st, are but a medly mirth, Of wholsom simples mixt with coursest earth; Or, with such noisom weeds as grow Upon dunghils here below, That to thy nostrils and thine eyes, Offensive fumings vaporize, Which do provoke thine Anger more, Than many Errors heretofore: And that which for thine Honour some pretend, Is for their own praise, or a baser end; Either to satisfie their Lust, Or, praise false gods, in which they trust. 10 My GOD, look not severely upon this, Or on ought else that hath been done amiss; For no Oblation can from us proceed, VVhich will deserve a favourable heed. Some of our Offerings, now and then, May beneficial be to men, Or, to thy Saints on earth extend, If we confer them to that end For which they seem to be bestown, (And in their welfare, seek our own:) But, to advantage thee, the precioust thing, Which, we to please, or to appease can bring, Adds nothing: though thou pleased art, With what comes from a faithful heart. 11 Be mindful still, that we are flesh and blood, Whence nothing can expected be that's good, Till by his Cross it shall be mortifi'd, Who, to redeem it from corruption, dy'd. Remember whereof we are made; That ev'n the best of us are bad; Our seeming sanctified joyes, Uncomly actions and rude noise, Which make thy best beloved sorry, Instead of adding to thy glory. Oh! let hereof, a free unfain'd confession, (A burnt Oblation made by true contrition, And, hallow'd by Christs blood) purge hence, All that which gives to thee offence. 12 The more thou shalt inlarge our wealth and power; Our selves, let us lay down so much the lower; And, rather use them to unite together In love, then in destroying one another. He, in the best mode gives thee praise, Who ordereth aright his wayes; Who, justifies thee in thy will, By thereunto conforming still; And brings to thee a contrite heart, Ascribing thereto no desert: This is, most gracious GOD, a sacrifice, Which thou didst never (never wilt) despise; And, such a sacrifice, I pray Make that which I present this day 13 Unfaigned thanks my heart returns to thee, For that, which thou hast done, what e're it be, Against, or for us: hearty thanks we owe Both for what thou withholdst, and dost bestow. Prosperity is no true sign Who is a Favourite of thine; Nor any one dost thou reject, Whom frequently thou dost correct, Unless he be more wilful far Then frail, as very many are; And whether thou dost give us wounds, or heal, It will at last conduce unto our weal, If we, (but as we may) persever In contributing our endeaver. 14 Two of thy greatest Plagues on us now lie; The third is threatned, and seems very nigh: Thy other Judgments also scatred are So thick, through these three Kingdoms ev'rywhere, That, by them, very few or none, Have scaped, being seiz'd upon; Or, being pincht, in what relates Unto their Persons or Estates: Yet, sin doth most men so besot, As if thy frowns they feared not; And, are more zealous others to destroy, Then, of the means their own peace to enjoy. A madness, which worse plagues procures, Than Pestilential Calentures. 15 Arise, O GOD, advance thy Throne on high; Thy self, let thine own actings glorifie. Thy Justice and thy Mercy so unite, That they may honour thee in all mens sight. Rebuke those who delight in War, And to thy Saints injurious are: Give Peace to those who Peace affect, And them from all their foes protect, That Righteousness and Peace may hither Return, and here still reign together. Thy foes are now become exceeding strong; Thy coming therefore, Lord, defer not long. But, I have done; for thou with pow'r Art coming, and wilt keep thine hour. 16 Dear GOD, this petty sacrifice of mine, Was took out of a Treasury of thine, And, of mine own, I nought can thereto add, Except my heart, which from thee too, I had: Kept to thy self, now let that be, And never left again to me; Or wander thither, where it may Unto the world be made a prey; Or, by the temptings of the Devil, Be drawn unto the love of evil; Then this (and that, which I have heretofore, To praise thee offer'd) thee shal praise much more, Than many things, done, heard, and told, In Temples deckt with Silk and Gold. The third Hymn, proceeds to a thankful Illustration of GOD's deserved Praise, by acknowledging his Almightiness; his observing what hath been openly and secretly done in every part of the World, by both the said Nations, and that no praise is justly due to either of us, but shame rather, for ought performed in the said Ingagement. [Most Almighty LORD of Hoasts] [1] Most Almighty LORD of Hoasts, High Protector of our Coasts, Who command'st, as thou dost please, Fire and Water, Earth and Seas; Who lookst down from Heav'n, upon All that here on Earth is done, And survey'st her darkest parts, Ev'n the Crannies of mens hearts. 2 Thou beheldst the Preparations Of these wilful Neighbouring Nations; Thou hast heard what they have spoken, Heedest what such words betoken; Thou hast search'd out their Designs, With what thereto them inclines, And knowst whether of the two Is the worst, if one be so. 3 Thou observest what was done, Not in Africa alone, Or both Indies; but what was Done likewise in ev'ry place: Why the English and the Dutch Are divided now so much: What is false, with what is true; And to which most blame is due. 4 Thou remembrest what Relations Have been long between these Nations, What Professions to each other They did make when knit together; Yea, what they profest to thee, Which now seems forgot to be, As if they were not such men, Or such Christians now, as then. 5 To prevent what is begun, Much, by thee, was timely done; But, their Avarice and Pride Them did more and more divide. To self-will they did adhere, Like men without wit or fear; So thou leftst them both to do What they were enclin'd unto. 6 Then with Streamers and with Flags, Foolish vaunts and shameless brags, They weigh'd Anchors from the shoar, Which by some was seen no more; And, with an unchristin a rage, 'Gainst each other did engage; Fire and Water, in that hour, Striving which should most devour. 7 Dread of Death, that man amazes; Noise, and smoke, and sudden blazes This man blinds, and deafneth so, That he knows not Friend from Foe. Some are slain by their own Tools; Wise-men speed as ill as Fools: Here a Valiant Souldier dies, There a Coward sprawling lies. 8 Loud the thundring Guns did roar, Sails, and Masts, and Keels were tore; Ships were either split or fir'd; Men by thousands there expir'd; This man sinks, and that man swims; Some escap'd with loss of limbs. But to whether best befel, Thou alone, O Lord, canst tell. 9 Horrid sights, and sounds without, Them assaulted round about, Which, in some, did thoughts begin, That rais'd greater Frights within; And, though wounds did grieve them sore, That tormented them much more; For their pains none can declare, Who in spirit wounded are. 10 This we know that thou art just, As is ev'ry thing thou dost: Thou art kind, and lov'st so well, That by woundings thou dost heal. Thou art wise, and actest so, That we thereby wise might grow; And by what was lately done, Might new Mercies be begun. 11 Not to Us, LORD, for the same, Be the praise, but to thy Name: Unto us, for what was done, Nought belongs, but shame alone. We were so much terrify'd, That, we knew not what we did, Nor yet seem to understand, What work thou hast now in hand. 12 This Correction was in love, Which, if both should so improve As (if they had grace) they may By true penitence this day, Our endeavour to be Friends, To thine honour so much tends, That, it would for both these Nations, Prove the best of their Oblations. 13 Victories do not belong To an Arm of Flesh, though strong. Tis nor Policy nor Force, Ships, nor Troops of Men and Horse; No, nor formal thanks and prayers, That prevents Death, or Despairs; But it is thy powerful Arm, That secures from fear and harm. 14 Therefore praise, for all well done, I ascribe to thee alone: All that men have brought to pass, Merits nothing but Disgrace; And the best that we can do, Will but Ruine add thereto, If we keep our crooked wayes, Or shall grudge at thy due praise. A RESOLVE, Occasioned by somewhat spoken concerning this Thank-Oblation, and this Authors other Writings. It may be, many will these Hymns contemn, Because, they do not relish well to them. They likewise may Inferiour Gods offend, Because in this Oblation, I intend No praise to them, but that, praise should be given To magnifie alone, my GOD in heaven. The first of these, I leave to their own mode, In offring up Oblations unto GOD: For, if well-pleasing unto him they be, They cannot be distasteful unto me; And whatsoever they of me shall say, I may be thereby profited some way. As for the latter, there is little need That I to their deserving should take heed: For Prophets, Priests and Poets of their own Enough they have, to make their merits known. These, to extoll their Patrons, can, and may Write more, and speak much more, then I dear say, Who, (whatsoe'er advantage thence may flow) Can praise no man, for what I do not know. These do, as their inspirers them incline, And I do, as I am inspir'd by mine. Moreover, it becomes not him, who sings A Song of praise unto the King of Kings, The Attributes of men to intermingle With his (as to those works he worketh single) That were to follow their absurd example, Who worship GOD and Baal within one Temple; Or Chronicle the Deeds by HERO'S done, With Tales of Robin Hood, and Little John: For these respests, I know men Sober-witted Will me excuse for what may seem omitted; And, as for those men, who so prudent are not, Whether they me excuse, or no, I care not. A Sacrifice of Praise &amp; Prayer Offered unto Almighty GOD, by George Wither, for his gracious Providence, in providing for Him, his Wife and Children, during his Imprisonment in the disgraceful Goal at Newgate, and when left destitute of all ordinary means of subsistance, by being deprived both of his Estate and Liberty. Lord, though my Prayers and my Praises be Unworthy to be offer'd up to thee, Thus (as I am obliged) I essay To add unto thine Honour what I may, By publishing both with my Tongue and Pen, Thy Loving-kindness to the sons of men; Especially, in those particulars Whereby thy kindness unto me appears. Prais'd be thy blessed Name; for thou art speedy In shewing thy compassion to the Needy; And leav'st not any Suffrer in despair, Who timely seeks thy help by faithful prayer, In patient waiting during his probation, For thy appointed hour of Salvation. Of this, thy never failing Clemency, Few men have had more evidence then I. Or in all straights, vouchsaf'd more seasnably A needfull, and a competent supply; Yea, though my suffrings have been great and many, And I in flesh as sensible as any Of ev'ry grievance, thou hast by their length Improved so my patience and my strength, That, oft such grievances, were not alone As tolerable as if they were none: But such as also have my joy encreast, When I to other men seem'd most opprest. For, though I have compleated now well near, In weal and wo, the three and fiftieth year, And six Confinements, since I first begun That Work, which I thought needful to be done; Thou hast preserv'd me so, and me so arm'd Against all Changes, that none me hath harm'd; Which unto me a knowledge doth derive Of what thou art, that's more than spec'lative; That what experimentally I speak, In other men may more impression make, Than when I Notions only shall declare, That were infus'd into me through the ear. And 'tis not thy least Mercy, that of late Thou dost their seeming Charity abate, Who thought they might thereby have tempted me To wrong my conscience, and be false to thee, By smoothing or adulterating that, Which to Truths vindication may relate: For, when with needful food men bait their hook, The heedless hungry Fishes are soon took; And, whether we confide in thee or no, Whilst we have Oyl and Meal, 'tis hard to know. Nor I, nor mine (though rob'd of all) ought lack What's needful for the belly or the back. Thou hast my Wife and Children cloath'd &amp; fed, When I could neither give them Cloth nor Bread; And from the Earth, (when in seed, branch and root, I seemed likely to be rooted out; My Withred Sprouts were then by thee replanted, Where they enjoy the nourishment they wanted: So timely, and in such a manner too, VVas that vouchsaf'd which thou wert pleas'd to do; That for it my Well-wishers prais'd thy Name; And vext thereat my envious foes became; Especially in that place, where their worst And last despights were manifested first; For there, and in their sight, by whom undone I seem'd to be, that mercy was begun. The Families from whom I was design'd To take my being, thou hast now twice joyn'd, And their two Surnames, being joyn'd together, Denominate my Grandson, HUNT L'VVITHER, VVho is in possibility to have Earth of his own wherein to make his Grave; And find a Livelihood whilst here he lives, If he thy Bounty thankfully receives; (And no whit further shall be trusted in, Than that should be, which hath supplied bin Instead of what I lost) For, Lord, in thee, (And not in what thou giv'st) our trust should be. My only Daughter when left portionless, And without any likely hopefulness Of more than thou didst on her Birthday give her; Yea, when I was disabled to relieve her, Thou didst, ev'n in that great necessity, Espouse into a Loving Family, Enobled by a Pedigree or Stem, VVhich hath no blemish to disparage them; Or such wants, as may make the reputation Of Births and Titles lose their estimation. Oh! let thy so uniting them together, Make them a mutual blessing to each other; And, by considring with due thankfulness, What thou hast done for me in my distress, Make both my Children and their whole descent With thy good pleasure, at all times content; That they to others, good example giving, By their well-doing, joyn'd with right believing, (And likewise heeding how thou dost proceed With such as in thy Fatherhood confide) They never may despair, though quite bereft Of what their earthly Father might have left: And, from my personal experiments, Let them, thereof to minde them, take some hints. For when I by the world seem'd quite forsaken, And she, with Lands and Goods, from me had taken My Liberty; that, what then grieved me Might more imbittred, and redoubled be, By what my Children suffred; when, they had No means of comfort, and, thereby grew sad: Thou didst for that a Remedy provide, By making them a Bridegroome, and a Bride (Whilst I imprison'd was within that place, Which added to my Poverty, disgrace) To my good liking, and their own content, Without self-seeking or disparagement. This providential mercy, did appear The more, in that, they likewise married were, (As I awhile before, presag'd they should) Without such portions, as I lately could Have given them, when thou didst me disable Not without cause. And, tis considerable That, they kept both their Weddings in the sight Of those, who them pursu'd with most despight; Ev'n in my plundred house, and at that time, In which my wife had not to welcom them A dish or spoon, but what a neighbour lent; Or meat, but what by thee was thither sent. Yea, thou hast, when the world deni'd us bread, Me and my Consort competently fed, (E'er since, the world depriv'd us of our own) By them, whose faces are to us unknown; To evidence, that all thy Saints are friends, To him, who on thy providence depends, And to the utmost of his power persevers In just and conscientious endeavers: Yea, though corruption so in him prevaileth, That of his duty many wayes he faileth. He, hoping those Experiments to some May comfortable in like straits become: Thus, for their sakes, in words exprest they be For, without words, all things are known to thee. All this consider'd, I obliged am To take unto my self deserved shame, When therewith I will heed, how oft, by sin, To thy commands I have rebellious bin; As also, that exceeding graciousness, Which thou to me vouchsafest ne'ertheless: And it begets in me a greater fear, Then when thy Chastisments upon me are; For, in correcting me, thou art more mild Then is a loving Father to his Child, When he not only chideth, but intreats, Kind language mixing also with his threats; Whips him, then kisseth; and sometimes to see Him weep, doth shed as many tears as he. LORD, for those mercies graciously afforded, (Well meriting, by me to be recorded) Accept this petty Sacrifice of praise, And make us truly thankful all our dayes; (Not only in our verbal Thank-Oblations, But also, in our lives and conversations:) For, though we cannot Golden Gifts prefer, Yet we may offer Frankincense and Myrrh; And from him, who hath not a Lamb to give, A Dove thou with acceptance wilt receive. Vouchsafe us, in each temporary trial A constant progress with true self-denial; Let not the benefits we have received Be underpriz'd, because we were bereaved Of those externals, which we have enjoyed, For, their enjoyment might have us destroyed; Yea, those whom thou mak'st poor thou lov'st as much As those, whom thou art pleased to inrich; And, by thy Grace we may advantage make, Of whatsoever thou dost Give or Take. Keep me and mine from that Prevarication VVhich turns thy proffred Grace to Reprobation. Incline us to desire, and to embrace All means of perseverance in thy Grace, And, never let the asking, or the granting, Of any necessary gift be wanting. Make us to shun and hate all things, whereby We may offend thy awful Majesty; Nor limiting thy Mercy, neither slandring Thy just Decrees, as causes of our wandring: For, no man to be wicked is inforc't, Or left by thee, untill he leaves thee first; Which all men will confess, when from their eyes That scurff is rub'd which yet upon them lies. So knit us in one True-love-knot together, By loving thee, and love to one another. That, we in all Temptations fast may stand And Sathan, nor the world dissolve that band; For, where Love in the heart keeps residence Diff'rence in Judgment, gives no more offence Then diff'ring faces, although more delight We take in those, who love and judge aright. VVhen we offend, Correct us as our Father VVith all thy Temporary scourges, rather Then suffer sins, by sins to be corrected, (VVhich is the greatest Plague can be inflicted) And that, we faint not underneath thy Rod, With stripes, mix mercy still, my gracious GOD. I ask nor Honors, Liberty, nor Wealth, Nor temporary pleasures, no nor health, Save, so far only, as thou know'st the use Of such things, to thine honor may conduce VVith our eternal safety, and the Good Of those with whom we have a Brotherhood. And, hereto I will add but this Request, (VVhich comprehends all that can be exprest) For me and mine. Oh let it, LORD, be plac't, Where it may stand, as long as Time shall last, Within thy sight; and though, nor I, nor they For whom I sue, can merit what I pray, Vouchsafe it for his sake, in whom I have So much confided, as his Boone to crave. Let us Dear GOD, from whom our Children sprung, And, all their Off-spring, whether old or young, Who, from our loins have being, or shall come Into this world, until the day of Doom, By him be so preserved, at whose cost Redeem'd we were, that no soul may be lost, Or be deprived of thy promises In passing thorow this lifes wilderness, Either by Adams fault, or our own gilt: And then, of other things give what thou wilt: For, this I value more, then if I had Thy Grant, we should all Kings and Queens be made, Possessing in this life the largest measure Of temporary honors, wealth, and pleasure. For they are Baubles, in respect of that My sanctify'd Ambition aimeth at. They who obtain'd most of them, were but slaves, VVho dropt with infamy into their Graves; And oft less misery to them befalls, VVho get their bread by cobling under stalls; Or, in this world, advanced are no higher Then raking dirty rags out of the mire. Thus I in brief have summ'd up my Request, Grant this, and let who pleaseth, take the rest. LORD, I know none, who ever heretofore Did in this mode thy Majesty implore; And, from what he believes of thee it comes, That, so to do, thy servant now presumes. Forgive me if this absolute Petition Extends beyond the bound of my Commission; For, nothing I intend, what ere I crave, Save, what thou art well-pleased I should have, VVhose will I so prefer before mine own In all things (if to me my heart is known) That whatsoever may succeed thereon Now or hereafter, Let thy will be done. My soul thou hast inclined to believe His Promises, who said, Ask, and recieve; Help then my unbelief: For if the grant Of this Petition shall that fulness want VVhich is desir'd; no want of Love in thee Occasions it, but, some defects in me; And that Obstruction which thereon is cast, Shall by thy Love removed be at last. He that in Faith and Love can to this Prayer Say for himself, Amen, shall ne'er dispair; For, it implies, he is no stranger to What man may hope for, &amp; what God will do. Newgate Feb. 1661. NIL ULTRA. Being a Soliloquie, wherein this Authour expresseth the improbability of an effectual proceeding further, in his endeavours (to prevent the Sins and Plagues increasing) by ought offered to consideration. When the Foundations are destroyed, what can the Righteous do? Psal. 1. 3. [1] I at a Nonplus am this day, And know not what to think or say, Or, what part I am next to play: That therefore which I now express, Whether the mark I miss or hit, To publick view I will commit, And leave to God the giving it, In his own time, a good success. 2 We neither love his Laws nor Him; Those men whose deeds we did condemn, We (by our imitating them) Have justifi'd in all their works. They, who have seemed self-deniers In their professing Truths, are Liars, Like Lillies look, but scratch like Briars; Talk Christian-like, but live like Turks. 3 Some say I dote; and that 'tis so, I almost am perswaded too, When I consider what I do: For, little less than doteth he, Who gives them Bread, who look for Chaff; Cast Pearls to Swine, who look for Draff; And strives to save them, who do laugh When sinking down to Hell they be. 4 Examples we have had of old, And daily we fulfill'd behold, What hath been oft of late foretold; Yet more and more besotted grow. Nor Chastisments, nor Mercy shew'd, Though oft withdrawn, and oft renew'd; Nor what hath for our sins ensu'd, Can make us heed the things we know. 5 VVhat can by me be said or done, To stop them who still headlong run, To meet the mischiefs coming on, And which already are in view? Since men will neither see nor hear VVhat is apparant ev'ry-where, Nor have Grace, Courage, Wit or Fear, VVho can prevent what may ensue? 6 How can good Sequels be expected, VVhere Truth and Reason are neglected, And gross crimes, not alone suspected, But acted also with shame? VVhere men, all Prophanations dare, In all well-doings cowards are; And seem to have nor sence nor care, Either of good, or evil Fame? 7 VVhen what relates to Earth and Heav'n, Seems of its proper use bereaven, (And what for common use was given, Made only for th'abusers sake) VVhat humane Wit can save them from A sad inevitable doom, VVho false to other men become, And Pitfalls for themselves do make? 8 VVhen first I did converse with men, They were exceeding wicked then; But now seem worse by five in ten: For, till of late I never heard, That such Abominations were, So impudently acted here VVithin this Clime, as now they are By probable Reports, aver'd. 9 If Justice executed were, If we were what we would appear, In thought, in deed, in word, sincere; Oppressors and self-seekers fewer; It might be hoped that those few, VVho to good principles are true, Might more successefully pursue, VVhat would at last, our weal procure. 10 But whilst we see one crying sin Brings ev'ry day another in, Whence new Corruptions do begin, VVhat can the Righteous hope to do; But meekly wait on GOD, (until Her measure wickedness doth fill) Submitting all things to his will, And adding their Amen, thereto? 11 VVhilst we each mangie humour claw, Turn Grand Oppressions into Law, Stand nor of GOD, or men in awe, And, Truths, by Violence confute; VVe bring but fewel to that fire, Or breath to blow the flame still higher, VVherein our hopes will quite expire; And Prudence then is justly mute. 12 For when GOD threatens Desolations, If men turn due Humiliations To Triumphs and vain Recreations; VVhat can be justly then expected? But changing hopes into despairs, More Breaches, instead of Repairs, And that our formal thanks and prayers, Should be offensive, and rejected? 13 Oft under Trust is hatched Treason, VVise to be thought, is to want Reason, Sincerity is out of season; Foundations likewise are orethrown: To speak the Truth is now a Crime; To look for Justice 'tis no time, (To be a Knave, the way to clime) And sin almost full ripe is grown. 14 My witness, therefore, having born, (Among men in the hope forlorn) I'le all alone, sit down and mourn For that which cannot prevented. My Lot, I'le meekly take with those, VVhom GOD shall unto that expose, VVhich may befall both Friends and Foes, And therewith will remain contented. 15 This now, is all that can be done; That therefore I resolving on, VVill let the world a while alone, And GOD therein to work his will? Ile only take that Ammunition, VVhich gives no just cause of suspicion, And (without seeking their perdition) Let filthy men be filthy still. 16 Thus far forth I have trod the Maze, VVithout offence to any Cause, That's justifi'd by righteous Laws; But now no further can proceed: For so Confusion here abounds, That Good and Evil it confounds, And whirls us in an endless Round; VVhich fruitless makes both word and deed. 17 For they who dance upon the brink Of Hell it self (and fondly think They are secure because they wink;) Their open danger cannot see, But are so vext to hear me tell Their Heaven borders upon Hell; That for my wishing of them well, They wish but little good to me. 18 Perhaps too, as the Round now goes, They who my good intents oppose, (And are both mine and their own foes) May seek to take my life away: If they so do; when that is done, I shall beyond their reach be gone; And he who all deeds looks upon, VVill suddenly their spight repay. 19 Yet I shall make no such Request, As may not with their weal consist: I, neither by the Sword, or Pest, Or Famine, wish aveng'd to be; Or by ought else, which might destroy The Life which here they do enjoy, (Though they that Mercy mis-imploy;) This rather shall my Prayer be, 20 Let GOD confound their pride, their hate, And all their Plots annihilate, Who shall design to practise that, Which may to his dishonour tend. Let none of those endeavours thrive, Whereby ungodly men contrive; How they another may deprive Of his just Freedom, Foe, or Friend. 21 This Deprecation doth not reach Mens Persons, or that Love impeach Which Christian Verity doth teach: For, to avenge themselves of wrong, That giveth liberty to none; But, to do good for evil done Required is of every one, To whom a Saintship doth belong. 22 The Publick Welfare I prefer Before mine own particular; And this for truth I may aver, Whoever shall the same deny: My Country, or my Sovereign Lord, Neither by actions, or by word, Or by my Pen, or by my Sword, To self-ends injured have I. 23 I have not broke my Faith to those Who did a Trust in me repose, Whether they prov'd my Friends or Foes; But did with Loyalty submit, To do, or suffer under them Who exercise the Power Supream, Which is at the dispose of Him, Who gives and takes, as he sees fit. 24 I never did for Love or Hate, Act, or design to innovate The Government of Church or State, But did my duties in my place; And when I fear'd that for our sin An Anarchy was creeping in, Endeavor'd, when it did begin, How to preserve the Common-Peace. 25 When Civil Pow'rs were so divided, That then both Fools and Wise men sided As Interest or Conscience guided, I sought not to inlarge the rent; But, being called Aid to bring, To, (and by) them, whose counselling Had been Authoriz'd by the King, I, to perform my duty, went. 26 Retir'd from Court and City then, I liv'd among plain Countrymen, Employing otherwhile the Pen, My private Musings to record; Which, I had more desire to do, Then that which I was call'd unto, Till I was importuned so, That I at last, put on my Sword. 27 To do my best, forth arm'd I came, (My Conscience warranting the same) And porpos'd nothing worthy blame, By unjust violence, or guile. For, in sincerity I thought, A course we follow'd as we ought, Whereby means might to pass be brought, Divided Friends to reconcile. 28 But so divsions them inrag'd, Who were in that Contest engag'd, And, such ill consequents presag'd, That, I my Troop did soon disband; And, hopeless I should ought assay Successful in a martial way, My Sword, and Arms quite flung away, And took my Pen again in hand. 29 Such new Adventures this began, That, I appeared to be then Betwixt the Fire and Frying-pan: For, such proceedings I espy'd; That, they who with the best intent Pursu'd the way in which they went (And ill to neither party meant) Found least respect on either side. 30 To see what was done well or ill, I had just cause, against my will, To be there, an ey-witness still, Where grand affairs transacted were. As well the Person as the Name I knew of most men, who by fame Were said to merit praise or blame, And who did best or worst appear. 31 Self-love, base Avarice, and Pride, I saw among themselves divide The publick Rights, on either side; Their Foes befriending out of season; Well-meaning Innocents destroying, Their pow'r to favour Guilt employing, And often to a self-destroying, Against their Friends committing Treason. 32 I saw both GOD and Man offended, Much finding fault, but little mended; Good Life and Piety pretended; But few whose words and works were one: They who most quarrell'd with each other, In evil so agreed together, That to repose a trust in either, I found but little cause, or none. 33 The worse men were, they seem'd the better To serve their ends, and much the fitter To be inriched and made greater. Him who did most indulge their sin; Or, to inflame their lust brought fewel; Or, were unto their foes most cruel, They kept about them as a Jewel; And, such, their chief esteem did win. 34 Such as had neither Grace nor Wit, Such as Job judged men unfit Among his Shepherds Dogs to sit; Ev'n such as were, the other day, More worthy of contempt than those Who liv'd by picking Hips and Sloes, (With such food as on Hedges grows) VVere honour'd; yea few more than they. 35 These having scratcht up wealth and power, In Court and City, Town and Tower, Did act as if our fatal hour VVere hither making an advance: The mean-while men, here, and abroad, At hazard plaid, in such a mode, (At Hide, at Even, and at Odd) As if all things were rul'd by chance. 36 Thereby my hazards greater were Than those which I had cause to fear, When War most dreadfull did appear: For, at what I before had done, One party only took offence; But, I have anger'd ever since All parties, who have lost the sence Of what they seem to carry on. 37 This made me dip my Pen in Gall, Impartially reproving all, Without regard what might befall To me, whilst just things I intended: For, alwayes I regarded so Their Honour, and their Profit too, With whom my Muses had to do, That none have cause to be offended. 38 It nev'rtheless, on me so brought Their hate, whose welfare I had sought, That of mine own they left me nought, Which might my likely want supply: No place whereon to rest my head, No certainty of daily bread, But in my old age to be fed And cloathed by pure Charity. 39 In which strait GOD provided so, That I yet live his work to do, Well pleased with my portion too; Yea, more than when it larger seem'd: For, what's bereaved was but Lumber, Which did with many cares becumber, And, is not put into the number Of things which merit best esteem. 40 I therefore, whatsoev'r befel, To High and Low did plainly tell, (Whether they took it ill or well) Such things as I thought needful were; And oft expressed with my Pen, What might minde me and other men, More heed to take, both how, and when, Unto our selves we Traytors are. 41 And time to come, when I am dead, Shall find there will be still much need To tolerate one in my stead, That may pursue what I begun. VVhen God so pleaseth, let him come To do him service in my room; And, let the Work he calls me from, Thrive better than it yet hath done. 42 My time is almost wholly past; And, thinking this may be the last, For a Nil Ultra here 'tis plac't, As having no more now to say: But if my life God longer spare, And shall my heart anew prepare, His pleasure further to declare, I'le take this Bounder-stone away. 43 I sute it thus unto these times, In that with which most fancies chimes, Expressing that in gingling Rimes, Which I suppose to be in season; Else little heed they give thereto; Or, if plain Truths observe they do, Good meanings are mistaken so, That safe it is not to speak Reason. 44 Things may result sometimes perchance, Ev'n from a trifling circumstance, Which will be helpful to advance Th'effecting of a Grand Design. Once e're Elisha would begin To speak, a Fidler was call'd in; Of use, that seem'd then to have been For his Work; so may this for mine. Man proposeth, but GOD disposeth, and his will be done. God save the King.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FIFTH COLLECTION Opobalsamum Anglicanum: AN ENGLISH BALME, LATELY Pressed out of a Shrub, and spread upon these Papers, FOR The Cure of some Scabs, Gangreeves and Cancers indangering the Bodie of this Common-Wealth; and, to whom it is now tendred, by the VVell-affected English, in a Double-Speech, disjunctively delivered, by one of their Fellow-ship, both to the Faithfull, and Malignant-Members of the Representative-Body of this Kingdome. Penned, by the Author of Britaines Remembrancer Geo: Wither Esquire. Let the righteous smite me, and it shall be a kindnesse; and let him reprove me, and it shall be an excellent Oyle, which shall not breake my head, &amp;c, VVhen their Judges are overthrowne in stonie places, then they shall heare my words, &amp;c. Psalm: 141. 5. 6. The Preface. Great hopes I had, of perfecting, e're this, My Vox-Pacifica, and songs of Peace: For, Fairfax, with his Victories, begun, So stoutly, and successefully, went on, That, neither Summers heat, nor Winters cold, Brigade, nor Army, Fortified Hold, Nor Force, nor Policy; No, nor their wiles, Who did oppose, in secret, all the whiles, Could bring his brave procedeings to a stand; Till he had marched quite throughout the Land, As in a Tryumph; And, had brought ev'n those Presuming, and proud Bragadochean-Foes, (Who had despis'd, and sleighted his beginnings) To be the sad Spectators of his winnings; And, to be prostrate-suiters, unto them, For Life, and Mercy, whom they did contemn. Our Brethren, also, and their Generall, If, we impartially consider all, From first to last (and, mar not things, in making, By rashly misbelieving; or mistaking) Have greatly added, to the hope of that, VVhich, I, and all good men have aymed at. At least, I thinke so; and will so believe, Till I shall know, that they my hopes deceive; For, I my duty, shall discharge the better: And, if they faile, their shame will be the greater. Our Parliament, hath also, done, what they VVith so distempered a Body may, (And so dismembred) labouring about The Publike-welfare; and, in working out Her Saving-Health, against those interruptions VVhich are without; and all those hid corruptions Within her Members, hindring the successe Of their Designes, and our desired Peace: And, I have waited, now, a compleat-Yeare, To heare that Voice proceed, which I did heare So long agoe; and, which, had then proceeded, If Justice had been done, and Mercy heeded But, all this time, though oft aside I, went (And, many an houre my best endeavours bent) To harken out, and bring unto this Nation, The long'd for Newes of Reconciliation, No sound, I had thereof; yet, ev'ry day, I heard those Rumours, wherewith others may, And, do delude themselves; and, must, perchance, Till they repent their wilfull-Ignorance, And take that course, which Avarice, and Pride, Hath made them wave, and, hither to deride. As when a Surgeon, who hath vndergone A Cure, and, therein, his endeavour done According to the Art by him professed; VVhen, he, the sore hath searched, clens'd, and dressed, VVith Tents, and Plaisters proper thereunto, (And, all things els, befitting him to do) If, on the Wound, his Medicine worketh nought Of that effect, which, thereby hath been sought; But, keepes it at a stand, or, makes it worse: He, presently, begins another course; And, if that, also, failes him, growes assured, It is a Cancer, hardly to be cured; And, may become a Gangreeve, which will slay His Patient, if it be not cut away. So, I, observing well, how many wayes The healing-hand of Providence, now, layes His Plaisters on our wounds; and, yet, how far Our Maladies, from perfect healing are: I, searched for the Cause, and, quickly found There was Malignant-matter in the Wound, Which would into a Cancer, be corrupted: And, peradventure (if not interrupted, By timely care) into a Gangreeve grow, Which, will effect the Bodies overthrow: Or, els (beside much trouble, griefe, and cost) Occasion many Members to be lost. Which, when I had discover'd; my true zeale, (Although I may have little thanke to deale, In such a Cure) provoked me unto That, which, most Friends and Strangers use to do When one is fallen sicke: That is, to tell VVhat, they believe or know, may make him well: And, I conceiving somewhat to that end, VVould now, performe the duty a Friend. A dangerous Disease brookes no delay: I will not, therefore, trifle time away In uselesse Prefaces: but, with what speed Is possible, will, to the Cure proceed. And, lo; the Simple, whence we will inforce A Balme to cure it, shall be this Discourse. The Wel-affected, having suffred wrong, By some, too soone intrusted, and too long, About those Cures, for which, with joynt-consent Our State-Physitians call'd a Parliament: And, they well knowing, that, this Double-Colledge, Hath neither been, through want of Care or Knowledg, Defective in their duty, or unjust; (Although some Individuals faild their trust) VVere studious, how, a course they might invent, To have the Trust-infringers roundly shent, Yet, all their Faith-full-Friends, kept free from blame: And, Providence did thus effect the fame; (By meanes of one among them, who intends To lose himselfe, e're they shall misse their ends) Upon a time (which I remember not) The Well-affected-Partie, had the lot, To meet with (but, I know not where it was) The Members of both Houses, in one Place; And, finding some occasion of their stay, (I know not how) till they their minds might say; They, having, intellectively, collected The Worthies, from the Persons-misaffected; And, with humilitie, attention pray'd, First, to the Faithfull-Members, thus they said. The Speech of the VVell-affected-English, to the Faithfull Peers, and to their constant Trustees, being Members of the honourable House of Commons. Starres, of the great, and lesser magnitude; Behold us not, as if we would intrude Upon your Orbs; nor think, this Throng appeares To interrupt the motion of your Spheares; To hinder your aspects; or, take offence At any late effect, or influence, Derived from your Power; or, at ought done By you, in both; or either House alone, When, violence their motion suffers not, Whereby prodigious things may be begot: For, so heroick, and so noble, ever, Hath been your prudence, and your stout endeavor, To keep upright the wheeles of Charles his waine; And, ev'ry harmfull Vapour to restraine, Exhald by Meteors, to the wrong of them, Whose habitations are within your Clyme; That, we confesse, with praise, and admiration, Your constant Labours, in the preservation, Of this distracted Empire; and, present All humble, and all due acknowledgment, For persevering, through those many stops, Obstructing the fruition of our hopes. We are not ignorant how many Feares, How many reall-mischiefes, Rubs, and Snares, Great hazards, hardships, murm'rings, calumnies, Scoffes, and almost-Impossibilities, You, with untired constancy have past, In hope, to wrestle out, for us, at last, The Blessing we desire: And, we confesse You, are the means of what we, yet, possesse We do ascribe, as to the Second-Cause, The preservation, of our Lives, our Lawes, Our Conscience, Liberties, and of what e're To us, or ours hath been esteemed dear, To be from you: And, we confesse, likewise, That, in your Honour, and your safetie, lyes Our safety, and our Honour; and, that, we In your well-being, judge our VVeale to be; And, ev'ry danger, and disgrace of your, To be a danger, and disgrace, of our. Excuse us therefore, if the Double-due Of what, we owe, both to our selves, and you, Produceth an Attempt and an effect, Which you do nor imagine nor expect; And, drew us to the pardonable Fault, Of making this unlooked-for Assault Upon your patience; since, the thing we do, Is that, which we appear oblig'd unto; And, tends to nought lesse, then the preservations Of you, of us, and all the British-Nations. Suspect not, our assembling, thus, together; Nor look upon us, as if we were either Of their Confederacy, or their Condition, Who come to raise an uproare, or Sedition; Or, to compell you forceably, to do What our wild Fancie hurried us unto: But, rather, pleased be to understand, That, we are of those people in the Land; Who are most peaceable; and, well content To be obedient to that Government, Which doth preserve the Freedomes of the Nation, Continuing firmly on the first Foundation; And, free from Superstructures, which pervert The works of Nature, by the Quirks of Art. We are no Partners, with those Factious-Fellowes, Who bring the fewell, or, who blow the bellowes Of Civill-Discords: nor, of those, that, Dary Their Principles, when their Designes miscarry: Nor of their Creed, who will believe no more, Then, what they have believed heretofore: Or, what their Grandsires did believe, of old; Or, what shall by their Priest, to them be told: Nor are we of their mind, who, therefore do, What they have done, because, they have done so: But, we are men, who, good advisement had Of what we do (though some, yet, think us mad;) Men, that, have all our best endeavours vow'd, To loose no Freedome Reason hath allow'd; Men, who resolve to seek a perfect way; To walk it, as uprightly, as we may; To keep unchanged, God's and Natures Lawes, And, change all other things, as there is cause. Sirs, we are they, who, for the Common-right, Began to speake, e're we began to fight; Some of us, are well known to be the men, Who, with the Purse, the Person, and the Pen, Engag'd our selves, this Quarrell to defend, Before we had an Armie, or a Friend, To ayd, or second us. We did expose Our selves, against the violence of those, Who exercise Oppressions of all sorts, In Monopolies, Arbitrarie-Courts; And upstart Offices; although it cost Our liberties, and our preferments lost, Whilst they, who such rewards to us afforded Were for their Villanies, enricht and Lorded. And, we are they who, but a while ago, When Tyrannie did so presumptuous grow, (And, to such impudency, as to dare Improve wrongs-private, into open-warre) Who did oppose it: yea, when Superstition Was, to oppresse us, joyned in Commission With Tyrannie, and these came both together So furiously, and boldly marching hither, That, justly, you began to be a fraid Of Publike-Ruine, and call'd out for ayd; We were the men; ev'n we, who first of all Came in, to your Assistance, at your call. And, when we came, we came not backward, in, Or, as if we insensible had bin Of your, as our own dangers: But, came flying, As if we heard our Wives, or Children crying, Come helpe, or we are murthred! without stay, Our Callings, and Estates we flung away: Our Plate, our Coyne, our Iewels, and our Rings, Armes, Ornaments, and all our Pretious-things, To you we brought as bountifully, in, As if they had old rusty horshooes bin: Yea, (God is witnesse with us) we, our lives, Our Parents, our dear Children, and our wives, Have often valued at so low a rate, And, so neglected them to serve the State, At your Command; as if they had not seemed Things, worthy to be any whit esteemed. Through heat and cold; through dangers &amp; through Fears; Through w?ts &amp; wo?ds; &amp; thorow swords &amp; spears. Yea (which is worse) through their neglects &amp; scorn, For whom (in part) we, all these things have born, We have adventur'd; that, we might uphold Your Honour, to the uttermost we could. Which we repeat not, to derive from thence, Selfe-praise; but, to beget a confidence In you, this day, that, we appeare as Friends With our first-love, and with as loyall ends As when we first came in to offer to you, The services, we able were to doe you: And, we are still resolv'd, if need appear, To be as free, and forward as we were, Your Dignitie, and Honor to maintain; Yea twice more, yet, and three times thrice, again. If you (which we suspect not) shall goe on, With faithfulnesse, to doe the worke begun; And, shall nor faint, nor faile, in your pursuite Of what, you are about to execute: We do ingage, with you, to fall or stand; To give assistance, both with heart, and hand, To all your just Designes; and, settle them In spight of those, who shall our hopes contemn. Yea, whether your Antagonists are they, Who, here at home, your Counsels would betray; Or, Enemies who, from abroad, shall dare Invade our Freedomes; we resolved are To stand the shock, of all their threats, &amp; powers, Be they States, Prelates, Kings, or Emperours, Or, altogether: For, what, hard can be To these three joyned? God, and You, and Wee? But, You, and Wee, (as reasonable men) Must, to God's helpe, adde our endeavors, then; Or else, both You and VVee, in vaine presume That, God our Coadjutor will become. Our best endeavours, too, must be imployed, Where we most likely are to be destroyed; Which, otherwhile, he better may discerne Who trims the Sails, then he that Guides at Stern, You are the Braine, the Liver, and the Hart Of this great Bodie, and the Vitall-part Which gives it motion: But we are the Hands, Whereby it Acts; The Feet whereon it stands; The Bulk and Bones which must the burthens bear: And, VVee with You, may claime to have a share In all the senses; and, without offence In that, which hath been cal'd the Common-sence. By us together, therefore, and alone, Our Duties must respectively be done, According to the Common-Interest, (And to the Faculties, by us possest, Vnited, and a sunder) with such care To heed each others counsels, doubts, and Feare, And with such mutuall readinesse to add All comforts, all good helpes that may be had, And all endearements, which may knit together Our Forces, and our Loves to one another, That, none may come between us; or, find way To mixe with us, our Counsels to betray. This last, will more endanger us, then all The strength of Spain and France united shall, If we prevent it not: And, there is need That, hereof, at this present, we take heed: For, of this Evill, to our griefe, we view Both symptoms and effects; yea, not a few. Most honor'd Peers &amp; Comons; whilst you wake, And watchfull are, that we no harmes may take, We sleep not so supinely, as to sleight Our own securitie, or, that which might Indanger You: And, by this meanes, our eyes And Eares, have made some late discoveries, Which, your imployments for the Publike-weale, (Or trust-abusing friends) from you conceale, With such faire guildings, that, both You and wee Are lost, unlesse they quickly heeded be; And, heeded so, that, likewise, you provide A remedy, and see the same applide: For, we have good Provisions, oft, and many; But, little execution made of any. Your Courage, and your wisdome we confesse, Your Piety, your Care, and watchfulnesse, In your own Persons; and, that, you oppose With good successe, your most Malignant Foes Which are abroad; by meanes of that dispis'd, (Yet valiant Armie) lately modelliz'd, In Gods own time: But, noble Sirs, there be Worse Foes within, then those abroad you see: And such they be, as doe require you should As much reduce your Houses, if you could, As you have done your Armie: For, we feare Disguised Foes do lurk among you there, Which need a Privy-search; &amp; one to show them, Who by their Spots &amp; secret marks, doth know them Foes, that, have put your Friends quite out of grace; Plead Priviledge of Person, and of Place: Such, as by some well-doing, now and then Have done more harm, then Troops of fighting men, And Private-Priviledges, have enjoyd, Till Publike-Freedomes, are almost destroyd. Hîc Dolor, Worthies! all our doubts are here; Hence, is our greatest Grievance, and our Feare. We sleight as Trifles, all the Frights and Foes, Which, some, for our discouragement propose To be considered on. We sleight all that, Wherewith we have been menaced of late; Aswell the threats of open-Foes, at home; As those, which from beyond-Sea hither come. The Cavaleers, who swagger up and downe, And mixe among us, now, in every Towne, And Country village (with their foolish brags) We fear no more, then when their Feather wags. Although the King should frowardly be bent Against the Propositions you have sent, Or, by delaying his assent, delay That Blessing, which we look for every day; It would not startle us: Nor, do, we fear Those Inconveniences which may appear Drawne on us, by the Prince his running from The Kingdome, whereto he was praid to come, To make a misadventure into France: Nor, how, the Queene her Projects may advance By that occasion: For, God's providence Hath, for our good, it may be, sent him hence: And, we may find, when all accounts are cast, Their Losses, will be greatest at the last. Our hearts it not a whit discourage can, That some have hopes, the Hollander or Dane, May by perswasions, their own fingers burne To do their Neighbours, here, an evill-turne, Which, (ere the Cup, now filled, hath gone round) Unto their own destruction may redound: Nor feare we those Alliances, with which Great Princes, one another doe bewitch, And, knit themselves together in a band, Which binds, them like a Cable made with Sand. Nor are we frighted, with the Leagues of those, Which have been old confederated Foes Against this Kingdome, though we often heare Of mighty men, who, in their Cause appear; And, of great sums, rais'd by their Munks and Fryers (Whose brats, men say, sit by their neighbours fires) Though Fame reports of many Horse and Men, Which they will set aflote (they know not when) With Ships and Armes, and other things in hope, Beside the Curse and Blessing of the Pope, We feare them not: for God, before they come, May, peradventure, find them work at home; Or they will (as of old) but make a crack, And funck, and smoke a little, and fall back: Since, they who act their Catholick-Designes Observe the Principle, Selfe-Love injoynes, As men do here; and will no longer drive Their neighbors Car; then they thereby may thrive: Yea, we our selves, by dear experience, know That, Ayd soone promis'd, is in comming, slow. Nor fear we, that, our Armie, or the Citie, (As they who more suspitious are then witty, Suspect of late) will any thing assay, But, that, which they with your good liking may, Whilst firme to your own Principles you stand; And, act not with your left-malignant hand. Nor do we fear a breaking with the Scot; For, greater cause of fear they give us not, By ought we see then some of us have given To them, of late; So, we and they are even, In giving Cause; as, we hereafter shall In ruines be, if we asunder fall. Nor fear we (though reviv'd among us are, Old-Prophesies, which put Young-fooles in fear) That they who do with Ireland, now, begin, Shall not give off, till England they do win: For, till our wickednesse doth here increase To equall us with them, in barbarousnesse, (And bloody crying-sinnes) there is no dread, Of being, by those Blood-hounds conquered, Or, any other; if we will prevent The threatned Plagues, by being penitent; And, ere it be too late, some course foresee To scape those Foes, that mixt among us be. These are the Foes, whom most of all we fear, And, those, of whom we wish you to beware. For, without these, all other, outward Foes, Would prove like ragges, set up to scar the crowes; And, harme us, by their furiousnesse, no more, Then Paper-guns discharg'd against the shore. Nay, other Foes would be occasion, rather, To make us prudently more strength to gather; Arme us within, against our Foes abroad; And, make us sly unfainedly to God. But, these, if long conniv'd at, will be able To make the meanest Rascals formidable, That shall oppose us: These, will skrew into us, If suffred) Principles, that, will undo us VVithout another Foe, and draw us, on, To trust in our own wits, as they have done; And leave our Faith and confidence in God, To seek our happinesse, in flesh and blood: These, have, already, made us, grow afrayd Of those, that are our Friends, and bring us ayd; Yea, fearfull of our selves; nay, of our shade, And, things, by meer imagination, made. These, will deprive us, e're perceiv'd they are, Both of the Bones and sinewes, of the VVar; Steale from us, to be Factors for their ends, Our Wives, our Children, and our bosome-friends; Enfeeble, by degrees, the publike-strength, And, altogether, ruine us at length. That, you may know, we speak the truth of these; Observe it, now, in practise, if you please: For, you your selves, have seen with lamentations, Their practises, and their prevarications. Behold, your Friends and servants are disgrac'd; Malignants, in Authority, are plac'd; They, who inform you, how we are abus'd, Are for Suborners, shamelesly accus'd, And, voted such, without due proofe or hearing; Or, any probability appearing. They, who came, first, our Freedomes to redeem, Are set among the hindmost, in esteem: Even by their prevalency, who, conceale Their disaffections, to the Common-weale. These, by their cruelty, injustice, pride, And wicked practises, have justifide All Courts and Persons, that corrupt have bin, Before this Reformation did begin: And, these, by fooling some, and failing more; By making Villaines rich, and good men, poore; By sleighting others; by oppressing many, And, seldome doing Justice unto any, Have so displeased, and inraged so, The generalitie, that, mad they grow; And, are upon the point, if none prevent, Of shewing symptoms of their discontent. And, upon whom, do your Malignants lay The blame of this? who, do these (think you) say, Is cause of all our Troubles, and distractions? Of our oppressions, and our large exactions, But, ev'n this Parliament? nay, many a one, VVho for this Parliament, hath said and done, And suffred much; begins to think the same: And, that, the best among you are to blame, In most that is amisse: because, they see Their known Oppressors, kept among you be. VVhat would this come to, if the many cryes, Of men opprest, should make the People rise? And, like a furious whirl-wind, hurry hither, Newters, Malignants, Friends and Foes together, In such a posture, as a Multitude Disordered comes? how, could it be withstood? VVhat, could be done or said, that, might asswage The roarings, of such Waters, when they rage? Then, what, your packt and false Committees vote, VVould not be valu'd at an old crackt groat: Nor would the people, in their fury hear you, Although both Houses, should assent to clear you. None, would be able to distinguish, then, Betwixt the Faithfull, and the Faithlesse men, VVho, had occasion'd this: But, while you have Their Company, their sins to you will cleave; And, nothing will be able to prevent Your sharing, in their shame and punishment: For, these, we fear, would hardly be so tame, As He, who, but to seize Five Members came. Or, if th'offenders, who, now home are brought, Should practise (as tis likely some are taught) To work upon the peoples discontent, And, so much their distempratures foment, As, that, they should withdraw away from you, Their former Love; or, their obedience due, To your Commands: or, make them colder, in Their zeale, then they, in former time, have bin How, would it all our present hopes indanger? How would it hearten an invading-stranger? How would it please, and reincourage those, VVho seem your Friends, but, till they may be Foes And, then, how nimbly would your False-ones prove That mischiefe, for their purpose, to improve? How quickly, then, would many turn upon you, VVho, hitherto, have outside-service done you? How many scandals, would there, then, be rais'd, From actions, which are, at this present, prais'd How many flatring Priests, who, now applaud Your courses? and, ascribe the praise and laud Which you deserve; would say as much for them, VVhose practices, both you, and they condemn? And, then, what will it profit those among Your Members, who delight in doing wrong, That they when an apparent wrong they do, Shall add a greater injury thereto, To cleare themselves of what they were accus'd? What, will it profit them, to have abus'd The well-affected, by unjust proceeding, And false reports, the Parliament misleading, To cast a heavy censure upon those As wilfull Malefactors, or, as Foes, Who, if impartially they had been heard, Instead of punishment should have reward? VVhat will it them availe, by saving, thus, Their credit for, a while, by wronging us, If they at last, be to those Judges turn'd, By whom their power and censures will be scorn'd? Excuse us, if our love and faithfull care Compell us, plainly to expresse our feare, By these Expostulations; and to vent Our councells thus, beyond all president: For, neither have our dangers, nor our crimes, Had any president in former times; Nor can we think our selves, from treason free, If, in these perills, we should silent bee. Oh! let us not be judged to exceed Our Bounders, at a time of so much need; Nor, suffer us, who seek but to maintain Your honour, and your lives, to speak in vain: But, rather, purge, or cure, or cut away Your Gangreev'd-Members, with what speed you may. If, you suppose there are no such among you, As we suspect; that, thought wil greatly wrong you. And, bring you all in danger, by degrees, Of dying without sense of your disease. You know, there have been breakers of their trust, And, many Members heretofore unjust In both your Houses: And, why may not there Be such among you, as aforetime were? Nay, who can think there are not, who doth see What oppositions, yet, among you be? For, where much disagreement, see you shall, There, out of question, some are naught, or all; Since bitter Factions, rarely have been made, But, where are to be found, both good, and bad, Or all corrupted. And, the man who sayes That, none, among you, walks corrupted wayes, Is, doubtlesse, one of those, who hath deserv'd, To have his wayes and walkings well observ'd. Are none of those, think you permitted, yet, In either House of Parliament, to sit, Who, when the City should have been betray'd, Did know of it? think you, when VValler say'd, (To strengthen his Confederates) that, he Knew many, who therety, would aiding be In either House? think you, he should have had His pardon; if none fear'd he could have made The saying true? Or, that, he naming none, Should, into banishment, so cheap have gone, Unlesse, because, he could have named so many, That, if the Houses should have questioned any, It might have brought upon us, at that season, A danger, almost equalling the Treason? VVhat ere ye think, we think, this was the cause, VVhy he, who was in breaking of the Lawes, The Principall, escap'd with life, when they That Accessaries were, their debts did pay: And, are we bound to think now VVallers gone, That, here, of his Confederacie are none, VVhile we perceive Delinquents so defended, As yet, they are, and we so ill befriended? VVho, in both Houses, would have scorned more To hear such questions asked, heretofore, Then Strafford and the Prelate, who, are now A headlesse paire? And, which is he of you Among the Commons, who injoy'd a name More honourable, and a fairer fame Then Hotham had? which of you stood so strong A charge as he? and, held it out so long VVithout recoyling? Or, ingag'd this Nation Unto him, by a greater obligation, Then he did, for the time? And, yet, at last, You saw he fell; because, he had not plac't, The Structure, (though 'twere strong) upon those rocks, That could abide reiterated shocks. And, if men, in desert so eminent, (Till we discover'd in what path they went) Fell from that bravery in resolution, And, so much constancy in execution, Then well may we distrust that, some of those VVho, at this present make faire seeming showes. May possibly be false? At least, when they Have trodden heretofore beside the way, And, are at present probably suspected; Though, they in some things, faithfully have acted? Since, we have oft, experience had, that, none Have to the Common-wealth, more mischief done, Then some, who, for a while, have, had the fame Of Patriots; and, did but play that game, Till they had opportunity, to catch That grace at Court, for which they lay at watch. And wherfore should it seem to wrong the rest, If, we have jealousies of some exprest, Who gave us cause? (And, if no cause there be) What mean those symptoms, which, thereof we see? Wherefore, do some of you, yourselves bewaile, As if you felt some limbs of your to faile? VVhy do you halt, somtimes, and are so slow, At other times, when you should faster go? And, find defects among you, now and than, VVhich frustrate good designs, do what you can? VVherefore, so frequently, do you divide, As if you had a Palsie, on one side? And, often, have so much ado to stay Your Votes, from running on the left-hand-way? Yea, wherefore, do the best among you find Some failings, of your fellowes, in this kind, If none be questionable? Or, if we Offend, in saying such among you be, Why, are there daily, strivings in your wombe, As if Rebecca's twins, again, were come To be new born? and, to afflict the Mother, By strugling how, they may supplant each other? Why, are complainings, if no wrongs be done? Who can Oppressors be, if, there be none VVithin your Houses? Or, if none of your Corrupted-members, have abus'd their Pow'r? Since, all Oppressors, ev'ry other where, May have, or, ought to have, redresses there? As Samuel said to Saul; if none are spar'd Whom God condemns, whence are these bleatings heard, Which fill our eares? How, come th'Amalakites To be so jocund, and the Israelites So much dis-heart'ned? VVhat mad-men are they, VVho bring Petitions, almost ev'ry day, Against your Members? And, wherefore do some (Although, they pris'ners for it are become) Still prosecute their charge, and Plaints, as far As men imprisoned enabled are, Against those men; if, really they be From Guiltinesse, and just Suspition free? And, why, are not Accusers dayly hear'd, That, knaves may punish'd be, and good men clear'd If, all are in their actions so upright, VVhy do not they, on whom aspersions light, Offer themselves to tryall by the Lawes, According to the merit of the Cause, VVithout respect of Persons; that, the greev'd May in their suffrings duly be releev'd? The mouth of clamour stop'd, if she hath made An out-cry, when no cause, at all, she had? And, that, all men who truly guiltlesse are, May not in scandalls, with men guilty, share? VVhy should you, like the Benjamites connive At wickednesse, untill Gods Justice drive The much incensed-people, of the Land, To come, and to require it, at your hand? Nay we draw nearer: VVhy, have you so long, Pursu'd the King, because he did us wrong, To keep from censure, those, who merit blame; If, you your selves, have done the very same? VVhy, may not we as justly question them, VVho break their trust to us; as, you do him? And, hope, that, GOD will find us out a way, VVereby, the Common-wealth deliver may Her self from those, that, her Trust-breakers be, (In most convenient time) aswell as he, Gave us this Parliament, ev'n when else, none, Knew how, without Rebellion, to have done, VVhat, now, we do? although the King had broke That Trust, wherewith, the Crown he undertook. Consider this; and, keep your selves, and us From straights, and courses, which are hazzardous Least you both loose the glory you have got, And, feel a mischief, when you fear it not. For, if you do not wicked men protect; Yet, while their prosecutions you neglect, You may incurre the curse of their offence, VVho do the work of God, with negligence; And to destruction, all your friends expose, By beeing too indulgent to your Foes. Let GOD, or Baal be serv'd: For, hate we do Those, that are alwaies halting between two. All they, who in simplicity of heart, Adhere to one, though to the worser part, Are, so far in the way of walking right, That, those we hate not, though with them we fight. Nor shall we fear, when reconcil'd these be, But, that, they will be found as true as we. Take not we pray you, this free-powring out Of Gileads Balm, as if we went about A needlesse Cure: Or, would have men believe VVe did annoint, when blowes, &amp; wounds, we give; Nor think, we rub too hard: For, we are friends (VVhat ere we may be thought) whose love intends Your honour with your weal: And, having found How to advance them, do as we are bound. VVe are no Mountebanks, who would endear Our Surgery, by putting you in feare Of greater dangers, then indeed are found: But, we would search the bottome of the wound; Because, we cannot perfectly be heal'd, Till all our kown corruptions, are expel'd. VVe know no means of saving you, and us, But, by plain dealing; and, by speaking thus; That you may take some wise, and speedy course, To stop this mischief, ere it groweth worse. The Common remedies, are at a losse; The Sanctuary gold, is mixt with drosse; And, there's no meanes to part them, which wee know But, by attempting that, which we do now: Nor can you save your honor, (though you save Your selves) if long, you ill companions have. For, what your evill Members, have mis-done, Upon your score, is ev'ry day set on, As well as your best deeds: and, in your faces Their dirt is hourely flung, to your disgraces. Those Resolutions which conduce unto The Publike-weale, want but a Voice, or two, Somtimes, of being lost: Such are their wiles, Or, such their number: And, if otherwhiles They carrie on a Vote, in your despight, That seems not to advance the publike-right, You beare the blame thereof, as much as they: Yea, to the Parliament, the People lay, Not onely, that which is concluded on In either House, although the same were done By some unjust contrivance: But, it beares The faults of ev'ry Member, too, of theirs, Whose life is scandalous; yea, it pertakes In blame with him, for each known scape he makes. For, when abroad the Common-people heare A Member of your Houses, lie, or sweare, Or, some of them, no conscience make to pay Their long due debts; when, well enough they may; Or, see them reeling out of Tavern doores; Or, impudently, courting of their Whores; Or some such way imployed: Oh! how quick, They shoot at you their Arrowes! and, how thick! Some say in scorn; and some, in discontent; These, are the Members of our Parliament: These, ase those Worthies, that, must set us free From Tyrannie: These, our Deliv'rers be: These are the Chosen ones, who to this Nation Must bring the blessing of a Reformation: Yea, these, whom here you thus debauched see, Pertaining, to the Honest-party be, Or to the Godly; the Malignant sayes: And, on them, descants many other waies, With such like scoffings, as no modest ear Can without grief, or indignation heare. All which, reflects on you, who are the best; And, so it will, till you reforme the rest. How can you be insensible of this? And, since an injurie suppos'd it is, To let aspersions, on one Member fall; Why brook you them, who scandalize you all? Why keep you those unquestion'd, who are thought Blame-worthie; till, the blame on all is brought? If you seem all concerned, though but one, Be some way toucht, as if he had misdone; How much more are you scandaliz'd if they Who justly do accuse, have cause to say, They could not have their Informations heard; Nor legall-tryall; nor, their due regard? How doth this scandalize you, if, when we (As by our Covenant injoynd we be) Have Informations brought, which closely touch, On what concernes the publike-safety, much, We have, not onely, waited with submission, And hearing sought by Speech, and by Petition; But, persevered, also, weeks of dayes, Nay, months and years; and, then, tir'd with delays, Gave off, because, we none, that while, could find, To heed our Cause, or, bear the same in mind? How scandalous is this? 'Tis either true, That, in your Houses, there be very few Affecting Justice; or, they hardly found; Or, that in their employments they abound; Or, else, that they perceive the question'd-crime, Would come to tryall, in an evill time. This saves your Credits: For, God hath a season For every thing: and (though you see no reason, Of such, and such obstructions, or delayes) Doth all things timely; and walks prudent wayes. And, peradventure, he will now, begin To do, what hath so long deferred bin. VVork you, with him; as, also, we intend; And, he shall give our hopes, a happy end. Take not thereat offence, as if, we wrong you, VVhen we affirme there are false-men, among you. VVhy seemes the scandall, any whit the more, To have this spoken at the Senate-doore, Then, to be made the common talke, of all VVho travaile through the streets, or walk the hall? VVhat are men lesse dishonored, though none dare, In print, to publish, that, they traytors are? If ev'ry man, almost, who hears their names Thinks, knowes, &amp; speaks of their deserved shames? And, wonders, that, no Member, no Committee, No County, Corporation, Towne, or City, Takes thought to question them? or, forth to learn The truth of that, which doth so much concern The Common-Peace? For, 'tis no work for one, Except for him that meanes to be undone: So chargeable, so troublesome, they make it: So long; so dangerous, to undertake it. These things, we mention not to be the least Detraction from your dues, or interest; Or, from your Honour: or, because, we grudge You, or your Houses any Priviledge That may preserve your Persons, or that Power, VVhich may be for the Publike-weale, with your: But, we would only mind you, to have care No other, make them larger, then they are, Both to th'indamaging of Vs and You; VVho know, that, all the Priviledges due To Publike Persons, were, at first, bestowne More for the Publike-sake, then for their own, And, presently, are forfeited; if, used Beyond their bound, or, any way abused. VVhen Cato, that great Senator of Rome, VVhose dignity, it did as well become, As any mans here living, to have claym'd Those Priviledges, whereat, some have aym'd: Although his Innocence was oft abus'd, And, He, no lesse, then fifty times accus'd By false Informers; and, though, thereupon The Senate, thought to have decreed, that, none The boldnesse should assume, in future time, To charge a Senator, with any crime, Not sully prov'd against him; Cato, rose, And, their intention, stoutly, did oppose. By this Edict, said He, we should deprive The Common-wealth, of that preservative, VVhereon her Safe-subsistence, much depends: This, would secure her Foes, destroy, her Friends And, make it faser, Treason, to commit; Then, to endeavour, for preventing it. He, that shall give occasion of suspition, Hath, so far, forfeited the true condition Of one in Innocence; that, he must bide The rubbings of the Test, till he be tride; And, cannot, justly, say, it is a wrong To beare, what to purgation, doth belong: Since, ev'ry man is bound, as well to shun Appearances of Ill, as, evill-done: Else, to submit (for giving of offence) Unto the tryall of his Innocence. Suspected-men, therefore, if innocent, VVith noble Cato, rather, are content To stand accus'd; and, guilty to appear Some space, then, willingly, to leave a fear Upon the Publike; or, to countenance A Custome, which might Treacherie advance; Or, bar a needfull, or, a just-proceed, Against those men, who guilty are, indeed. But, faulty-men accus'd (if, still, they find Their power continue) fee'l another mind. Unto their guiltinesse, they malice add; They grow revengfull, mischievous, and mad, Plunge, in the toile, strive, strugle, scratch and tear Rage like a Tyger, roar out like a Bear; And are so netled, that, you may behold Their guiltinesse, before the same is told; Yea, and by hearing them, e're them you see, May know what Vermin, and, what Beasts they be. These things consider, with a serious thought, And, let to triall, ev'ry man be brought Who hath deceiv'd his trust; or, ought, neglected, Or done, whereby, false-dealings, are suspected. If you intend, in safety to remaine; Hear all, who, reasonably, to you complain: And, judge with Righteous Judgment, that, God may Delight to be among you, all the day; That, all your Members, may be men approved; And, Iealousies and grudgings, be removed; So, you shall strengthned be, in one another, And, knit, with such assurances, together, That, there shall neither be, in all your actions, Frauds, failings, fears, repentings, or distractions. So shall the Peoples hands with you be strong, And, we in hope, of that which doth belong To our just Rights. Then, all your open-Foes Their greatest strength; their greatest hope shall lose, And, all their new-designes, and jugling plots, With Vs, the French, Danes, Hollanders, or, Scots, Shall come to nought; or, by preventing-grace, Redound unto the welfare of this place. Then, you shall get Confederates, and Friends, Who, heeding, with your just, and prudent ends, That power and Counsell, timely, you provide; Will think, they in your Friendship, may confide. And, then, we, likewise, whom you oft have tride, Will, firme, to you, at ev'ry need, abide; Still, freely hazard all our lively-hood, Our Limbs, our Lives, and our dear Childrens blood, To vindicate our Birth-rights, and our Lawes, In spight of all th'opposers of our Cause. Yea, if the much desired Reformation, Of those, who are the Chosen, of our Nation, You shall begin; we, will to you adhere So closely, that, you shall not need to fear Effecting it; although, of Trustie-men, There were not, in both Houses, five times ten: For, we are confident, halfe of that number, Well rouz'd, would wake us all, out of our slumber: Strike terrour, into all the hearts, of those Who dar'd, that undertaking, to oppose; And, make (when their Foundation they had laid) Malignancie, and Tyrannie, afrayd. We are as confident, (and, to this Nation, We dare assure it, on our Reputation, And, on our Lives) that, if, you shall go on, To do this Work, as, yet, it may be done; You should, not only, shew the VVordly-wise, How far, just-dealing, out strips Policies; But, also you shall honestie reduce To practice; bring true Pietie in use; And, build up such a Fabrick, in this Land, Of Prudent-Government; that, it should stand To be a pattern, for all Christendome; And, flourish, till the Son of God, shall come. But, if you hear us not, with such respect, That our just-motion, may have due effect: Then, know fró us (for, 'twill be worth your knowing) That, down the Hill of ruine, you are going; That, all things you shall order, or ordaine, Vote, or debate on, will be done in vaine: That, by our Contributions, and our Ayd, Destruction, shall be, for while, delayd, But, not prevented: That, the Hypocrites, Shall do you, for a while, as great despights, As have been, lately, done unto you, here, By our prophane, and, Godlesse-Cavaleer; And, that, God shall give back again these Lands Into this Kings, or, some worse Tyrants hands; Till, his Avenging-power, hath rooted hence, All those, who, without either care, or sense, Of publike miseries; of private woes; Of their own fall; of others overthrowes; Of either God or man; of heav'n or hell; Have spurned, at the way, of doing-well. For, let us not suppose, that, we may trust Upon our Cause, though, that be very just. The Iewish-cause was good: yet on them, fell Destruction, for not handling of it well, And, for Injustice; wherein, we offend So grosly, that, unlesse we soon amend, God will put off (if we can truth presage) The VVorke now doing, till the following age: And, then, shall rise another Generation, And make compleat, that work of Reformation, Which now is hindred, by the cunning sleights Of Tyrants; Hypocriticall-deceits; Selfe-seekers; and the Avarice and Pride, Of some, who seem to take the better side. And, that, which hath by Iehu, been begun; Shall, by Elisha perfectly be done. But, we, no longer, Noble Senators, Will tempt your patience, or oppresse your ears With our bold pleadings; left, by speaking much, We unawares, upon some strain may touch, Which by our ill expression, or mistake, Us, to miscensures, liable may make. What e're we say, be pleased to believe We, would not, willingly, occasion give, Of your displeasure; or, of discontent To any Member of this Parliament That, maketh conscience of his publike-trust; Much lesse, would we in any thing, disgust The whole, conven'd together; or, forget Our selves so far, as to dishonour it: Or, draw one Line, that really, might shame Or, shadow, any Glory of the same. To witnesse, that we mean the thing we say, The faults now found, our purpose is, to lay On those, with whom we found them, and with whom To chide a little, we, are hither come. On those, alone, to whom reproofes are due; On those, whose falshoods, have dishonour'd you, By thrusting in, among you; Ev'n, on those, The burthen of our Speech, we will impose: And, (by your Favour) as we cause do find, Speake, now, to them, a parcell of our mind. “The Welaffected, when they ended had “This Speech, unto the Faithfull-Members made, “Paws'd, for a while; to mark, if an assent “Were likely to be granted, with content, “To their desire of Leave, to speak their thought, “Of, and to those, by whom, our Woe is wrought; “And, ghessiing (by their grave, &amp; gracious smiling) “Them, to that motion, not to be unwilling; “They made a low obeysance: Then, withdrew “A little back; and, taking into view “The Trustlesse-Members, fixt, on them their eyes; “And, with a Speaking-frowne; spoke, in this wise. The Speech of the Wel-affected, to their perfidious-Trustees, dishonouring the Parliament, by deserting the same, or, by not acting cordially therein. Stand off, ye Traitors; that, me may not smutch A Blameles-Member, whilst your faults we touch: Stand further off, we say; lest, whilst we speak, Some Foolish-fellow may our words mistake; And, think; we have a purposed intent To lay aspersions on the Parliament. Stand, yet a little further, from among them; That, every man may see we would not wrong them, But, rather, do them honour by assayng To helpe prevent their scandall and betraying, By making, ev'ry wronged Subject know From whom, their troubles, and oppressions flow. So; being singled out, as you are, now, None, but a Brainlesse-Foole, or, some of You, Can be so impudent, as to apply Our Checks, to that High-Courts indignity; Or, seem displeas'd, because, our minds we say As fearlesly, as honest Freemen may; Since, we presume no further, then to do, That, which necessity compels us to; And, that, which being longer time delayd, May come too late; and, quite in vain, be said. When first this Parliament conveen'd together, Who cal'd for such as you? How came you hither? Confesse the truth; are not you some of those, Who made the Burgers drunk, when you were chose? Or, bribed them, with hopes, that, when you dye, You would bequeath their Towne a Legacie? Or, be, at least, so neighbourly unto them, As none of those discourtesies to do them, Which, must, undoubtedly, have been expected, If, they your profer'd service, had neglected? Though now you look upon us, as if we Your Vassals, and your slaves, e're long should be; Are not you some of those, who came, and went And spake, and wrote, and su'd for our consent? Were not you they, who trotted up and down, To every Inne, and Alehouse in the Town, To gain a Voice? Did not you, for your ends, Crouch to your equals; importune your Friends; Court your Inferiors; scrape acquaintance, with Meer Strangers; Feast, the Cobler, and the Smith? Nay more; upon the drunken Tapster fawne, And, leave your word and promises in pawne With Chamberlaines, and Hostlers, that, they might Be Factors for you, being out of sight; To move the Customers, who had a Voice, To make you Objects, of their servile choice? Sure, you are some of them, although we see, A Metamorphosis in you to be, Which puts great distances, 'twixt what you are, And, what, but some few years agoe, you were: For, we, that were your equals, or your betters, Are, to your courtesie, no common debters, If you will condescend, to let us know, We do not out of your acquaintance grow; Which we shall hazard, too, unlesse we seem To have your wisdome in most high esteem; And in your sayings, doubtlesly, confide; Although, you know, we know, your Worships li'd. When, first, your Fellowes left us, you, are they Who, having not the grace to run away, Abode behind, to see that service done, Which, had been mist, if all the Knaves had gone. For, (give the Devill his due) had you not staid, Our Counsels, and our Cause to have betrayd, This Warre, whose date, as yet, we do not know, Had quite been ended, nigh four years ago: Which, whilst such Vipers, we, among us, cherish, Will have no end, till You, or VVe, shall perish. Heare, therefore, now, a sober word or twain, Lest, you repent your wilfulnesse, in vain. Stop your Career, before it be at height, And, face about, ye Madmen, to the right. We wish not your destruction or your shame, Nor, take we pleasure to divulge your blame, Though you maligne our weal: Take therefore, heed To what we say; and, wherein you proceed. Be not so overdaring in your sin; Let, such your pay be, as your work hath bin. Or, lest, you rowle your selves, if you persever, Down to that pit, whence no man can deliver. For, though you think your walkings are conceal'd; Your secret paths and courses be reveald. Your private Aymes, your Avarice, your Pride, Your fraud, and double-dealings are espide; And, we perceive the guildings, and the paint, Wherewith, your cursed Projects you be-saint. Though some of you, your selves have falsly nam'd The Godly; and some other of you sham'd The Honest-partie, by pretending to What, you had never, yet, the thought to do, Your grand Hypocrisie, the people notes, Both in your Vowes, and selfe-denying-Votes; And how you cheat, delude us, and oppresse With mock-showes, of dissembled Holinesse. They mark, how you perform your Declarations; Your Orders, Covenants, and Protestations; And, when your turnes are served, with what pride, You cast your Promises, and Friends aside. They have observed, what Designes you drive; Whose game you play; whose profit, you contrive; How, though with with faces toward us you row, Quite from us, your intentions are to go: And, by the preparations, for the Scœne, We finde what, you to put in action mean. It is observ'd, how, some of you desire 'Twixt us and Scotland to renew the fire; And, how you wish occasions may be given, That, they by force of Arms might hence be driven, Whom you invited in: As if, God tooke No notice, when your Covenant were broke In wishes and desires, whilst you are free From breaches of your Faith that actuall be: Whereas, in vain an outward Truth, you shew; Unlesse, the purpose of the heart be true. They have observ'd, how, some of you, as wide From Moderation, on the other side, Have by pretending fairly with the Scot, Endeavor'd how those plagues may be begot, Which in appearance, you would fain prevent; And, how, you sow the seeds of discontent. You work upon the weakest of both Nations, By secret ties, or open Aggravations Of those discouragements, which they have had; Or, of those failings, which by them were made, By those Decoyes, which best can use the wing, The foolish Ducks into your snares ye bring; And, whatsoever way your Grandees go, Your Party takes, like Wild-geese, in a row. It is observ'd what mischiefes you intend, By seeming friendlie, where you are no Friend; By slandring of their Pietie and Zeale, Whose valour, hath preserv'd the Common-weal; And, by contriving, and dispersing lies, To breed distrusts and softer Jealousies. Apparent are, your Projects on the City; Your Arbitrarie straines, in each Committee. To worke the people into discontent, And bring an Odium on the Parliament. 'Tis seen, how, needlesly, you oft protract By long delayes, what, you with speed, might act. 'Tis seen, how, to accommodate each other, Ev'n you that are at odds, can joyn together Against the publike, and exchange as friends, Your curtesies, to further private ends. How, in Petitions, you confound and cumber Your selves, and us, by taking without number, Or order, Causes in; and, heeding neither Right wrong or method, shuffle all together Into a Chaos; where, we find our grief, Increased, by endeavouring for relief. And, otherwhile, your malice doth make void Those Orders, too, whereby might be injoy'd The Parliaments intentions, to relieve Those, whom the Foe, or, our own Party grieve; And, by pretending justice, dares abuse The justice, and the wisdome of the House. For, when their order shall concern the right Of any man, to whom you bear a spight, 'iTs but an Order (sleighting it) you say, Got from the House upon some busie day, Without Commitment, or Report thereon, As if, all right were at Committees done: Or, as if you impli'd, that, times there are, Or, opportunities, (if watch'd they were) In which, your Houses well considered not, VVhat we petitioned, or what they vote: Whereas, indeed, there's nothing done amisse In Parliament, but that which granted is On those Reports, which false Committees make: For, every man almost, doth notice take, How, they are managed; how, they are made, By those, who are Crafts-Masters in the trade: How, they are brought to meet, or keep away, As, this, or that man, it advantage may: And, how, when their debates are at an end, You can, when up Reports are drawn and pen'd, Insert a sentence, word, or circumstance VVhich may' the Cause mar, hinder, or advance As you shall please: And, by this cunning way, The Parliament, to scandalls you betray, VVhen manifold affairs compell them to Commit some, to such hypocrites you. VVe likewise more then jealousies have had That some of you, have Agents here been made, For Royalists: And, that, you had at Court, Your Factors, and your Leagers to report Your services, for them performed here; And, to the King, your persons to endear. We hear, whose peace was made; who also made it, VVith what respect, and on what terms he had it; VVho did his lodging at the Court provide; And guesse we do, why here he doth abide. VVe could declare, which of you had intentions To fly to Oxford, and, by what preventions You stayed, when you purposed to have went, VVe know who raised horse; who, money sent; And who did other services which you Are loath to heare of, least we prove them true. For, of such things, you guilty know other; In private, you discourse of them together; And, hear them spoken of from day to day, Yet question not the speakers; nor give way To those that would; except, it may be, there, VVhere, you who are accus'd permitted are To hear, examine, and debate the cause, Contrary both to conscience, and the Laws: By which means, some have traitors been so long, That, now, to question them, it seems a wrong, Because, they were not question'd heretofore; As if that 'took off guilt, which makes it more; Or, as if 'twere a clearing men from sin, To let them live unquestioned, long, therein. But, doubtlesse, if the blood of one man spilt Ten years ago, makes nothing lesse his guilt, Who did the murther; we no reason see How, they, who traytors, to the publike bee, Excusable, or innocent should grow, By having many years continued so; And, who by scaping their just doome, so long, Encrease our private, and the publike wrong. Can ever we have hope, that such as you, VVill to the Common-Liberties be true; VVho, to infringe our Freedoms did begin Ere into Trust, you had admitted bin? And screwed your selves into it by those wayes, Which neither are our profit, nor your praise? You thought it not enough, that, you had got, (By practises, which Law alloweth not) Your selves, made Members of this Parliament; But, also, for the better settlement, Of your Designes; you seek to bring in those Who in your purposes with you may close: And, to that end, intrude upon the right, Of other men, with all your wits and might. You ride, and send; you promise and intreat; Feast some; speake others faire; some others threat; And, many other diligences use, The soon deceived people to abuse; That, you may draw them to confer their Voices, On men, who are not their, but your own choices. From which high impudence, and bold intrusion, We make this undeniable conclusion; That, now, the ordring of the Common-Cause, Our Liberties, Lives, Liveli-hoods, and Lawes, Is in the power of many, who were chose Not, by our Countries friends; but by her Foes; And, such as had nor wit, nor care to know, On whom, the Publike-trust, they did bestow. And, if in this proceeding you go on, What can we hope will follow thereupon? But, that, if long this Parliament should sit, Your Members, still, new-members would beget On ev'ry Corporation, Shire, and Towne, Till they had made their Members so their own, That, our free choise were generally lost, As at this present day it is almost. For, on the VVrits injuriously you seize; You put them back or forward as you please; And, whereas, if they had come forth together, And, been within some little time sent thither Where choise was to be made; more satisfaction, It would have given us; and drown'd that Faction Whose manifold corruptions made you doubt Those new Elected-ones, would purge them out: But you contriv'd it so, that they must come, By one and one, or else by some and some, That they the better may be prepossest (Before they know the publike-Interest) By you to your advantage; who intend By making show, of a Religious end, And holding up two Factions to abide The safer; till, you better can provide. And, you are they, who when you in are taken, Had rather three whole Kingdoms should be shaken Then your least Priviledge dispens'd withall, What reasonable barre soe're befall. No men are halfe so zealous in that cause As you, by whom our liberties and Lawes Are most infring'd. Oh! how you, ride and run And plot, when Informations are begun Against a Member! Be it right, or wrong, How you consult together! how, you throng, To that Committee, whither they are brought! How speedily exceptions, forth are sought Against th'informers? what severity Are they examin'd with? how partially Are proofes considered? how slur'd and sleighted! How, are the persons wronged and despighted? How, inhumanly, are they, oft reviled? How, of their Liberties are they dispoiled? How are they scandall'd by false imputations, Of base Conspiracies, and subornations? How frequently are spread, to their disgrace (By men of seeming gravity, and place) Injurious rumors? which ev'n they who speak them, Know to be false; because, they first did make them? Thus you have used us; and, drawn in some Your partners, in injustice, to become, Because they thought you good, and, us as bad As by your fly deportments, we were made: And, by these practises, with many moe, (VVhich, we by dear experience, come to know) You have almost improved them so far, That, men may be as wicked as you are VVithout reproofe: Because, but few or none Dare, now, to speake, of what you have misdone. These things, with wrath, and scorn, the people heed; And, how in other matters you proceed, To that High-Courts dishonour, which, in show, You seem to serve, but, seek to overthrow. They notice take, with whom you do comply; VVhat Stars and Compasse you have steared by; For whom, you oftnest at Committees are; Against what Persons, you do most appear; VVhat great Rewards, and Titles you propose To pay a debt, which King nor Kingdome owes; How, you accompt; and, what Accompts you take VVhom you displace; whom Officers you make; On whom the richest places you confer; How, to your selves, Delinquents you endeare; And, how you vexe them, with affronts and braves, Who, have preserved you from being slaves. The People, your indulgence, likewise, marks To your dependents, and malignant Clarks; To what a height of pride, and wealth they clime By serving the corruptions, of the time; To what a vastnesse their estates are growne, By that, which hath the publike, overthrowne; What Priviledges, are by some, enjoy'd, Whilst they who suffred for them, are destroyd; Whilst they are sleighted, and without regard, Whose better service, merits best reward; Whose Bountie, hath enabled you to give; Whose valour, was the means, by which you live; And, by whose perseverance, you possesse The hopes of all your earthly happinesse. For, 'tis by them, whose blood you cast away That, you have bread and rayment, at this day; And, that within your Parlers, you may sit Of all your braveries, unplunder'd, yet, Whilest your Deliverers are like to sterve, Through want of what you wast, and they deserve. It is from you, whence all these mischiefes come, Which, to this Nation, are so troublesome. The Priviledges upon you bestowne For publike ends, are used for your owne. The Duties, which have been injoyn'd unto us, Are made, by you, but engines to undo us, Or, to betray us, to the spight of those, Whom, for the publike safety, we oppose. The Power, which we to save our Freedomes, gave, You have imployed, Freemen to inslave; And, would, should others act as you have done, Set many Tyrants up, instead of one. But, You, and Hee, whose wilfull ignorance, Of our just Rights, hath made him follow France In his Designes; and, hope in imitation, Of that French-Tyrant, who inslav'd his Nation, To bring our English-necks to that base Yoke; Ev'n You and Hee, shall know you much mistooke; And, that, if too sharpe curbs, our courses check, We, shall go neer to break the Riders neck. Our Nation much can bear; and, now and than Brook somewhat more, then at all times it can; But, tread not on us: For, you will not find, In English-Yeomen, your French-Peasants mind. Our Citizens, have served to be free; So born our Nobles, and our Gentry be: And, though French-Spaniels fawne, when they are beat Our true-bred English-Mastives, scorne it, yet. We hated Tyrannie, though in the King; And, will not brook, in you, the selfe-same thing Presume; not, therefore, to provoke too far, Abused patience, lest, deceiv'd you are. By Iustice, and by Kindnesse, you may take us; But, e'er by force, you bend us, you will break us. To keep us Freemen, we have you elected; Our rights we claime; and, more is not expected Nay, so far are we from desiring more, That, we, will, freely, back again restore What e're you give us, if it shall be known You give us any more then is our own. It is not our desire, that, for our sake, You, ought that is the Kings, from him should take Or any Trust of our, but, what abused By him hath been; or, what may be misused, Both to his harme and our: nor are we bent Either to keep, or change the Government, But, as God pleaseth, and shall move the Nations To do, hereafter upon just occasions; And, as it seemes expedient: For, we see Things-lawfull, inexpedient, sometime, be; Especially, when we shall snatch at them, Before they either have stood out their time, Or, we are fitted for them: This, rash course, Instead of mending; maketh matters worse: And, therefore, till, God, plainer shall disclose Those purposes of his, which no man knowes; We seriously, endeavour, and desire, Our King, unto his people, should retire; And, by Repenting, burnish up that Crowne, Which, for our sinnes and his is rustie grown. For, though our Cause be better; yet, since we Are in our selves, as blameable as he; And, unto God-ward, in Offences even; We could as well forgive, as be forgiven. But, in this point, your hearts are not upright Yea, and among your selves, you differ quite; For, some of you, mistaking the intent, And, loyall purpose of the Parliament, (Who leaves no means untride, whereby, it may Reduce the King unto the regall-way,) Have, out of Policy and (and, hope of that Which we were ever, far from ayming at) Appear'd desirous to contrive it so, That, he, and we might more asunder go, Untill our differences might increase Into impossibilities of Peace. Some other of you, to the King adhere, Not out of loyalty, but, out of fear, To whether side, you may most safely go, To save your selves; still, staggring, to and fro, Inconstantly, from th'one, to th'other side, According to the Current of the Tide; Not caring, whether Partie thriveth best, But, as it may advance your interest. And, this, hath made you otherwhile, assay How, you might either Him, or Vs betray. Whereas, if you were faithfull to that end, Which, outwardly, to favour you pretend; And, in the means, with patience, would await Gods leisure, without wav'ring, or deceit; (Endeavouring, as we have truly done, That, Hee, and We might meet againe in one) God, who, at pleasure, turnes the hearts of Kings, And, light, out of the greatest darknesse, brings; Might make this Breach, a means, perhaps, become, To knit a True-Love-knot through Christendome; Occasion give, to make this King endeavour To banish Tyrannie, from hence, for ever; And, be the first of Kings, who, truly, shall Lay down his Crowne, his Dignitie, and all At Christ his feet; and, take them up again, To act his will; and by his Law to raigne. For, though the Kings late failings do exceed, And, though God, peradventure, hath decreed, To cast both him and His, down from the Throne, Or, do to him, as justly he hath done To many Kings and Tyrants; yet, this Nation Hath hitherto, receiv'd no Revelation Of such a purpose; nor command, that they Should cast him, of their own accord, away. And, therefore, very wisely doth our State Gods own proceedings seek to imitate, In prosecuting him, and his offences, As, God doth us, in our impenitences: That, if the King, still frowardly go on, He, by own Designes, may be undone, And, God himselfe remove him: So, shall we Of our own suffrings, no avengers be, Ought further, then good conscience, and our lawes, May justifie our progresse in the Cause. For, by this patient waiting on his will, VVhether God bring him back, or let him, still Proceed and fall; yea, whether unto him, Or unto none, he give that Diadem VVhich he abus'd: God, shall so bring to passe VVhat, for his glory, pre-ordained was; That, it shall likewise, to our VVeal, redound, And, we with David, shall be blamelesse found Of hastning our deliverance, e're the day, According to our own devised way, As some have done; and, thereby mixt the Blessing VVith many bitternesses, in possessing. This patience, and this prudence would bring on That work, which is desired should be done. And, here should be that look't-for Kingdome then, VVhich will advance, all good and honest men. A Kingdome, wherein, they who are unjust; VVhere Parasites; were they who faile their trust, And men of wicked hearts, and shamelesse faces, Shall have nor credit, Offices, nor Places. This, this is that, ye Rebels which ye fear; This, makes you so enraged as you are: This, makes you, in vain projects to persist, And, drive a Factorage for Antichrist; VVhilst you are persevering, to fulfill The fleshly longings, of your private will. But, know, that, on your paths God hath an eye; An open-eare, to ev'ry poore mans cry: An able-hand, a stretcht-out-arme, to fetch Your Policie and Power within his reach: And, that though for a season you may thrive, In acting what you wickedly contrive; Yet, e're it shall befall as you fore-think, The Floods shall rise, and make the Mountaines sink. Then, turn back to your Vowes, e're 'tis too late; By Justice, help repaire this ruin'd state; Unite your selves, unfainedly, to those, VVhom, seeming to assist, you, still, oppose. Be warn'd oh Judges: and oh King be wise, And, sweeten so your daily sacrifice, VVith Justice, and with Mercy, that, God may From these three Kingdomes, turne his wrath away: That all the long-long sufferings he hath daign'd; That all the victories we have obtain'd; That all the counsels, vows, cries, prayers, and tears, Of trusty Commoners, and faithfull Peers, And all that wealth, and blood, this cause hath cost, May not, through want of unity, be lost. Make not this Parliament, without effect, By which, our greatest good we did expect. Permit not that, which our chief praise hath had, A scorn, by your corruptions, to be made. Sad not their hearts, who in their trust are true; VVho had ere this, prevailed, but for you; VVho, undeservedly, share, now, among them, The blame, wherewith, your guiltines doth wrong them, And, wil do so, til Justice, forth shal thrust, The wicked, from th'Assemblies of the just. Make not more Breaches: For, alas! there are, More then enough, already, ev'ry where: And, yet perhaps, no more then shall promote GOD'S glory; who, can presse an Antidote, Out of those poisonous fruits, and banefull things, VVhich forth from our corrupted nature springs; And, teacheth us oft times, ev'n by offences, The knowledge of approved Excellencies. That Independent-Presbyterian-Ginn, Which of Divisions hath occasion been, Shall never move to propagate that end, VVhich many fear, and many do intend: For, by his providence, and grace preventing, GOD, shall at last, extract from our dissenting, A wholsomer production, to these Nations, Then, yet, arides the vulgar expectations: Unlesse; a crying Epidemick-sin, To mar the blessing, cast some poyson in. Good-men, to both opinions do belong; Truth, is in both, with error mixt among; The face of both opinions, you put on, Or off, as your designs are to be done. Somtime, an Independent-Garbe you chuse; Somtime, you Presbyterian-vizards use, Untrue to both: and, when they see your scope, They, will become as uselesse, to your hope, Whom you deceive; as, to their hopes you are, Of whose opinions, you, a while appeare. We, who the WELL-AFFECTED, termed be, Are they, who in the Common-Cause agree, Although our judgemens varie; we, are loath To quarrell, to the ruining of both Opinions; or, the ruining of all, For differing, but in points dogmaticall: Lest, whilst for chaffe, and straw, we make a Fray, Our neighbours come, and steale the corn away. Some of us like one Party; some, the other; Some of us, are not much in love with either; Nor so displeas'd with either, as to joy In ought, which their due comfort may destroy. For, Patriots with both of them are found; Both, build their faith, and hope, upon one ground And, we believe, that, when GOD, from our eyes Hath scrap'd the scales, purg'd out our maladies (And, brought us by his grace, to treat together VVithout prejudicating one another) VVe, then, who, (being somwhat out of tune) Do, for the present, harsh divisions runne; Shall, when our notes, are tim'd, and rightly plac'd Joyne in a Diapason, at the last: Which, to our great contentment, will disclose That Perfect-Musicke from some discords flowes VVe, therfore hope, (though yet your fraud prolongs Our jealousies, &amp; multiplieth wrongs) That, all your Engineers, and cunning plots Shall nor divide the English, from the Scots; Nor separate those English from each other, VVho by their Covenant are knit together; Till they have done their work, and you are pai'd VVhat they deserve, who have their trust betrai'd Or, else, till they or we commit that act VVhich totally disso veth our contract: And, woe to them, who, shall unjustly take, Or, give the cause, that cursed Breach to make. But, whatsoever Blessing my ensue, No portion of it, can belong to you, In this estate: For, plainly, we descry, That, in the gall of bitternesse you lye; VVe see, although we cannot hinder it, VVhat you pursue, whilst in the House, you sit, VVhat things abroad, you practise, and allow; VVhat, you in secret, favour and avow; And, to effect, your purposes to bring, How, you abuse both Parliament, and King. We know the means, by which you entred in Upon what Principles, you did begin: What course you took, before you were elected What fame you had; of what you were suspected In what base projects, you a hand have had; How poor some of you were; how rich, now mad By publike ruins; and, what follow must If you be long continued in your Trust. We have observ'd, though many crooks it hath The turnings, and the windings of your path: How you divide the Clergie, by your sidings; How your divisions, and your sub-dividings, You multiply, and manie waies foment To work destruction to the Government In Church &amp; Common-wealth; and, how, your tricks (Extracted from the Jesuits politicks) Do shake the Fundamentalls, whereon stand The safety, wealth, and honour of the Land. We see, although we cannot, yet prevent Or, well expresse the same, how you have spent The Publike-Treasures; how the Publike Pow'r Is brought, it self to weaken, and devour: How, you oppresse the Countrey without pity; How, you abuse the Bounty of the City; Her valiant sons, how you have wrong'd and sleighted; Their faithfull service how you have requited; And, what, unlesse both you and we amend, Will be our portion, and your later end. Yea, we grow sensible, with what delay, Our suits are trifled off, from day to day: How long we wait, to have Petitions heard; And, when committed, how you dis-regard Our charge, by keeping witnesses in town; Our tedious pains in trotting up and down, To wooe for meetings; that our time and cost, In seeing Clerks, and Councell, be not lost: All these, with other hind'rances, unnam'd, (For which, the Houses are not to be blam'd) We suffer, to our bitter discontent, And, to the scandall of the Parliament Through your defaults; who, have, by sitting long, Learn'd new contrivances, for doing wrong; And, such obstructive, and destructive waies, As were to us unknown in former daies. GOD, be your speed, as your designes are just: Els, let them thrive, as we believe they must. Our hope, you were; but now, our Fear, you be: And, kept, by you, as lambs by wolves, are we. Regardlesse, of our wellfare, you are grown; Gods cause pretending, you pursue your own; Increasing, by the Common-wealths decrease; Improoving, by the ruin of our Peace; And, making to your selves, ev'n as you list, A Priesthood, Lawes, a Gospell, and a Christ. We that have been your first, and fastest friends, (If, ever, you had honourable ends In order to the publike) have, of late, But serv'd your turns, in serving of the State. This, having, for our forwardnesse enjoy'd, That, we are most opprest, and first destroy'd: And, through your fault, are griev'd by their neglect, Whom we most honour, and do best affect. Nay, which is worse, you who on us have brought This mischief, must, the Publike-friends, be thought, And we Delinquents; for no other cause, But seeking execution of the Lawes; Or, for endeavouring how to break ope Some necessarie passage, to our hope, VVhen we are almost stifled in the throng Of miseries, which have opprest us long. If, as our VOW injoyns us, we accuse Your Fellowes, who, have seemed to abuse Their Publike-Trust; Though, by our Information, VVe, only, seek the Kingdoms Reformation; Yet, such is your injustice, that, instead Of suffering us to have a faire proceed, (According to the merit of the Cause, The Subjects Priviledges, and the Lawes) You fall on us, as if that we were they VVho were accus'd, the Kingdom to betray: At leastwise, we are us'd, and look'd upon, As if some great offences we had done. The men inform'd against, you do permit In their own cause, Examiners to sit; To hear debates; our witnesses to see, And speak with them, ere they examin'd be; To act as Judge and Party; To enlarge, The guilty; to condemn, without a charge, Us, that are innocent; and to pursue us, As, if unquestionable Rogues, they knew us. And, if you were not, yet, more impudent, It might be borne: But, to the Parliament, You seek to make us odious; and to leave us Nor friend, nor bread, nor ought that ease may give us. And, which is worse then this, by having thus Thus impudently, made a scorn of us; (Whose good affections gen'rally are knowne) The people so discouraged are growne, That, had not some, a love unto the State, Which will out-live your tyranny, and hate; The Parliament, would be deserted so, And their Just-Quarrell so defamed grow, That Traytors would be traitors without feare; And, none be bold to say, they Traytors are. A multitude of other wayes you grieve us, Through misinforming them, who should relieve us, Through mis-reports, and making outward showes, Of better fruit, then on your dunghill growes: And, we have little hope of gaining ease, Till GOD himself, by miracle shall please, (Or, by some extraordinary way) To change your minds, or root you quite away: For, our most just-complaints, do nought asswage, Your cruelty, but, more encrease your rage. Our Patience, no repect at all hath won us, But, rather, makes you more insult upon us; Yea, and the more, your wills we stoop unto, The more we have to suffer, and, to do. If we seeme forward for the Common-weal, With popularity, you brand our zeal. If we contribute more then some of you, With enviousnesse, our bounty you pursue. And, whereas, we should favour'd be, therefore, You do not only make our burthens more Then other mens, when ablenesse have we, But, lay them on, when we unable be; And, for our being first in contribution, Intend to make us last in restitution. Nay, some of us, have cause to be affraid, Well-doing, shall with evill be repay'd: For, we, whilst you proceed; as yet you do, Have more then symptoms that it will be so. If want, compell us for our own to pray, With empty hands you send us, oft away; With long delayes, our patiences are tri'd, Ere we can get our suits heard or deni'd; And, then, lest too much grace, you should afford, You seldome, give us one respective word; But, looke upon us, with such pride, and scorn, As if to be your vassalls, we were born. Meanwhile your Favourites, forsooth, and they That, humour you in your imperious way, Are, for small merits, largely gratifi'd: (Or, such as nearly are to you alli'd) Their suits (if they petition) are preferr'd: If they complain, ere long, they may be heard: And, (though it were by chance) if well they do, They get for trifles, thanks, and money too. If nearer pinch'd, our suits, we do renew; And, being sleighted, some distemper shew, Your zeale, one hasty word, of ours, more heeds, Then all our good, and well-deserving deeds; And, well we scape, if to an empty purse, You adde not somwhat else, that shall be worse. Thus, we with our poor children, and our wives Are forc'd to live uncomfortable lives; Whilst you, and they, whom open foes, we call, Piece up, your tatter'd fortunes, by our fall. For, of one Moity, they have us bereft; And, you, have robbed us, of what they left. By our opposing them, we shall be sure, Of their despight, ev'n whilst our lives endure: By persevering, to our Country, true, We are in danger of the like from you; And so, which side soever shall prevaile, We have a mischief on us, by intaile To us, and to our heirs. For, you in heart United are; though, corp'rally, apart; And, joyn, by close compliances, in one, In hope to finish, what you have begun; Which is nor worse, nor better; but, to raise Your houses, both by good, and evill wayes; And, for this end, to ruine, you would bring Law, Gospell People, Parliament and King; But, ere your hopes effected you shall see, Hark Traiters, what your destinie shall be. Hark, and observe it: For, it is the doome, That, shall, without all peradventure, come Upon their heads, who have their trust betray'd Oppressions on their faithfull servants laid; Or, multipli'd their wealth, with greedinesse, By preying on their Countrey, in distresse. And, it is this; He that such wrongs requites, Shall give you portions with damn'd hypocrites: Your pride, by shame, shall suddenly be follow'd; You shall spew up the gobbets, you have swallow'd Your way shall perish: you, shall quite be thrust Forth, from that Congregation of the Just, VVhich you pollute: GOD, in your steads will place Men, rich in wisdom, honesty, and grace: Such, as are truly called, duly sent: Such, as befit an English-Parliament: And, able, then, that Senate shall become, To curb their Foes abroad; and, Knaves, at home So, having utter'd what we had to say; Now, you among the Faithfull-members may Go shrowd your selves again: For, pleas'd are we You should be thought, as honest, as they be, If, you will yet, repent; and, justly, do The Publike-worke, which you are call'd unto. We, likewise, could be very well content, That, none shoud say, or think, these lines were meant Of any one, within the Senate-doore, If, cause there were, of no such thought before, As we do intimate: For, we are come Not with a sword, but, OPOBALSAMUM To cure your Vlcers, and to make you clear From all those Blots, which, now, on you, appear. VVe, no man, individually, disclose, But, speake, what almost ev'ry Reader knowes; And, whereof each man tattles to his friend, (It may be) to a lesse commodious end. VVe speak in Generalls, that, men to blame Might be reprooved, without open shame; And, by themselves, in private, take occasion To seek their safety, with our preservation; And, these things, to their own amendment marke, Before those Mastives bite, which, yet, but bark. We charg you, here, with nought, but what we know, And, what is known to many thousand moe: Nay, here is nothing mention'd, but what you And, your own Consciences, do know is true. VVe were advis'd hereof, before we spake it; VVe are not ignorant, how some will take it; Nor, with what secret malice, and despight, They will pursue it, to their utmost might: For, some of us, already, though unheard, Are censured; nay, many have not spar'd, Of one yet living, publikely, to say He executed was; and, nam'd the day. Yet, we resolved were, Elihu-like, Without respect of Persons, truth to speak. If you desirous be, that none should lay These matters to your charge; your surest way, Is not, to rage; or, furiously to turne Upon the Writer; or, the Booke to burne: But, rather, to repent; and make a show That, of these free reproofes you do allow; And, of our setting thus before your eyes, A perfect draught of your deformities. Yet, best of all your shame would be prevented, If, order you procure, to have it printed, And, some Reward, bestowed upon those, Who have character'd thus, their Countries Foes: For, none can think, that they, who guilty be, To such a motion, ever would agree; Or, that, a prudent-honest man will frown, To see the wickednesse of Knaves made known. However it succeeds; we say, and swear, We neither for your frownes, or favours care: Which protestation, if you think untrue; Make tyrall; do your worst, and so adieu. Thus, ended they their Speech; But, e're 'twas done, A sullen murmuring, began to run Throughout the guiltie-party; yea, they all With anger looked either red, or pale. Some snuft, some puft, some grin'd; the mouth some wride; Some bit their lips, some hung their heads aside. Some, jeerd, some fleerd, some rag'd; and they who had Least honesty and wit, appear'd most mad. Some, ran into the Hall, in discontent, To see, if they had put their Speech in Print: Some, home; some, to the Taverne walked back, (From whence they came) and drunke a quart of Sack. Some, swore; and cursed all the Well-affected: Some threatned him whom justly they suspected To be the Penner of it, and they swore If they could helpe it, he should write no more. Some, did advise to apprehend, and call him, To some Committee, and, there soundly maul him, That, others may take warning, how they dare Speake truth to them, who love no truth to heare. But, others minding what a Vote had past, On that Committee, which abus'd him last, And, being fearfull, that his good intent, Would e're long time, unto the Parliament, So evident be made, that their despight Would rather on their heads then his alight; They waved that, and, being at a stand, In thinking, what they best might take in hand, At length; Come let us smite him with the tongue, Said one of them, who knew what doth belong To deep revenge; and let us daily strow, Some scandals of him, wheresoe're we go. Another of them, wiser then the rest, (In earnest, partly, partly too, in jest) Perswaded much, to let him quite alone, And mend, what they themselves amisse had done. A few, approv'd the Motion; but, not all: VVe therefore, know not, yet, what will befall. But, you shall heare, within a day or two, (If you have patience) what they meane to doe. Here, thought I, to conclude, conclude; but, hear, ye, now, Before we part, a word or two, to you, Ye Worthies of both Houses; and, all ye VVho, VVell-affected to this Kingdome be. Now, heare Him, for himselfe, who, hath not spared; To speake for your availe; nor been out dared By any danger, to declare his mind, According as our Cov'nant hath enjoynd. He is not ignorant, how great a Stake, He hath among you: Nor, how, course to take To thrive, as others doe. But, he disdaines, For any hope on earth, to take the paines; To vary from his heart, in Word, or Action, To humour any man, or any Faction. Be pleased to consider, that, all this Was penned, for no private end of his; Nor can procure him ought, save their despight, Who, in the wrong of harmlesse-men delight; Unlesse, you faithfully to him adhere, As by our solemn-Vow, engag'd you are; Which, doth obliege, that, firme you stand to those, VVho doe their best, Delinquents to disclose; And, likely meanes, and lawfull wayes invent To bring them to deserved punishment. Thus, I, (as heartily, as any One) According to my Faculties, have done; And shewne these Times, and, those, perhaps, to come, That, Poesie, may have an usefull Roome, In great Affaires; and Poets, fill their place, VVhether, the times, be generous or base. Though I no Patron find, assur'd I am, This VVork, would not have done the Author shame, In better times: Nay, if an Irish-Bard Had sung thus much, to them, they would have heard His Numbers with respect: and many things Bestow'd; beside a Harp with silver strings. But, I shall think my game hath well been playd, If I, with mischiefe, shall not be repayd For my Good-will; nor, left, when I have done, To bear the burthen of dispights, alone. For your own sakes, take heed, I humbly pray, It be not so; lest, you repent it may, VVhen you, by One, and One, opprest shall be, And, then, forsooke; as, you deserted me. I am not, for my selfe, of ought afraid, VVhich can to me, be either done, or said: For, what my Foes can take, I, well can spare; And, nothing have to lose, for which, I care. Ther's VVealth in want, ther's Honour, in Disgrace, And, Life in Death, for him, that's in my case. I ask of you nor Riches nor Reward; (Though, those things, I, sometime, too much regard Let where you please, your Bounty be bestown; So I may have, what, justly, is mine own; That, will suffice, to set me fully free, From all Engagements, now, oppressing me; And, leave to those, for whom, I should provide, Enough, to keep them, both from want, and Pride I ask no Honours: For, no hope I have Of honour, here, till I am in my grave: And, if to me, some share be, then, allow'd, It will be best; for, 'twill not make me proud; Nor in my life time, those Corruptions nourish, VVhich, make of men in honour, Beasts that perish I ask not for my selfe, the smallest thing, VVhich, meerly, to my-selfe, may profit bring; But, all I shall desire, is, these two Boones, (Which, I conceive, are just, and equall ones) First, this; that, I, whose credit, now, appears To have continu'd seven and fifty yeares, Without reproach (except it be among That crew, who cannot slander with their tongue May not, with you, a Good-opinion lose, Though that Report, which, my malicious-Foes Have latelie made to my disreputation; (By laying to my charge a Subornation) Till, fully, and impartiallie, you heare How, I shall make their impudence appeare, Who have traduc'd me; &amp; what streights the pass (What open injuries, and what disgrace) Who, in a conscionable path, shall go; And, to the Publike, would their duties do, As I have done: They judge, as cause appears And, let him perish, that, Right-Judgement, fears This, not for mine own honour do I crave; But, that, your honour, may no blemish have; And, that, by taking my repute away, The Divill, (who such plots doth often lay) Disparage not the Truths, that I have told, To make them ineffectuall, if he could. To this end, only, I your Justice crave, That, now, (with yours) my honour I may save And, to no other end: For, 'tis to me, Honour enough, an Innocent, to be. And, yet, who knowes, but, GOD, may look upon The wrongs, which have to me of late beene done Who knowes, but that ere long, receive he may The Ports of Haman, and of Mordecai? Or, make, what seems my shame, to be my glory When future Ages, read this Ages story? My next (oh! Noble Friends) and last request Is this; that, if I should be so opprest As is intended, you, would think upon Those, whom, by serving you, I have undone; That, Halfe of Me (who, had a share, in that, VVhich I adventur'd freely, for the State) And, those, Branch'd from us, who thereby are left, No meanes of Bread, or Breeding; but, bereft Of all their outward-helpes: Oh! let them find More grace, then yet I do: yea, be so kind, That, unto them, may truly payed be, What, on the Publike-Faith, you owe to me, In Debts, on faire account, due from this Nation By private, and by publike Obligation. My Naturall-Affection, makes me fear This Motion needfull. Therefore, have a care You sleight it not; For, doubtlesse, if you do, God will require it; and, requite it, too Yea, if you shall forget what I prefer, God, will remember, your Remembrancer; And, when your Children shall with hunger pine, Provide abundance of good-things for mine. Thus hopes, and thus believes, Geo: Wither. Fiat Voluntas Dei. THREE GRAINS of Spirituall Frankincense, Infused into Three Hymnes of Praise; and Humbly offered toward the publike Thanksgiving, commanded by Authority of Parliament to be celebrated throughout the Commonwealth of England, the 30. of this present January, 1650. To the Right Honourable John Bradshavv Esqu. LORD PRESIDENT OF THE Councell of STATE. [If Scorners term these Ballads, 'twill not much] If Scorners term these Ballads, 'twill not much Regarded be, though there be many such: For, they, perhaps, are Fools, or Children, yet; And may be wiser, when they shall have wit. If any thinks these Odes are over long, Let him not do his credit so much wrong, To say it, till he sees what may be spar'd; And, passe thereon his judgment, afterward. There can arise no great discommendation, By lengthening out a pious Recreation: Nor merit they much heed, that can be weary To sing of Dangers past, and to be merry. Hymne. 1. [With aweful Joy, and joyful Fear] This first Hymne (prepared for the publike Thanksgiving, injoyned on the thirtieth of Jan. 1650.) may, most properly, be sung at the beginning of Divine Exercises, publike or private, the same day. Sing this as the 100. Psalm. 1 With aweful Joy, and joyful Fear, To sanctifie, O Lord, this day, Before thy Foot stool we appear; And, our Thank-offrings here to pay: Which though it be no other thing, Then thy Free-mercies to confesse; Or, Songs, unto thy praise to sing; Vouchsafe acceptance, nay-the-lesse. 2 Within our selves, we are so poor, That, we have nothing of our own, But, what we had from thee, before; Which, by our sins impair'd is grown: For, our wit, beauty, strength, and health, (The goods of body, and of mind) Our time, our honours, and our wealth, To serve our lusts, have been resign'd. 3 And, therefore, till thou shalt renew Thine Image, by our fault defac'd, We, and our Offrings, from thy view, Deservedly, may forth be cast. There is no musick in our Songs, That's worthy to be heard of thee; Because, our hearts, eyes, ears, and tongues, Prophaned, and untuned be. 4 Yet, by those favours, heartned on, Which were on us bestown, of late, A Hymn, we joyntly have begun, To sing this Day, at Mercies gate. Lord! those eternall doores unclose, Through which thy speciall graces flow; The cords of our Corruption lose, And, let thy Spirit on us blow. 5 Then, ev'ry word, we hear, or say, With ev'ry thing, that's done, or thought (In celebrating of this Day) Shall do thee honour, as it ought: And, they that study publike harms, Or, flout, what we are doing here, Shall be so bound up, by these Charms, That when they flout us, they shall fear. Hymne 2. [Oh God! how good! how kind art thou!] This other Hymne (composed for the same Day) may be sung before the Sermon (or, between the Sermons, where two are preached) or, before the second Chapter; or, after any pause (or change of Exercises) in Devotion. Sing this as the 113. Psalm. 1 Oh God! how good! how kind art thou! What help, what grace, dost thou bestow On us, in our distrest estate! Our tears to triumphs, thou hast turn'd, We now do sing, who lately mourn'd, And, by our Foes, were jeered at. When we were weak, poor and forlorn, Expos'd to dangers, fears and scorn, Our Comforter, thou didst become: And, when we dreaded shame of face; Spoils, death, or wounds, joyn'd with disgrace; Those fears, we were deliver'd from. 2 As thou, from base and servile bands, And out of cruel Pharoahs hands, Thine Heritage redeemd'st of old: Ev'n so, from those, who sought our harm, Thou broughtst us off, with out-stretch'd arm, With signs and wonders manifold. They so, were blinded, Lord, by thee, Who, might have seen, but vvould not see; Nor hear when they were counsell'd well: And He that fraud, and force imploy'd, To make our Lavvs, and Freedomes void; In our own view, like Pharoah, fell. 3 This is the Day, whereon our Yoke Of Norman Bondage, first was broke; And, England from her chains made free. This is the Day, vvhereon the Lord, Did manumit us by the sword, And, 'tis novv signall, by decree. Slaves, they deserve to be, therefore, And to be bar'd for evermore, The Freedoms of this Commonweal, Who shall not thankfull, now appear, And vindicate with sword and spear, Gods just Replies, to our Appeal. 4 By thee, our Freedoms, Lord, vve got; Oh! to our keeping, leave them not: But, still their Guardianship retain, And, let not those, vvho under thee, Sub-keepers, of those Freedoms be, Nor, our sins, forfeit them, again: On those alone, that are unjust Or shall be traytrous to their trust, To this Republike, or to Thee, Let thy avenging justice fall; And, on all those who hinder shall, That Peace, with Truth, may setled be: 5 Write in our hearts, thy sacred Law; And, let no future failings, draw Our former cursed bondage back: But, our depraved wills renew, And, to thy service, keep us true: Which, wil our Freedoms perfect make. The Kingdom, Power, and Praise be thine, As long as Moon, and Sun shall shine: Be, likewise, thou our Heritage: And, in this Nation, let there be No other King, or GOD, but thee, What e're they are, who thereat rage. Hymne 3. [All you, that present are] This third Hymne, may most properly be sung the same day, after the conclusion of the last Sermon; or, at the consummation of any other Devotion. Sing this as the 148. Psalm, doubling the last strain of the Tune. 1 All you, that present are, Come, let our hearts, and tongues, The Praise of God declare, In new Thanksgiving songs; Come, let us sing Strains, that may make, the walls to shake, The Roofs to ring: Still sounding higher, Till thereby, we, with Angells, be Join'd in one Quire. 2 Related, we have heard, What he, for us, hath done; With how much disregard, Our Foes, he looks upon: And, we have seen, How, he befriends, when righteous ends Pursu'd have been VVe, likewise vievv VVhat will befall, to those that shall Their lust pursue. 3 We see, or may behold, That, he our Armies leads; And (as in times of old) His Banner o're them spreads, And for our sakes, Through threats and spights, through depths and heights, Their passage makes, VVhilst, to his praise Their Foes to nought, are justly brought, In plainer waies. 4 He, made both Seas and Wind, To them assistance lend; And, what they had design'd, Sun, Moon, and Clouds befriend. Force, he repells; He makes them bold, to march where cold, And hunger dwells; And, when their fear Did most abound, they mercy found, And Victors were. 5 To him doth Praise belong; For, he did them subdue, Who num'rous were, and strong When we were weak, and few; And when our Foes Came bragging on, and thought all won, They all did lose. Still, be it thus; Lord! alway, so, them overthrow VVho malice us. 6 His wise-foresight prevents, The Politicians wiles: He, crosses their intents, He, at their Projects smiles: In his due time. He still unknots, all hidden plots, Contrived by them: And, in that snare, VVhich, for our feet, they closely set, Still caught they are. 7 Vain sons of men, therefore, Your bruitish grumbling cease; Pursue false-hopes no more, But follow after peace. More prudent grow; Reform your waies, and sing his Praise As now we do: Oh! whilst you may In God rejoyce, and hear his Voice VVhile 'tis to day. 8 Let all men do the same, Of whatsoe're degree; And magnifie his Name, As all obliged be. His Righteousnesse, His Power and Grace, in ev'ry place Let all confesse: And lay aside Their own deserts, their selfish hearts, Their stinking pride. 9 Your strength to him submit, You, that have conquests won: Wise men ascribe your wit, To him, ev'n him alone, For, he supplies The Fool with skill, and, when he will Befools the wise. And, certainly, Unto to your Foes, he, gives the blows By which they die. 10 Rich men, your precious things Bring forth, your Thanks to show; Before him, (Oh ye Kings) Your Heads, and Scepters bow; And, as 'tis meet, Come from your Thrones, and cast your Crowns Beneath his feet: For, Kingdomes all To him pertain, and he again Resume them shall. 11 Oh! let all things that were, That are, or shall ensue; (Or, but in thought appear) Thy Praise, O God, forth-shew; Till Times last bound: And, let it run, when time is done, An endlesse Round: Where, needs not be Privations Night, that we true Light May better see. 12 Mean time, let not his praise Be meerly, in our Voice, As if vve thought to raise A Trophy, out of Noise: But, let us more Our Thanks expresse, in Righteousnesse, Then heretofore: Els (this is plain) False shows we make, and, do but take GODS Name in vain. FINIS. Furor-Poeticus (i.e.)Propheticus. G. W. Esq; A Poetick-Phrensie. Some, (probably) will call it so: Thus named, therefore, let it go. It is the result of a private-musing, occasioned by a publike report in the Country, of the Parliaments restauration by General GEORGE MONCKE, in February 1659. and meditated soon after the said General's arrival in LONDON, In dorso Pagi, recubans sub tegmine Fagi: This Author's well, and sober, yet, Although he fell into this Fit; But, if more Wit than Grace he had, Oppressions would have made him mad. Tempora mutantur, &amp; nos mutamur in illis. Times changed be, and so are we. To the Reader. That, which henceforth, the common Lot, will be In Weal, or Woe, shall be foreshown in me: For, whether to the right or left it run, Judgement shall at GOD's House be first begun. Furor-poeticus,(i.e.)Propheticus. A Poetick-Phrensie. A Fit, that some will call poetick-madness, Hath now surprized me, in sober-sadness; Which, how it seiz'd me, shall be here declar'd, If any think it worthy of regard: Nay, heard it shall be, since it is begot, Whether regarded, or regarded not: For, good to them, is equally intended, Who, shall be therewith, pleased or offended, If, quite insensible, they are not grown Both of the publike welfare, and their own; And, if well taken, this despised-bable, Will hint some Notions not unprofitable. From thence, where many did of wrongs complain, (And, where, to right them, some few strove in vain) I was retir'd, as far as I could go, From hearing, what Knaves, Fools, and mad men do; Expecting no such influence from heaven As now appears, till nights and daies were even: About which time (though why I do not know) I look'd for something, like what's happen'd now: But, Rumor, which is flutt'ring ev'ry whither, Hath of a quicker change brought tidings hither: Whereon, a greater change will soon ensue, If probable conjectures may be true. The Wind is strangely turn'd; but, none yet knows For whose avail, or to whose harm it blows: Because, to guess who is a foe or friend, Or, what, men by their words or deeds intend, 'Tis now so hard, that none can scape deceit Save he, who keepeth his own heart upright, And he (ev'n then) may suffer naytheless, Who walketh in the paths of righteousness. I hear the news; and I have heard it too, With as much joyful hope as most men do Who know the World, and how much doubt and fear May rise from ev'ry thing they see and hear; When there is little Justice, Truth, or Order, The preservation of their peace to further; And where they are so puzz'led in the dark, That they rejoyce in any glim'ring spark. A Star, is now shot hither from the North; But, what events the same will usher forth I cannot tell; nor (though the Morning's bright) What clouds may overshadow us ere night; And, therefore, I must wait a while, to heed With what Aspects those Planets will proceed Which regulate our Clime, before I can Conclude on anything design'd by man. The greatest Planet, that appears in heaven Hath no more influence than one in seven; And, from malevolence, we are not free While Mars and Saturne in conjunction be, Although to comfort us, we may receive Fair promisings, from all the other five; Except that he who plac'd them in their Orbs Their Constellations qualifies and curbs; And, they are lying Prophets, who shall dare In his name, any sequel to declare, As absolute, and not conditional, Relating meerly to to things temporal: For, that could only, but a means become, To make men desperate, or to presume. He, that, our grand Ænigma's must unriddle Is in the Zenith now, ev'n in the middle Of that place, where our fatall Gordian-knot, (If my conjectures greatly fail me not) Must be unti'd, or cut; and if so fast And so ensnarl'd it be, that, at the last The Sword must once again the same unknit, Woe be to them who shall occasion it. O'er LONDON, now that Luminary shines, Which, I foretold in my last publish'd lines, Should be the Mountain whence that winde would blow Which of our greatest weal, or greatest woe, Should instrumental be; and I expect Accordingly, ere long time, an effect. We oft see miracles (I must confess) But, I would fain see truth and righteousness Ascend the Throne; that, we at length might feast Upon that Peace, whereof we had a taste; And, on those mercies which in little time GOD would vouchsafe, if we reli'd on him, And wilfully pursu'd not still that course Which to destroy our hopes, may him enforce; And which, by long neglect of good endeavour, Are now in hazard to be lost for ever. He, many Patrons and Deliv'rers gave us, From Forraign and Domestick foes to save us: Of whom, some, by their self-will and Ambition, Wrought both our sorrow, and their own perdition. Some of them, we disabled; some despis'd: We flatter'd some, and some we Idoliz'd, Untill to such a height we puft them had, That to our servants, slaves our selves we made; Yet cease not at this hour to do the same, Though still, it brings more sorrow, and more shame; And will, to be deliver'd from one curse Thereby incurr'd, run headlong to a worse. Mark, (though you sleight me) what we dayly do; And brand me, if it shortly prove not so, Unless we tack and wheel about to that Which may prevent it, ere it be too late. GOD, still, in his long suffering doth persever, And, us, from our distractions to deliver Renews his mercy still, when we (almost) Our hopes of reparation have quite lost. Yea, though he finds us willing to return To our late Bondage; to distrust and scorn The Doom pronounced for this Common-weal When we did in the field to him appeal: Although he sees us prone in ev'ry triall To make of our just Cause a base deniall; To bid to his assistances defiance; With his, and our known foes to have compliance; From our professions to apostatize, And to requite him with hypocrisies For all his favours; he is still to us The same he was, though we continue thus; And, though he from our sins himself withdraws, Still owneth both our Principles and Cause. He hath now rais'd, beyond our expectation, A likely means of timely reparation, And, by his providence, a man begot To perfect it, if we corrupt him not, Nor he decline from what he hath profest In order to the publike Interest; Which I suspect not, if he be so strong As to resist the batt'ries of the Tongue, And use those Antidotes that may prevent The poys'ning that's infus'd by Complement. At this time, to be GOD's Probationer In his great Work, as others lately were, He takes his turn; and peradventure, may Attain a Pow'r as absolute as they; That, what by them was wilfully neglected, (And by a less Power cannot be effected) May now be done. LORD! make him wise and strong, To do what to his duty doth belong; And mindful, that, his chiefest Obligations Are, to be true to Thee, and to these Nations. St George for England, we were wont to say; And, to that Name, assign'd a solemn day We knew not why: But, if what's now begun Shall with sincerity be carried on, It did, perhaps, by way of Allegory, Presage what will produce an Actual Story; That shall in future times, deserve much better Mens credit morally, than in the Letter That Fable did: For, we may hope (unless Good probabilities have ill success) A Champion of this Name shall free us from That Dragon which infests all Christendome, And, set a Bar to their malignant-pow'r, Who threaten this Republike to devour. If so it happen, it will more endear This Name of George, than Dick, or Oliver; Yea, more than all their Names, who lately lost That honour, which they purchas'd at our cost, And left us in those hazards, from whence, none Now can deliver us, but, GOD alone By his own Arm, or else by an advance Of one design'd for our deliverance, And qualifi'd by his especial grace, To be a Guardian Angel for this place. Instead of that imaginary Saint, Which on our Inns, and Tavern-signs we paint, And, whom our Grandees, in blew Ribbands wore, As badge of their chief honour heretofore; (And in his room, of whom about next Spring, Another Party seem'd in hope to sing John for the King) GOD, hath perhaps, prepar'd That Hero for our Tutelary Guard; Whom Fame reports arriv'd with an intent To re-invest the baffl'd Parliament With her lost Pow'r: which, if it so ensue, Will make some bid their old St George adieu: His Legend, will be very little priz'd, Except, as now, it is Mythologiz'd: And, this GEORGE will henceforward, by this Nation Be thought more worthy of Canonization Than either He, or any one of those On whose new Saintships, we did trust repose, Till many did our confidence contemn, And few, at last, trust either us, or them. This GEORGE for England, probably intends The publike weal without sinister ends, And is One meaning that which he professes; One, whom nor gifts, nor flattering Addresses Shall tempt from an heroick Resolution, Or, draw to an ignoble prosecution; One, whom the Strumpet, who bewitcheth Kings, Nor those enchanting Songs the Syren sings, Shall so seduce, as they seduced were, Who, by the Dragons tail were from their Sphere Unhors'd of late: But, one who shall proceed, Till from his Fangs these Nations he hath freed, Despising those Allurements, whereby they Who would divert him, hope to stop his way: For, if his heart be right, he will suspect Those Baits laid to corrupt his Intellect, Or blind his eyes; that, from what's well begun Into their Pitfals he may stumble on. He will consider, that, they who profess Much love (and fawn with most obsequiousness) Are either some of those, or such as they Who did the same to them the other day, Whom now most barbarously they revile; And may abuse him worse within a while. And, he will see, that he must be more wary Than they were, who, not long since, did miscarry, By playing like a Moath about the flame, Till thereby quite consumed they became. I hope, that as I have exprest him here, He is resolv'd: If not, I wish he were; That I might live to see, before I die, One man, whose Deeds made not his words a lie. A Monk profest, an Instrument became Of Reformation: Why not one by Name? If love of honesty with him prevail, The hopes of honest men he will not fail: If love of honour, or of safety move him, Those Interests, will for our Cause improve him. It is a much more honourable thing, To save a People, than to make a King, And safer too; if he that makes him one Shall be his Liege-man whom he doth enthrone: For, Kings are of their Makers so afraid, That, seldome are such benefits repay'd With less than ruine; specially, if he A man beloved of the People be: But, much more hazardous will be his Case, If he be likewise of the Royal Race. This General, hath been a Royalist, Engag'd against the publike Interest, And, therefore, some suspitious are become He may, at last, his first Cause re-assume: But, that's improbable: For hitherto He nothing seemeth to neglect, or do, Save what he should; If there be neither ought Done or omitted, more than yet, is brought Unto my ears; and his professions are Sufficient to abate the Peoples fear; Yet, with that modesty consist, whose want Made others, lately so exorbitant, That, many did suspect their gaudy signe VVas hung forth but to vent unwholsome wine. He may appear to those who cannot see, Whereto he shall necessitated be To deviate sometimes; yet, naitheless No whit infringe essential righteousness; As when he is compell'd to raise a Blind To frustrate what is by his Foes design'd, And hoped for, by letting them enjoy Those hopes a while, which may themselves destroy; Or, that he may discov'ries make, thereby, Whom to suspect, and on whom to relie. That, he was once a Captain for the King, Doth him with me, in no suspition bring, If he retain but so much gen'rousness As honourable Sword-men do profess: For, there are many persons whom I know, True to him then, and faithful to us now: And touching him, this is considerable, That he made no revolt dishonourable To his Profession: nor his aide withdrew Fro him, to whom he thought his service due; Or left him till that Obligation ended By his decease, on whose life it depended: No, nor did afterward desert his Cause, Till having leisure to peruse the Laws And Customes of this Nation, he perceiv'd, Crowns were not alwaies by descent receiv'd; Nor justly could be worn by any here, Till by the People they elected were Upon conditions; whereto they were both By Law obliged, and engag'd by Oath: Which having weigh'd; and that by GOD's permission The Pow'r was in another mans possession Without dispute; meer conscienciousness (Not Levity) induc'd him to profess And Act, as he hath done. This, I take leave Till he shall contradict it, to conceive; And, of my hopes concerning him, expect To see ere long, a sutable effect; Whereof, if I unhappily shall miss, My damage will be ten times less than his; Since really, he thereby forfeits more His honour, than he did in shew before: And, if at this time, to his moral trust, And his Engagements he shall prove unjust, (Which may be possible) no further, then, Thenceforward, in the words or deeds of men Will I confide, beyond what I know true; Whether of honesty, they make a shew, Or of Religion: But conclude that we On whomsoere we trust, may cheated be; And think, (as I did heretofore suppose) None but false friends, and reconciled foes Should overthrow our Cause. My hopes of him Are better yet: (Oh GOD! continue them.) No cause to me appeareth of suspect, Save such as I may reasonably reject. Yet, since he's but a man; and lest I seem To under-prize, or over-value him; Yea, since the heart's unknown; and I now am Of him inform'd, but by a common fame, At such a distance too, as cannot give me Assurance that Report will not deceive me, I'll keep him on the Balance, till I hear How he proceedeth and shall persevere: For Lucifer did fall; yea, and he fell Whom some thought lately, more than parallel To Moses, Josuah, and many more, Renowned for their vertues heretofore: And, since he possibly, by Adulations, May be exposed to the like temptations; I will not, though he bravely hath begun, A Garland make him, till the field is won. But, if I live to hear he shall persever In prosecuting of his best endeavour To that effect for which GOD seems to raise him, Whatere event shall follow, I will praise him, In such a Mode, as cannot justly be By others blam'd, or shame to him or me; Which none can do, though his deserts were greater, Who doth not praise a man to make him better. Faithful performances have been so rare, That this Republike barb'rous would appear, If, what he merits be not duly weigh'd And well rewarded, when her debts are paid. Yet, lest he may be (if deferr'd till then) As ill repaid as other faithful men, Let them reward him now, (and whilst they may;) For, here will be new changes ev'ry day. But, though he do his duty; nor his Pow'r Or Virtue will avail us, till of our Known duties, our regard be somewhat more Than it appears to have been heretofore. No good success, though he continue true, If we be false, can possibly ensue. No Nation can from servitude be saved, Which, when it may be free, will be enslaved. They easily, and justly are betray'd, Where Traitors are for treason better paid Than faithful men, who freely did oppose, With life and livelihood, their Countries Foes. Who can be safe, where it is hardly known Either what Laws, or Cause, or Pow'r to own, Or to disown? VVhere, merited or not, Knaves, Fools, and Wise men have the self-same Lot? And honest men, deserving best, (and first) A worse than they, who have deserved worst? Yea, where some suffer, till they cannot fear VVorse mischiefs, than they feel already there, Although he should deceive their expectations, Who, now, preserves the peace of these three Nations, Expose us to the fury of the Dragon, And with his horse, draw hither Charles his Wagon. Some, are of this, in hope, and some afraid; But chiefly they who have been largely paid For little work; and some for doing none, Or, that, which had been better left undone. Some, who were paid with little, for great cost, Which then may be in hazard to be lost: Some likewise, whom their Conscience hath accus'd For having wilfully their pow'r abus'd. But, be it as GOD pleaseth it shall be, It no whit startles, or affrighteth me: For, though this George should act that which will further His ends, who is the Soveraign of the Order Of George on horseback, guiltless I have bin Of what may make me dread his coming in; Because, I acted nothing with intent To Innovate the former Government, Or to uphold this Pow'r, save that, whereto Conscience and Duty did oblige me to. For, when the late Intestine war begun, I did not by a self-inducement run To make a Breach; but, (called by that Power Which was by Law intrusted, both with our And his Prerogatives who then did raign) Came arm'd, aswell his Interest to maintain, As to preserve our own: Which may appear By that Impress my Cornet then did bear. Pro Rege, Lege, Grege, was the WORD Which manifested why I drew my Sword; And if the Pow'r I ought to have obey'd Misled me, let the fault on that be laid. What is't to me, since I am innocent, If they proceeded further than I went? The Pow'rs that rule, my lawful warrant be, And ought not to be questioned by me. If they had ill intents, in what was done, What blame have I deserved, who had none? Or, who can blame them justly, if perforce The Consequents have hapned to be worse Then their Design? as I believe (and shall Believe) it was, in some, though not in all. If for the sins of Nations and of Kings GOD casts out Governours, and Judgements brings Upon a People; What man can resist His hand, or mend the matter, till he list? Who doth not stand obliged to maintain The Pow'r that GOD sets up, whilst it must raign, Although it shall oppress him, and were sent To be, for his defaults, a punishment? And, who so little reason understands, That when without advancing of his hands He, by anothers act, (through GOD's permission, May of his long-lost Freedom gain fruition) Will not accept it, when it may be had, Although they who were fools, will be so mad To venture their own lives, those to betray That would not be as very slaves as they? When GOD enthrals a Nation, 'tis a crime To break their chains and cords before his time; And when he setteth ope the prison door, They do offend as much, or rather more, By adding to ungrateful disrespects Of GOD's free grace, unnatural neglects: If therefore, when our sins we had confest, GOD, them removes from us who then opprest; And when we slip into our former course, Brings back again those Tyrants, or else worse, Why should I murmur to behold him just? Or, (if I do repent, and in him trust) Fear, I shall him inexorable find, Whom I offend not, but against my mind? When frailty, and the torrents of the times, Have hurri'd me into the vulgar crimes? This I have well considered: And, though they Who, wilfully have gone out of the way, And, with corrupt minds, do again begin To tread the paths which they have erred in; (Not yet repenting) find, that evil-tidings (Because they have not settled their abidings Beneath the shade of GOD-Almighties wings) Are, in these times of trouble, dreadful things; He arms my heart against them; and the more They shake the Earth, and make the Waters roare, The more I slight them. Yea, although, beside Those dangers, which have others terrifi'd, My ruine threatning, there, at present stand Steep mountains, and a Desart on each hand; Deep seas before me, and an host behind Which doth appear malignantly enclin'd; Yet, all these cannot from my hopes remove me, Because, I see GOD in a cloud above me. My chief well-being, totally consists With that wind, which blows when, and where it lists, And, 'twill not mar my prime contentment, whether We shall have Parliaments, Kings, both, or neither; Whether or no, the old Lords, or the new; All the secluded Members, none, or few, Shall to this Parliament admitted be, Or to the next, and all men then be free To chuse, or to be chose: Whether this Sect, Or that; the supream Pow'r will best respect. So Justice henceforth over us may raign, And Truth may her due freedom still retain, I shall be pleas'd, and my endeavour bend To suffer, what I know not how to mend. Whatever GOD permits, his will be done: For, he is not a careless looker on, But, active in disposing to his ends, What, man, to his vain purposes intends: And, our designs will frustrate be for ever, Unless, with him concurrence we endeavour. The peoples voice is GOD's, the Proverb saies; And is so, many times, but, not alwaies. Their Voice is, that the best means to prevent Our threatned ruine, is a Parliament (Next under GOD) that must be truly free. This, I believe, but, gain'd how shall that be, Or when procur'd? If, none we free must call, But, when there is a freedom left to all To chuse, or to be chose; Some other way We must be sav'd before we see that day, Else we shall be destroy'd. Must we give Theeves (Who live but by their pardons and Reprieves) Pow'r, to dispose as they shall please to do Of our Estates, and think it reason too? To sober men appears it to be just, With murtherers to put our Lives in trust? To any wise men, will it prudence seem, To leave those Freedoms which we did redeem With bloud and vast sums, in the hands of those, From whom we won them, (being still our Foes?) Consent to take what freedom they will give us, Who are the men who did, and would inslave us? And, cauterized consciences permit In judgement, on our consciences to sit? Free Parliaments, can we call such as those? Or, think the Members of it freely chose, When they who much less worthy men do seem In others eyes, than in their own esteem, (And they, who have more wealth and pow'r, than grace, Wit, or sincerity) with shameless face, By bribes, threats, fawnings, or corrupted friends, Procure their own Elections for self ends? And when th'Electors likewise cheated are Of their free choice, by weakness, hopes, or fear? Call you that free, which was at first begot In bondage? Which, at full enjoyeth not A freedom yet? and, was to come and go, When others pleased were to have it so? Can that be free, or freemen make of us, Which is begot and constituted thus? To which a Coney-burrough, or a village, Not able with rents, labour, trade, and tillage, The Charges of one Burgess to maintain, Is as well priviledg'd, to send in twain Unto a Parliament, as any Shire Which doth two hundred times their burdens bear? And may corrupted be to make a choice Which will destroy three Nations, with one voice? But, if a Parliament thus chosen, be By Custome lawful, and reputed free; We must be as we are, till resolution Be taken up, to mend that Constitution. For though this Age to GOD alloweth not His choice, out of our chosen ones, by lot, (As when Matthias, after mans election, Was chose, when chusers had less imperfection:) And though this Lottery was thrown aside, Because it bounded Avarice and Pride; And pleas'd not them whose aime was to retain, Or to acquire pre-eminence and gain; Yea, though it hath, without good reason why, Been wav'd by Clergy and by Laity; By Lot, not only the first vacant place To an Apostleship supplied was, But, also, Saul thereby Election had Before he by the people King was made: Moreover, Achans crime when close conceal'd From humane knowledge, was by Lot reveal'd. Then, that Expedient, why should we explode, And, in things doubtful, shun the Test of GOD? His providence will order all we do, Whether, thereby we pleased are or no; And his concurrence in our choice by Lot Is just and needfull, though we like it not. For, of his Kingdom, we have oft confest, These Isles are part: Our noblest Interest Depends upon his Title and protection; They are now much endanger'd by defection From him, and by self-trust: That wicked one, Who hath in other Lands usurp'd his Throne, (And here in former Ages) doth intend To re-inslave us; he hath to that end Made up his Breaches; is (with false pretence Of doing right to wronged innocence) Now aiming to invade us, with a Pow'r, In probability, too strong for our; And, to resist, we have not many more Of chosen-ones, than made up heretofore, That little number, whereby (though so few) A mighty Army, Gideon overthrew, Through GOD's assistance, who compel'd their foes To make him way, by their self-overthrows, Because, he credit gave to his direction, Who sent him helpers by divine election; And shall we, in so visible a danger, Make him, that's most concern'd, to us a stranger? All, this premised, why should we refuse To let GOD chuse among us when we chuse? Or, thereupon distrustful grow, that we Shall in so doing, prosper worse than he? GOD, by despised helpers, oft enables; By Instruments that most esteem but bables; By Lamps concealed in weak earthen pots, And things much more to be despis'd than Lots. But, what expedient likelier can be found To fix that which is alwaies running round? Or, make a choice with which men pleas'd may be, Who, in so many matters disagree, Than (having chose as well as they can do) To let GOD add perfection thereunto? Since, when he lists, he can; and ever will Make all we act, effect his pleasure, still? This makes me, having acted what may seem Injoyn'd by reason, leave the rest to him. This makes me patiently to wait and heed Mens counteractings, with what will succeed; And, wait the more content, because I see, That, sometimes things contemned useful be In that which he at this time hath in hand, If his intents, I rightly understand. For my part, I will there no chuser be Of any, where GOD may not chuse with me; And, I their free choice also would refuse If (singly) Shire or Burrough me should chuse Without a Lot. But little need I feare My being put to such a trial here; For, one unfitting to be call'd unto That trust, most think me; and if not, I do: For, whose end can I serve, that am well known This Principle, and such as this to own? Or, who can hope I will to them be just, Who trust to none but him, whom they distrust? Let them who of themselves have high esteem Pursue that course which best to them shall seem, Set up what Pow'r, and make what Laws they please, I shall have comfort, though but little ease; And if instead of right, I still have wrong, My time of suffering, will not now be long. To whatsoever Pow'r, GOD, me subjects, I will obey it with all due respects Till he removes it; (as I still have done, Ev'n then, when I was censur'd to have gone Beside my Rule.) When Anarchy takes place By reason, to preserve the common peace, I'll use all good and likely means I may; Sing, whilst it lasteth; when it faileth, pray; That, though from me my Foes the out-works win, I may secure the Fortresses within, And, in the mean space, neither be perplext, Or scar'd, to think, who will enslave me next: For, he that trusts to an internal aid, Of no external Pow'r need be afraid. The troubles of this life will soon be past; The bliss that follows, will for ever last: And, I have seen the Authors of our troubles So oft blown up, and puft away like Bubbles, That much I am asham'd to think how poor My courage was to fear them heretofore. I know what Changes are now menaced, Yet, I'll attend them without servile dread. Let all those do the like, who have took part In this Republicks Cause with single heart; For, though, if he who doth our Peace prolong, Should follow those, who heretofore went wrong, To make them prosp'rous in their undertakings, Who may be mark'd out by their cursed speakings, (Their malice, slanders, and scurrilities Their great delight and confidence in Lies.) They must endure the sharpest blast that blew Within this Climate, since the world they knew; GOD, will vouchsafe them his assisting grace To bear it stoutly when it comes to pass, And, put a signal difference, between Those that have honest, and unfaithful been. A storm, is brewing, whereunto, perchance, The late North wind, hath given an advance; For, I perceive, (although from Camps or Courts There be where now I am, but few reports) Some Actings have produced an effect Much differing from what I did expect, And working on the common peoples passions According to their various inclinations; So that he must be wiser than Apollo, Who shall inform us, what events will follow. Some rail, some rave, some scoff, and some do jeer, Some ring, some sing, some hope, and some do fear, Some of them do insult, some others whine; But, all these whirlwinds shake no corn of mine: To my old Principles, I still am true, And will be, whatsoever Change ensue: Because, I am assur'd the Cause we had Was very good, though we our selves are bad; And, that, if after all our pains and cost We lose it, by our wickedness 'tis lost. And, for my part, my portion hath been such, That, if I lose all, I cannot lose much; Nor by my Foes be much worse dealt withall Than I have been by those whom Friends we call. The World can me of nothing disinvest, Save that, which heretofore my cares increast; And, though she somewhat more oppress me may, She shall not take my happiness away, Nor mar my hopes with all her scorns and brags, Although, she wears, and tears, my flesh to rags. I can be but abus'd, and ground between Two Mill-stones, as I hitherto have been. The favours of the World, to men upright, Makes them the more obnoxious to despight. If she, to place of Pow'r and Trust commends Well-minded men, 'tis but for her own ends: For, when her purposes to pass are brought By them, who, her preferments never sought, (And, others for her service fitter seem) The first she slights, with barb'rous disesteem, And them exposeth to disgraceful scorns, Because, no longer they can serve her turns. Therefore, though worse I speed than heretofore, My peace thereby shall be disturb'd no more, Than if I heard a drivelling fool did swear, His Bable, and Bell'd-cap, I should not wear. As well mine, I confess, as others crimes, Have multipli'd the troubles of these times; And, therefore, I must undergo my share, In what our National demerits are. But, they can never force me to despair, Because, I have a Mediators pray'r; And, such a gracious GOD to trust unto, As neither looks for more than men can do, Nor doth severely mark what's done amiss Through frailty, and without maliciousness. And, though, a real unsuccesseful zeal To do my duty to this Commonweal Hath lost me some friends, and foes made me many, I, am not a malicious foe to any; Nor were my suff'ings, since these wars begun, For any knavery, but, for having none: And, therefore, I shall thrive, when honest men May have a thriving time; but, not till then: And such a time (though by what's pre-declar'd, It may a very long time be deferr'd) May, very possibly, soon come to pass, If he, that shall have pow'r, hath also grace To use it prudently, when he receives it To that intent, for which GOD chiefly gives it; And shall vouchsafe a more indulgent eare To them, whose words, by deeds confirmed were, Than to the Complements of seeming friends, Who fawn upon him for sinister ends. To fortifie that hope, a little more, I have, (beside what is express'd before) Consider'd this, that, understanding men, Although they make some uses, now and then, Of Parasites, to them, no trust will give, Till they may be induced to believe That, Crows, which flock about a new-yean'd Lamb, (To pick his eyes out) to protect him came; That, they have oft observ'd, it is their guise, To worship all new Stars, when first they rise; Hosanna unto him, this day to cry, Whom they will next day seek to crucifie; Set up a Man of clouts, to be their King, Yea, honour as a God-head any thing, Whereby their present Lust may be enjoy'd, Though thereby, they at last may be destroy'd; And, when by their own faults they are distress'd, Curse their best friends, and those whom they have bless'd. But, this mans fortitude, I hope is such, That, their Bolts will not thereon batter much; For, GOD confers the Pow'r on him bestown, Ev'n for this Peoples sake, not for his own; And, if their trust in him, he should betray By whom he is, that which he is this day, His loss will be as great (perhaps much more) As their, who have, betray'd it heretofore. Whether to this, or to that Interest, He will decline, 'tis coming to the Test: For, he now standeth on that forged Y, Wherein, a right way, and a wrong doth lie; And, he shall hear a voice behind him, say, GEORGE, that's the left, and this the right hand way: This, leads to honour here, and future bliss; That way, the next way to destruction is: That way, the greatest number doth pursue; Yet, this the safest, although trod by few. Now, whether this, or that way he encline, The danger will be rather his, than mine. Whatever shall succeed, which more or less Obstructs th'enjoyment of our outward-peace, Me, 'twill not make much merrier, or much sadder, Than ratling of three blew beans in a bladder; So, GOD gives patience till the storm be past, And Truth and righteousness prevail at last. What, MONCK perhaps will do, or leave undone, May mar some Trifles, I have doated on; But, that, whereon my best hopes fixed be Doth lie secured betwixt GOD, and me. That, which conduceth to my noblest ends, No more on his, than his on mine depends, And, GOD, I know, will constantly proceed In prosecuting what he hath decreed Concerning this Republick, whatsoever He, we, or any other shall endeavour: And, when their falshhood, malice, and despight, Insultings, and vain hopes, are at the height, (Who, now, against this Commonwealth conspire To bring on such a Change as they desire) They shall but to and fro, like drunkards reel, Do, and undo, and run round in a wheel, Till they have made that, not to be endur'd, Whereby, they dream distempers may be cur'd; And, GOD shall fool their wisdom in that hour; So break their snares, and weaken so, their pow'r, That, what they did suppose would have o'rthrown His purposes, will quite destroy their own. This I believe, who oft-times have foreseen Contingent things, that have unlikely been: And, though for this, I may be flouted more Than for the like expressions heretofore, And more in hazard; I am not afeard To let them any where, be seen or heard, Nor will be discontent with him who shall Conceive of me, as Festus did of Paul; For, I expect not, that Grapes can be born Upon a Thistle, or Figs on a Thorn. And though the Scorners ask to what intent I have compos'd this Ribble-rabblement, (As they will call it) I, will tell them why, In meekness, that they may as well as I Be thereby profited; and (if their pride, Obstruct it not) lay prejudice aside. At first relation of the foresaid News, I stept aside, to counsel with my Muse, That, as I often do, I might thereby My heart against assailings fortifie: For, (my infirmities, I'll not dissemble) My flesh as prone is to look pale and tremble As other mens, if I neglect the cures That must be took for such distemperatures As are begot, by sudden informations Of accidents beyond our expectations. To which end, if I did not oft retire To seek by musings, what, GOD, will inspire, And thus preserve them in my slighted Rimes, I could not bear the burdens which these times Impose on me, or mine, and upon those Who first made head against our common foes By their encouragement, who had the pow'r, Which might have sav'd those whom they did devour, And have as well brought scorn and outward shame On those who acted with them, without blame, As on themselves; and, when GOD did restore Their Pow'r twice lost, still acted, as before. In that, and such like Cases, not in vain, I thus distill out from the heart and brain, The spirits of those many mus'd-on matters Which there I find, to make some cordial waters. For, though they, who confide in men and horse, Deride them, as meer whimsies of no force; They make me merry, when my heart was sad, They keep me sober, when men think me mad; And, by my musings also, now and then, The like effects are wrought on other men: For, they assist us to consider so, Those things, which men may; those, which GOD will do; What, we our selves must act; what, leave undone; What, may in reason, follow thereupon; What madness 'twere to overcharge with sorrow The present day, with dreading more to morrow; Or, mar our sleep, by being discontented At what may not be, or not be prevented, That, I take up what likely hopes I may My present fears or doubtings to allay; And fix my confidence on him, by whom, I am assured help at last will come: And he still sends in, (when I know not where To find supply for things that needful are) So much, as may support me to persever In what I am obliged to endeavour. I, am as sensible, as most men are, Of all those Dangers, which do now appear; And, till with GOD, I had convers'd awhile, GEORGE MONCK with all his Forces in this Isle, And all that He and Mountague can do At Sea and Land, with help of LONDON too, Could put me in no hope they should prevent The perils which appeared imminent: But, now, though all their Forces they should bend Against that Cause, which we hope they befriend, And, all the strength both Spaine &amp; France can bring, Were joyned to impose on us a King Without Conditions, I should not repent My Principles, or fear the consequent. Because, if by his coming, he shall heal Our wounds, and breaches, we are safe and well; And if he come in vengeance, we shall taste A bitter Cup, and, he the dregs, at last. For, having as Appendants to that Pow'r Sins unrepented, and as great as our, Which daily will encrease, when they come in, SIN, shall do execution upon sin: Prophaness, joyning hands with superstition, And, Sanctity dissembled, with Ambition; They shall so plague each other, that, if ten Of honest and true-hearted English men Be left in ev'ry thousand, and, together Knit in true Charity fast to each other, They shall be a RESERVE, to make this Nation More prosp'rous in another Generation, I, would have said, before this year be gone, If, I, had now seen Justice better done; Or, any probability perceiv'd, That, what I should declare, would be believ'd. But, peradventure, 'tis a day too late, This day, on any terms to promise that, Which yet, expected is, by some of them, Who, have the means neglected, and the time. For, Charles those great advantages hath won By what hath been omitted, and miss-done, (Which, I long since foresaw) that, though his Pow'r MONCK shall employ for us; nor his, nor our, Nor both united; nor a Parliament, Established with full and free consent, Of all the People; (if by penitence, GOD, reconciled be unto that Prince) Can at this present, make the scale so even, (Vnless our peace be likewise made in heaven) But, that there will be ten for one, at least, To weigh him out his claimed Interest, And, force us those conditions to receive, Which he himself shall pleased be to give. For, our great Wars, confusions, and dissenting, Will frustrate so, endeavours of preventing Our fears, and setling true peace, in that way, Whereby, we for a settlement assay; That he, by whom, lost hopes reviv'd became, May accidentally, without just blame, Through breach of trust, make way to bring him in, Who, hitherto hath most opposed bin. For, that, which cures, where one distemper lies, Kills, where are complicated maladies: Or, else, at least, produceth an effect Much differing, from what we did expect. If still both Parties be the same they were, They rather shall encrease confusions here Than qualifie them: and, for ought that, yet, To me appeareth likely to beget A better hope: nought, Reason offers us, But this; GOD, grant it prove no worse than thus. If, he be qualifi'd, as now some say He is; and as (for ought I know) he may, That will be then effected, which few thought Could have here whilst they liv'd to pass been brought. And, if to GOD, he reconciled be, Why, not to men? Or, wherefore not to me, Who, never was for self-respects to him An Adversary, or, a friend to them Who were his Enemies, for being so, But, as he was, or seem'd to be, a Foe To GOD and Justice? If, he be not such, Why should I doubt his favour? Or, fear much His wrath? For, doubtless, if he be upright, He, then, in honest men will take delight; Yea, peradventure, may have need of one To do such services as I have done, Without regarding greatly what men shall Be pleased, or displeased therewithall; And, if he be a Tyrant, I know why He, will have greater cause to fear, than I. If, her, who with her Cup of fornications Hath long made drunk the Kings of many Nations, He hath not pledg'd in secret; nor, so long Drunk her inchantments, that they are too strong To be expell'd, there may be perfect cures For all meer natural distemp'ratures, Whereby, he from Impostures may depart, To own what GOD hath written in his heart. And, then, it will be evidently seen Which way, he might a glorious King have been, Who, now is none; and what the Parliament, Which promised to make him such, then meant; For, he that governs men, must righteous be, And, there is no such glorious King as he. When King and People are confin'd by Laws Neither the Princes, nor the Peoples Cause Can be infring'd; and questionless, if he Inclin'd to such a condescention be; This would, when both sides thereunto submit, Good will to men, and peace on earth, beget; And, both GOD's Justice, and his mercy too It would illustrate, if it might be so. For, GOD's Long-suff'ring doth abide for ever; And, Judgements, very seldom times, or never, Are past by such an absolute Decree, As, by Repentance not revers'd to be; Nor doth he look, that, man's Repentance should Proportion with his Deviations hold, Since his Free Grace, a standing help supplies, To make amends for those deficiencies. Manasses, guilty of sins most abhorr'd, Was cast out of his Kingdom, and restor'd; Yea, and this Parliament, whose Crimes are more Ten times, than his, were twice shut out of doore; Yet, now in grace again (God grant they may Take heed of falling the third time away,) For, GOD, will then perhaps, the second time, (As he did of the rest) make proof of him. What he will do, is known to him alone, Because, he only knows, what will be done By them, to whom Conditions are declar'd With threatnings, and a promised reward, As they shall be neglected, or fulfill'd; Or, men are either well, or evill-will'd: For, they, the Devil's, not GOD's, Prophets are, Who, absolutely, either peace, or war, Or shame, or honour, poverty, or wealth, Or life, or death, or sicknesses, or health) Shall promise unto them, who have transgress'd Without conditions tacite, or express'd; And they are Fools abus'd by ill suggestions, Who tempt men, by demanding of such questions. Yet, GOD, sometimes indulgently complies With us, ev'n in our curiosities; And, otherwhile, unsought for, giveth hints, To prove us by conditional events. Among some other things, made signes to me, When, here a setled Government should be, My Britains Genius hath long since recorded A signal previous one, which is thus worded: Brit. Genius, Pag. 100. A King, shall willingly himself un-king, And, thereby, grow far greater than before, &amp;c. This, in the meaning, might have twice, ere this Fulfill'd have been; and once, in Terminis, If Pride, self-will, and frowardness of mind, Had not, by false lights, made true Reason blind. And, if that he, whom it will most concern, Shall now, GOD's visitation-time discern, (Not letting opportunities depart, By suff'ring vain hopes to obdure his heart) When GOD shall on his soul begin to strike, A call to penitence, Manasseth-like, But, meekly comes, and laies revenge aside, All self-will, animosities, and pride; It shall have such effects the self-same hour, On these three Nations, by a secret pow'r, As, will so change them too, that, ere the Sun Is at his next height, and through Cancer run, It will amaze the World; their Foes confound Make some believe, all things are wheeling round; Or, think, that Revolution drawing near Which must conclude the great Platonick-year; And, good, to many Realms, 'twill pre-divine Betwixt the Tropicks on both sides the Line. This, doubtless, will by no man be withstood Who seeks his own weal in the common good, And, doth not either strive to have possession Of other mens concernments, by oppression, Or, is displeas'd with ev'ry Government, Save that, which his own wisdom shall invent. If this, may be vouchsaf'd, or, any thing Which might appear to have a modelling By GOD's, and Natures Laws; I am so far, From Jonah's frowardness, when, GOD, did spare Great Niniveh, that, though it quite dissented, From all that I have aimed at, or hinted, (Here, or elsewhere) I, therein should rejoyce, And praise Almighty GOD, with heart and voyce, That, though he both did threaten to destroy, He lets both parties, at the last enjoy More grace than they deserve; and turns to them, In mercy, though they turn not, yet, to him: For, my endeavours wholly were bestown, To have GOD's mind fulfilled, not mine own; And, whether he in mercy or in wrath To give us Kings again, determin'd hath; If he, shall bring one hither, I'll receive him With such obedience as I ought to give him; And, praise GOD for his Justice, though his hand Shall smite me first of any in this Land. But, I shall not believe he hath Commission To raign here, by GOD's grace, or his permission, Untill he gets admittance by th'Assents Of these three Nations in their Parliaments; Or, by re-conquest: Nor, will I desist From still adhering to that Interest Which we possess, and, on Appeals from heaven, Was by GOD's Doom, unto this People given: But, I'll assert it, while life shall endure, Or, till for sin, GOD, takes the forfeiture Of what he gave; and absolutely shall Translate it; or, on terms conditionall: Or, till I see our diff'rences decided, And, how the Pow'r now claim'd shall be divided. Mean while, I neither to be saved from His wrath, or, to find grace in time to come, Will have with him compliance; lest I wrong That Pow'r to which my services belong: Nor, will I, whilst this lasts, one deed assay Which tendeth to removing it away. Nay, notwithstanding it should me oppress, And, ill requite me for my faithfulness, I would not tell in secret, how it should Supplanted be, although, perhaps, I could: Except, in telling Charles, his Resignation, Will be the best means of that supplantation: For, though the Cause, I fought for, were unjust, I am a Traytor if I break my trust. Yea, though thereof, I be well satisfied, If I shall turn unto the other side Before that trust, I, totally resign, With all that Pow'r, which by that trust was mine, Or, make my self a starting hole, whereby I may be false, with shews of Loyalty. The Royal Pow'r, I loyally obey'd; And, though it did oppress, was so afraid Of innovating; that a Reformation Thereof I wished, not an extirpation. But, when by other men, through GOD's permission It was remov'd; to that, did yield submission, Which then succeeded; and so would have done, Had twenty been admitted one by one, In whom I saw the soveraign pow'r reside, And, with most visibility abide: For, ev'ry private person it behoves, Till that whole Orbe, wherein he's fixed, moves, To keep his place, not medd'ling any way To overthrow the Pow'r he should obey. Let that MONCK, whom I see but through a cloud, (And may two faces hide beneath one hood,) Consider this; and take heed, lest he may By fair appearances be led astray, And make his Pow'r to over-balance that Which must be weigh'd out, by their free debate To whom it appertains: for, they alone, Must, now, untill their own set time is gone, Determine that which in suspence doth stand; And, if the Pow'r then slip into his hand, (As possibly it will) he then may do What GOD and his own conscience prompts him to. Mean while, it will behove him to be wary; For, if an equal hand he shall not carry, As their Affairs now stand, 'twill treason be, Ev'n in the most superlative degree; And, shall be, doubtless, in the final swinge Rewarded with superlative revenge, Whether the Pow'r, from whom his Pow'r he had Were perfect, or, some way imperfect made, Either by their own faults, or other mens; For, his defects have no excuse from thence: Because, a servants trust, must be maintain'd, How e'r their Masterships, his Masters gain'd. Let him consider well, that, he is bound To them in that state, wherein them he found When they intrusted him; till their own Acts, Or, providence, invalid those Contracts; Or, totally annihilates the Band By which they mutually obliged stand; And, that, if they, through what he shall miss-do, Be either forc'd, misled, or frighted to Those condescentions, which may quite destroy That Pow'r, by which he did his Pow'r enjoy, His Faith is broke; unless, he do his best, To re-impow'r them; or, make good, at least, That End, for which GOD and the people gave To them, and him, the Pow'r which now they have. And, this, (if there befall an oversight) Must be endeavoured with all his might; For, ev'ry promise, vow, and undertaking, Repugning this, is made null in the making; And, all the bloud which is in this Cause shed, Will down be showr'd, in vengeance on his head, Who shall to wrong the Common right endeavor, And in that prosecution still persever. This is the Judgement, which this day, my Musings, Dictate (as I think, by divine infusings) To some good purposes, if we repent That Course, which yet obstructeth GOD's intent. And, when that mad distemper is allay'd Which frustrates all that can be writ or said. These Principles, by musing, I assay To keep up, in my self; and, as I may, To build in others, thereby, to encrease Their faithfulness, and settle common-peace. These Principles, so long as that Pow'r lasts Which is in being, though it dayly wastes, Is much contemn'd; (and without likelihood Of ought effecting for the publike good) Compels me conscientiously to wave All self-respects; and all those which I have To them, whose welfare is to me more dear Than mine own life, and all things mortal are, Rather, than I those duties would neglect, Which, I think, may the common-peace effect, (Though duties nor exacted, nor regarded, But, oft, with injuries, and spights rewarded.) Yea, still, though most my purposes deride, And, make me scorn'd of Fools on either side; I, take up all occasions to re-mind them Of needful Cautions which they cast behind them, As now I do, and heretofore have done: Sometimes, foretelling, what would fall thereon, And, then, remembring them as I saw need, How, that which was foretold them, did succeed; That, them (if possible) reduce I may Before it be too late, into that way, Wherein they may be safe; for, they have bin Long out, and likely, never to come in, Till GOD, by what he seems about to do, (Or, some such way) shall force them thereunto. For, 'tis not that course which hath practis'd bin, Our putting this man out, and that man in; Our punishing, of some for miss-conceiving Their duties; nor, our giving, or forgiving, According as our ends, it may effect, Or, as we favour, or, else dis-respect; Nor our Prudentials, though they did excell The plots and counsels of Achitophel, That will procure our safety; or, succeed Much better, at this present, than his did. No sure Conclusions, can be grounded on That, which this General hath lately done, Although, to make his passage hither smooth, He Lambert foyl'd, as Lambert foiled Booth; For, men, and humane actions, whatsoe'r They promise, or portend, so trustless are, That, none can yet know, whether of the Three Shall to himself, or us, most prosp'rous be; Though, for the present, there is in the One Hope of much good, and in the other none. 'Tis not discov'ring of each others shame, (And of those dunghils, out of which they came) By suff'ring scurrilous base Pamphleteers To fill the streets, with slanders, lies, and jeers, Till there is hardly left us time and room Of useful Truths, informed to become. Nor preaching Swordmen, nor the fighting Priests, Are they, who must support our Interests. Nor they, who make our publike plagues the more By shutting private mercies out of door: For doubtless they, who, find not time, to hear A man oppressed, once in twice four year, Though urg'd with frequent importunities, Will make GOD's ears as deaf unto their cries. 'Tis not our Fellowship with pious friends, Made instrumental for meer carnal ends: 'Tis not our eagerness to miss-apply The grace of GOD, and cloud it with a Lie, Which will endear, and make us acceptable To him, who to deliver us is able. Nor is't our formal Off'rings, or our zeal To GOD, and safety of this Commonweal Pretended, by our weeding from his Corn Those, whom he doth command to be forborn Till harvest-time, (lest, as we dayly do, Among the Tares, we pluck up good wheat, too) That, will be our protection from the smart And sting of Conscience, when GOD tries the heart; Nor from those outward plagues, which many run To meet, in hope, by that course, them to shun. 'Tis neither our, nor the designs of those Who, to this Commonwealth are open foes, That help, or harm us: For, none can contrive Worse mischieves, than both Parties do derive From their own projects; (as it would appear If, they of their successes heedful were.) Nor will it be our having of a King Or no King good or bad, that peace will bring To either side, till they shall better heed How mis-advisedly they do proceed. Nor is't a pack'd, peec'd, or, new Parliament, Elected by a general assent, That will repair us, though it might be had: But, some things, whereof small account is made, As we shall shortly find, when we have tri'd What, by exper'ence will be verifi'd, Some will desire to know them: would they could As heartily desire it, as they should, And mend what is amiss, when they do know it, As easily as I can truly show it. It is, that Mercy, and that righteousness, Which, hypocritically we profess, When we do shut our doors, our eyes, and ears, Against the sad Petitions, cries, and tears Of men oppress'd, and cast away that Bread To dogs and swine, that Children should have fed. 'Tis self-denial, and not that alone Which ought by all men to be undergone, But also that in chief, which by a Vote Was once pretended, and e'r since forgot. It is a conscientious reparation Of this Republicks Faith, whose violation Makes all unprosp'rous which we take in hand; And, which hath brought a Curse upon this Land That will not be remov'd, till we have payd Those Vows, which have been shamelesly delay'd. 'Tis want of meekness upon either side, And Charity, which (making men divide, And subdivide) doth day by day, encrease Those Discords, which destroy the common peace; For, nor mens wrath, nor their Phanatick zeal, Compleats GOD's will, or cures the Commonweal, Or edifies his Church: But, Righteousness, And Truth profess'd, with sincere soberness. 'Tis these things, that must cure our Grand disease, And, if we perish, 'tis through want of these. These, are the sins, (as often heretofore I have affirm'd, and say it now once more) Which have destroy'd, and totally laid waste Great Monarchies, and States in Ages past. Yet, to these Crimes, this Age hath added many, Beside hypocrisie, the worst of any. Yea, they have crown'd them with impenitencies For sins committed under fair pretences; With perseverance in them, whilst GOD's hand Is stretched forth in anger o'er this Land. And, it is Penitence for these Transgressions, As also, for our manifold omissions, That must prevent the plagues now coming on. GOD, grant, it may be timely, thought upon; And, this, therewith, in season minded too; That, we in conscience, are oblig'd to do As much as possibly we shall be able To seek preventing of that miserable And sad condition, whereto they are brought, Who, for the common Interest, have fought By their injoynments, (who then managed The Pow'r, which their obedience warranted) And, thereto, not alone contributed Their Livelihoods, but, in their service shed Their precious bloud, with hazard of their lives, And ruine to their children, and their wives; Whom, if we slightly leave indempnifi'd, Will raise the loudest CRY that ever cri'd; Make all men say, (who have their Cause well scann'd) That honest men by knaves have been trapann'd; Fulfill, what, in my OPOBALSAMVM, I, fifteen years now past, foretold should come; And in some other Premonitions too, (Though heeded not) nigh forty years ago. Yea, and, bring Vengeance, ev'n on those who shall Suppose, it them concerneth not at all; For, most, one way or other, guilty be, And from the punishment, few shall be free. What pinch was that? Oh gracious GOD! where art? Stay by me: For, a sudden twinge at heart, So gripeth it, with an injected fear, As if some dreadful thing, were drawing near. Waves, after waves, begin (methinks) to roul, And, are come up, ulmost, ev'n to my soul. Yet, why my soul, art thou cast down in me? What is it, that can thus disquiet thee? Still, trust in GOD; thy self to him resigne: For, thou art his, and he is truly thine. Although the Waters roar, the waves mount high, And we are far from shore, yet, GOD is nigh; Although the ship sinks, he can, if he please, Make us, with safety, walk upon the Seas; And, if we down into the Deeps must go, There, we shall find him, and enjoy him too. Take courage then, my heart, firm credit give, To what he promiseth, and thou shalt live. This pang is wholly past, and all my fear Is now, for them, who, senceless do appear Of their own hazards; who are without dread Of that destruction which hangs o'er their head; And, who have help and peace expected from Those hills, from whence, their welfare cannot come; As, they would soon find, if they heedful were What winds breathe from them, and what fruits they bear. How long! how long! shall GOD unto this place Make dis-respected offers of his Grace? How often, since great failings first begun, Hath he provoked almost ev'ry one, Apart, or joyntly? Ceasing not to prove By Judgements and by mercies interwove, How difficultly, either Grace or Nature Can work upon a self-corrupted Creature? By all things which may any way relate To soul or body, credit or estate We have been call'd upon, one way or other; By sweet, and sharp things, and both mixt together. By what to our chief joy, and sorrow tends; By servants, neighbours, kindred, and by friends; By sicknesses, and health; by scorns, and jeers; By shame, and honour, and by hopes, and fears: By other mens examples, GOD, forewarns; Sometimes, by our own suff'rings, wisdom learns; One while by wise men, and true Prophets teaches, Sometimes, by Wizards, fools, and children preaches; Then, last of all, when no effect these take, By things (as now) like Bal'ams Ass, doth speak: And, that, which all this, probably presages, Is (without swift repentance) Bal'ams wages; Which will be surely paid, when they who may Prevent it yet, shall give their pow'r away: Unless that Mercy, which no ending hath, Shall once again, put off the day of wrath; (Now near approaching) when, in few, or none, There shall be any hope it may be done. So, for a while, my mad fit now is over, Would other mad men might as soon recover; And, be as sober in their Intervalls, As I have hope to be, whatere befalls. Thus, once again, although that heretofore, In this mode, I resolved to write no more, (As, justly, otherwhile, the Parliament Revokes their Orders, when impertinent To Common safety) I, have boldness took, For like respects, my purpose to revoke. And, though, as our Cause now at hazard lies, Most men will judge me far more bold than wise, To own these Musings, I so dreadless am, That, to attest them, I subscribe this Name At Hambledon, Feb. 19. 1659. George Wither. A Postscript to Mr. R. Hamon, Merchant. SIR, That Letter, which to you I lately sent, On second Rupture of this Parliament, I am inform'd, by some, this censure had, That, doubtless, when I wrote it, I was mad: (As I, perhaps, might have been long ago, Had, I their wit, whom troubles maketh so.) They know not what it aimes at, I hear say; But, were they not more mad than I, they may: For, from the whole Contents, they may collect What, of their hopes, will be the sad effect; And, draw forth also from it, this Conclusion, That, they, and I, and all are in confusion; That, neither Army, Parliament, or King, Or any other sub-celestial thing, Can have a self-sufficiency to cure Our present Ruptures, and distemperature, As we are now distemper'd; till a Pow'r Therewith concur, transcending their, and our: Till Righteousness with Mercy is inthron'd; Till selfness, and self-ends are more disown'd: Till ev'ry single person shall apart Reform his Will, his Actions, Words, and Heart; Or, so endeavours it, that one by one, We, may do that, which yet by none is done, Untill to Numbers, Vnites do encrease, And make at last, those Numbers numberless. Such Ends, as these, I aim'd at; and perchance, If they, had more Wit and less Ignorance, Who censur'd me, their prudence had discern'd My purpose, or more soberness had learn'd, Or, peradventure, they had understood, That, should I then have written in a mood More absolute, of things concerning those Who were of diff'ring Judgements, friends, and, foes, It might have added fewel, to encrease Those flamings, which did then infringe our peace; And wholly have made void that honest end Which, I did in simplicity intend. For, had I magisterially exprest What I dislik'd, or own'd, or judged best To be resolv'd on; I should have appear'd A Party, and by neither side been heard Without suspect, that I would have acquir'd, Not what was best, but, what I most desir'd. Much, therefore, positively to declare I purpos'd not; but somewhat to prepare All Parties, without frowardness of heart To weigh those things, which joyntly, or apart, Would most concern them; and, then, make that use, Which an Atonement soonest might produce. I, somewhat further, might Apologize; But, this, on my behalf, may well suffice, Who, more for others sakes, than for mine own, These words and Lines, have thus together thrown. FINIS. Speculum Speculativum: OR, A CONSIDERING-GLASS; Being an INSPECTION Into the present and late sad Condition Of these NATIONS; With some CAUTIONAL EXPRESSIONS made thereupon, by GEORGE WITHER, Immediately after His MAJESTIES Restauration: To preserve in himself and others a Christian Obedience to GOD's various dispensations. Hereby also are some Glimmerings discovered Of what will probably ensue hereafter. ?Fiat Justitia, Ruat Cœlum: Rather than Justice should bee made a scorn, Let all the Planets, from their Sphears bee torn. And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, thou shalt read these words; and when thou hast made an end of reading this Book, thou shalt binde a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates, and say, Thus shall Babylon sink, Jer. 51. 63. To the KING'S MAJESTY, If this Considering-Glass comes accidentally to his View. Sir, Blest is hee that in Gods Name doth come, In which Name I pronounce your welcome home; And, for your Health more heartily do pray, Than any one who drinks it every day. As often too, I have you in my thought As they, who with the first your favour sought; VVhich, if my heart you could as plainly see As what you now read, would beleeved bee. VVhen I had first compos'd what here ensues, I wisht it where you might the same peruse: For, men unknown (or known without respect) So justly are affronted with neglect, For proffer'd Services to those, that have More Off'rings daily than they can receive, That, I committed this to his Dispose VVho orders ev'ry thing that comes or goes. If Providence hath brought this to your hand, Give up to REASON straight, the sole command Ov'r all your Passions; Make her of your Isle, (Your Isle of MAN) Queen-Regent, all the while You are perusing it; and let it bee Read through, else it will wrong both You and Me. (Or you like Cæsar, unperus'd perchance, May leave that, which your welfare might advance) To bee her Subject, but so long endeavour As till that's done, and then, bee King for ever, (Reigning with her) as absolute a Prince, As ever had ov'r men pre-eminence: For, then shall that, to you more glory add, Than hitherto from any Pen you had; And, bee to you, a true Mnemosyne, When, peradventure, none so dares to bee. This Glass (though form'd it be of Common matter And, made by him, who knows not how to flatter If, to a Prince who needs it, it were sold, Were worth to him three times his weight in gold, If he knew how to use it as hee should: Yet I had rather you for nothing had it, So that it wrought th'effect for which I made it, Than, from another, to receive that price In ready money, paid mee over twice: For, then, this Book (which hath not to your praise One single Page) thereto should Trophies raise More glorious, than, your LONDONS wealth could rear, If wholly, thereupon consum'd it were. Your Happiness and Honour it intends: By not commending, it much more commends, Than all their Panegyricks who bestrow Those men with praises whom they do not know; And, magnifie, when they ascend the Throne, All Kings alike; which praise is less than none; For, 'tis a Mock deserving but returns Of sharp reproofs, or of neglect and scorns. If, wise and pious, you I had not thought, I such like Gew-gaws, could to you have brought To put out of your minde, what GOD for you Hath lately done; and what you ought to do For Him and His. But neither self-esteem, Nor verbal Attributes can perfect him By whom, here, shall bee an Establishment Of Justice in a Righteous Government. For, none else, but a self-denying King, Shall that great Blessing to these Nations bring; And, his Name will be thereby honour'd more Than all his Predecessors heretofore. And, they, who then live shall fulfill'd behold What Britains Genius, long ago foretold: For, I believe, that such a one will bee, And also, much desire, you may bee hee A King you are, who, now twice born hath been To Royalty; and therefore, by that Mean A Childe of honour, by Regeneration You seem to bee: and in the common fashion To celebrate your double birth, it could With your condition no proportion hold; For that Cause, in a path by no man trod, I seek to do you honour in this Mode, Which if accepted, your true praise will be; And, peradventure no disgrace to mee. For as a Lady looking in a Mirrour, Puts on her Dress, and Jewels without errour, Heeding what is misplaced, or forgot, And to her Handmaid alwayes trusteth not; So, by this Glass, you may have by reflection A sight of what pertains to your perfection: See, not with others, but, with your own eyes, Whether true Ornaments, or some Disguise, Bee put upon you, which may render you Less lovely, when you come in open view. Herein, a Catalogue to you is shown Of many long-lost Jewels of the Crown; And such as add the most Essential Glory Unto those Crowns that are but transitory. A Course is offered here, whereby you may Out-do, all that, which Flatterers can say: (Or, by but so far forth endeav'ring it, As Humane Frailties will the same permit) To praise you here, I do not undertake; But, that your self praise-worthy you may make Is my design, by bringing things to minde, VVhich written in your own heart you shall finde. This shews the Means to make you honourable VVith what should alwayes bee inseparable From your own person, and doth also tend To your Immortal Glory without end: It, such an honour gives, as will increase In their despight, who seek to make it lesse: An honour which depends not on mens tongues, VVhich Envy blasteth not, nor Malice wrongs; VVhich neither Degradations, nor Advances, Or, any humane Changes or Mischances Can blemish: for, it will be much more clear Than that Star, which within our Hemisphear Shin'd on your Birth-day, whilst the Sun at height Display'd his beams to hide it from our sight. Somewhat, by that, perhaps, portended was; So will there be by this Considering-Glass. God grant my meaning be so understood. That, now it may an Omen be for Good, By great Afflictions you were lately prov'd, VVhich are in mercy totally remov'd. At present, by as great prosperities, Your Temper, and your Faithfulness God tries. And that things useful slip not out of thought, This, to your hands, by Providence was brought. Be pleased seriously to look thereon, For, you will finde it a true Lydian-stone; And if you bide the Touch, WORDS are too poor To celebrate your Worth; who can say more? Your Majesties Loyal Subject, GEO. VVITHER. [George, wer't not fit, ere from thy hands it pass] In stead of a Dedication, or an Epistle to the Reader, this Expostulation of the Author with Himself, is here inserted. George, wer't not fit, ere from thy hands it pass To dress thy self by thy Considering-Glass? It hath now six months been expos'd to show, And some say, Forth in publick let it go. Some, cry, Conceal it; for it may undo thee, Or at the best, bring outward mischief to thee. Say, shall, or shall I not divulge the same? Shall it be spar'd, or given to the flame? Quickly, resolve, before it bee too late, And Cautions needful, grow quite out of date. Dost thou beleeve, that many men will read it? Or, if they do, that any much will heed it? Except it bee, to seek how to abuse thee. Or, finde out somewhat whereof to accuse thee? What ever thou shalt write, Self-interest No more will entertain, then shall consist With her own Principles. Thou, to the SOT Writ'st Greek: the worldly-wise regard it not; And if, among Swine, thou thy pearls dost cast, They'l tear thee, or defile thee at the least. Yet, if thy Conscience doth incline thee to it, More fear thou to neglect it, than to do it; For, from thy Duties thou art not excus'd, Although thy pains bee slighted and abus'd. And, it were better, mischief should befall Unto one single person, then to all: He perishing with an ill Conscience too, Because, hee did not, what hee ought to do. To make this, and transcribe it, I confess, Much pains requir'd not, and the cost is less. In Ink and Paper: yet, perhaps, it may Be better worth, than to be thrown away: And though to my particular offence It may redound, a tenfold recompence, It will repay thy Country by return: And for thy self alone, thou art not born. My Country! why, perhaps my Country-men, Think, they need not my service; and, what then? Am I oblig'd, if they bee minded so, To serve them still, whether they will or no? I, fifty years, have serv'd them in my turn, To that end, for which (I think) I was born, For no reward, but injuries and scorn. They, my Good Meanings, have repay'd with ill, And, can it be expected, I should still, Serve them on such hard terms? Then, so I will. Hast thou composed, without fear or wit, What, may mens discontented humours fit? Scribled enough, since here the Scœne did alter, To purchase Newgate, or, to win a Halter? If so, and that which is deserved follows, They will, perhaps, attend thee to the Gallows: There, either rail upon thee, or, else say, Thou wert a bold fool, and so go their way. And, if thou writ'st but sober Truth and Reason, Or, that, which wise men think to be in season, This will be all the world will give the for't, She'll say, that, Thou, not worth the hanging art. Not, worth the hanging! Hah! that's somewhat tho; And may be worth as much, for aught I know, As to be made a Viscount, or an Earl, A Marquess, or a Duke? For, great my Earthly Expectations are not, And, if they come to nothing, much I care not. I know, which way, to make mine honour greater Than that, for which I must become a Debter To other men; and, can augment the same By that, which some do think, will do me shame. But, hark! in policy a while delay To publish this; thou hast a Game to play For Prelats Lands, which lately purchas'd were; Thy Claims thereto, now in great hazard are, And, thou, wilt both to borrow, and to pay, Disabled bee, if they bee took away: Thy other Lands, by Cheaters were bereft, And, if thou lose these too, there's nothing left. Their Temp'ralties, must bee restored again, And, thou concerning them, writ'st here, such plain, Such down-right Truths, that if there should be found Surviving (or, new made) on English Ground A Bishop who will then thy cause befriend, It may presage that all the rest will mend: And, that, here constituted, wee shall see, Such Bishops, as Saint Paul said they should bee: (Which our Scotch-brethren, I suppose, will grant To bee within, our Solemn Covenant) But, that, is in great hazard; therefore, try Their Holiness, and their Humility: And if, as may bee wish'd, thou shalt not speed, Then, with what thou intendest streight proceed. Out! Out Upon't! this Motion is so evil, That, 'tis a meer suggestion of the Devil. This, is that foolish policy, that brings Destruction upon Nations, and their Kings. 'Tis in effect, as if my heart should say, Do, as most Worldlings do; and when that way Thou proved hast, and thereby reap'st no good, From thenceforth, put thy trust alone in GOD. No, no; I bought those Lands without offending My Conscience, or a wrong to them intending: And either still mine by GOD's help I'll make them, Or, let the Prelates, if it must be, take them; Although I know them no Appurtenance To them belonging by GOD's Ordinance. A Covenant within his sight I took, Which, though by some is sleighted be, and broke, I dare not sleight it so, but, to this hour Have kept it (and will keep it) to my pow'r. Art thou then thus resolv'd? Yes, and till death Resolved am, whilst I have Pen or Breath, Thus to be still resolv'd, unless GOD leaves mee, Or else to change my mind his warrant gives mee. I'll trust GOD in the first place, not the last Alone, and when all other hopes are past. If Prelates, Parliaments, and Kings bereave mee Of all I have, He, helpless will not leave mee. But, probable it seems, that, if hereby Imprisonment, or extreme Poverty Befals now thou art old, that they who most Thy hazard urge, will leave thee to be lost: What if they do? thou hast a better hold: GOD leaveth no man because hee is old; And never had he firm Dependences On him, that's frighted with such Toyes as these. Recall to mind, that many years ago, When such Adventures thou wert urg'd unto It fell out otherwise. But there is yet Another fear: Therefore consider it. Thou hast Relations, who to thee are dear; May these not suffer more than they can bear, By what may come? Alas! I'll not dissemble, My feares for them, do make my flesh to tremble; And when I minde their hazards and their fears, Spight of Philosophy I let fall tears. But why, my Soul, art thon dejected so? My Heart, why sad within mee, dost thou grow? Still trust in GOD, for hee will bee their aid. Of these vain Bug-bears be thou not afraid; For they are GOD's much more than they are thine: To him therefore the charge of them resign This needless care, is but for Three, at most, And, to the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, If thou commit them, hee will raise up Friends To make for all their losses large amends. But, they have said, and so do many say, That men are much estranged at this day From what they were: that, in these latter times They are grown much more hardned in their crimes, And far less sensible than they were then Of sufferings, which befel to honest men, Who (when their pains might that way be bestown) Preferr'd the common good before their own: And that their number too, who now are griev'd, Is more than their, by whom to be reliev'd, They may have hope. Alas! if it be thus, GOD only can, and he must succour us. If it be so, our case is very sad: Yet fear not, Balm in Gilead may be had. Thy Pains, and this Adventure such times need: On good Intentions, good Effects succeed; And, hee at last will finde it so, who scatters His Bread, although it be upon the waters: For God is still the same; his Truth will never Be Falshood, but continue Truth for ever. Hee, who thee hath preserv'd so many years Amid so many Dangers, Foes, and Fears, As thou hast passed through (and thy Oppressors Destroy'd from time to time, with their Successors) Will still preserve thee; or, else, thither take thee From them, where, hee'l secure for ever make thee; And, be to Wife and Children at their need, A Husband, and a Father in thy steed. Well; I beleeve this; with my self, therefore Hereof, I will expostulate no more. I have so well, in my Considering-Glass, View'd, what my heart now is, with what it was, And, for what may befall, prepar'd it so, That, whither GOD will send it, let it go: Take it among you, Newters, Friends, and Foes, And his Will be fulfilled, WIN or LOSE: Who since I am excused from the cost Of Publication (because all I've lost) Will in the best time, some mans heart incline To add his contribution unto mine; That, what now six months hath perused been In private, may more publickly bee seen. Geo. Wither. Decemb. 13. 1660. SPECULUM SPECULATIVUM: OR, A CONDERING-GLASSE; Composed, June XIII. DMCLX. The Contents. Our Modern Prophet (so did Paul, A well known Heathen Poet call) Doth, in the Muses Mode relate This Nations past, and present state. Shews us, in this Considering Glass, What, shall hereafter come to pass, According as, we do sulfil, Or, cross GOD's manifested Will. Shews by what light he doth behold Those things that are by him foretold. Prayes for the King, and minds him too, In praying for him, what to do. Some things, which to himself pertain, He intermixeth not in vain) Which will as much advantage them Who sleight them not as profit him. And by the number of the Beast, Bounds the last year of Antichrist. Though of my Friends, I may almost professe, As did Elias, in another case, I know not one (not one of those at least, Who friendship for meer civil ends profest) Yet here this day, may many thousands be VVho are my real friends, unknown to mee: Yea, peradventure many among those VVho at this present time are thought my Foes. To them therefore, I wishing Grace and Peace; Do now, where ere they live, these Lines address To fortifie their faith, and them incline By their endeavours to help strengthen mine; And that by our Petitions joyntly made, VVe may get safety where it can be had; For, whether of a low degree or high, To trust to men is trusting to a Lye. I am surprized with another FIT, But what it will produce, I know not yet. Confusedly things tumble in my breast, And if confusedly they be exprest, You must be pleas'd to take them as you find them, (And, as begun, before I had design'd them) Since when few knew what's best for them to do, That will be done which they are forc'd unto; And may perhaps too, have as good success As that with which more freedome I express: (At leastwise) when men's manners, and the times Shall make them heed the Reason of my Rimes; For nothing I'll insist on, but what shall Tend to GOD's glory, and the good of all. Of no mens Persons whosoe're they are, Will I accept, in what I shall declare: (Not of mine own, in any thing that may Wrong Justice, or my Conscience any way) Nor be so fearful, or so over-bold, So over-hot, so luke-warm, or so cold, That any justly shall my words despise, That's honest, sober, generous or wise: But plainly tell things as I finde they are, And then concerning them, my thoughts declare; Not limited by Method like to those Who make expressions of their minds in prose; But by Digressions, as the Muses do, When sudden Raptures them incline thereto; And in such Language as may evidence The truth, without affected Eloquence. Yet, nor the better, nor the worse effect, Whether I write, or write not, I expect As to my Self; save, as I hope to raise Thereby a Ground-work for GOD's future praise From things observ'd; with which work to dispense I dare not, neither can without offence: For GOD is much concern'd in things now done; As also, in what may succeed thereon; And if well known, and well weigh'd, all things were VVhich, to mee petinent at this time are, As with those Lepers who distressed sate 'Twixt VVAR and FAMINE, at Samaria's Gate; So should I seem to fare: for, whether they Continu'd in that place, or went away, Their hazards were the same; and so are mine, VVhether to VVORDS, or Silence, I incline. They at the last resolved were to try That course which they thought best; and so do I. VVhich if no man regards, 'tis but the lot That, I, and better men have often got. Assist, Oh GOD! in what I seek to do; For, when that MAZE I wistly look into Which we are in, I am afraid almost That I in some dark passage may be lost. Our Follies have so wrapt us in a Gin, Composed both of Righteousness and Sin, Of Truth and Falshood, of Non-sense and Reason, Of Good and Ill, of Loyalty and Treason; And disagreeing Judgements and Affections, Have broken us into so many Fractions; Our heads inforcing into such cross Angles, Whereby the Net still more and more intangles, And fastned it with such a snarled knot, That, to unty it, if thou help them not, All humane pow'rs will be imploy'd in vain, To set us at full liberty again. But notwithstanding, here is hardly ought That, is not wholly out of order brought; Yet, if thou list, when likeliest means do fail, Thou canst make things unlikely to prevail. Thy purpose, thou as well to pass canst bring By my Goose-quill, as by an Angels Wing: And, though on all sides all have so misdone That, I am like to give content to none; If I may do thy Will, I shall not care What else, ensues, or who displeased are. Mens Failings, and their Duties being shown, Thy Justice and thy Mercies will bee known. And hoping, to that end, thou guid'st my Pen, I'll without fear, make my Addresse to men. For, doubtless, I may boldly do mine Errant To Kings and Nations, when I have thy warrant. Full eighteen years and one month, very neer Since we began to ring the Changes here Are past away; and since by often turning We, have been broyling, to escape a burning: But, what are we the better, now, unlesse, We shall discover what things were amisse; And when we finde them, seriously intend Our courses, for the future, to amend? For, how can they have ease, who bear about them, And in them, what theyseek to cure without them? Or, to obtain it shall be still so mad, As to expect it, where none can be had? Or, how can possibly that Body be From great Distempers, or Destruction free, Whose Head and Members are from one another Divided? or so cruel to each other As not to let each part, enjoy that dole Which Nature gave them to preserve the WHOLE? Our King's return'd: but we, to him from whom Our perfect Peace, and saving-health must come, Are not as yet return'd; and whilst we are As we now be, things will be as they were. We shall be cheated, if we do suppose Wasps will turn Bees, or Doves proceed from Crows, Till GOD himself, whose proper work it is, Shall bring to passe that Metamorphosis, Which hath been long expected by this Nation, And, will require a longer expectation; Ev'n till we more indeavour it, from him VVho may to us, as to Jerusalem, Cry out, How often have I sought your good, And as a Hen that's careful of her brood, Would fain have brooded you? but, you would not! His Mercies we have sleighted, or forgot: This negligence, (or, I might rather say This wilfulness) hath made us at this day So wretched, that no hope doth now remain But that which quickly may be lost again: For, we do finde, whatever is pretended, That, like Sowre Ale in Summer we are mended; And, that as since we innovated first, At ev'ry Change, the last prov'd alwaies worst. (Whether things were presented to our sight In Habits old or new, in black or white) So still, 'tis like to be, till we adhere To Righteous Actings, with hearts more sincere, By what vow, promise, or fair show soever, The Politician works on his Beleever: Yea, though the King should do the best he can, And act beyond the sphear of mortal man: For, here Herculean labours finde he shall, And, that he's come now to th'Æugæan-stall, Which must be cleansed (as the Poets say That was) by turning Streams another way. I, round about mee, hear a sound of Peace; But I (as yet) discover nothing lesse; Although, I do not see as heretofore Swords drawn; or hear so oft, the Canons roar. That, which some dream we have, I cannot find; Either, I see too much, or they are blinde. I see it possible; and with clos'd eyes See also, how it may be otherwise, Unless both Prince and People joyn as One In doing that, which is yet left undone. We have a King (God prosper him:) but hark! He, hath a people too will finde him work. He may perceive before this year wheels round, That, with a wreath of thorns, they him have crown'd; And, that among their Sweet-meats, taste he shall A little Honey mixed with much Gall. What can the Masters Art, at Helm prevail To save the Ship, that spreadeth every sail Amongst Rocks in a storm, from being sunk, VVhen all his Mariners are sick or drunk? VVhat can the wisest Single person do, Although King Solomon and David too VVere of his Council? Joshua General, Sampson his Champion, and his Life-guard all Like David's Worthies, till men understand Their own estate, heed, what GOD hath in hand; What, he expects, and better can discover VVhat Grace is offer'd, and what Plagues hang over? Or, what can any Nations do, whose Kings And Governours are heedless of such things? These Duties, few of us regarded have, But multipli'd our Feasts; made our selves brave; Neglect, as others did, our day of Trial, And sing unto the Lute, the Harp, or Viol, Ev'n whilst our Brethren sharply punish'd are For sins whereof their Judges are not clear: For I, nor You, nor any one of them, VVho with severity, their faults condemn, Could be excus'd, if GOD should be severe In questioning what hath been acted here. As therefore, GOD shall bring them to my mind To treat of those things I am now inclin'd, VVhereby, Dooms threatened may be turned from These Realms, or born with meekness when they come. But, I will first inform you, by what light I see those things, whereof I have a sight, In hope it will be better, then be known If Truth I write, or Fancies of mine own. Immodestly we must not pry into GOD's secrets: yet, what hee intends to do, He, not alone doth by his Word reveal With what to Sins, to Duties, VVo, or VVeal, Relates: but Medium's also hath bestown VVhereby, some future things may be fore-known; And, hee expects, that we with industry Should to the search of them our selves apply According to that means: because, each thing VVhich Disquisition may to knowledge bring, VVill either hurt or profit, less or more, As (for the most part) it hath been before Sought, shun'd, hop'd, fear'd, and well consider'd on. And that makes mee oft-times to muse upon Things that may be, as well as those that are; And, things past, with things present to compare, That I may know, as much as Reason can, VVith help of Grace, my duties as a man. And, though it be of many disregarded, GOD hath my pains, in that kind, oft rewarded VVith such Discoveries that (if timely heeded) They might have Plagues prevented, that succeeded. VVhereof, lest you still doubt; here I will show By what means I some future things fore-know, That, you may prove, if those which I declare Either Phanatick, or Impostures are. My Muse acts by a Glass of Speculation, VVhereto applying, what my Observation Laies hold on, I do otherwhile fore-see Some things, which either may, or may not be, As that shall be omitted or fulfill'd VVhich is by GOD, conditionally will'd. Enthusiasms, I know, most men contemn; No further therefore, I pretend to them Than POETS may; though in all Generations GOD may, and doth vouchsafe both Revelations And Visions too (for ought yet known to mee) VVhich may to us Premonitory be: Since, frequently, prenotions I have had (By some Impressions on my spirit made) Of what ensu'd, which I could not have known By any Light, or Virtue of mine own. If therefore, you shall be inclin'd unto My way of Divination, then, thus do: VVithdraw your selves to some place all alone, VVhere you shall interrupted be of none: (The VVoods, your Closet, or the fragrant Field, Conveniences for such a purpose yeeld) VVhen you are there, place GOD before your eyes, And, minding he your deeds and thoughts espies. Cast backward, so far from you every thing (As possibly) which an offence may bring To such a Majesty; chiefly those ends VVhose prosecution, neither truly tends Unto GOD's honour or to edifie Your selves or others; but, to vanity; To satiate your Avarice or Pride, Or such like Lusts. Thus, having sanctifi'd Your Persons, place upon the right-hand side GOD's Oracles, by which all things are tri'd. You shall in them, exprest at large, behold All Acts and Sufferings, whieh in times of old Concern'd Him, or his People, with all those To them relating, who were Friends or Foes, So far forth, as to you their cognizance Pertains, and as your VVeal it may advance. These, by GOD's Providence transmitted were To future ages, to be every where, (Ev'n to the very utmost end of Time) That VRIM and that THUMMIM unto them, VVhereto they might repair, when they of ought That needed Resolution, stood in doubt. Therein, you all Occurrences may finde, VVhich necessarily, in any kind, Shall unto Faith or Manners appertain, So long as in this world men do remain. There are exemplifide, all humane failings, All Changes, Hopes, Fears, Losings, and Prevailings, Of Enemies or Friends: Things Good and Evil; The Practices and Projects of the Devil; Things Metaphysical, products of Nature And Grace, with what concerneth ev'ry creature; All Promises and Threatnings, which belong To Faith or Unbeleef, to Right or VVrong, VVith all things else that pertinent may be To ev'ry Faculty, and each Degree, VVhen with this GLASSE, you are acquainted grown So that your Self, may to your self be known; (For, it will shew more plainly than your face You ever, yet beheld in any Glasse VVhat's in your heart; and also let you see What things are wanting, which there ought to be) And, when by practice you enabled are To know to what heads, those things to refer Of which you would enquire, place opposite, What you have by your hearing, or by sight Discovered, to that Subject pertinent, Concerning which, you seek to know th'event, Or good or ill condition of the same, And what you may conjecture without blame. Then, well consider all the Circumstances That qualifie, and all Appurtenances That aggravate, to make men capable Of Mercies, or to Judgements liable; As likewise, all Essentials to that thing Whose Nature, Merit, or demeriting You seek to understand; or else what Meed Or punishment is for the same decreed According to the Rules, and Judged Cases, Recorded in that Map of common places. This being done, be confident (if you have not for Truths received things untrue) By paralleling Objects which you see, Upon your left hand plac'd, with such as be Upon the right, it will to you appear Whether or not approveable they are; And, what on Humane Actions, will ensue Whereof you had an undeceived view; Except an intervening change takes place By secret sins, or unseen Acts of Grace. Nay, otherwhile, it pleaseth Providence To hint things not deducible from thence, Concerning both the manner and the time Of future Consequences, unto them Who seek not out of Vanity or Pride For hidden things; and they are verifi'd Accordingly, when by what's fore-discerned The welfare of GOD's people is concerned. This, meerly, is a work of Contemplation, Not practical without much Observation; And will as harshly sound in most men's ears, As Love-songs, to an aged Usurer's; And, teachable it is not, save to those Whom GOD shall by his Spirit pre-dispose For such a search: but, 'tis attained then Assoon by mean wits, as by wisest men; And, better answers what their Queries are, Than if the Influence of ev'ry Star, With all their Constellations they could know, And, more confirm'd thereby their Faith will grow. Now, what of our Affairs, I pre-conjecture By this GLASSE, I intend to read a Lecture As pertinently, as my shallow wit, And those confused Objects will permit VVhich press as hard within me to come As those Oppressions hemming me about Strive to break in upon me: for 'twixt these My soul and body lye in Little-ease. Oh GOD, thine aid I once again implore, That my Design make not our breaches more, Nor quite compleat my ruine now begun; At least till I thy work have wholly done: For, I am of no Faction, but profess To King and Country with true heartiness, Both Loyalty and Love, with an intent Dustruction and Disunion to prevent, By offering to mens due considerations, Some Objects of my private Observations With those Products, which may arise from thence; And which may likewise have an influence On other things, that will relation have To Thee and thine, whose interests to save I so obliged am, that I would neither Should be dishonour'd, or wrong done to either: And, LORD, as this, my chief design to be, Thou knowest, so vouchsafe to prosper me. Betwixt Mount Gebal and Mount Gerazim, At this day, to be placed, we do seem; And, 'tis yet in suspence, whether or not A Blessing or a Curse will be our lot: The first I hope for, and the last I fear, Considering how still qualifide we are: And what a little change in us is made By all the changes we have lately had. If raging singly, Avarice, Ambition, Self will, Prophaneness, Envy, Superstition, Hypocrisie and Malice we have found Scarce tolerable; what when they abound, And are united, can be here expected, (Or, may be rationally then effected) But multiplied Injuries and Scorn, Not easily expressed, much less born? If here shall be with wicked Canaanites, A mixture of as wicked Israelites, Whose sins will be as many (if not more) And greater, than they have been heretofore, How can our expectations be much better, Than either former punishments, or greater? So bad, so mad, our prosecutions be, (By all that yet appeareth unto mee) As if we wilfully resolv'd had bin Against all spoke without us, or within, Or whatsoe'ere to us Examples teach, Or Conscience, by our hopes or fears doth preach. But, if those Juglings which observed are By mee, should unto ev'ry one appear, All Juglers would unto contempt be brought; They, who seem very wise, would fools be thought, And many in themselves grow doubtful whether They to be pitied were, or scorned rather. As great, as many, are the wrongs, the crimes, The cruelties and falshoods of these times, As ever; and will such continue still, Till Truth and Errour, and till Good and Ill, Have plaid their Masters-prize; to which intent Their forces universally are bent Against each other. From false hearts proceeds Falshood in words, and wickedness in deeds; And whilst we talk of Righteousness and Peace, They, who concealed their maliciousness VVith fair deportments do anew begin So to declare what they have alwaies bin, As makes, in many, inlets to some fear, That, till it endeth in a Massacre, No Vengeance will their projects terminate, Or set a lasting period to their hate. A bloodless Massacre here is already Begun among us, and it will be bloody VVhen you perceive admittance of those Strangers, VVho first begun our plagues, renew our dangers; And then, they who suppos'd their persons free, VVill with the rest, in equal perils be: For, boundless lustings, mischiefs will beget, VVhich lye within the womb unheeded yet, Where Sin and Death are twins conceiv'd together Though born a little while before each other; And, will in very ugly shapes be found In many places, ere this year goes round; Portended, and attended in strange wise, VVith Omnious Events, and Prodigies. Wee shall see Gown-men tread on Men of VVar, High Courts of Justice called to the Bar; Those, of whom no man lately stood in dread, Arraign the Living, and condemn the Dead: Make Martyrs, Saints and Reprobates of those VVhose good or bad condition no man knows; And act such things as never yet were done VVithin this Clymate since the world begun. Yet, heed this, you, who with a sober mind Seek peace, and are not factiously inclin'd, (And you, whose principle is to repair VVhat is decay'd, with no worse Tools than prayer) VVith Chrstian patience bear the Visitation VVhich is allotted to this Generation; And know, that as now Nature runs the race By her designed, so shall also Grace Pursue her course, to purge us in these fires, For that perfection whereto Faith aspires. Strive by renewing of your self-denials, To bear with constancy your fiery trials, Which must be undergone: for they appear In shew more painful than in proof they are; As their experience found, who in times past Have into Babels Fornaces been cast, When they were seven times heated; and as wee May peradventure find, ere long 'twill be. Be not afraid of your own sins; for they On your repentance will be done away: Nor be discouraged, though your Foes at large Shall sum them up, and lay unto your charge False imputations also: for, with ease Both Saints and Reprobates of whom they please The Vulgar make: and, if prophane men shall Be Judges betwixt David and King Saul, The sins of David might be made appear As many and much greater than Sauls were; And He, upon whose side GOD sentence gave, Amongst most men, the least esteem would have. But, GOD observ'd his heart; purg'd what did flow From humane frailty, as he purgeth now VVith sharp corrections, the late crying crimes Of Saints prevaricating in these times. Judgement, in our days, at GOD's house begins, Who takes such notice of our many sins, That since we would not mend when we were chidden; He will no longer now let them be hidden Or go unpunish'd: but we, that each other Provok'd to sin, shall punish one another. Me blame not then, if I touch here and there, Those failings on all sides which causes were Of what we suffer: for, GOD will be known By doing Justice; and we ought to own Our great Transgressions, and not seek to hide Those Crimes, for which he lays ev'n Kings aside, As well as other men; that all may know He giveth equal dooms to high and low. Though, therefore, we sometimes a vail may cast O'er faulty Rulers, whilst their pow'r doth last, To keep them from contempt, lest their disgrace May cause infringement of the Common Peace, VVe must not counter-act what GOD will do, VVhen he reproves them, and removes them too: But, suff'ring with them by commiseration, As being worthy of like condemnation, Give GOD the glory, with our Pens and Breath, For what's intended by their shame or death. A sickness which is Epidemical (In some degree) hath seized upon all, And, ease we cannot have, till that hath wrought VVhich to procure a remedy is brought. VVhen Cures are to distempers first appli'd, VVe must expect, more torments to abide Than if we felt our Maladies alone, VVithout a Medicine working thereupon. Of our malignant humours to be eas'd, To take some poys'nous Drugs we must be pleas'd; For, our Physician, who doth truly know Their and our Natures, hath prescribed so. Diseases otherwhile need letting bloud, Though with what is corrupt, that which is good Seems also lost: Gangrenes require sometimes To save the Whole, by cutting off of Limbs. Yea, otherwhile a welfare doth redound In common, when that suffers which is sound; And, once when sick to death the Body lay, 'Twas cur'd by taking of the Head away. GOD, who of evil things can make good uses, And, by what is unwholsome, Health produces, Vouchsafeth to make passage now and then, To signal blessings, by the sins of men; As when the sons of Jacob, who inslaved Their Brother, were thereby, from Famine saved. VVhich teacheth us, to be contented still To let him act, both when and how he will; To search into our own corruptions nearly, And not to censure any too severely. Since unto every one it may be known, That, no mans fault, so harms as his own: Let over-bitter Censures be suspended, When you perceive a Brother hath offended By rashness, or through frailty, (though in that VVhich to our Common VVelfare doth relate) Spare not the sin a jot, but spare the man (Who'er) as much as possibly you can, Till some Concomitancies or th'Event Assures that malice was in his intent: And, though that may appear, assume not then, A pow'r to judge, belonging not to men: Because, for ought you know, God might bereave him, Of counsel, or unto himself then leave him, For our Transgressions past; and to let in A publick mercy, by his private sin; Thereby to humble us, and make us know That all our VVeal from his meer Grace doth flow; And, that the sins of others to our peace As helpful were, as our own Righteousness. In former times and causes, it was so, The Ægyptian Mid-wives, Rahab, Jael too, Did things which in their nature sinful are, Yet not alone by GOD made useful were To save his people, but he also saith, That ev'n those actions were products of Faith. And, in these times perhaps here have been such, Whereon, if I with modesty shall touch, Let me be blameless; for, with good intent VVhat GOD permits for our experiment, I here will mention, and to make it known, That there is nothing meerly of our own, Or which is in us either good or evil, By Nature or suggestions of the Devil, That stops or furthers ought which GOD will do, Though our concurrence he requires thereto So far, as with his Will he us acquaints, Or, bounds, by unresistable restraints: For, when we are enjoyn'd to that or this, It is for our advantage, not for his, Of us requir'd; yea though we bounded be By Precepts, Rules or Laws, so is not he. As he himself shall please he can effect His Ends, whatere we do, or shall neglect; And, when against us any Foe prevails, It is because we, not because he fails. In all our late contests, 'tis hard to say, Wether our Vice or Vertues made best way To that Design, whereby to pass were brought Those, which our best Atchievments have been thought; Or, whether led by Folly or sound Reason By Fraud or Force, by Faithfulness or Treason We prospered most: and 'tis not yet agreed By all men, who our persecutions heed, Whether that which befell us at the first, Or at the last, will prove the best or worst. The Louse or Lion, Black Dogs, or the White, Most mischievously either fawn or bite; Which Party most needs pardon for their Sin, Upon which side there hath most Traytors been; Or, whether their Deserts are worst or best VVho shall be honour'd most, or most disgrac't; For, though we know what Causes men did own, With what heart they did act them, 'tis unknown. Prodigious Fruits in these times have been born; Crabs on the Vine, and Grapes upon the Thorn; And, Men and Causes, whether good or bad, Of Weal and Woe, by turns, like shares have had, To teach, that our late Changes have succeeded For some ends, which ought better to be heeded. By one Irregularity, we see That, here in two months more progressions be In order to the Temporary peace VVhich most men are desirous to possess, Then all our Pow'rs and Vertues, Wit and Cost Had brought to pass, in twenty years almost; And we according to late promisings, See creeping Motions toward some such things As are expected: but, they to and fro, Forward and backward, in their motion go So doubtfully, that 'tis as yet uncertain What Resolutions are behind the Curtain. As doubtful 'tis, whether more praise or blame To them belong, who first contriv'd the same; Whether the Consequence, or that which first Thereto made passage, will prove best or worst; And whether want of pre-conditioning Will bring at length, most damage to the King And his Old Party, or else unto those VVho did his Entrance heretofere oppose: For Acts unjust, are oft well carried on, And many righteous things unjustly done: Some things likewise there be resembling Sand, VVhich he that graspeth with an open hand, May therewith lode his palm: but, if he gripe Too hard, 'twill all between his fingers slip. Concerning that proceed, which brought to pass The Change, which lately here effected was, Some scruplings have been made: But, on the Fact, Or upon them who put the same in Act, I'll nothing peremptorily declare, Though therein, an Obliquity there were; Because, means fail'd me, whereby to inspect, Ought further, than into the single Act; That, by the Circumstances I might see What Motives to their hearts propos'd might be; VVhat Spirit led them, and what streights they past To that, which was resolved on at last: For, in such Cases, what they ought to do, Wise men are oft to seek, and good men too. If they who were chief Instruments in that VVhich wrought the Change, that we have seen of late, Sought only and unfeignedly that end, VVhereto all Trusts and Actions ought to tend, And were but Circumstantially to blame, In plotting or pursuing of the same, Their fault (if any) is a Venial Crime, For which there may be made another time Amends to Sufferers; that perhaps may more Secure them, than they were secur'd before. Their Fault was but an errour of a man, VVhich well the King may pardon: for, I can; Because, I know, what ere they did intend, GOD will have glory by it, in the end; And, all these Nations future welfare too, If they neglect not, what is yet to do. But, they whose Trust, these Trustees did abuse Them, cannot peradventure so excuse; And (I beleeve) more wise than heretofore, VVill henceforth never trust Good Fellow more; Nor Peasant, Peer, Priest, Prince, or Parliament, VVith that which may produce a Detriment To common Int'rest (till by some condition To them secur'd, they shall secure fruition Of such Concernments) if, once more they may Recover that which they did fool away. But, that's impossible, as things now stand; And, should GOD take the pow'r out of his hand Who grasps it now, they who shall next enjoy it, No better peradventure would employ it Than others did. GOD therefore, keeps us from Another Change, until his Kingdom come, Except a change of hearts; and at this time, Of his probation, let his Grace, in him Be so effectual, that he may endeavour To settle here, a righteous throne for ever. For, ev'ry man that lives (at first or last) Before a Final Doom on him is past, Hath in his life-time, once (at least) an hour VVherein our gracious God, vouchsafes him pow'r To ask and have; and to elect that path VVhich leads to weal or wo, to life or death: Yea, always at such times, GOD, who first loves, The soul of ev'ry humane-creature proves; And, those, who then, by giving him their heart, (Though with much failing) do perform their part, He will enable, and assist them still By his preventing Grace, to do his will. For they, as often as they go astray, Shall either hear a VOICE within them say, (Or else behind them;) Of that course beware; Return, or thou art lost; thy way lies there, Which leads to safety. Thus the Spirit preacheth, And by means extraordinary teacheth Where common means fail: and till men contemn His Holy Spirit, God forsakes not them: But, afterward, indeed, although the same He sometimes speaks, 'tis to increase their shame, Or others to instruct: for, then such Voices Are so drown'd by the Whisperings and Noises Of carnal things, that all is spoke in vain, Which to their weal or safety may pertain. The King by such temptations, and so many Beleagur'd seems, as never were by any With constancy and without foil withstood, Save by him, who was GOD with flesh and bloud: For, he stands now expos'd to ev'ry evil, (Ev'n in the Front) whereby World, Flesh, or Devil, May him assault; and with him 'twill go hard, Unless, GOD sends him in, an Angel-guard; Which (if it be his pleasure) that he may, My heart unfeignedly doth often pray; And that, at this time, he submit his will, The mind of God, sincerely to fulfil: For, I beleeve, that as it did with Saul, (On his probation-day, long since befall) These Kingdoms will establish'd be to him, As he with GOD complyeth at this time. Fair Opportunities this present day Are offer'd, which if he let slip away, We have but hitherto a course begun, Whereby we may at last be more undone: And though he should become ten times as strong In things which to a carnal strength belong, It will to settle him prevayl no more Than such pow'rs have prevailed heretofore: Nor will it, when most mighty he appears To others, from his own heart, keep out fears Of things not to be feared; but at length Make him, perhaps, afraid of his own strength: And that which by a Trifle hath been lost, VVill be recover'd with as little cost As when 'twas won, assoon as their despight, Their sins and insolencies are at height, VVho shall by petulant exasperations, (Beyond the common patience of these Nations) Abuse his Grace, and turn their late success Into oppression, pride, and wantonness. This, seems by some endeavour'd (having ends Repugnant untowhat the King intends) Who do proceed (as if that for the nonce) To make all Suff'rers desperate at once, By gelding and delaying of the Grace, For which the King spontaneously did pass His Royal Word: And, this may an Event Produce, at last, whereof some will repent When 'tis too late; since Mastives brook it worse To be o're-much provokt, then Fawning Curs. All vengeance doth to GOD alone belong: But, few remember this, when they have wrong. An English temper doth that life disdain VVhich is depriv'd of what should Life maintain: And whatso'er is menaced or follows, Some, in despight of Hang-man, Rope and Gallows, VVill any thing attempt, to vindicate Themselves from scorn when rob'd of their Estate: And they have little prudence, who conceive Bees will be quiet, when both from their Hive And Honey they are forc'd: or, that small things (VVhen they are many, and have many stings) Are safely slighted; for, there hath succeeded Much mischief where this Caution was unheeded: And probable it seems, that if the King Defers what's hop'd for, now, but till next Spring, Destroying many thousand Families By vacating their just Securities, (For what was bought or lent, to save these Lands From desolation, when into their hands The Supreme pow'r did slip by GOD's permission, VVho then had cast him out of his possessions) It will not be the next way to that peace VVhich many yet are hopeful to possess; Or have a consequent, to answer that Great Mercy, which GOD hath vouchsaf'd of late. If, for performing that which both Divine, And Humane Laws did warrant and enjoyn, (To wit, obedience to those Pow'rs that were In being) he from Innocents doth tear Their Livelihoods; and their posterity Exposeth unto scorn and beggery, For having done their duties unto them VVhom GOD advanced by debasing him, (And when he so unable was to give them Protection, or from their hand to reprieve them, That at the same time, he himself was glad To seek a Refuge where it might be had) It will not seem to be an Act of Grace, That corresponds with what expected was Before Monck gave us up into his power; And made our Trustees much more his, than our. If he shall lay an over-heavy weight On those, whom he had left in such a streight, VVithout their fault (except a fault it were To lose, what they to keep unable were) Or, if he shall, as other men have done, Lose those Advantages that he hath won By Angling for a Frog till from his Net The Fishes now inclosed forth shall get; Young Counsellors may prove to him as bad As those which foolish Rehoboam had. But, this is more than probable (altho The Priests and Prophets dare not tell him so, VVho now most fawn upon him) that, even all GOD's Condescentions are conditional; And, that now or hereafter, their success VVill to his weal or woe add more or less, Accordingly as he, and as these Nations Improve at this day, His and their Probations. VVhich Truth most men beleeve not, or forget; And, that makes mee so often mention it. GOD gave unto his people, on conditions, The Land of Promise, to be their possessions; And, for their not performing of the same, They Vagabonds throughout the world became. Upon conditions also, Solomon Had promise of an everlasting Throne: VVhich he neglecting, ere the third descent, Ten parts of twelve were from his Kingdome rent. Yea, wicked Jeroboam might have had A settlement on him for ever made, Upon the like conditions: and, so may This King; but never any other way. If he comes hither with the self-same heart, VVith which, he did, in likelihood depart; New cover'd over with a fairer skin, And fully fraughted with Revenge within: If he shall make his Royal Word a snare, If he by hopes delayed nourish fear In stead of love; by mental Reservations, (Or by deceiveable Equivocations) His promise vacates; or, if what he swore In presence of his Sov'raign heretofore; Or, if he shall confine to other brests These Acts of Grace, which to his Interests Will most advantage give, when it is known The pardons which he granteth are his own: If he refers his Justice to their Zeal Who may prefer their Ends before his Weal, Until it shall unhappily destroy That new-sprung hope which many yet enjoy; And by converting it into despair, Blasts that in Autumn, whereof blowings fair Appear this Spring; we may thereby perchance, Ere many Springs compelled be to dance Another Matachin. If, GOD so please, I wish and pray it may be otherwise; And that this might be weigh'd: for, on this BALL None are so firmly fixt, but they may fall If Righteousness and Truth support them not, What other prop soever they have got. We have a sight of this days joy and sorrow, But no man knows what will befall to morrow: And should GOD be as rigorous as men, That which is done, would be undone agen. I do beleeve, that (not excepting any) All men of great Offences, and of many Are guilty. And, I do suppose the King Hath not been free from blame in every thing. To him there may, either by men, or heaven, Be somewhat on the scores, to be forgiven As well as to the People: secret crimes May be in former, or in latter times Committed, wherein either he misdid, Or his Progenitors, which yet are hid, And must be expiated, ere that Rest Whereat we aym, will fully be possest; And have an Expiation by meer Grace, Or by that pennance through which others pass. In order whereunto, GOD now perchance Him, to his Fathers Throne doth re-advance; Either a new progression to begin, Or else to fill the measure of their sin; And punish us, till ripen'd, he, or we, Or both, for Grace, or for Destruction be. If penitence allay not that fierce wrath, Whereto our wickedness provok'd him hath, There will impartial search be made, by GOD, As well for common, as for Royal bloud; Yea, search on both sides, both for bloud and treason, When equal Retributions are in season: And, as much guiltiness if he shall then In Kings discover, as in common men, Their Judges vindicate from guilt he shall, Though them we murtherers and traytors call; And, their bloud, if it guiltlesly be shed, Will cry as loud to GOD as Abels did. What will it profit then, if there be none To question them on earth: for ought misdone, When they shall know, and truly understand, On what sad terms, they fall into GOD's hand; Who shall the more offend, because they were More by him priviledg'd than others are? GOD will not then be mockt, whatever they Shall dream, who put the thought thereof away; Or whatso'er a Prophet in Lawn Sleeves Of Kings and their Immunities believes: And though their Nobles also flatter them, As Judahs did King Joash, in his time. Hereof I would be his Remembrancer, If in the place of some of those I were VVho ought to do it: yea, as now I am, I had adventur'd to perform the same, But that I lately have conceiv'd a thought, These Lines will timely to his view be brought, By such a hand, as from it with respect It may be taken, and have good effect. And, if these Cautions he shall not contemn, (Expressed in true Loyalty to him) I may have hope, that Justice to obtain VVhich I have elsewhere sought long time in vain; And finde it to be made a real sign Of his, and publick peace, as well as mine. For, all I shall expect will be no more But, that, he make me neither rich nor poor; And mee within that Grace would comprehend, VVhich he to some of those doth yet extend, VVho both by their Examples and Command First drew mee with his Opposites to stand; And who, if I mis-acted, did thereby Contract ten times a greater guilt than I. But, so the publick peace advanc'd may be Hereby, let what GOD will befall to mee. To make their merits and demerits even, They should love much, to whom much is forgiven: Yet, some to whom he hath forgiven least, May love as well as they who love him best; And, better too perhaps, when they behold Hee executes that Jnstice which he should; With constancy pursuing, what, more tends To publick Welfare, than to serve his ends. How these things may concern him, he best knows Next GOD, who will (I hope) his heart dispose To chuse the way proposed at this time, And to pursue the same, enable him. Because, unless at this time, that probation For which GOD hath vouchsaf'd his Restoration, Produceth what with those ends may accord, For which he was by Providence restor'd, He'll turn the Wheel, which hath so oft gone round, Till men according to his heart be found To rule his People; to direct his Sheep; To act his Will, and their own Vows to keep. Herein hath been much failing: and, I fear, Ev'n for that Covenants breach, which many jeer, And impudently sleight, GOD from this Land Will not remove his now correcting hand, Till a true repentance he shall bring For that sin, People, Parliament and King. A Judgement at this present is begun, Which will extend to all ere it be done; Ev'n unto those who execute his doom On them, on whom it has already come; (Yea, signally, in some respect or other, To persons or estates, to friend or brother) If they whom it concerns do not amend What is misdone; wave, what they mis-intend; And hearken to GOD's Voice in this their day Of Tryal; and as (if they will) they may: For GOD though much provokt, still giveth space Twixt ev'ry Judgement, for preventing-grace: And now, to be a Cautional to him, (As his Corrections lately were to them Who reigned last) this King, shal see them scourg'd VVho scourged him, until their sins be purg'd, God having cast his Predecessors out, For their, and also for our sins (no doubt) Them, with an Iron Rod begins to strike; To shew, that sin he hates in all alike, And make it known that he will no man spare, (Though one of his own Houshold he appear) If he shall scandalously give offence In any kind, without true penitence. A dreadful Judgement he hath brought on those, VVho made of Piety, the fairest shows; And they, as traytors to their King, are now By those pursued, whom they did pursue As traytors to their Country; and their Laws, Yea their own Swords, turn Foes unto their Cause: And they who lately, nor to friend nor foe, But for by-ends, would either Justice do, Or Mercy show, shall find in their distress, That others will to them be merciless. They, who were called Saints; and may be such, Although their fayling hath been very much; Seem now the chief mark of GOD's indignation, And censur'd are as sons of Reprobation; Because, they often had fore-warned been, (Twice were cast out of grace, and twice took in) Are now depriv'd, a third time, of that pow'r VVhich they abus'd to their own harm and our: They are expos'd to such extream disgraces, Such hazards of their goods, lands, lives and places, And to such scorns, that, never was there more Contempt cast upon any heretofore: For, they, who as their Chiefs acknowledg'd them (To their own shame) their persons did contemn; And, far beyond all presidents, revile Th'Authority they owned, ev'n the while It was in being; though they did in that Make, as it were a Close-stool of their Hat. Of all esteem, they are now quite bereft, And, in so sad a plight have thousands left, Who trusted them with ev'ry thing they had, That their own selves alone, they have not made Thereby contemptible to Foes and Friends, (Lost their estates, their safeties, and their ends) And such confusions brought, that few or none Are sure, they shall not thereby bee undone, Or Damnified; but given cause likewise To this, and times to come, so to despise An English Parliament, that, if it get No better credit than it hath, as yet, It is in hazard to become a thing As much abhorred, as the name of King Was once in Rome; for their prevarications, Their self-ends, falshoods, and dissimulations With King and People so destructive were, And both to Round-head and to Cavalier (As then distinguished) that, if there be any, Few names are left, whereof there be not many Undone, at at least damnified, either In credit or estate, or both together: And, by those many thousands now undone, That mischief, so, from man, to man, doth run, That it infects three times as many more, And may bring beggery to ev'ry door, Besides, those quarrels which it may beget, Whose sad effects lye unperceived yet. Some, who had been most faithful to their side, They much opprest whilst they were dignifi'd; And, often when they did pretend a course To cure their Grievances, they made them worse. Then, what by such oppressed men from those Can look't for be, whom they pursu'd as foes, But to be kikt out of the world, or trod Into the dirt? Except, our gracious GOD Hath now brought home the King to be a friend To all men who did honestly intend? And who, though in some things they did amisse, Sin'd not with malice, or with wilfulness? The Kings work will be now, both to relieve And to correct, as cause, he shall perceive, Without respect to persons, or wrongs done, Before a Reconcilement was begun; Except so far forth onely, in relieving, In recompencing, honouring, or giving, As he's to those men, who with him ingaged In charity, and gratitude obliged, Without destroying any in these Nations VVho were submissive to GOD's Dispensations; And, who, were mov'd to that which they have done By Conscience, or by Ignorance alone, VVithout malicious purpose or design, Against a known Law, Moral or Divine. And therefore, where respect is to be had To suff'rers, and to satisfaction made; The best expedient to prevent debates, And ruining of many mens estates, VVill either be, if we had such Trustees, VVho by this change, life nor estates do leese, (And by confederating long together VVith publick spoils inriched one another, Or may be proved guilty of a Cheat, Which formerly did friend or foe defeat Of his estate; or, to the publick wrong More power assum'd, than did to them belong) To cause, that, they to whom these gave offence, May out of their estates have recompence; For, why should great Revenues be enjoy'd By them, whose guilt hath guiltless men destroy'd? Or rather, since that many among these Were intermixt (who their miscarriages Opposed to their power) whom none knows how From persons guilty, to distinguish now: Why should not for the Credit of the Nation, (For Justice sake) and for the preservation Of common peace, all parties help to bear Their heavy burthens who oppressed are? For, ev'ry man among us, more or less, Is some way of guilty of this wickedness: And GOD, if this course long defer wee shall, His Vengeance will divide among us all. Let therefore none, who in these suffering times Shall scape the punishments due to their crimes, Insult o'er them that suffer, or suppose Their prosp'ring from their well-deserving flows. Let them remember, and consider well, That they on whom the Tower of Silo fell, No greater sinners judged were than they On whom it fell not; and think at this day Some men may perish, who have been more free From guiltiness, than most that saved be. The King, together with his Parliament, May pardon every kinde of punishment For faults against themselves; or any one, Except for what is wilfully misdone Against our Maker: but, nor he nor they, Can take the guilt of any sin away; And though hee may connive at some offences, Or be deceiv'd as to mens innocencies, Who by their cunning have found means of late Themselves with him to re-indintegrate: Yet, thousands know so well what they have done, And felt so much of what ensu'd thereon, That, though in charity, they do forgive Their falshood, they'l remember't whilst they live. Let them remember too, what they have done, Lest GOD bring Vengeance when we call for none, Can any Peer or Commoner suppose, Who, in the supream Council, sate with those Who did the late unhappy war begin, And by their Declarations drew us in, (As men oblig'd in duty, to adhere To them, in what they prosecuting were) That, they are guiltless, though now blamed lesse Than others, who the same Cause did professe? Can they be blamelesse, who did with the first Begin the Quarrel, and till nigh at worst Continue it; not leaving on Record Ought, whereby their dissent might be declar'd? Nor sought for them, a saving, or protection, Who might be ruined by their defection? Doth it not greatly their crime aggravate, That they vouchsaf'd not to capitulate, That, Innocents, by their default abus'd, Might to some safe condition be reduc'd? But rather, to their own designs made way, By leaving them, to be the Spoilers prey? Though they forgot us, I suppose it fit To mind them; lest themselves they may forget When I am dead; and, therefore, I will here Leave somewhat to be their Remembrancer. Let them remember with consideration, With true repentance, and with due compassion, How many thousands (whilst they live at rest) Are either quite destroyed, or opprest, Either in Person, Credit, or Estate, Whose aid they did not onely oft intreat, But also (thereby to promote their end) Compelled to contribute, pay and lend; Yea, to engage their Persons in their Cause, Under pretence of Piety and Laws, Whom they have now made innocently poor, And forc'd to beg, or else to suffer more; Whilst they from all those miseries are clear, VVhereof their failings chief occasion were: Not onely, making that an Instrument To ruine them, which ruine should prevent; But also (probably) by their endeavour, To make, and keep the people Slaves, for ever. To write plain Truth, why should I bee afraid? By what man may it not be justly said, Our publick faith hath been the shamless'st Debter, And throughout all these Realms the greatest Cheater That ever was; and that our Parliaments Have been beyond all former Presidents: The worst Security (and never more VVill be confided in, as heretofore) If unconfirm'd they leave what hath been bought, And, what was justly sold (as then 'twas thought?) Or, if they make not recompence at least To those, who by their actings are opprest? For this is the same Nation, though the Cause The Governour, and in some part the Laws Are changed now; GOD, who the wrong doth see, Is yet the same, the same will alwaies be, And both for what is suffered, and was done, VVill prosecute the Judgement that's begun. By meer Cheats, many thousand Families Destroyed are, and with complaints and cryes, So fill mens ears, that they make all to grieve, Save those, who sense of no Afflictions have But of their own. The Children, do bemoan Their Aged Parents helplesly undone; VVho, now have nothing left of what was theirs To recompence their pitty, but sad tears: And, he, who thinks Life a gratuity In such a case, loves Life much more than I. Supposing that's a Mercy, which to mee, A barb'rous cruelty, appears to be. Oh God! how are thy kindnesses requited? How in our suff'rings are our foes delighted? How justly dost thou many now condemn, And punish, for wrongs done to some of them? How are the Just and Unjust, wrapt together In one Snare, to torment and plague each other? It is beleev'd, that many men there were VVhen Innovations, were beginning here, VVho, being in themselves malevolent, (And for some private causes discontent) Design'd and practis'd, how to bring to pass That, which their own, and our Destruction was: But, here were many moe, who did indeavour To qualifie the late infectious Fever VVhich had distemper'd us; and to retain The Loyality that seems renew'd again: Yet, now an Epidemical Disease Hath brought Confusion upon some of these As well as upon them, who sin'd perchance Much more through wilfulnesse, then ignorance. They, who did neither by their deeds or words, By counsel, by their pens, or by their swords, Begin those Innovations in the state, VVhich have been prosecuted here of late; No, nor so much as by a secret thought, Contribute to those Changes which were brought Upon these Islands, till they were effected By other men: they, whom themselves subjected Either but passively, to those in power, To scape those mischiefs which might them devour; Or, meerely actively, to help prevent An Anarchy, and Evils imminent; (Which is no more then God's law doth command, VVhen he makes alterations in a Land; And hath been also, practis'd by all Nations In every Kingdom, through all Generations, VVhen either by his grace, or his permission, He brings a poople into our Condition. Ev'n they who did no more, are made to share VVith those, who wilfully transgressors were, And Murtherers, and Traytors be reputed; As if the Kingdom, which was constituted Before these Changes had continued on, And all which hath by God and men been done, VVere but a Dream, of which, now they awake, Men may at will, Interpretations make: Or, as if Actings, in a time of War, Were bounded, as in times of Peace they are: VVhereas tis known, that, War doth silence all Laws, either Civil or Municipal: And, that, what then Necessity constrain'd, May by the Law of Nations be maintain'd, As justly, as those contracts which are made In times of peace by Laws which then we had; Though they, perhaps, who shall have pow'r to do What they themselves please, will not have it so. But, though we got not that, whereat we aim, We thereto will continue still our Claim, And plead our cause; in hope, that truth and reason May at this present, be declar'd in season. If prudent men collect, and weigh the matters Which here my Muse confusedly now scatters, (Because at once within me I retain More Notions, then by words I can make plain) They may by them, if put together well And duly heeded, my true meaning spell. They, who with no side factiously, took part, And onely, in sincerity of heart, Came to secure the Soveraign Magistrate, VVhen call'd by those, who were co-ordinate, VVith him in pow'r: they, who had no intent To make a breach 'twixt King and Parliament, But, faithfully did serve them both together, To have preserved their lawful Rights to either, And cannot be by conscience law or reason; Delinquents any way (much less for Treason) Against their Prince, for giving aid to those VVhom he himself authoriz'd to be chose For his chief Councell, and whom likewise, he Made everlasting Senators to be, Impowr'd to make Laws everlasting too, Until their own Act should themselves undo: They, who did those obey, whom to withstand, (although made active by the Kings command) Hath punish't been with Death; ev'n some of these Though acting also, with good Consciences, For this Obedience, suffer'd with the first, And may have also Lots amongst the worst On both sides; which to me appears, at least Injustice, or no Mercy, at the best. GOD may correct us thus, and justly too, Though to our King and Countrey we have true Continued in the Main: for, in his sight There are demerits in the most upright, VVhich needs the Rod; and he chastises those Whom he befriended, by their greatest Foes; Because, not seldome times they gave to them VVho were his Foes, occasions to blaspheme; His grace and his long-sufferings much abus'd His timely Premonitions oft refuse For, very oft, and very many wayes They had Fore-warnings, of what in these dayes Is brought upon them; and, as many times As GOD forgave them, they renew'd their Crimes. VVhen therefore they had long) without disregard, GOD's messengers in ordinary heard; VVhen, such as they themselves did most esteem, And those who preacht in season unto them Upon their solemne Fasts, or feasting-days, They only thankt, but follow'd on their ways. Then, (as he doth, at first, with Infidels,) By signes prodigious, and by miracles, He proved them: but, Pagans heretofore Have by that means, been wrought upon much more To warn them, and reprove them, he sent, then A company of despicable men, VVho, though despis'd and houted at, they are, (And to the greatest number do appear Phanaticks) were the messengers of God, And such, as he found fit to send abroad To such a People, and at such a season As this, wherein, Rime works as much as Reason; And manifests, 'tis such a time with us, As when GOD's Prophets seem'd ridiculous Unto the Jews, by acting before them Such Signs, as made them more their words contemn. Among such llke, he hath permitted me, Not only their Premonitor to be, But, likewise, to see, what I fore-exprest Fulfill'd; and hear it, by themselves confest: For, I took once, or oftner, ev'ry year, Occasion to be their Remembrancer; And, publickly declared what I knew To be misdone, and what things would ensue If not prevented but most did deride My timely Cautions: Vanity and Pride, Made ineffectual all my pains to be, And, not a little mischievous to me. Yet, still I persevered in declaring What they were doing, and GOD was preparing. Now fourteen years ago, with small regard, My English Opobalsamum declar'd, What would befall them; and, there, is recorded Among such like Expressions, one, thus worded, Opobalsamum Anglicanum, Page 20. ?Which side soever shall prevail, We have a mischief setling by entail On us, and on our heirs: For, in heart You do unite (though corporally apart) And joyn by close Compliances in one, In hope to compass what you have begun, Which is nor worse nor better, but to raise Your houses, both by good and evil waies: And for that end, to ruine you would bring Law, Gospel, People, Parliament and King, But ere this hope effected you shall see, Hark, Traytors, what your destiny shall be, Heed and observe it; for it is the Doom, VVill, will without all peradventure come Upon your heads, who have your trust betray'd, Oppressions on your faithfull Servants laid; And multiplied your wealth with greedinesse; By preying on your Country in distresse. And, this it is; He, that such wrongs requites, Will give you portions among Hypocrites. Your Pride shall suddenly by shame be follow'd; You shall spew up the Gobbets you have swallow'd; Your way shall perish, &amp;c. Unto that book, wherein this is exprest, I will refer you to peruse the rest. The preface to my SALT on SALT, records A Hint to that end, in these following words. Last year I sent a Flash which is let passe Unheeded, as a thing that never was; Now follows the Report, or, Clap of Thunder Which have been seen and heard, thus far a sunder, To give the longer Warning: for, the Shot, And Thunderbolts (if Grace prevent it not) VVill next year flee among you. God, amend us; And then I am assur'd, he will defend us. Moreover, I, ten months, now past, foretold That, nine months longer if defer they should Their Duties, and neglect the Grace twice shown, They, and their projects will be overthrown, As now they are; and that they should be in That Purgatory which doth now begin. The premonition published last year To that effect, shall be repeated here. See Fpistolium Vagum-prosa-metricum Page 20 Let them remember, he that stands may fall, That ev'ry promise is conditional; And, that God's promises will be to them Perform'd, as they to others and to Him Perform their promises: for, though a wrong He oft forgiveth, and forbeareth long, There is a set time, which now draweth near, VVherein, he will no longer so forbear. Let no man slight this Caution, though by him Divulged, who may despicable seem: For in these days, it often comes to passe, That God speaks (as to Balaam by his Asse) To Wisest men, by those whom fools they deem; To Kings, by persons that ignoble seem; And, if their VVills, as wilfully as he They still pursue, like his their ends will be. This Pow'r now ruling, reigns by God's Commission; Yet, not without a fore-premis'd condition: For, by Uunrighteousness it shall not stand, Though it were as the Signet on his hand. If they themselves with outward washings flatter, And, shall not cleanse the inside of the platter: If those Defects of Justice and Compassion Which lately brought confusion on this Nation, Be not forthwith repair'd in some degree, (As means by God's Grace will vouchsafed be) And if a Model truely genuine, This August sixteen hundred fifty nine, Be not conceiv'd, and fully born, before The time exceeds the end of nine months more, VVith all the essential parts of such a thing As may receive a timely perfecting To qualifie the rage that will encrease The breaches made into the Common Peace; Then all that this pow'r thenceforth can endevour, Will either be a Nullity for ever, Or else, a furth'rance to that horrid pother Which will make facile entrance for another Oppressing Hand, that, will but Justice do So far, as Vengeance doth extend unto. But least you think it was by Accident That this presage hath had a Consequent Just at the time foretold, the same book shew'd, In what mode also, that which hath insued Should visit them: heed therefore, and compare What's now begun, with what these Lines declare. In the Book last mentioned, Page 24. To cure those Frenzies, for his future glory, GOD is preparing a New Purgatory To purge what may be purged from the drosse, That of the pure Gold there may be no losse; The Judgements now beginning shall go round, And through these Islands, till all those are found Who have been false in that which they profest To GOD, or to the publick interest. From house to house, from man to man, they shall, Procession make, till they have seiz'd on all, All shall be proved, whether poor they be, Or rich, or of a high or low degree, By outward, or by inward fiery Trials, Till they are brought to real Self-denials. 'Twixt GOD and them, through Mercy to repent Their Failings, or to outward punishment. Those, wha shall in this Island scape his hand, Vengeance will seize on, in a Forreign Land; The foes of Peace among the common Rout, A Pestilence or Famine shall finde out: They who have shuffled from the Souldiers fury, Shall fall into the mercy of a Jury; And, when they from the sword are in some hope To scape, shall then be hampered in a Rope. The Mischiefs which they shunned in the Street, Within a secret Chamber they shall meet. Those men whom nothing publickly pursues, Their Consciences in private shall accuse. They, who immoveably do think to stand, Shall fall without the motion of a hand; And when the things they fear'd cannot annoy them. That, which they sleight, and fear'd not, shall destroy them. I told them likewise, that their gross neglect Of Justice as to me, would have effect Upon themselves, that, what to me and mine They suffered to befal, would be a signe Of what their lot must be; and when it should So come to pass, my SALT on SALT foretold. In these words, Page 47. That this bears date, the last day of September, In sixteen hundred fifty eight, remember; And that, a Reconcilement be before We have provok'd GOD's patience one year more, Lest I my self be made another signe Of what the former Symptomes pre-divine: For, those Confusions which distract this State, Are typified in my outward Fate. And printed on me by that violation Of Justice, which defiles this Generation. They that seem to have enough in outward show, To bear their Port, and pay the Debts they owe, And for the future a sufficiency; So also, if I had my right, have I. As (notwithstanding this) with much ado, They now subsist; so fares it with me too. As at the present, their Expences be More then their Incomes, so it is with me. I have more Foes then Friends; and much I am Deceived, if they may not say the same. My Foes and Troubles in another year Will ruine me, and so will also their, If he, on whose assistance I depend, Prevents not what their foes and mine intend, Before another year wheels round, I may Enjoy an outward peace, and so might they, If they embrace the means that will be shown, And follow not devices of their own. If timely Justice be vouchsaf'd to me, By timely Mercies they secur'd shall be. If I permitted am to be destroy'd, Their power, will not long after be enjoy'd. Moreover, my DARK-LANTERN fore-declar'd As plainly (as such things might be averr'd In such like times) what, Cromwell had design'd, That they in power (had they been so inclin'd) Might have prevented it, when shew he made To give up that Commission which he had. And had they been so prudent to have tookt, They, his White Lyon, at that time had dockt. These were my words: A homebred Lyon, of a Hair unknown In Affrica, by being over-grown, And dreadful to his Keepers, shall thereby Increase the rage of smother'd Jealousie, And loose his Tail, except betwixt his paws He couch his head, and hides his teeth and claws, Or else grows Rampant: what will follow then? Ask those you credit, they are cunning men; Of me you ask in vain, for tis my fate Never to be believ'd, till 'tis too late. I, likewise did by parable expresse In that book, with what servile flatteries They fawn'd on their own Creature, whom they had Hew'd out of common blocks, and Idols made, With what would follow it: and, my intent VVas not, by my Perpetuall-Parliament To make that such (as some have thought I meant) But, rather that Defignment to prevent By some Diversion: for, full well I knew, That my proposals they would not pursue. And, they who my Poetick fury read, VVhich was by me last winter published, May thence collect, that I did then forsee The Kings Return, and how it so would be, Though I my proconjectures did expresse (As then I thought) with some ambiguousnesse To be excus'd; because, of that Relation VVhich then I had, and my Faiths preservation: For, though that Poets in the worlds first ages, VVere Prophets, Priests, and Magisterial Sages, And, in all former times (as in Commendam) Have been allow'd a Quid libet audendum; Yea, though there doth to sacred poesie, Belong a necessary Liberty In Language, not so pertinent to those VVho hammer their Conceptions out in prose, Yet, that Good Spirit, which directs their Muses, Therewith, a prudent warinesse infuses, That Malice may not thereat take offence To do them wrong, without much impudence, Or grosse Injustice; and, for which wrong, he VVill take Revenge, by whom inspir'd they be, VVhen he shall pleased be to call them to That work, which he prepared them to do. And though my musings hitherto appear But dreaming Fancies, whereat many jeer; They who observe what at the foresaid time Befel to me, and afterward to them, And also knew, that all true Christians be Kings, Priests, and Prophets too, in some degree, Shall find at last, that this Age prophets had, And sober men, (though they were judged mad) VVhom God stir'd up, to set before their eyes Those needful Cautions which vain men despise, Because, it pleaseth him to give them passe By Instruments more scorn'd then Balaams Asse. There are some at this day, on whom nick-names Are cast; and, whom, the Vulgar much defames; Who (thouoh they failings have) are by Gods warrants Authorized to do such needful Errants As to these times relate, and to deride Our complements, our vanities and pride: And, whatsoever Spirit them hath moved, VVe (not without cause) are by them reproved Of things, whereto our consciences, with them Bear witnesse, though their persons most contemn. Among these (as aforesaid) I am one By whom the work of GOD is to be done; And he thereto is pleased to make use Of poesie (at this time) when th'abuse Of that gift, hath prophaned it, much more By Ribaldries, then ever heretofore. It may be too, I serve my Generation Thereby (although not wealth nor reputation It gets me) and my GOD, as well as they VVo seek to take my purchas'd Lands away, As sanctified to them; for, ev'n by these My scriblings (as to term them some do please) Occurrences, which else would be forgot, (And passages which many minded not) VVill so remembred be, that GOD shall have Some glory by them, and men good receive. And though I take no care at all to trick My Poems up, with flow'rs of Rhetorick, A day will come, wherein with due respect They shall more heeded be, and take effect. You, who believe this, and each Dispensation Of GOD's, to merit your Consideration, Improve them as you ought, in what strange ways, Or, in what form soe'er he them conveys: And though you suffer many persecutions, Or losses, in the various Revolutions Which do or may befal; be of good chear; Yea, whatsoever you shall see or hear, Be not afraid of ought, which this last Turn May threaten to bring on, or to adjorn: Nor be discouraged what ere the King Permits, omits, or acteth, which may bring Harm in estate or person: for, he comes To do GOD's work, and executes his dooms, With, or against his will, and shall proceed No further, then hath been by hlm decreed. His pow'r and heart are always in his hands: As well as we, accomptable he stands For all that he shall do: and GOD of him Now proof is making, as he did of them Who reigned last. Yea, peradventure now In proving him, is also proving you And me, and all these Nations, that his Grace And Justice one another may embrace. In which TEST, if we meekly wait th'Event, Till we behold how far this Parliament Will stretch their mercy; and then, till we see How far, the Kings Grace will extended be, (Of his meer Goodness, and Self-inclination, Beyond their narrow limited Compassion) You, either shall by him, have an effect To answer what you justly may expect Or by GOD's Providence, who, if he please, Can turn your losses to advantages. For Consequents will follow to requite Your long-long sufferings in the worlds despight. GOD will appear, for your just vindications, Who truly sought the welfare of these Nations In order to his glory; and so do it, That, to be his own Act, most men shall know it. And, by the King that Grace vouchsafe will he, Except his heart as hard as Pharaohs be; Or, is by such Inchaunters led aside, As Jannes and as Jambres typified. Try all things ere you counter act, and heed Whether or no from GOD they do proceed: For, by their work, if well the same you mark, Are work-men known, and work-men by their work As truly as a Tree is by his Fruit; His bark, his leaves, his blossoms and his root. Since all is in GOD's hand, rest well assur'd That your chief interest will be secur'd In his best times, although the Royal power He more exalts, and brings the people lower. For, his way, to the highest exaltations. Is by Debasings, and by Degradations. And, whether more or less, he gives or takes, To, or from him, or them, 'tis for their sakes Conferred or withdrawn, to whom pertains That Kingdom, within which, no Tyrant reigns. GOD, is our King, and doth but him depute To be here for a time, his Substitute: We are his people, and his pasture-sheep, Whom he is sent to govern, feed and keep; Not to oppress, to fleece, or to devour; And, GOD, retains us always in his power. What, can we have, or wish for, more then this? In whose hand are we safe, if not in his? Whether we have a Government or none, Whether it be by Many, or by One: In him External and Internal peace Must sought for be; In his especial Grace Is our Well-being: and without the same, All Governours, by whatsoever name Distinguished, and ev'ry Government, Which all the wit of mankind can invent, Will be destructive: and, when left we be Unto our selves, such, to our selves are we. When we have Kings, &amp; hope that they will save us From wrongs, they oft endeavour to enslave us. The more pow'r we upon them doe confer, The more thereby at last enslav'd we are. For, they of Wealth and Pow'r admit no measure That's not as large as their own will and pleasure. If you confine them by a thousand laws, They break those bonds as easily as straws; And oft, when large in promise them we find, Their own advantage chiefly is design'd. When on a Parliament our trust we laid, We thereby were oppressed and betray'd; And, may set up (as things are carried on) Four hnndred Tyrants in the stead of one; Or, make that which our bondage should prevent, Help to inslave us by our own consent. If rather, in an Army we confide, They'l either turn unto another side, Or else prolong their service, till it shall Effect their ends, or eat us out of all. If on the common people we depend, They heed not that which to their Weal doth tend In common: for, their individual cares Are to encrease, or keep their private shares. And to enjoy their Lusts a year or two, Will all their own posterity undo. If to themselves they should assume their power, They could not use it prudently one hour: So, scatter'd lies, through many heads, their brain, That half a Nut-shell will their wits contain: And fire and water, may as well agree, As they, who of so many Judgements be, The Nobles would deserve our trust no better; For, they would still endeavour to be greater, By making others lesse; and breed distractions Incurable, by everlasting Factions. Most men, the trust on them impos'd, abuse; As well the chusers, as they whom they chuse: The first so slavish and so brutish are, They'll sell their birthrights, for Rost beef and beer, (As they but lately did) and, so, expose Our Lives, Estates and Freedoms unto those, VVho look more like our tumblers and our players, Then Senators, by whom our Grand Affairs Should be determined. The Last, with zeel Make shew a while, to serve the Commonweal, Till thereby, some Advancement gain they may, And, then, their zeal is turn'd another way. If, our chief city, we our Trustee made, Shee, to inlarge her charters, and her trade, To make her self more pow'rful, and more rich, Hath ever been inclin'd so over-much: And, to and fro, her self so often windes, To this and that, as she occasion findes, That, when in her we do repose our trust, VVe shall have charters written in the Dust. Yet, for the love which thereunto I bear, Or, rather for the sake of those in her, Whose prayers, faith and tears, have hitherto Preserv'd her, I shall, still, as now I do, Marke my Petition for her preservation, And, that she may by Justice and Compassion Break off from those sins, for which I discover, A Cloud of Judgements to be hanging over: And, which e're since the last great plague hath been, Sometimes approaching, though by few men seen; And which, whilst she to pow'r and wealth aspires, Will by unheeded, immaterial fires, Consume her dwellings, and decay her Trade, Unless atonement speedily be made By works of mercy, and that sacrifice Which GOD hath promis'd he wil lnot despise. These Trustees, will at last deceive us, whether We trust them singly, or else altogether. If then, we should to this conclusion draw, Be govern'd by the Letter of the Law; That, in it self, is grown so questionable, So like a Nose of Wax, so variable, And so uncertain made, as Lawyers please To make them speak for their advantages VVho most advantage them; that, we shall there Continue as unsettled as we were, Till we are certain in what sense to take them; VVhich will not be as long as Lawyers make them, VVho take more care to drive their own ends on, Then to provide that Justice may be done, Let me be bold to write Truths without blame, (VVhich I know may be written without shame) No person, persons, or that Government VVhich wisest men by general consent Shall constitute, is able to bring hither Both Truth and Peace, to settle them together, Until Almighty GOD shall to this Nation A means discover for the Regulation Of those, who for their private interests, Confine both Law and Gospel to their brests: For, from them chiefly, most of all that springs, Which either to this people or their Kings, Hath hurtful been; and till this be amended, Our Plagues may be adjourn'd, but never ended: For, by this means (mark if it be not so) Humane Affairs, thus for the most part go. Councils and Parliaments do counter-act Unto themselves, in Judgement, and in Fact. And the same person, by the self-same Law. For the same deed, they honour, hang, and draw. Howe'er the Pow'r in being forms the Cause, For that, streight speaks Divinity and Laws. Let but another Pow'r assume the Throne, Which quite contraries what the last hath done, Both Law and Gospel streight confirms the same, Ev'n by their tongues from whence the Judgement came Which ratifide the former, and had laid Strict penalties to make their Votes obaid; So, that which was the last year Truth and Reason, Is made the next year Heresie and Treason; And, Judges act that guilt which they condemn In others, whilst they are condemning them. Oh impudence! how! how! is Justice lost? How are poor men, like Dogs in blankets tost? What great Revenues have been yearly paid, And what vast sums bestow'd to be betray'd! Or, were at best, upon blind Guides confer'd, Who knew not, whether they went right, or err'd? GOD bless the King, and teach him what to do; GOD bless the People, and GOD bless me too; And keep us with our several Interests, From being wrong'd by Lawyers and by Priests; And, from Aspersion, keeps them also free, Who in those Callings, just and honest be. These things I have observ'd: let us therefore Trust to our selves, or other men no more; But, wholly leave to GOD our grand affairs, Lay by our Swords: betake us to our Pray'rs, And learn to use such Weapons which will shatter Such Fortresses, as Canons cannot batter; Lest, else, as lately, we do fight again Our selves, out of one mischief into twain; Which into twenty more may be improved, Before it shall be totally removed. A Conquest by the Sword we lately had, But, that, our sins and follies frustrate made: We were by GOD's aid made victorious then, By letting forth the blood of other men: But the next Victory to be bestown, Must purchas'd be, by shedding of our own: Yea (mind this well) it to the Saints pertains, To bind in fetters and in iron chains Both Kings and Peers, and that these also may Break off those bands, and cast those cords away: If to assume that pow'r the Saints begin Unseas'nably, or lose it by their sin; Or, if they shall pursue the will of GOD With carnal weapons, in a carnal mode, Seeking their own ends, when they his pretended, For, with sad Sequels those ways are attended. And, they will worthily be then corrected, With that, which must upon them be inflicted. But, when Repentance, and a fleshly doom, Hath purifi'd them, they shall overcome By being vanquisht, and prevail much more By loosing, than by winnning heretofore. Men have their failings; but a fiery Tryal VVill purge the dross, which want of self-denial Within them left; and when thats fum'd away, They will be Gold refin'd without allay. In our own places, let us truly do VVhat duty to Superiours calls us to. (An absolute Obedience unto none My conscience ows, save unto GOD alone; Yet, to what Soveraign power adjudgeth fit, I'le actively or passively submit) Let souldiers fight; give Pilots room to steer; When we move, let us move in our own sphear, Our safety, from henceforth, expecting, from No Mountain, but from that, whence it must come. VVe had ere while a Power, which to our cost We misemploy'd, and therefore now tis lost. VVe, lately, active were ev'n unto blood; But, now such activenesse will do no good, And, we must passive be, till GOD shall please Our sins to pardon and to give us ease: And he will shew us then what must be done, If him with patience we attend upon. What we desired, he did not deny us; And, by what we desir'd, he now will try us. We have a King again: and since God gave him Upon such terms, as most desired to have him, VVe ought not to repine, or to receed From that which we to him have promised; For, we our duties are oblig'd to do, VVhether he keeps his promises, or no. Leave him, unto that Cov'nant which was made 'Twivt GOD and him, when he admittance had: For, GOD, on our behalf, when that was done, Premised terms, though we our selves made none, (Ev'n such, as long ago upon record Expressed were, in his revealed word) And, if he keep them not, 'twill worse succeed With him, then if his sign'd and sealed Deed He should to us infringe (though Dispensations He had, from all the Prelates in these Nations, And Rome to boot) which, I should fear to say, If somewhat did not warrant me I may. His power now is great; yet, had been more Then ever English King had heretofore, (As I conceive) had he content remain'd VVith what was providentially obtain'd Not looking backward, to hedge in the time, VVhich will be no advantage unto him. Had he not sought his Honours Reparation, By building it upon the old Foundation On which it stood; not thought it best to own, That Interest, which GOD had overthrown, (And Humane Policy inclin'd him to) He might have done more then he now can do. For Conquest giveth rather more then lesse Then he did by Inheritance possesse; And his Re-entry was equivalent To Conquest, though gain'd by assent: For Free Assent was given by no more Save those who were of his own side before; Until they saw he had that power supreme VVhich warranted Allegiance unto him; And that he had acquired interests In what they claim, by plowing with their Beasts: For, where WAR is, till peace, renew'd shall be In terminis, a Conqueror is he, VVho victory by Stratagems hath gain'd As truly, as when by the sword attain'd. And his Admittance (whatsoe'er is thought) VVas by none else, but his own party wrought Through GOD's permission, who, befooled them VVho had been false unto themselves and him. It is a Conquest, which the LORD of Hosts Confer'd on him (although no blood it costs) And they who do admit, without condition, A Foe profest, can challenge no fruition Of any right, which was enjoy'd before, But that which he is pleased to restore; Till for Omissions, or for things misdone, GOD takes from him again what he had won, As, but a few months past from them he did, Who in this Government did him preceed: And, this point I insist on to declare That (since of us our Trustees had no care) How much to GOD we shall obliged be, If from our hazards he shall set us free By moving this Kings heart, us to restore To those enjoyments which we had before. When first the Norman by the sword came in, A part of what the peoples right had been Was by contract secur'd: when Solomon Was dead, although the Kingdome to his son Fell by inheritance; yet, maugre that, The Israelites came to capitulate With Rehoboam, and (as it appears, The Kingdoms, and his Fathers Counsellers Advis'd admittance of Capitulation, As no less needful for his Confirmation, Then to content the people: but, he leaves Their counsel, and to giddy Fellows cleaves, Companions of this youth, by whose Bravado's (Exprest with insolent Rodomontado's) He lost ten Tribes of twelve. But, no man thought Our Cause (it seems) worth speaking for, or sought To save our Interests, though we had those Impowr'd, who to that intent were chose, And much confided in. And, GOD did thus For his own glory pre-dispose of us That we might see the vanity of them In whom we trusted, and trust more in him. It had not else been so; for through the Land, There was not sword nor spear in any hand But what we thought our own: nor pow'r appearing For Charles without it, which was worth the fearing, If Providence had not transfer'd this pow'r Into his hand, which we supposed our. So, all our freedoms, Life, Lands, goods and treasure, Were actually to this Kings will and pleasure Resigned up: for, nothing doth appear That we of any thing secured are, Save by his Grace, though some a pow'r then had To get Conditions usual to be made In such like cases: which, if they had done, They had not thereby well discharg'd alone Their pubiic Trust, and, rather more then less, Might thereby have advanc'd the common peace; But, sav'd unto the King much labour too, Which now he must be forc'd to undergo, Yet, peradventure when that he hath done The best he can, please very few or none: For tis impossible the blessed fruit Of perfect peace without pow'r absolute, Should be produc'd, as we are now distracted, And as things will in likelyhood be acted; 'Cause such a Flow'r (as most wise men do know) Upon a single Root, doth always grow; And that, nought perfect Vnity can breed, Save that, which from one spirit doth proceed. If, as he from these Kingdoms was expel'd By Conquest, he re-entring, them had held As by Re-Conquest (which he might have done, Consid'ring how Affairs were carried on) He might have brought most things to good conclusions, Without those interruptions and confusions Which will ensue; for, he obliged then By none, but GOD's and Natures Laws had been; And should have had a large means to express His Mercy, Piety, and Righteousness, By prudent modelizing and contriving (Restoring, adding, giving and forgiving) As need required, without such restraints, Or giving these occasions of complaints, As now occur: whereas he coming in By that Right, which before had claimed been, (As interrupted only) he seems bounded By those Laws, whereon formerly 'twas founded. And (as at present it appears to me) So dubious Laws and Parliaments now be, That by the course intended to be taken, The peace we hope to settle will be shaken When we suppose it fixt; by failings, found Hereafter, in some Principles unsound; Or else, because some actings will appear Not homogeneous to those Laws that are: And, as things are, with us 'tis little better Then if we conquer'd were, for, we are debter Unto the King, for all in our possessions By his spontaneous Act, and Free Concessions; And whatsoever we can do or say, If, now he will be Absolnte, he may. There be enough who for their private ends, Will drive on whatsoever he intends, Whether it be to do us right or wrong; And thereunto, our sins will make them strong, Till GOD again deliver us, who hath Now made us, justly, Objects of his wrath. For, if they are our Trustees duely chose, Who, now of us and our Affairs dispose, (And us into the Kings hand wholly gave Without Reserve) then, ev'ry thing we have Is his; and more it boots not then a Rush Now to deny it: for, within a bush, We shall our Heads but like the Woodcock hide, VVhom by his Tail, the Fowler hath espide. VVe are reduc'd unto a conquer'd State, Though we our selves are pleas'd to wink thereat. The CUP pretended stolen to have been, (By whose device soere it was put in) Is found within our sacks; and we this day Like Josephs brethren, to the King must say: We are thy servants: Providence Divine Hath for our sins made our possessions thine: For, we can challenge nothing as our own, But what of thy free Grace hath been bestown: Or what thou shalt be pleased to afford Upon Request: or, of thine own accord. This we must say, how loth soere we are: And, without scruple, this affirm I dare, That, till the self same Providence, or He, Or both together, joyn to make us free: (Which will vouchsafed be, with, or without His will, when our probation-time is out) We never shall be freed; but, without rest, Be more and more inslaved, and opprest. Then, let none think I wrong this Nation, tho I say 'tis conquer'd: nor, by being so, Fear they so much will disadvantag'd be, As, by a vain suppose that they are free; Since, by not making this acknowledgement, GOD, of due thanks and glory we prevent: For, had the King assum'd the Sov'raign pow'r, (As being made by him, a Conquerour) With no worse purpose, then to constitute A righteous throne (to which Pow'r Absolute Is so Essential that without the same, Less Power, in great Confusions will be lame) He possibly might have effected that, Which to attempt, now 'tis perhaps too late. This, was the mind of GOD (as I believe) When he to him did that advantage give; And, I am hopeful, he will bend that way The Pow'r that's left, as far forth as he may: For, he is neither Heathen, Jew or Turk, Impow'red to do only his own work; Nor we, I hope, as were the Canaanites, To be destroy'd, nor those Amalekites With whom GOD purposeth a War for ever, Unless we in impenitence persever, To make us liable to such a doom As did on that and other Nations come. But, by this King, GOD rather doth intend Our much depraved Manners to amend: And deals with us, as he hath always done With his own people, since the world begun. When they by murmurings for Flesh provokt them; He, in displeasure gave them Quails, &amp; choakt them: And he with us in some things parallel Thereto hath dealt, if we observe them well. When he by Moses them from bondage brought, (To lead them back again) they had a thought To chuse another Captain; for which crime, He kept them in the Desert a long time: Ev'n till all that Rebellious Generation Was quite worn out for that prevarication. This, let us well consider of, and learn How much (and in what) it may us concern. A King like other Nations they would have, And what they askt, GOD, with a vengeance gave: Yet, by his mercy from his wrath did save them, And plagues &amp; blessings therewith mixed gave them. When by the Sword of Nebuchadnezzar, The Jews were subjugated (as we are For our transgressions) though their Conquerour Was not of their own Nation, as is our: (Or, of their Faith, so much as a pretender, Either to be Professor or Defender) GOD, by Him, and by his Successors brought them, Not only to be humbled till they sought him; But also, gave them favour in their sights; Made some of them their chiefest Favorites: Yea, to repair enabled them, at last, Their Temple and their Cities, which lay wast; And to possess again that Land, from whence They were ejected by impenitence. VVhy then should we not hope, since to these Nations Our present King hath manifest Relations: (The same Faith holds, and of his own accord To be propitious, hath engag'd his VVord) That, GOD, by him, will, at the least, restore, All that, which he possessed heretofore? Why should we not believe, that God's intent Is to be gratious in his chastisement? And may apply unto us Lenitives By this King, when he hath with Corrosives First made us curable; somewhat I declar'd Among such other things (without regard) Now, thirty five years past, that doth appear Upon Record in my Remembrancer, Which now, perhaps, beginneth way to make For what my Britains Genius did fore-speak; And, GOD, in Judgement, mindeth us, as yet, In Mercy, though his kindnesse we forget. Yea, if our sins make not his purpose voyd, That, whereby some now fear to be destroy'd, Shall save us from that mischief which we fear, VVhen unavoydably it seemeth neer. For, notwithstanding, for their sins and our, Our former Governours did lose their pow'r; Though they, and we, have justly forfeited Those Freedoms which we lately challanged, And did possess (when after our Appeal, VVe were impowr'd to form a Commonweal) The change which now befals will be of use, Hereafter, better sequels to produce. VVe have but onely lost, upon the wheel A broken pot, and workmen without skill. GOD, hath not wholy, us of Grace bereaved, Although, to Grace, the King he hath received; Nor hath he at this present brought him home At our cost, (without bloodshed) to become A Tyrant, but our King, and unto us To be as gratious, as to him, he was, In thus restoring him with Conditions, Unto his late lost Honour and possessions. GOD, hath from Mesech lately brought him hither Not that this People should be forced thither; Or that their Burthens he should more increase, Now that's removed which did him oppresse. GOD, did supply his wants, and him restore To Riches lost, not to make others poor; Nor from afflictions him redeem'd, that he Should for past injuries, avenged be; Or have a Kingdom here, like one of those VVhich Satan on his Homagers bestows. But, such a Kingdom, that his people might Submit unto them, with a true delight, And worship their Creator without fear, In holinesse, and in uprightnesse here. And, if his Pow'r be not this way imploy'd; The best mens hopes, will be a while made voyd: And his for ever (though he should recover Ten times more strength, and gild his acting over VVith quaint pretences, and the fairest Paints Of Polititians, or dissembling Saints.) For, though the Rabble, who were yesterday His open Foes, now make professions may, Of being loyal, and to morrow should Swear to become his slaves, they frustrate would His best hopes: for, they are a flood that flows This way, and that way, as the next wind blows. The Essence of a Kingly interest Doth in, and by the Common good consist, Ev'n in the whole, and not in any part, (Although as noble as the Head or Heart) And to indulge ought further then it shall Tend really unto the good of all; Destroys the whole, turns Royalty to Faction, And breeds at length a general Distraction: For, when the limbs, the head or heart surpasse Their due proportions, they make others less; And all the body will not onely grow Deformed, but unserviceable too: So, likewise, Kings, if liberty they grant To any part to be exorbitant, Or in themselves be so, 'twill quite destroy That compound being, which they shall enjoy. They further should promote no interest Then with the publick good it may consist; And that each individual, without wrongs, May that possess, which to the same belongs. By Justice he should cause a Restoration; Of all Incroachments made by Usurpation; And recompence for ev'ry Injury Sustained by Supreme Authority, How ere acquired, if the Sufferer In conscience, thereunto obedient were; And no way active in that innovation, Which was the former Pow'rs Eradication. No party or profession whatsoere, Neither the Prelate, Priest or Presbyter, Or other Sect, nor King nor Parliament Should be indulg'd to common detriment; For, that would be destructive to that end, VVhereto all Constitutions ought to tend, 'Tis mercy, and performing righteous things That strengthens Kingdoms, and preserveth Kings; And they are their best Subjects who adhere To Piety, and sound in manners are: Not they who think the glory of a Throne Consisteth in the Guilding laid thereon: Or, in such Vanities as did begin To spring up when the King first entred in: For, though those Fools (who such enjoyments crave Assoon, as of prevayling, hopes they have) Insult, Jeer, brag, and insolently brave it, Cry, Now it is as we our selves would have it, And run out into that Licentiousnesse VVhich evidently may to all express VVhat they desire; he, that, on such relies, Himself, with Snow-balls only fortifies; And will by their assistance be at length As old Rome was, opprest by his own strength. And, if abus'd, the Grace now offer'd be, Some, yet may live another change to see: For, One unheeded sits above our heads, Who mens Phanatick vanities derides; And Judgements in dark Clouds concealed are, Which will surprize us, ere we be aware, Unlesse we with more prudent moderation Shall from henceforward manage that occasion Which GOD hath given of a happy close Betwixt them, who have over-long been foes, For, to that end (though not well heeded yet) The King and we are in this posture met. If, he be now King by the Grace of GOD, (As we entitle him) sent for our good, And not in wrath: if, as his Title saith, He be a true Defender of the Faith, (Which is my hope) he, seriously will heed, How in his cheif concernments, men proceed: And, if he then finds, that, more in despight To those whom they hate, then do him right, Some things by some are acted: and the spoile Of others rather aim'd at, then this Weal, (By prosecutions over-violent To his dishonour and indangerment) 'Twill bring forth an unlooked-for effect To those, upon whom he without suspect Doth yet depend; and make him plainly see, That from thenceforth, his confidence must be In GOD, and in those, who, with him partake For GOD's, for Justice, and for conscience sake; And not in those who value not those things VVhich most essential are to Sov'raign Kings; Though they pretend to suffer for GOD's, cause, And his; or, fain obedience to his Laws; Much less trust them, who did assist the Boys VVith Shouts, Drums, Guns and Squibs to make a noise About their bonfires, hemmed in with Dances Scarce modest, and sometimes with petulances As scandalous, as if those men had best Their Loyaltie and Gratitude exprest, Who, when he was proclaim'd, most rudely swagger'd Drunk to his Health, until they spew'd &amp; stagger'd; Consum'd that, on one beast, which to the poor Distributed, might have refresh'd a score: And, when they should have prais'd GOD, for the grace To them vouchsaf'd, blasphem'd him to his face. If such prevarications do presage A setled pow'r, or a Reformed Age, I am deceiv'd; and wholly had despair'd To see our Breaches in my time repair'd; But that the King hath given hopes, of late, By some proceeds, that he doth aim thereat; And by his Proclamation startled them From that, which many did expect from him: Yea, I had feared, that I might have liv'd To see all Heath'nish Vanities reviv'd. (With all old Superstitions) and, I pray, This fear may wholly be remov'd away: For, what some have expected all along, And, from what Root, their zeal to King ship sprung, By many 'twas fore-shown, who did aspire To publick trust. That, which they now desire Confirms it also; and perhaps it may Be manifest to all another day, When they shall either miss their expectations, Who welcom'd him with loudest acclamations, Or else, when they enjoy them; which to see, I should be griev'd, and, so I hope would he. But if to those things, which do now begin In ev'ry place already, to flow in, He puts not stop, ere further they proceed, His pow'r, herhaps, it shortly will exceed; And, we shall here behold (with new additions) Prophaneness, and exploded Superstitions, Not only countenanced without aw Of GOD, and Men, but setled by a Law: For, this (or I am much deceiv'd) is that Which is by very many aimed at. It was not (as these did pretend) to bring From his late banishment, their lawful King; Nor love unto his Person, or his Cause, Or zeal to true Religion or the Laws, VVhich made so many, who had actiue been To drive him out, make hast to fetch him in: Nor, that they could better be content VVith Kingship or some other Government, Or persons, then with those that rul'd before: But some did hope to have enjoyed more A Liberty, whereby, without controul They might in bruitish lusts at pleasure roul. Some had a hoping of raising their Estate; In some hope sprung from Envy or from Hate, Conceiv'd against those persons who acquir'd Those Honours or some profits they desir'd; And, not a few, who were at no expence In this Kings service, or to make defence Of Him or his Cause, hopefull were to get (By suing to him, and pretending it) Repair of those consum'd Estates, which they Had either drunk, or whor'd, or gam'd away. Some, other, thereby, hoped for fruition Of their beloved Mistress, Superstition; Freedom, to sweare GOD damn them, without awe Of Magistrate, or mulct impos'd by Law; To wast, the day and night, in drinking, gaming, In cheating roaring, whoring, and blaspheming. Without reproofs. Some looked for encrease Of Trading, or of making Taxes less; And, othersome (another way affected) Together with a King, returns expected Of Masks and Revels, Turnaments and Plays, May-poles, Wakes, Church-ales, and those Holy-daies, Wherein young men might have permitted been As heretofore, to dance upon the Green, With such-like liberties as may be us'd Sometimes (if soberly) and not abus'd: And, some, it may be, had an expectation The Lords day, should a day of Recreation Be made again; and preaching twice a day, By some new Canon would be took away; That all men (as they have internal motions) Might have time, for their pleasures or devotions. These were strong motives to some late Expresses Of loyalty, as also to th'addresses Subscribd not long before by many a one To OLIVER, and likewise to his Son, Whom quickly they deserted, though they had To live and die with them professions made Without enforcement, at the first, to make them, Or at the last, so tamely to forsake them. As much they magnifide them in their Lyricks, Heroick Poems, Odes, and Panegyricks, As they extoll the King. No flatring pen Could more ascribe to any mortall men: And, though such dawbings cannot keep from shame their persons, nor from infamy their name, (As now appears) yet, this Magnificat The world still sings. This common strain is that Which most men do affect, and in this wise Flattry still sings to all Stars when they rise: Yea, all her Songs unto this present day, Are but the same, new set another way: And, their Composers do deserve no more Then begging Fidlers begging at the door. Who if it might their servile ends advance, Would, to the same tune play the divel a dance. Such, are too many, who do make a show Of loyalty by their Expresses now. As little worth regarding is their love; And, doubtless very sickle it would prove, If GOD should be provoked to estrange His favour, and permit another Change. They who against one party lately cride, Hang, hang the Rogues; against the other side Would then cry out as loud, Hang, hang them all: And, those whom they now praise, as much mis-call. For, what their chiefest expectations are, They make it evidently to appear By Words and Deeds; and there are symptomes too, What things, if cause were given, they would do. Hornets and Wasps, begin to shew their stings. The butterflies display their pointed wings In every Garden, and there, spawn the seed Which Palmer worms, and Caterpillars, breed. They, who were lately Maggots are growne Flies, In our eares buzzing fleering in our eyes; And up were set, the worlds Gods altogether As soone as ere the King approached hither; Who, probably, in Flanders had remain'd If, otherways, their ends they could have gain'd, And Dick, perhaps, GEORGE, Jack, or any thing, With popular applauses had been King. But, these Insecti, though they greatly swarme, Can do the King not so much good, as harme: Nor can those who through want of wit and courage Will sell their birth-rights for a Mess of Porredge, To this establishment contribute ought, Till they be better disciplin'd and taught: It is not they in Linen Ephods, neither Those Chimerims who now conspire together; Nor those vain and fantasticall baboons Who jet in feathers and in Pantaloons, VVho fix a King; but those grave men among Our Nobles. and the civil vulgar throng, VVho love the Publick peace, and do profess A Loyalty in truth and soberness, VVithout regard of any Interest, Save that, whieh may with other mens consist. The rest (if well consider'd) are a number Of animals, which more confound and cumber, Then settle Governments; and are to Kings But troublesome unprofitable things. I have observ'd them well: and long ago (Perceiving what they likely were to do, Who know the way, as often as they please To bring to pass, their own Designes by these) Upon Occasions given, was so bold, That what I pre-conjectur'd, I foretold; And how these acting singly, or together, To Publick Damage, made use of each other. This oft I did before the Parliament Became their self-destroying instrument) In plain terms, or Ænigma's; as the times Would bear it; and as well in Prose as Rimes. I did the like to him, and to his son, Whom GOD permitted to usurp the Throne, (As two addresses, which I did prefer To their own hands, yet extant may declare) And whereby, such advantages I got As usually they get who flatter not. During the last pow'r (in an oblique way) As touching him, who reigneth at this day, I hinted that, which now is come to pass In such wise, as I might in such a case At such a time as that; with what Events, To his beginnings would be consequents, If on the Giddy Vulgar he depended, In prosecuting what should be intended: Or, if he sought a Kingship to erect Like what meer earthly Princes do effect, Wherein, although I had no worse Designe Then with the publick weal to wrap up mine; I am, for my plain dealing, as a Foe Both scandalized and oppressed so, That all the Mercy some vouchsafe me would, Is Life deprived of all things that should In me and my Relations Life uphold. Which is a cruelty, and such a way, Of killing men a hundred times aday, That, GOD with due avengement will repay: For, though men are not so, yet he is just; The measure, which they gave, receive they must. Yea, measure running over, and prest down, Unless God shew more grace then they have shown. I have not much deceived been, in ought Which with Pre-meditation I fore-thought, And heretofore divulg'd relating to These Nations, in the things they ought to do; Or, unto that, which would require their heed, How therein they go backward, or proceed. I, lately pre-conjectur'd and fore-told, That London was a Mount whence issue should A wind, which hither likely was to blow A change, that of our greatest weal or woo, (As likewise of her own) would be the cause: And, by her aid, that Change is come to passe. Let her so mind it now, that GOD may bless Her future Actings with a good success; For, that to them, this Caveat give I may, Thus purposely I stept out of the way. My Muse once more shall here likewise recal What I presag'd would to my self befal; Yea, though I toucht upon it heretofore, I will illustrate it a little more. Me therefore, to insist thereon permit, For as it me concerns to mention it. It may concern you to, and doth declare That poor mens wrongs by GOD observed are. Upon my heart I strong impressions had, That I, should of their fall a signe be made; Who for my faithful service me opprest; And, they, who last the Supreme pow'r possest, This day, both see, and feelingly perceive, That's come to pass, which the would not believe To them I told, both joyntly and apart, (But seem'd to speak to men without a heart) That, they in reason had good cause to fear, If they should offer still, a Deaf-man's Ear To my Complaints, a very sad reward Would be the sequel of their Dis-regard. Yet, though with humblenesse, I them implor'd By ev'ry means, which those time, did afford, (Save bribes and flatt'ry they would seldome hear Ought which concerned me, except it were An accusation; or to grant an Order, Which more my Ruine, then Relief did further; Or, do me Justice during my Oppressions, Nigh eighteen years complain'd of by Petitions, And, by addresses, tender'd unto them (Not seldome, by some hundreds at a time) Nor to me their Ingagements made they good; Nor those discharg'd by which ingag'd I stood For them; nor for their Debts detain'd from me Three times six years, although made due they be By Ordinance and Orders: nor would they Vouchsafe as much as interest to pay, By them allowed; (though I much did need it, Both to relieve me, and preserve my Credit.) Nor could I that enjoy, which I had bought, And they that sold, (as I in Justice ought; Till my Estate and Credit was o'erthrown By them, through their neglecting of their own; Though they were not alone oblig'd unto it, But likewise had both power and means to do it. A single foe, could do me in one hour More injury then all my Friends had pow'r To right whilst they reign'd, though I seem'd befriended Of many, who to Righteousness pretended. Though early at their dores, and also late, As at Bethesda-pool the Cripple sate) I waited on them, I, went ev'ry day Both without Help,, and with small Hope, away; No more prevailing, then if still I had To blocks or statues, my Petitions made. These Grievances, increasing ev'ry year, Rais'd at the length, my Damages well near To twice five thousand pounds; and so increast, My debts, by troubles, suits, and interest, That, wants, thereby, still multiplying more, I was, at last, made somewhat worse then poor: From seven hundred pounds per annum, brought To be some hundred pounds less worth then nought, So loosing my repute, with my estate. (Which many new perplexities begat) To ev'ry wrong, I liable was made, When no means left for my defence I had. And, most men then perceiving that the Doom Which I fore-saw would come, was then nigh come, And likely to destroy them, in whose hands Lay all my whole Estate in Debts and Lands, And, that the Title which therein I had, Would, as they stood or fell, prove good or bad; My Creditors grew thereby so afftaid, What I then ow'd them, never would be paid, That, more to pay one debt, then would pay two, Was thereby (maugre all that I could do) Streight torn away: and, I could neither set, Nor sell, nor borrow, neither payment get Of what was due, to buy things necessary, Or save my credit till it did miscarry, By forfeitures and burthens, cast upon me So mercilesly, that it hath undone me, As to the world; unless GOD shall prevent That, which now threats a further Detriment: For, then the CURS which did before but bawl, (As when you see a hunted Stag doth fall By abler Dogs) immediately fell in, And from the flesh began to tear my skin. To make Complaints, I saw it was in vain: For, none I know to whom I might complain, With hope of help; and certainly perceived, That, though by men, I seem'd to be bereaved Of my Estate,, yet GOd's hand was therin, And, that the Judgement which doth now begin At his own House, did mark me out for one, Upon whom Execution must be done: Therefore, forthwith, examining my heart, And, finding that far less then my desert Was brought upon me; to his Chastisement I humbly do submit, and will present, Ere I proceed, this my Confession, With Praises intermixed, and Contrition. A HYMNE Of Confession and Praise. 1 Lord, Thou from dust didst raise me, When I no being had, And I in flesh to praise thee, A living Soul was made: That, therefore, I may praise thee, As I am bound to do, Still henceforth let me praise thee, In Soul and Body too. 2 To have thy Will fulfilled, To thee, I oft have pray'd; Which, that I truly willed, Now, comes it to be tride: And, that, my Soul obeys thee, As thov thy VVill mak'st known, I am resolv'd to praise thee, By laying down mine own. 3 Thy Servants are confounded, This day with shame of face, And with great Plagues surrounded For their neglects of Grace; On us therefore to praise thee A Judgement is begun, In which, my hrart, to praise thee Still cries, thy Will be done. 4 And, since by my Transgressions, The breach was wider made, I will by my Confessions Vnto thy Glory add: Oh! make thou them to praise thee So hearty and sincere; That, other men to praise thee Their failings may declare. 5 Me, thou hast not corrected With worse or sharper things Then are sometimes inflicted Vpon the greatest Kings: By Charity to praise thee Their wants thou then supplid'st; And, now to make me praise thee, That way for me provid'st. 6 Nought heretofore I wanted Wherewith to give thee praise; But, what to me was granted, I wasted otherwayes: And, since I did not praise thee when I enjoyed most, I now am come to praise thee When all I had is lost. 7 Oft, when my Conscience chid me, I, in my sins went on; She therefore lately led me To what hath me undone: Yet, that, at last will praise thee, For which, I suffer must; And I confesse to praise thee, That all thy ways are just. 8 The portion by thee given, I, on my Lusts have spent; Sinn'd against Thee and Heaven, For which, I now repent: And since I did not praise thee As I oblig'd have been, I meekly now do praise thee In suff'rings for my sin. 9 Of earthly Joys and Pleasure That most desired are, To me in ample measure Thou didst vouchsafe a share; But, I for them to praise thee Performed not my part; And therefore, now I praise thee With sad and contrite heart. 10 An honest Reputation On me thou hast bestown, That, to this Generation Thy praise I might make known, But by what I should praise thee, I sought a fruitless fame; And therefore now I praise thee For my Reproach and shame. 11 Of Good Men, much esteemed I rend'red was by thee; But, better oft I seemed Then I could truly be: I therefore now do praise thee That my Defects were hid, And, that, some now dispraise me For what I never did. 12 To thee I am a Debter For what I most esteem; (No earthly blessing better Deserving Thanks doth seem) And for the same, still praise thee, Though lately for my sin, That, for which now I praise thee, A bitter-sweet hath been. 13 But, sharp and sweets together (Through all my life-time past) And, single shares of either So timely, deign'd thou hast: That, I not only praise thee For what most sweet appear'd; But, also, truly praise thee For what I shun'd and fear'd. 14 Thou didst with Robes adorn me, VVhich men of Honour weare, That Fools the lesse might scorn me VVhen I thy praise declare: But, what thou gav'st to praise thee, I did to folly turn: And therefore, now I praise thee In Garments thred-bare-worn. 15 To, thousands, much delightfull, My youthful days were made; My Heart was blithe, and sprightfull Thy praise the more was spread But, I with them to praise thee Did not what should be done; For which, I'm left to praise thee all day and night, alone. 16 My private Faith infringed to others and to thee, Thou lately hast avenged by publique breach to me: And therefore now I praise thee For that just doom of thine; Oh! make them also praise thee whose sins have punishd mine. 17 In spight of their Oppressions who my Destruction sought, Thou gav'st me large possessions, which now are come to nought: And since I did not praise thee when I enjoyed more, I justly now do praise thee in Wants, Distresse, and Poor. 18 I, heretofore, had fulness Of every pleasant meat, Which brought on me a dulnesse, That made me thee forget: And therefore now to praise thee. Affliction, bread prepares; And thou dost make me praise thee, in drinking of my tears. 19 Like Baruch, out of season Things for my selfe I sought; Missed by Carnal Reason, Lent, borrow'd, built, and bought, But, left the way to praise thee That's taught me in thy Schools, And therefore now to praise thee I, numbred am with Fools. 20 Yet, as to sink me lower, Scorns, Wrongs, and Wants encrease; So, dayly Faith gets power, Hope thrives, and Fears grow less. To move me to dispraise thee, The more my Temper tries, My Spirit, still, to praise thee, A pitch the higher flies. 21 Though I my self have nothing, In thy hands all things be: And harbour, food, and cloathing Thou wilt provide for me: For thou hast means to praise thee Stird up in ev'ry Town, Whereby each man may praise thee Who hath not of his own. 22 And for Repute or Treasures I will not thee implore; For friends lands, goods or pleasures Enjoyed heretofore. I, rather, ask to praise thee, what most extols thy Name, Although it be to praise thee, In Sorrow, Death, and Shame. 23 Whilst here my sins benight me, Still cause thy Face to shine: For that will more delight me, Then Corn, and Oyl, and Wine. And though oppression weighs me Quite down unto the ground, I, with more joy shall praise thee, Then when wealth did abound. 24 And whatsoe'r betide me I will not change my Case, VVith any who derides me, Nor shall distrust thy Grace, My soul desires to praise thee, and loves thy praise so well, that, might I there best praise thee Thee, praise I would in HELL 25 For, Thee to love thou mov'st me, which shews thou lovest Me, And doubtless whilst thou lovest me, Ev'n Hell a Heaven would be: Since, Love enough to praise Thee, He, that could thither bear, Should make the Devils praise thee, And, quench the Fires there. 26 For LOVE all things created, Subdued Hell and Death; Thy Law it hath compleated, Outlasteth Hope and Faith. Thou, when that love doth praise thee Givest best respects thereto; And, till in love we praise thee, In vain is all we do. 27 Were I therefore bereaven Of all that's called mine, Of Body, Soul, and Heaven, My love should live in thine: And, as I then did praise thee, when I no Being had; So I again shall praise thee, When I am quite unmade. 28 But, never comprehended Can be thy Love to me; And therefore never ended My Songs of praise must be: A Hymne wherein to praise thee I have on earth begun; And better hope to praise thee When this short life is done: 29 Then, when asleep Death lays me, LORD, let me from the Grave (where Dead-men cannot praise thee A Joyful Rising have: Let those likewise who praise thee, With me, whilst I am here, Where Saints and Angels praise thee, (To praise thee) meet me there. Two other Meditations here I'll add, Which though such Musings mean esteem have had In latter times, may now as useful be To some, in my case, as they are to me. 1 Bvt are my Riches gone? and all those fled away Whose love depended thereupon? for ever, Farewel they. Since these have gotten wings, I will not them pursue; But set my heart on better things, and bid them quite adieu. 2 'Tis GOD that gives and takes, whose love remains the same; And whether rich or poor he makes, still blessed be his Name. With suffrings to comply, Loath was I to begin, But better thoughts of them have I, Since they have proved been. 3 For, what I dreadfull thought when first the same appear'd, Hath joys to me by sorrows brought, and hopes by what I fear'd. To be despis'd and poor if in my GOD I trust, Will me at last advantage more then if I nothing lost. 4 Long time I have prefest in words a Christian Creed, And now am with occasions blest to shew it forth by Deed. We, holy men would seem, and up for Saints are cride, But now comes that Probation-time In which we must be tride. 5 Whilst Riches I enjoyd, They made me but a drudge, To be on their affairs imployd, and on their Errands trudge. Me poor my plenties kept; made me engage my Friends; And often wake whilst others slept, to wait upon their ends: 6 They fild me with Desires, whose Lusting endlesse was, And onely brought forth thorns and briers to choak the seeds of Grace. They made me fearfull too Of Tyrants and of Knaves, Yea (which is ten times worse then so) Made me a slave to slayes. 7 My heart then be content, Let wealth and honour go, For, better things to thee are meant Then these can raise thee to. Let those who on them dote, by our deportment see, That in those Gods we trusted not which their chief Idols be. 8 Though my despightfull Foes Now my Estate is gone, (I having nothing else to lose) my body seize upon, Therefore take thou no care, for GOD thy help will be, And put on them a greater fear then they can put on thee. 9 And to encrease that load which I at present bear, Though they say Where now is thy GOD, of whom thy boastings were? He will of me, of me be found, and also make it known, (When open shame shall them confound) that he my Cause doth own. 10 Thy Cross with patience take, doe not thereat repine, But bear it stoutly for his sake who bore his Cross for thine. Still meekly in thy way therewith proceed thou so, That others it encourage may to what they see thee do. 11 The Lot of Saints hath been Afflictions, Wants, and Scorns; And he that is the best of Men Was mockt and crown'd with Thorns: No House to him they gave wherein to rest his head; Him also in a borrow'd Grave, they laid when he was dead. 12 Yea, he that's LORD of all when first with flesh arrayd, Was meanly housed in a Stall, and in Manger layd. A Guest so poor he was, that whilst he lodged there, The labouring Ox, and toyling Ass His Chamber-fellows were. 13 Yet Wisemen from the East, were guided by a star, To bring to this despised Guest Gold, Frankincence and Myrrhe, They fooled for his sake a Tyrannizing King; GOD'S Angels, care of him did take, and round about him sing. 14 To him, allide am I, and he will send to me, Howere obscurd, the like supply, as oft as need shall be. For timely he relieves all those that trust in him, And charge unto his Angels gives, to be a guard to them. 15 In Stables, Barns, and Stalls, the poor as much he heeds, As those that are in Princes halls, To help them at their needs. Yea, unto them he comes, and will their suffrings marke, Although they lie in nasty Rooms, or Dungeons deep and dark. 16 A portion more secure then Goods or Lands is he. An Heritage that will endure when Kingdoms lost shall be. And when exposd to shame their bodies we behold, It shall more magnifie their name then Statues made of gold. 17 But this to them will seem who dote on outward things, No better then an idle Dream which no assurance brings. If pompously they live, and in rich Tombs may lie, Themselves they happy men believe, although like beasts they die. 18 And I am half in fear when this is sung among Those who in loue with riches are, 'twill seem a Bedlam-Song: For, seldome we perceive that when his Mammon's gone, A Rich Man's able to believe, he is not quite undone. 19 It makes them almost mad to hear another preach, That joyes and comfort may be had whereto they cannot reach. LORD help their unbelief, and mitigate their fears For, though they pity not my grief, yet, I do pity theirs. 20 Preserve me in that Grace which now infus'd I find: And let nor time, events nor place, hereafter change my mind: For in them good or bad, External things have nought; But, as Good or ill use is made, Or else, as got or sought. Another Meditation relating to the Authors present Condition. 1 My Foes, you have your hearts desire, a spoyle of me you make; And (as I hear) you now inquire What Course I mean to take. I now am brought so low, you say, So destitute and poor, That well assure your selves you may I shall arise no more. 2 You, naytheless may be deceiv'd, and of your aims have mist; For, in those things which are bereav'd, My wealth doth not consist: And I have that within my view Which if pursude it be, May make me as much laugh at you, as you now laugh at me. 3 But, though it makes you to be glad to see my griefs encreast, I have for some of you been sad when you were less opprest. And if you shall goe forward still in doing causless wrong, I, who now at your Folly smile, may weep for you ere long. 4 The greatest harm I wish my Foes when me most wronged have, Is, that themselves they may not lose by what they seek to save. And when that they shall come to try what they have brought me to, That they nought else may lose thereby but what would them undo. 5 Man liveth not by Bread alone, and that (should it be told) Which now my life depends upon your eyes cannot behold. You robb'd me of External Things, But what the worse am I, If I have in me Living Springs that never will be dry? 6 From that, which you debar me from, me, long you cannot keep; My Noon is past, my Night is come, and I shall shortly sleep. At first, to Wither I was born (though then a springing Tree) And now my Leaves away are torn, I can but Wither'd be. 7 The Birds do live, the Lilies grow, and are well cloath'd and fed; Yet can nor spin, nor plow, nor sow, to get them Cloathes and Bread: I, therefore am without despair, that he who cloathes the Grass, And feeds the small'st Fowls of the Air, will heed my present Case. 8 But if my Lot reserve she shall untill another Life, The worst that can to me befal, VVill bring more Joy then Grief: As Nightingales in summer do, I'll sing all Night and Day; And so shall in a month or two, Sing Care and Life away. Refreshed by these pertinent Digressions, VVhich fortifie my faith against oppressions, I will proceed to make an application, Of what pertaineth to my last Narration. The main breach made upon me (and which drew Those mischiefs that did afterwards ensue) To me did happen some few days before That Parliament was last shut out of door, By whom those Grievances on me were brought, And, then that fell on them, which I fore-thought And did fore-tell; perhaps, that others may Be wary, how they needlesly delay That Justice which to poorest men belongs, VVhen much oppressed by continued wrongs; VVhich GOD will execute, at first or last, Hereafter, as he hath done in times past. In this Relation, I, nor Poetize, (As some may fancie) nor Hyperbolize; But, here, in simple plainnesse have set down The naked truth, that when it shall be known, GOD may be better praysed, and these Nations Thenceforth take heed of wilful provocations. For, greater mischief then to most appears, (And very many complicated snares) Intangle thousands, who destructively Oppressed are this day, as much as I: To whom the grace intended can derive Nought else, but such a life as I would give Ten times away, to free them from Oppression, Who suffer with me, by my sad condition; And, whose complainings, and soul-piercing words, Lie pricking at my Heart, like Darts and Swords. How GOD hath fore-determin'd to dispose Of me, from this time forth, he onely knows; And, his will shall be mine: but, if this change Brings good to me, it will be very strange: For, men prophane esteem'd, would then appear More just, then they who saints reputed were; My foes, much kinder, then they who profest To be my friends, and whom I served best. As yet, he hath retain'd me in their power, Who day and night, are hunting to devour; And, letteth loose upon me such a Herd Of brutes, as David heretofore compar'd To Dogs, Bulls, Lyons, Serpents, and to those From out of whose mouths, Adders Poyson flows; VVhose throats are like devouring graves; whose tongues Are Mints of slanders &amp; oppressive wrongs; In secret, on a sudden shooting words More sharp then arrowes, or two-edged swords; And, were these onely Foes profest, their scorn Or malice, might with much more ease be born: But, some of them, are those who many days Walk'k with me friend-like in the self same ways; And, Neighbours and acquaintance do begin To be to me, as his to him had been: My love to them, with hatred they requite; For kindnesses, returning me despight. Of me, their scurrile Songs the drunkards make, With whom the scoffers in their Jeers partake. They, who as yesterday, pretended had Some kindness, are malitiously grown mad, Combining and conspiring, how they may My Life, Estate and Credit take away; As if until I wholly were destroy'd, Their expectations could not wholly be enjoy'd: Although I know no good that can arise To them, by what against me they devise: Or why such wrongs by them to me are done, Except it be, because I did them none: Or else, for that, their wayes I look into, More, then they are well-pleased I should do. For, be it known, they who are thus inrag'd, Are not of those who formerly ingag'd, In that cause which I lately did oppose; No, no, so justly, these are not my Foes: But, men, (if they deserve that name) whose base Dissembling Heart, false Tongues, and steeled Face, Inclines them to make shew, as if they never Did any thing against the King endeavour: Whereas, a chief of that debauched crew, With his drawn Sword the late King did pursue; And boasted heretofore (with his own breath) Of personal assistance at his death: Another of them, that he might endear Himself to those who last inthroned were, Made Headless this Kings picture; vowing then So to have done to him, had he there beeu. These are my persecutors; these are they VVho help spread snares and mischiefs in my way: And, some of those who yet in pow'r abide, (By playing fast and loose on either side) Are their abettors; for no cause to me Yet known, unless they know I see Their Jugglings; or perhaps, because they fear I may hereafter make them to appear. Whereas, I rather (for my Countries sake) To GOD, for their Conversion, prayers make, That, timely, they their malice may repent, Their own, and our perditions to prevent; And that by our malitiousness they bring No Damage to these Realms, or to the King, To supersiede that Mercy, which I find GOD, to confer on us, is now inclinde, Because our weal and wo will be invoul'd Within each others, as we are resolv'd, And, as for time to come we shall persever In Union, or neglect a good endeavour. Though by your sins, and by the sins of those VVho were acknowledged (however chose) For our Trustees, our late immunities Are wholly forfeited, whilst GOD shall please; There is an open Gate, through which I view A better way, then we do yet pursue, To re-obtain them, and to settle that Desired peace which we have aimed at. There is a hope, this King will be so just (VVhen those in whom the common people trust He thorowly hath tride) to let us see That, he shall prove at last our best trustee, Next under GOD, and for us do much more Then all our Parliaments did heretofore, Or will do now; for, they often do those Resemble so, by whom they have been chose, That, we in probability shall never Accomplish that for which we do endeavour, Till GOD shall other instruments provide To do his work, and throw all these aside. He, those that are in being, doth permit To be therein with him, Co-workers yet: And there's a course that may with ease be taken To build a Throne, which never shall be shaken: For, if that be performed, whereupon The King is re-admitted to the Throne; And, if due glory to the King of Heav'n Shall for the mercy now vouchsaf'd be giv'n, His Chastisement (now twice so many years) Continuing as Nebuchadnezzars) Will make way in this day of probation, To much more, then was by that Restoration Vouchsaf'd to him; for, he establish may A Throne to last until the Judgement day; VVhereby, shall be continu'd (so far forth As may concern Christs Kingdom here on earth) The Majestracy and the Ministry, (If we lose not this opportunity) Reform'd and vindicated (in short time) From those contempts which have been cast on them. Yea, if this King neglect not now to do That, whereto providence doth prompt him to, And would assist him in; the more he found At his Return confusions to abound, The more he shall be mangnifide thereby, If, by his wisdome and his industry, With GOD's assistance, he stall to restore Those Pow'rs, that they may interfere no more: For, then they shall apart, and both together, Be active and a strengthning to each other, To those good ends for which they were ordain'd; VVhich was, that wickedness should be restrain'd; And that each other men might not oppress, But, in uprightnesse and in holinesse Live lovingly, and serviceable here To GOD, and to each other, without fear. My Genius many times inclineth me Of these things his Remembrancer to be: But, I have neither place to undertake That Office, nor a fluent tongue to speak; And should I write, I have so often tride That course and found my writings cast aside, (Though want of will, or leisure to peruse them, Or else referr'd to those who did abuse them) That, seldome times, the good effects they wrought, VVhich by them I have rationally sought; And they have not alone been often scorn'd, But also to my advantage turn'd. Beside, Kings will not easily forgo What they resolve to act, or not to do: So wedded are they to their Policies, And so bedazzled are their Carnal Eyes VVith that bewitching splendor and false glory VVhich Satan puts on Kingdoms transitory, That, as to Jeroboam it befel, Though I should with a threefold miracle My words confirm; a sequel might succeed As ineffectual as at that time did. But, to neglect ought which I think (in reason) Tends to secure the King, may be high Treason: On his behalf therefore, to GOD in Prayer, (To whom I can more easily repair) I will address my self, without delay, In words both weigh'd and measur'd for him pray, And spread thou on that Paper, to remain For those that will to pray them o'er againe; Till that which I on his behalf have prayd, Shall some way to his knowledge be conveyd. Great King of Kings, to whom are chiefly giv'n All praises; who in Hell, in Earth, in Heav'n, Hast Sov'rain pow'r: who Kingdoms dost bestow, Change Governments; set up and overthrow As thou shalt please and alwaies art both just And mercifull in ev'ry thing thou dost: Since thou, by Interchanges of thy Grace And Judgments, hast a long time in this place Vouchsaf'd Experiments which do declare What Thou art, &amp; what, in our selves we are. (Informed us of what is now at hand By signes upon the VVaters and the Land, As also in the aire by peace and battle, by judgements upon Men, and upon Cattle) And pleased art (as we behold this day) To bring our King into a likely way Of settlement upon his Fathers Throne: Perfect, I pray, the work thou hast begun. Let thy vouchsafing him a Restoration, Vnclog'd with an Explicite obligation, No disadvantage to thy people bring, But rather adde more honour to the King, by manifesting that his actings be Products of Vertue, from compulfion free: And left they fall into that great Offence Which may obdure into Impenitence, (As Jeroboam and his people did When their Idolatry thou didst forbid) Permit thou not his Failings, or his Sin, To frustrate what thy Mercy doth begin. Let all these Nations on their part endeavour To make this Reconcilement firm for ever, By that Obedience joyn'd with true Affection, VVhich may deserve his Fatherly Protection: And let their Welfare be to him as dear, As if they Children of his body were: For, no Bond of Allegiance firm abides, If equally not fastened on both sides; Nor can their mutual Ties long lasting be, Vnlesse their Duties they perform to thee, Their Sov'raign Paramount who, search dost make What course thy Vice-Roys, and their Subjects take: And alwaies dost a wicked People bring To be enslaved by a wicked King; Not long preserving any Kingdom clear From Rebels, where the Princes Tyrants are: For, thou acceptest no Person, as to that Which unto Common Justice doth relate; Though slowly, many times, thy Judgements come, That Mercy may have time to bring them home. Since he who governs men ought to be just, On his part let the King perform the Trust On him imposed, and sincerely do All things that really conduce thereto; Shunning such Flatterers, and such Whisperings As by degrees may tempt him to those things VVhich will at last divide them from each other VVhom now thy Providence hath brought together, Lest they by Fraudulent Equivocations Annihilate each others Expectations. With Wisdom and with Grace, his Heart enlarge, The Duties of his Calling to discharge, VVithout pretending more than he intends; Which practise alwaies in dishonour ends. When once the promise of a King is broken, Few afterward regard what shall be spoken By him, what probable excuse soever To vindicate himself he shall indeavour: And though in his Designs a while he speeds That's one in Words, another in his Deeds; Yet, he who by that practice gaineth most, Gets nothing at the last whereof to boast. Let him take counsel from thy VVritten VVord, How he should weild the Scepter and the Sword, Lest they may prove worse Tools, than if he had Been born to use the Mattock and the Spade. Incline him also to enure his Ear, The voice of Truth in her own terms to hear, Lest of such things as to his Weal pertain, He may sometimes in ignorance remain. And since he is thy Steward both by Name And Office, let him execute the same, As one who knows, that he for all things done Must give accompt, and no man knows how soon. For tho, thou call'st Kings Gods, yet dye they must Like other men, and mingle with their Dust Him, keep thou mindful, that thou didst not make These Nations for his ends, or for his sake, But him to be their Servant; and to own No Priviledges upon him bestown But for their VVelfare; and that he should do To all men as he would be done unto. True-hearted men, to serve him, let him take, Or them by his example such to make, Instruct him, LORD, for, one of these will be More useful, than of others, two or three. What he is Himself, let it be known By those, on whom his Favours are bestown, Though undeserved, he vouchsafe to some His Grace, that they more gracious may become; As thou dost oftentimes, when we transgress Through frailty, and not with maliciousness. Make him consider well, things lately past, With what at present thou vouchsafed hast, And what may yet ensue: Make him to mind (If thereof, him forgetful thou shalt find) Through what wants, to abundance thou hast brought him; What Lessons, by Affliction thou hast taught him; What Snares and Dangers, thou hast freed him from, To what security he now is come, Without premis'd Conditions, or engaging Himself with others; or, by what the waging Of War might have requir'd, or by complying With those, who for self-ends, at watch were lying: What Hopes, and Fears, and Doubts, he had that night In which he made escape from Woster-Fight; As also, when he Sanctuary took Within the Body of a Hollow Oak; What secret Vows and Promises were made By him to thee, when he Direction had Unto that LANE whereby he found a pass Out of those hazards wherein then he was: Make him therewith consider, to what end That great Deliverance thou didst intend, And what thou mayst expect this day from him For all by thee vouchsafed since that time. Moreover, make him take especial heed, Why thou with him and others didst proceed As we have lately seen: wherefore, all those And their Adheres, who, most did him oppose, Thou giv'st into his hands: why, from the Throne Thou stung'st him; why, again setst him thereon; Lest else, False Prophets, or Court-Parasites, Detractors, bold Imposters, Hypocrites, Or such like, may divert him by Delusions To that which is pursude with sad conclusions, And not so much to his Well-being tends, As to accomplish their own wicked ends: Or, lest an Over-weening may perswade him, That his own Wisdom prevalent hath made him; And that thou hast vouchsaf'd a good success To his Desires, for his own Righteousness. Let him some way, provide a Reparation Of Publick Faith, by whose late violation These Nations are defam'd; and (which is worse) Made liable unto a dreadful Curse Which may extend to him. Unsafe is he With People that anathemized be. His Person, though their suff'rings reach not to, To those, who now to him relate, they do; And, those Oppressions which are lately cast On thousands, will extend to him at last, If he endeavour not what in him lies To cure their Grievances, and stint their Cries: For well enough it doth appear to thee, That, neither all Men, nor their Causes be Such as to him they represented are; Or, as unto the World they yet appear. As mercy, therefore thou hast shown to him So let him also mercy shew to them Who now are in his pow'r: for, although thee They have offended, they, thy people be; And I desire it should by him be heeded, That whosoe'er against such have proceeded Beyond thy Limits (to pursue their own Revenge or Ends) do so incur thy frown, That on themselves it brings at latter end Those mischiefs which to others they intend. Let him take also conscientious heed, He makes that pardon which is promised, (So far as thou allow'st) so full and free, As he expects, thine unto him should be; Else, Recknings, 'twixt you two will not be even, For, as he pardons, he shall be forgiven. Discerning give him, betwixt Rights and Wrongs, To whom a Frown, to whom a Smile belongs; Betwixt usurpt Prerogatives, and those Through whose Defects, Pow'r-needful he may lose; 'Twixt Formal and Essential Pieties, True Doctrines, and deluding Sophistries; Betwixt Nathaniel, and an Ananias, Men byassed, and men without a Byas; Betwixt thy Prophets, and the Priests of Baal, By whatsoever Names themselves they call: Lest peradventure, some of those he takes Into his bosome, may at last prove Snakes. Give him an understanding heart, to judge Betwixt true and pretended Sacriledge; Lest such as heretofore befooled Kings, By placing Holiness in Common things, Turn thy true Worship into Superstitions, To multiply their temporal Fruitions; Abuse his Piety as much (or more) As they abused Princes heretofore; Besainting them for their misplaced Zeal, When 'tis but such as was in Jezabel, Who fed four hundred Prophets ev'ry day From her own Table; such, perhaps as they Who in these daies do arrogate to be Thy Prophets, or Apostles sent from thee: For, what are they ought better, who now dare To count those Holy Things which offer'd were To Devils; and, would that, as sacred hold For which the souls of men were bought and sold? Such Merchants may among us now be found, And therefore (lest ere long they more abound) Enable and incline the King to try All spirits; that, with none he may comply, Who may by his indulgence undermine His Throne, and set the MAN of SIN on thine. Thy Pastors teach him to distinguish from Those Theeves, who in at window use to come: And make him cherish those that are sincere In thy Profession, by what name soe'er They shall be call'd; since, things may be the same Essentially, which differ in the Name. LORD! 'tis thy Cause, for which I have begun This Pleading, I will therefore plead it on. Let him of Demas and Diotrephes Take special heed: for, perilous are these; And so are also they who do suppose Religion doth consist in mimick shows, Or, in those Gaudy Furnitures, with which The Scarlet-Strumpet, Nations did bewitch: Or in observing things indifferent, As if Essentially pertinent; Or in opposing or neglecting them Contentiously; or, with the mind of them Who said, What needs this waste? for, nor their use Nor their dis-use, but onely their abuse, Gives just offence: yea, 'tis not our abating, Or adding; but, 'tis our necessitating Indifferent Things, which renders them to be Offensive to thy Saints, or unto thee. Let him take heed of those, who with pretence To Piety, affect Pre-eminence: For, those began the Quarrel whence did spring The Breach betwixt this People and the King. And these, Oh God! if thou prevent it not Will re-beget what they at first begot. The King was young when he departed hence, And could not know them then; they, ever since Were in a posture, which supprest their pride, And made them lay their haughtiness aside: But when their late pluckt wings are over-grown With Feathers, they will perfectly be known. Vouchsafe him such a sanctifide discerning, That neither their Formalities nor Learning, Their Fawnings, their Dissembled Sanctity, Or their pretendings to Antiquity, Deceive him; for by such like specious sleights The Great Deceiver brought in his Deceits. Wee old Impostures have, as well as new, And Truth is made a baud to things untrue When men rely on men; and, by Records Of their own forging, dare arraign thy words Before their Bar; whereas they should be try'd (When they are question'd) by none else beside Thy Spirit and their Peers: Which Priviledge (If they might have before an upright Judge) Would end a thousand Quarrels, which will never Till then have end; but multiply for ever. I know no prudent Christian, who dislikes The Name or Officer, term'd by the Greeks Episcopas (and we in English call An Overseer) if Episcopal He truly be, and seeks not to obtrude On other men a carnal servitude. All Presbyters (as by thy Word appears) Are Bishops, and all Bishops Presbyters; And thou conferr'dst precedency on none, Except it be for Orders sake alone, To prosecute such things as have relations To thy Affairs, in several Congregations; As when that we, confusions to prevent, A Prolocutor, or a President In Synods, and in Counsels constitute, To whom a double honour we impute. For such like ends (if used soberly) To some, belongeth a Precedency; Yea, thy Church, being of a large extent, Must have both Overseers eminent, And super-eminent, that so she may With speed and ease, in a well order'd way, (As need requires) those things communicate, Which either Universally relate, Or to Particulars. And, to pursue This Order, there is doubtless also due To such, proportionably, both respect And maintenance, to give it an effect, With which all persons duly qualifide For that high Calling, will content abide; Although it otherwhile amounts to less Than when Corruption sprung from an Excess; And thy Apostle hath declar'd from thee, That thus a Bishop qualifi'd should be. A man that lives an unreproved Life, The Conjugal Companion of one Wife, One watchful, temperate, and hospitable, One well compos'd, and for instruction able; A man, that from excess in Wine refrains, That seeks not to be rich by sordid gains: That neither is malicious, nor a striker, Nor of ought avariciously a seeker. But just, no Novice; one that without blame Guides his own house, and hath an honest fame. And thou hast shew'd us, how he should be chose When Judus his Apostleship did lose. If, I mistake thy Paterns, make them, LORD, Such as may therewith ev'ry way accord; And so the Kings Heart toward them dispose, That as Matthias was, they may be chose: For, whilst for their admittance they depend Upon mens pleasures, they will more intend Their services than thine: but, when they be Elected by their Peers, and then by Thee, As heretofore; they shall defie the BEAST, And overthrow the Throne of Antichrist. Let him no Pow'r usurp, wherby these may Election have, by any other way Than is agreeable to his intent, By whom his Messengers at first were sent: For, by that means, into thy Church were brought Such Overseers, as much more have sought To serve themselves than thee; much scandaliz'd Thy Congregations, and made Truth despis'd. Such, as unlike to those Apostles be Which were ordained by thy Christ and Thee: Their Pomp and Habit, Avarice and Pride, Their Language, and some other marks beside, Are Symptomes which do make it very plain, To whom, and to what Kingdome they pertain; And that they seek not thine; unless, Oh GOD, Thy Holy word I havemis-understood. I did believe the Kingdome of thy Son, VVhich was at first in poverty begun By him, who had all Riches at command, VVith all things in a readiness at hand That might at once have made his Kingdome here More glorious than the Popedome doth appear, VVould not have left it struggling for that glory VVhich is completed by things transitory, Nigh sev'nteen hundred years had they been so Essential, as some think they are thereto. In my simplicity, I rather thought That hee who to advance his Kingdome sought By Piety and Meekness, did intend That way to glorifie it to the end Of Carnal vanities, and should have had Such Officers and Overseers made As rather therewith suited, than with those VVhose Kingdoms Satan hath at his dispose: And that they should have had throughout all ages The self-same Badges, Liveries and Wages As at the first, not such as some do now Usurp and challenge as a sacred due, Making them seem Ambassadours to bee Sent from the great Turk, rather than from thee. Thus I believ'd, LORD, this, beleeve I still To bee according to thy sacred VVill: And thou dost know, that what I now express, Flows from no self-ends, or maliciousness. VVithout Compliances with such as these, The King may reign with honour, if hee please: And with more safety, than if they acquir'd That whereunto they lately had aspir'd. But, I confess, a pow'r he cannot have, Both Soul and Body so much to inslave, As by their help, who in these latter Ages, Have got two Masters, and two sorts of Wages; And, by whose aid, the Throne of Antichrist Doth not a little, at this day, subsist. LORD, therefore, to maintain the Pageantry And Lusts of an exploded Prelacy, Let not the KING expose to desolation So many thousand persons in this Nation, As now are like to suffer, by a Rabble Both unto Thee and Him unserviceable. They, who are useful Officers of thine, According to that Antient Discipline, Which from thy Holy Word we do derive, And from the practice of Times Primitive, May be provided for, without that cost Which hath for many years on them been lost; Without incurring needless violations Of Contracts, or th'Ingagements of these Nations; Without exposing many Families To suddenly-destructive Miseries; And without hazarding of those Events Which to such harshness may be Consequents. The Temp'ralties and Lordships they possest, Belong'd not to the Calling they profest. When first they were conferr'd, they brought perdition To Piety, encrease to Superstition, And Mischief to the Saints; for which they are Ejected from them by that Ciuil War VVhich they occasion'd; and though re-possession They may have for a while, by thy permission, I have a thought, that at their Restoration (As a new laying Jericho's foundation) Some signal thing will then bee done that shall Declare, thou art not pleased therewithall; Which, from thy purpose if it disagree, Pardon this babling of my thought to thee. That thus, Oh LORD, my heart is now inclin'd Concerning these, to speak to thee my minde, 'Tis not because thou need'st it should bee told, But, that hereby, some other better should Consider what by their means may befall, Both in things ghostly, and things corpor'al. Thou knowest that it is not my estate, Which is by these in hazard now of late To bee bereft: for whether unto these, Or unto mee, to give it thou shalt please, I am content; since all the world is thine, And so much as is needful, shall bee mine. Thou likewise knowest that of none of these, I judge the Persons, or the Consciences; But, that I am in charity with all, And, leave them by thy Doom to stand or fall. The various Forms of worshipping of thee; Within thy Church are no offence to mee; Because there may bee possibly Salvation Through Christ, in every Christian Dispensation, To those, who with a conscientiousness, Believe and practice what they do profess. The Prelates, not thy Bishops, I oppose, Nor Prelates, if they nought on mee impose; For, when they less esteem Things Transitory, They may bee instrumental to thy Glory; And, to thy Congregations will dispence Thy Sacred Mysteries, without offence: When we a little more are rub'd together, To scour away the Rust from one another. Although the Name of Bishop doth offend, Thy Son his Congregations did commend To Overseers, as well as to Preachers; (To Deacons, and to ordinary Teachers) And doubtless, though Ambition strained further That Discipline, a Primacie of Order Is now so needful, that when thou hast broke The Bile of Pride, and quite away hast took From that Imposthumation all the Core, Thy Church will govern'd be as heretofore. The Prelates being grosly led aside By their O'er-weening, Avarice and Pride, VVould have thy Church, LAODICEA-like, Her Glory, in External Pomp, to seek; Their Faction onely they conceive to bee That Holy Church, which is approv'd by thee: Like her, shee boasteth that shee nothing needs, That all Reformed Churches she exceeds, And, much triumphs now, in the restitution Of her adored Rags of Superstition: But if their Prelacy aside they lay, Therewith, will all their Trinkets fall away: The Treble, Mean, the Tenor and the Base, And Counter-tenor, to a Diapase. Thou then shalt bring, and to this people give The Grace, as well to love and to believe, As hear and do; and every differing String Shall to the Musick such a Concord bring, That, what at present doth obstruct our Peace, Shall to thy Praise hereafter adde increase. This I believe, LORD, let us wait upon Thy will with patience, till this shall bee done. Mean-while preserve the People and the King, From those ensnarings, which these, else, may bring Upon the Conscience; or, lest wee by them May bee withdrawn from thy Jerusalem, To Babylon; Let such before our eyes Unmasked stand, by whatsoe'r disguise They are conceal'd: For, much I am affraid, A Game is dealing now, which may be play'd To thy dishonour, and Wolves forth be sent Among thy Lambs to frustrate his intent, Who sent Lambs among Wolves: for as of old Wee were fore-warn'd, that some Deceivers would Say, Here is CHRIST, and there is CHRIST, that they Might set a false Christ up: So, at this day, That undiscern'd the Antichrist may bee, Some, tell us This some, tells us, That is Hee: But, by such signal marks him thou hast shown, That hee to many thousands is well known. Reveal him also to this King, and shew, How they to whom there's Double Honour due, May with all Necessaries bee supplide, More to th'advance of Piety than Pride: That other Nations, by that good Example, May joyn in building thy Essential Temple Withsuch Materials as may not confound The Parts thereof, or make the Whole unsound. And cause this King a Pattern to become Of Justice to all Kings in Christendome. To that end I implore thy Majesty (For thine own Honours sake which else thereby May bee eclips'd) that hee usurp not on The Consciences of Men, which is thy Throne; Nor suffer any other in thy Name, And with false Warrants to usurp the same. For, by that Rule whereby intrude they shall On one indifferent thing, they may bar all; And ere they leave encroaching thereupon, Of Christian Liberties, not leave us one. Inslaving of the Conscience, to all evil Sets open Gates: and only for the Devil Or Antichrist, it maketh Proselytes, And, doth but fill the world with Hypocrites. Therefore, to all, who Faith in the profess, Who keep thy Moral Law, and common Peace Endeavour to preserve by word and deed, Let such a Freedome bee by him decreed; That Truth and Errour, whilst within those Lists They keep themselves, may for their Interests, Contend at will; and let those punish'd bee, VVho break those Lists, as Traytors unto thee. For, whereso'er this prudently is done, The fall of Babylon is there begun; And Christ will give true Judgement betwixt them VVho yet contend, in his appointed time. For this King's likewise, and this people's sake, Both Him and Them, henceforth, so wary make, That neither Vow, nor Covenant, nor Oath, They violate: for, thou so much do'st loath Unfaithfulness, that when thy People made A Cov'nant, which thy prohibition had, (Yea, notwithstanding all Conditions were Obtain'd by fraud) a punishment severe Thou for the wilful breach thereof, did'st bring, Both on thy chosen People, and their King. A Vow likewise, by Jonathan infring'd (Unwittingly) severely was aveng'd: And breach of Oaths in ev'ry Generation, Hath been pursu'd by thee, with Indignation, Though made to Infidels, and unto those Who were as well thine, as thy peoples Foes. Yea, though men are in durance when they make them Thou wilt severely punish those who break them; As by that dreadful Vengeance which appear'd, (To make all future perjur'd Kings afear'd) Thou brought'st on Zedekiah; and, of late, Upon some Christians, who did violate A Contract with the Turk. Yea, said it was (As if thereof they were a special cause) For Oaths, the Land doth mourn: and much I fear That of our Mournings, they, chief causes are. LORD, Cautious also make this King to bee Of wronging Justice, and displeasing thee, By his imposing Oaths, which may give cause Of Clashings, 'twixt Divine and Humane Laws; Or, which insnare, and rarely do produce Effects equivalent to their abuse: For, to impose such Oaths as may insnare, Which, dubious in their acceptations are; Which, Ignorant Deponents may engage In, or to that, whereof they cannot judge, Or which their Conscience checks at, is an end To which thou never didst an Oath intend, And is a wicked and a cursed Gin, By Tyrants and by tyranny brought in. Oh! make the King, mind and consider it; That, fast and easie, his new Crown may fit. If thou hast sent him hither in thy Wrath, 'Tis what our wickednesse deserved hath So justly, that the same wee well may fear; And that in our Corrections hee may share, 'Tis also possible, as soon as hee Hath dealt among us what our Dole must bee: And then, our Executioners must sup The Dregs, at bottom of our Bitter Cup: As also they, who with a barbarous noise O'er us, in our Afflictions now rejoyce. Thee, in humility, I, now therefore With all th'affections of my heart implore, To let with Judgments, Mercy come along, To make our Patience and our Faith so strong, That, Hee and Wee, our Tryals may improve, To turn thine Indignation into Love; And not as Wee and our late Rulers did, Provoke thee still in anger to proceed: Or, as they did, who, when thy Wrath on them Was pour'd forth, did grow furious and blaspheme: But, to avert the danger wee are in, Joyn in repentance, as wee did in sin. Give to the King, a Spirit fit to do That signal Work, which thou hast cal'd him to; And give us meeknesse to bee wrought upon By that, which must by Thee and Him bee done: For, such and so great our Distempers bee, That they are curable by none but Thee, Or those with whom Thou shalt co-operate Our manifold Confusions to abate. It is a Pow'r to Thee alone confinde To make all in one Houshold, of one minde, Much more 'tis thy peculiar, to atone Three Nations, that, in him they may bee One. Enable him therefore with every thing Which to effect, thy purposes may bring. Assist him at this time, that he may 'bide That Test, whereby hee now is to bee tride; Lest his Return (ere many turns about) A worse Turn prove, than his last turning out. From Sycophants preserve him, and from those Who hide their Private Malice, under shows Of Publike Ends. From ev'ry mans unjust Pretendings, who departeth from his trust, Protect him: for, he that was false to them Who gave him credit, will be false to him: Yea, he that is a Traytor to a Stranger, If he may get Reward, and scape the Danger. Will to betray his Country, Prince, or Friend, One time or other, some just Cause pretend. But, principally, LORD, preserve him from That Self-Will, which Self-Ruine doth become To all who cherish it, and maketh voyd All means which to preserve him are imploy'd. If from those Places where he lately sought His Refuge, any Leven he hath brought, Which working on the Frailties of his Youth Hath sowr'd the Doctrines of thy saving Truth, By him professed; purge it by thy Grace, Lest it may poyson him, and all his Race. Great have been his Temptations; great likewise Have been their many Opportunities, Who sought to work upon him; and if home A Conqueror o'er all this, he is come, It will of him, to all these Nations, be A Testimonial sign'd and seal'd by thee: And, to be thy CONFESSOR he will more Deserve, then did King EDWARD heretofore. Make him consider, that, to be a King, Is not to be an Independent Thing; Two ways, at least, a Relative is He; Thou, and his People, Antecedents be: That, for their sakes in chief, not for his own, His dignity of Kingship, was bestown. That, he hath no just Pow'r, but what they gave, Or, thou permittest him in wrath to have, To punish, when against thee they rebel; Or else in order to their common weal. That Ordination was for Good, not Evil, Save when made by themselves, or by the devil, Which, sometimes GOD permits (for many Ages) To pay his Executioners their Wages. This, well consid'ring, let him not intend, Or Kingship claim, to any other end Then thou design'st; nor practise to grow strong By offering violence, or doing wrong; Lest thou let loose those Mastives which will tear Those Royal Robes, which he in peace might wear. Those Beasts an ancient Hieroglyphick are, Of Englishmen: By thee chain'd up they were, When he came in; and though they then were pleas'd, And fawn'd, they will be mad when they are teas'd, And fly on any thing, fearless of dangers, Or odds, especially, if teas'd by Strangers. This to prevent, let him not now provoke them, But rather, with a soft hand, gently stroke them; Assure him, that no people can disgust, Or disoblige a KING that shall be just. Since, when a true respect to them is shown, It makes not onely their Estates his own, (And will inrich him more then if he could Turn all our Mountains into Ophir-Gold) But also builds him in their Hearts a Throne Of Perfect LOVE, for him to rest upon. Make him but of this minde, and I shall seem Henceforth as worthy of his good esteem, For those Remembrances, as they that in His suffering have with him partakers been; And much more to his honour it will adde, Then if a PANEGYRICK I had made. Make him but thus affected, LORD, to be, And in thy Name, I'll warrant this from thee, That, henceforth it shall more and more encrease His honour; settle Him in perfect peace; All present fears and jelousies remove; End all our Quarrels in an endless Love; Convert all that which will be found in Story Of our late failings, to thy future glory; And, make that useful to preserve from blame Hereafter, that was heretofore our shame. But, if that he and they, whom 'twill concern Now to be just and prudent, shall not learn What thou intend'st; but act as they have done Who lately were ejected from the Throne; If, yet, the King and Judges of the Land Kiss not thy SON, and timely understand What's threatned now, but prosecute their lust, And be as merciless, and as unjust As others were; I will once more be bold To tell them what to others I have told, Ev'n in thy Name: That, though a while they flourish, They, and the Course they prosecute, shall perish. And, this my Prayer (though they sleight it shall) Will prove at last to be Prophetical In ev'ry Branch, as well as Precatory: But be it what shall most be for thy glory. LORD, hear me, and vouchsafe that those Conditions On which thou condescend'st to such Petitions, May be perform'd, and acceptation have, (Although they cannot merit what I crave) For, Prayers can for no man take effect, Who wilfully his Duty shall neglect. In merey too, remember Me and Mine: Increase our faith; keep close our hearts to thine, In all our Tryals: Be not so severe To heed the murm'rings, the distrusts or fear Whereto we tempted are, but pardon all Our Failings, that we stumble not to fall. Grant, that these Prayers may as well prepare Both me, and every one who shall them bear, To minde our Duties, as he helps to crave Of thee, those Mercies which I ask to have. One word more, for my dear Relations sake, Be pleas'd to hear: Compassion on them take: And since by my Adventures they are left Quite comfortless, (of every thing bereft Whereby they may subsist) some Hearts prepare Of them, in their Desertions, to take care: Or, since that they are thine, vouchsafe thou rather, To be to them a Husband, and a Father: For, though they may hope well, they cannot know What Spirit 'tis, from whence my actings flow; And therefore cannot my partakers be, In those Refreshments which I have from thee; As well, because they see men oft bereft Of Reason, and to their own Fancies left; As also, for that by our separation We are depriv'd of mutual consolation. As for my self, I ask no more of thee, But that Grace which will all-sufficient be. Life is preserved with a little matter; And, he that with course cloath, and bread and water, Content remaineth, neither can be poor, Nor miserable, though he has no more. To this endeavour give some good effect; And, so to prosecute it, me direct, That without fruit, my pains be not bestown Through other mens defaults, or by my own: And, pardon it, if I, my self, have sought, By minding my own Cause, more then I ought; Whereof (I do confess) I am affraid I may be guilty, by self-love o'er-swaid) But, humbly to thy Grace, my Soul appeals, VVhich will suffice for that, and all faults else. For what I have done well, the praise be thine: For what's amiss, let all the blame be mine. Thus in a plain petitionary mode, I have been wrestling as it were with GOD, For King and People: For whose sake I made This GLASSE, which else no being should have had. I must confess, my own sad Cause broke in, As soon as ere I did therewith begin; And would not suffer me to persevere, Unless it therewith interwoven were. Fain would I have forgot it; but I may As well, if broyling on hot coals I lay, Resolve I would not feel them, as I then Could from it totally refrain my Pen: For (as I have yet) I had then my share With such, as this day most oppressed are. Yea, mov'd I was, these Musings to compose, When Scorns, Wrongs, Wants, and multiplying Foes, Had overwhelm'd me so, that they had crackt My Brains, if this Employment I had lackt. Like ballast in a Ship, it kept me steddy, When I had else been over-set, or giddy. And, my Afflictions have permitted been, Perhaps, not altogether for my sin; But partly, that together with mine own, The Grievances of others might be known; And that for no respects I might forbear My thankless Office of Remembrancer, For which GOD had with Health, and Food, and Rayment Vouchsaf'd me extraordinary payment, Till I neglected it, on vain surmises, Appearing in some rational disguises. At first I lazie grew; then, fell in doubt Whether the work I was employ'd about Were GOD's, or rather somewhat, which to do, Not Duty, but my Fancie led me to. Then I began to think it might be spar'd, Because I saw that neither much regard My Musings had, not any such effect As I by them did formerly expect: And at the last, I fear'd if I went on With what I purpos'd, I should be undone. Thus, though in Conscience I was call'd unto it, I did neglect it, till GOD whipt me to it; And therefore now am justly thrust among Those thousands, who complain of helpless wrong. I dreaded, that it might encrease my Troubles; And therefore, them upon me GOD redoubles. I feared that some Losses might befal; And therefore worthily have now lost all. My Duties, I deferred to be done, Till I should have more Rest; and now have none. My wives and Childrens ruine I did fear; And therefore I and they now begger'd are: Yea, so much more then begger'd, as my Debt Amounts unto, (for ought that I know yet.) This, by my Carnal Prudence I have got; And this in like case, will be each mans Lot GOD, will have his work done for love or awe; And since I did it not whilst I had Straw, I now must gather Stubble. I was fain To prosecute this (not without much pain) When I had but a very little left, And often threatned was to be ber eft Ev'n of that little. Scarce one man I knew Who cared for my soul; and very few To whom I my condition might relate, Or unto whom I might communicate These Lines, without a mischief or a jeer, When I conceived they most useful were; Nor have I wherewith to the Press to send them, Though I for publication do intend them; Nor have I in my power a certainty Of what should necessary things supply; Nor know from whence it shall to me be given For time to come, except it rain from Heav'n: And (which of these Afflictions is the chief) I freedom want to seek for my relief. And whilst this was composing, the despight VVhich long was riping, grew to such a height, That evil News like Job I did receive, As if the World from GOD had gotten leave To try my Patience as she pleas'd should be, Preserving onely Life and Health in me: For by their Censures many did assay To take my Confidence in GOD away: Objecting, That my scriblings to make known The Times Corruptions, flow'd but from mine own: That, Malice, Envy, Pride, or private Spleen, The Fountains are, whence issu'd they have been: And press'd it so, as if it were a Crime More capital, then any of our Time: Which makes me unto GOD, sometimes to cry, Search thou my heart, and give the world the lye. She dayly seeks occasion to defame me, To make me miserable, and to shame me: She practiseth all means that may deject me, And how she by despairings, may afflict me. Yea, as if knowing I were musing now, On somewhat which her Projects might o'erthrow, Her Friend the Devil, doth afflict me more, Then all that I have mentioned before, By strongly tempting them, whose nigh relations Can most augment my inward perturbations, To be afraid, that I so much prefer My own Designes, before my Weal and their; That, what at this time I pursue, will be The total Ruine both of them and me; And, that what I resolve, doth rather flow From Wilfulness, then Duties which I owe; Or, at the best, from some Fanatick Fit Proceeding from a boldness without wit: And to convince me of what they alledge, They thereof make my greatest Foe the Judge: Which more perplext me, and my patience try'd A great deal more then all the world beside: For, neither World nor Devil could invent A Remora like that, to my intent. I, notwithstanding, still proceeded on To do, what I think needful to be done; As all men should, who know oblig'd they are, Their Deeds by their own Consciences to square, And not by other mens; because, that none Must answer for their faults, but they alone. If this be not my Work, and that work too, Which I was principally born to do, I know not wherefore I was born, or why I lived, but to eat, and drink, and die; Which made me in condition, at the least, As low, if not much lower then a Beast, Considering what Faculties they be Wherewith my Maker hath endowed me: And if such Works as these, are fit for none But perfect men, they never can be done. Was I enabled this way to express My minde so plainly, and with easiness, In my distracting troubles, to no end But Time, and Ink, and Paper to mispend? Are we, by GOD, so often call'd upon To heed what he, and we ourselves have done, (And stir up others to perform the same) For nothing but to be expos'd to blame, Or to mis-censures, when we undertake That thankless Office, for meer Conscience sake? Is Poesie, which Wise Men have believ'd A Gift from GOD, ev'n in the Womb receiv'd, (And, whereby David did both Trophies raise To his REDEEMER's everlasting Praise, And leave behinde him for our imitation, Reproofs of Tyrants, in his Generation) Is that now grown quite useless, in all those To whom a portion thereof he bestows, Except Lust to inflame? To cast disgrace On Vertue, or extol a painted Face? Is it in these days, not to be allow'd, Unless it be to idolize the Proud, Or flatter Fools? I'll wonder then no more, Why Poets are less priz'd then heretofore. No marvel they are slighted; and, perhaps, Cherish'd like Parrots, or maintain'd with scraps, Like Spaniels, and must think much honour done them, If their great Patrons please to grin upon them: For, they deserve no better meed then so, If that be all the work they have to do. This way it is, and shall be still, employ'd By me, although I thereby am destroy'd: And, though it is an old adjudged case, That Poets must be poor, I'll not be base. My Poverty is without president, For I am poor by Acts of Parliament. I was not into that condition thrown, Till they who crackt my credit lost their own; And if the King please, he may make me rich, Yet loose no honour, nor in treasure much; For, had I but mine own, my Debts to free, I should suppose my self as rich as he. From GOD, if this proceed not, I shall have The recompence I merit to receive; VVhich will be at the worst an outward trouble, And loss of that which I have built with stubble: But, if it flows from him, it will produce Effects which to his glory shall have use; And, he will bring it forth at such a time, As, serviceable make it will to him. Yea, though into the Thames it should be thrown, Like that which being tide unto a Stone VVas sunk in Euphrates (and no more seen After in Babel it once read had been) And will be made available to that VVhich, in composing it, I aimed at. Till that time, therefore, I will lay it by, Not doubting such a time is drawing nigh. If this King (as I hope) be hither sent, As well for Mercy, as for Chastisement, (For, we need both) it, such effects will bring, That we in Judgements shall of Mercy sing. For my part, whatsoere my Portion be, I'll take that thankfully which falls on me, As fent from GOD, whoere he be that brings it, Yea, though at me, in rage, the Devil flings it: For (be it known and heeded) not in vain Die they, who in the forlorn Hope are slain: Nor useless to a Victory are they, VVho are suppos'd to throw their Lives away By desperate attempts; since Providence (VVhose way transcendeth mans intelligence) Acts very many times, by things which we Think may to her own ends repugnant be. They who were slain when first the Fight begun, And they who fought until the Field was won, May (whatsoere to others doth appear) In work and honour, merit equal share. Nay, signal Victories are got sometime By that which hath been punish'd as a Crime. To me and many other men beside, May, peradventure, such a Lot betide; However, I submit unto his pleasure, VVho acts in his own time, by weight and measure; And, sorasmuch as I have no defence Against my Foes, but naked Innocence, (Or words, which are amongst them sometime shot, To let them understand I fear them not) I, (that my Flesh may be preserved from Dejection in her mode, till succours come) My Fortress keeping, their Affronts despise, Shoot back their stones, and durt into their eyes; Believing, they to peace will now incline, Or, be reduc'd to harder streights then mine; As they but lately were, who did contemn The Sequels, whereof I fore-warned them. And, if by Storm, they take my Life away, (Which, I as little do regard, as they) It, in their Souls may leave a Sting behinde it, Which, will with Torment, make them sometimes mind it. But, here I yet remain; and for a Close (In reference to our Antichristian-Foes) I'll adde this Corollary by the way, Whilst on his Horns, the BEAST is tossing Hay: For, if deceiv'd I am not, our Disease Chiefly proceedeth, under hand, from these. And though (a farther-off removed Cause Pretending) they bescratch us with the Paws Of other Beasts; it plainly may be seen By whom our Troubles have contrived been. I, therefore, make but a Defensive War With such as mine own Adversaries are; And (to his Captains, as th'Assyrian King Once gave command) intend no Dart to fling, To be destructive to Foe great or small, Whose hate to me, is onely personal; But, as those onely, whose hate doth extend To HIM, and HIS, on whom I do depend. To act the last Scœne which precedes their Doom, They, now new vampt, upon the Stage are come; And though that with the KING, as if his Friends, They seem to side, they come to other ends, Which, he not yet discerning, in his grace Vouchsafes them a considerable place; And, of prevailing they already boast, As if they saw the LAMB, and all his Host Quite overthrown; which me as confident Hath made, that GOD their proud hope will prevent; And overthrow that Tyranny out-right, By what they dream shall raise it to its height. But, many Tryals must the Saints abide, And very much their patience will be tride Here and elsewhere, before that Act is done, Which with an Anti-mask is now begun. Our Friends inhabiting beyond the Waters, And who were of our Tragedies Spectators Now twenty years (though they perceive it not, Or seem not to perceive it) in that Lot Which these have cast for us, designed are (Or in what follows next) to have a share: For, Hamans PUR's on foot; not onely here, But, likewise almost ev'ry other where; And these think, that to take them by his Gin With most speed, is, with us, first to begin. But, there's a Counter-mine, which will be sprung To blow up them, and all their Mines, ere long. Six hundred sixty six, draws on apace, And not one day beyond that, shall they pass: It is the Number of that MAN OF SIN, VVhereto his Kingdom hath confined been By him that cannot lye: and, long ago To many, that Epocha I did show, From whence his Reign begins; And, by a Light, (As I believe) which shines without deceit, It numbers out his Reign as certainly As women reckon the Nativity Of Children in their VVombs, which hath success VVithin a very few days more or less: And of that Mystery, what heretofore I have exprest, I'll here express once more; Because, those Notions which may much be needed, Cannot be too oft told, nor too well heeded. To former Times, this Mystery was dark, And lay a long while, cover'd like a spark In ashes, lest perhaps what at this time Will comfort us, might have discourag'd them Who lived then: for, men rejoyce to hear The day of their deliverance is near; But nothing save discomfort could they gain, By knowing Tyrrany so long should reign. Herein, I circumstantially perchance May somewhat erre through humane ignorance; But, as to that which was essentially To us intended by this Mystery, I shall not fail of; which is to presage That Babylon shall fall in this our Age. Sev'n Numerals the Romane Empire had, Whereby of old they Computations made; And in them was their Destiny foreshown, (Though to themselves perhaps it was unknown.) These, placed singly, as they valued are, Do truly (though mysteriously) declare How long that Empire, with what sprung there-from, Should last, when to the full height it should come: For, M. D. C. L. X. with V. and I. Do number up, in Chronogrammistry, Years Sixteen hundred sixty six; and, that Will be of Roman Tyrannies the date. No other Number either more or less, If none of these you double or displace, Can be by them exprest. If you ask when This Number did begin; I say, ev'n then When Rome declin'd first, from her height of pride, Which was, when Jesus Christ was crucifide: For, at that time her glory did abate. This Number therefore you must calculate From, or about, the known time of CHRIST's Passion, Not from the first day of his Incarnation. A silence (as it were) seem'd to have been In heaven, during th'interval between His Death and his Ascention, as if caus'd By seeing that done which had much amaz'd The whole Creation, when that they did see The LORD OF LIFE hang dead upon a Tree. The Devil, probably, at that time too, VVas at a stand, and knew not what to do. But, soon perceiving that the snare he wrought VVas broke, to make another, streight he sought; VVhich, to prevent, an Angel in a Chain, (His other pow'rs, him suff'ring to retain) Did for a thousand years restrain the Devil From setting up that Mystery of Evil, VVhich in Pauls time he was at work upon. But when those thousand years were fully gone, He rais'd it up; and GOD permitteth him To manage his own Engine for a time, That, Truth and Errour might here for a space, Make ttyal of their strength; and, that each Grace And Vertue of the Saints, by exercise Improv'd might be, to fit them for the prize Prepar'd for those, who shall engage with CHRIST, And overcome the Dragon and the Beast. A thousand years sharp Tryals they withshood; Yet then they strugled but with Flesh and Blood; And, for the most part, all their Combates them, VVere like Saint Paul's at Epheus, with Men Resembling Beasts: But since Iniquity Was set up vailed with a Mystery, (As in these latter Times) with greater Evils The Saints do grasp: for, they contend with Devils In shape of men, in temporal Confusions, Made terrible by spiritual delusions; And therefore GOD allotted unto him VVho tyrannizeth now, a shorter time; And to a certain day his reign did fix, VVhich endeth at six hundred sixty six: And he who knows on what day it begun, May know the day on which it will be done. VVhich I believe will visibly appear In, or about the sev'nteenth hundred year. And thus much onely, thereof to foreknow, (VVith how nigh to an end it seemeth now) May make us hopeful, and our Faith uphold, As well, as if year, day, and hour were told: Yea, and it better serves to exercise Our Constancy, then if 'twere otherwise; And if well heeded, peradventure may Keep some upright, who might else fall away In these back-sliding days; wherein, they see The Beasts late deadly wound nigh cur'd to be. They on a sudden are become as jolly As if they thought it to be cured wholly: And, to impose their Mark, will now begin To be more strict then ever they have been; So that ere long, few men shall live in peace, Bear Office, or a free Estate possess, VVhere they have power, unless they marked are In hand or forehead, with their Character. But, if that, whereof some imperfect views Far-off, appear, accordingly ensues, There will, to thwart their hopes, a New Star blaze VVithin the West, that shall the world amaze; And Influences through the Universe So quickly, and prodigiously disperse, That, aided by concurring Constellations, It shall have some effects upon most Nations, And cause such Changes, as will make a stand In those Attempts which they have now in hand. Yet know, it will but a Diversion be, Not that which must from Bondage set us free. And know likewise, that this which last of all I have exprest, is but a conjectural, And springs from Notions meerly rational, That possibly may, or may not befal. Those Notions, which may variously relate To me and others, in our twofold state, Are summ'd up for a General Fore-warning; GOD, give my Readers spirits of discerning, And so much Grace and Meekness, as to heed His Truth, from whomsoe'er it shall proceed. Such Contemplations are not in my pow'r At all times; for, my Flesh oft draws me lower; And I am forc'd to please her otherwhile, By Strains, that harmlesly may her beguile With hopes of what she looks for in her mode, Till that comes, which essentially is good. And if these both together can maintain My Faith in patience, 'tis not work in vain: For, such, so great, so many are my Foes, (And frailties too, more then my own heart knows) And so malitiously do they contrive My ruine (more perhaps then some believe) That, oft I'm forc'd to answer (I confess) The Fool according to his foolishness; And, when surpriz'd, upon my guard to stand, With any lawful Tool that comes to hand. GOD, hath in bidding to the world defiance, Preserv'd me hitherto without compliance In any base mode (though by bringing on me Great Mischiefs, she hath now three times undone me: And, I am hopeful, he is with me still As he hath been; and therefore, to his will And free disposure, I will all things leave VVhich may to me or mine, relation have: And in contempt, of what my foes intend, These Musings, this ensuing Jigg shall end; Which blame not, if you finde it somewhat long: To shorten Grief, I lengthen out my Song. The Contented Mans Morice. 1 False World, thy Malice I espie With what thou hast designed; And therein with thee to comply, Who likewise are combined: But, do thy worst, I thee defie, Thy Mischiefs are confined. 2 From me, thou my Estate hast torn, By Cheatings me beguiled: Me thou hast also made thy scorn; With Troubles me turmoiled: But to an Heritage I'm born, That never can be spoiled. 3 So wise I am not, to be mad, Though great are my Oppressions; Nor so much fool as to be sad, Though robb'd of my Possessions; For, Cures for all sores may be had, And Grace for all Transgressions. 4 These words in youth my MOTTO were, And mine in Age I'll make them; I neither have, nor want, nor care; When also first I spake them: I thought Things would be as they are, And meekly therefore take them. 5 The Riches I possess this day Are no such Goods of Fortune As King can give or take away, Or Tyrants make uncertain: For, hid within my self are they Behinde an unseen Curtain. 6 Of my Degree, but few or none Were dayly so frequented; But now I'm left of every one, And therewith well contented: For, when I am with GOD alone, Much folly is prevented. 7 Then, why should I give way to grief? Come, strike up Pipe and Tabor; He that affecteth GOD in chief, And as Himself his Neighbour, May still enjoy a happy life, Although he lives by labour. 8 Not me alone have they made poor, By whom I have been cheated; But very many thousands more Are of their hopes defeated; Who little dreamed heretofore Of being so ill treated. 9 Then if my courage should be less Then their who never prized The Resolutions I profess (And almost idolized) I well deserv'd in my distress To be of all despised. 10 Our sad Complaints, our Sighs and Tears, Make Meat nor Cloathing cheaper: Vain are our earthly Hopes and Fears, This Life is but a Vapour: And therefore in despight of Cares, I'll sing, and dance and caper. 11 Though Food nor Rayment left me were, I would of wants be dreadless: For then, I quickly should be there Where Bread and Cloth are needless: And in those Blessings have my share, Whereof most men are heedless. 12 I then should that attain unto For which I now endeavour; From my False Lovers thither go, Where Friendship faileth never: And through a few short pangs of Woe, To Joys that last for ever. 13 For Service done, and love exprest, (Though very few regard it) My Country owes me Bread, at least, But, if I be debarr'd it, Good Conscience is a dayly Feast, And sorrow never marr'd it. 14 My Grand Oppressors had a thought, When Riches they bereaved, That then, my Ruine had been wrought; But they are quite deceived: For, them the Devil much mis-taught When that weak snare they weaved. 15 If in those Courses I had gone Wherein they are employed, Till such Atchievments had been won, As are by them enjoyed, They might have wager'd ten to one I should have been destroyed. 16 But, Proofs have now confirmed me How much our Vice offendeth, And what small helps our Virtues be To that which GOD intendeth, Till he himself shall make us free, And our Defects amendeth. 17 Not one is from corruption clear; Men are depraved wholly: Meer Cruelties their Mercies are, Their Wisdom is but Folly; And when most righteous they appear, Then, are they most unholy. 18 There is no Trust in Temp'ral Things, For they are all unsteady: That no assurance from them springs, Too well I find already; And that ev'n Parliaments and Kings Are frail, or false, or giddy. 19 All stands upon a tott'ring Wheel, Which never fixt abideth; Both Commonweals and Kingdoms reel: He, that in them confideth, (Or trusts their Faith) shall Mischiefs feel, With which soe'er he sideth. 20 This Wit, I long ago was taught, But then I would not heed it: Experience must by Fools be bought, Else they'll not think they need it. By this means was my Ruine wrought; Yet, they are Knaves who did it. 21 When to thee ground deprest I was, Our Mushroms and our Bubbles Whom neither Truth, nor Wit, nor Grace, But Wealth and Pride ennobles, As cruel were, as they are base, And jeer'd me in my troubles. 22 And, when their hate, these had made known, New mischiefs it begat me: For, ev'ry Raskal durty Clown, Presumed to amate me; And all the CURS about the Town, Grinn'd, snarl'd, and barked at me. 23 Since therefore 'tis not in my power, Though oft I fore-discern them) To shun the worlds despights one hower, Thus into mirth I'll turn them; And neither grieve, nor pout, nor lowre, But laugh, and sing, and scorn them. 24 This FIT, at sev'nty years and two, And thus to spend my hours, The worlds contempt, inclines me to, Whilst she my state devours; If this be all that she can do, A Fig for all her powers. 25 Yet I and shee, may well agree, Though we have much contended; Upon as equal terms are we, As most who are offended: For, I sleight her, and she sleights me, And there's my Quarrel ended. 26 This onely doth my mirth allay, I am to some engaged, Who sigh and weep, and suffer may, Whilst thus I sing incaged: But I've a GOD, and so have they, By whom that Care's asswaged. 27 And he that gives us in these days New Lords, may give us new Laws; So that our present Puppet-Plays, Our VVhimsies, Brauls, and Gew-gaws, May turned be to songs of praise, And holy Hallelujahs. Thus I have added some few Ballads more To those, which my Deriders heretofore Have scoffingly so call'd: and, though I please To sing Defiance in such words as these, To make them somewhat wiser (if I might) Who are yet wise, but in their own conceit) 'Tis no revengeful or malitious scorn, Which back upon my scorners I return. My Jollities, my Caprings and Advances, Are not like those you see in Morrice-Dances; Nor is my mirth like their, who chear their souls With Musick, Banquets, and o'erflowing Bowls: 'Tis no meer outward or corporeal sense Of Pleasures or Immunities, from whence My Joys do spring: nor are they such as their, Who by long Suff'ring stupified are: (For, few men living, of all Humane passions, Have deeper sense, or of their Aggravations) But, my Exultings flow from apprehension Of that, whereto my Faith hath an extension; And of those Objects which I make those ends To which my actings and my suff'ring tends, As doth a wounded Conquerour, who cries, Courage, my Mates, the day is ours; then dies: Or rather, like a Martyr on the Rack, Who when is Flesh tears, and his Sinues crack, Casts on the Tyrant a disdainful smile, And in GOD's Love, rejoyceth all the while. That which is purposed by my Caresses, And sparklings from my soul in these Expresses, Is partly to preserve in my own heart Those Resolutions, which might else depart: Whereat grudge not, as if you thought I heeded That which my self concerneth, more then needed; For, moderate Self-love, is that whereby We must to others measure Charity. 'Tis partly too, for others Informations That I so oft insert Pre-occupations Relating to my self, and to prevent Annihilating of that good intent Which I pursue; by taking that away VVhich Prejudice alleage in private may. If these Expressions no advantage be To other men, they are of use to me. 'Tis not amiss, lest I forgetful grow, To mind my self sometimes of what I know, And make to others known, that they who keep Good Consciences, may sing themselves asleep Amidst their greatest Foes: and without fear Awake, when they by them alarmed are: That, he on whom God makes his face to shine, May be as glad as they, whose corn and wine Doth still encrease, and with content be crown'd, Which way soe'er the Rowling Wheel goes round: For, he that acts in suff'rings what he teaches, Moves more, then when but verbally he preaches. But, most men so abound in their own sense, And rather so incline to take offence At such Expressions, then them to regard; That much of this perhaps might have been spar'd. However, neither much more pains or cost, Can I now loose, then is already lost: Since therefore what she likes, the world hath got From me, I'll give her what she liketh not: For, not much longer am I now to bear Her Burthens; or the scorn of Fools to hear: And in my Grave, when I am laid asleep, These Musings will believ'd Memorials keep, Of things which to GOD's glory shall pertain, Till his Trump calls me to awake again: For, though Truths will to our Posterities Conveyed be among a heap of Lyes, They will to those who love them, shine as clear As Diamonds which mixt with Charcoals are: And therefore, till Death quite depriveth me Of seeing that which in the Flesh I see, And Faith foresees; to my Eternal King To this effect, I'll Hallelujah sing. 1 God sits where he doth see and hear, Where Kings and Lords consulting are, And heeds what is intended there: Sing therefore Hallelujah. To make them better understand His Will, and what he hath in hand, He wonders acts at Sea and Land: Sing therefore Hallelujah. 2 His Mercies here were lately shown, They who abus'd them are o'erthrown, And now by Judgements he is known: Sing therefore Hallelujah. He sev'ral ways mens hearts hath tride, He fools their Wit, he shames their Pride, And by their shame is glorifide: Sing therefore Hallelujah. 3 To Tryals every man he brings, He spares nor Commoners nor Kings, And of his Deeds the whole earth rings: Sing there Hallelujah. Such marvels as in times of old, Have either written been or told, We did with our own eyes behold: Sing therefore Hallelujah. 4 He stirs and stills the winds and seas; Yea, Kings and Nations can appease, Things, oft, less tameable then these. Sing therefore Hallelujah. He wounds and cures, he builds and breaks, He kills and saves, he gives and takes, And as he finds cause, mars or makes: Sing therefore Hallelujah. 5 He by contention, endeth strife; By leaving helpless, gives Relief; And, by death bringeth unto Life. Sing therefore Hallelujah. He for well-doing, and for ill, Doth promises and Threats fulfil, And is both just and gratious still. Sing therefore Hallelujah. 6 By doing Right, he cureth wrongs, Turns mournful cries to joyful songs; To all gives what to them belongs. Sing therefore Hallelujah. He giveth ease, by making sore; He makes men rich by being poor, And Loosers win, by losing more: Sing therefore Hallelujah. 7 To crown all this, and cure the fear Which doth in many Saints appear, His Kingdom now is drawing near: Sing therefore Hallelujah. For GOG and MAGOG joyn in one, Their Gen'ral Musters are begun, And their destruction cometh on: Sing therefore Hallelujah. 8 As he foretold us heretofore, Revenge pursues the Scarlet Whore, And she ere long shall be no more: Sing therefore Hallelujah. The Kings and Captains of his Foes Shall then be Carrion for the Crows, And all who do the LAMB oppose: Sing therefore Hallelujah. 9 That we more watchful may be made, We lately three Probations had; And now he doth another adde. Sing therefore Hallelujah. New offers of his grace have we; And though yet obstinate we be, Still merciful to us is he: Sing therefore Hallelujah. So, farewel Friends. I will not say for ever: For though I lately purpos'd, that I never In this mode more would write: th'Event hath shown I had then work undone, to me unknown: And therefore, till he thereto puts an end Who knows my Task, his pleasure I'll attend, And prosecute it, until he shall say, Thy Labour now is finish'd; COME AWAY. Mean while, that I my SOUL may ready make, For such a CALL, and willingly forsake This place; I'll sometimes hearten her along With this that follows or some such-like SONG. 1 My Soul, come let us go, In Sodom longer linger not: Look not behinde thee so, But call to minde the wife of LOT. Let nothing here To thee be dear, Or captive thy desires: GOD will thereon, When we are gon, Rain down consuming Fires. 2 Though with a glorious light, The SUN thereon begins to rise, A dreadful Storm ere night, Her careless Dwellers will surprize. Come, come away, Without delay; Quite cast her out of mind: For worth thy thought In her there's nought, VVhich thou shalt leave behind. 3 GOD's mercies they contemn; His Kindness with despights repay; Still when he speaks to them, They turn their heads another way. VVhen he intreats, Reproves, or threats, To heed it they disdain; Or with a scoff They put it off, And obstinate remain. 4 GOD here hath pitch'd his Tent; And here, had they his counsel took, To dwell for ever meant; But they, alas! have him forsook. This, which a place Like EDEN was, Is now defil'd with sin; Still Fruit it bears, That fair appears; But 'tis all dust within. 5 Then from this cursed Plain Flee, to those Everlasting Hills, Where safe thou may'st remain, And whereon thy Redeemer dwells. Here make no stay: For though there may In ZOAR safety seem, VVhen such Storms be, Secure are we No where, except in him. 6 This is their fatal day, Which day, perhaps, may last a year; And true Repentance may Avert the DOOM approaching near. But, I much doubt, That trifled out This Day of Grace will be. Therefore in fear, And danger here, Our stay, will always be. Now my last Publike Work I hope is ended; Blessed be he that's therewith not offended: For, whatsoe'er it seems, I shall expect A CONSEQUENT, as this doth take effect. My Exercise without me, and within, Afflictions and Distractions, long have been; If therefore, what in haste I did indite, When those Disturbances were at their height, Confus'd appears; the better 'twill declare What mine, and other mens conditions are. And, if therein, ought seems to merit blame, They who are Candid, will excuse the same. G. W. A POSTSCRIPT In answer to some cavilling Objections, made against the Author of this Considering-Glasse, since the composing thereof. I Hear, my snarling Censurers Object, That, all I write, is to the same Effect; And, that the most part of what's here exprest, It but cold Dishes, sent forth newly drest. Mis-censures might be spar'd, though this were true: For, where the Matter's old, th'Occasion's new: And they will here see, if they heed it more, Thrice Fifty Pages, never seen before. But were it otherwise; how much trangrest Had I therein, more then that Country Priest, Who, having (or pretending it) a Call Such to inform, as I oft meet withal, Preach'd but one Sermon many years together, And, till they had learn'd that, would preach no other? Another of their cavilling Objections Is this; that there are many Contradictions In my Affirmatives. This true may be To those men peradventure, who can see But with one Eye; Or, look but on one side Of that, whose Verity is to be tride: Yet, all my Affirmations will be true, When they are heeded with judicious view. This is the same, which often such as they Abusively, of Holy Scripture say, Because they neither heed nor understand How Circumstances, and the Points in hand, May warrantize that to be verifi'd In some respects, which ought to be deni'd In othersome; as in the Controverse 'Twixt FAITH and WORKS; or such: which to reherse Would be but labour lost, by adding more, To manifest what most men knew before. These my Detracting Readers, do moreover, A Pers'nal Vanity in me discover (As they think) which much levity implies. Good Souls! how modest are they, and how wise! I seek for, and I do assume, they say, (At all times, in all places where I may) Occasions to communicate and show What I have writ, and what I seem to know, To all men, whether Friends or Foes they be; Wise Men or Fools; of high or low degree. Which I'll confess: for, to my self alone The harm which thereby can ensue, is done: Doth any Prudent Man a Book compose, Onely to teach himself, the things he knows? Or, for the sakes alone, who learned be, And better know those things, perhaps, then he? Should not the weal of every one be sought? As well the poorest, as the rich be taught? And do not the Prophane, and Fools, asmuch Good Cautions need, as they who are not such? Doth any one, that's not a Fool at least, His Candle light, to lock it in a chest? Doth any, when a Town on fire appears, Call out for help, where he knows no man hears? Or think it onely needful to repair At such times, to the Aldermen and Maior, When two poor Labourers may do as much, In an Emergency, as twenty such? If there be any of this minde, who pass For Prudent Men, let me be thought an ASSE. Though in my Pocket, I no Orders carry Like those, who Preachers are in Ordinary, I have them in my heart; and, in my way, Oblig'd to preach GOD's Truths, no less then they, Take up my Auditors, where I can finde them; And there, in my mode, of their Duties minde them. For I have oft observ'd (and so may these Observe it likewise often, if they please) That, they whom some count despicable men, Make better use of those means, now and then, Which to GOD's glory pertinent do seem, (Or common good) then men of more esteem; And that, sometimes, the work of GOD we do, By what is thought impertinent thereto. We know, the Gospel first to them was brought Whom worldly wise men, base and foolish thought: That, very many Publicans and Sinners Were some of Christianities beginners: And that the Saints then thought it was but reason, To do their Duties in, and out of Season. These benefits are also reaped from My reading what I write, to all that come. Some things, I otherwile, thereby collect From those who neither me nor that respect: For in discourse, before they are aware, They let slip words which cautionary are. To them who like my Lines, it Treatments makes As acceptable as Ale, Wine and Cakes: To those who like them not, they serve my turn Their Interruptions, quickly to adjourn: For, they pretending Business to be done, Requiring haste (and that they must be gone) Straight bid Adieu; and Farewel I reply: Glad are these they are gone, and so am I. More might be said, to what hath been aver'd By such as these: But little they regard What may in reason give them satisfaction, Whose principal designment is Detraction: And fruitless are all rational Replies, To what, Pride, Hate, and Folly may devise. THE Shepherd of BLEDONHAM HIS CASE. Who, was lately ejected out of his Possessions, by the Successours of the Flamins, and Arch-Flamins; falsly pretending a Divine Right to the said Possessions. The said Case is truly stated, in a Pastoral Prosopopeia, by an intermixture of Literal and Metaphorical Expressions. At BLEDONHAM, among malitious Clowns A Shepherd kept a Flock upon the Downs; Belov'd as well, till there he did reside, As any of his Rank, 'twixt Thame and Tweede. Not many in this Isle, were better known; He manag'd few Affairs, except his own: He was a Friend to all men, save to those Whose Vices made them his malignant Foes; And never was his Enmity extended Unto their persons, with whom he contended. Him, their Companions, men of honour made, And he by honest means, possession had Of such a fair Estate, that many more Suppos'd him to be rich, then thought him poor: For, he had Fields and Groves, Flocks, Herds and Corn, Enough to keep him, both from want and scorn. But, that Wheel turning, which doth now and then O'erthrow great Kings as well as Common men, It, with a quick whirl, on a luckless day, So swept his Crops, Goods, Flocks and Herds away, That he of all, was well-near quite bereft, And had but one good Ewe, and two Lambs left, Which ev'ry day at his own Table fed, And ev'ry night, lodg'd in, or near his bed. As soon as this Disaster was begun, Another forthwith follow'd thereupon. A petty Nimrod (as with an intent To hunt some Beasts of prey, which did frequent The Fields where these Lambs fed) attended on By those, who, where a Mischief may be done, Take most delight, did often, with his Hounds, So much disturb their quiet in those grounds, That having thereby much affrighted been, The Lambs became unproveable and lean. The Ewe alone, still undismay'd, held out, And being fat, well flesh'd, and very stout, Preserv'd her own, till an uncivil rout Of neighb'ring Churls, with Cur-Dogs pull'd the Fleeces From off their backs, and tore them into pieces. What these Lines mean, but few of those who read them, Can know, save they who felt the wrongs, or did them: For, they were acted with more barbarousness Then we can by this Parable express; Ev'n by that Spirit, which did first engage These Nations into that unhappy rage Which is not yet allay'd; and will hold on Whilst they are cherish'd, by whom 'twas begun. When this befel, the Shepherd was from home, To stop another mischief like to come; And hearing his poor Flock was worride so, A deep sigh fetcht; yet, since their wool might grow, And, Time, encrease their number to a greater, (In hope things might succeed hereafter better) Some Consolation for a while receiv'd: But, thereof also, quickly was bereav'd: For, not alone decreas'd his cattle be From very many hundreds unto three, In perishing estate; but seized now Are those Possessions too, from whence might grow Subsistence and increase: and (which is worse) Not on him singly, falls this heavy curse, But they whose Prosecutions made him poor, Will make a hundred thousands Beggers more; Whose Poverty may those Oppressions adde, Whereby that number double will be made. By these Mishaps, this Pastor in one year (And less) is made a poor Philosopher; Who now doth bear about him all his stock, And to themselves, is forc'd to leave his Flock, Expecting nothing henceforth but Oppressions From those, who have usurped his Possessions: For, they who on his Livelyhood now seize, Successours are to those old Druides, And to those Flamins and Arch-Flamins, here, Who Prelates of the Pagan-Friesthood were; And, probably, will be to him and those Who serve his GOD, unreconciled Foes; Because they do pretend themselves to be Prelated above others in degree, As Supreme Priests and Pastors unto PAN, The Prince of Shepherds, and both GOD and MAN. On that accompt, those superstitious things, And Heath'nish Ceremonious Trinketings, Which in the worship of false gods were us'd By them, are without warrant introduc'd Into the Christian Church, as sanctifide; And to maintain that Carnal Pomp and Pride Which these affect, they claim, and take, and hold What's due to Him, as due to them of old. This, under colour of a Deodand They challenge; and, therein, a Royal hand Supports them yet, because he knows them not: But, when such information he hath got, Whereby they may to him be truly known, 'Tis hop'd that each man will enjoy his own: In which hope, many thousands now undone, Take up their Cross, and patiently walk on. This Shepherd (not deluded by their folly) Who heed a Ravens croaking from the Holly, Or such like Auguries: foresaw by whom And why, those things which now befal, are come. He therefore, when they came, stood undismay'd, And looking up to Heaven, thus meekly said: GOD gives and takes, and blessed be his Name; Though I am not, yet he, is still the same; And on him fixt, my trust unshaken stands, Ev'n whilst I am in my Oppressors hands; Expecting my Deliverance from him, And nothing but Revenge and Scorns from them. If unto me, he shall vouchsafe to grant But so much Grace, as many of them want, I shall possess, bought at anothers cost, An Heritage, that never will be lost; And ere this Generation is quite gone, That, which hath long been hop'd for, will be done. Believing this, he wholly cast away Vexatious Care, permitting these to play Their pranks at will, till they with cruel scorn From Him and His, their whole Estate had torn; Yet, he no more fears their despights to him, Then they do fear what he can do to them: And may perhaps, yet pipe them such a strain, As ere next Sheepshear will fetch back again Some part of what is lost: for, 'twill be found His late Possessions were but Fairy-ground, And not so sanctified, that all those Who walkt upon it, must put off their shoes; Unless, there be a Sophistry in Schools, That's able to turn wise men into fools. If they do merit to be credited Who in that Mannor-house inhabited, From which the Shepherd's cast; they, there were frighted With Sounds and Apparitions, when benighted; And that therein (before that he came thither) Zim, Jim, with such Hobgoblins danc'd together. And these perhaps, will thither come again, As to a place which doth to them pertain By Tenant-Right, now their Old Lords are come To re-admit them to their dancing-Room. It may be too, till by him repossest They who intrude, may there take little rest; Or, till they shall that wicked Charge withdraw, That makes a sin, where none is made by Law; And impudently therewithal dare brand Not onely Purchasers of Prelates-Land Opposed now by them, but also fling That Guilt, both upon Parliament and King, In whose defence, the Shepherd doth defie Not one alone, but all the Prelacy; And if they prove, before an equal Judge, That, purchasing their Lands, is Sacriledge; Or more a sin, then marketting of Eggs, He will resign his claim, for two Tithe Piggs. Nay, if of Sacrilege he proves them not To be more guilty when those Lands were got, And whilst that they in their possession were, Then any of their Purchasers now are, He will submit to be anathemiz'd By them, and of all honest men despis'd. For, were a faithful Demonstration made Of what beginning Prelacy first had; By what ways, Prelates usually aspire; How, they their large Reuenues did acquire; How they have been from time to time enjoy'd, How often to the publick harm employ'd; What persons owned them, and to what ends Their Constitution principally tends, With such-like; which are left upon records, Whose credit doubtless evidence affords; It plainly manifested would appear, That, none so truly sacrilegious are; That, few have acted more destructively To civil peace, and real piety; Or oftner upon Kings intrusions made, By whose Indulgence they their being had. They, who now heed the posture they are in, And how pedantically they begin To act their parts, since they have been new shell'd Within those walls, from whence they were expell'd, Do wonder much, that men of their profession And parts, should fail so much in their discretion: For, their untimely Avarice and Pride, Ev'n their best friends and favourets deride, With fear, that their Ambition will not cease, Till it destroys again the common peace; And they who love the King, begin to see, That unto him they mischievous may be. Most of their Conversations are on earth; What is this Pars'nage, what that Vic'rage worth? Are their chief Queries, or which way to make Their Markets, and Advantages to take Without regard, whose right they do enjoy, How many Families they do destroy; Or what disturbance or disreputation They bring on King, on Parliament or Nation. To such ends, they of bawld of Sacriledge, Till they have set most hearers teeths on edge, By their continual grating on that bone Which their own Jaws will break, ere they have done. That Scare-crow now, affrighteth none but fools, Who are but lately crept out of their schools: For, that which they have charg'd the people with, Doth yet stick fast between their tongue and teeth, And will be proved by a holy Text, The Thirtieth day of February next. If those Revenues we examine shall, VVhich they the Churches patrimony call, That great Diana, for which some with us Cry out, as once they did at Ephesus, Is but an Idol; and their Out-cries made, Are onely to preserve a sordid Trade, VVhereby those Crafts-men seek to be enrich'd, VVho with their Drugs have silly men bewitch'd. The price of Dogs, and wages of a Whore, Might own'd have been as justly heretofore For Holy things, if offer'd they had been; Yea, with less impudence, and with less sin: For, some of them (as in despight of Heav'n) Were Merchandizings for mens souls, and giv'n In high contempt of him, whose heart-blood bought That, which they to a worthless price have brought, Yet sold too dear; because the Buyers lost As well as their own safe-being, as their cost. Meer simple ahd despairing Malefactors VVere by the Devils Brokers and Contractors, Abused with Mock-pardons: Heirs defeated Of their Estates; Widows and Orphanes cheated; And many a poor soul with a Pasport sent To Heav'n, as he thought, when to Hell he went. This way, had those possessions their advance, Which now are termed GOD's Inheritance; And what can be a greater Derogation From him then this? Or, what a Provocation More daring, then for men to challenge that As his, which he doth more abominate Then Dogs or Strumpets? Or, what can in reason More properly reputed be high Treason Against the King, then to engage him for An Interest which GOD doth to abhor? And which insensibly may draw him in To be a partner with the MAN of SIN In guilt and punishment; by (to their ends) Perverting, what he piously intends. Let this be well observ'd: for, GOD doth yet Their Prosecutions hitherto permit But for Probation onely, that he may Try, who will turn to him; who fall away; Who, will unto his Covenant adhere; VVho, for preferment, profit, or for fear, VVill wave the same; how far forth those Pretenders VVill active be; and hovv far their Defenders VVill patronize them; that those things vvhich are Yet doubtful, may undoubtedly appear; That, those Plants which GOD planted may bear fruit, Those vvhich he planted not, be rooted out; And that cost may no longer be bestovvn On fruitless plants vvhich he did never ovvn: Such is the Prelacy, vvhich did proceed From mixture both of good and evil seed; As may declar'd by their Extraction be; For, this appears to be their Pedigree. Not very long time, after Noahs Flood, When old Idolatries began to brood, The forenam'd DRUIDES, who from the Oak VVhich they much rev'renced, their name first took, In these Parts of the world, usurp'd upon Mens Consciences (as many since have done) Ev'n in this Isle (if that which may be read In old Records be true) and being spread Into the neighb'ring Continent from hence In France next settling their chief residence, Did there, an uncontrouled power retain, Until the days of Claudius Cæsar's reign. The Flamin-Prelacy, which did begin Before that time; then by degrees did win Pre-eminence, and reverenced was, Till Pontificial-Prelacy took place: From that, the Papal Prelacy deriv'd Their being; and a Hierarchy contriv'd, Accommodated with a Discipline From Gentiles, Jews and Christians hetrogene: For, though compos'd of pieces patch'd together, From all these taken, it was like to neither. For, that the Christian Worship might not seem To be inglorious in the world's esteem; Or rather, that themselves advance they might Unto a princely and a pompous height In temporal Enjoyments, they took in Such Pageantries as had affected been By carnal Worshippers, with alteration In some things; and in some imitation: So, by degrees, they totally threw off That soberness and meekness, with a scoff, Which was in true sincerity profest, Before the birth and reign of Antichrist. The SPOUSE of CHRIST, because she did appear In out-side poor, though rich her Linings were, With disrespect they turned out of dore, And, in her stead, trimm'd up a painted Whore: So, meer will-worship was set up at last, And in the Throne of GOD, an Idol plac'd. From those, the Prelates came; and when these Nations Intended to reform their Innovations, A carnal Prudence, dreaming, that, if they, With their External Pomp, were took away, (Whereby some thought GOD's Worship was adorn'd) Religion and Devotion would be scorn'd; The Prelacy, upon that vain surmise, Was here continu'd in a new Disguise; Till that imposture was by Providence Made manifest; and then, it was from hence By GOD expel'd, as both dishonourable To him, and to his Church disserviceable; To those intending no affront at all, Whose Function simply is Episcopal. But, this Expulsion, being for our sin Revers'd, and Prelates now again brought in, That, and a Sacra-fames (in Excess) (Not thirst and hunger after righteousness) Hath so inrag'd them, that, they all devour, VVho fall within their new restored pow'r, VVith high contempt (at least without regard) Of what the KING hath gratioufiy declar'd. And those whom they of their Estates despoil, VVith insolent upbradings they revile, As meriting nor livelihood, nor place With them; and as uncapable of Grace From GOD or men: But, cry, Are not these they VVho lately took from Holy Church away Her Dowry? spoil'd GOD's Houses in the Land? On sacred things laid sacrilegious hand? And viliside his Servants? Thus, they crow: But, they injurious are, in doing so; And have as much in their blasphemings sail'd, As cursed Rabshakeh did, when he rail'd, On Hezekiah: for, GOD, did not own Those Altars or High-places overthrown, And then mis-called his; nor owneth he For Bishops, those who now so termed be; Nor those impertinent Appurtenances, VVhich Prelates please to term GOD's Ordinances. And, though they should, when they see Babel's fall, Their dreadful howlings, and their weepings call The Churches sighs and tears; no whit availing To them, would be their howling and bewailing. And, And, though some think this constitution brings Advantage to the Thrones of lawful Kings, 'Twill prove, when thereinto they better look, It strengthens them, as Ivy doth an Oak; And, that, of Men, no one sort under Heaven, Cause and Occasions have so often given, Of private Quarrels, Discords and Debates, And Wars, 'twixt Realms and Nations, Kings and States. The SHEPHERD therefore, hopes this will by those VVho can distinguish between Doves and Crows, Consider'd be; and manifest it then, That, greatest Clerks, are not the wisest men; Or, that, wise men through Avarice and Pride, By wealth and honour, may be led aside. And, though this hope should fail him in the main, It will not altogether be in vain; But, for the present, shall at least suffice To feed that part which upon Smoke relies, Till with essential nourishment suppli'd By that, which GOD hereafter will provide. Yea, though this charming should not prove so strong, To fetch back that which doth to him belong, Thenceforth, content, his Ewe and Lambs, and he, To live upon the Commons then will be, However, other hopes may have success, His best hopes will be rather more then less: For, they are built on him, who best can judge 'Twixt what is, and what is not Sacrilege; And if his Judges partially shall deal, From them, to that great JUDGE he will appeal. VVho cannot be deceiv'd. But no distrust Hath he of their Uprightness, who here must Be Judges in his Cause: for, they have seen VVhat did befal them who unjust have been; And hereby now, though he be much pre-judg'd, May know what on his part may be alleag'd. That which is claim'd, GOD will perhaps divide Betwixt both Parties when their Claims are tride: For, out of that which they erewhile possest, The Prelates for their sins were justly cast: The Shepherd was for his expelled too, By him, whose just doom he submits unto; As therefore GOD shall please he is content To share in Mercy and in Chastisement, Till he unto that Heritage is brought, Which at anothers cost, for him, was bought; And whereto, he vouchsafes him by his Grace A better Title, in a better place. If all be judg'd, which he hath purchas'd here The Prelates due; he'll take his portion there; For, though it be a little delaid, 'Twill prove the better share, and be well paid. This, is the Shepherds Case, and this the Course He means to take: pray, use him ne'er the worse: For, he had not exprest it in this mode, But that the Cov'nant PRELATES to explode, He conscientiously adheres unto And dares not sleight the same, as others do; Because, he can discern Truths from Delusions, And knows their late Re-entries, are Intrusions.

      <field name="fulltext">SIXTH COLLECTION Fragmenta Prophetica. OR, THE REMAINS OF GEORGE WITHER, Esq; BEING A Collection of the several Predictions, dispers'd throughout his Works. Some verified in the Author's life-time; many yet unfulfill'd, the Accomplishment whereof seem very probable. The last Work of the Author, and collected by his own hand a little before his death. A prudent man foreseeth the evil. PROV. 22. 3. A PREFACE to the following REVIEW, offering somewhat therewith considerable. [GOD's Promises and Threatnings, unto all] GOD's Promises and Threatnings, unto all Predicted are, with a Conditional Express or Tacit; and (although they seem Pronounced absolutely, at some time) May be reversible according to Our Faith, and acting what we ought to do: For, we are taught by many Presidents, That, like Proceedings will have like events, Till somewhat interveneth to dispense Judgment and Mercy with a difference. Most part of what this Author did predict, Hath variously already took effect: And, if ought is deferred, or abated, Of that which was by him prognosticated Against this Generation, or this Place, 'Tis meerly an effect of GOD's free-grace, By him vouchsafed, for their sakes, by whom A seed must be preserv'd till he shall come, Whose coming, &amp; whose reign will put an end To all their sufferings, who for him attend In faithful patience, and he will enable To bear mean while, what seems intolerable. [Though Lot a while in Zoar stai'd] Though Lot a while in Zoar stai'd, There long to abide he was afraid; And many now begin to fear There will be little safety here; Because they see, hear and believe What makes them both to fear and grieve. Yet, in his place let each man stay Until God calleth him away, By straitning of his path-wayes here, Or, by enlarging them elsewhere. And, let him careful be, that whither He moves, he bears not our sinnes thither; For, to what place soe're we go, The same sinns bring the same Plagues too. And, there is means of saving-Grace For Penitents, in ev'ry place. A Review of Neglected Remembrances. Being a Breviate of the most considerable Remembrances and Predictions dispersed in the Books hereafter specified, and published at several times, upon such various Occasions as inclined the Author to those Prophetical Expressions. An Interjection, occasioned by a sudden Ejaculation, whilst this Review of Neglected Remembrances was transcribing; which shall here stand inserted, thought it be no part of what was heretofore expressed, or intended to be hereunto added. Alas! in this Review, to what good end My words, my time and labour thus to spend Am I enforc'd? Why am I troublesome To others and my self, of things to come Or past, still to make mention? since I see Nor Judgments, whereof sensible men be (From day to day) nor Mercies, which betwixt Those Judgments intervene, or intermixt, Much heeded are? although they such have been, As are not in one Age or Place oft seen. Oh Times! Oh Manners! how far wil these Nations Proceed at last in their Prevarications, If GOD thereto a bounder shall not set, And they seek him no more then they do yet? Our Posture at this present is the same With Isr'els when they forth from Egypt came. Two Mountains on both sides of them they had, O're which no pass in safety could be made; Before them was a Sea, where Ship or Boat To waft them over, could not then be got. Behind them, Pharoah with a dreadful Host Pursu'de them, to recover what was lost, And to reduce them to that servile state, Which they were hopeful had been out of date; Or to destroy them quite, where did appear No likely hope of a Deliverer: For means of safety they could none espye, Within the prospect of a carnal eye. They, thus affrighted, to the LORD then cri'de, Not as they should, who do in him confi'de; But with more fear then faith; nay, worse then so, They murmur'd, and upbraided Moses too, In an uncivil and ingrateful mode, As if without a warranty from GOD He had imprudently pursu'd a course Which they foresaw, and told him would make worse Their bad Condition; yea, exprest a will, Slaves (as they had been) to continue still. Yet he (the meekest person who then liv'd) As if he neither at that time perceiv'd How him they injur'd; or how justly they Deserv'd what seemed probable that day, (Or how much base, unmanly slavishness Their own tongues did apparently express) He wav'd their murmurs, whilst they were afraid, As if nought had amiss by them been said: And, like a loving Father, speaking to His Children, (knowing not when they mis-do) Said gently thus: Fear not, stand still and see With patience, how ye shall deliver'd be: For these Egyptians who are now before Your eyes this day, shall never fright you more: And so befel it; for next morn they saw Their foes lye dead, of whom they stood in awe, Drown'd by the waves, and on that Sea-shore cast, Through which they dry-shod, and in safety past. Yet both that, with those Mercies which before GOD had vouchsaf'd (with very many more Soon after) seemed to be so forgot, As if they them, or him regarded not. Now at this present time such is our case, We are beleaguer'd as that People was; With hazards upon every side confin'de; With dangers both before us, and behind; Not onely having many Foreign Foes, But some likewise at home as bad as those; And, worse within us also, who have brought us To greater streights then all our Foes without us. Those Jews we parallel in ev'ry thing, Who injur'd Moses by their murmuring: And, are as thankless unto GOD, who hath Here acted, both in Mercy and in Wrath, As many Wonders as by him were shown In Egypt when King Pharoh was o'rethrown; (Though they appear not such unto their sence, Who shut the eyes of their Intelligence) We as distrustful are as they, as giddy In ev'ry Tryal too; we are as ready To make a Golden Calf, and to prefer That Idol before our Deliverer. As much as they, we long to repossess The Flesh-pots of our Lusts, our Slavishness, (Which we did cry to be deliver'd from) As soon as into any streight we come. Yet, GOD hath been to us (and at this time) Continues the same GOD he was to them. Though their example, which should make us better, Hath made our Provocations much the greater, He with us dealeth, as a Father mild, Whose heart is grieved by a froward Child; And, as he did with stubborn Ephraim When Anger and Compassion moved him To cry out thus, What shall I do to thee? For at a stand with us he seems to be, Both by his frequently himself estranging, And by his oft returning, and oft changing His Judgments and his Mercies, that we may Be changed, and reform our crooked way. We have this day (though in another mode) The daily Presence of our gracious GOD To lead us through that Wilderness of Sin In which we have a long time wandring been: He guides, guards, and provideth us Supplies In all our wants, (though in another wise) And is with us as wonderfully here, As when his People brought from Egypt were. The self-same Cloud and Pillar we have had, (Though varied) and, as effectual made To all intents and purposes, as they Then had; and to refresh us in the way Unto the Land of Rest, we have that Rock Whereof they drank, unto that purpose broke: And, though we oft stray, shall to what we tend Attain, when we are at our Journeys end; If we believe, and persevere to do So much as GOD enableth us unto. For, he requireth not from any one A scruple more then may by him be done; Nor doth expect from any to receive More then what he at first, or last shall give; Because of all omissions and mis-actions, He hath in full accepted satisfactions By his Deservings, who secure us may From whatsoever Debts we cannot pay; If on his Mediation we depend, With Faith and Penitence at our lives end; That Mark retaining, which distinguisheth Christs chosen Sheep from Goats, in Life and Death; To wit, that love to him, and to each other, Which knits for ever, GOD and Man together. This is that everlasting Gospel which We were foretold, an Angel was to preach To ev'ry Kindred, People, Tongue and Nation Throughout the earth to bring men to Salvation: And, for a preparation thereunto, He cry'd aloud, (as all true Prophets do) Fear God; to Him, and to the Lamb give praise, For now the hour is come, (these are the dayes) Wherein his Judgments must be pour'd on them Who shall not glorifie and worship him By whom Heaven, Earth, the Fountains &amp; the Seas Created were, and ev'ry thing in these. The fear of God is that which first lets in True Wisdom; that brings Penitence for sin: By these within the heart of man is wrought Such Faith and Grace, that they then taking root, Do seasonably bring forth such blessed fruit, As by degrees destroys the thorns and weeds Which either choak or starve the holy Seeds, From whence the means of those enjoyments springs Whereof to us that Gospel tydings brings. This method long ago was practised By John the Baptist, when he ushered Christ and his Everlasting Gospel in, By preaching of true penitence for sin: And thereby did prepare before his face, The way intended, to soul-saving Grace. Such Consequents, as promis'd are to spring From Christ and his Apostles publishing This Gospel (whether it shall come abroad As preached in the ordinary mode, Or by the Holy Ghost, which oft conveighs The same by extraordinary wayes) Are without fail to them vouchsaf'd for ever, Who entertaine it; and shall still endeavour Conformity, sincerely, that to do Which Grace and Nature them inables to. But everlastingly it shall not be Preacht in this World: For this believe must we, That his Commission, who Authorized Those men, by whom it was first published, Is nigh expir'd; and that it shall not last One minute longer, when that date is past; Which will be in that Moment wherein all Shall die, or changed be; but sooner shall Be so to them, who summon'd are away By Death, before that Grand Assizes day. If it be so, let us take timely heed What Doctrine thence, doth by result proceed: For Christ himself, is he who did predict The Judgments which we both feel and expect. He is that Angel in a Mystery, Who through the midst of the Heavens did flye. Twas he, whom 'twixt the Heavens of the Law And Gospel many Prophets flying saw, To bring the News and Means to every Nation Of Peace on Earth, by reconciliation 'Twixt GOD and Man. We have already seen, Some of those Tokens, which foretold have been, To signifie to us the General Doom, That should soon after their appearance come; And should they be commemorated here. It very evidently would appear, That hitherward it speedily advances To them who heed well the known Circumstances In GOD's and humane Actings. He hath pour'd The Viols forth, whereby some are devour'd, And some tormented; yet, most men grow more Blasphemous, and more wicked then before. And had we no sign else to predeclare The sounding of the Seventh Trump, is near, Save that, and those Divisions, which of late Republicks, Realms and Persons separate From others, and themselves; we need not shew Another Symptome of what will ensue. To hasten such Dooms (among other Crimes Which are predominant in these our times) One I have seen reiterated here With impudence in publick ev'ry year, Which will not go unpunish'd, though the Nation Hath entertain'd it with much veneration: But I have yet no warrant to declare it, And therefore till I have so, will forbear it. With these, there is likewise one special Sign Concurrent, mention'd in Records Divine, (Not least considerable) 'tis a defection By wanting of that Natural affection Which constitutes the Manhood; for that sin Doth to be Epidemieal begin; Yea, ev'n the natural Act of Generation, Which was ordained for our preservation, So is corrupted into an excess Of brutish Lustings, beyond beastliness, And filthiness, grown up to such a height, That many in their sins take less delight Except they lawlesly be carried on, And shall be likewise impudently done. To which end, ev'n our honest Recreations Are lately scandalized by these Nations, And oft abused; yea, the Tunes and Songs Which to a sober merriment belongs, Are so estranged now from what they were In former times, (and within Sixty year) That in my apprehension there doth seem So vast a diffrence betwixt these and them, As 'twixt the croakings of a Ravens throat, And Linnets, or a Nightingales clear note. Which unto me appeareth to portend Our pleasant things are drawing to an end; And, that our sins, and their deserved doom Are now almost to their last period come. One Sign more I will add unto those many Foremention'd, which as signal is as any: Some of the true Christ do begin to doubt, And where to find another, hunt about; Not wanting such as will be undertaking To bring them unto one of their own making. Thus much, as I believe, his words implies, Who said false Christs and Prophets should arise In latter times; for I have in my dayes Seen that to be fulfilled many wayes. The greatest number Christians now profest, Send one another unto Antichrist, And say that's he: In Turky at this day, He is expected, (as reports do say.) And many last year were in expectation To hear thereof, ere now, a confirmation. And I, because I credit not that Fame, A man of little Faith reputed am. Some confidently tell us he is here, To wit, in this Church whereof now we are; And, so I hope, although it may be thought We have not entertain'd him as we ought; Nor are so charitable unto them, Who conscientiously do worship him. Some say, he's there, in such or such a place Wherein a secret Meeting is, or was; Some other send men to the Wilderness, Affirming he is there; perhaps by this Intruding, that he by the Humane Creature, May found be in his own wild until'd Nature: But this believe not, for till thither he Comes of himself, found there he cannot be, Nor any where, save where that Love resides Which doth expel that self-love which divides His Flocks, and causeth men no care to take Those breaches to repair, which Pride doth make. Not many take into consideration How to improve aright this Visitation; They do both good and evil things mis-name, The wicked they acquit, the righteous blame; Their Interests sometimes confound together, To th'one sometimes apply what's due to th'other. And, as the Jews (their type) did justifie Themselves in acting that Impiety For which they are corrected; we begin To say, like them, the troubles we are in, And loss of all the good things now bereft, Befall us onely because we had left Such Idolizings, as when Spice-Cakes given For an Oblation to the Queen of Heaven, By them omitted were. Such thoughts have we Of GOD, and of those Judgments which now be On us inflicted; yea, their parallel We are in all, wherein they did not well. I am not able to enumerate The many wayes whereby we separate From one another; nor dare say how few Go right, if there be but one way that's true. Nor know how to be safe, unless there were As well a preaching to the heart, as ear: For, most what now proceeding from the mouth Is, only counter-pleadings between Truth And error; which both sides, to fortifie With so much confidency do applie The words or meanings of Gods holy writ, That, had we no way to ascertain it But these, or those men, or my yea or no, None could know what they should believe or do. For, as well Supream Powers as private men Are Patrons of gross errors now and then; And by Authority that is supprest Which was by like Authority profest. With ev'ry windy Doctrine flur'd about, Some are not half so zealously devout And resolute professors of what's true, As of what is Heretical and New: And others oldest and sound Truths condemn, Because they are but Novelties to them. Some term all those Phanaticks who dissent From them in Judgment, although innocent. Some call them Saints and Martyrs, who by some Are judg'd the cause of all the Plagues now come. The Romanists, unto our Separation From them, ascribe this present Visitation. Some others say, it is our toleration Of their Idolatries, which plagues this Nation. Some to entrenching on mens Consciences Impute it. Some to our tolerating these. Some to expelling of the Hi'rachy: Some to suppressing the Presbytery. Some to Rebellious actings against Kings; Some other unto quite contrary things. And the result of all summ'd up together, Is this, Each shifts his guilt off to another. But, GOD before the Round hath wheel'd about, Will find the principal Offenders out, Either while time runs on, or, when he shall To universal Judgment summon all. That which should have two feet to stand upon, We cripple, by allowing it but one: Some zealous are for Temples built with stones; Some for those spiritualiz'd in flesh and bones. Some are for Conquests by the Temp'ral Sword; Some to be Victors by the Two-edged Word. Some look for Christ in that Jerusalem Which was in Palestine; and some for him (In that Jerusalem which doth descend From Heaven) do in Faith and Hope attend: And, too too often also, they who be At union in their Judgments, disagree So long (for By-ends) timely to improve Their knowledg, faith and works, by Christian Love, That in all, whereby they to merit thought, Their Labour's lost, and all for which they wrought, Delusions now so many are, and such In these last times, that they endanger much Ev'n GOD's Elect; and do presignifie The day of Vengeance is approaching nigh: And partly seems to be charactared By what the best men hope, and worst men dread. However, let no soul despair that hath Sad apprehensions of the day of Wrath; By this, or what in my Review you find Conditionally predicted, to remind What was neglected; for, among us here Christ's everlasting Gospel to our ear Is preached yet; and, not yet is the day Of Reconcilement passed quite away. Come, let us therefore, ere it shall grow dark, To scape the Storm and Fire, flye to th'Ark Which hath been slighted; there is yet a place For Mercy, and an open door for Grace. When Penitence brings Reformation in, It makes a Blessing, what a Plague had been: Yea, then 'twill to her future weal be turn'd, That this great City was to ashes burn'd: She Phœnix-like, shall gloriously arise Out of that Rubbish wherein now she lies; And I, which now am disrespected here, Shall have a Monument erected there. GOD all advantages to save us, takes, Forsaketh none, till him he first forsakes; Made not one man (though some so please to say) To be a sinner or a cast-away: But all in love, that they might be by him Possessed with delight, and he by them. For, when the sin of one had all destroy'd, That his Love should not thereby be made void, He to redeem them gave his onely Son, Who ransom'd all again, excepting none. Still by his actings in the dispensation Of Judgments and of Mercies to this Nation, (Ev'n by the late Plague of devouring fire) He manifests, that he doth not desire Our total Ruine; but, takes all occasions Allow'd by Justice, for our preservations: And though ours sins as red as Scarlet show, He can and will make us as white us snow, If we repent them; or, if we but would Endeavour it so far forth as we could: For, he in sinners deaths takes no delight, Or, any without cause to grieve or smite: But in pure love dispenseth his correction, To bring our happiness unto perfection. This is my Creed, which should I not confess To glorifie GOD's Love and Righteousness, (When by occasions thereto mov'd I am, That others may likewise believe the same) I merited to be shut out from those To whom GOD everlasting Mercy shows: For, could we see, or apprehend how near He standeth, when far off he doth appear, Co-operating for, and with us too, (In that which for our selves we cannot do) We would more love then fear him (though his blows Are very sharp) since intents by those, Is hammering the self-love of the Creature Into the Will and Temper of his Nature, To make true Union, which till then, will be Impossible; for, nothing can agree With ought so perfectly as to unite, When diametrically opposite, As those two Natures be; because the other Th'one would destroy, if till then knit together. Repine not therefore, at what GOD shall do, What ere it be; but willingly thereto Submit your selves, and heartily repent Your Provocations. Let us all lament, Not thereto frighted by a slavish fear (Of Judgments which now felt or threatned are By this Review) but in pure love to him Whose Mercy saves, when Justice might condemn; And persevereth to redintegrate By Love, ev'n those who persever'd in Hate. Do thus, and then the Judgments which in part Now executing are, GOD will divert. Repent what you have done, and he will too Repent of what he threatned hath to do. For such Repentance well consists with that Immutability which doth relate Unto the Deity; and will accord With Attributes ascribed in his Word. Yea, though from my Predictions you scape free, I shall then counted a true Prophet be, And this my Interjection will appear Not so improperly inserted here, As I my self suppos'd, when 'twas begun, It would appear to many, being done: For, till I had compos'd what here is pen'd, I knew not all whereto it might extend; Nor know I yet: and therefore I do leave it To such effects as GOD shall please to give it. But how my soul! how came it so to pass, That this Ejaculation, with Alas, (And with sad Musings) was begun at first? Since thou dost know, that when things are at worst, GOD then comes in, and often doth repair Our Breaches, when brought near unto despair? The Aid delay'd a while, he brings at length, (Ev'n when we have no likely means, or strength To help our selves) why then shouldst thou be sad, Who frequently experiments hast had That Mercy hath to thee been more then doubled, When others thought thee most extreamly troubled Thou wert vouchsaf'd the greatest inward Rest, When in thy Body thou seem'dst most opprest; And to be kept unharmed in the flame, Is more then preservation from the same. Then what thou hast perswaded others to, Continue (as thou hast profest) to do: In what GOD's glory may advance, persever; Depend on him; be pleas'd with whatsoever He either shall permit, or hath decreed, And to discharge thy Conscience still proceed, Not fearing that thy labour or thy cost In doing of thy Duty, will be lost: For fully recompens'd thy pains would be, Though thou shouldst edifie but two or three. The World, the Devil, yea mine own flesh too (Offended much with what I say or do) Conspire together, and Confederates be Both to discourage and disparage me; Pretending they have somewhat to produce, To prove me blamable without excuse: (And may destroy me, if nought intervene, To bar the prosecuting what they mean) Yet I defie them both to act and say The worst they either would effect, or may; For, though they find me many grains too light, I have a white Stone that will make up weight, And such a Friend as hath on me bestown A Righteousness more perfect then mine own. He cheers me with assurance that he will To me what he hath been, continue still; By GOD's free-gift this hope, this faith I have, And they will send me safe beyond my Grave. A THANKFUL RETRIBUTION, Imprinted 1649. This poem is not extant in its original form. This was written to express the Author's gratitude to some few Members of Parliament, who without his seeking, had propounded an expedient whereby to satisfie his just Demands; but being without effect, that which was neglected, is here again revived, as pertinent to consideration at this time. Though Wishes are but words, Thanks are no more; And my oppressions make me not so poor, But that I have yet Thanks enough to pay For Fifty thousand Wishes in one day; And I much thank you ? Page the Second. But truly I expect not yet to see The World neglect her own, to think on me; Nor do I ought for my advantage crave, Whereby the Publick may disprofit have: I rather wish, That what is truly known By Service and by Grant to be mine own, Might be confer'd, or means at least, whereby My Labours might support my Family Till I receiv'd my dues. For that would please My longing more, then all those Offices Which others covet, and wherein few can At once grow rich, and be an honest man; And, wherein (as Affairs are manag'd now) He that would fain be honest, knows not how. I value not my self so high, to set My heart on what I am not like to get: No, nor so low, but that (if I had wings To reach them) I would flye at th'highest things Your House could give me, or the world could show me, Yet set them at a distance far below me: For, he who of himself esteem shall make By those things which the World may give or take, (Or he who by his Trappings, or his Place Doth prize himself) his Manhood doth debase. If I well know my heart, I seek no more Of this Worlds Honour, or of her vast store, Then what sufficeth to defray the Debts, Which Duty and Necessity now sets Upon me; or which may yeeld means to do Those Works which GOD may seem to call me to, And keep up that frail part of me which dyes Or lives unactive, without due supplies. Yet when I did perceive with what disdain Some did your friendly motion entertain, And how they jeer'd thereat, it tempted me To wish your Motion might vouchsafed be, That I might see how mad the Fools would grow With Envy, if they liv'd to see it so. One said the Place was fitter to reward A Member of your House; and it appear'd Thereby to me, that he had quite forgot (As others do) the Self-denying Vote. Some seem to think, that seeing I am poor, (Whate're they owe me) they should give no more Then sutes my present Fortune; as if I With my Estate had lost my Dignity, And he had got it, who since t'other day Is grown Sub-Grandee from a beggar-boy, By such an Occupation, as hath yet Neither improv'd his Honesty or Wit: But, let these make the best of their New Lot, So mine they wrong not, I envy them not; And, 'tis my honour, rather then my shame, Now to be poor; because I poor became Not by mine own default; and in a time When to be very rich, implies a crime. For, who with honour to great Wealth can rise, When all the Land is full of poor mens cries? Or, what shame thereby him can seise upon, Who wants, when Kings and Kingdoms are undone? Or poor became, because he lent and gave His whole Estate the Neighbourhood to save? And what at last will unto such succeed, Who, when they may, relieve not that mans need? I covet not the Place propos'd for me, (Although as capable thereof as he Who did possess it) for, I know too well Wherein that man his Neighbours must excel, Who hath an aim so high, except there shall Some extraordinary Change befall: And, me (I think) it would advance no more Then did that Office I held heretofore. For, in these Isles I have already had A Place more honourable (though not made So much account of) then 'tis to supply The greatest Office in your Chancery. Yea, more then to possess the place of him Who in that Court is Officer Supream. And as a mark of Honour, bears about A Silver Seal in an Embroidered Clout. I have been honour'd to draw up Records For him that's King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; To be unto this Isle Remembrancer, And, as it were, a Publick Register To that Supream, High and most awful Court From whence proceeds no Sentence, no Report, No Order or Injunction, no Decree, Edicts or Dooms, but such as Righteous be; And where the Judg will to no side be sway'd By Eloquence, or Force, or brib'd, or pray'd To be more merciful, or more severe Then Justice and true Clemency may bear. Yea, although at this present heeded not By many, (and by others quite forgot) I have enroll'd, and registred to stand Upon Record, what Mercies to this Land Have been vouchsaf'd; what ought to have bin done To keep away the Judgments coming on: Shown how the King, and how the People might Have scap't the hands which both of them now smite: Foretold the War before it came to pass; Who should begin the Quarrel in this place: What sad Effects would follow; what regard My words would find, how they should me reward, With many other things, which will appear In those Records, whilst men speak English here: And thousands will in future time confess Those things fulfill'd which I did fore-express, Who shall, it may be, likewise live to see, That GOD observes who have abused me. For hitherto, though I despis'd appear, He spares my life, upholds my Spirit here; Feeds me by his own hand, sometimes by men, By Ravens and by Angels now and then. Twice when my pow'rful Foes had by their might Deprived me of my Subsistance quite, He did supply my wants when I nor knew Nor thought how Oyl or Meal I could renew; Against proud Prelates, and corrupted Peers, He did maintain about me many years A Watchful Guard, which kept me from their Pow'r When me they did endeavour to devour; And from my troubles did release me too, By doing what some thought would me undo: Yea, when the greatest Lyon loudly roar'd, And rouz'd against me; when the bloudy Sword Was drawn upon me; when a Poysonous Pest Breaths killing Vapours; when I was opprest On ev'ry side; and when I was forsook Well nigh of all, GOD notice of me took; Sav'd me from spoil, from slaughter, from infection, And honor'd me, ev'n by his own protection. This being so, my Scorners whom I hear At your Proposal do both grudg and jeer, Have no such cause (as their misdeemings may Suppose they had) your motion to gain-say: 'Twas fear, perhaps, I might have made the Place Henceforth less profitable then it was. For if that Register shall conscience make At ev'ry Hearing such true Notes to take Of what is Order'd, and so careful be, To draw up ev'ry Sentence and Decree, As not to leave that doubtful which the Court Intrusts to his discretion and report, Ambiguous Orders would not so enlarge The Clients trouble, and his needless charge, Either by words too many, or too few, (Or of less weight then to the sense was due) New motions to beget, and thereupon New Orders, till both parties are undone. When to prevent this, due care shall be took, You will not so much for great Places look, To gratifie your Friends, as you will then To execute them, seek out fitting men. No Place will then be thought too good for those Who for your sakeshave made their friends their foes They shall then get, at least their own again, Who hitherto have spent themselves in vain; And out of zeal unto the Common Good, Adventur'd Liberty, Estates and Bloud, Whilst others (by their patience, cost and sweat) Grow, to their Countreys damage, Rich and Great. Then they who have been innocently wise, Will see in what their Wealth and safety lies; And, then it may be, some fair Lot among My Brethren, will befall me short or long. When such a Change I find, I shall begin To doubt almost, what Climate I am in. I shall not, for a good space after, take The boldness to profess I am awake, Or, that a Reformation in hath crept, Whilst I was either in the dark, or slept; And shall of our distractions hope to see A better end, then likely now to be. Then those things which we yet hear and behold With fear and sorrow, shall with joy be told; And then shall I no whit displeased grow, Whether I sit higher, or more low; Or, whether they who me should think upon, Give me that Office, or a worse, or none. For whatsoe're befalls, I shall be fed, And so shall mine, whilst other men have bread. From your well-wishings these expressions flow; From these perhaps another fruit may grow; From that another, and from those again Another, till your wishes you obtain, And our Endeavours (though what we intend, Succeed not) shall be prosperous in the end. BONI OMINIS VOTUM: Imprinted 1656. This (as a Symptome of a Good omen) was occasioned by the summoning of Extraordinary Grand Juries out of the eminent Baronets, Knights, Esquires and Gentlemen, to serve in their respective Counties, at the Summer Assizes 1656, which because it offers what is fit to be considered and remembred, (and is also very short) shall be here inserted without Abreviation. Good speed to this Republick, and encrease Of Happiness to those who seek her Peace. Sad things are threatned, and a lowring Skye Seems to portend great storms are drawing nigh: But look above them, and good courage take, The Sun still shines, although the Clouds be black, And beamings through their darkest parts appear, Whereby discernable Good Omens are, With symptoms of the Blessing we expect, If we our selves obstruct not their effect, And turn them to ill signs; which to prevent, That which yet follows gives a needful hint. As both abroad and here within this Land, Publick and private mens affairs now stand, This Year is likely to be Critical, About the time in which the leaves will fall; And if Conjectures may be builded on, We from what's acted, with what's left undone, Spell'd both together, somewhat may deduce To teach us what ere long will be in use. Whether it were the Policy of some In hope it an obstruction might become To Concord; or the Prudence of the Shrieve, Or Special Providence, which did contrive By those Grand Juries so to represent Their Counties, we shall best know by th'event: For, whether chearfully they meet and do That Service which their Call invites them to; Or, by a wilful Non-appearance, wave That duty which the Common Cause doth crave, It will be signal; and to many one A Test, as virtual as the Lydian Stone: And, likewise give an Intellectual View Of some Result, which thereon will ensue At their next Meeting, who to represent This Nation, shall be by Election sent. For those Grand Jurors are now chosen forth Of them, whose Gifts, Estates, Degree or Birth, Hath rankt them with the best; yea out of those (Excepting onely open active Foes To this Republick) who have been suspected Meer Neuters, or else persons disaffected, As well as from among them, whose true zeal Hath kept them constant to this Commonweal, That they who heartily well minded are, Themselves henceforward some way might endear Thereto; and thereby for the future stand Enroll'd among the Patriots of this Land: Endow'd with all their Liberties, and freed From those Distinguishments which either breed Or nourish secret hatred, to th'encrease Of Quarrels, and diminishment of Peace. And who can tell what Providence by these (Though diffring in their Judgments) will now please To make Effectual for the preservation Or settlement of Peace throughout this Nation, When things are acted by a moderate Expostulation, in a joint Debate? Where ev'ry one may freely speak his thought, And when it is consid'red as it ought, That no man can of safety be assur'd, Until the Publick Safety be secur'd. We know, that diffring Simples put together, So qualifie and so correct each other, Though some are poysonous) that they purge away Malignant Humours, which would else destroy The life of man; so they who formerly Did in their singular Capacity And private Judgments, sometimes act or speak What did at least endanger, if not break The Common Peace; may when they gath'red are Into one fellowship, be helpful there To benefit their Countrey ten times more Then they have been, or could be heretofore. Yea, as the fat Lime, and the barren Sand When they well mixed are, do make a band To bind together rough or hewed stone, (Which neither of them could have done alone) Ev'n so by them who are Dissenters now, Our Publick Buildings may the firmer grow, When they into One Structure shall be fixt, Well qualifi'd, and rationally mixt. This peradventure may some good presage To them who are convened to engage Within a higher Orb, or shortly must Become our Trustees in a greater Trust: For he who hath consid'red it, believes That if those Petty Representatives, By loving Prudence, shall prepare a way Thereto (as in good likelihood they may) That Nobler Body, which to its perfection Are (for the most part) rais'd by their Election, Might be so modaliz'd, and temper'd so, That Discords into Sympathies would grow, And all our Fears and Dangers in the close Quite vanish, to the terror of our Foes. It may be thus, and will be thus, if yet Mens Wilfulness hath left them any Wit: For, why should they who now may be at rest, Run hazards to advance their Interest, Whom nothing else, can satisfie but Pow'r, All others at their pleasure to devour? And spoilers of their own Estates become, To make a Fortune for they know not whom? Or seek to have that Game afresh begun, By which all may be lost, and nothing won? I hope they shall be wiser, and that we In this Expedient shall so wary be, That whatsoever others may intend, We shall endeavour to promote that End We ought to prosecute; and at the last Our Anchor in a peaceful Harbour cast. I wish it heartily; and (since I see Wishings are vain where no endeavours be) That, those whom it concerns, provoke I may To seek this blessing, and to help make way To that I wish for, I compos'd this Spell; Let him who mov'd me to it, speed it well; And make it so consider'd by this Nation (Before things grow beyond consideration) That Words which to their safety do pertain, May not be alwayes spoke to them in vain; For they are fools who still pursue a Course Which makes a sickly being to be worse: And they are also little less then mad, Who would exchange a good one for a bad: Or put in hazard a possessed Lot, In hope to get what never can be got. A Si quis, or Queries, with other Verses annexed. Imprinted in the Year 1648. These Verses next following, were upon the same Occassion presented to several Members of the House of Commons, repairing thither the 23d of December 1648, being the next day after their Humiliation, with an Imprinted Petition thereto annexed. They who at Rich mens thresholds begging lye, (Though long neglected) wil prolong their cry Till they an answer get, and so will I. I know it is not Eight and thirty year Since first I was an humble Suiter here; And yet to me it seems as if it were. Dayes, Months and Years I sadly waiting stand, Yet no man speaks a Word, none lends a Hand To help me, though but Justice I demand. And therefore, such as know me, and my Case, Observe it to the scandal of that Place, Whose guilt I blush for, as my own disgrace. But now I hope the Pool which heretofore Cur'd some days none, or one, (and few days more) Is mov'd so, that one day will cure a score. And that he prosecutes not his Affairs Unseasonably, who to a Means repairs New sanctified, with Fastings and with Prayers. Excuse me then, that thus I do forelay, And (as it were) arrest you in the way Unto the House of Parliament this day. And (whatsoe're this morning is design'd To be debated there) some minutes find To hear that Prayer which is herewith join'd. Yea, spare a little time to do him right, Who (having serv'd you with a heart upright) Seeks but his own, that you enjoy it might. For, 'tis a loss to you, that he or they Who could, and did for you lend, give and pay, Should scarce have bread sufficient for the day. And 'tis to your dishonour too, that such Who to secure you, Goods nor Lives did grutch, Should want, whilst your betrayers are grown rich. If you in your Grand Work the worse succed For doing of this Charitable deed, Leave me hereafter quite out of your Creed. Or, if they long thrive, who as heretofore Shall still defer to hear and help the poor, Kick me and my Petitions out of door. 'Tis now within your Walls, and I expect It will be there this day with good effect, Though some should think it merited neglect. For, of that Crisis 'twill a ground-work be, Whereby I shall undoubtingly foresee, What will become of other men and me. Things present at some points of time foreshew Things future; and unless mistake I do, That which this day produceth, will do so.</field>
