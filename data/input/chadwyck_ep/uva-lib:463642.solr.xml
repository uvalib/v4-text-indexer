Ye sacred nymphs whose steps do trace with fleres too and fro, Ye sisters fayre whose princely grace to bathing Fountes doe go. Assist and ayde the slender minde, whose earnest will is bent By painefull toyle to him assignd your fansie to content. Mineruaes Lampe, dame Pallas cleare or Tritons touch stone true Exile from breast all childish feare, with wisedome mee indue, To breath and blast in thundring verse such dainties as be rare, Or iunckets fine, such to rehearse, as Stewardes few prepare. Condect with pearle, adornd with stone, inuironed with Golde: A blasing Glasse to looke vpon, or pleasaunt to beholde, Direct Thalia quiuering quill, Sicelides come nie Ye ternall sisters (if ye will,) assist me to replie. Guide trembling ioyntes, guid fansie free, to shewe hir simple skill, And PhÅbus chiefe helpe speedely, my promise to fulfill. So shall I passe, this toyling clogge, and finish your desire, Soe shall I scape the lothsom logge, and vnto ioyes aspire. Come neere, we yeld to thy request, ?And? graunted shall it bee. I thanke ye dames that your behest, vouchsafes to pleasure mee. I greet you all farewell a whyle, I thanke you euerichone, This friendly Banquet to compyle, my selfe shall take vpon. FINIS. Demosthenes the Mayster of the Banquet, Sosia his Stewarde. [Demosthenes] Friend Sosia listen and attend, what newes I shall relate, To this my phrase this audit tend, and marke thereof the state. I haue decreed for to conuiue, the muses euerie one, With daintie meates, but first yle thriue my selfe to thee alone. I walking through the prate or greene, of Helicone that spring, These Lanterns bright did vew a queene, hir mate a princely King. He deckt with flamed shyning beames, or brightnesse of the Sunne, And from hir eyes large siluer streames, supposed were to runne. The Queene the regall King did call, and termd him, PhÅbus bright, And after them ensewed all, the muses to my sight. Sicelides did formest trace, their robes as greene as grasse, And next Pyerides tooke place, as cleare as Christall glasse, Sicelides their scutchins bare, vpon their humers hie, Which wisedome seemed to declare, surmounting starrie skie. Ãtherion Globes or circuits rounde, Pyerides did holde, Contayning sciences profounde, be set with glistering Golde. These sights delited much my minde, so that I greedy was, With serious toyle the place to finde, through which their feete did passe In dumps I tended to and fro, the somits were obscure Yet last I pressed for to goe, where fansie did procure. And Fansie Fansie lyke did lead, to complish hir request, And brought me straight vnto a bed, where I did seeme to rest: So darke with pleasaunt Odours sweete, a pleasure for to smell, That sure I did suppose it meete, a season their to dwell. Thus fansie yelding to delight, I fell in slombring sleepe, And waking, dames with Torches bright, my corps did charely keepe. The one a fading Rose did beare, dame beautie was hir name: The other Fortune as you heare, a blynde and fickle dame With y? in Traunce my sprites were gast And Torchlight did amase My lyuely sences almost past, that staring I did gase. Scarse breathing breathles was my heart, and griefe did so assayle, That sure I doubted pinching dart, against me should auayle. Then of a sodaine, beauties Rose, was faded to the stalke, And Lady Fortune, with hir glose, constrayned was to walke. For on the wale fayre written was, O formose puer, nimiune crede colori. Cicero, paribus facilime congregantur. Alias, similes habent labra lactucas. that beautie is but vayne, Which adage as it came to passe, made beautie to refraine. Than likewise in an other place, dame Fortune was definde: With nipping cuts for to deface, hir pompe and loftie minde. Insculped briefe, if that the blinde, the blinde do seeme to lead, The prouerbe true needes must I finde, moe fooles are brought to bed. Thus winding not from midst my thrale, wherein I cheyned was, Into a princelie court or hall, by wandring, I did passe: The roufe whereof was Iuorie bone, the pillors beaten Golde, The windowes deckt with pearle &amp; stone, full costly to beholde. In midst whereof a Bath did spring, which did my heart inflame, So rather that than any thing, I would haue tast the same. Thus still desire did presse to proue, the thing it woulde attaine, And eke my greedie minde did moue, therein to take some paine. I faynted like a feble hound, and coueted to drinke, But yet the liquors did rebound, when lippes were at the brinke. Lyke Tantalus I had dispayre, which liues in dolefull payne, Who when the waters proch him fayre, they ebbe as fast agayne. Chastitas, Sapientia, Scientia.Thus gasing sometime here and there, in midst of all my griefe, Three Nymphes of sodaine did appeare, which did mee much reliefe. Sosia. My Leach if this be manifest, which you protest as true, I wonder much how you were blest, such wondrous sightes to vew, Spied you in middest of Christal streame, three Ladyes passing glee? I doubt your worship did but dreame, effigies such to see. Demost, If Titans Chariot chase the skie, throughout Auroraes race Then this as true none can denie, I was in present place. Sosia, Then by request might boldnesse craue, a pardon at your hande, With smiling face, &amp; countnance graue, their names to vnderstande. Demost. Relation made approch me nie, I graunt to thy request, And finall thus I doe replie, bicause I loue thee best. Dame Sapience, first, th? chasted Queene, possest the second rayne, And Lady Science to be seene, last peared verie plaine, Ech offered me a precious gift, most wondrous to beholde, But Science one my head did lift, a crowne of perfect Golde This done suche musicke did abounde, as gast my sences all. Soe that incontinent to grounde, in Traunce my corps did fall. Then at the latter pinch and eb, of this my mortall lyfe, When sisters black had shredde my web, I longed for a wyfe. The Muses hearing this my mone, consented vnto mee That verdit giuen of euery one, straight wedded shoulde I bee, Then, who coulde lyke mee shoulde mee haue, and whome I lykt agayne, This they decreed, to keepe from graue, the body nighe hand slayne. These golden darlings markt mee well, with fixed eyes so ryfe, And poynted Science last to dwell with mee, for terme of lyfe Content was pleasde, she gaue hir troth, I coupled fayth and hand, That whyle the ayre did feede vs both, hir husbande would I stande. Then leade we were in sacred wise, into the Temple sweete, Where Vesta by hir wonted guyse, did bath our tender feete. Thus were we married, know the case and this take by the way, My wedding Banquet in this place, I purpose here to day: Therefore such Cates as costly be, I charge thee to prepare, And thus much more attend to mee, three daintie dishes rare. Sosia. Farre set they say and dearely bought, fine daintrels doth delite, Nowe euery corner must be sought, to please their appetite I runne, I trace, I fiske and sette, I raunge from streete, to streete To kill with Hauke, or catch with nete, such wildfoule as I meete. Trudge Sosia, trudge, festine with speede, thy pillors doe prepare, But Lixa, see the hounds ye feede, against we course the Hare. I knowe not I, what Cates to buy, for dainties common be Such diuers meates, vnfainedly, as serueth ech degree. Demost. I pray thee zelously my friende, search out the verie best, For peerles dames I doe intend, shall be my poynted gest. Both Phessaunt, Plouer, Larke, &amp; Quail, with Rabbet, Succors yong, Of dainties these let me not fayle, with other rares among. As Marchpaine, Cheese &amp; Ginger greene, with sucket pleasaunt sweete, Blauncht Almondes, as in court is seene, for princely Ladyes, meete. Stewde Proynes, conserue of Cherries red, Peares, Biskets, Suger fine, With nectar dulce, since I am wedde, by voyce of Muses nine, Sosia. What Iunckets call ye these I pray, no dainties can they seeme, For vulgar sort from day to day, as common them esteeme. They serue as foode for to sustaine, the hungrie corps withall, So that the Nimphes from them refraine, as we refrayne from gall, For sacred powers of starrie skie, their natures doe consist, Hauing at pleasure pleasauntly, to bath them where they list. And sequent then for to conclude, if they be soules aboue, What whight their fauors to delude, with earthly Cates would proue, Therefore indeuour to inuent, by cunning arte and skil, Some daintie dish incontinent, thy promise to fulfil. For naughtes auayleth to prouide great things of small effect, Stay, stop therfore, pause and abide, this zelous zeale reiect. Demost. Thy iudgement soundeth to the eare, with reason firme in deede, And therefore greedy more to heare, I pray thee to proceede. Sosia. Where foolish iudgement rooteth deepe, and fondnesse beareth fruit: There witlesse will is brought a sleepe, by fansies feeble sute. And then the prouerbes proufe is found. Sus Mineruam. Sus doth Mineruam teach, Therefore with bended knee to grounde, graunt pardon learned leach. For what I woulde, I can not say, and what I can, I may not, Therefore without longer delay, proceede with speede and stay not. Demost. Why licence francke is graunted free, let pardon thee suffice, Set dread a part, and shewe to mee, the sprigges of thy deuise. Sosia. Where ignorance doth lead the route, and guide the ensigne free: There oftentimes it comes aboute, that bloudie fildes we see. And therefore as you pardon graunt, so pardon I request, He is vnwise that seemes to vaunt, on that he knoweth least. For wisedomes loare to take in hande, for Cookes it is vnfit, And wisemen as you vnderstande, will knowe before they knit. Demost. Then tratting neede constraines to way, a salue with posting speede: Harke, Sosia marke this present day, I pray thee to proceede. Unto my place, consisting still, mention for to frame Whereby I may complet my will, and bring about the same. And I shall to the Temple hie, the muses to implore To ayde my wracked fantasie, that then I might adore. Sosia. Thy seruaunts will is readie bente, to graunt to thy desire: Beholde progresses doe relent, and homewarde I retire. Demost. Adew, farewell, farewell, adew, Valeto Sosia mi, Adew, adew, my friende so true thy busenesse doe appli. Sosia. Farewell, in this though I be blinde, yet I may drawe my bowe, In such a sorte to please thy minde, and kill the craftie Crowe. Exit Sosia. Demosthenis quÃ¦rimonia. Demost. Where ebs, and flowes of painfull griefe in siely ship did tosse Of late my ghost, now misbeliefe defines mine endlesse losse. In thraldomes thore (I) rule the rost, in fluctes of blissesse woe, A pillor or a propping post, my pleasure I forgoe. Yet thoughe my fansie naught can vaile, naught trickling teares doe showe, But when that wilfull cares assaile, I catch the ouerthrowe. Therefore since nothing is so dure, but labour can attayne, As Poems doe my breast assure, I minde to take the payne. And this I knowe he is vnmeete, that will not tast the sower, To be a guster of the sweete, in moment of an hower. Scientia. Chastitas &amp; Sapientia. Deare spouse, what senslesse rage doth bind, thy wittes in such a maze? Or else what fogges of mistie minde, do cause thee thus to gaze? Demost. Deare dame, whose vertues manifold, do penetrat the skie, To vewe thy glistering eyes of Golde, no man so glad as I. As Science once, imbrace, imbrace, with stretched armes thy deare, And then he will define the case, of this his heauie cheare. Scientia. Science is bounde to yeeld by right, vnto hir friendly Lorde, And therefore see, with all my might, to this I doe accorde, Disclose therefore, thy secrets all, take time while time may bee, Meridies. For PhÅbus meane doth nigh hand call, prouision for to see. Demost. Prouision that, needes must I wayle, to thinke vpon the same, For all my senses doe me fayle, when dainties you doe name. Where shall I find, a daintie dish? where shall I any buy? For dainties none of fleshe nor fish, in all the worlde I spie. Sapience. Great store, and plenteous plentie is contained euerie where, Reioyce therefore we will not misse, approch dame Wisdome neare. Demost. O blisfull Nimph, O Lamp of trust, O glistering Diamond bright, In whome I hope and euer must, the perfect Lanterne light. I thanke thee thrice and ten times thrice, I grate thee euermore, That wisedome thyne, through thy deuise, hath salude my present sore, Where Science knits a perfect knot, there Sapience taketh place, And chasted lyfe deuoyde of spot, doth gouerne all the race. Chastitie. The sincere path, the rule of lyfe by me prescribed is, The comforte true of man or wyse, the endlesse state of blisse. But briefly shewe what grieuous sore, doth pester in thy minde, That transingly still more and more, no sistaunce thou dost finde: Demost. Consider Iewels preccious deare, my purpose and intent, Is to conniue, attend and heare, the Muses with assent. And Cates delicious to prouide, I thinke it verie fit, But more I seeke, the more as wyde, the marke I can not hit. Sapience. Learne well &amp; marke, print in thy minde, what Iuuenal doth wright, By friendship true which rare I finde, Iuuenal. Rara auis/in terris, nigroque simillima Cygno, as nigred Swaunne to sight. And this, examples doe approue, yet one I wil declare, As principall somewhat to moue, thy clogged breast with care. In friendship fraude is this ye knowe, for Pompei was a friende, And Fraude gaue CÃ¦sar such a blowe, that Friendship had no ende. For ratling speach with great disdaine, did frame suche sore debate, That where as loue was wont to raigne, insued deadly hate. With roaring rage the Cannons rent, and Martiall feates to trie, Betwixt them both they did conuent, in twinckling of an eye. Here Pompei led his valiaunt host, here marched he a mayne, There valiaunt CÃ¦sar seemed to bost, himselfe with all his trayne. Here Pompei gaue the onset free, him CÃ¦sar did withstand, Here Iulius was constraynd to flee, himselfe with all his band. Pompeius followed for a space, and then did backe retire, Reporting that a boy to chase, was last he did desire. When Pompey thought he had the best, and doubted naught at all, Then CÃ¦sar as a sausie gest, for bloudie warre did call. His ensigne boldely to display, he prest with speare and shielde, Bestowing in a comely ray, his armie in the fielde. Of hautie minde, of courage stoute, of stomack stiffe and boulde, By whome his souldiars had no doubt, the conquest for to houlde. When worde came to Pompeius eare, howe euerie case did stande, With liuely hope deuoyd of feare, he toke his charge in hande. As manly as Beterophon, fierce CÃ¦sars might to trie, A knight in stole Armigeron, on him to liue or die. The Trumpets sounded out full shrill, the onset was begunne, No worde was there but slay and kill, from morne till glead of Sunne. Pompeius feete began to faile, his knees to earth did bende, Yet valiauntly he did not quaile, but forwarde bidde to tende. Declaring that the grounde did quake, friendly his manhood to salute, And questing them to take, the wordes he did impute. The souldiars greedie of their pray, set all at sixe and seauen, And fought so cruell that same day, the strokes did sounde to Heauen. The vewers of this dreadfull fight compared it to bee, Coequall to the clipsed sight, that in the ayre we see. But fickle Fortune chaunged at last, by turning of hir wheele, Pompeius state, that nowe agast, compeld he was to reele. To him, whome once he did restore, exiled from his raigne, That nowe with scepter in his Thore, he bare the sway agayne. This prince as soone as he did see Pompeius once his friend, For friendship his did straight decree, of him to make an end. But first in courtious sort and skill, he friendly did him greete, And for to cloake his spitefull will, he met him in the streete, Then feasting him with rost meat free, he beat him with the Spit, And sent him forth most Iudasly, as he supposed fit. To shewe him pleasure to his paine, as it did well appeare, For on the water he was slayne, which murthering did not feare, And straight presented for a gift, to CÃ¦sar, Pompeius head, Thus fickle Fortune driue the drift, that chaunge of choyse did lead. Here friendship fleeted by disdaine, for Pompei proued true, Which for his trustinesse full plaine, bad fading lyfe adue, And whome he counted least his foe, and for his chiefest frinde, By wilfull hap it chaunced soe, did kill him in the ende. Ouidius. En ego, non paucis / quondam munitus amicis: Dum flauit velis aura secunda meis: vt fera nymboso tumueruut Ã¦quora v?to: In medijs lacera puppe relinquor aquis. And Ouid sayth if riches flowe, and honour thou obtayne, Soe long the winde with thee wil blowe, and friends to thee remayne, But when the day is ouercast, with clouds from Fortunes throne, Then will false friends from thee flee fast, and leaue thee all alone. Therrfore a daintie dish it is, a trustie wight to finde, Which in a tempest will not misse, to proue to the full kinde, True, Lodvvicke sleepes in t?be of stone, his carcas wrapt in leadde, And Alexander true is gon, subiect to earthly bedde, Nowe counterfets, which friendly beare, two faces in one hoode, With cloakes dissembling doe appeare, to sucke our friendly bloude. In stead of loue, there hatred growes, where truth shoulde take a place, Their sweltring waues &amp; scourges flow, of spitfull Fortunes face. The strongest Oke is seldome sure, and soonest ouerthrowne, The friend which friendly did indure, at last away is blowne. The brother pareth for to glose, his brother to beguile, And friends are chaunged ofte to foes, within a little whyle. Thus therefore for bycause I know, and likewise plainely see Thy Banquet thinne, I will bestow this daintie dish on thee. That seeke abroad and seldome finde, a trustie friend in deede, To whom thou mayest declare thy minde, when time requireth neede. Demost. Of dainties all I must consent, this daintie for to bee, For friendships Bow is seldome bent, the proufe we daylie see. I thanke thee Sapience from the heart, if it lie in my lotte, Thy gentlenesse which heales my smart, shall neuer be forgot. Sapientia, And I doe muse what diligence, as children doe bestowe, Their parents for to recompence, with honor that they owe. For dutie due, is fledde away, and humblenesse is gon, And true obedience at this day, is colder than the stone. Unbrideled youth, hath no delite, dame Uertue to imbrace, But still indeuour with their might, hir braunches to deface. Goe vewe abroad in euerie coast. and seeme a childe to traine In Godly lyfe, and all is lost, within a yeare or twaine. As Ploughmen rude they doe prepare, king Neroes seede to sowe, Whose deuilish fansie had the care, his mothers wombe to know. And trayned hir euen as the sheepe, are trayned to their bayne, Who falling in a slombring sleepe, with bloudie knyfe was slayne. For Nero slit hir secret wombe, to see if he coulde spie, The tender cell, or chairie Tombe, where he was wont to lye. Such small regarde had he vnto, his tender mothers breast, That beastly nature made him doe, the thing she doubted least. Euen lyke I say at present stint, the worlde is neuer other, So that the childrens breast as flint is stonie to the mother. For when the parents taking paine, at last doe waxe full olde, The children wish to haue them slayne, that they might haue their Golde. Now plaine deceit, hath chose a seate, now falshoode rules the lande, Nowe loue is colde, now children threat, their parents to withstande, How manie buddes of humaine seede, howe manie sonnes remaine, That will about their fayres proceede, to cause their fathers gayne? Nay euery man is fully bent, his propper Chestes to fill, So that they care not with assent, if that their father spill Where spring the braunches of the tree, where Isaac was the roote? Where shall yon finde a simile to set by him his foote. If any aunswere in this case, then nusquam he must say, For well I knowe that PhÅbus face, doth foster none to day. For plyant was he at a becke, and readie at a call, To take a Faggot one his necke, to sacrifice withall. And when as Abraham did declare, howe Isaac needes must die, Most willingly he did prepare, and woulde him not denie. But paciently he toke the crosse, and kneeled on his knee, Beleuing that this mortall losse, was but a fonde decree. What children nowe woulde pleased bee, if this you should request? Or who would yeelde so quietly, to graunt to your behest? They be not borne, nor lyue by breade, throughout the worlde I see, That couet rather to be dead, than leaue this worldly glee. Then farther to the whole effect, and search the pithie style, And tell mee if you doe respect, what newes within a whyle. He was obedient, in so much his parents did him showe, The doctrine pure, of Scriptures such, whereby the Lorde we knowe, They framde his steps to vertues trace, they learnde him how to knit, The perfect webbe, of heauenly grace, they rulde him with a bit. They made him to suppresse desire, his tongue they sought to tame, Bicause of little sparkes of fyre, proceedeth forth a flame. They kept with rod of wisedoms schoole, his childhoode in such awe, That carnall blindnesse waxed coole, so well he knewe the lawe. They did discharge their dueties right, they let him not to stray, But causde him with an humble spright, to wander day by day. His othes were nay, his swearing yee, adherent to the worde, His dealing was from craft full free, as scriptures doe accorde. Demost. Why? then by this you seeme to proue, faultlesse the childe to bee. Science. Not so but fansie did mee moue, both faultes to let thee see. For if the Colt might seeme to raunge, and neuer to be broken, The Bit and Brydle would be straunge, this is a certaine token. And therefore since that euerie man, is faultie, thinke no lesse, But that the childe, doe what he can, is but a sinfull gesse. Yet if the wounde were nere so sore, Omni morbo paratur medicina, a salue is to be founde, Which though it fester more and more at last will make it sounde. But where as suffrance seemes to raigne, all for a little ease, Their straight insueth grieuous paine, the former griefe to pease. As proufe by this we haue in hande, thy fansie to suffise, Where parentes will not vnderstande, their childrens wicked guise. But if they once begin to growe, in rypenesse of their sinne, Though they their wicked ha?t do know, they maintaine them therein. That rype, soone rotten when they bee, then fadeth duetie due, So that their folly as ye see, doth cause themselues to rue. And therefore, should they put in vre, the wisemans saying mylde, So long as breath doth lyfe procure, let chastment rule the childe, For duetie slips, a good cause why, the parentes make and marre, Soe that this vertue certainely must needes be absent farre. Thus what by Tutours fondnesse blinde, and nature of the sprigge, The humble braunches starke I finde vnplyant is the twigge. Therefore this daintie for a dish, of right thou mayst prepare, For which a man maye often wish, but is reperted rare, As much to saye, obedience flame, and inward heat is colde, So that an humble chylde by name, no man can once beholde. For fansie leades their thoughtes astray, and wilfull will is bent, The righteous children for to play, with prodigall assent. That is as long as any note, of vertue doth remayne, They lashe and lauish all a flote till it be gon agayne. The path that Ioseph walked in, is not for them to walke, For why, their vertues verie thinne, are faded to the stalke. Abromnicio pleades their case, with sanguine sworde in hand, A Iustice diet in common place, all goodnesse to withstand. Thus pilgrime like, their race they runne, to no good point at all, But as the War against the Sunne, doth melt away, they fall. That seldome sure or not at all, an humble childe to finde, A man may trauaile where he shall, let this content thy minde, And serue this for a second messe, which I to thee assigne, Bicause thou dost pretend as gesse, to feast the Muses nine. Demost. What ioyes vnto my breast aspire? what gladnesse nowe doth raigne? Hir speach hath set my heart one fyre, hir talke hath ridde my payne. A daintie dishe it is in deede, a seruice harde to see, Where as the childe doth render meede, with lowly bended knee, Unto his auncient fathers head, where siluer haires doe growe, For children nowe are better fedde, than taught, fulwell I knowe. Doth not experience flat define the Nurse constraynd to bowe? Unto hir Cradell oftentime, which right doth not alowe. Yes, right is wrong, and wrong is right, vnkindnesse cloake is kind, The light is darke and darkenesse light, the eyes that see be blind. Thus dainties twayne I haue, but yet the thirde is to be sought, Which, if that I coulde seeme to get, full soone it shoulde be bought. Chastitie. Neyther can Golde attaine the same, but serious payne and toyle, Nor princely money beare the name, without a feruent broyle. For coyne herein doth naught preuaile, I meane in wisedomes lore, The scaling of the walles t'assaile, where Science keepes the dore. And therefore since as Authors olde, when they prepare to write, Their learned Tables doe vnfolde, whereby they should indite. Not otherwise by course I will if thou with heed attend, Indeuour with a simple skill, the thirde dish for to ende. I mase and muse, in what degree, as trustie wyfes doe stande, For well I spie, and plainely see, few faithfull in the lande. They loue a whyle, the prouerbe olde to them may be replyed, Theyr loue so whot is quickly colde, it can not be denyed. Where resteth faithfull Sara now, where is Rebecca pure, Whose bended knees full ofte did bowe, hir husbands griefe to cure? Where is Ioachims faithfull wyfe, Susanna calde by name, Of whome dame vertues braunches ryfe, did worke a worthy fame. First Saraes purpose and intent, to God was to accorde: And secondly with one assent, to please hir faithfull Lorde. Rebecca, sought by charie charge, hir husbandes quiet ease, And wrought all meanes for to inlarge, a salue his yre to pease. Susannaes care was firmely cast, hir chasted vowe to keepe, Despising euerie carnall blast, that luld the soule a sleepe. For when the elders did conspire, their pleasure blynde to haue, By filthy lust of fleshly fire. which made them so to raue. That proching nie, hir bathing place, unto hir they did runne, With flattering style, and craftie face, their purpose to haue done. The beames of grace did so inspire, hir worthy chasted minde, That crackling sparkes of fonde desire, hir soule coulde neuer blinde. She rather chused for to dye, to please their sinfull lust, Than to consent most toruedly, to breake hir promise iust, Loe here the fruite of faithfull state, loe, here both trust and hope, Loe, here dame vertue with hir mate, doth seeme to tende hir scope. Doth present time the lyke declare, are women now so true, Unto their faith to haue a care, and eke their dutie due? Nay faith is fledde, nay faith is dead, nay faith is layed full lowe, For euery wight, with vrgent spight, giues fayth the ouerthrowe. Nowe Venus doth hir banquets make, and lust with painted booke. Proceeds herein the paynes to take, hir darlings names to looke, Then first approcheth to his hande, the marryed femall knot, And nigh to hir there seemes to stande, the Maidens crazed pot. So that as guider of this ray, the harlot Pride is chiefe, And Venus as a rector stay, doth ayde them with reliefe. Then Cupid with his bended Bowe, dischargeth forth his dart, Upon those vessels weake and lowe, that taketh Venus part. Thus wyfes doe raunge in wofull sort, thus snarring they doe iarre, In leauing of their Thalame sport, to hunt the Fox a farre. I will not say that all their might doth giue their bodyes free, In leauing of the perfect light, of Venus court to bee. For I their Odours so doe smell, that needes I must suppose, Their filthy shape, with hir to dwell, that vertue doth repose. Of wedlocke many breake the band, that lincked is so fast, Shall we, say they, as trustie stand to one whyle lyfe doth last. Not so, and why bicause that shame, is chasced from their minde, That shamelesse lyke their chasted name, they dimme, and mussell blinde. Or at the least if Venus net, their fansie can not moue, They doe indeuour for to get, a salue for their behoue. That is the Pehens proude to play, the victorie to obtaine, By which they hope an other day, their husbands to disdaine. With chafing broyle, and chyding checks, they doe indeuour still, To clogge and yoke their marits neckes, that they might haue their will. For one word twaine, for two words three, they practise and intend, And all is for the masterie to purchase in the ende. Thus as the olde Cocke oft doth crowe, the Cockrill learnes apase, With notes full shrill his voice to showe, in euerie meeting place. For damsels deck their hearts with pride, and vaunt themselues so hie, That all their care one euerie side, is vertue to denie. They make a gibe, and iesting stocke, at such as doe despise Their wicked factes, they grine and mock, at euerie good deuise. For if their chasted lyfe beare sway, till twentie yeares be past, Or one and twentie and a day, that number is the last For banquets then of Venus kinde, they couet to attaine, Then Uirgins Lamp is strocken blinde, and chastitie is slayne. Thus wyfes be masters as ye see, and masters made the foote, So as before for victorie, to striue it is no boote. Here as the rest hath giuen to thee, a daintie dish, so I To please thy fainting fantasie, the thirde will not denie. That seeke to finde a trustie wyfe, and trauaile thyne is lost, For many fragile be full ryfe, but faithfull fewe can bost. Demost. A trustie friend an humble childe, a faithfull wyfe say yee? I doe adiure by Marie milde, these verie daintie bee. Now when it please, therefore to heare, the Iunckets I suppose, Most fittest for this royall cheere, the same I will disclose. First gaze I muche where Iustice true, doth plead the poore mans case. And right is rendred, where as due shoulde seeme to haue a place. For money makes them treade a wrie, and turnes the Cat in panne, That shoulde pronounce the equitie, to euerie kinde of man. Then secondly much more I muse, where crafts men lyue vpright, Their ballaunce equally to vse, to euerie simple wight, And last of all where shall we spy, the seruants to fulfill, The seedes of seruice faithfully, to please their masters will. I doubt them all, yet may they be, when as the sea doth flame, Or else I thinke assuredly, fewe such doe beare a name. Thus nowe I iudge my selfe well sped, therefore I heartly pray, That you would take the paynes to lead dame Science home to day. And I the Muses euerie one, will bidde vnto this feast, But bound to you all three alone, I couet for my geast. Sapience. I Wisedome, Science by the palme, will guide vnto the place, And sacred chasted lyfe to calme, shall not absent hir face. Make hast therefore and stay not long, with speede returne agayne, Request of Pallas vs among to dyne to take the payne. Exeunt. Demost. Doubt not, what as your zelous will requesteth for to haue, To complish, yle indeuour still, and Tritons friendship craue. O withering grasse, O fragile shade, O slipperie Tower high, Whose honor as the Hay doth fade, in twinckling of an eye. Where naughts but vanitie doth dwell, and beames of vertue flie, A lurcking denne, a hollow cell, complet with miserie. Repent, with sobbing sighes lament, your frowarde deuilish Art, Least sodenly that you be shent, of limboe taking part, From which repentaunce may you bring a holesome salue and guide, To rest with that eternall King, whose glorie doth not glide. Well, tyme doth wish me to prepare, To seeke to Muses nine, To gust and tast of dainties rare, which you haue heard vs signe. And in meane season I commend you to the shepheard true In whome saluation without ende, doth rest, and thus adue FINIS.</field>
