      <field name="fulltext">AN EVENING AT HOME. To-day a chief was buried—let him rest. His country's bards are up like larks, and fill With singing the wide heavens of his fame. To-night I sit within my lonely room, The atmosphere is full of misty rain, Wretched the earth and heaven. Yesterday The streets and squares were choked with yellow fogs, To-morrow we may all be drenched in sleet! Stretched like a homeless beggar on the ground, The city sleeps amid the misty rain. Though Rain hath pitched his tent above my head, 'Tis but a speck upon the happy world. Since I've begun to trace these lines, Sunrise Has struck a land and woke its bleating hills: Afar upon some black and silent moor The crystal stars are shaking in the wind; An ocean gurgles, for the stooping moon Hath kissed him into peace, and now she smooths The well-pleased monster with her silver hand. Come, naked, gleaming Spring! great crowds of larks Fluttering above thy head, thy happy ears Loud with their ringing songs, Bright Saviour, come! And kill old Winter with thy glorious look, And turn his corse to flowers! I sit to-night As dreary as the pale, deserted East, That sees the Sun, the Sun that once was hers, Forgetful of her, flattering his new love, The happy-blushing West. In these long streets Of traffic and of noise, the human hearts Are hard and loveless as a wreck-strewn coast. Eternity doth wear upon her face The veil of Time. They only see the veil, And thus they know not what they stand so near. Oh, rich in gold! Beggars in heart and soul! Poor as the empty void! Why, even I, Sitting in this bare chamber with my thoughts, Am richer than ye all, despite your bales, Your streets of warehouses, your mighty mills, Each booming like a world faint heard in space: Your ships; unwilling fires, that day and night Writhe in your service seven years, then die Without one taste of peace. Do ye believe A simple primrose on a grassy bank Forth-peeping to the sun, a wild bird's nest, The great orb dying in a ring of clouds, Like hoary Jacob 'mong his waiting sons; The rising moon, and the young stars of God, Are things to love? With these my soul is brimmed; With a diviner and serener joy Than all thy heaven of money-bags can bring Thy dry heart, Worldling! The terror-stricken rain Flings itself wildly on the window-panes, Imploring shelter from the chasing wind. Alas! to-night in this wide waste of streets It beats on human limbs as well as walls! God led Eve forth into the empty world From Paradise. Could our great Mother come And see her children now, what sight were worst; A worker woke by cruel Day, the while A kind dream feeds with sweetest phantom-bread, Him, and his famished ones; or when the wind, With shuddering fingers, draws the veil of smoke, And scares her with a battle's bleeding face? Most brilliant star upon the crest of Time Is England. England! Oh, I know a tale Of those far summers when she lay in the sun, Listening to her own larks, with growing limbs, And mighty hands, which since have tamed the world, Dreaming about their tasks. This dreary night I'll tell the story to my listening heart. I sang 't to thee, O unforgotten Friend! (Who dwellest now on breezy English downs, While I am drowning in the hateful smoke) Beside the river which I long have loved. O happy Days! O happy, happy Past! O Friend! I am a lone benighted ship; Before me hangs the vast untravelled gloom, Behind, a wake of splendour, fading fast Into the hungry gloom from whence it came. Two days the Lady gazed toward the west, The way that he had gone; and when the third From its high noon sloped to a rosy close, Upon the western margin of the isle, Feeding her petted swans by tossing bread Among the clumps of water-lilies white, She stood. The fond Day pressed against her face; His am'rous, airy fingers, with her robe Fluttered and played, and trembling, touched her throat, And toying with her ringlets, could have died Upon her sweet lips and her happy cheeks! With a long rippling sigh she turned away, And wished the sun was underneath the hills. Anon she sang; and ignorant Solitude, Astonished at the marvel of her voice, Stood tranced and mute as savage at the door Of rich cathedral when the organ rolls, And all the answering choirs awake at once. Then she sat down and thought upon her love; Fed on the various wonders of his face To make his absence rich. “'Tis but three days Since he went from me in his light canoe, And all the world went with him, and to-night He will be back again. Oh, when he comes, And when my head is laid upon his breast, And in the pauses of the sweetest storm Of kisses that e'er beat upon a face, I'll tell him how I've pined, and sighed, and wept, And thought of those sweet days and nights that flew O'er us unheeded as a string of swans, That wavers down the sky toward the sea,— And he will chide me into blissful tears, Then kiss the tears away.” Quick leapt she up, “He comes! he comes!” She laughed, and clapt her hands, A light canoe came dancing o'er the lake, And he within it gave a cry of joy. She sent an answer back that drew him on. The swans are scared,—the lilies rippled—now Her happy face is hidden in his breast, And words are lost in joy. “My Bertha! let Me see myself again in those dear orbs. Have you been lonely, love?” She raised her head, “You surely will not leave me so again! I'll grow as pale's the moon, and my praised cheeks Will be as wet as April's if you do.” As when the moon hath sleeked the blissful sea, A light wind wrinkles it and passes off, So ran a transient trouble o'er his face. “My Bertha! we must leave this isle to-night. Thy shining face is blanked! We will return Ere thrice the day, like a great bird of light Flees 'cross the dark, and hides it with his wings.” “Ah, wherefore?” “Listen, I will tell you why. “I stood afar upon the grassy hills, I saw the country with its golden slopes, And woods, and streams, run down to meet the sea. I saw the basking ocean skinned with light. I saw the surf upon the distant sands Silent and white as snow. Above my head A lark was singing, 'neath a sunny cloud, Around the playing winds. As I went down There seemed a special wonder on the shore, Low murmuring crowds around a temple stood: There was a wildered music on the air, Which came and went, yet ever nearer grew, When, lo! a train came upward from the sea With snowy garments, and with reverend steps, Full in their front a silver cross they bore, And this sweet hymn they strewed along the winds. ‘Blest be this sunny morning, sweet and fair! Blest be the people of this pleasant land! Ye unseen larks that sing a mile in air, Ye waving forests, waving green and grand, Ye waves, that dance upon the flashing strand, Ye children golden-haired! we bring, we bring A gospel hallowing.’ Then one stood forth and spoke against the gods; He called them ‘cruel gods,’ and then he said, ‘We have a Father, One who dwells serene, 'Bove thunder and the stars, Whose eye is mild, And ever open as the summer sky; Who cares for everything on earth alike, Who hears the plovers crying in the wind, The happy linnets singing in the broom, Whose smile is sunshine.’ When the old man ceased, Forth from the murmuring crowd there stepped a youth, As bright-haired as a star, and cried aloud, ‘Friends! I've grown up among the wilds, and found Each outward form is but a window whence Terror or Beauty looks. Beauty I've seen In the sweet eyes of flowers, along the streams, And in the cold and crystal wells that sleep Far in the murmur of the summer woods; Terror in fire and thunder, in the worn And haggard faces of the winter clouds, In shuddering winds, and oft on moonless nights I've heard it in the white and wailing fringe That runs along the coast from end to end. The mountains brooded on some wondrous thought Which they would ne'er reveal. I seemed to stand Outside of all things; my desire to know Grew wild and eager as a starving wolf. To gain the secret of the awful world, I knelt before the gods, and then held up My heart to them in the pure arms of prayer— They gave no answer, or had none to give. Friends! I will test these sour and sullen gods: If they are weak, 'tis well, we then may list Unto the strangers; but if my affront Draw angry fire, I shall be slain by gods, And Death may have no secrets. A spear! a steed!’ A steed was brought by trembling hands, he sprang And dashed towards the temple with a cry. A shudder ran through all the pallid crowds. I saw him enter, and my sight grew dim, And on a long-suspended breath I stood, Till one might count a hundred beats of heart: Then he rode slowly forth, and, wondrous strange! Although an awful gleam lay on his face, His charger's limbs were drenched with terror-sweat. Amid the anxious silence loud he cried, ‘Gods, marvellously meek! Why, any child May pluck them by the beard, spit in their face, Or smite them on the mouth; they can do nought, But sit like poor old foolish men, and moan. I flung my spear.’—Here, as a singing rill Is in the mighty noise of ocean drowned, His voice was swallowed in the shout that rose, And touched the heavens, ran along the hills, Thence came an after silence, strange and dim. A voice rose 'mong the strangers like a lark, And warbled out its joy, then died away. And the old man that spoke before went on, And, oh! the gentle music of his voice Stirred through my heart-strings like a wind through reeds. He said, ‘It was God's hand that shaped the world And laid it in the sunbeams:’ and that ‘God, With His great presence fills the universe. That, could we dwell like night among the stars, Or plunge with whales in the unsounded sea, He still would be around us with His care.’ And also, ‘That, as flowers come back in Spring, We would live after Death.’ I heard no more. I thought of thee in this delightful isle, Pure as a prayer, and wished that I had wings To tell you swiftly, that the death we feared Was but a grey eve 'tween two shining days, That we would love for ever! Then I thought Our home might be in that transparent star Which we have often watched from off this verge, Stand in the dying sunset, large and clear— The humming world awoke me from my dream. I saw the old gods tumbled on the grass Like uncouth stones, they threw the temple wide, And Summer, with her bright and happy face, Looked in upon its gloom, and pensive grew. The while among the tumult of the crowds, Divinest hymns the white-robed stranger sang. I wearied for thee, Bertha! and I came. Wilt go and hear these strangers?” She turned on him A look of love—a look that richly crowned A moment heavenly rich, and murmured “Yes.” He kissed her proudly, while a giddy tear, Wild with its happiness, ran down her cheek And perished in the dew. They took their seats. And as the paddles struck, grey-pinioned Time Flew through the gates of sunset into Night, And held through stars to gain the coasts of Morn. 'Tis done! The phantoms of my soul have fled Into the night, and I am left alone With that sweet sadness which doth ever dwell On the brink of tears; I stare i' th' crumbling fire Which from my brooding eye takes strangest shapes. The Past is with me, and I scarcely hear Outside the weeping of the homeless rain. LADY BARBARA. Earl Gawain wooed the Lady Barbara,— High-thoughted Barbara, so white and cold! 'Mong broad-branched beeches in the summer shaw, In soft green light his passion he has told. When rain-beat winds did shriek across the wold, The Earl to take her fair reluctant ear Framed passion-trembled ditties manifold; Silent she sat his am'rous breath to hear, With calm and steady eyes, her heart was otherwhere. He sighed for her through all the summer weeks; Sitting beneath a tree whose fruitful boughs Bore glorious apples with smooth-shining cheeks, Earl Gawain came and whispered, “Lady, rouse! Thou art no vestal held in holy vows; Out with our falcons to the pleasant heath.” Her father's blood leapt up unto her brows— He who, exulting on the trumpet's breath, Came charging like a star across the lists of death, Trembled, and passed before her high rebuke: And then she sat, her hands clasped round her knee: Like one far-thoughted was the lady's look, For in a morning cold as misery She saw a lone ship sailing on the sea; Before the north 'twas driven like a cloud, High on the poop a man sat mournfully: The wind was whistling thorough mast and shroud. And to the whistling wind thus did he sing aloud:— “Didst look last night upon my native vales, Thou Sun! that from the drenching sea hast clomb? Ye demon winds! that glut my gaping sails, Upon the salt sea must I ever roam, Wander for ever on the barren foam? O happy are ye, resting mariners. O Death, that thou wouldst come and take me home! A hand unseen this vessel onward steers, And onward I must float through slow moon-measured years. “Ye winds! when like a curse ye drove us on, Frothing the waters, and along our way, Nor cape nor headland through red mornings shone, One wept aloud, one shuddered down to pray, One howled, ‘Upon the Deep we are astray.’ On our wild hearts his words fell like a blight: In one short hour my hair was stricken grey, For all the crew sank ghastly in my sight As we went driving on through the cold starry night. “Madness fell on me in my loneliness, The sea foamed curses, and the reeling sky Became a dreadful face which did oppress Me with the weight of its unwinking eye. It fled, when I burst forth into a cry— A shoal of fiends came on me from the deep; I hid, but in all corners they did pry, And dragged me forth, and round did dance and leap; They mouthed on me in dream, and tore me from sweet sleep. “Strange constellations burned above my head, Strange birds around the vessel shrieked and flew, Strange shapes, like shadows, through the clear sea fled, As our lone ship, wide-winged, came rippling through, Angering to foam the smooth and sleeping blue.” The lady sighed, “Far, far upon the sea, My own Sir Arthur, could I die with you! The wind blows shrill between my love and me.” Fond heart! the space between was but the apple-tree. There was a cry of joy, with seeking hands She fled to him, like worn bird to her nest; Like washing water on the figured sands, His being came and went in sweet unrest, As from the mighty shelter of his breast The Lady Barbara her head uprears With a wan smile, “Methinks I'm but half blest: Now when I've found thee, after weary years, I cannot see thee, love! so blind I am with tears.” TO ? The broken moon lay in the autumn sky, And I lay at thy feet; You bent above me; in the silence I Could hear my wild heart beat. I spoke; my soul was full of trembling fears At what my words would bring: You raised your face, your eyes were full of tears, As the sweet eyes of Spring. You kissed me then, I worshipped at thy feet Upon the shadowy sod. Oh, fool, I loved thee! loved thee, lovely cheat! Better than Fame or God. My soul leaped up beneath thy timid kiss; What then to me were groans, Or pain, or death? Earth was a round of bliss, I seemed to walk on thrones. And you were with me 'mong the rushing wheels, 'Mid Trade's tumultuous jars; And where to awe-struck wilds the Night reveals Her hollow gulfs of stars. Before your window, as before a shrine, I've knelt 'mong dew-soaked flowers, While distant music-bells, with voices fine, Measured the midnight hours. There came a fearful moment: I was pale, You wept, and never spoke, But clung around me as the woodbine frail Clings, pleading, round an oak. Upon my wrong I steadied up my soul, And flung thee from myself; I spurned thy love as 't were a rich man's dole,— It was my only wealth. I spurned thee! I, who loved thee, could have died, That hoped to call thee “wife,” And bear thee, gently-smiling at my side, Through all the shocks of life! Too late, thy fatal beauty and thy tears, Thy vows, thy passionate breath; I'll meet thee not in Life, nor in the spheres Made visible by Death. SONNETS. [I cannot deem why men toil so for Fame.] I cannot deem why men toil so for Fame. A porter is a porter though his load Be the oceaned world, and although his road Be down the ages. What is in a name? Ah! 't is our spirit's curse to strive and seek. Although its heart is rich in pearls and ores, The Sea complains upon a thousand shores; Sea-like we moan for ever. We are weak. We ever hunger for diviner stores. I cannot say I have a thirsting deep For human fame, nor is my spirit bowed To be a mummy above ground to keep For stare and handling of the vulgar crowd, Defrauded of my natural rest and sleep. [There have been vast displays of critic wit] There have been vast displays of critic wit O'er those who vainly flutter feeble wings, Nor rise an inch 'bove ground,—weak Poetlings! And on them to the death men's brows are knit. Ye men! ye critics! seems 't so very fit They on a storm of laughter should be blown O'er the world's edge to Limbo? Be it known, Ye men! ye critics! that beneath the sun The chiefest woe is this,—When all alone, And strong as life, a soul's great currents run Poesy-ward, like rivers in the sea, But never reach 't. Critic, let that soul moan In its own hell without a kick from thee. Kind Death, kiss gently, ease this weary one! [Joy like a stream flows through the Christmas-streets] Joy like a stream flows through the Christmas-streets, But I am sitting in my silent room, Sitting all silent in congenial gloom. To-night, while half the world the other greets With smiles and grasping hands and drinks and meats, I sit and muse on my poetic doom; Like the dim scent within a budded rose, A joy is folded in my heart; and when I think on Poets nurtured 'mong the throes, And by the lowly hearths of common men,— Think of their works, some song, some swelling ode With gorgeous music growing to a close, Deep-muffled as the dead-march of a god,— My heart is burning to be one of those. [Beauty still walketh on the earth and air] Beauty still walketh on the earth and air, Our present sunsets are as rich in gold As ere the Iliad's music was out-rolled; The roses of the Spring are ever fair, 'Mong branches green still ring-doves coo and pair, And the deep sea still foams its music old. So, if we are at all divinely souled, This beauty will unloose our bonds of care. 'T is pleasant, when blue skies are o'er us bending Within old starry-gated Poesy, To meet a soul set to no worldly tune, Like thine, sweet Friend! Oh, dearer this to me Than are the dewy trees, the sun, the moon, Or noble music with a golden ending. [Last night my cheek was wetted with warm tears] Last night my cheek was wetted with warm tears, Each worth a world. They fell from eyes divine. Last night a loving lip was pressed to mine, And at its touch fled all the barren years; And softly couched upon a bosom white, Which came and went beneath me like a sea, An emperor I lay in empire bright, Lord of the beating heart, while tenderly Love-words were glutting my love-greedy ears. Kind Love, I thank thee for that happy night! Richer this cheek with those warm tears of thine Than the vast midnight with its gleaming spheres. Leander toiling through the moonlight brine, Kingdomless Anthony, were scarce my peers. [I wrote a Name upon the river sands] I wrote a Name upon the river sands With her who bore it standing by my side, Her large dark eyes lit up with gentle pride, And leaning on my arm with claspèd hands, To burning words of mine she thus replied, “Nay, writ not on thy heart. This tablet frail Fitteth as frail a vow. Fantastic bands Will scarce confine these limbs.” I turned love-pale, I gazed upon the rivered landscape wide, And thought how little it would all avail Without her love. 'T was on a morn of May, Within a month I stood upon the sand, Gone was the name I traced with trembling hand,— And from my heart 't was also gone away. [Like clouds or streams we wandered on at will] Like clouds or streams we wandered on at will, Three glorious days, till, near our journey's end, As down the moorland road we straight did wend, To Wordsworth's “Inversneyd,” talking to kill The cold and cheerless drizzle in the air, 'Bove me I saw, at pointing of my friend, An old fort like a ghost upon the hill, Stare in blank misery through the blinding rain, So human-like it seemed in its despair— So stunned with grief—long gazed at it we twain. Weary and damp we reached our poor abode, I, warmly seated in the chimney-nook, Still saw that old Fort o'er the moorland road Stare through the rain with strange woe-wildered look. [Sheathed is the river as it glideth by] Sheathed is the river as it glideth by, Frost-pearled are all the boughs in forests old, The sheep are huddling close upon the wold, And over them the stars tremble on high. Pure joys these winter nights around me lie; 'T is fine to loiter through the lighted street At Christmas time, and guess from brow and pace The doom and history of each one we meet, What kind of heart beats in each dusky case; Whiles startled by the beauty of a face In a shop-light a moment. Or instead, To dream of silent fields where calm and deep The sunshine lieth like a golden sleep— Recalling sweetest looks of Summers dead.</field>
