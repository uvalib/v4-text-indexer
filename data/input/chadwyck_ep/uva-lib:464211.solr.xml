Oh! shee's gone to purge, for late shee tooke a glister: Faithe Doctor you did Ill, you might haue done but kist-her.

Courtiers are bad: Towns-men are often naught, And Contrey-men (quoth he) are most vntaught. Therefore on these shee's plainly cast awaye: Oh! my deare Luste (quoth he,) what shall I saie? Why faith (quoth he,) 'fore shalt be quite vndone, I'le see thee made my selfe an honest Nunn Soe putting hir 'mongst holly Nunnes to dwell, His body dies, and's soule departs to hell. Satire. 38.

For on each side on's cloake, each hand he laies, By which fine sleight he beares it back alwaies. So by that meanes (maugre his mantles spight) His sattin sleeues and Ierkin shall haue light.

Since both their states by subjects be vp-held, That both are Kinges it cannot be repell'd. They both bee Kinges: But th' Poetts Realme I finde, Restes in the Climar of a fittle minde.

Earth disgorge thy selfe of Allexander, I long to fight (quoth he) with that Commaunder. Good Grandam let them but appeare in sight, That they may once but taste of this armes might. And then againe too's flashing worke he goes, Wishing that all those postes were deadly foes. Would here were Roman Ceasar Romes great King, I faith (quoth he) I'de make his Cox-combe sing, And then he foines &amp; strikes, (without all staie) Stooles, Chaires, Formes, bordes, or what else is in's waie. Still executing's wrath vppon those men, Till's angrie wife came in, and rescu'd them For in shee came, and in her hand a Ladle, With which shee swing'd him well about the nodle. And why? alas he rockt not well the cradle. Satire 62. [Metamorphiz'd Mick: where's thy Target man?] Metamorphiz'd Mick: where's thy Target man? What chaung'd into a lisping Ladies fann?

So leauing them, tripping vppon hir toes, Into hir shopp, t'ir prentizes shee goes, Where if shee sees a boye but looke a wrie, Why sauce-box, what stare you on shee'le crie?

Satire 15 [Some thinkes that Vardingales that's monstrous wide] Some thinkes that Vardingales that's monstrous wide, At firste invented were onely for pride, But truely none that thinketh soe as this, But gesse (beleeue me) too too much a misse, For they (I certainely it's soe surmi'sd,) For these three reasons were at firste deui'sd. Firste, for hott girles that subiect are to sweate, It letts vp aire whereby to coole there heat. Then for the girle whose bumm standeth not right, (Tough hopper-tail'd) yet that will hide it quite. But cheifly dus the wench, who through an Itch, Has gott: alas I scratch a ?

Tayler quoth shee, I'me sure that I shall finde Bodies made like thine fitting'st to my minde, Noe other measure for my bodie take, But by thy bodie, my newe bodies make. Alas quoth hee those bodies ne're will fitt. Ah Asse quoth shee, that Noddies had but witt Then might my bodie, bodies haue right good, And easlye I might haue been vnderstood. 'Waie hence (quoth shee) thou art some botching Noddy, That canst not measure right a womans bodie. Satire 17.

And there shee stopps, setting hir teeth soe close, As if shee fear'd hir madd-tongue would breake loose. The fourth more wise: saies weake-ones must toth' wall, Wee're borne to beare quoth shee: letts put vp all. And then the bowle, the gossipps bowle ginnes walke, But that once off: againe their tongues must talke. Satire 18.

Ah Laba hadst ath' sheepe but learned this, Thy tall man had not had thee then I wis. Faith wench, hadst but a lowe man halfe an houre, Thou'dst tell mee all that's tall, are rancke &amp; soure, Satire 20. [I must distill my witts best quintessence] I must distill my witts best quintessence, To Carractrise the wisdome of wise Prudence, Hir worthy actes are of such noble fame, As I'le haue Hall to Cronicle the same. You long to heare hir deedes? I knowe you doe: Will you be silent then? well then goe toe. Shee 'fore hir Father, Mother, folkes and all, Settes vp hir legg ath'mantle-tree ith'wall, Quoth shee now Father I'le doe wonders great, The old folkes hearing that (with feare) gann sweat, Shee seeing that, shee bidds them nothing doubt. For I (quoth shee) will onely pufft this fire out. And therewithall shee lett forth such a ?

[For certen, yet in woemen ther's some sweet] For certen, yet in woemen ther's some sweet, With which wee blinde-men yet could neuer meet, By reason naturall it must be soe, To proue the same let's to the Bee-hiue goe, Why did dame Nature giue the Bee a sting? Some reasons sh'ad to giue hir such a thing. And place it in hir taile (men marke the case) The prettie Bees sweetst best &amp; ritchest place, Hir reason why shee plac't it in hir taile, Was this (if my opinion doe not faile) Because that place hir treas'rie is: in which Lies all hir wealth: For Bees be sweetly ritch. Now as with stinges dame Nature made the Bee, Soe woemen hath shee made with stinges wee see, For all their heades (I hope I doe none wrong) Containeth stings: If not a stinge, a tongue, But let vs term't a stinge; for it will prick, And hee that striues with it gainst thornes dus kick: They hauing stinges, noe question if wee search, Shall honny finde where those sharpe stinges doe pearch.

[Mjlda? since you betooke your self to wiue] Mjlda? since you betooke your self to wiue, I hope y'aue tane the skillfulst tricks to thriue. The time was Milda when your slender back, (To couer it) a gowne well-nie did lack. But now, nor gowne, nor nothing else you want, What can you aske? but straight it has a graunt. Manie Maidens, manie things would choake, Had they (as you haue) Milda such a cloake. For doe you heare? it may not be denaied But cloakes fitts wiues, when they'le not doe a maide Yet Milda faith I speake it to your grace, You should haue chose your cloake with better face. Satire 24 [A ladie fairer farr then fortunate] A ladie fairer farr then fortunate, (In dauncing) thus o'reshott hirselfe of late, The musick not in tune, pleas'd not hir minde, For which: shee with the fidlers fault did finde.

Whereat the fidling knaues thus did hir greete Maddam your pipe's in tune, it plaies most sweete, strike vp quoth they, (but then the knaues doe smile) And as you pipe, wee'le daunce an other while.

[Welthus, none of your daughters that I sawe] Welthus, none of your daughters that I sawe, But halfe did tempt mee be your sonne in lawe: And iuste but halfe: For euer I did see, In eech of them, somwhat to alter mee. Kates Virtues my affection much did moue. But streight hir crookednesse did quench that loue. Black Sues great portion made mee wish hir well, But thinking on hir pride my loue straight fell. Besse for his bewtie I could much affect, But Besse wantes witt, that made mee Besse reiect, With Doll for hir housseffrie I could hould, But blame not smale men, much to feare a scould. Ellen for hir silence I could loue: but Although I hate a scould, I loath a slutt. Were Nan noe wanton, shee'd my humor sitt, But Nan has wantonnes vnto hir witt, Yet Wealthus giue me Nan, for doe you heare? With wantonnes (as most men dus) J'le beare. Satire 26. [Sweet Mistresse, I'le not putt thee (thou shalt finde)] Sweet Mistresse, I'le not putt thee (thou shalt finde) In this my bookes disgracefulst place behinde, In that place will I toothles Liva putt, And flout at hir, cause shee's soe rancke a slutt. And Minsa there I'le putt, who eates at table, As if to eate at all, shee were not able. Hir, there I'le put, cause 'fore solkes shee'le not eate, But in a corner eate vp worldes of meate. Likewise I'le Lica put into that place, For Cuckolding hir man before his face. But Mistresse, you behinde I'le neuer put, Worldes of wealth, shall ne're perswade mee too't. Where louers put their loues, there doe you looke To bee inrouled, and put in my booke: Ith' midle, and before, (cann I doe lesse?) There will I put you, my sweet Misteresse. Where J will write on you; thinges of delight, Thinges fittli'st fitting true-loues appetite. Satire 27. [And praie now why is there noe likelyhood] And praie now why is there noe likelyhood That Agus should doe his yong wife noe good? Heare my example, and I'le proue it then, That none please yong Girles like these aged men. A yong-man hauing matter to endite, With manie wordes superfluous hee doth write, Loading the paper with much Idle stuff, O'rechardging it with much more then enough. Whereas an aged man dus neuer write, But vntoth' purpose hee dus still endite. What e're ould men doe doe: (I doe not flatter) Toth'purpose tis: they roundly goe toth' matter. And therefore Tatlus, why art such a one, To thinke that Agus sonne, is not his sonne? Ist cause the boie is such a chopping ladd? Or cause hee is not hair'd like his old dadd? If this bee all? then thou a fault art in, Why Tatlus, hee is like his mothers kinn, His mother couzens hath: fine proper men, The boie in fauour maie bee like to them. Or like his god-fathers the boie may bee, That falls out oft, although noe kinn you see. Fie Tatlus, I faith thou hast a slaund'rouus tongue, To doe an old-mans yong-wife soe much wrong: Why old-mens breath getts boies, it is soe strong. Satire 28. [Lord, what meane you Gossipp? praie forbeare] Lord, what meane you Gossipp? praie forbeare, My husband noates your often comming here, Soe soone as euer hee is gott toth' Plowe, You are here: praie la-bee: what ayle you now? I will not faith: good-lord y'are such a man, I hope you'le rest: hee will bee here a nan: Y'are such an other: whoo'd thinke you such a one? Oh! I heare my husband: praie bee gone. La-bee I saie: fie, fie: I praie la-bee, Hee's in the yard, hee's crying hutt and gee. Harke, harke; J saith J heare him: oh tis sore! Naibour: sneake out, &amp; I will watch at dore. Satire 29 [Why John quoth Nan, I praie nowe John forbeare] Why John quoth Nan, I praie nowe John forbeare: You'le not a done, Ifaith I'le hitt your eare, Whoo'd bee a Chamber-maide? why Iohn? fie, fie: A done I saie; Ifaith Iohn I will crie, Pussh, pussh: praie leaue, another time you shall, Why harke; praie harke: Ifaith my Mistresse call. Shee'd rise and make hir readie: out alas, How will shee tie hir shoes and want hir glasse? I'm in a fine case to goe to hir sir: Fie John: are not you sham'd to keepe this stirr? I'de not ha thought you would haue vs'd mee soe, How is my colour? fie how I doe blowe? Shame you not to putt mee in this heate? A handkercher: fie, how my face dus sweat. Well, well: Ifaith did not I loue you well, Of this your wagg'rie to your shame I'de tell, Lord my ruff! sett it with thy finger Iohn, Harke, harke; pies on hir, how shee rapps for Nan. Fare-well, J'le tell hir, sh'as a waggish man, Satire 30 [I could allowe your suite; but doe you here?] I could allowe your suite; but doe you here? My creditt Sir: my reputation's deare, What greater blott could to my Credit bee? Then yeilde my loue to such a one as yee. Againe you knowe your maister growes of late, To haue a mar'les suspitious Ieolous pate. H'immagins what has past: and John you knowe, Wee haue too open been; twas longe of you. Lett's charie bee: my deeds shall then approue, That like to thee, none shall attaine my loue. Satire 31. [Prouda: your Father on his death-bedd lies] Prouda: your Father on his death-bedd lies, Tis tenn to one, within this howre hee dies. For God-sake Prouda while as hee doth liue, Goe vnto him; &amp; his greate faulte forgiue. Hee dus desire the same: hee praies that hee (E're die) to you may reconciled bee. For God-sake Prouda let his latest breath Make you a mendes: hee'le seale the same with Death. Were I a maide, my Father should be bould To saie, &amp; saie againe that I were old. Alas your father takes it on his death, Hee ment noe harme with vtt'ring of that breath. Hee vowes, hee little thought to woman-kinde, That saying would haue troubled so their minde. Good yong-Prouda, now shewe your selfe t' aue witt, And but vnto his death hate him for it. Satire 32. [Widowes? your Push, nor Praie Sir stand awaie] Widowes? your Push, nor Praie Sir stand awaie, Noe nor your fie for shame, forbeare I praie, Can make a souldier cease his enterprise; I tell you widowes, souldiers are too wise, They know that breaches into Towres are made, To enter them; whereby the Towre t'invade. They knowe that asking, shall J enter in?! Is not the waie a Towre, or Forte to winn. Their discipline is such, they vse smale speech, But with true courage, falls-vppintoh' breach. Where maugre Daungers worste, they'le make th'adventure, And (as true spirits should) brauely enter. They will not with beseechings pray them yeild, For falls they'le take, but they will winn the field. Satire 33. [VVhy Matrita, what will it praie boote mee?] VVhy Matrita, what will it praie boote mee? To blabb, or tell a tatling tale of thee, Should I gaine ought to saie thou louest John? That smooth-chin'd youth thy fathers serving-man, Not for a thousand Millions I'le report, That nightly to his bedd thou dust resort. Why, I could tell what trickes hee putts on thee: But they shall neuer be reueal'd for mee, The gettings will but little fill my purse, To tell of thy two children sent to nurse. Or tell howe closely eu'rie thing was wrought, As how the mid-wife, blind-folded was brought. Ifaith but Idle I my selfe should showe, If I should make the world, these secretts knowe. Come wench: none shall know't: bee not whit dismaiede, Some Londonier will take thee for a maide. Satire 34. [Deepe desp'rat daunger in this Satire lies] Deepe desp'rat daunger in this Satire lies, Cause desp'rat folkes it dus annotomize. It tells what manner chatt, when woemen meete, They each the other commonly doe greete. Kate bidds hir Gossipp sitt, which once downe sett, Then fall they vnto that, for which they mett. That is to prate as they occasion take. As each occasion for their purpose make, Occasion good kinde Kate has full enough. To praise hir gossipps fashonable ruffe. Hir gossipp sitts not mumm, but shee agen, Lookes on Kates gowne, and much comends it then, Or on hir hatt, orelse vpon hir tyre, Commending (for the fasshon) hir high wyre. Protesting if hir husband were noe clowne, Shee would (e're long) haue such a fasshon'd gowne. Hee has enough (quoth shee) and then shee weepes, But mee (Ifaith (the hogg) at hard-meat keepes. At which; hir gossipp Kate comforts hir then, And tells hir there's noe best amongst these men. Tis thought that I quoth shee lead a good life, But Gossipp, gossipp, since I were his wife, God knowes it gossipp (speake to you I maie) I haue endur'd manie a stormie daie, And then dus too-kinde Kate a crying fall, At ende of which, shee curseth man-kinde all. Yet faith quoth shee why should wee freit at man? They'le all be naught, lett vs doe what wee cann. I, quoth hir gossipp, they bee crabby elues, But letts be wise, &amp; make much of ourselues. And then the Custardes fetcht to cheare the harte, At eating which, they'le laugh vntill they ? Satire 35. [My ruf-rude penn would women fayne befrend] My ruf-rude penn would women fayne befrend Could it but finde one worthie to commend It findes but one, my Mistres is that one Else had this barren world afforded none Yet ne're-seene-shee howe shall J sett hir forth?

Howe sowre's my life to what it was of late While I in Cottadge did my selfe containe Poore simple I, knewe nothinge that was vaine Then might I gam som bee with modestie Yet vnsuspected rest, from Ieolosie The Milk-maydes life, oh happ'ire t'is I weene Then is the life to be an Emprours Queene.
