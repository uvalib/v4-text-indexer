Amys and Amylion For goddes loue in trinyte Al Ã¾at ben hend herkeniÃ¾ to me, I pray ?ow, par amoure, What sum-tyme fel be?ond Ã¾e see [Of] two barons of grete bounte And men of grete honoure; Her faders were barons hende, Lordinges com of grete kynde And pris men in toun and tour; To here of Ã¾ese children two How Ã¾ey were in wele and woo Ywys it is grete doloure. In weele and woo how Ã¾ey gan wynd &amp; how vnkouth Ã¾ey were of kynd, Ãe children bold of chere, And how Ã¾ey were good &amp; hend And how ?ong Ã¾ei becom frend In cort Ã¾ere Ã¾ey were, And how Ã¾ey were made kny?t And how Ã¾ey were trouÃ¾ ply?t, Ãe children boÃ¾ in fere, And in what lond Ã¾ei were born And what Ã¾e childres name worn HerkeneÃ¾ and ?e mow here. In Lumbardy, y vnderstond, Whilom bifel in Ã¾at lond, In romance as we reede, Two barouns hend wonyd in lond And had two ladyes free to fond, Ãat worthy were in wede; Of her hend ladyes two Twoo knaue childre gat Ã¾ey Ã¾oo Ãat dou?ty were of dede, And trew weren in al Ã¾ing, And Ã¾erfore Ihesu, heuyn-king, Ful wel quyted her mede. Ãe children-is names, as y ?ow hy?t, In ryme y wol rekene ry?t And tel in my talkyng; BoÃ¾ Ã¾ey were getyn in oo ny?t And on oo day born a-ply?t, For soth with-out lesyng; Ãat oon baroun son, ywys Was ycleped childe Amys At his cristenyng; Ãat oÃ¾ur was clepyd Amylyoun, Ãat was a childe of grete renoun And com of hy?e ofspryng. The children gon Ã¾en Ã¾ryue, Fairer were neuer noon on lyue, Curtaise, hende, and good; When Ã¾ey were of ?eres fyue, Alle her kyn was of hem blyÃ¾, So mylde Ã¾ey were of mood; When Ã¾ey were seuyn ?ere olde, Grete ioy euery man of hem tolde To beholde Ã¾at frely foode; When Ã¾ey were twel ?ere olde, In al Ã¾e londe were noon so bolde, So faire of boon and blood. In Ã¾at tyme, y vnderstond, A duk wonyd in Ã¾at lond, Prys in toun and toure; Frely he let [sende his sonde], After erles, barouns, fre and bond, And ladies bry?t in boure; A ryche fest he wolde make Al for Ihesu Cristes sake Ãat is oure sauyoure; Muche folk, as y ?ow saye, He lete after sende Ã¾at daye With myrth [and] grete honoure. Thoo barouns twoo, Ã¾at y of tolde, And her sones feire and bolde To court Ã¾ey com ful ?are. When Ã¾ey were comyn, ?ong and olde, Mony men gan hem byholde Of lordynges Ã¾at Ã¾ere were, Of body how wel Ã¾ey were py?t, And how feire Ã¾ey were of sy?t, Of hyde and hew and here; And al Ã¾ey seide with-out lesse Fairer children Ã¾an Ã¾ey wesse Ne sey Ã¾ey neuer ?ere. In al Ã¾e court was Ã¾er no wy?t, Erl, baroun, squyer, ne kny?t, Neither lef ne loothe, So lyche Ã¾ey were both of sy?t And of waxing, y ?ow ply?tâ I tel ?ow for sootheâ In al Ã¾ing Ã¾ey were so lyche Ãer was neither pore ne ryche, Who so beheld hem both, Fader ne moder Ã¾at couÃ¾ say Ne knew Ã¾e hend children tway But by Ã¾e coloure of her cloÃ¾. Ãat riche douke his fest gan hold WiÃ¾ erles &amp; wiÃ¾ barouns bold, As ?e may listen &amp; liÃ¾e, Fourtenni?t, as me was told, [With meet and drynke, meryst on mold] To glad Ã¾e bernes bliÃ¾e; Ãer was mirÃ¾e &amp; melodye &amp; al maner of menstracie Her craftes for to kiÃ¾e; Opon Ã¾e fiftenday ful ?are Ãai token her leue forto fare &amp; Ã¾onked him mani a siÃ¾e. Ãan Ã¾e lordinges schuld forÃ¾ wende, Ãat riche douke comly of kende Cleped to him Ã¾at tide Ão tvay barouns, Ã¾at were so hende, &amp; prayd hem al-so his frende In court Ã¾ai schuld abide, &amp; lete her tvay sones fre In his seruise wiÃ¾ him to be, Semly to fare bi his side; &amp; he wald dubbe hem kni?tes to &amp; susten hem for euer mo, As lordinges proude in pride. Ãe riche barouns answerd ogain, &amp; her leuedis gan to sain To Ã¾at douke ful ?are Ãat Ã¾ai were boÃ¾e glad &amp; fain Ãat her leuely children tvain In seruise wiÃ¾ him ware.

So wele Ã¾o children loued hem Ã¾o, Nas neuer children loued hem so, NoiÃ¾er in word no in dede; Bitvix hem tvai, of blod &amp; bon, Trewer loue nas neuer non, In gest as so we rede. On a day Ã¾e childer war &amp; wi?t TreweÃ¾es to-gider Ã¾ai gun pli?t, While Ã¾ai mi?t liue &amp; stond Ãat boÃ¾e bi day &amp; bi ni?t, In wele &amp; wo, in wrong &amp; ri?t, Ãat Ã¾ai schuld frely fond To hold to-gider at eueri nede, In word, in werk, in wille, in dede, Where Ã¾at Ã¾ai were in lond, Fro Ã¾at day forward neuer mo Failen oÃ¾er for wele no wo: Ãer-to Ã¾ai held vp her hond.
