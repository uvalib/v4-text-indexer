Amys and Amylion For goddes loue in trinyte Al þat ben hend herkeniþ to me, I pray ?ow, par amoure, What sum-tyme fel be?ond þe see [Of] two barons of grete bounte And men of grete honoure; Her faders were barons hende, Lordinges com of grete kynde And pris men in toun and tour; To here of þese children two How þey were in wele and woo Ywys it is grete doloure. In weele and woo how þey gan wynd &amp; how vnkouth þey were of kynd, Þe children bold of chere, And how þey were good &amp; hend And how ?ong þei becom frend In cort þere þey were, And how þey were made kny?t And how þey were trouþ ply?t, Þe children boþ in fere, And in what lond þei were born And what þe childres name worn Herkeneþ and ?e mow here. In Lumbardy, y vnderstond, Whilom bifel in þat lond, In romance as we reede, Two barouns hend wonyd in lond And had two ladyes free to fond, Þat worthy were in wede; Of her hend ladyes two Twoo knaue childre gat þey þoo Þat dou?ty were of dede, And trew weren in al þing, And þerfore Ihesu, heuyn-king, Ful wel quyted her mede. Þe children-is names, as y ?ow hy?t, In ryme y wol rekene ry?t And tel in my talkyng; Boþ þey were getyn in oo ny?t And on oo day born a-ply?t, For soth with-out lesyng; Þat oon baroun son, ywys Was ycleped childe Amys At his cristenyng; Þat oþur was clepyd Amylyoun, Þat was a childe of grete renoun And com of hy?e ofspryng. The children gon þen þryue, Fairer were neuer noon on lyue, Curtaise, hende, and good; When þey were of ?eres fyue, Alle her kyn was of hem blyþ, So mylde þey were of mood; When þey were seuyn ?ere olde, Grete ioy euery man of hem tolde To beholde þat frely foode; When þey were twel ?ere olde, In al þe londe were noon so bolde, So faire of boon and blood. In þat tyme, y vnderstond, A duk wonyd in þat lond, Prys in toun and toure; Frely he let [sende his sonde], After erles, barouns, fre and bond, And ladies bry?t in boure; A ryche fest he wolde make Al for Ihesu Cristes sake Þat is oure sauyoure; Muche folk, as y ?ow saye, He lete after sende þat daye With myrth [and] grete honoure. Thoo barouns twoo, þat y of tolde, And her sones feire and bolde To court þey com ful ?are. When þey were comyn, ?ong and olde, Mony men gan hem byholde Of lordynges þat þere were, Of body how wel þey were py?t, And how feire þey were of sy?t, Of hyde and hew and here; And al þey seide with-out lesse Fairer children þan þey wesse Ne sey þey neuer ?ere. In al þe court was þer no wy?t, Erl, baroun, squyer, ne kny?t, Neither lef ne loothe, So lyche þey were both of sy?t And of waxing, y ?ow ply?t— I tel ?ow for soothe— In al þing þey were so lyche Þer was neither pore ne ryche, Who so beheld hem both, Fader ne moder þat couþ say Ne knew þe hend children tway But by þe coloure of her cloþ. Þat riche douke his fest gan hold Wiþ erles &amp; wiþ barouns bold, As ?e may listen &amp; liþe, Fourtenni?t, as me was told, [With meet and drynke, meryst on mold] To glad þe bernes bliþe; Þer was mirþe &amp; melodye &amp; al maner of menstracie Her craftes for to kiþe; Opon þe fiftenday ful ?are Þai token her leue forto fare &amp; þonked him mani a siþe. Þan þe lordinges schuld forþ wende, Þat riche douke comly of kende Cleped to him þat tide Þo tvay barouns, þat were so hende, &amp; prayd hem al-so his frende In court þai schuld abide, &amp; lete her tvay sones fre In his seruise wiþ him to be, Semly to fare bi his side; &amp; he wald dubbe hem kni?tes to &amp; susten hem for euer mo, As lordinges proude in pride. Þe riche barouns answerd ogain, &amp; her leuedis gan to sain To þat douke ful ?are Þat þai were boþe glad &amp; fain Þat her leuely children tvain In seruise wiþ him ware. Þai ?aue her childer her blisceing &amp; bisou?t Ihesu, heuen king, He schuld scheld hem fro care, &amp; oft þai þonked þe douke þat day &amp; token her leue &amp; went oway, To her owen cuntres þai gun fare. Þus war þo hende childer, ywis, Child Amiloun &amp; child Amis, In court frely to fede, To ride an hunting vnder riis; Ouer al þe lond þan were þai priis &amp; worþliest in wede. So wele þo children loued hem þo, Nas neuer children loued hem so, Noiþer in word no in dede; Bitvix hem tvai, of blod &amp; bon, Trewer loue nas neuer non, In gest as so we rede. On a day þe childer war &amp; wi?t Treweþes to-gider þai gun pli?t, While þai mi?t liue &amp; stond Þat boþe bi day &amp; bi ni?t, In wele &amp; wo, in wrong &amp; ri?t, Þat þai schuld frely fond To hold to-gider at eueri nede, In word, in werk, in wille, in dede, Where þat þai were in lond, Fro þat day forward neuer mo Failen oþer for wele no wo: Þer-to þai held vp her hond. Þus in gest as ?e may here, Þo hende childer in cuntre were, Wiþ þat douke for to abide; Þe douke was bliþe &amp; glad of chere, Þai were him boþe leue &amp; dere, Semly to fare bi his side. Þo þai were fiften winter old, He dubbed boþe þo bernes bold To kni?tes in þat tide, &amp; fond hem al þat hem was nede, Hors &amp; wepen &amp; worþly wede, As princes prout in pride. Þat riche douke, he loued hem so, Al þat þai wald he fond hem þo, Boþe stedes white &amp; broun, Þat in what stede þai gun go, Alle þe lond spac of hem þo, Boþe in tour &amp; toun; In to what stede þat þai went, To iustes oþer to turnament, Sir Amis &amp; sir Amiloun, For douhtiest in eueri dede, Wiþ scheld &amp; spere to ride on stede, Þai gat hem gret renoun. Þat riche douke hadde of hem pris, For þat þai were so war &amp; wiis &amp; holden of gret bounte. Sir Amiloun and sir Amis, He sett hem boþe in gret office, In his court for to be; Sir Amis, as ?e may here, He made his chef botelere, [For he was hend and fre,] &amp; sir Amiloun of hem alle He made chef steward in halle, To di?t al his meine. In to her seruise when þai were brou?t, To geten hem los þam spared nou?t, Wel hendeliche þai bigan; Wiþ riche &amp; pouer so wele þai wrou?t, Al þat hem sei?e wiþ word &amp; þou?t, Hem loued mani a man; For þai were so bliþe of chere, Ouer al þe lond fer &amp; nere Þe los of loue þai wan, &amp; þe riche douke, wiþ-outen les, Of alle þe men þat oliue wes Mest he loued hem þan. Þan hadde þe douke, ich vnderstond, A chef steward of alle his lond, A douhti kni?t at crie, Þat euer he proued wiþ niþe &amp; ond For to haue brou?t hem boþe to schond Wiþ gile &amp; trecherie. For þai were so gode &amp; hende, &amp; for þe douke was so wele her frende, He hadde þer-of gret envie; To þe douke wiþ wordes grame Euer he proued to don hem schame Wiþ wel gret felonie. So wiþ-in þo ?eres to A messanger þer com þo To sir Amiloun, hende on hond, &amp; seyd hou deþ hadde fet him fro His fader &amp; his moder al-so Þurch þe grace of godes sond. Þan was þat kni?t a careful man, To þat douke he went him þan &amp; dede him to vnderstond His fader &amp; his moder hende War ded, &amp; he most hom wende, For to resaiue his lond. Þat riche douke, comly of kende, Answerd o?ain wiþ wordes hende &amp; seyd, “So god me spede, Sir Amiloun, now þou schalt wende Me nas neuer so wo for frende Þat of mi court out ?ede. Ac ?if euer it bifalle so Þat þou art in wer &amp; wo &amp; of min help hast nede, Saueliche com or send þi sond, &amp; wiþ al mi powere of mi lond Y schal wreke þe of þat dede. Þan was sir Amiloun ferli wo For to wende sir Amis fro, On him was al his þou?t. To a gold-smitþe he gan go &amp; lete make gold coupes to, For þrehundred pounde he hem bou?t, Þat boþe were of o wi?t, &amp; boþe of o michel, ypli?t; Ful richeliche þai were wrou?t, &amp; boþe þai weren as liche, ywis, As was Sir Amiloun &amp; sir Amis, Þer no failed ri?t nou?t. When þat sir Amiloun was al ?are, He tok his leue for to fare, To wende in his iorne. Sir Amis was so ful of care, For sorwe &amp; wo &amp; sikeing sare Al-mest swoned þat fre. To þe douke he went wiþ dreri mode &amp; praid him fair, þer he stode, &amp; seyd, “Sir, par charite, ?if me leue to wende þe fro, Bot ?if y may wiþ mi broþer go, Mine hert, it brekeþ of þre!” Þat riche douke, comly of kende, Answerd o?ain wiþ wordes hende &amp; seyd wiþ-outen delay, “Sir Amis, mi gode frende, Wold ?e boþe now fro me wende? Certes,” he seyd, “nay! Were ?e boþe went me fro, Þan schuld me waken al mi wo, Mi ioie were went oway. Þi broþer schal in to his cuntre; Wende wiþ him in his iurne &amp; com o?ain þis day!” When þai were redi forto ride, Þo bold bernes for to abide Busked hem redy boun. Hende, herkeneþ! Is nou?t to hide, So douhti kni?tes, in þat tide Þat ferd out of þat toun, Al þat day as þai rade Gret morning boþe þai made, Sir Amis &amp; Amiloun, &amp; when þai schuld wende otvain, Wel fair to-gider opon a plain Of hors þai li?t adoun. When þai were boþe a-fot li?t, Sir Amiloun, þat hendi kni?t, Was ri?t-wise man of rede &amp; seyd to sir Amis ful ri?t, “Broþer as we er trewþe-pli?t Boþe wiþ word &amp; dede, Fro þis day forward neuer mo To faily oþer for wele no wo, To help him at his nede, Broþer, be now trewe to me, &amp; y schal ben as trewe to þe, Also god me spede! Ac broþer, ich warn þe biforn, For his loue, þat bar þe croun of þorn To saue al man-kende, Be nou?t o?ain þi lord forsworn, &amp; ?if þou dost, þou art forlorn Euer more wiþ-outen ende. Bot euer do trewþe &amp; no tresoun &amp; þenk on me, sir Amiloun, Now we asondri schal wende. &amp;, broþer, ?ete y þe forbede Þe fals steward felawerede, Certes, he wil þe schende!” As þai stode so, þo breþeren bold, [Sir Amiloun] drou? forþ tvay coupes of gold, Ware liche in al þing, &amp; bad sir Amis þat he schold Chese wheþer he haue wold, Wiþ-outen more duelling, &amp; seyd to him, “Mi leue broþer, Kepe þou þat on &amp; y þat oþer, For godes loue, heuen king; Lete neuer þis coupe fro þe, Bot loke her-on &amp; þenk on me, It tokneþ our parting.” Gret sorwe þai made at her parting &amp; kisten hem wiþ ei?en wepeing, Þo kni?tes hende &amp; fre. Aiþer bitau?t oþer heuen king, &amp; on her stedes þai gun spring &amp; went in her iurne. Sir Amiloun went hom to his lond &amp; sesed it al in to his hond, Þat his elders hadde be, &amp; spoused a leuedy bri?t in bour &amp; brou?t hir hom wiþ gret honour &amp; miche solempnete. Lete we sir Amiloun stille be Wiþ his wiif in his cuntre— God leue hem wele to fare— &amp; of sir Amis telle we; When he com hom to court o?e, Ful bliþe of him þai ware; For þat he was so hende &amp; gode, Men blisced him, boþe bon &amp; blod, Þat euer him gat &amp; bare, Saue þe steward of þat lond, Euer he proued wiþ niþe &amp; ond To bring him in-to care. Þan on a day bifel it so Wiþ þe steward he met þo, Ful fair he gret þat fre. “Sir Amis,” he seyd, “þe is ful wo For þat þi broþer is went þe fro, &amp;, certes, so is me. Ac of his wendeing haue þou no care, ?if þou wilt leue opon mi lare, &amp; lete þi morning be, &amp; þou wil be to me kende, Y schal þe be a better frende Þan euer ?ete was he. “Sir Amis,” he seyd, “do bi mi red, &amp; swere ous boþe broþerhed &amp; pli?t we our trewþes to; Be trewe to me in word &amp; dede, &amp; y schal, so god me spede, Be trewe to þe al so.” Sir Amis answerd, “Mi treuþe y pli?t To sir Amiloun, þe gentil kni?t, Þei he be went me fro. Whiles þat y may gon &amp; speke, Y no schal neuer mi treuþe breke, Noiþer for wele no wo. For bi þe treuþe þat god me sende, Ichaue him founde so gode &amp; kende, Seþþen þat y first him knewe, For ones y pli?t him treuþe, þat hende, Where so he in warld wende, Y schal be to him trewe; &amp; ?if y were now forsworn &amp; breke mi treuþe, y were forlorn, Wel sore it schuld me rewe. Gete me frendes whare y may, Y no schal neuer bi ni?t no day Chaunge him for no newe.” Þe steward þan was egre of mode, Al-mest for wretþe he wex ner wode &amp; seyd, wiþ-outen delay, &amp; swore bi him þat dyed on rode: “Þou traitour, vnkinde blod, Þou schalt abigge þis nay.

He nist what him was best to don, To flen, oþer to fi?ting gon; In hert him liked ille. He þou?t, “?if y beknowe mi name, Þan schal mi broþer go to schame, Wiþ sorwe þai schul him spille. Certes,” he seyd, “for drede of care To hold mi treuþe schal y nou?t spare, Lete god don alle his wille.” Al þe folk þer was, ywis, Þai wend it had ben sir Amis Þat bataile schuld bede; He and þe steward of pris Were brou?t bifor þe iustise To swere for þat dede. Þe steward swore þe pople among, As wis as he seyd no wrong, God help him at his nede; &amp; sir Amiloun swore &amp; gan to say As wis as he neuer kist þat may, Our leuedi schuld him spede. When þai hadde sworn, as y ?ou told, To biker þo bernes were ful bold &amp; busked hem for to ride. Al þat þer was, ?ong &amp; old, Bisou?t god ?if þat he wold Help sir Amis þat tide. On stedes þat were stiþe &amp; strong Þai riden to-gider wiþ schaftes long, Til þai toschiuerd bi ich a side; &amp; þan drou? þai swerdes gode &amp; hewe to-gider, as þai were wode, For noþing þai nold abide. Þo gomes, þat were egre of si?t, Wiþ fauchouns felle þai gun to fi?t &amp; ferd as þai were wode. So hard þai hewe on helmes bri?t Wiþ strong strokes of michel mi?t, Þat fer bi-forn out stode; So hard þai hewe on helme &amp; side, Þurch dent of grimly woundes wide, Þat þai sprad al of blod. Fram morwe to none, wiþ-outen faile, Bitvixen hem last þe bataile, So egre þai were of mode. Sir Amiloun, as fer of flint, Wiþ wretþe anon to him he wint &amp; smot a stroke wiþ main; Ac he failed of his dint, Þe stede in þe heued he hint &amp; smot out al his brain. Þe stede fel ded doun to grounde; Þo was þe steward þat stounde Ful ferd he schuld be slain. Sir Amiloun li?t adoun of his stede, To þe steward a-fot he ?ede &amp; halp him vp ogain. “Arise vp, steward,” he seyd anon, “To fi?t þou schalt a-fot gon, For þou hast lorn þi stede; For it were gret vilani, bi Seyn Jon, A liggeand man for to slon, Þat were yfallen in nede.” Þat kni?t was ful fre to fond &amp; tok þe steward bi þe hond &amp; seyd, “So god me spede, Now þou schalt a-fot go, Y schal fi?t a-fot al-so, &amp; elles were gret falshed.” Þe steward &amp; þat douhti man Anon to-gider þai fi?t gan Wiþ brondes bri?t &amp; bare; So hard to-gider þai fi?t þan, Til al her armour o blod ran, For noþing nold þai spare. Þe steward smot to him þat stounde On his schulder a gret wounde Wiþ his grimly gare, Þat þurch þat wounde, as ?e may here, He was knowen wiþ reweli chere, When he was fallen in care. Þan was sir Amiloun wroþ &amp; wode, Whan al his armour ran o blode, Þat ere was white so swan; Wiþ a fauchoun scharp &amp; gode He smot to him wiþ egre mode Al so a douhti man, Þat euen fro þe schulder-blade In-to þe brest þe brond gan wade, Þurch-out his hert it ran.

Anon þai ladde him to þe tour Wiþ ioie &amp; ful michel honour, As prince proude in pride. In to þe palais when þai were gon, Al þat was in þat worþli won Wende sir Amis it ware. “Sir Amis,” seyd þe douke anon, “Bifor þis lordinges euerichon Y graunt þe ful ?are, For Belisent, þat miri may, Þou hast bou?t hir ful dere to day Wiþ grimli woundes sare; Þer-fore y graunt þe now here Mi lond &amp; mi douhter dere, To hald for euer mare.” Ful bliþe was þat hendi kni?t &amp; þonked him wiþ al his mi?t, Glad he was &amp; fain; In alle þe court was þer no wi?t Þat wist wat his name it hi?t, To saue þo leuedis tvain, Leches swiþe þai han yfounde, Þat gun to tasty his wounde &amp; made him hole ogain, Þan were þai al glad &amp; bliþe &amp; þonked god a þousand siþe Þat þe steward was slain. On a day sir Amiloun di?t him ?are &amp; seyd þat he wold fare Hom in to his cuntray To telle his frendes, lasse &amp; mare, &amp; oþer lordinges þat þere ware, Hou he had sped þat day.

Þe leuedi astite asked him þo Whi þat he hadde farn so Al þat fourtenni?t, Laid his swerd bitven hem to, Þat sche no durst nou?t for wele no wo Touche his bodi ari?t.

So wicked &amp; schrewed was his wiif, Sche brac his hert wiþ-outen kniif, Wiþ wordes harde &amp; kene, &amp; seyd to him, “Þou wreche chaitif, Wiþ wrong þe steward les his liif, &amp; þat is on þe sene; Þer-fore, bi Seyn Denis of Fraunce, Þe is bitid þis hard chaunce, Daþet who þe bimene!” Wel oft times his honden he wrong, As man þat þenkeþ his liif to long, Þat liueþ in treye &amp; tene.

Bi þan þe tvelmoneþ was al gon, Amorant went in-to þat won For his lordes liueray; Þe leuedi was ful wroþ anon &amp; comaunde hir men euerichon To driue þat child oway, &amp; swore bi him þat Judas sold, Þei his lord for hunger &amp; cold Dyed þer he lay, He schuld haue noiþer mete no drink, No socour of non oþer þing For hir after þat day.

Þan Amoraunt crud sir Amiloun Þurch mani a cuntre, vp &amp; doun, As ?e may vnderstond; So he com to a cite toun, Þer sir Amis, þe bold baroun, Was douke &amp; lord in lond. Þan seyd þe kni?t in þat tide, “To þe doukes court here biside To bring me þider þou fond; He is a man of milde mode, We schul gete ous þer sum gode Þurch grace of godes sond. “Ac, leue sone,” he seyd þan, “For his loue, þat þis world wan Astow art hende &amp; fre, Þou be aknowe to no man Whider y schal, no whenes y cam, No what mi name it be.” He answerd &amp; seyd, “Nay.” To court he went in his way, As ?e may listen at me, &amp; bifor al oþer pouer men He crud his wain in to þe fen; Gret diol it was to se. So it bifel þat selue day,— Wiþ tong as y ?ou tel may,— It was midwinter tide, Þat riche douke wiþ gamen &amp; play Fram chirche com þe ri?t way As lord &amp; prince wiþ pride. When he com to þe castel-gate, Þe pouer men þat stode þer-ate Wiþdrou? hem þer beside. Wiþ kni?tes &amp; wiþ seriaunce fale He went in-to þat semly sale Wiþ ioie &amp; blis to abide. In kinges court, as it is lawe, Trumpes in halle to mete gan blawe, To benche went þo bold. When þai were semly set on rowe, Serued þai were opon a þrowe, As men miriest on mold. Þat riche douke, wiþ-outen les, As a prince serued he wes Wiþ riche coupes of gold, &amp; he þat brou?t him to þat state Stode bischet wiþ-outen þe gate, Wel sore of-hungred &amp; cold. Out at þe gate com a kni?t &amp; a seriaunt wise &amp; wi?t, To plain hem boþe yfere, &amp; þurch þe grace of god almi?t On sir Amiloun he cast a si?t, Hou laiþ he was of chere. &amp; seþþen biheld on Amoraunt, Hou gentil he was &amp; of fair semblaunt, In gest as ?e may here. Þan seyd þai boþe, bi Seyn Jon, In al þe court was þer non Of fairehed half his pere. Þe gode man gan to him go, &amp; hendeliche he asked him þo, As ?e may vnderstond, Fram wat lond þat he com fro, &amp; whi þat he stode þer þo, &amp; whom he serued in lond. “Sir,” he seyd, “so god me saue, Icham here mi lordes knaue, Þat liþ in godes bond; &amp; þou art gentil kni?t of blode, Bere our erand of sum gode Þurch grace of godes sond.” Þe gode man asked him anon, ?if he wald fro þat lazer gon &amp; trewelich to him take; &amp; he seyd he schuld, bi Seyn Jon, Serue þat riche douke in þat won, &amp; richeman he wald him make; &amp; he answerd wiþ mild mode &amp; swore bi him þat dyed on rode Whiles he mi?t walk &amp; wake, For to winne al þis warldes gode, His hende lord, þat bi him stode, Schuld he neuer forsake. Þe gode man wende he hadde ben rage, Or he hadde ben a fole-sage Þat hadde his witt forlorn, Oþer he þou?t þat his lord wiþ þe foule visage Hadde ben a man of hei?e parage &amp; of hei?e kinde ycorn. Þer-fore he nold no more sain, Bot went him in to þe halle ogain Þe riche douke biforn, “Mi lord,” he seyd, “listen to me Þe best bourd, bi mi leuete, Þou herdest seþþen þou were born.” Þe riche douke badde him anon To telle bi-forn hem euerichon Wiþ-outen more duelling. “Now sir,” he seyd, “bi Seyn Jon, Ich was out atte gate ygon Ri?t now on mi playing; Pouer men y sei?e mani þare, Litel &amp; michel, lasse &amp; mare, Boþe old &amp; ?ing, &amp; a lazer þer y fond; Herdestow neuer in no lond Telle of so foule a þing. “Þe lazer liþ vp in a wain, &amp; is so pouer of mi?t &amp; main O fot no may he gon; &amp; ouer him stode a naked swain, A gentiler child, for soþe to sain, In world no wot y non. He is þe fairest gome Þat euer Crist ?af cristendome Or layd liif opon, &amp; on of þe most fole he is Þat euer þou herdest speke, ywis, In þis worldes won.” Þan seyd þe riche douke ogain, “What foly,” he seyd, “can he sain? Is he madde of mode?” “Sir,” he seyd, “y bad him fain Forsake þe lazer in þe wain, Þat he so ouer stode, &amp; in þi seruise he schuld be, Y bihete him boþe lond &amp; fe, Anou? of warldes gode; &amp; he answerd &amp; seyd þo He nold neuer gon him fro; Þer-fore ich hold him wode.” Þan seyd þe douke, “Þei his lord be lorn, Par auentour, þe gode man haþ biforn Holpen him at his nede, Oþer þe child is of his blod yborn, Oþer he haþ him oþes sworn His liif wiþ him to lede. Wheþer he be fremd or of his blod, Þe child,” he seyd, “is trewe &amp; gode, Also god me spede. ?if ichim speke er he wende, For þat he is so trewe &amp; kende, Y schal quite him his mede!” Þat douke astite, as y ?ou told, Cleped to him a squier bold &amp; hendelich gan him sain: “Take,” he sayd, “mi coupe of gold, As ful of wine astow mi?t hold In þine hondes tvain, &amp; bere it to þe castel-?ate, A lazer þou schalt finde þerate Liggeand in a wain. Bid him, for þe loue of Seyn Martin, He and his page drink þis win, &amp; bring me þe coupe ogain.” Þe squier þo þe coupe hent, &amp; to þe castel-gat he went, &amp; ful of win he it bare. To þe lazer he seyd, verrament, “Þis coupe ful of win mi lord þe sent, Drink it, ?iue þou dare.” Þe lazer tok forþ his coupe of gold, Boþe were ?oten in o mold, Ri?t as þat selue it ware, Þer-in he pourd þat win so riche; Þan were þai boþe ful yliche &amp; noiþer lesse no mare. Þe squier biheld þe coupes þo, First his &amp; his lordes al-so, Whiles he stode hem biforn, Ac he no couþe neuer mo Chese þe better of hem to, So liche boþe þai worn. In-to halle he ran ogain, “Certes, sir,” he gan to sain, “Mani gode dede þou hast lorn, &amp; so þou hast lorn þis dede now; He is a richer man þan þou, Bi þe time þat god was born.” Þe riche douke answerd, “Nay. Þat worþ neuer bi ni?t no day, It were o?aines þe lawe!” “?is, sir,” he gan to say, “He is a traitour, bi mi fay, &amp; were wele worþ to drawe. For when y brou?t him þe win, He drou? forþ a gold coupe fin, Ri?t as it ware þi nawe; In þis world, bi Seyn Jon, So wise a man is þer non Asundri schuld hem knawe.” “Now, certes,” seyd sir Amis þo, “In al þis world were coupes nomo So liche in al þing, Saue min &amp; mi broþers al-so, Þat was sett bitvix ous to, Token of our parting; &amp; ?if it be so, wiþ tresoun Mine hende broþer, sir Amiloun, Is slain, wiþ-outen lesing. &amp; ?if he haue stollen his coupe oway, Y schal him sle me self þis day, Bi Ihesu, heuen king!” Fram þe bord he resed þan &amp; hent his swerd as a wode man &amp; drou? it out wiþ wrake, &amp; to þe castel gat he ran; In al þe court was þer no man Þat him mi?t atake. To þe lazer he stirt in þe wain &amp; hent him in his honden tvain &amp; sleynt him in þe lake, &amp; layd on, as he were wode, &amp; al þat euer about him stode Gret diol gan make. “Traitour!” seyd þe douke so bold, “Where haddestow þis coupe of gold &amp; hou com þou þer to? For bi him at Judas sold, Amiloun, mi broþer, it hadde in wold, When þat he went me fro!” “?a, certes, sir,” he gan to say, “It was his in his cuntray, &amp; now it is fallen so; Bot certes, now þat icham here, Þe coupe is mine, y bou?t it dere, Wiþ ri?t y com þer to.” Þan was þe douke ful egre of mod; Was noman þat about him stode Þat durst legge on him hond; He spurned him wiþ his fot &amp; laid on, as he were wode, Wiþ his naked brond, &amp; bi þe fet þe lazer he drou? &amp; drad on him in þe slou?; For no þing wald he wond, &amp; seyd, “Þef, þou schalt be slawe, Bot þou wilt be þe soþe aknawe, Where þou þe coupe fond.” Child Amoraunt stode þe pople among &amp; seye his lord wiþ wou? &amp; wrong Hou reweliche he was di?t. He was boþe hardi &amp; strong, Þe douke in his armes he fong &amp; held him stille vp-ri?t. “Sir,” he seyd, “þou art vnhende &amp; of þi werkes vnkende, To sle þat gentil kni?t. Wel sore may him rewe þat stounde Þat euer for þe toke he wounde To saue þi liif in fi?t. “And ys thi brother, sir Amylioun, That whilom was a noble baroun Bothe to ryde and go, And now with sorwe ys dreue adoun; Nowe god þat suffred passioun Breng him oute of his wo! For the of blysse he ys bare, And thou yeldyst him all with care And brekest his bones a two; That he halp the at thi nede, Well euell aquitest thou his mede, Alas, whi farest thou so?” When sir Amis herd him so sain, He stirt to þe kni?t ogain, Wiþ-outen more delay, &amp; biclept him in his armes tvain, &amp; oft, “Allas!” he gan sain; His song was “Waileway!” He loked opon his scholder bare &amp; sei?e his grimly wounde þare, As Amoraunt gan him say. He fel aswon to þe grounde &amp; oft he seyd, “Allas þat stounde!” Þat euer he bode þat day. “Allas,” he seyd, “mi ioie is lorn, Vnkender blod nas neuer born, Y not wat y may do; For he saued mi liif biforn, Ichaue him ?olden wiþ wo &amp; sorn &amp; wrou?t him michel wo. “O broþer,” he seyd, “par charite, Þis rewely dede for?if þou me, Þat ichaue smiten þe so!” &amp; he for?aue it him also swiþe &amp; kist him wel mani a siþe, Wepeand wiþ ei?en tvo. Þan was sir Amis glad &amp; fain, For ioie he wepe wiþ his ain &amp; hent his broþer þan, &amp; tok him in his armes tvain, Ri?t til he come in-to þe halle o?ain, No bar him no noþer man. Þe leuedi þo in þe halle stode &amp; wend hir lord hadde ben wode, O?aines him hye ran. “Sir,” sche seyd, “wat is þi þou?t? Whi hastow him in-to halle ybrou?t, For him þat þis world wan?” “O dame,” he seyd, “bi Seyn Jon, Me nas neuer so wo bigon, ?if þou it wost vnderstond, For better kni?t in world is non, Bot al-most now ichaue him slon &amp; schamely driuen to schond; For it is mi broþer, sir Amiloun, Wiþ sorwe &amp; care is dreuen adoun, Þat er was fre to fond.” Þe leuedi fel aswon to grounde &amp; wepe &amp; seyd, “Allas þat stounde!” Wel sore wrengand hir hond. As foule a lazer as he was, Þe leuedi kist him in þat plas, For noþing wold sche spare, &amp; oft time sche seyd, “Allas!” Þat him was fallen so hard a cas, To liue in sorwe &amp; care. Into hir chaumber she gan him lede &amp; kest of al his pouer wede &amp; baþed his bodi al bare, &amp; to a bedde swiþe him brou?t Wiþ cloþes riche &amp; wele ywrou?t; Ful bliþe of him þai ware. &amp; þus in gest as we say, Tvelmoneþ in her chaumber he lay, Ful trewe þai ware &amp; kinde. No wold þai nick him wiþ no nay, What so euer he asked ni?t or day, It nas neuer bihinde; Of euerich mete &amp; eueri drink Þai had hem-selue, wiþ-outen lesing, Þai were him boþe ful minde. &amp; biþan þe tvelmonþ was ago, A ful fair grace fel hem þo, In gest as we finde. So it bifel opon a ni?t, As sir Amis, þat gentil kni?t, In slepe þou?t as he lay, An angel com fram heuen bri?t &amp; stode biforn his bed ful ri?t &amp; to him þus gan say: ?if he wald rise on Cristes morn, Swiche time as Ihesu Crist was born, &amp; slen his children tvay, &amp; alien his [broþer] wiþ þe blode, Þurch godes grace, þat is so gode, His wo schuld wende oway. Þus him þou?t al þo þre ni?t An angel out of heuen bri?t Warned him euer more ?if he wald do as he him hi?t, His broþer schuld ben as fair a kni?t As euer he was biforn, Ful bliþe was sir Amis þo, Ac for his childer him was ful wo, For fairer ner non born. Wel loþ him was his childer to slo, &amp; wele loþer his broþer forgo, Þat is so kinde ycorn. Sir Amiloun met þat ni?t also Þat an angel warned him þo &amp; seyd to him ful ?are, ?if his broþer wald his childer slo, Þe hert blod of hem to Mi?t bring him out of care. A morwe sir Amis was ful hende &amp; to his broþer he gan wende &amp; asked him of his fare; &amp; he him answerd o?ain ful stille, “Broþer, ich abide her godes wille, For y may do na mare.” Al so þai sete to-gider þare &amp; speke of auentours, as it ware, Þo kni?tes hende &amp; fre, Þan seyd sir Amiloun ful ?are, “Broþer, y nil nou?t spare To tel þe in priuite Me þou?t to-ni?t in mi sweuen Þat an angel com fram heuen; For soþe, he told me Þat þurch þe blod of [þin] children to Y mi?t aschape out of mi wo, Al hayl &amp; hole to be!” Þan þou?t þe douk, wiþ-outen lesing, For to slen his childer so ?ing, It were a dedli sinne; &amp; þan þou?t he, bi heuen king, His broþer out of sorwe bring, For þat nold he nou?t blinne. So it bifel on Cristes ni?t, Swiche time as Ihesu, ful of mi?t, Was born to saue man-kunne, To chirche to wende al þat þer wes, Þai di?ten hem, wiþ-outen les, Wiþ ioie &amp; worldes winne. Þan þai were redi for to fare, Þe douke bad al þat þer ware, To chirche þai schuld wende, Litel &amp; michel, lasse &amp; mare, Þat non bileft in chaumber þare, As þai wald ben his frende, &amp; seyd he wald him-selue þat ni?t Kepe his broþer þat gentil kni?t Þat was so god &amp; kende. Þan was þer non þat durst say nay; To chirche þai went in her way, At hom bileft þo hende. Þe douke wel fast gan aspie Þe kays of þe noricerie, Er þan þai schuld gon, &amp; priueliche he cast his ei?e &amp; aparceiued ful witterlye Where þat þai hadde hem don. &amp; when þai were to chirche went, Þan sir Amis, verrament, Was bileft al-on. He tok a candel fair &amp; bri?t &amp; to þe kays he went ful ri?t &amp; tok hem oway ichon. Alon him self, wiþ-outen mo, Into þe chaumber he gan to go, Þer þat his childer were, &amp; biheld hem boþe to, Hou fair þai lay to-gider þo &amp; slepe boþe yfere. Þan seyd him-selue, “Bi Seyn Jon, It were gret reweþe ?ou to slon, Þat god haþ bou?t so dere!” His kniif he had drawen þat tide, For sorwe he sleynt oway biside &amp; wepe wiþ reweful chere. Þan he hadde wopen þer he stode, Anon he turned o?ain his mode &amp; sayd wiþ-outen delay, “Mi broþer was so kinde &amp; gode, Wiþ grimly wounde he schad his blod For mi loue opon a day; Whi schuld y þan mi childer spare, To bring mi broþer out of care? O, certes,” he seyd, “nay! To help mi broþer now at þis nede, God graunt me þer-to wele to spede, &amp; Mari, þat best may!” No lenger stint he no stode, Bot hent his kniif wiþ dreri mode &amp; tok his children þo; For he nold nou?t spille her blode, Ouer a bacine fair &amp; gode Her þrotes he schar atvo. &amp; when he hadde hem boþe slain, He laid hem in her bed ogain, —No wonder þei him were wo— &amp; hilde hem, þat no wi?t schuld se, As noman hadde at hem be; Out of chaumber he gan go. &amp; when he was out of chaumber gon, Þe dore he steked stille anon As fast as it was biforn; Þe kays he hidde vnder a ston &amp; þou?t þai schuld wene ichon Þat þai hadde ben forlorn. To his broþer he went him þan &amp; seyd to þat careful man, “Swiche time as god was born, Ich haue þe brou?t mi childer blod, Ich hope it schal do þe gode As þe angel seyd biforn.” “Broþer,” sir Amiloun gan to say, “Hastow slayn þine children tvay? Allas, whi destow so?” He wepe &amp; seyd, “Waileway! Ich had leuer til domesday Haue liued in care &amp; wo!” Þan seyd sir Amis, “Be now stille; Ihesu, when it is his wille, May send me childer mo. For me of blis þou art al bare; Ywis, mi liif wil y nou?t spare, To help þe now þer-fro.” He tok þat blode, þat was so bri?t, &amp; alied þat gentil kni?t, Þat er was hend in hale, &amp; seþþen in bed him di?t &amp; wrei?e him wel warm, apli?t, Wiþ cloþes riche &amp; fale. “Broþer,” he seyd, “ly now stille &amp; falle on slepe þurch godes wille, As þe angel told in tale; &amp; ich hope wele wiþ-outen lesing, Ihesu, þat is heuen king, Schal bote þe of þi bale.” Sir Amis let him ly alon &amp; in to his chapel he went anon, In gest as ?e may here, &amp; for his childer, þat he hadde slon, To god of heuen he made his mon &amp; preyd wiþ rewely chere Schuld saue him fram schame þat day, &amp; Mari, his moder, þat best may, Þat was him leue &amp; dere; &amp; Ihesu Crist, in þat stede Ful wele he herd þat kni?tes bede &amp; graunt him his praiere. A morwe astite as it was day, Þe leuedi com home al wiþ play Wiþ kni?tes ten &amp; fiue; Þai sou?t þe kays þer þai lay; Þai founde hem nou?t, þai were oway, Wel wo was hem o-liue. Þe douk bad al þat þer wes Þai schuld hold hem still in pes &amp; stint of her striue, &amp; seyd he hadde þe keys nome, Schuld noman in þe chaumber come Bot him self &amp; his wiue. Anon he tok his leuedi þan &amp; seyd to hir, “Leue leman, Be bliþe &amp; glad of mode; For bi him þat þis warld wan, Boþe mi childer ich haue slan, Þat were so hende &amp; gode; For me þou?t in mi sweuen Þat an angel com fram heuen &amp; seyd me þurch her blode Mi broþer schuld passe out of his wo; Þer-fore y slou? hem boþe to, To hele þat frely fode.” Þan was þe leuedi ferly wo &amp; sei?e hir lord was al-so; Sche comfort him ful ?are, “O lef liif,” sche seyd þo, “God may sende ous childer mo, Of hem haue þou no care. ?if it ware at min hert rote, For to bring þi broþer bote, My lyf y wold not spare. Shal noman oure children see, To-morrow shal þey beryed bee As þey faire ded ware!” Þus þe lady faire &amp; bry?t Comfort hur lord with al hur my?t, As ?e mow vnderstonde; And seth þey went boþ ful ry?t To sir Amylion, þat gentyl kny?t, Þat ere was free to fonde. When sir Amylion wakyd þoo, Al his fowlehed was agoo Þrou? grace of goddes sonde; Þan was he as feire a man As euer he was ?et or þan, Seþ he was born in londe. Þan were þey al bliþ, Her ioy couþ noman kyth, Þey þonked god þat day. As ?e mow listen and lyth, Into a chamber þey went swyþ, Þer þe children lay; With-out wemme and wound Hool and sound þe children found, And layen to-geder and play. For ioye þey wept, þere þey stood, And þanked god with myld mood, Her care was al [away]. When sir Amylion was hool &amp; fere And wax was strong of powere Boþ to goo and ryde, Child Oweys was a bold squyer, Blithe and glad he was of chere, To serue his lord beside. Þan saide þe kny?t vppon a day, He wolde hoom to his contray, To speke with his wyf þat tyde; And for she halp him so at nede, Wel he þou?t to quyte hur mede, No lenger wold he abyde. Sir Amys sent ful hastely After mony kny?t hardy, Þat dou?ty were of dede, Wel fyue hundred kene and try, And other barons by and by On palfray and on steed. He preked both ny?t and day Til he com to his contray, Þer he was lord in lede. Þan had a kny?t of þat contre Spoused his lady, bry?t of ble, In romaunce as we rede. But þus, in romaunce as y ?ow say, Þey com hoom þat silf day Þat þe bridal was hold; To þe ?ates þey preked with-out delay, Anon þer began a soory play Among þe barouns bold. A messengere to þe hal com And seide her lord was com hom As man meriest on molde. Þan wox þe lady blew and wan, Þer was mony a sory man, Boþ ?ong and olde. Sir Amys and sir Amylion And with hem mony a stout baron With kny?tes &amp; squyers fale, With helmes &amp; with haberyon, With swerd bry?t and broun, Þey went in to þe hale. Al þat þey þere arau?t, Grete strokes þere þey cau?t, Boþ grete and smale. Glad and blyþ were þey þat day, Who so my?t skape away [And fle fro that bredale]. [When thei had with wrake Droue oute both broun and blake] Out of þat worthy woon, Sir Amylyon for his lady sake &amp; grete logge he let make Boþ of lym and stoon. Þere-yn was þe lady ladde And with bred and water was she fed, Tyl her lyue-days were goon. Þus was þe lady brou?t to dede, Who þerof rou?t, he was a queede, As ?e haue herd echoon. Þen sir Amylion sent his sond To erles, barouns, fre and bond, Boþ feire and hende. When þey com, he sesed in hond Child Oweys in al his lond, Þat was trew and kynde; And when he had do þus, ywys, With his brother, sir Amys, A?en þen gan he wende. In muche ioy with-out stryf To-geder ladde þey her lyf, Tel god after hem dide sende. Anoon þe hend barons tway, Þey let reyse a feire abbay And feffet it ry?t wel þoo, In Lumbardy, in þat contray, To senge for hem tyl domesday And for her eldres also. Boþ on oo day were þey dede And in oo graue were þey leide, Þe kny?tes boþ twoo; And for her trewþ and her godhede Þe blisse of heuyn þey haue to mede, Þat lasteþ euer moo. Amen.</field>
