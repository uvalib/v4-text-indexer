      <field name="fulltext">BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE. When has the day the loveliest of its hours? It is the hour when morning breaks into day, When dew-drops light the yet unfolded flowers, And sunshine seems like Hope upon its way. Then soars the lark amid the azure, singing A seraph's song, that is of heaven, not earth; Then comes the wind, a fragrant wanderer, bringing The breath of vales where violets have birth. Which of the seasons in the year is fairest? That when the spring first blushes into bloom; There is the beauty, earliest and rarest, When the world warms with colour and perfume. Then are the meadows filled with pleasant voices, Earth one bright promise what it is to be; Then the green forest in its depths rejoices, Flowers in the grass, and buds upon the tree. Then the red rose reveals her future glory, Breaking the green moss with one crimson trace; So dawns the white—while old historic story Tells now they wreathe for England's Royal race. If thus so fair the spring-time and the morning But in the world of leaf and bud; how fair, With all their early loveliness adorning, Still lovelier in our human world they are. Youth is around thee, Ladye of the ocean, Ocean that is thy kingdom and thy home, Where not a heart but kindles with emotion, Dreaming of honoured years that are to come. What is the light of morning's rosy breaking, To the young promise of that Royal mind? What are the hopes of sunny spring's awaking, To hopes which in thy future are inshrined? Mighty the task, and glorious the fulfilling, Duties that round thy future hours must be; The East and West depend upon thy willing Mistress art thou wherever rolls the sea. Fair art thou, Princess, in thy youthful beauty Thoughtful and pure, the spirit claims its part; Gazing on thy young face, a nation's duty Bursts forth into the homage of the heart. O'er thy high forehead is the soft hair braided; Be never darker shadow on that brow! Not yet one tint of youth's sweet hues are faded; The loveliness of promise lights thee now. Around thee are a thousand hearts addressing Prayer for thy sake to every power divine; No lip that names thee, names without a blessing; A nation's holiest wishes are all thine. The present looks on thee, with eyes Of love, and joy, and enterprise; They shine as shines a rising star, That lights the unknown and the far. To prophesy the future, cast A glance upon thy country's past. How has our England changed since first The Roman Cæsar on her burst: And something lingers with us still Of their indomitable will. Like theirs, our banners, when unfurled, Have swept o'er half a conquered world. No stranger power hath sought our coast, But to bequeath their proudest boast. Hengist and Horsa, Saxon kings, On their proud galley's sweeping wings: Lords of the banner and the breeze, Gave us our empire o'er the seas; Next came the Norman William's gallant power, Those barons brought a noble dower Of minstrel harp, and stainless sword, High courtesy, and knightly word. Then sea and land had done their best To grace our Island of the West. And never since hath foreign brand Flashed over our unconquered land; Never hath rung the tocsin bell, That other soils have known too well. Sacred, inviolate, unstained, Have England's fields and hearths remained. Our victories have been won afar, Our homes have only heard of war. They gave thy name, and since thy birth Peace, dove-like, broodeth over earth: Still be its shadow o'er thy throne— Enough of laurels are our own. “Enough of laurels are our own”—Conquest is the commencement of civilization; it is also its scourge. With us, the sail and the sword have gone together, and commerce has consolidated what was gained by war. We have now to civilize what we have subdued: it is ours to bestow knowledge, freedom, and faith. Education, settled laws, and Christianity must follow the course of our victories and our manufactures. For us there yet remains A nobler conquest far; We must pay back the past, the debt we owe: Let us around dispense Light, hope, intelligence, Till blessings track our steps where'er we go. O England, thine be the deliverer's meed, Be thy great empire known By hearts made all thine own, Through thy free Laws and thy immortal Creed. With the golden sunbeams shining Round the Abbey's towers, Stands that stately pile enshrining England's noblest hours. There they rest its honoured dead. There the trophies of our annals Fling their shade below, Flags that in our English channels Once announced a foe, Now in triumph are they spread. 'Tis no lesson taught in vain, So would millions die again. In those ancient chancels slumber As within a shrine, Men whom history loves to number On her sacred line, Men who leave themselves behind; Statesmen holding yet dominion With their fellow-men; By the empire of opinion, Ruling them again: For immortal is the mind, And a thoughtful truth maintains Whatsoever ground it gains. Not this the first time that our lion and land Have owned the soft sway of a woman's white hand; She the last branch of the Tudor's proud line Held empire—an omen of glory for thine: The name of Elizabeth tells of an age Alone in its splendour on history's page. 'Twas then the mind burst from its slumbers, and broke The depth of its shade, the weight of its yoke; And thoughts that lay dark, like the seeds in the earth, Sprung up into varied and beautiful birth; Whence, grown mid all changes of good and of ill, We reap a rich harvest for garnering still. For thoughts are like waves that come rushing to shore, One breaks into many—is followed by more; Then came the doomed Spaniard, the last one, whose boast, The white cliffs have echoed that girdle our coast. Each strong as a tower—and stern as a tomb, The death-bearing ships sailed the seas in their gloom; Strange tortures were hid in the depths of each hold, And wealth that might buy her—could England be sold; Then came the proud Queen to the shores of the sea,— She gathered around her the brave and the free; Of all the Armada that darkened the main, No vessel returned to its harbour again; The maidens of Cadiz looked out through their tears, No banner their hand had embroidered appears; They are torn by the winds and the waves, or have been Laid low at the feet of the proud island Queen. 'Twas in a woman's reign uprose That soul of enterprise, Which since has borne our English flag Through foreign seas and skies. Few were the first adventurous barks That ploughed the deep—but now What breeze but bears St. George's cross, What shore but knows our prow? And more than glory, or than gold, May British merchants say; Look on what blessings infinite Have followed on our way. To civilize and to redeem Has been our generous toil, To sow the seeds of future good In many a thankful soil. Where'er to dark and pagan lands Our path has been decreed, Have we not brought the Christian's hope, The Christian's holy creed? 'Tis from a woman's glorious reign Our English isles may date The honours of their after hours, The triumphs of their state. And yet how much remains to do, How much is left behind! Young daughter of a line of kings, Much is to thee assigned. Great changes have been wrought since first The Roman legions stood Beneath the ancient oaks that formed The Druid's mystic wood. There frown'd above the dank morass, The forest whose long night Of noisome and of tangled shade Forgot the noontide's light. Men crowded round the victim pyre In worship vile as vain; And God's own precious gift of life, Was flung to him again. We were the savages—of whom We now can only hear; The change has been the mighty work Of many a patient year. The progress of our race is marked Wherever we can turn; No more the gloomy woods extend, No more the death-fires burn. The village rises where once spread Th' inhabitable moor; And Sabbath-bells sweep on the wind, The music of the poor. The sun sinks down o'er myriad spires That glisten in the ray, As almost portions of that heaven To which they point the way. There is not a more lovely land On all our lovely earth, Than that, Victoria, which now gives Its blessing on thy birth. Such, youthful Ladye, is the outward seeming Of the fair land whose trust is placed on thee; Alas! too much is as the ivy gleaming Round the worn branches of some ancient tree. Farewell unto thy childhood, and for ever; Youth's careless hours dwell not around a throne; The hallowed purpose, and the high endeavour, The onward-looking thought must be thine own. An hour of moral contest is before thee, Not the old combat of the shield and spear, But to the azure heaven arching o'er thee, Rises a nobler hope—a loftier fear. “Rises a nobler hope—a loftier fear.”—Human perfection is still a beautiful and unrealized dream; it has its encouragement in human progress. A higher and more generous purpose is now the stimulus to all efforts of improvement: our views are more enlightened, because more general; the many have taken the place of the few. In the earlier ages, science kept as secrets those discoveries, which now its chief object is to promulgate. Trade was fettered by monopolies, which it is the first step of commerce to shake off. Laws were rather privilege than protection, not what to-day admits them to be, the sacred barriers of universal right. Knowledge was solitary distinction, or secluded enjoyment; not, as now, to be gained by all, and to be used for all. It is to intellectual intercourse that we owe our advancement; intellect is the pioneer to improvement. We have still to hope, and to aspire. It is only by looking onwards that we can perceive the goal; it is only by looking upwards that we can see heaven. Low in decay lies many an aged error, From dust of mouldering falsehood springeth Truth; The past is to the present as a mirror; And Hope, to mankind has eternal youth. Vast is the charge entrusted by high Heaven, Heavy the weight upon that delicate hand; Into thy keeping is the balance given, Wherein is weighed the future of our land. Around thee is much misery: want and sorrow Lurk in the hidden places of our earth; To-day how many tremble at to-morrow, Life has to them been bitter from its birth. Mark those pale children “Mark those pale children.”—If there be one condition in our land that demands assistance and sympathy, it is that of children of the poor.— It is for childhood's hour to be Life's fairy well, and bring To life's worn, weary memory The freshness of its spring. But here the order is reversed, And infancy, like age, Knows of existence but its worst, One dull and darkened page. Written with tears, and stamped with toil, Crushed from the earliest hour, Weeds darkening on the bitter soil, That never knew a flower. Alas! to think upon a child That has no childish days, No careless play, no frolics wild, No words of prayer and praise. Man from the cradle, 'tis too soon To earn their daily bread, And heap the heat and toil Upon an infant's head. To labour ere their strength be come, Or starve—such is the doom That makes of many an English home, One long and living tomb. This is no overcharged picture: many a cottage in our villages—many a court in our cities, attest its truth. Example is the influence of a Sovereign; and Royal sympathy will avail to draw that attention which is the harbinger of remedy. In the education of the poor lies the true preservative against the worst ills of want. The first steps towards this object must be taken by the rich; this brings the two classes together, and for their mutual benefit. Indifference is startled out of selfish indulgence—and ignorance awakened into hope. Instruction forms the habit, and lays open the resource—while the schemes that originated in pity will be matured by thought; for to effect the beneficial result, it is the mind that must direct the heart.—cold and wan while basking O'er embers mocking with their feeble glow; The elder silent—but the youngest asking For food the mother has not to bestow. These are life's common scenes—thy regal dower Were but a drop flung in a boundless sea; But thou mayest lead the way—the pomp of power Will make the careless many follow thee. From glowing Ind to Huron's waters spreading Extends the empire that our sword hath won, There have our sails been peace and knowledge shedding, Upon thy sceptre never sets the sun. A nobler triumph still awaits thy winning, “The mind's ethereal war” is in its birth; The Cross of Christ is on its way, beginning Its glorious triumph o'er the darkened earth. God's blessing be upon thee, Royal Maiden! And be thy throne heaven's altar here below, With sweet thanksgivings, and with honours laden, Of moral victories o'er want and woe. Glorious and happy be thy coming hours, Young Daughter of old England's Royal line! As in an angel's pathway spring up flowers, So may a Nation's blessing spring in thine. THE END.</field>
