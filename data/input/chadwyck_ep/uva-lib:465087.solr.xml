      <field name="fulltext">I THE WORKS IN ILLUMINATED PRINTING THE BOOK of THEL The Author &amp; Printer Will? Blake, 1789. PLATE i THEL'S Motto, Does the Eagle know what is in the pit? Or wilt thou go ask the Mole: Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod? Or Love in a golden bowl? PLATE 1 I The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks, All but the youngest. she in paleness sought the secret air. To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day: Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard: And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew. O life of this our spring! why fades the lotus of the water? Why fade these children of the spring? born but to smile &amp; fall. Ah! Thel is like a watry bow, and like a parting cloud, Like a reflection in a glass. like shadows in the water. Like dreams of infants. like a smile upon an infants face, Like the doves voice, like transient day, like music in the air; Ah! gentle may I lay me down, and gentle rest my head. And gentle sleep the sleep of death. and gentle hear the voice Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time. The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass Answer'd the lovely maid and said; I am a watry weed, And I am very small, and love to dwell in lowly vales; So weak, the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head Yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all. Walks in the valley. and each morn over me spreads his hand Saying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou new-born lilly flower, Thou gentle maid of silent valleys. and of modest brooks; For thou shalt be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna: Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs To flourish in eternal vales: then why should Thel complain, PLATE 2 Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh. She ceasd &amp; smild in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine. Thel answerd. O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley. Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o'ertired. Thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells thy milky garments, He crops thy flowers. while thou sittest smiling in his face, Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints. Thy wine doth purify the golden honey, thy perfume, Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs Revives the milked cow, &amp; tames the fire-breathing steed. But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun: I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place. Queen of the vales the Lilly answerd, ask the tender cloud, And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky, And why it scatters its bright beauty thro' the humid air. Descend O little cloud &amp; hover before the eyes of Thel. The Cloud descended, and the Lilly bowd her modest head: And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass. PLATE 3 II O little Cloud the virgin said, I charge thee tell to me, Why thou complainest not when in one hour thou fade away: Then we shall seek thee but not find; ah Thel is like to Thee. I pass away. yet I complain, and no one hears my voice. The Cloud then shew'd his golden head &amp; his bright form emerg'd, Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel. O virgin know'st thou not. our steeds drink of the golden springs Where Luvah doth renew his horses: look'st thou on my youth, And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more. Nothing remains; O maid I tell thee, when I pass away, It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy: Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers; And court the fair eyed dew. to take me to her shining tent; The weeping virgin, trembling kneels before the risen sun, Till we arise link'd in a golden band, and never part; But walk united, bearing food to all our tender flowers Dost thou O little Cloud? I fear that I am not like thee; For I walk through the vales of Har. and smell the sweetest flowers; But I feed not the little flowers: I hear the warbling birds, But I feed not the warbling birds. they fly and seek their food; But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away, And all shall say, without a use this shining woman liv'd, Or did she only live. to be at death the food of worms. The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answer'd thus. Then if thou art the food of worms. O virgin of the skies, How great thy use. how great thy blessing; every thing that lives, Lives not alone, nor for itself: fear not and I will call The weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice. Come forth worm of the silent valley, to thy pensive queen. The helpless worm arose, and sat upon the Lillys leaf, And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale. PLATE 4 III. Then Thel astonish'd view'd the Worm upon its dewy bed. Art thou a Worm? image of weakness. art thou but a Worm? I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf: Ah weep not little voice, thou can'st not speak. but thou can'st weep; Is this a Worm? I see thee lay helpless &amp; naked: weeping, And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles. The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice, &amp; raisd her pitying head; She bow'd over the weeping infant, and her life exhal'd In milky fondness, then on Thel she fix'd her humble eyes. O beauty of the vales of Har. we live not for ourselves, Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed; My bosom of itself is cold. and of itself is dark, PLATE 5 But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head. And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast, And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee. And I have given thee a crown that none can take away But how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know, I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love. The daughter of beauty wip'd her pitying tears with her white veil, And said. Alas! I knew not this, and therefore did I weep: That God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot That wilful, bruis'd its helpless form: but that he cherish'd it With milk and oil. I never knew; and therefore did I weep, And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away, And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot. Queen of the vales, the matron Clay answerd; I heard thy sighs. And all thy moans flew o'er my roof. but I have call'd them down: Wilt thou O Queen enter my house. 'tis given thee to enter, And to return; fear nothing. enter with thy virgin feet. PLATE 6 IV. The eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar: Thel enter'd in &amp; saw the secrets of the land unknown; She saw the couches of the dead, &amp; where the fibrous roots Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists: A land of sorrows &amp; of tears where never smile was seen. She wanderd in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning Dolours &amp; lamentations: waiting oft beside a dewy grave She stood in silence. listning to the voices of the ground, Till to her own grave plot she came, &amp; there she sat down. And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit. Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction? Or the glistning Eye to the poison of a smile! Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn, Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie? Or an Eye of gifts &amp; graces, show'ring fruits &amp; coined gold! Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind? Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in? Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling &amp; affright Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy! Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire? The Virgin started from her seat, &amp; with a shriek. Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har The End SONGS Of INNOCENCE and Of EXPERIENCE Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul SONGS of Innocence 1789 The Author &amp; Printer W Blake Introduction Piping down the valleys wild Piping songs of pleasant glee On a cloud I saw a child. And he laughing said to me. Pipe a song about a Lamb; So I piped with merry chear, Piper pipe that song again— So I piped, he wept to hear. Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe Sing thy songs of happy chear, So I sung the same again While he wept with joy to hear Piper sit thee down and write In a book that all may read— So he vanish'd from my sight. And I pluck'd a hollow reed. And I made a rural pen, And I stain'd the water clear, And I wrote my happy songs Every child may joy to hear The Shepherd. How sweet is the Shepherds sweet lot, From the morn to the evening he strays: He shall follow his sheep all the day And his tongue shall be filled with praise. For he hears the lambs innocent call, And he hears the ewes tender reply, He is watchful while they are in peace, For they know when their Shepherd is nigh. The Ecchoing Green The Sun does arise, And make happy the skies. The merry bells ring To welcome the Spring. The sky-lark and thrush, The birds of the bush, Sing louder around, To the bells chearful sound. While our sports shall be seen On the Ecchoing Green. Old John with white hair Does laugh away care, Sitting under the oak, Among the old folk, They laugh at our play, And soon they all say. Such such were the joys. When we all girls &amp; boys, In our youth-time were seen, On the Ecchoing Green. Till the little ones weary No more can be merry The sun does descend, And our sports have an end: Round the laps of their mothers, Many sisters and brothers, Like birds in their nest, Are ready for rest; And sport no more seen, On the darkening Green. The Lamb Little Lamb who made thee Dost thou know who made thee Gave thee life &amp; bid thee feed. By the stream &amp; o'er the mead; Gave thee clothing of delight, Softest clothing wooly bright; Gave thee such a tender voice, Making all the vales rejoice! Little Lamb who made thee Dost thou know who made thee Little Lamb I'll tell thee, Little Lamb I'll tell thee! He is called by thy name, For he calls himself a Lamb: He is meek &amp; he is mild, He became a little child: I a child &amp; thou a lamb, We are called by his name. Little Lamb God bless thee. Little Lamb God bless thee. The Little Black Boy. My mother bore me in the southern wild, And I am black, but O! my soul is white; White as an angel is the English child: But I am black as if bereav'd of light. My mother taught me underneath a tree And sitting down before the heat of day, She took me on her lap and kissed me, And pointing to the east began to say. Look on the rising sun: there God does live And gives his light, and gives his heat away. And flowers and trees and beasts and men recieve Comfort in morning joy in the noon day. And we are put on earth a little space, That we may learn to bear the beams of love, And these black bodies and this sun-burnt face Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove. For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice. Saying: come out from the grove my love &amp; care, And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice. Thus did my mother say and kissed me, And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black and he from white cloud free, And round the tent of God like lambs we joy: Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear, To lean in joy upon our fathers knee. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair, And be like him and he will then love me. The Blossom. Merry Merry Sparrow Under leaves so green A happy Blossom Sees you swift as arrow Seek your cradle narrow Near my Bosom. Pretty Pretty Robin Under leaves so green A happy Blossom Hears you sobbing sobbing Pretty Pretty Robin Near my Bosom. The Chimney Sweeper When my mother died I was very young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue, Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep. So your chimneys I sweep &amp; in soot I sleep. Theres little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head That curl'd like a lambs back, was shav'd, so I said. Hush Tom never mind it, for when your head's bare, You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair. And so he was quiet, &amp; that very night, As Tom was a sleeping he had such a sight, That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe Ned &amp; Jack Were all of them lock'd up in coffins of black And by came an Angel who had a bright key, And he open'd the coffins &amp; set them all free. Then down a green plain leaping laughing they run And wash in a river and shine in the Sun. Then naked &amp; white, all their bags left behind, They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind. And the Angel told Tom if he'd be a good boy, He'd have God for his father &amp; never want joy. And so Tom awoke and we rose in the dark And got with our bags &amp; our brushes to work. Tho' the morning was cold, Tom was happy &amp; warm, So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm. The Little Boy lost Father, father, where are you going O do not walk so fast. Speak father, speak to your little boy Or else I shall be lost, The night was dark no father was there The child was wet with dew. The mire was deep, &amp; the child did weep And away the vapour flew. The Little Boy Found The little boy lost in the lonely fen, Led by the wand'ring light, Began to cry, but God ever nigh, Appeard like his father in white. He kissed the child &amp; by the hand led And to his mother brought, Who in sorrow pale, thro' the lonely dale Her little boy weeping sought. Laughing Song When the green woods laugh, with the voice of joy And the dimpling stream runs laughing by, When the air does laugh with our merry wit, And the green hill laughs with the noise of it. When the meadows laugh with lively green And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene, When Mary and Susan and Emily, With their sweet round mouths sing Ha, Ha, He. When the painted birds laugh in the shade Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread Come live &amp; be merry and join with me, To sing the sweet chorus of Ha, Ha, He. A CRADLE SONG Sweet dreams form a shade, O'er my lovely infants head. Sweet dreams of pleasant streams, By happy silent moony beams. Sweet sleep with soft down, Weave thy brows an infant crown. Sweet sleep Angel mild, Hover o'er my happy child. Sweet smiles in the night, Hover over my delight. Sweet smiles Mothers smiles All the livelong night beguiles. Sweet moans, dovelike sighs, Chase not slumber from thy eyes. Sweet moans, sweeter smiles, All the dovelike moans beguiles. Sleep sleep happy child. All creation slept and smil'd. Sleep sleep, happy sleep, While o'er thee thy mother weep. Sweet babe in thy face, Holy image I can trace. Sweet babe once like thee, Thy maker lay and wept for me Wept for me for thee for all, When he was an infant small. Thou his image ever see, Heavenly face that smiles on thee. Smiles on thee on me on all, Who became an infant small, Infant smiles are his own smiles. Heaven &amp; earth to peace beguiles. The Divine Image. To Mercy Pity Peace and Love, All pray in their distress: And to these virtues of delight Return their thankfulness. For Mercy Pity Peace and Love, Is God our father dear: And Mercy Pity Peace and Love, Is Man his child and care. For Mercy has a human heart Pity, a human face: And Love, the human form divine, And Peace, the human dress. Then every man of every clime, That prays in his distress, Prays to the human form divine Love Mercy Pity Peace. And all must love the human form, In heathen, turk or jew. Where Mercy, Love &amp; Pity dwell There God is dwelling too. HOLY THURSDAY Twas on a Holy Thursday their innocent faces clean The children walking two &amp; two in red &amp; blue &amp; green Grey headed beadles walkd before with wands as white as snow Till into the high dome of Pauls they like Thames waters flow O what a multitude they seemd these flowers of London town Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own The hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs Thousands of little boys &amp; girls raising their innocent hands Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among Beneath them sit the aged men wise guardians of the poor Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door Night. The sun descending in the west The evening star does shine. The birds are silent in their nest, And I must seek for mine, The moon like a flower, In heavens high bower; With silent delight, Sits and smiles on the night. Farewell green fields and happy groves, Where flocks have took delight; Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves The feet of angels bright; Unseen they pour blessing, And joy without ceasing, On each bud and blossom, And each sleeping bosom. They look in every thoughtless nest, Where birds are coverd warm; They visit caves of every beast, To keep them all from harm; If they see any weeping, That should have been sleeping They pour sleep on their head And sit down by their bed. When wolves and tygers howl for prey They pitying stand and weep; Seeking to drive their thirst away, And keep them from the sheep. But if they rush dreadful; The angels most heedful, Recieve each mild spirit, New worlds to inherit. And there the lions ruddy eyes, Shall flow with tears of gold: And pitying the tender cries, And walking round the fold: Saying: wrath by his meekness And by his health, sickness, Is driven away, From our immortal day. And now beside thee bleating lamb, I can lie down and sleep; Or think on him who bore thy name, Graze after thee and weep. For wash'd in lifes river, My bright mane for ever, Shall shine like the gold, As I guard o'er the fold. Spring Sound the Flute! Now it's mute. Birds delight Day and Night. Nightingale In the dale Lark in Sky Merrily Merrily Merrily to welcome in the Year Little Boy Full of joy. Little Girl Sweet and small, Cock does crow So do you. Merry voice Infant noise Merrily Merrily to welcome in the Year Little Lamb Here I am, Come and lick My white neck. Let me pull Your soft Wool. Let me kiss Your soft face. Merrily Merrily we welcome in the Year Nurse's Song When the voices of children are heard on the green And laughing is heard on the hill, My heart is at rest within my breast And every thing else is still Then come home my children, the sun is gone down And the dews of night arise Come come leave off play, and let us away Till the morning appears in the skies No no let us play, for it is yet day And we cannot go to sleep Besides in the sky, the little birds fly And the hills are all coverd with sheep Well well go &amp; play till the light fades away And then go home to bed The little ones leaped &amp; shouted &amp; laugh'd And all the hills ecchoed Infant Joy I have no name I am but two days old.— What shall I call thee? I happy am Joy is my name,— Sweet joy befall thee! Pretty joy! Sweet joy but two days old. Sweet joy I call thee: Thou dost smile. I sing the while Sweet joy befall thee. A Dream Once a dream did weave a shade, O'er my Angel-guarded bed, That an Emmet lost it's way Where on grass methought I lay. Troubled wilderd and folorn Dark benighted travel-worn, Over many a tangled spray All heart-broke I heard her say. O my children! do they cry Do they hear their father sigh. Now they look abroad to see, Now return and weep for me. Pitying I drop'd a tear: But I saw a glow-worm near: Who replied. What wailing wight Calls the watchman of the night. I am set to light the ground, While the beetle goes his round: Follow now the beetles hum, Little wanderer hie thee home. On Anothers Sorrow Can I see anothers woe, And not be in sorrow too. Can I see anothers grief, And not seek for kind relief. Can I see a falling tear, And not feel my sorrows share, Can a father see his child, Weep, nor be with sorrow fill'd. Can a mother sit and hear, An infant groan an infant fear— No no never can it be. Never never can it be. And can he who smiles on all Hear the wren with sorrows small, Hear the small birds grief &amp; care Hear the woes that infants bear— And not sit beside the nest Pouring pity in their breast, And not sit the cradle near Weeping tear on infants tear. And not sit both night &amp; day, Wiping all our tears away. O! no never can it be. Never never can it be. He doth give his joy to all. He becomes an infant small. He becomes a man of woe He doth feel the sorrow too. Think not, thou canst sigh a sigh, And thy maker is not by. Think not, thou canst weep a tear, And thy maker is not near. O! he gives to us his joy, That our grief he may destroy Till our grief is fled &amp; gone He doth sit by us and moan SONGS of Experience 1794 The Author &amp; Printer W Blake Introduction. Hear the voice of the Bard! Who Present, Past, &amp; Future sees Whose ears have heard, The Holy Word, That walk'd among the ancient trees. Calling the lapsed Soul And weeping in the evening dew; That might controll, The starry pole; And fallen fallen light renew! O Earth O Earth return! Arise from out the dewy grass; Night is worn, And the morn Rises from the slumberous mass. Turn away no more: Why wilt thou turn away The starry floor The watry shore Is giv'n thee till the break of day. EARTH'S Answer Earth rais'd up her head, From the darkness dread &amp; drear. Her light fled: Stony dread! And her locks cover'd with grey despair. Prison'd on watry shore Starry Jealousy does keep my den Cold and hoar Weeping o'er I hear the Father of the ancient men Selfish father of men Cruel jealous selfish fear Can delight Chain'd in night The virgins of youth and morning bear. Does spring hide its joy When buds and blossoms grow? Does the sower? Sow by night? Or the plowman in darkness plow? Break this heavy chain, That does freeze my bones around Selfish! vain, Eternal bane! That free Love with bondage bound. The CLOD &amp; the PEBBLE Love seeketh not Itself to please, Nor for itself hath any care; But for another gives its ease, And builds a Heaven in Hells despair. So sang a little Clod of Clay, Trodden with the cattles feet: But a Pebble of the brook, Warbled out these metres meet. Love seeketh only Self to please, To bind another to its delight; Joys in anothers loss of ease, And builds a Hell in Heavens despite. HOLY THURSDAY Is this a holy thing to see, In a rich and fruitful land, Babes reducd to misery, Fed with cold and usurous hand? Is that trembling cry a song? Can it be a song of joy? And so many children poor? It is a land of poverty! And their sun does never shine. And their fields are bleak &amp; bare. And their ways are fill'd with thorns. It is eternal winter there. For where-e'er the sun does shine, And where-e'er the rain does fall: Babe can never hunger there, Nor poverty the mind appall. The Little Girl Lost In futurity I prophetic see, That the earth from sleep, (Grave the sentence deep) Shall arise and seek For her maker meek: And the desart wild Become a garden mild. In the southern clime, Where the summers prime, Never fades away; Lovely Lyca lay. Seven summers old Lovely Lyca told, She had wanderd long, Hearing wild birds song. Sweet sleep come to me Underneath this tree; Do father, mother weep.— “Where can Lyca sleep”. Lost in desart wild Is your little child. How can Lyca sleep, If her mother weep. If her heart does ake, Then let Lyca wake; If my mother sleep, Lyca shall not weep. Frowning frowning night, O'er this desart bright, Let thy moon arise, While I close my eyes. Sleeping Lyca lay; While the beasts of prey, Come from caverns deep, View'd the maid asleep The kingly lion stood And the virgin view'd, Then he gambold round O'er the hallowd ground: Leopards, tygers play, Round her as she lay; While the lion old, Bow'd his mane of gold. And her bosom lick, And upon her neck, From his eyes of flame, Ruby tears there came; While the lioness, Loos'd her slender dress, And naked they convey'd To caves the sleeping maid. The Little Girl Found All the night in woe Lyca's parents go: Over vallies deep, While the desarts weep. Tired and woe-begone, Hoarse with making moan: Arm in arm seven days, They trac'd the desart ways. Seven nights they sleep, Among shadows deep: And dream they see their child Starv'd in desart wild. Pale thro pathless ways The fancied image strays, Famish'd, weeping, weak With hollow piteous shriek Rising from unrest, The trembling woman prest, With feet of weary woe; She could no further go. In his arms he bore, Her arm'd with sorrow sore; Till before their way, A couching lion lay. Turning back was vain, Soon his heavy mane, Bore them to the ground; Then he stalk'd around, Smelling to his prey. But their fears allay, When he licks their hands; And silent by them stands. They look upon his eyes Fill'd with deep surprise: And wondering behold, A spirit arm'd in gold. On his head a crown On his shoulders down, Flow'd his golden hair. Gone was all their care. Follow me he said, Weep not for the maid; In my palace deep, Lyca lies asleep. Then they followed, Where the vision led: And saw their sleeping child, Among tygers wild. To this day they dwell In a lonely dell Nor fear the wolvish howl, Nor the lions growl. THE Chimney Sweeper A little black thing among the snow: Crying weep, weep, in notes of woe! Where are thy father &amp; mother? say? They are both gone up to the church to pray. Because I was happy upon the heath, And smil'd among the winters snow: They clothed me in the clothes of death, And taught me to sing the notes of woe. And because I am happy, &amp; dance &amp; sing, They think they have done me no injury: And are gone to praise God &amp; his Priest &amp; King Who make up a heaven of our misery. NURSES Song When the voices of children, are heard on the green And whisprings are in the dale: The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind, My face turns green and pale. Then come home my children, the sun is gone down And the dews of night arise Your spring &amp; your day, are wasted in play And your winter and night in disguise. The SICK ROSE O Rose thou art sick. The invisible worm, That flies in the night In the howling storm: Has found out thy bed Of crimson joy: And his dark secret love Does thy life destroy. THE FLY. Little Fly Thy summers play, My thoughtless hand Has brush'd away. Am not I A fly like thee? Or art not thou A man like me? For I dance And drink &amp; sing; Till some blind hand Shall brush my wing. If thought is life And strength &amp; breath; And the want Of thought is death; Then am I A happy fly, If I live, Or if I die. The Angel I Dreamt a Dream! what can it mean? And that I was a maiden Queen: Guarded by an Angel mild; Witless woe, was ne'er beguil'd! And I wept both night and day And he wip'd my tears away And I wept both day and night And hid from him my hearts delight So he took his wings and fled: Then the morn blush'd rosy red: I dried my tears &amp; armd my fears, With ten thousand shields and spears. Soon my Angel came again: I was arm'd, he came in vain: For the time of youth was fled And grey hairs were on my head. The Tyger Tyger Tyger, burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immortal hand or eye, Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes! On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand, dare sieze the fire? And what shoulder, &amp; what art, Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand? &amp; what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain, In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp, Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears And water'd heaven with their tears: Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger, Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night: What immortal hand or eye, Dare frame thy fearful symmetry? My Pretty ROSE TREE A flower was offerd to me; Such a flower as May never bore. But I said I've a Pretty Rose-tree, And I passed the sweet flower o'er. Then I went to my Pretty Rose-tree; To tend her by day and by night. But my Rose turnd away with jealousy: And her thorns were my only delight. AH! SUN-FLOWER Ah Sun-flower! weary of time, Who countest the steps of the Sun: Seeking after that sweet golden clime Where the travellers journey is done. Where the Youth pined away with desire, And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow: Arise from their graves and aspire, Where my Sun-flower wishes to go. THE LILLY The modest Rose puts forth a thorn: The humble Sheep, a threatning horn: While the Lilly white, shall in Love delight, Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright The GARDEN of LOVE I went to the Garden of Love, And saw what I never had seen: A Chapel was built in the midst, Where I used to play on the green. And the gates of this Chapel were shut, And Thou shalt not. writ over the door; So I turn'd to the Garden of Love, That so many sweet flowers bore, And I saw it was filled with graves, And tomb-stones where flowers should be: And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds, And binding with briars, my joys &amp; desires. The Little Vagabond Dear Mother, dear Mother, the Church is cold. But the Ale-house is healthy &amp; pleasant &amp; warm; Besides I can tell where I am use'd well, Such usage in heaven will never do well. But if at the Church they would give us some Ale. And a pleasant fire, our souls to regale; We'd sing and we'd pray, all the live-long day; Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray, Then the Parson might preach &amp; drink &amp; sing. And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring: And modest dame Lurch, who is always at Church, Wou'ld not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch. And God like a father rejoicing to see, His children as pleasant and happy as he: Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the Barrel But kiss him &amp; give him both drink and apparel. LONDON I wander thro' each charter'd street, Near where the charter'd Thames does flow. And mark in every face I meet Marks of weakness, marks of woe. In every cry of every Man, In every Infants cry of fear, In every voice: in every ban, The mind-forg'd manacles I hear How the Chimney-sweepers cry Every blackning Church appalls, And the hapless Soldiers sigh, Runs in blood down Palace walls But most thro' midnight streets I hear How the youthful Harlots curse Blasts the new-born Infants tear And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse The Human Abstract. Pity would be no more, If we did not make somebody Poor: And Mercy no more could be, If all were as happy as we; And mutual fear brings peace; Till the selfish loves increase. Then Cruelty knits a snare, And spreads his baits with care. He sits down with holy fears, And waters the ground with tears: Then Humility takes its root Underneath his foot. Soon spreads the dismal shade Of Mystery over his head; And the Catterpiller and Fly, Feed on the Mystery. And it bears the fruit of Deceit, Ruddy and sweet to eat; And the Raven his nest has made In its thickest shade. The Gods of the earth and sea, Sought thro' Nature to find this Tree But their search was all in vain: There grows one in the Human Brain INFANT SORROW My mother groand! my father wept. Into the dangerous world I leapt: Helpless, naked, piping loud; Like a fiend hid in a cloud. Struggling in my fathers hands: Striving against my swadling bands: Bound and weary I thought best To sulk upon my mothers breast. A POISON TREE. I was angry with my friend; I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow. And I waterd it in fears, Night &amp; morning with my tears: And I sunned it with smiles, And with soft deceitful wiles. And it grew both day and night. Till it bore an apple bright. And my foe beheld it shine. And he knew that it was mine. And into my garden stole, When the night had veild the pole; In the morning glad I see; My foe outstretchd beneath the tree. A Little BOY Lost Nought loves another as itself Nor venerates another so. Nor is it possible to Thought A greater than itself to know: And Father, how can I love you, Or any of my brothers more? I love you like the little bird That picks up crumbs around the door. The Priest sat by and heard the child. In trembling zeal he siez'd his hair: He led him by his little coat: And all admir'd the Priestly care. And standing on the altar high, Lo what a fiend is here! said he: One who sets reason up for judge Of our most holy Mystery. The weeping child could not be heard. The weeping parents wept in vain: They strip'd him to his little shirt. And bound him in an iron chain. And burn'd him in a holy place, Where many had been burn'd before: The weeping parents wept in vain. Are such things done on Albions shore. A Little GIRL Lost Children of the future Age, Reading this indignant page: Know that in a former time, Love! sweet Love! was thought a crime. In the Age of Gold, Free from winters cold: Youth and maiden bright, To the holy light, Naked in the sunny beams delight. Once a youthful pair Fill'd with softest care: Met in garden bright, Where the holy light, Had just removd the curtains of the night. There in rising day, On the grass they play: Parents were afar: Strangers came not near: And the maiden soon forgot her fear. Tired with kisses sweet They agree to meet, When the silent sleep Waves o'er heavens deep; And the weary tired wanderers weep. To her father white Came the maiden bright: But his loving look, Like the holy book, All her tender limbs with terror shook. Ona! pale and weak! To thy father speak: O the trembling fear! O the dismal care! That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair To Tirzah Whate'er is Born of Mortal Birth, Must be consumed with the Earth To rise from Generation free; Then what have I to do with thee? The Sexes sprung from Shame &amp; Pride Blow'd in the morn: in evening died But Mercy changd Death into Sleep; The Sexes rose to work &amp; weep. Thou Mother of my Mortal part With cruelty didst mould my Heart, And with false self-decieving tears, Didst bind my Nostrils Eyes &amp; Ears. Didst close my Tongue in senseless clay And me to Mortal Life betray: The Death of Jesus set me free, Then what have I to do with thee? The School Boy I love to rise in a summer morn, When the birds sing on every tree; The distant huntsman winds his horn, And the sky-lark sings with me. O! what sweet company. But to go to school in a summer morn O! it drives all joy away; Under a cruel eye outworn, The little ones spend the day, In sighing and dismay. Ah! then at times I drooping sit, And spend many an anxious hour. Nor in my book can I take delight, Nor sit in learnings bower, Worn thro' with the dreary shower How can the bird that is born for joy, Sit in a cage and sing. How can a child when fears annoy, But droop his tender wing, And forget his youthful spring. O! father &amp; mother, if buds are nip'd, And blossoms blown away, And if the tender plants are strip'd Of their joy in the springing day, By sorrow and cares dismay, How shall the summer arise in joy Or the summer fruits appear Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy Or bless the mellowing year, When the blasts of winter appear. The Voice of the Ancient Bard. Youth of delight come hither: And see the opening morn, Image of truth new born Doubt is fled &amp; clouds of reason Dark disputes &amp; artful teazing. Folly is an endless maze, Tangled roots perplex her ways, How many have fallen there! They stumble all night over bones of the dead; And feel they know not what but care; And wish to lead others when they should be led. A DIVINE IMAGE [A rejected Song of Experience] Cruelty has a Human Heart And Jealousy a Human Face Terror, the Human Form Divine And Secrecy, the Human Dress The Human Dress, is forged Iron The Human Form, a fiery Forge. The Human Face, a Furnace seal'd The Human Heart, its hungry Gorge. THE MARRIAGE of HEAVEN and HELL PLATE 2 The Argument. Rintrah roars &amp; shakes his fires in the burdend air; Hungry clouds swag on the deep Once meek, and in a perilous path, The just man kept his course along The vale of death. Roses are planted where thorns grow. And on the barren heath Sing the honey bees. Then the perilous path was planted: And a river, and a spring On every cliff and tomb; And on the bleached bones Red clay brought forth. Till the villain left the paths of ease, To walk in perilous paths, and drive The just man into barren climes. Now the sneaking serpent walks In mild humility. And the just man rages in the wilds Where lions roam. Rintrah roars &amp; shakes his fires in the burdend air; Hungry clouds swag on the deep. A Memorable Fancy. How do you know but ev'ry Bird that cuts the airy way, Is an immense world of delight, clos'd by your senses five? Proverbs of Hell. In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy. Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead. The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom. Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity. He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence. The cut worm forgives the plow. Dip him in the river who loves water. A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees. He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star. Eternity is in love with the productions of time. The busy bee has no time for sorrow. The hours of folly are measur'd by the clock, but of wisdom: no clock can measure. All wholsom food is caught without a net or a trap. Bring out number weight &amp; measure in a year of dearth. No bird soars too high. if he soars with his own wings. A dead body. revenges not injuries. The most sublime act is to set another before you. If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise Folly is the cloke of knavery. Shame is Prides cloke. PLATE 8 Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion. The pride of the peacock is the glory of God. The lust of the goat is the bounty of God. The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God. The nakedness of woman is the work of God. Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps. The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword. are portions of eternity too great for the eye of man. The fox condemns the trap, not himself. Joys impregnate. Sorrows bring forth. Let man wear the fell of the lion. woman the fleece of the sheep. The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship. The selfish smiling fool. &amp; the sullen frowning fool. shall be both thought wise. that they may be a rod. What is now proved was once, only imagin'd. The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbet; watch the roots, the lion, the tyger, the horse, the elephant, watch the fruits. The cistern contains: the fountain overflows One thought. fills immensity. Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you. Every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth. The eagle never lost so much time. as when he submitted to learn of the crow. PLATE 9 The fox provides for himself. but God provides for the lion. Think in the morning, Act in the noon, Eat in the evening, Sleep in the night. He who has sufferd you to impose on him knows you. As the plow follows words, so God rewards prayers. The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction Expect poison from the standing water. You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough. Listen to the fools reproach! it is a kingly title! The eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard of earth. The weak in courage is strong in cunning. The apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow, nor the lion. the horse, how he shall take his prey. The thankful reciever bears a plentiful harvest. If others had not been foolish, we should be so. The soul of sweet delight, can never be defil'd, When thou seest an Eagle, thou seest a portion of Genius. lift up thy head! As the catterpiller chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. To create a little flower is the labour of ages. Damn. braces: Bless relaxes. The best wine is the oldest. the best water the newest. Prayers plow not! Praises reap not! Joys laugh not! Sorrows weep not! PLATE 10 The head Sublime, the heart Pathos, the genitals Beauty, the hands &amp; feet Proportion. As the air to a bird or the sea to a fish, so is contempt to the contemptible. The crow wish'd every thing was black, the owl, that every thing was white. Exuberance is Beauty. If the lion was advise'd by the fox. he would be cunning. Improve[me]nt makes strait roads, but the crooked roads without Improvement, are roads of Genius. Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires Where man is not nature is barren. Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ'd. Enough! or Too much VISIONS of the Daughters of Albion The Eye sees more than the Heart knows. Printed by Will:? Blake: 1793. PLATE iii The Argument I loved Theotormon And I was not ashamed I trembled in my virgin fears And I hid in Leutha's vale! I plucked Leutha's flower, And I rose up from the vale; But the terrible thunders tore My virgin mantle in twain. PLATE 1 Visions Enslav'd, the Daughters of Albion weep: a trembling lamentation Upon their mountains; in their valleys. sighs toward America. For the soft soul of America, Oothoon wanderd in woe, Along the vales of Leutha seeking flowers to comfort her; And thus she spoke to the bright Marygold of Leutha's vale Art thou a flower! art thou a nymph! I see thee now a flower; Now a nymph! I dare not pluck thee from thy dewy bed? The Golden nymph replied; pluck thou my flower Oothoon the mild Another flower shall spring, because the soul of sweet delight Can never pass away. she ceas'd &amp; closd her golden shrine. Then Oothoon pluck'd the flower saying, I pluck thee from thy bed Sweet flower. and put thee here to glow between my breasts And thus I turn my face to where my whole soul seeks. Over the waves she went in wing'd exulting swift delight; And over Theotormons reign, took her impetuous course. Bromion rent her with his thunders. on his stormy bed Lay the faint maid, and soon her woes appalld his thunders hoarse Bromion spoke. behold this harlot here on Bromions bed, And let the jealous dolphins sport around the lovely maid; Thy soft American plains are mine, and mine thy north &amp; south: Stampt with my signet are the swarthy children of the sun: They are obedient, they resist not, they obey the scourge: Their daughters worship terrors and obey the violent: PLATE 2 Now thou maist marry Bromions harlot, and protect the child Of Bromions rage, that Oothoon shall put forth in nine moons time Then storms rent Theotormons limbs; he rolld his waves around. And folded his black jealous waters round the adulterate pair Bound back to back in Bromions caves terror &amp; meekness dwell At entrance Theotormon sits wearing the threshold hard With secret tears; beneath him sound like waves on a desart shore The voice of slaves beneath the sun, and children bought with money. That shiver in religious caves beneath the burning fires Of lust, that belch incessant from the summits of the earth Oothoon weeps not: she cannot weep! her tears are locked up; But she can howl incessant writhing her soft snowy limbs. And calling Theotormons Eagles to prey upon her flesh. I call with holy voice! kings of the sounding air, Rend away this defiled bosom that I may reflect. The image of Theotormon on my pure transparent breast. The Eagles at her call descend &amp; rend their bleeding prey; Theotormon severely smiles. her soul reflects the smile; As the clear spring mudded with feet of beasts grows pure &amp; smiles. The Daughters of Albion hear her woes. &amp; eccho back her sighs. Why does my Theotormon sit weeping upon the threshold; And Oothoon hovers by his side, perswading him in vain: I cry arise O Theotormon for the village dog Barks at the breaking day. the nightingale has done lamenting. The lark does rustle in the ripe corn, and the Eagle returns From nightly prey, and lifts his golden beak to the pure east; Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions to awake The sun that sleeps too long. Arise my Theotormon I am pure. Because the night is gone that clos'd me in its deadly black. They told me that the night &amp; day were all that I could see; They told me that I had five senses to inclose me up. And they inclos'd my infinite brain into a narrow circle. And sunk my heart into the Abyss, a red round globe hot burning Till all from life I was obliterated and erased. Instead of morn arises a bright shadow, like an eye In the eastern cloud: instead of night a sickly charnel house; That Theotormon hears me not! to him the night and morn Are both alike: a night of sighs, a morning of fresh tears; PLATE 3 And none but Bromion can hear my lamentations. With what sense is it that the chicken shuns the ravenous hawk? With what sense does the tame pigeon measure out the expanse? With what sense does the bee form cells? have not the mouse &amp; frog Eyes and ears and sense of touch? yet are their habitations. And their pursuits, as different as their forms and as their joys: Ask the wild ass why he refuses burdens: and the meek camel Why he loves man: is it because of eye ear mouth or skin Or breathing nostrils? No. for these the wolf and tyger have. Ask the blind worm the secrets of the grave, and why her spires Love to curl round the bones of death; and ask the rav'nous snake Where she gets poison: &amp; the wing'd eagle why he loves the sun And then tell me the thoughts of man, that have been hid of old. Silent I hover all the night, and all day could be silent. If Theotormon once would turn his loved eyes upon me; How can I be defild when I reflect thy image pure? Sweetest the fruit that the worm feeds on. &amp; the soul prey'd on by woe The new wash'd lamb ting'd with the village smoke &amp; the bright swan By the red earth of our immortal river: I bathe my wings. And I am white and pure to hover round Theotormons breast. Then Theotormon broke his silence. and he answered. Tell me what is the night or day to one o'erflowd with woe? Tell me what is a thought? &amp; of what substance is it made? Tell me what is a joy? &amp; in what gardens do joys grow? And in what rivers swim the sorrows? and upon what mountains PLATE 4 Wave shadows of discontent? and in what houses dwell the wretched Drunken with woe forgotten. and shut up from cold despair. Tell me where dwell the thoughts forgotten till thou call them forth Tell me where dwell the joys of old! &amp; where the ancient loves? And when will they renew again &amp; the night of oblivion past? That I might traverse times &amp; spaces far remote and bring Comforts into a present sorrow and a night of pain Where goest thou O thought? to what remote land is thy flight? If thou returnest to the present moment of affliction Wilt thou bring comforts on thy wings. and dews and honey and balm; Or poison from the desart wilds, from the eyes of the envier. Then Bromion said: and shook the cavern with his lamentation Thou knowest that the ancient trees seen by thine eyes have fruit; But knowest thou that trees and fruits flourish upon the earth To gratify senses unknown? trees beasts and birds unknown: Unknown, not unpercievd, spread in the infinite microscope, In places yet unvisited by the voyager. and in worlds Over another kind of seas, and in atmospheres unknown: Ah! are there other wars, beside the wars of sword and fire! And are there other sorrows, beside the sorrows of poverty! And are there other joys, beside the joys of riches and ease? And is there not one law for both the lion and the ox? And is there not eternal fire, and eternal chains? To bind the phantoms of existence from eternal life? Then Oothoon waited silent all the day. and all the night, PLATE 5 But when the morn arose, her lamentation renewd, The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, &amp; eccho back her sighs. O Urizen! Creator of men! mistaken Demon of heaven: Thy joys are tears! thy labour vain, to form men to thine image. How can one joy absorb another? are not different joys Holy, eternal, infinite! and each joy is a Love. Does not the great mouth laugh at a gift? &amp; the narrow eyelids mock At the labour that is above payment, and wilt thou take the ape For thy councellor? or the dog, for a schoolmaster to thy children? Does he who contemns poverty, and he who turns with abhorrence From usury: feel the same passion or are they moved alike? How can the giver of gifts experience the delights of the merchant? How the industrious citizen the pains of the husbandman. How different far the fat fed hireling with hollow drum; Who buys whole corn fields into wastes, and sings upon the heath: How different their eye and ear! how different the world to them! With what sense does the parson claim the labour of the farmer? What are his nets &amp; gins &amp; traps. &amp; how does he surround him With cold floods of abstraction, and with forests of solitude, To build him castles and high spires. where kings &amp; priests may dwell. Till she who burns with youth. and knows no fixed lot; is bound In spells of law to one she loaths: and must she drag the chain Of life, in weary lust! must chilling murderous thoughts. obscure The clear heaven of her eternal spring? to bear the wintry rage Of a harsh terror driv'n to madness, bound to hold a rod Over her shrinking shoulders all the day; &amp; all the night To turn the wheel of false desire: and longings that wake her womb To the abhorred birth of cherubs in the human form That live a pestilence &amp; die a meteor &amp; are no more. Till the child dwell with one he hates. and do the deed he loaths And the impure scourge force his seed into its unripe birth E'er yet his eyelids can behold the arrows of the day. Does the whale worship at thy footsteps as the hungry dog? Or does he scent the mountain prey, because his nostrils wide Draw in the ocean? does his eye discern the flying cloud As the ravens eye? or does he measure the expanse like the vulture? Does the still spider view the cliffs where eagles hide their young? Or does the fly rejoice. because the harvest is brought in? Does not the eagle scorn the earth &amp; despise the treasures beneath? But the mole knoweth what is there, &amp; the worm shall tell it thee. Does not the worm erect a pillar in the mouldering church yard? PLATE 6 And a palace of eternity in the jaws of the hungry grave Over his porch these words are written. Take thy bliss O Man! And sweet shall be thy taste &amp; sweet thy infant joys renew! Infancy, fearless, lustful, happy! nestling for delight In laps of pleasure; Innocence! honest, open, seeking The vigorous joys of morning light; open to virgin bliss, Who taught thee modesty, subtil modesty! child of night &amp; sleep When thou awakest. wilt thou dissemble all thy secret joys Or wert thou not, awake when all this mystery was disclos'd! Then com'st thou forth a modest virgin knowing to dissemble With nets found under thy night pillow, to catch virgin joy, And brand it with the name of whore; &amp; sell it in the night, In silence. ev'n without a whisper, and in seeming sleep: Religious dreams and holy vespers, light thy smoky fires: Once were thy fires lighted by the eyes of honest morn And does my Theotormon seek this hypocrite modesty! This knowing, artful, secret, fearful, cautious, trembling hypocrite. Then is Oothoon a whore indeed! and all the virgin joys Of life are harlots: and Theotormon is a sick mans dream And Oothoon is the crafty slave of selfish holiness. But Oothoon is not so, a virgin fill'd with virgin fancies Open to joy and to delight where ever beauty appears If in the morning sun I find it: there my eyes are fix'd PLATE 7 In happy copulation; if in evening mild. wearied with work; Sit on a bank and draw the pleasures of this free born joy. The moment of desire! the moment of desire! The virgin That pines for man; shall awaken her womb to enormous joys In the secret shadows of her chamber; the youth shut up from The lustful joy. shall forget to generate. &amp; create an amorous image In the shadows of his curtains and in the folds of his silent pillow. Are not these the places of religion? the rewards of continence? The self enjoyings of self denial? Why dost thou seek religion? Is it because acts are not lovely, that thou seekest solitude, Where the horrible darkness is impressed with reflections of desire. Father of Jealousy. be thou accursed from the earth! Why hast thou taught my Theotormon this accursed thing? Till beauty fades from off my shoulders darken'd and cast out, A solitary shadow wailing on the margin of non-entity. I cry, Love! Love! Love! happy happy Love! free as the mountain wind! Can that be Love, that drinks another as a sponge drinks water? That clouds with jealousy his nights, with weepings all the day: To spin a web of age around him. grey and hoary! dark! Till his eyes sicken at the fruit that hangs before his sight. Such is self-love that envies all! a creeping skeleton With lamplike eyes watching around the frozen marriage bed. But silken nets and traps of adamant will Oothoon spread, And catch for thee girls of mild silver, or of furious gold; I'll lie beside thee on a bank &amp; view their wanton play In lovely copulation bliss on bliss with Theotormon: Red as the rosy morning, lustful as the first born beam, Oothoon shall view his dear delight, nor e'er with jealous cloud Come in the heaven of generous love; nor selfish blightings bring. Does the sun walk in glorious raiment. on the secret floor PLATE 8 Where the cold miser spreads his gold? or does the bright cloud drop On his stone threshold? does his eye behold the beam that brings Expansion to the eye of pity? or will he bind himself Beside the ox to thy hard furrow? does not that mild beam blot The bat, the owl, the glowing tyger, and the king of night. The sea fowl takes the wintry blast. for a cov'ring to her limbs: And the wild snake, the pestilence to adorn him with gems &amp; gold. And trees. &amp; birds. &amp; beasts. &amp; men. behold their eternal joy. Arise you little glancing wings, and sing your infant joy! Arise and drink your bliss, for every thing that lives is holy! Thus every morning wails Oothoon. but Theotormon sits Upon the margind ocean conversing with shadows dire. The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, &amp; eccho back her sighs. The End AMERICA a PROPHECY LAMBETH Printed by William Blake in the year 1793 PLATE 1 PRELUDIUM The shadowy daughter of Urthona stood before red Orc. When fourteen suns had faintly journey'd o'er his dark abode; His food she brought in iron baskets, his drink in cups of iron; Crown'd with a helmet &amp; dark hair the nameless female stood; A quiver with its burning stores, a bow like that of night, When pestilence is shot from heaven; no other arms she need: Invulnerable tho' naked, save where clouds roll round her loins, Their awful folds in the dark air; silent she stood as night; For never from her iron tongue could voice or sound arise; But dumb till that dread day when Orc assay'd his fierce embrace. Dark virgin; said the hairy youth, thy father stern abhorr'd; Rivets my tenfold chains while still on high my spirit soars; Sometimes an eagle screaming in the sky, sometimes a lion, Stalking upon the mountains, &amp; sometimes a whale I lash The raging fathomless abyss, anon a serpent folding Around the pillars of Urthona, and round thy dark limbs, On the Canadian wilds I fold, feeble my spirit folds. For chaind beneath I rend these caverns; when thou bringest food I howl my joy! and my red eyes seek to behold thy face In vain! these clouds roll to &amp; fro, &amp; hide thee from my sight. PLATE 2 Silent as despairing love, and strong as jealousy, The hairy shoulders rend the links, free are the wrists of fire; Round the terrific loins he siez'd the panting struggling womb; It joy'd: she put aside her clouds &amp; smiled her first-born smile; As when a black cloud shews its light'nings to the silent deep. Soon as she saw the terrible boy then burst the virgin cry. I know thee, I have found thee, &amp; I will not let thee go; Thou art the image of God who dwells in darkness of Africa; And thou art fall'n to give me life in regions of dark death. On my American plains I feel the struggling afflictions Endur'd by roots that writhe their arms into the nether deep: I see a serpent in Canada, who courts me to his love; In Mexico an Eagle, and a Lion in Peru; I see a Whale in the South-sea, drinking my soul away. O what limb rending pains I feel. thy fire &amp; my frost Mingle in howling pains, in furrows by thy lightnings rent; This is eternal death; and this the torment long foretold. The stern Bard ceas'd, asham'd of his own song; enrag'd he swung His harp aloft sounding, then dash'd its shining frame against A ruin'd pillar in glittring fragments; silent he turn'd away, And wander'd down the vales of Kent in sick &amp; drear lamentings. PLATE 3 A PROPHECY The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent, Sullen fires across the Atlantic glow to America's shore: Piercing the souls of warlike men, who rise in silent night, Washington, Franklin, Paine &amp; Warren, Gates, Hancock &amp; Green; Meet on the coast glowing with blood from Albions fiery Prince. Washington spoke; Friends of America look over the Atlantic sea; A bended bow is lifted in heaven, &amp; a heavy iron chain Descends link by link from Albions cliffs across the sea to bind Brothers &amp; sons of America, till our faces pale and yellow; Hands deprest, voices weak, eyes downcast, hands work-bruis'd, Feet bleeding on the sultry sands, and the furrows of the whip Descend to generations that in future times forget.— The strong voice ceas'd; for a terrible blast swept over the heaving sea; The eastern cloud rent; on his cliffs stood Albions wrathful Prince A dragon form clashing his scales at midnight he arose, And flam'd red meteors round the land of Albion beneath[.] His voice, his locks, his awful shoulders, and his glowing eyes, PLATE 4 Appear to the Americans upon the cloudy night. Solemn heave the Atlantic waves between the gloomy nations, Swelling, belching from its deeps red clouds &amp; raging Fires! Albion is sick! America faints! enrag'd the Zenith grew. As human blood shooting its veins all round the orbed heaven Red rose the clouds from the Atlantic in vast wheels of blood And in the red clouds rose a Wonder o'er the Atlantic sea; Intense! naked! a Human fire fierce glowing, as the wedge Of iron heated in the furnace; his terrible limbs were fire With myriads of cloudy terrors banners dark &amp; towers Surrounded; heat but not light went thro' the murky atmosphere The King of England looking westward trembles at the vision PLATE 5 Albions Angel stood beside the Stone of night, and saw The terror like a comet, or more like the planet red That once inclos'd the terrible wandering comets in its sphere. Then Mars thou wast our center, &amp; the planets three flew round Thy crimson disk; so e'er the Sun was rent from thy red sphere; The Spectre glowd his horrid length staining the temple long With beams of blood; &amp; thus a voice came forth, and shook the temple PLATE 6 The morning comes, the night decays, the watchmen leave their stations; The grave is burst, the spices shed, the linen wrapped up; The bones of death, the cov'ring clay, the sinews shrunk &amp; dry'd. Reviving shake, inspiring move, breathing! awakening! Spring like redeemed captives when their bonds &amp; bars are burst; Let the slave grinding at the mill, run out into the field: Let him look up into the heavens &amp; laugh in the bright air; Let the inchained soul shut up in darkness and in sighing, Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary years; Rise and look out, his chains are loose, his dungeon doors are open. And let his wife and children return from the opressors scourge; They look behind at every step &amp; believe it is a dream. Singing. The Sun has left his blackness, &amp; has found a fresher morning And the fair Moon rejoices in the clear &amp; cloudless night; For Empire is no more, and now the Lion &amp; Wolf shall cease. PLATE 7 In thunders ends the voice. Then Albions Angel wrathful burnt Beside the Stone of Night; and like the Eternal Lions howl In famine &amp; war, reply'd. Art thou not Orc; who serpent-form'd Stands at the gate of Enitharmon to devour her children; Blasphemous Demon, Antichrist, hater of Dignities; Lover of wild rebellion, and transgresser of Gods Law; Why dost thou come to Angels eyes in this terrific form? PLATE 8 The terror answerd: I am Orc, wreath'd round the accursed tree: The times are ended; shadows pass the morning gins to break; The fiery joy, that Urizen perverted to ten commands, What night he led the starry hosts thro' the wide wilderness: That stony law I stamp to dust: and scatter religion abroad To the four winds as a torn book, &amp; none shall gather the leaves; But they shall rot on desart sands, &amp; consume in bottomless deeps; To make the desarts blossom, &amp; the deeps shrink to their fountains, And to renew the fiery joy, and burst the stony roof. That pale religious letchery, seeking Virginity, May find it in a harlot, and in coarse-clad honesty The undefil'd tho' ravish'd in her cradle night and morn: For every thing that lives is holy, life delights in life; Because the soul of sweet delight can never be defil'd. Fires inwrap the earthly globe, yet man is not consumd; Amidst the lustful fires he walks: his feet become like brass, His knees and thighs like silver, &amp; his breast and head like gold. PLATE 9 Sound! sound! my loud war-trumpets &amp; alarm my Thirteen Angels! Loud howls the eternal Wolf! the eternal Lion lashes his tail! America is darkned; and my punishing Demons terrified Crouch howling before their caverns deep like skins dry'd in the wind. They cannot smite the wheat, nor quench the fatness of the earth. They cannot smite with sorrows, nor subdue the plow and spade. They cannot wall the city, nor moat round the castle of princes. They cannot bring the stubbed oak to overgrow the hills. For terrible men stand on the shores, &amp; in their robes I see Children take shelter from the lightnings, there stands Washington And Paine and Warren with their foreheads reard toward the east But clouds obscure my aged sight. A vision from afar! Sound! sound! my loud war-trumpets &amp; alarm my thirteen Angels: Ah vision from afar! Ah rebel form that rent the ancient Heavens; Eternal Viper self-renew'd, rolling in clouds I see thee in thick clouds and darkness on America's shore. Writhing in pangs of abhorred birth; red flames the crest rebellious And eyes of death; the harlot womb oft opened in vain Heaves in enormous circles, now the times are return'd upon thee, Devourer of thy parent, now thy unutterable torment renews. Sound! sound! my loud war trumpets &amp; alarm my thirteen Angels! Ah terrible birth! a young one bursting! where is the weeping mouth? And where the mothers milk? instead those ever-hissing jaws And parched lips drop with fresh gore; now roll thou in the clouds Thy mother lays her length outstretch'd upon the shore beneath. Sound! sound! my loud war-trumpets &amp; alarm my thirteen Angels! Loud howls the eternal Wolf: the eternal Lion lashes his tail! PLATE 10 Thus wept the Angel voice &amp; as he wept the terrible blasts Of trumpets, blew a loud alarm across the Atlantic deep. No trumpets answer; no reply of clarions or of fifes, Silent the Colonies remain and refuse the loud alarm. On those vast shady hills between America &amp; Albions shore; Now barr'd out by the Atlantic sea: call'd Atlantean hills: Because from their bright summits you may pass to the Golden world An ancient palace, archetype of mighty Emperies, Rears its immortal pinnacles, built in the forest of God By Ariston the king of beauty for his stolen bride, Here on their magic seats the thirteen Angels sat perturb'd For clouds from the Atlantic hover o'er the solemn roof. PLATE 11 Fiery the Angels rose, &amp; as they rose deep thunder roll'd Around their shores: indignant burning with the fires of Orc And Bostons Angel cried aloud as they flew thro' the dark night. He cried: Why trembles honesty and like a murderer, Why seeks he refuge from the frowns of his immortal station! Must the generous tremble &amp; leave his joy, to the idle: to the pestilence! That mock him? who commanded this? what God? what Angel! To keep the gen'rous from experience till the ungenerous Are unrestraind performers of the energies of nature; Till pity is become a trade, and generosity a science, That men get rich by, &amp; the sandy desart is giv'n to the strong What God is he, writes laws of peace, &amp; clothes him in a tempest What pitying Angel lusts for tears, and fans himself with sighs What crawling villain preaches abstinence &amp; wraps himself In fat of lambs? no more I follow, no more obedience pay. PLATE 12 So cried he, rending off his robe &amp; throwing down his scepter. In sight of Albions Guardian, and all the thirteen Angels Rent off their robes to the hungry wind, &amp; threw their golden scepters Down on the land of America. indignant they descended Headlong from out their heav'nly heights, descending swift as fires Over the land; naked &amp; flaming are their lineaments seen In the deep gloom, by Washington &amp; Paine &amp; Warren they stood And the flame folded roaring fierce within the pitchy night Before the Demon red, who burnt towards America, In black smoke thunders and loud winds rejoicing in its terror Breaking in smoky wreaths from the wild deep, &amp; gath'ring thick In flames as of a furnace on the land from North to South PLATE 13 What time the thirteen Governors that England sent convene In Bernards house; the flames coverd the land, they rouze they cry Shaking their mental chains they rush in fury to the sea To quench their anguish; at the feet of Washington down fall'n They grovel on the sand and writhing lie, while all The British soldiers thro' the thirteen states sent up a howl Of anguish: threw their swords &amp; muskets to the earth &amp; ran From their encampments and dark castles seeking where to hide From the grim flames; and from the visions of Orc: in sight Of Albions Angel; who enrag'd his secret clouds open'd From north to south, and burnt outstretchd on wings of wrath cov'ring The eastern sky, spreading his awful wings across the heavens; Beneath him roll'd his num'rous hosts, all Albions Angels camp'd Darkend the Atlantic mountains &amp; their trumpets shook the valleys Arm'd with diseases of the earth to cast upon the Abyss, Their numbers forty millions, must'ring in the eastern sky. PLATE 14 In the flames stood &amp; view'd the armies drawn out in the sky Washington Franklin Paine &amp; Warren Allen Gates &amp; Lee: And heard the voice of Albions Angel give the thunderous command: His plagues obedient to his voice flew forth out of their clouds Falling upon America, as a storm to cut them off As a blight cuts the tender corn when it begins to appear. Dark is the heaven above, &amp; cold &amp; hard the earth beneath; And as a plague wind fill'd with insects cuts off man &amp; beast; And as a sea o'erwhelms a land in the day of an earthquake: Fury! rage! madness! in a wind swept through America And the red flames of Orc that folded roaring fierce around The angry shores, and the fierce rushing of th'inhabitants together: The citizens of New-York close their books &amp; lock their chests; The mariners of Boston drop their anchors and unlade; The scribe of Pensylvania casts his pen upon the earth; The builder of Virginia throws his hammer down in fear. Then had America been lost, o'erwhelm'd by the Atlantic, And Earth had lost another portion of the infinite, But all rush together in the night in wrath and raging fire The red fires rag'd! the plagues recoil'd! then rolld they back with fury PLATE 15 On Albions Angels; then the Pestilence began in streaks of red Across the limbs of Albions Guardian, the spotted plague smote Bristols And the Leprosy Londons Spirit, sickening all their bands: The millions sent up a howl of anguish and threw off their hammerd mail, And cast their swords &amp; spears to earth, &amp; stood a naked multitude. Albions Guardian writhed in torment on the eastern sky Pale quivring toward the brain his glimmering eyes, teeth chattering Howling &amp; shuddering his legs quivering; convuls'd each muscle &amp; sinew Sick'ning lay Londons Guardian, and the ancient miter'd York Their heads on snowy hills, their ensigns sick'ning in the sky The plagues creep on the burning winds driven by flames of Orc, And by the fierce Americans rushing together in the night Driven o'er the Guardians of Ireland and Scotland and Wales They spotted with plagues forsook the frontiers &amp; their banners seard With fires of hell, deform their ancient heavens with shame &amp; woe. Hid in his caves the Bard of Albion felt the enormous plagues. And a cowl of flesh grew o'er his head &amp; scales on his back &amp; ribs; And rough with black scales all his Angels fright their ancient heavens The doors of marriage are open, and the Priests in rustling scales Rush into reptile coverts, hiding from the fires of Orc, That play around the golden roofs in wreaths of fierce desire, Leaving the females naked and glowing with the lusts of youth For the female spirits of the dead pining in bonds of religion; Run from their fetters reddening, &amp; in long drawn arches sitting: They feel the nerves of youth renew, and desires of ancient times, Over their pale limbs as a vine when the tender grape appears PLATE 16 Over the hills, the vales, the cities, rage the red flames fierce; The Heavens melted from north to south; and Urizen who sat Above all heavens in thunders wrap'd, emerg'd his leprous head From out his holy shrine, his tears in deluge piteous Falling into the deep sublime! flag'd with grey-brow'd snows And thunderous visages, his jealous wings wav'd over the deep; Weeping in dismal howling woe he dark descended howling Around the smitten bands, clothed in tears &amp; trembling shudd'ring cold. His stored snows he poured forth, and his icy magazines He open'd on the deep, and on the Atlantic sea white shiv'ring. Leprous his limbs, all over white, and hoary was his visage. Weeping in dismal howlings before the stern Americans Hiding the Demon red with clouds &amp; cold mists from the earth; Till Angels &amp; weak men twelve years should govern o'er the strong: And then their end should come, when France reciev'd the Demons light. Stiff shudderings shook the heav'nly thrones! France Spain &amp; Italy, In terror view'd the bands of Albion, and the ancient Guardians Fainting upon the elements, smitten with their own plagues They slow advance to shut the five gates of their law-built heaven Filled with blasting fancies and with mildews of despair With fierce disease and lust, unable to stem the fires of Orc; But the five gates were consum'd, &amp; their bolts and hinges melted And the fierce flames burnt round the heavens, &amp; round the abodes of men FINIS [Canceled Plates] PLATE b Reveal the dragon thro' the human; coursing swift as fire To the close hall of counsel, where his Angel form renews. In a sweet vale shelter'd with cedars, that eternal stretch Their unmov'd branches, stood the hall; built when the moon shot forth, In that dread night when Urizen call'd the stars round his feet; Then burst the center from its orb, and found a place beneath; And Earth conglob'd, in narrow room, roll'd round its sulphur Sun. To this deep valley situated by the flowing Thames; Where George the third holds council. &amp; his Lords &amp; Commons meet: Shut out from mortal sight the Angel came; the vale was dark With clouds of smoke from the Atlantic, that in volumes roll'd Between the mountains, dismal visions mope around the house. On chairs of iron, canopied with mystic ornaments Of life by magic power condens'd; infernal forms art-bound The council sat; all rose before the aged apparition; His snowy beard that streams like lambent flames down his wide breast Wetting with tears, &amp; his white garments cast a wintry light. Then as arm'd clouds arise terrific round the northern drum; The world is silent at the flapping of the folding banners; So still terrors rent the house: as when the solemn globe Launch'd to the unknown shore, while Sotha held the northern helm, Till to that void it came &amp; fell; so the dark house was rent, The valley mov'd beneath; its shining pillars split in twain, And its roofs crack across down falling on th'Angelic seats. PLATE c (as revised) [Then Albions Angel rose] resolv'd to the cove of armoury: His shield that bound twelve demons &amp; their cities in its orb, He took down from its trembling pillar; from its cavern deep, His helm was brought by Londons Guardian, &amp; his thirsty spear By the wise spirit of Londons river: silent stood the King breathing damp mists: And on his aged limbs they clasp'd the armour of terrible gold. Infinite Londons awful spires cast a dreadful cold Even on rational things beneath, and from the palace walls Around Saint James's chill &amp; heavy, even to the city gate. On the vast stone whose name is Truth he stood, his cloudy shield Smote with his scepter, the scale bound orb loud howld; th'ancie[nt] pillar Trembling sunk, an earthquake roll'd along the mossy pile. In glittring armour, swift as winds; intelligent as clouds; Four winged heralds mount the furious blasts &amp; blow their trumps Gold, silver, brass &amp; iron clangors clamoring rend the shores. Like white clouds rising from the deeps, his fifty-two armies From the four cliffs of Albion rise, mustering around their Prince; Angels of cities and of parishes and villages and families, In armour as the nerves of wisdom, each his station holds. In opposition dire, a warlike cloud the myriads stood In the red air before the Demon; [seen even by mortal men: Who call it Fancy, or shut the gates of sense &amp; in their chambers, Sleep like the dead.] But like a constellation ris'n and blazing Over the rugged ocean; so the Angels of Albion hung a frowning shadow, like an aged King in arms of gold, Who wept over a den, in which his only son outstretch'd By rebels hands was slain; his white beard wav'd in the wild wind. On mountains &amp; cliffs of snow the awful apparition hover'd; And like the voices of religious dead, heard in the mountains: When holy zeal scents the sweet valleys of ripe virgin bliss; Such was the hollow voice that o'er America lamented. [Fragment] [PLATE d] As when a dream of Thiralatha flies the midnight hour: In vain the dreamer grasps the joyful images, they fly Seen in obscured traces in the Vale of Leutha, So The British Colonies beneath the woful Princes fade. And so the Princes fade from earth, scarce seen by souls of men But tho' obscur'd, this is the form of the Angelic land. EUROPE a PROPHECY LAMBETH Printed by Will: Blake 1794 PLATE iii Five windows light the cavern'd Man; thro' one he breathes the air; Thro' one, hears music of the spheres; thro' one, the eternal vine Flourishes, that he may recieve the grapes; thro' one can look. And see small portions of the eternal world that ever groweth; Thro' one, himself pass out what time he please, but he will not; For stolen joys are sweet, &amp; bread eaten in secret pleasant. So sang a Fairy mocking as he sat on a streak'd Tulip, Thinking none saw him: when he ceas'd I started from the trees! And caught him in my hat as boys knock down a butterfly How know you this said I small Sir? where did you learn this song Seeing himself in my possession thus he answerd me: My master, I am yours. command me, for I must obey. Then tell me, what is the material world, and is it dead? He laughing answer'd: I will write a book on leaves of flowers, If you will feed me on love-thoughts, &amp; give me now and then A cup of sparkling poetic fancies; so when I am tipsie, I'll sing to you to this soft lute; and shew you all alive The world, where every particle of dust breathes forth its joy. I took him home in my warm bosom: as we went along Wild flowers I gatherd; &amp; he shew'd me each eternal flower: He laugh'd aloud to see them whimper because they were pluck'd. They hover'd round me like a cloud of incense: when I came Into my parlour and sat down, and took my pen to write: My Fairy sat upon the table, and dictated EUROPE. PLATE 1 PRELUDIUM The nameless shadowy female rose from out the breast of Orc: Her snaky hair brandishing in the winds of Enitharmon; And thus her voice arose. O mother Enitharmon wilt thou bring forth other sons? To cause my name to vanish, that my place may not be found. For I am faint with travel! Like the dark cloud disburdend in the day of dismal thunder. My roots are brandish'd in the heavens. my fruits in earth beneath Surge, foam, and labour into life, first born &amp; first consum'd! Consumed and consuming! Then why shouldst thou accursed mother bring me into life? I wrap my turban of thick clouds around my lab'ring head; And fold the sheety waters as a mantle round my limbs. Yet the red sun and moon, And all the overflowing stars rain down prolific pains. PLATE 2 Unwilling I look up to heaven! unwilling count the stars! Sitting in fathomless abyss of my immortal shrine. I sieze their burning power And bring forth howling terrors, all devouring fiery kings. Devouring &amp; devoured roaming on dark and desolate mountains In forests of eternal death, shrieking in hollow trees. Ah mother Enitharmon! Stamp not with solid form this vig'rous progeny of fires. I bring forth from my teeming bosom myriads of flames. And thou dost stamp them with a signet, then they roam abroad And leave me void as death: Ah! I am drown'd in shady woe, and visionary joy. And who shall bind the infinite with an eternal band? To compass it with swaddling bands? and who shall cherish it With milk and honey? I see it smile &amp; I roll inward &amp; my voice is past. She ceast &amp; rolld her shady clouds Into the secret place. PLATE 3 A PROPHECY The deep of winter came; What time the secret child, Descended thro' the orient gates of the eternal day: War ceas'd, &amp; all the troops like shadows fled to their abodes. Then Enitharmon saw her sons &amp; daughters rise around. Like pearly clouds they meet together in the crystal house: And Los, possessor of the moon, joy'd in the peaceful night: Thus speaking while his num'rous sons shook their bright fiery wings Again the night is come That strong Urthona takes his rest, And Urizen unloos'd from chains Glows like a meteor in the distant north Stretch forth your hands and strike the elemental strings! Awake the thunders of the deep, PLATE 4 The shrill winds wake! Till all the sons of Urizen look out and envy Los: Sieze all the spirits of life and bind Their warbling joys to our loud strings Bind all the nourishing sweets of earth To give us bliss, that we may drink the sparkling wine of Los And let us laugh at war, Despising toil and care, Because the days and nights of joy, in lucky hours renew. Arise O Orc from thy deep den, First born of Enitharmon rise! And we will crown thy head with garlands of the ruddy vine; For now thou art bound; And I may see thee in the hour of bliss, my eldest born. The horrent Demon rose, surrounded with red stars of fire, Whirling about in furious circles round the immortal fiend. Then Enitharmon down descended into his red light, And thus her voice rose to her children, the distant heavens reply: PLATE 6 Now comes the night of Enitharmons joy! Who shall I call? Who shall I send? That Woman, lovely Woman! may have dominion? Arise O Rintrah thee I call! &amp; Palamabron thee! Go! tell the Human race that Womans love is Sin! That an Eternal life awaits the worms of sixty winters In an allegorical abode where existence hath never come: Forbid all Joy, &amp; from her childhood shall the little female Spread nets in every secret path. My weary eyelids draw towards the evening, my bliss is yet but new. PLATE 8 Arise O Rintrah eldest born: second to none but Orc: O lion Rintrah raise thy fury from thy forests black: Bring Palamabron horned priest, skipping upon the mountains: And silent Elynittria the silver bowed queen: Rintrah where hast thou hid thy bride! Weeps she in desart shades? Alas my Rintrah! bring the lovely jealous Ocalythron. Arise my son! bring all thy brethren O thou king of fire. Prince of the sun I see thee with thy innumerable race: Thick as the summer stars: But each ramping his golden mane shakes, And thine eyes rejoice because of strength O Rintrah furious king PLATE 9 Enitharmon slept, Eighteen hundred years: Man was a Dream! The night of Nature and their harps unstrung: She slept in middle of her nightly song, Eighteen hundred years, a female dream! Shadows of men in fleeting bands upon the winds: Divide the heavens of Europe: Till Albions Angel smitten with his own plagues fled with his bands The cloud bears hard on Albions shore: Fill'd with immortal demons of futurity: In council gather the smitten Angels of Albion The cloud bears hard upon the council house; down rushing On the heads of Albions Angels. One hour they lay buried beneath the ruins of that hall; But as the stars rise from the salt lake they arise in pain, In troubled mists o'erclouded by the terrors of strugling times. PLATE 10 In thoughts perturb'd, they rose from the bright ruins silent following The fiery King, who sought his ancient temple serpent-form'd That stretches out its shady length along the Island white. Round him roll'd his clouds of war; silent the Angel went, Along the infinite shores of Thames to golden Verulam. There stand the venerable porches that high-towering rear Their oak-surrounded pillars, form'd of massy stones, uncut With tool; stones precious; such eternal in the heavens, Of colours twelve, few known on earth, give light in the opake, Plac'd in the order of the stars, when the five senses whelm'd In deluge o'er the earth-born man; then turn'd the fluxile eyes Into two stationary orbs, concentrating all things. The ever-varying spiral ascents to the heavens of heavens Were bended downward; and the nostrils golden gates shut Turn'd outward, barr'd and petrify'd against the infinite. Thought chang'd the infinite to a serpent; that which pitieth: To a devouring flame; and man fled from its face and hid In forests of night; then all the eternal forests were divided Into earths rolling in circles of space, that like an ocean rush'd And overwhelmed all except this finite wall of flesh. Then was the serpent temple form'd, image of infinite Shut up in finite revolutions, and man became an Angel; Heaven a mighty circle turning; God a tyrant crown'd. Now arriv'd the ancient Guardian at the southern porch, That planted thick with trees of blackest leaf, &amp; in a vale Obscure, enclos'd the Stone of Night; oblique it stood, o'erhung With purple flowers and berries red; image of that sweet south, Once open to the heavens and elevated on the human neck, Now overgrown with hair and coverd with a stony roof, Downward 'tis sunk beneath th'attractive north, that round the feet A raging whirlpool draws the dizzy enquirer to his grave: PLATE 11 Albions Angel rose upon the Stone of Night. He saw Urizen on the Atlantic; And his brazen Book, That Kings &amp; Priests had copied on Earth Expanded from North to South. PLATE 12 And the clouds &amp; fires pale rolld round in the night of Enitharmon Round Albions cliffs &amp; Londons walls; still Enitharmon slept! Rolling volumes of grey mist involve Churches, Palaces, Towers: For Urizen unclaspd his Book! feeding his soul with pity The youth of England hid in gloom curse the paind heavens; compell'd Into the deadly night to see the form of Albions Angel Their parents brought them forth &amp; aged ignorance preaches canting, On a vast rock, percievd by those senses that are clos'd from thought: Bleak, dark, abrupt, it stands &amp; overshadows London city They saw his boney feet on the rock, the flesh consum'd in flames: They saw the Serpent temple lifted above, shadowing the Island white: They heard the voice of Albions Angel howling in flames of Orc, Seeking the trump of the last doom Above the rest the howl was heard from Westminster louder &amp; louder: The Guardian of the secret codes forsook his ancient mansion, Driven out by the flames of Orc; his furr'd robes &amp; false locks Adhered and grew one with his flesh, and nerves &amp; veins shot thro' them With dismal torment sick, hanging upon the wind: he fled Groveling along Great George Street thro' the Park gate; all the soldiers Fled from his sight: he drag'd his torments to the wilderness. Thus was the howl thro Europe! For Orc rejoic'd to hear the howling shadows But Palamabron shot his lightnings trenching down his wide back And Rintrah hung with all his legions in the nether deep Enitharmon laugh'd in her sleep to see (O womans triumph) Every house a den, every man bound; the shadows are filld With spectres, and the windows wove over with curses of iron: Over the doors Thou shalt not; &amp; over the chimneys Fear is written: With bands of iron round their necks fasten'd into the walls The citizens: in leaden gyves the inhabitants of suburbs Walk heavy: soft and bent are the bones of villagers Between the clouds of Urizen the flames of Orc roll heavy Around the limbs of Albions Guardian, his flesh consuming. Howlings &amp; hissings, shrieks &amp; groans, &amp; voices of despair Arise around him in the cloudy Heavens of Albion, Furious PLATE 13 The red limb'd Angel siez'd, in horror and torment; The Trump of the last doom; but he could not blow the iron tube! Thrice he assay'd presumptuous to awake the dead to Judgment. A mighty Spirit leap'd from the land of Albion, Nam'd Newton; he siez'd the Trump, &amp; blow'd the enormous blast! Yellow as leaves of Autumn the myriads of Angelic hosts, Fell thro' the wintry skies seeking their graves; Rattling their hollow bones in howling and lamentation. Then Enitharmon woke, nor knew that she had slept And eighteen hundred years were fled As if they had not been She calld her sons &amp; daughters To the sports of night, Within her crystal house; And thus her song proceeds. Arise Ethinthus! tho' the earth-worm call; Let him call in vain; Till the night of holy shadows And human solitude is past! PLATE 14 Ethinthus queen of waters, how thou shinest in the sky: My daughter how do I rejoice! for thy children flock around Like the gay fishes on the wave, when the cold moon drinks the dew. Ethinthus! thou art sweet as comforts to my fainting soul: For now thy waters warble round the feet of Enitharmon. Manathu-Vorcyon! I behold thee flaming in my halls, Light of thy mothers soul! I see thy lovely eagles round; Thy golden wings are my delight, &amp; thy flames of soft delusion. Where is my lureing bird of Eden! Leutha silent love! Leutha, the many colourd bow delights upon thy wings: Soft soul of flowers Leutha! Sweet smiling pestilence! I see thy blushing light: Thy daughters many changing, Revolve like sweet perfumes ascending O Leutha silken queen! Where is the youthful Antamon. prince of the pearly dew, O Antamon, why wilt thou leave thy mother Enitharmon? Alone I see thee crystal form, Floting upon the bosomd air: With lineaments of gratified desire. My Antamon the seven churches of Leutha seek thy love. I hear the soft Oothoon in Enitharmons tents: Why wilt thou give up womans secrecy my melancholy child? Between two moments bliss is ripe: O Theotormon robb'd of joy, I see thy salt tears flow Down the steps of my crystal house. Sotha &amp; Thiralatha, secret dwellers of dreamful caves, Arise and please the horrent fiend with your melodious songs. Still all your thunders golden hoofd, &amp; bind your horses black. Orc! smile upon my children! Smile son of my afflictions. Arise O Orc and give our mountains joy of thy red light. She ceas'd, for All were forth at sport beneath the solemn moon Waking the stars of Urizen with their immortal songs, That nature felt thro' all her pores the enormous revelry, Till morning ope'd the eastern gate. Then every one fled to his station, &amp; Enitharmon wept. But terrible Orc, when he beheld the morning in the east, PLATE 15 Shot from the heights of Enitharmon; And in the vineyards of red France appear'd the light of his fury. The sun glow'd fiery red! The furious terrors flew around! On golden chariots raging, with red wheels dropping with blood; The Lions lash their wrathful tails! The Tigers couch upon the prey &amp; suck the ruddy tide: And Enitharmon groans &amp; cries in anguish and dismay. Then Los arose his head he reard in snaky thunders clad: And with a cry that shook all nature to the utmost pole, Call'd all his sons to the strife of blood. FINIS THE SONG of LOS LAMBETH Printed by W Blake 1795 PLATE 3 AFRICA I will sing you a song of Los. the Eternal Prophet: He sung it to four harps at the tables of Eternity. In heart-formed Africa. Urizen faded! Ariston shudderd! And thus the Song began Adam stood in the garden of Eden: And Noah on the mountains of Ararat; They saw Urizen give his Laws to the Nations By the hands of the children of Los. Adam shudderd! Noah faded! black grew the sunny African When Rintrah gave Abstract Philosophy to Brama in the East: (Night spoke to the Cloud! Lo these Human form'd spirits in smiling hipocrisy War Against one another; so let them War on; slaves to the eternal Elements) Noah shrunk, beneath the waters; Abram fled in fires from Chaldea; Moses beheld upon Mount Sinai forms of dark delusion: To Trismegistus. Palamabron gave an abstract Law: To Pythagoras Socrates &amp; Plato. Times rolled on o'er all the sons of Har, time after time Orc on Mount Atlas howld, chain'd down with the Chain of Jealousy Then Oothoon hoverd over Judah &amp; Jerusalem And Jesus heard her voice (a man of sorrows) he recievd A Gospel from wretched Theotormon. The human race began to wither, for the healthy built Secluded places, fearing the joys of Love And the disease'd only propagated: So Antamon call'd up Leutha from her valleys of delight: And to Mahomet a loose Bible gave. But in the North, to Odin, Sotha gave a Code of War, Because of Diralada thinking to reclaim his joy. PLATE 4 These were the Churches: Hospitals: Castles: Palaces: Like nets &amp; gins &amp; traps to catch the joys of Eternity And all the rest a desart; Till like a dream Eternity was obliterated &amp; erased. Since that dread day when Har and Heva fled. Because their brethren &amp; sisters liv'd in War &amp; Lust; And as they fled they shrunk Into two narrow doleful forms: Creeping in reptile flesh upon The bosom of the ground: And all the vast of Nature shrunk Before their shrunken eyes. Thus the terrible race of Los &amp; Enitharmon gave Laws &amp; Religions to the sons of Har binding them more And more to Earth: closing and restraining: Till a Philosophy of Five Senses was complete Urizen wept &amp; gave it into the hands of Newton &amp; Locke Clouds roll heavy upon the Alps round Rousseau &amp; Voltaire: And on the mountains of Lebanon round the deceased Gods Of Asia; &amp; on the desarts of Africa round the Fallen Angels The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent PLATE 6 ASIA The Kings of Asia heard The howl rise up from Europe! And each ran out from his Web; From his ancient woven Den; For the darkness of Asia was startled At the thick-flaming, thought-creating fires of Orc. And the Kings of Asia stood And cried in bitterness of soul. Shall not the King call for Famine from the heath? Nor the Priest, for Pestilence from the fen? To restrain! to dismay! to thin! The inhabitants of mountain and plain; In the day, of full-feeding prosperity; And the night of delicious songs. Shall not the Councellor throw his curb Of Poverty on the laborious? To fix the price of labour; To invent allegoric riches: And the privy admonishers of men Call for fires in the City For heaps of smoking ruins, In the night of prosperity &amp; wantonness To turn man from his path, To restrain the child from the womb, PLATE 7 To cut off the bread from the city, That the remnant may learn to obey, That the pride of the heart may fail; That the lust of the eyes, may be quench'd: That the delicate ear in its infancy May be dull'd; and the nostrils clos'd up; To teach mortal worms the path That leads from the gates of the Grave. Urizen heard them cry! And his shudd'ring waving wings Went enormous above the red flames Drawing clouds of despair thro' the heavens Of Europe as he went: And his Books of brass iron &amp; gold Melted over the land as he flew, Heavy-waving, howling, weeping. And he stood over Judea: And stay'd in his ancient place: And stretch'd his clouds over Jerusalem; For Adam, a mouldering skeleton Lay bleach'd on the garden of Eden; And Noah as white as snow On the mountains of Ararat. Then the thunders of Urizen bellow'd aloud From his woven darkness above. Orc, raging in European darkness Arose like a pillar of fire above the Alps Like a serpent of fiery flame! The sullen Earth Shrunk! Forth from the dead dust rattling bones to bones Join: shaking convuls'd the shivring clay breathes And all flesh naked stands: Fathers and Friends; Mothers &amp; Infants; Kings &amp; Warriors: The Grave shrieks with delight, &amp; shakes Her hollow womb, &amp; clasps the solid stem: Her bosom swells with wild desire: And milk &amp; blood &amp; glandous wine In rivers rush &amp; shout &amp; dance, On mountain, dale and plain. The SONG of LOS is Ended. Urizen Wept. THE [FIRST] BOOK of URIZEN LAMBETH. Printed by Will Blake 1794 PLATE 2 PRELUDIUM TO THE [FIRST] BOOK OF URIZEN Of the primeval Priests assum'd power, When Eternals spurn'd back his religion; And gave him a place in the north, Obscure, shadowy, void, solitary. Eternals I hear your call gladly, Dictate swift winged words, &amp; fear not To unfold your dark visions of torment. PLATE 3 Chap: I 1. Lo, a shadow of horror is risen In Eternity! Unknown, unprolific! Self-closd, all-repelling: what Demon Hath form'd this abominable void This soul-shudd'ring vacuum?—Some said “It is Urizen”, But unknown, abstracted Brooding secret, the dark power hid. 2. Times on times he divided, &amp; measur'd Space by space in his ninefold darkness Unseen, unknown! changes appeard In his desolate mountains rifted furious By the black winds of perturbation 3. For he strove in battles dire In unseen conflictions with shapes Bred from his forsaken wilderness, Of beast, bird, fish, serpent &amp; element Combustion, blast, vapour and cloud. 4. Dark revolving in silent activity: Unseen in tormenting passions; An activity unknown and horrible; A self-contemplating shadow, In enormous labours occupied 5. But Eternals beheld his vast forests Age on ages he lay, clos'd, unknown, Brooding shut in the deep; all avoid The petrific abominable chaos 6. His cold horrors silent, dark Urizen Prepar'd: his ten thousands of thunders Rang'd in gloom'd array stretch out across The dread world, &amp; the rolling of wheels As of swelling seas, sound in his clouds In his hills of stor'd snows, in his mountains Of hail &amp; ice; voices of terror, Are heard, like thunders of autumn, When the cloud blazes over the harvests Chap: II. 1. Earth was not: nor globes of attraction The will of the Immortal expanded Or contracted his all flexible senses. Death was not, but eternal life sprung 2. The sound of a trumpet the heavens Awoke &amp; vast clouds of blood roll'd Round the dim rocks of Urizen, so nam'd That solitary one in Immensity 3. Shrill the trumpet: &amp; myriads of Eternity, PLATE 4 Muster around the bleak desarts Now fill'd with clouds, darkness &amp; waters That roll'd perplex'd labring &amp; utter'd Words articulate, bursting in thunders That roll'd on the tops of his mountains 4. From the depths of dark solitude. From The eternal abode in my holiness, Hidden set apart in my stern counsels Reserv'd for the days of futurity, I have sought for a joy without pain, For a solid without fluctuation Why will you die O Eternals? Why live in unquenchable burnings? 5. First I fought with the fire; consum'd Inwards, into a deep world within: A void immense, wild dark &amp; deep, Where nothing was; Natures wide womb[.] And self balanc'd stretch'd o'er the void I alone, even I! the winds merciless Bound; but condensing, in torrents They fall &amp; fall; strong I repell'd The vast waves, &amp; arose on the waters A wide world of solid obstruction 6. Here alone I in books formd of metals Have written the secrets of wisdom The secrets of dark contemplation By fightings and conflicts dire, With terrible monsters Sin-bred: Which the bosoms of all inhabit; Seven deadly Sins of the soul. 7. Lo! I unfold my darkness: and on This rock, place with strong hand the Book Of eternal brass, written in my solitude. 8. Laws of peace, of love, of unity: Of pity, compassion, forgiveness. Let each chuse one habitation: His ancient infinite mansion: One command, one joy, one desire, One curse, one weight, one measure One King, one God, one Law. Chap: III. 1. The voice ended, they saw his pale visage Emerge from the darkness; his hand On the rock of eternity unclasping The Book of brass. Rage siez'd the strong 2. Rage, fury, intense indignation In cataracts of fire blood &amp; gall In whirlwinds of sulphurous smoke: And enormous forms of energy; All the seven deadly sins of the soul PLATE 5 In living creations appear'd In the flames of eternal fury. 3. Sund'ring, dark'ning, thund'ring! Rent away with a terrible crash Eternity roll'd wide apart Wide asunder rolling Mountainous all around Departing; departing; departing: Leaving ruinous fragments of life Hanging frowning cliffs &amp; all between An ocean of voidness unfathomable. 4. The roaring fires ran o'er the heav'ns In whirlwinds &amp; cataracts of blood And o'er the dark desarts of Urizen Fires pour thro' the void on all sides On Urizens self-begotten armies. 5. But no light from the fires. all was darkness In the flames of Eternal fury 6. In fierce anguish &amp; quenchless flames To the desarts and rocks He ran raging To hide, but He could not: combining He dug mountains &amp; hills in vast strength, He piled them in incessant labour, In howlings &amp; pangs &amp; fierce madness Long periods in burning fires labouring Till hoary, and age-broke, and aged, In despair and the shadows of death. 7. And a roof, vast petrific around, On all sides He fram'd: like a womb; Where thousands of rivers in veins Of blood pour down the mountains to cool The eternal fires beating without From Eternals; &amp; like a black globe View'd by sons of Eternity, standing On the shore of the infinite ocean Like a human heart strugling &amp; beating The vast world of Urizen appear'd. 8. And Los round the dark globe of Urizen, Kept watch for Eternals to confine, The obscure separation alone; For Eternity stood wide apart, PLATE 6 As the stars are apart from the earth 9. Los wept howling around the dark Demon: And cursing his lot; for in anguish, Urizen was rent from his side; And a fathomless void for his feet; And intense fires for his dwelling. 10. But Urizen laid in a stony sleep Unorganiz'd, rent from Eternity 11. The Eternals said: What is this? Death[.] Urizen is a clod of clay. PLATE 7 12 Los howld in a dismal stupor, Groaning! gnashing! groaning! Till the wrenching apart was healed 13 But the wrenching of Urizen heal'd not Cold, featureless, flesh or clay, Rifted with direful changes He lay in a dreamless night 14 Till Los rouz'd his fires, affrighted At the formless unmeasurable death. PLATE 8 Chap: IV [a] 1 Los smitten with astonishment Frightend at the hurtling bones 2 And at the surging sulphureous Perturbed Immortal mad raging 3 In whirlwinds &amp; pitch &amp; nitre Round the furious limbs of Los 4 And Los formed nets &amp; gins And threw the nets round about 5 He watch'd in shuddring fear The dark changes &amp; bound every change With rivets of iron &amp; brass; 6. And these were the changes of Urizen. PLATE 10 [b] 1. Ages on ages roll'd over him! In stony sleep ages roll'd over him! Like a dark waste stretching chang'able By earthquakes riv'n, belching sullen fires On ages roll'd ages in ghastly Sick torment; around him in whirlwinds Of darkness the eternal Prophet howl'd Beating still on his rivets of iron Pouring sodor of iron; dividing The horrible night into watches. 2. And Urizen (so his eternal name) His prolific delight obscurd more &amp; more In dark secresy hiding in surgeing Sulphureous fluid his phantasies. The Eternal Prophet heavd the dark bellows, And turn'd restless the tongs; and the hammer Incessant beat; forging chains new &amp; new Numb'ring with links. hours, days &amp; years 3. The eternal mind bounded began to roll Eddies of wrath ceaseless round &amp; round, And the sulphureous foam surgeing thick Settled, a lake, bright, &amp; shining clear: White as the snow on the mountains cold. 4. Forgetfulness, dumbness, necessity! In chains of the mind locked up, Like fetters of ice shrinking together Disorganiz'd, rent from Eternity, Los beat on his fetters of iron; And heated his furnaces &amp; pour'd Iron sodor and sodor of brass 5. Restless turnd the immortal inchain'd Heaving dolorous! anguish'd! unbearable Till a roof shaggy wild inclos'd In an orb, his fountain of thought. 6. In a horrible dreamful slumber; Like the linked infernal chain; A vast Spine writh'd in torment Upon the winds; shooting pain'd Ribs, like a bending cavern And bones of solidness, froze Over all his nerves of joy. And a first Age passed over, And a state of dismal woe. PLATE 11 7. From the caverns of his jointed Spine, Down sunk with fright a red Round globe hot burning deep Deep down into the Abyss: Panting: Conglobing, Trembling Shooting out ten thousand branches Around his solid bones. And a second Age passed over, And a state of dismal woe. 8. In harrowing fear rolling round; His nervous brain shot branches Round the branches of his heart. On high into two little orbs And fixed in two little caves Hiding carefully from the wind, His Eyes beheld the deep, And a third Age passed over: And a state of dismal woe. 9. The pangs of hope began, In heavy pain striving, struggling. Two Ears in close volutions. From beneath his orbs of vision Shot spiring out and petrified As they grew. And a fourth Age passed And a state of dismal woe. 10. In ghastly torment sick; Hanging upon the wind; PLATE 13 Two Nostrils bent down to the deep. And a fifth Age passed over; And a state of dismal woe. 11. In ghastly torment sick; Within his ribs bloated round, A craving Hungry Cavern; Thence arose his channeld Throat, And like a red flame a Tongue. Of thirst &amp; of hunger appeard. And a sixth Age passed over: And a state of dismal woe. 12. Enraged &amp; stifled with torment He threw his right Arm to the north His left Arm to the south Shooting out in anguish deep, And his Feet stampd the nether Abyss In trembling &amp; howling &amp; dismay. And a seventh Age passed over: And a state of dismal woe. Chap: V. 1. In terrors Los shrunk from his task: His great hammer fell from his hand: His fires beheld, and sickening, Hid their strong limbs in smoke. For with noises ruinous loud; With hurtlings &amp; clashings &amp; groans The Immortal endur'd his chains, Tho' bound in a deadly sleep. 2. All the myriads of Eternity: All the wisdom &amp; joy of life: Roll like a sea around him, Except what his little orbs Of sight by degrees unfold. 3. And now his eternal life Like a dream was obliterated 4. Shudd'ring, the Eternal Prophet smote With a stroke, from his north to south region The bellows &amp; hammer are silent now A nerveless silence, his prophetic voice Siez'd; a cold solitude &amp; dark void The Eternal Prophet &amp; Urizen clos'd 5. Ages on ages rolld over them Cut off from life &amp; light frozen Into horrible forms of deformity Los suffer'd his fires to decay Then he look'd back with anxious desire But the space undivided by existence Struck horror into his soul. 6. Los wept obscur'd with mourning: His bosom earthquak'd with sighs; He saw Urizen deadly black, In his chains bound, &amp; Pity began, 7. In anguish dividing &amp; dividing For pity divides the soul In pangs eternity on eternity Life in cataracts pourd down his cliffs The void shrunk the lymph into Nerves Wand'ring wide on the bosom of night And left a round globe of blood Trembling upon the Void PLATE 15 Thus the Eternal Prophet was divided Before the death-image of Urizen For in changeable clouds and darkness In a winterly night beneath, The Abyss of Los stretch'd immense: And now seen now obscur'd, to the eyes Of Eternals the visions remote Of the dark seperation appear'd. As glasses discover Worlds In the endless Abyss of space, So the expanding eyes of Immortals Beheld the dark visions of Los, And the globe of life blood trembling. PLATE 18 8. The globe of life blood trembled Branching out into roots; Fibrous, writhing upon the winds; Fibres of blood, milk and tears; In pangs, eternity on eternity. At length in tears &amp; cries imbodied A female form trembling and pale Waves before his deathy face 9. All Eternity shudderd at sight Of the first female now separate Pale as a cloud of snow Waving before the face of Los 10. Wonder, awe, fear, astonishment, Petrify the eternal myriads; At the first female form now separate They call'd her Pity, and fled PLATE 19 11. “Spread a Tent, with strong curtains around them “Let cords &amp; stakes bind in the Void That Eternals may no more behold them” 12. They began to weave curtains of darkness They erected large pillars round the Void With golden hooks fastend in the pillars With infinite labour the Eternals A woof wove, and called it Science Chap: VI. 1. But Los saw the Female &amp; pitied He embrac'd her, she wept, she refus'd In perverse and cruel delight She fled from his arms, yet he followd 2. Eternity shudder'd when they saw, Man begetting his likeness, On his own divided image. 3. A time passed over, the Eternals Began to erect the tent; When Enitharmon, sick, Felt a Worm within her womb. 4. Yet helpless it lay like a Worm In the trembling womb To be moulded into existence 5. All day the worm lay on her bosom All night within her womb The worm lay till it grew to a serpent With dolorous hissings &amp; poisons Round Enitharmons loins folding, 6. Coild within Enitharmons womb The serpent grew casting its scales, With sharp pangs the hissings began To change to a grating cry, Many sorrows and dismal throes Many forms of fish, bird &amp; beast, Brought forth an Infant form Where was a worm before. 7. The Eternals their tent finished Alarm'd with these gloomy visions When Enitharmon groaning Produc'd a man Child to the light. 8. A shriek ran thro' Eternity: And a paralytic stroke; At the birth of the Human shadow. 9. Delving earth in his resistless way; Howling, the Child with fierce flames Issu'd from Enitharmon. 10. The Eternals, closed the tent: They beat down the stakes the cords Stretch'd for a work of eternity; No more Los beheld Eternity. PLATE 20 11. In his hands he siez'd the infant He bathed him in springs of sorrow He gave him to Enitharmon. Chap. VII. 1. They named the child Orc, he grew Fed with milk of Enitharmon 2. Los awoke her; O sorrow &amp; pain! A tight'ning girdle grew, Around his bosom. In sobbings He burst the girdle in twain, But still another girdle Oppressd his bosom, In sobbings Again he burst it. Again Another girdle succeeds The girdle was form'd by day; By night was burst in twain. 3. These falling down on the rock Into an iron Chain In each other link by link lock'd 4. They took Orc to the top of a mountain. O how Enitharmon wept! They chain'd his young limbs to the rock With the Chain of Jealousy Beneath Urizens deathful shadow 5. The dead heard the voice of the child And began to awake from sleep All things. heard the voice of the child And began to awake to life. 6. And Urizen craving with hunger Stung with the odours of Nature Explor'd his dens around 7. He form'd a line &amp; a plummet To divide the Abyss beneath. He form'd a dividing rule: 8. He formed scales to weigh; He formed massy weights; He formed a brazen quadrant; He formed golden compasses And began to explore the Abyss And he planted a garden of fruits 9. But Los encircled Enitharmon With fires of Prophecy From the sight of Urizen &amp; Orc. 10. And she bore an enormous race Chap. VIII. 1. Urizen explor'd his dens Mountain, moor, &amp; wilderness, With a globe of fire lighting his journey A fearful journey, annoy'd By cruel enormities: forms Of life on his forsaken mountains PLATE 23 2. And his world teemd vast enormities Frightning; faithless; fawning Portions of life; similitudes Of a foot, or a hand, or a head Or a heart, or an eye, they swam mischevous Dread terrors! delighting in blood 3. Most Urizen sicken'd to see His eternal creations appear Sons &amp; daughters of sorrow on mountains Weeping! wailing! first Thiriel appear'd Astonish'd at his own existence Like a man from a cloud born, &amp; Utha From the waters emerging, laments! Grodna rent the deep earth howling Amaz'd! his heavens immense cracks Like the ground parch'd with heat; then Fuzon Flam'd out! first begotten, last born. All his eternal sons in like manner His daughters from green herbs &amp; cattle From monsters, &amp; worms of the pit. 4. He in darkness clos'd, view'd all his race And his soul sicken'd! he curs'd Both sons &amp; daughters; for he saw That no flesh nor spirit could keep His iron laws one moment. 5. For he saw that life liv'd upon death The Ox in the slaughter house moans The Dog at the wintry door And he wept, &amp; he called it Pity And his tears flowed down on the winds PLATE 25 6. Cold he wander'd on high, over their cities In weeping &amp; pain &amp; woe! And where-ever he wanderd in sorrows Upon the aged heavens A cold shadow follow'd behind him Like a spiders web, moist, cold, &amp; dim Drawing out from his sorrowing soul The dungeon-like heaven dividing Where ever the footsteps of Urizen Walk'd over the cities in sorrow. 7. Till a Web dark &amp; cold, throughout all The tormented element stretch'd From the sorrows of Urizens soul And the Web is a Female in embrio. None could break the Web, no wings of fire. 8. So twisted the cords, &amp; so knotted The meshes: twisted like to the human brain 9. And all calld it, The Net of Religion. Chap: IX 1. Then the Inhabitants of those Cities: Felt their Nerves change into Marrow And hardening Bones began In swift diseases and torments, In throbbings &amp; shootings &amp; grindings Thro' all the coasts; till weaken'd The Senses inward rush'd shrinking, Beneath the dark net of infection. 2. Till the shrunken eyes clouded over Discernd not the woven hipocrisy But the streaky slime in their heavens Brought together by narrowing perceptions Appeard transparent air; for their eyes Grew small like the eyes of a man And in reptile forms shrinking together Of seven feet stature they remaind 3. Six days they. shrunk up from existence And on the seventh day they rested And they bless'd the seventh day, in sick hope: And forgot their eternal life 4. And their thirty cities divided In form of a human heart No more could they rise at will In the infinite void, but bound down To earth by their narrowing perceptions They lived a period of years Then left a noisom body To the jaws of devouring darkness PLATE 28 5. And their children wept, &amp; built Tombs in the desolate places, And form'd laws of prudence, and call'd them The eternal laws of God 6. And the thirty cities remaind Surrounded by salt floods, now call'd Africa: its name was then Egypt. 7. The remaining sons of Urizen Beheld their brethren shrink together Beneath the Net of Urizen; Perswasion was in vain; For the ears of the inhabitants Were wither'd, &amp; deafen'd, &amp; cold. And their eyes could not discern, Their brethren of other cities. 8. So Fuzon call'd all together The remaining children of Urizen: And they left the pendulous earth: They called it Egypt, &amp; left it. 9. And the salt ocean rolled englob'd The End of the [first] book of Urizen THE BOOK of AHANIA LAMBETH Printed by W Blake 1795 PLATE 2 Chap: I?? 1 Fuzon, on a chariot iron-wing'd On spiked flames rose; his hot visage Flam'd furious! sparkles his hair &amp; beard Shot down his wide bosom and shoulders. On clouds of smoke rages his chariot And his right hand burns red in its cloud Moulding into a vast globe, his wrath As the thunder-stone is moulded. Son of Urizens silent burnings 2 Shall we worship this Demon of smoke, Said Fuzon, this abstract non-entity This cloudy God seated on waters Now seen, now obscur'd; King of sorrow? 3 So he spoke, in a fiery flame, On Urizen frowning indignant, The Globe of wrath shaking on high Roaring with fury, he threw The howling Globe: burning it flew Lengthning into a hungry beam. Swiftly 4 Oppos'd to the exulting flam'd beam The broad Disk of Urizen upheav'd Across the Void many a mile. 5 It was forg'd in mills where the winter Beats incessant; ten winters the disk Unremitting endur'd the cold hammer. 6 But the strong arm that sent it, remember'd The sounding beam; laughing it tore through That beaten mass: keeping its direction The cold loins of Urizen dividing. 7 Dire shriek'd his invisible Lust Deep groan'd Urizen! stretching his awful hand Ahania (so name his parted soul) He siez'd on his mountains of Jealousy. He groand anguishd &amp; called her Sin, Kissing her and weeping over her; Then hid her in darkness in silence; Jealous tho' she was invisible. 8 She fell down a faint shadow wandring In chaos and circling dark Urizen, As the moon anguishd circles the earth; Hopeless! abhorrd! a death-shadow, Unseen, unbodied, unknown, The mother of Pestilence. 9 But the fiery beam of Fuzon Was a pillar of fire to Egypt Five hundred years wandring on earth Till Los siezd it and beat in a mass With the body of the sun. PLATE 3 Chap: II? 1 But the forehead of Urizen gathering, And his eyes pale with anguish, his lips Blue &amp; changing; in tears and bitter Contrition he prepar'd his Bow, 2 Form'd of Ribs: that in his dark solitude When obscur'd in his forests fell monsters, Arose. For his dire Contemplations Rush'd down like floods from his mountains In torrents of mud settling thick With Eggs of unnatural production Forthwith hatching; some howl'd on his hills Some in vales; some aloft flew in air 3 Of these: an enormous dread Serpent Scaled and poisonous horned Approach'd Urizen even to his knees As he sat on his dark rooted Oak. 4 With his horns he push'd furious. Great the conflict &amp; great the jealousy In cold poisons: but Urizen smote him 5 First he poison'd the rocks with his blood Then polish'd his ribs, and his sinews Dried; laid them apart till winter; Then a Bow black prepar'd: on this Bow, A poisoned rock plac'd in silence: He utter'd these words to the Bow: 6 O Bow of the clouds of secresy! O nerve of that lust form'd monster! Send this rock swift, invisible thro' The black clouds, on the bosom of Fuzon 7 So saying, In torment of his wounds, He bent the enormous ribs slowly; A circle of darkness! then fixed The sinew in its rest: then the Rock Poisonous source! plac'd with art, lifting difficult Its weighty bulk: silent the rock lay. 8 While Fuzon his tygers unloosing Thought Urizen slain by his wrath. I am God. said he, eldest of things! 9 Sudden sings the rock, swift &amp; invisible On Fuzon flew, enter'd his bosom; His beautiful visage, his tresses, That gave light to the mornings of heaven Were smitten with darkness, deform'd And outstretch'd on the edge of the forest 10 But the rock fell upon the Earth, Mount Sinai, in Arabia. Chap: III 1 The Globe shook; and Urizen seated On black clouds his sore wound anointed The ointment flow'd down on the void Mix'd with blood; here the snake gets her poison[.] 2 With difficulty &amp; great pain; Urizen Lifted on high the dead corse: On his shoulders he bore it to where A Tree hung over the Immensity 3 For when Urizen shrunk away From Eternals, he sat on a rock Barren; a rock which himself From redounding fancies had petrified[.] Many tears fell on the rock, Many sparks of vegetation; Soon shot the pained root Of Mystery, under his heel: It grew a thick tree; he wrote In silence his book of iron: Till the horrid plant bending its boughs Grew to roots when it felt the earth And again sprung to many a tree. 4 Amaz'd started Urizen! when He beheld himself compassed round And high roofed over with trees He arose but the stems stood so thick He with difficulty and great pain Brought his Books, all but the Book Of iron, from the dismal shade PLATE 4 5 The Tree still grows over the Void Enrooting itself all around An endless labyrinth of woe! 6 The corse of his first begotten On the accursed Tree of Mystery: On the topmost stem of this Tree Urizen nail'd Fuzon's corse. Chap: IV 1 Forth flew the arrows of pestilence Round the pale living Corse on the tree 2 For in Urizens slumbers of abstraction In the infinite ages of Eternity: When his Nerves of Joy melted &amp; flow'd A white Lake on the dark blue air In perturb'd pain and dismal torment Now stretching out, now swift conglobing. 3 Effluvia vapor'd above In noxious clouds; these hover'd thick Over the disorganiz'd Immortal, Till petrific pain scurfd o'er the Lakes As the bones of man, solid &amp; dark 4 The clouds of disease hover'd wide Around the Immortal in torment Perching around the hurtling bones Disease on disease, shape on shape, Winged screaming in blood &amp; torment. 5 The Eternal Prophet beat on his anvils Enrag'd in the desolate darkness He forg'd nets of iron around And Los threw them around the bones 6 The shapes screaming flutter'd vain Some combin'd into muscles &amp; glands Some organs for craving and lust Most remain'd on the tormented void: Urizens army of horrors. 7 Round the pale living Corse on the Tree Forty years flew the arrows of pestilence 8 Wailing and terror and woe Ran thro' all his dismal world: Forty years all his sons &amp; daughters Felt their skulls harden; then Asia Arose in the pendulous deep. 9 They reptilize upon the Earth. 10 Fuzon groand on the Tree. Chap: V 1 The lamenting voice of Ahania Weeping upon the void. And round the Tree of Fuzon: Distant in solitary night Her voice was heard, but no form Had she: but her tears from clouds Eternal fell round the Tree 2 And the voice cried: Ah Urizen! Love! Flower of morning! I weep on the verge Of Non-entity; how wide the Abyss Between Ahania and thee! 3 I lie on the verge of the deep. I see thy dark clouds ascend, I see thy black forests and floods, A horrible waste to my eyes! 4 Weeping I walk over rocks Over dens &amp; thro' valleys of death Why didst thou despise Ahania To cast me from thy bright presence Into the World of Loneness 5 I cannot touch his hand: Nor weep on his knees, nor hear His voice &amp; bow, nor see his eyes And joy, nor hear his footsteps, and My heart leap at the lovely sound! I cannot kiss the place Whereon his bright feet have trod, But I wander on the rocks With hard necessity. PLATE 5 6 Where is my golden palace Where my ivory bed Where the joy of my morning hour Where the sons of eternity, singing 7 To awake bright Urizen, my king! To arise to the mountain sport, To the bliss of eternal valleys: 8 To awake my king in the morn! To embrace Ahanias joy On the bredth of his open bosom: From my soft cloud of dew to fall In showers of life on his harvests. 9 When he gave my happy soul To the sons of eternal joy: When he took the daughters of life. Into my chambers of love: 10 When I found babes of bliss on my beds. And bosoms of milk in my chambers Fill'd with eternal seed O! eternal births sung round Ahania, In interchange sweet of their joys. 11 Swell'd with ripeness &amp; fat with fatness Bursting on winds my odors, My ripe figs and rich pomegranates In infant joy at thy feet O Urizen, sported and sang; 12 Then thou with thy lap full of seed With thy hand full of generous fire Walked forth from the clouds of morning On the virgins of springing joy, On the human soul to cast The seed of eternal science. 13 The sweat poured down thy temples To Ahania return'd in evening The moisture awoke to birth My mothers-joys, sleeping in bliss. 14 But now alone over rocks, mountains Cast out from thy lovely bosom: Cruel jealousy! selfish fear! Self-destroying: how can delight, Renew in these chains of darkness Where bones of beasts are strown On the bleak and snowy mountains Where bones from the birth are buried Before they see the light. FINIS THE BOOK of LOS LAMBETH Printed by W Blake 1795 PLATE 3 Chap. I 1 Eno aged Mother, Who the chariot of Leutha guides, Since the day of thunders in old time 2 Sitting beneath the eternal Oak Trembled and shook the stedfast Earth And thus her speech broke forth. 3 O Times remote! When Love &amp; Joy were adoration: And none impure were deem'd. Not Eyeless Covet Nor Thin-lip'd Envy Nor Bristled Wrath Nor Curled Wantonness 4 But Covet was poured full: Envy fed with fat of lambs: Wrath with lions gore: Wantonness lulld to sleep With the virgins lute, Or sated with her love. 5 Till Covet broke his locks &amp; bars, And slept with open doors: Envy sung at the rich mans feast: Wrath was follow'd up and down By a little ewe lamb And Wantonness on his own true love Begot a giant race: 6 Raging furious the flames of desire Ran thro' heaven &amp; earth, living flames Intelligent, organiz'd: arm'd With destruction &amp; plagues. In the midst The Eternal Prophet bound in a chain Compell'd to watch Urizens shadow 7 Rag'd with curses &amp; sparkles of fury Round the flames roll as Los hurls his chains Mounting up from his fury, condens'd Rolling round &amp; round, mounting on high Into vacuum: into non-entity. Where nothing was! dash'd wide apart His feet stamp the eternal fierce-raging Rivers of wide flame; they roll round And round on all sides making their way Into darkness and shadowy obscurity 8 Wide apart stood the fires: Los remain'd In the void between fire and fire[.] In trembling and horror they beheld him They stood wide apart, driv'n by his hands And his feet which the nether abyss Stamp'd in fury and hot indignation 9 But no light from the fires all was Darkness round Los: heat was not; for bound up Into fiery spheres from his fury The gigantic flames trembled and hid PLATE 4 10 Coldness, darkness, obstruction, a Solid Without fluctuation, hard as adamant Black as marble of Egypt; impenetrable Bound in the fierce raging Immortal. And the seperated fires froze in A vast solid without fluctuation, Bound in his expanding clear senses Chap: II 1 The Immortal stood frozen amidst The vast rock of eternity; times And times; a night of vast durance: Impatient, stifled, stiffend, hardned. 2 Till impatience no longer could bear The hard bondage, rent: rent, the vast solid With a crash from immense to immense 3 Crack'd across into numberless fragments[.] The Prophetic wrath, strug'ling for vent Hurls apart, stamping furious to dust And crumbling with bursting sobs; heaves The black marble on high into fragments 4 Hurl'd apart on all sides, as a falling Rock: the innumerable fragments away Fell asunder; and horrible vacuum Beneath him &amp; on all sides round. 5 Falling, falling! Los fell &amp; fell Sunk precipitant heavy down down Times on times, night on night, day on day Truth has bounds. Error none: falling, falling: Years on years, and ages on ages Still he fell thro' the void, still a void Found for falling day &amp; night without end. For tho' day or night was not; their spaces Were measurd by his incessant whirls In the horrid vacuity bottomless. 6 The Immortal revolving; indignant First in wrath threw his limbs, like the babe New born into our world: wrath subsided And contemplative thoughts first arose Then aloft his head rear'd in the Abyss And his downward-borne fall chang'd oblique 7 Many ages of groans: till there grew Branchy forms: organizing the Human Into finite inflexible organs. 8 Till in process from falling he bore Sidelong on the purple air, wafting The weak breeze in efforts oerwearied 9 Incessant the falling Mind labour'd Organizing itself: till the Vacuum Became element, pliant to rise, Or to fall, or to swim, or to fly: With ease searching the dire vacuity Chap: III 1 The Lungs heave incessant, dull and heavy For as yet were all other parts formless Shiv'ring: clinging around like a cloud Dim &amp; glutinous as the white Polypus Driv'n by waves &amp; englob'd on the tide. 2 And the unformed part crav'd repose Sleep began: the Lungs heave on the wave Weary overweigh'd, sinking beneath In a stifling black fluid he woke 3 He arose on the waters, but soon Heavy falling his organs like roots Shooting out from the seed, shot beneath, And a vast world of waters around him In furious torrents began. 4 Then he sunk, &amp; around his spent Lungs Began intricate pipes that drew in The spawn of the waters. Outbranching An immense Fibrous form, stretching out Thro' the bottoms of immensity raging. PLATE 5 5 He rose on the floods: then he smote The wild deep with his terrible wrath, Seperating the heavy and thin. 6 Down the heavy sunk; cleaving around To the fragments of solid: up rose The thin, flowing round the fierce fires That glow'd furious in the expanse. Chap: IV 1 Then Light first began; from the fires Beams, conducted by fluid so pure Flow'd around the Immense: Los beheld Forthwith, writhing upon the dark void The Back bone of Urizen appear Hurtling upon the wind Like a serpent! like an iron chain Whirling about in the Deep. 2 Upfolding his Fibres together To a Form of impregnable strength Los astonish'd and terrified, built Furnaces; he formed an Anvil A Hammer of adamant then began The binding of Urizen day and night 3 Circling round the dark Demon, with howlings Dismay &amp; sharp blightings; the Prophet Of Eternity beat on his iron links. 4 And first from those infinite fires The light that flow'd down on the winds He siez'd; beating incessant, condensing The subtil particles in an Orb. 5 Roaring indignant the bright sparks Endur'd the vast Hammer; but unwearied Los beat on the Anvil; till glorious An immense Orb of fire he fram'd 6 Oft he quench'd it beneath in the Deeps Then survey'd the all-bright mass. Again Siezing fires from the terrific Orbs He heated the round Globe, then beat[,] While roaring his Furnaces endur'd The chaind Orb in their infinite wombs 7 Nine ages completed their circles When Los heated the glowing mass, casting It down into the Deeps: the Deeps fled Away in redounding smoke; the Sun Stood self-balanc'd. And Los smild with joy. He the vast Spine of Urizen siez'd And bound down to the glowing illusion 8 But no light, for the Deep fled away On all sides, and left an unform'd Dark vacuity: here Urizen lay In fierce torments on his glowing bed 9 Till his Brain in a rock, &amp; his Heart In a fleshy slough formed four rivers Obscuring the immense Orb of fire Flowing down into night: till a Form Was completed, a Human Illusion In darkness and deep clouds involvd. The End of the Book of LOS MILTON a Poem in 2 Books The Author &amp; Printer W Blake 1804 To Justify the Ways of God to Men PLATE 1 Preface. The Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer &amp; Ovid: of Plato &amp; Cicero. which all Men ought to contemn: are set up by artifice against the Sublime of the Bible. but when the New Age is at leisure to Pronounce: all will be set right: &amp; those Grand Works of the more ancient &amp; consciously &amp; professedly Inspired Men, will hold their proper rank, &amp; the Daughters of Memory shall become the Daughters of Inspiration. Shakspeare &amp; Milton were both curbd by the general malady &amp; infection from the silly Greek &amp; Latin slaves of the Sword. Rouze up O Young Men of the New Age! set your foreheads against the ignorant Hirelings! For we have Hirelings in the Camp, the Court &amp; the University: who would if they could, for ever depress Mental &amp; prolong Corporeal War. Painters! on you I call! Sculptors! Architects! Suffer not the fash[i]onable Fools to depress your powers by the prices they pretend to give for contemptible works or the expensive advertizing boasts that they make of such works; believe Christ &amp; his Apostles that there is a Class of Men whose whole delight is in Destroying. We do not want either Greek or Roman Models if we are but just &amp; true to our own Imaginations, those Worlds of Eternity in which we shall live for ever; in Jesus our Lord. And did those feet in ancient time. Walk upon Englands mountains green: And was the holy Lamb of God, On Englands pleasant pastures seen! And did the Countenance Divine, Shine forth upon our clouded hills? And was Jerusalem builded here, Among these dark Satanic Mills? Bring me my Bow of burning gold: Bring me my Arrows of desire: Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold! Bring me my Chariot of fire! I will not cease from Mental Fight, Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand: Till we have built Jerusalem, In Englands green &amp; pleasant Land. Would to God that all the Lords people were Prophets.

To go into the deep her to redeem &amp; himself perish? What cause at length mov'd Milton to this unexampled deed? A Bards prophetic Song! for sitting at eternal tables, Terrific among the Sons of Albion in chorus solemn &amp; loud A Bard broke forth! all sat attentive to the awful man.

Urizen lay in darkness &amp; solitude, in chains of the mind lock'd up Los siezd his Hammer &amp; Tongs; he labourd at his resolute Anvil Among indefinite Druid rocks &amp; snows of doubt &amp; reasoning. Refusing all Definite Form, the Abstract Horror roofd. stony hard And a first Age passed over &amp; a State of dismal woe! Down sunk with fright a red round Globe hot burning. deep Deep down into the Abyss. panting: conglobing: trembling And a second Age passed over &amp; a State of dismal woe. Rolling round into two little Orbs &amp; closed in two little Caves The Eyes beheld the Abyss: lest bones of solidness freeze over all And a third Age passed over &amp; a State of dismal woe. From beneath his Orbs of Vision, Two Ears in close volutions Shot spiring out in the deep darkness &amp; petrified as they grew And a fourth Age passed over &amp; a State of dismal woe. Hanging upon the wind, Two Nostrils bent down into the Deep And a fifth Age passed over &amp; a State of dismal woe. In ghastly torment sick, a Tongue of hunger &amp; thirst flamed out And a sixth Age passed over &amp; a State of dismal woe. Enraged &amp; stifled without &amp; within: in terror &amp; woe, he threw his Right Arm to the north, his left Arm to the south, &amp; his Feet Stampd the nether Abyss in trembling &amp; howling &amp; dismay And a seventh Age passed over &amp; a State of dismal woe Terrified Los stood in the Abyss &amp; his immortal limbs Grew deadly pale; he became what he beheld: for a red Round Globe sunk down from his Bosom into the Deep in pangs He hoverd over it trembling &amp; weeping. suspended it shook The nether Abyss in tremblings. he wept over it, he cherish'd it In deadly sickening pain: till separated into a Female pale As the cloud that brings the snow: all the while from his Back A blue fluid exuded in Sinews hardening in the Abyss Till it separated into a Male Form howling in Jealousy Within labouring. beholding Without: from Particulars to Generals Subduing his Spectre, they Builded the Looms of Generation They Builded Great Golgonooza Times on Times Ages on Ages First Orc was Born then the Shadowy Female: then All Los's Family At last Enitharmon brought forth Satan Refusing Form, in vain The Miller of Eternity made subservient to the Great Harvest That he may go to his own Place Prince of the Starry Wheels PLATE 4 Beneath the Plow of Rintrah &amp; the Harrow of the Almighty In the hands of Palamabron.

If you account it Wisdom when you are angry to be silent, and Not to shew it: I do not account that Wisdom but Folly.

Satan was going to reply, but Los roll'd his loud thunders. Anger me not! thou canst not drive the Harrow in pitys paths. Thy Work is Eternal Death, with Mills &amp; Ovens &amp; Cauldrons. Trouble me no more. thou canst not have Eternal Life So Los spoke! Satan trembling obeyd weeping along the way.

Of the first class was Satan: with incomparable mildness; His primitive tyrannical attempts on Los: with most endearing love He soft intreated Los to give to him Palamabrons station; For Palamabron returnd with labour wearied every evening Palamabron oft refus'd; and as often Satan offer'd His service till by repeated offers and repeated intreaties Los gave to him the Harrow of the Almighty; alas blamable Palamabron. fear'd to be angry lest Satan should accuse him of Ingratitude, &amp; Los believe the accusation thro Satans extreme Mildness. Satan labour'd all day. it was a thousand years In the evening returning terrified overlabourd &amp; astonish'd Embrac'd soft with a brothers tears Palamabron, who also wept Mark well my words! they are of your eternal salvation Next morning Palamabron rose: the horses of the Harrow Were maddend with tormenting fury, &amp; the servants of the Harrow The Gnomes, accus'd Satan, with indignation fury and fire. Then Palamabron reddening like the Moon in an eclipse, Spoke saying, You know Satans mildness and his self-imposition, Seeming a brother, being a tyrant, even thinking himself a brother While he is murdering the just; prophetic I behold His future course thro' darkness and despair to eternal death But we must not be tyrants also! he hath assum'd my place For one whole day, under pretence of pity and love to me: My horses hath he maddend! and my fellow servants injur'd: How should he[,] he[,] know the duties of another? O foolish forbearance Would I had told Los, all my heart! but patience O my friends, All may be well: silent remain, while I call Los and Satan. Loud as the wind of Beulah that unroots the rocks &amp; hills Palamabron call'd! and Los &amp; Satan came before him And Palamabron shew'd the horses &amp; the servants. Satan wept, And mildly cursing Palamabron, him accus'd of crimes Himself had wrought. Los trembled; Satans blandishments almost Perswaded the Prophet of Eternity that Palamabron Was Satans enemy, &amp; that the Gnomes being Palamabron's friends Were leagued together against Satan thro' ancient enmity. What could Los do? how could he judge, when Satans self, believ'd That he had not oppres'd the horses of the Harrow, nor the servants. So Los said, Henceforth Palamabron, let each his own station Keep: nor in pity false, nor in officious brotherhood, where None needs, be active. Mean time Palamabrons horses. Rag'd with thick flames redundant, &amp; the Harrow maddend with fury. Trembling Palamabron stood, the strongest of Demons trembled: Curbing his living creatures; many of the strongest Gnomes, They bit in their wild fury, who also madden'd like wildest beasts Mark well my words; they are of your eternal salvation PLATE 8 Mean while wept Satan before Los, accusing Palamabron; Himself exculpating with mildest speech. for himself believ'd That he had not opress'd nor injur'd the refractory servants. But Satan returning to his Mills (for Palamabron had serv'd The Mills of Satan as the easier task) found all confusion And back return'd to Los, not fill'd with vengeance but with tears, Himself convinc'd of Palamabrons turpitude. Los beheld The servants of the Mills drunken with wine and dancing wild With shouts and Palamabrons songs, rending the forests green With ecchoing confusion, tho' the Sun was risen on high. Then Los took off his left sandal placing it on his head, Signal of solemn mourning: when the servants of the Mills Beheld the signal they in silence stood, tho' drunk with wine. Los wept! But Rintrah also came, and Enitharmon on His arm lean'd tremblingly observing all these things And Los said. Ye Genii of the Mills! the Sun is on high Your labours call you! Palamabron is also in sad dilemma. His horses are mad! his Harrow confounded! his companions enrag'd. Mine is the fault! I should have remember'd that pity divides the soul And man, unmans: follow with me my Plow. this mournful day Must be a blank in Nature: follow with me, and tomorrow again Resume your labours, &amp; this day shall be a mournful day Wildly they follow'd Los and Rintrah, &amp; the Mills were silent They mourn'd all day, this mournful day of Satan &amp; Palamabron: And all the Elect &amp; all the Redeem'd mourn'd one toward another Upon the mountains of Albion among the cliffs of the Dead. They Plow'd in tears! incessant pourd Jehovahs rain, &amp; Molechs Thick fires contending with the rain, thunder'd above rolling Terrible over their heads; Satan wept over Palamabron Theotormon &amp; Bromion contended on the side of Satan Pitying his youth and beauty; trembling at eternal death: Michael contended against Satan in the rolling thunder Thulloh the friend of Satan also reprovd him; faint their reproof. But Rintrah who is of the reprobate: of those form'd to destruction In indignation. for Satans soft dissimulation of friendship! Flam'd above all the plowed furrows, angry red and furious, Till Michael sat down in the furrow weary dissolv'd in tears[.] Satan who drave the team beside him, stood angry &amp; red He smote Thulloh &amp; slew him, &amp; he stood terrible over Michael Urging him to arise: he wept! Enitharmon saw his tears But Los hid Thulloh from her sight, lest she should die of grief She wept: she trembled! she kissed Satan; she wept over Michael She form'd a Space for Satan &amp; Michael &amp; for the poor infected[.] Trembling she wept over the Space, &amp; clos'd it with a tender Moon Los secret buried Thulloh, weeping disconsolate over the moony Space But Palamabron called down a Great Solemn Assembly, That he who will not defend Truth, may be compelled to Defend a Lie, that he may be snared &amp; caught &amp; taken PLATE 9 And all Eden descended into Palamabrons tent Among Albions Druids &amp; Bards, in the caves beneath Albions Death Couch, in the caverns of death, in the corner of the Atlantic. And in the midst of the Great Assembly Palamabron pray'd: O God, protect me from my friends, that they have not power over me Thou hast giv'n me power to protect myself from my bitterest enemies. Mark well my words, they are of your eternal salvation Then rose the Two Witnesses, Rintrah &amp; Palamabron: And Palamabron appeal'd to all Eden, and recievd Judgment: and Lo! it fell on Rintrah and his rage: Which now flam'd high &amp; furious in Satan against Palamabron Till it became a proverb in Eden. Satan is among the Reprobate. Los in his wrath curs'd heaven &amp; earth, he rent up Nations, Standing on Albions rocks among high-reard Druid temples Which reach the stars of heaven &amp; stretch from pole to pole. He displacd continents, the oceans fled before his face He alter'd the poles of the world, east, west &amp; north &amp; south But he clos'd up Enitharmon from the sight of all these things For Satan flaming with Rintrahs fury hidden beneath his own mildness Accus'd Palamabron before the Assembly of ingratitude! of malice: He created Seven deadly Sins drawing out his infernal scroll, Of Moral laws and cruel punishments upon the clouds of Jehovah To pervert the Divine voice in its entrance to the earth With thunder of war &amp; trumpets sound, with armies of disease Punishments &amp; deaths musterd &amp; number'd; Saying I am God alone There is no other! let all obey my principles of moral individuality I have brought them from the uppermost innermost recesses Of my Eternal Mind, transgressors I will rend off for ever, As now I rend this accursed Family from my covering. Thus Satan rag'd amidst the Assembly! and his bosom grew Opake against the Divine Vision: the paved terraces of His bosom inwards shone with fires, but the stones becoming opake! Hid him from sight, in an extreme blackness and darkness, And there a World of deeper Ulro was open'd, in the midst Of the Assembly. In Satans bosom a vast unfathomable Abyss. Astonishment held the Assembly in an awful silence: and tears Fell down as dews of night, &amp; a loud solemn universal groan Was utter'd from the east &amp; from the west &amp; from the south And from the north; and Satan stood opake immeasurable Covering the east with solid blackness, round his hidden heart, With thunders utterd from his hidden wheels: accusing loud The Divine Mercy, for protecting Palamabron in his tent. Rintrah rear'd up walls of rocks and pourd rivers &amp; moats Of fire round the walls: columns of fire guard around Between Satan and Palamabron in the terrible darkness. And Satan not having the Science of Wrath, but only of Pity: Rent them asunder, and wrath was left to wrath, &amp; pity to pity. He sunk down a dreadful Death, unlike the slumbers of Beulah The Separation was terrible: the Dead was repos'd on his Couch Beneath the Couch of Albion, on the seven mou[n]tains of Rome In the whole place of the Covering Cherub, Rome Babylon &amp; Tyre. His Spectre raging furious descended into its Space PLATE 10 Then Los &amp; Enitharmon knew that Satan is Urizen Drawn down by Orc &amp; the Shadowy Female into Generation Oft Enitharmon enterd weeping into the Space, there appearing An aged Woman raving along the Streets (the Space is named Canaan) then she returnd to Los weary frighted as from dreams The nature of a Female Space is this: it shrinks the Organs Of Life till they become Finite &amp; Itself seems Infinite And Satan vibrated in the immensity of the Space! Limited To those without but Infinite to those within: it fell down and Became Canaan: closing Los from Eternity in Albions Cliffs A mighty Fiend against the Divine Humanity mustring to War Satan! Ah me! is gone to his own place, said Los! their God I will not worship in their Churches, nor King in their Theatres Elynittria! whence is this Jealousy running along the mountains British Women were not Jealous when Greek &amp; Roman were Jealous Every thing in Eternity shines by its own Internal light: but thou Darkenest every Internal light with the arrows of thy quiver Bound up in the horns of Jealousy to a deadly fading Moon And Ocalythron binds the Sun into a Jealous Globe That every thing is fixd Opake without Internal light So Los lamented over Satan, who triumphant divided the Nations PLATE 11 He set his face against Jerusalem to destroy the Eon of Albion But Los hid Enitharmon from the sight of all these things, Upon the Thames whose lulling harmony repos'd her soul: Where Beulah lovely terminates in rocky Albion: Terminating in Hyde Park, on Tyburns awful brook. And the Mills of Satan were separated into a moony Space Among the rocks of Albions Temples, and Satans Druid sons Offer the Human Victims throughout all the Earth, and Albions Dread Tomb immortal on his Rock, overshadowd the whole Earth: Where Satan making to himself Laws from his own identity. Compell'd others to serve him in moral gratitude &amp; submission Being call'd God: setting himself above all that is called God. And all the Spectres of the Dead calling themselves Sons of God In his Synagogues worship Satan under the Unutterable Name And it was enquir'd: Why in a Great Solemn Assembly The Innocent should be condemn'd for the Guilty? Then an Eternal rose Saying. If the Guilty should be condemn'd, he must be an Eternal Death And one must die for another throughout all Eternity. Satan is fall'n from his station &amp; never can be redeem'd But must be new Created continually moment by moment And therefore the Class of Satan shall be calld the Elect, &amp; those Of Rintrah. the Reprobate, &amp; those of Palamabron the Redeem'd For he is redeem'd from Satans Law, the wrath falling on Rintrah, And therefore Palamabron dared not to call a solemn Assembly Till Satan had assum'd Rintrahs wrath in the day of mourning In a feminine delusion of false pride self-deciev'd. So spake the Eternal and confirm'd it with a thunderous oath. But when Leutha (a Daughter of Beulah) beheld Satans condemnation She down descended into the midst of the Great Solemn Assembly Offering herself a Ransom for Satan, taking on her, his Sin. Mark well my words. they are of your eternal salvation! And Leutha stood glowing with varying colours immortal, heart-piercing And lovely: &amp; her moth-like elegance shone over the Assembly At length standing upon the golden floor of Palamabron She spake: I am the Author of this Sin! by my suggestion My Parent power Satan has committed this transgression. I loved Palamabron &amp; I sought to approach his Tent, But beautiful Elynittria with her silver arrows repelld me. PLATE 12 For her light is terrible to me. I fade before her immortal beauty. O wherefore doth a Dragon-form forth issue from my limbs To sieze her new born son? Ah me! the wretched Leutha! This to prevent, entering the doors of Satans brain night after night Like sweet perfumes I stupified the masculine perceptions And kept only the feminine awake. hence rose his soft Delusory love to Palamabron: admiration join'd with envy Cupidity unconquerable! my fault, when at noon of day The Horses of Palamabron call'd for rest and pleasant death: I sprang out of the breast of Satan, over the Harrow beaming In all my beauty! that I might unloose the flaming steeds As Elynittria use'd to do; but too well those living creatures Knew that I was not Elynittria, and they brake the traces[.] But me, the servants of the Harrow saw not: but as a bow Of varying colours on the hills; terribly rag'd the horses. Satan astonishd, and with power above his own controll Compell'd the Gnomes to curb the horses, &amp; to throw banks of sand Around the fiery flaming Harrow in labyrinthine forms. And brooks between to intersect the meadows in their course. The Harrow cast thick flames: Jehovah thunderd above: Chaos &amp; ancient night fled from beneath the fiery Harrow: The Harrow cast thick flames &amp; orb'd us round in concave fires A Hell of our own making. see, its flames still gird me round[.] Jehovah thunder'd above! Satan in pride of heart Drove the fierce Harrow among the constellations of Jehovah Drawing a third part in the fires as stubble north &amp; south To devour Albion and Jerusalem the Emanation of Albion Driving the Harrow in Pitys paths. 'twas then, with our dark fires Which now gird round us (O eternal torment) I form'd the Serpent Of precious stones &amp; gold turn'd poisons on the sultry wastes The Gnomes in all that day spar'd not; they curs'd Satan bitterly. To do unkind things in kindness! with power armd, to say The most irritating things in the midst of tears and love These are the stings of the Serpent! thus did we by them; till thus They in return retaliated, and the Living Creatures maddend. The Gnomes labourd. I weeping hid in Satans inmost brain; But when the Gnomes refus'd to labour more, with blandishments I came forth from the head of Satan! back the Gnomes recoil'd. And call'd me Sin, and for a sign portentous held me. Soon Day sunk and Palamabron return'd, trembling I hid myself In Satans inmost Palace of his nervous fine wrought Brain: For Elynittria met Satan with all her singing women. Terrific in their joy &amp; pouring wine of wildest power They gave Satan their wine: indignant at the burning wrath. Wild with prophetic fury his former life became like a dream Cloth'd in the Serpents folds, in selfish holiness demanding purity Being most impure, self-condemn'd to eternal tears, he drove Me from his inmost Brain &amp; the doors clos'd with thunders sound O Divine Vision who didst create the Female: to repose The Sleepers of Beulah: pity the repentant Leutha. My PLATE 13 Sick Couch bears the dark shades of Eternal Death infolding The Spectre of Satan. he furious refuses to repose in sleep. I humbly bow in all my Sin before the Throne Divine. Not so the Sick-one; Alas what shall be done him to restore? Who calls the Individual Law, Holy: and despises the Saviour. Glorying to involve Albions Body in fires of eternal War— Now Leutha ceas'd: tears flow'd: but the Divine Pity supported her. All is my fault! We are the Spectre of Luvah the murderer Of Albion: O Vala! O Luvah! O Albion! O lovely Jerusalem The Sin was begun in Eternity, and will not rest to Eternity Till two Eternitys meet together, Ah! lost! lost! lost! for ever! So Leutha spoke. But when she saw that Enitharmon had Created a New Space to protect Satan from punishment; She fled to Enitharmons Tent &amp; hid herself. Loud raging Thunderd the Assembly dark &amp; clouded, and they ratify'd The kind decision of Enitharmon &amp; gave a Time to the Space, Even Six Thousand years; and sent Lucifer for its Guard. But Lucifer refus'd to die &amp; in pride he forsook his charge And they elected Molech, and when Molech was impatient The Divine hand found the Two Limits: first of Opacity, then of Contraction Opacity was named Satan, Contraction was named Adam. Triple Elohim came: Elohim wearied fainted: they elected Shaddai. Shaddai angry, Pahad descended: Pahad terrified, they sent Jehovah And Jehovah was leprous; loud he call'd, stretching his hand to Eternity For then the Body of Death was perfected in hypocritic holiness, Around the Lamb, a Female Tabernacle woven in Cathedrons Looms He died as a Reprobate. he was Punish'd as a Transgressor! Glory! Glory! Glory! to the Holy Lamb of God I touch the heavens as an instrument to glorify the Lord! The Elect shall meet the Redeem'd. on Albions rocks they shall meet Astonish'd at the Transgressor, in him beholding the Saviour. And the Elect shall say to the Redeemd. We behold it is of Divine Mercy alone! of Free Gift and Election that we live. Our Virtues &amp; Cruel Goodnesses, have deserv'd Eternal Death. Thus they weep upon the fatal Brook of Albions River. But Elynittria met Leutha in the place where she was hidden. And threw aside her arrows, and laid down her sounding Bow; She sooth'd her with soft words &amp; brought her to Palamabrons bed In moments new created for delusion, interwoven round about, In dreams she bore the shadowy Spectre of Sleep, &amp; namd him Death. In dreams she bore Rahab the mother of Tirzah &amp; her sisters In Lambeths vales; in Cambridge &amp; in Oxford, places of Thought Intricate labyrinths of Times and Spaces unknown, that Leutha lived In Palamabrons Tent, and Oothoon was her charming guard. The Bard ceas'd. All consider'd and a loud resounding murmur Continu'd round the Halls; and much they questiond the immortal Loud voicd Bard. and many condemn'd the high tone'd Song Saying Pity and Love are too venerable for the imputation Of Guilt. Others said. If it is true! if the acts have been perform'd Let the Bard himself witness. Where hadst thou this terrible Song The Bard replied. I am Inspired! I know it is Truth! for I Sing PLATE 14 According to the inspiration of the Poetic Genius Who is the eternal all-protecting Divine Humanity To whom be Glory &amp; Power &amp; Dominion Evermore Amen Then there was great murmuring in the Heavens of Albion Concerning Generation &amp; the Vegetative power &amp; concerning The Lamb the Saviour: Albion trembled to Italy Greece &amp; Egypt To Tartary &amp; Hindostan &amp; China &amp; to Great America Shaking the roots &amp; fast foundations of the Earth in doubtfulness The loud voic'd Bard terrify'd took refuge in Miltons bosom Then Milton rose up from the heavens of Albion ardorous! The whole Assembly wept prophetic, seeing in Miltons face And in his lineaments divine the shades of Death &amp; Ulro He took off the robe of the promise, &amp; ungirded himself from the oath of God And Milton said, I go to Eternal Death! The Nations still Follow after the detestable Gods of Priam; in pomp Of warlike selfhood, contradicting and blaspheming. When will the Resurrection come; to deliver the sleeping body From corruptibility: O when Lord Jesus wilt thou come? Tarry no longer; for my soul lies at the gates of death. I will arise and look forth for the morning of the grave. I will go down to the sepulcher to see if morning breaks! I will go down to self annihilation and eternal death, Lest the Last Judgment come &amp; find me unannihilate And I be siez'd &amp; giv'n into the hands of my own Selfhood. The Lamb of God is seen thro' mists &amp; shadows, hov'ring Over the sepulchers in clouds of Jehovah &amp; winds of Elohim A disk of blood, distant; &amp; heav'ns &amp; earth's roll dark between What do I here before thè Judgment? without my Emanation? With the daughters of memory, &amp; not with the daughters of inspiration[?] I in my Selfhood am that Satan: I am that Evil One! He is my Spectre! in my obedience to loose him from my Hells To claim the Hells, my Furnaces, I go to Eternal Death. And Milton said. I go to Eternal Death! Eternity shudder'd For he took the outside course, among the graves of the dead A mournful shade. Eternity shudderd at the image of eternal death Then on the verge of Beulah he beheld his own Shadow; A mournful form double; hermaphroditic: male &amp; female In one wonderful body. and he enterd into it In direful pain for the dread shadow, twenty-seven-fold Reachd to the depths of dirast Hell, &amp; thence to Albions land: Which is this earth of vegetation on which now I write. The Seven Angels of the Presence wept over Miltons Shadow! PLATE 15 As when a man dreams, he reflects not that his body sleeps, Else he would wake; so seem'd he entering his Shadow: but With him the Spirits of the Seven Angels of the Presence Entering; they gave him still perceptions of his Sleeping Body; Which now arose and walk'd with them in Eden, as an Eighth Image Divine tho' darken'd; and tho walking as one walks In sleep; and the Seven comforted and supported him. Like as a Polypus that vegetates beneath the deep! They saw his Shadow vegetated underneath the Couch Of death: for when he enterd into his Shadow: Himself: His real and immortal Self: was as appeard to those Who dwell in immortality, as One sleeping on a couch Of gold; and those in immortality gave forth their Emanations Like Females of sweet beauty, to guard round him &amp; to feed His lips with food of Eden in his cold and dim repose! But to himself he seemd a wanderer lost in dreary night. Onwards his Shadow kept its course among the Spectres; call'd Satan, but swift as lightning passing them, startled the shades Of Hell beheld him in a trail of light as of a comet That travels into Chaos: so Milton went guarded within. The nature of infinity is this: That every thing has its Own Vortex; and when once a traveller thro' Eternity Has passd that Vortex, he percieves it roll backward behind His path, into a globe itself infolding; like a sun: Or like a moon, or like a universe of starry majesty, While he keeps onwards in his wondrous journey on the earth Or like a human form, a friend with whom he livd benevolent. As the eye of man views both the east &amp; west encompassing Its vortex; and the north &amp; south, with all their starry host; Also the rising sun &amp; setting moon he views surrounding His corn-fields and his valleys of five hundred acres square. Thus is the earth one infinite plane, and not as apparent To the weak traveller confin'd beneath the moony shade. Thus is the heaven a vortex passd already, and the earth A vortex not yet pass'd by the traveller thro' Eternity. First Milton saw Albion upon the Rock of Ages, Deadly pale outstretchd and snowy cold, storm coverd; A Giant form of perfect beauty outstretchd on the rock In solemn death: the Sea of Time &amp; Space thunderd aloud Against the rock, which was inwrapped with the weeds of death Hovering over the cold bosom, in its vortex Milton bent down To the bosom of death, what was underneath soon seemd above. A cloudy heaven mingled with stormy seas in loudest ruin; But as a wintry globe descends precipitant thro' Beulah bursting, With thunders loud, and terrible: so Miltons shadow fell, Precipitant loud thundring into the Sea of Time &amp; Space. Then first I saw him in the Zenith as a falling star, Descending perpendicular, swift as the swallow or swift; And on my left foot falling on the tarsus, enterd there; But from my left foot a black cloud redounding spread over Europe. Then Milton knew that the Three Heavens of Beulah were beheld By him on earth in his bright pilgrimage of sixty years PLATE 16 [Full-page design.], PLATE 17 In those three females whom his Wives, &amp; those three whom his Daughters Had represented and containd, that they might be resum'd By giving up of Selfhood: &amp; they distant view'd his journey In their eternal spheres, now Human, tho' their Bodies remain clos'd In the dark Ulro till the Judgment: also Milton knew: they and Himself was Human, tho' now wandering thro Death's Vale In conflict with those Female forms, which in blood &amp; jealousy Surrounded him, dividing &amp; uniting without end or number. He saw the Cruelties of Ulro, and he wrote them down In iron tablets: and his Wives &amp; Daughters names were these Rahab and Tirzah, &amp; Milcah &amp; Malah &amp; Noah &amp; Hoglah. They sat rang'd round him as the rocks of Horeb round the land Of Canaan: and they wrote in thunder smoke and fire His dictate; and his body was the Rock Sinai; that body, Which was on earth born to corruption: &amp; the six Females Are Hor &amp; Peor &amp; Bashan &amp; Abarim &amp; Lebanon &amp; Hermon Seven rocky masses terrible in the Desarts of Midian. But Miltons Human Shadow continu'd journeying above The rocky masses of The Mundane Shell; in the Lands Of Edom &amp; Aram &amp; Moab &amp; Midian &amp; Amalek. The Mundane Shell, is a vast Concave Earth: an immense Hardend shadow of all things upon our Vegetated Earth Enlarg'd into dimension &amp; deform'd into indefinite space, In Twenty-seven Heavens and all their Hells; with Chaos And Ancient Night; &amp; Purgatory. It is a cavernous Earth Of labyrinthine intricacy, twenty-seven folds of opakeness And finishes where the lark mounts; here Milton journeyed In that Region call'd Midian, among the Rocks of Horeb[.] For travellers from Eternity. pass outward to Satan's seat, But travellers to Eternity. pass inward to Golgonooza. Los the Vehicular terror beheld him, &amp; divine Enitharmon Call'd all her daughters, Saying. Surely to unloose my bond Is this Man come! Satan shall be unloosd upon Albion Los heard in terror Enitharmons words: in fibrous strength His limbs shot forth like roots of trees against the forward path Of Miltons journey. Urizen beheld the immortal Man, PLATE 18 And Tharmas Demon of the Waters, &amp; Orc, who is Luvah The Shadowy Female seeing Milton, howl'd in her lamentation Over the Deeps outstretching her Twenty seven Heavens over Albion And thus the Shadowy Female howls in articulate howlings I will lament over Milton in the lamentations of the afflicted My Garments shall be woven of sighs &amp; heart broken lamentations The misery of unhappy Families shall be drawn out into its border Wrought with the needle with dire sufferings poverty pain &amp; woe Along the rocky Island &amp; thence throughout the whole Earth There shall be the sick Father &amp; his starving Family! there The Prisoner in the stone Dungeon &amp; the Slave at the Mill I will have Writings written all over it in Human Words That every Infant that is born upon the Earth shall read And get by rote as a hard task of a life of sixty years I will have Kings inwoven upon it &amp; Councellors &amp; Mighty Men The Famine shall clasp it together with buckles &amp; Clasps And the Pestilence shall be its fringe &amp; the War its girdle To divide into Rahab &amp; Tirzah that Milton may come to our tents For I will put on the Human Form &amp; take the Image of God Even Pity &amp; Humanity but my Clothing shall be Cruelty And I will put on Holiness as a breastplate &amp; as a helmet And all my ornaments shall be of the gold of broken hearts And the precious stones of anxiety &amp; care &amp; desperation &amp; death And repentance for sin &amp; sorrow &amp; punishment &amp; fear To defend me from thy terrors O Orc! my only beloved! Orc answerd. Take not the Human Form O loveliest. Take not Terror upon thee! Behold how I am &amp; tremble lest thou also Consume in my Consummation; but thou maist take a Form Female &amp; lovely, that cannot consume in Mans consummation Wherefore dost thou Create &amp; Weave this Satan for a Covering[?] When thou attemptest to put on the Human Form, my wrath Burns to the top of heaven against thee in Jealousy &amp; Fear. Then I rend thee asunder, then I howl over thy clay &amp; ashes When wilt thou put on the Female Form as in times of old With a Garment of Pity &amp; Compassion like the Garment of God His garments are long sufferings for the Children of Men Jerusalem is his Garment &amp; not thy Covering Cherub O lovely Shadow of my delight who wanderest seeking for the prey. So spoke Orc when Oothoon &amp; Leutha hoverd over his Couch Of fire in interchange of Beauty &amp; Perfection in the darkness Opening interiorly into Jerusalem &amp; Babylon shining glorious In the Shadowy Females bosom. Jealous her darkness grew: Howlings filld all the desolate places in accusations of Sin In Female beauty shining in the unformd void &amp; Orc in vain Stretch'd out his hands of fire, &amp; wooed: they triumph in his pain Thus darkend the Shadowy Female tenfold &amp; Orc tenfold Glowd on his rocky Couch against the darkness: loud thunders Told of the enormous conflict[.] Earthquake beneath: around; Rent the Immortal Females, limb from limb &amp; joint from joint And moved the fast foundations of the Earth to wake the Dead Urizen emerged from his Rocky Form &amp; from his Snows, PLATE 19 And he also darkend his brows: freezing dark rocks between The footsteps. and infixing deep the feet in marble beds: That Milton labourd with his journey, &amp; his feet bled sore Upon the clay now changd to marble; also Urizen rose, And met him on the shores of Arnon; &amp; by the streams of the brooks Silent they met, and silent strove among the streams, of Arnon Even to Mahanaim, when with cold hand Urizen stoop'd down And took up water from the river Jordan: pouring on To Miltons brain the icy fluid from his broad cold palm. But Milton took of the red clay of Succoth, moulding it with care Between his palms; and filling up the furrows of many years Beginning at the feet of Urizen, and on the bones Creating new flesh on the Demon cold, and building him, As with new clay a Human form in the Valley of Beth Peor. Four Universes round the Mundane Egg remain Chaotic One to the North, named Urthona: One to the South, named Urizen: One to the East, named Luvah: One to the West, named Tharmas They are the Four Zoa's that stood around the Throne Divine! But when Luvah assum'd the World of Urizen to the South: And Albion was slain upon his mountains, &amp; in his tent; All fell towards the Center in dire ruin, sinking down. And in the South remains a burning fire; in the East a void. In the West, a world of raging waters; in the North a solid, Unfathomable! without end. But in the midst of these, Is built eternally the Universe of Los and Enitharmon: Towards which Milton went, but Urizen oppos'd his path. The Man and Demon strove many periods. Rahab beheld Standing on Carmel; Rahab and Tirzah trembled to behold The enormous strife. one giving life, the other giving death To his adversary. and they sent forth all their sons &amp; daughters In all their beauty to entice Milton across the river, The Twofold form Hermaphroditic: and the Double-sexed; The Female-male &amp; the Male-female, self-dividing stood Before him in their beauty, &amp; in cruelties of holiness! Shining in darkness, glorious upon the deeps of Entuthon. Saying. Come thou to Ephraim! behold the Kings of Canaan! The beautiful Amalekites, behold the fires of youth Bound with the Chain of Jealousy by Los &amp; Enitharmon; The banks of Cam: cold learnings streams: Londons dark-frowning towers, Lament upon the winds of Europe in Rephaims Vale. Because Ahania rent apart into a desolate night, Laments! &amp; Enion wanders like a weeping inarticulate voice And Vala labours for her bread &amp; water among the Furnaces Therefore bright Tirzah triumphs: putting on all beauty. And all perfection, in her cruel sports among the Victims, Come bring with thee Jerusalem with songs on the Grecian Lyre! In Natural Religion! in experiments on Men, Let her be Offerd up to Holiness! Tirzah numbers her; She numbers with her fingers every fibre ere it grow; Where is the Lamb of God? where is the promise of his coming? Her shadowy Sisters form the bones, even the bones of Horeb: Around the marrow! and the orbed scull around the brain! His Images are born for War! for Sacrifice to Tirzah! To Natural Religion! to Tirzah the Daughter of Rahab the Holy! She ties the knot of nervous fibres, into a white brain! She ties the knot of bloody veins, into a red hot heart! Within her bosom Albion lies embalmd, never to awake Hand is become a rock! Sinai &amp; Horeb, is Hyle &amp; Coban: Scofield is bound in iron armour before Reubens Gate! She ties the knot of milky seed into two lovely Heavens PLATE 20 Two yet but one: each in the other sweet reflected! these Are our Three Heavens beneath the shades of Beulah, land of rest! Come then to Ephraim &amp; Manasseh O beloved-one! Come to my ivory palaces O beloved of thy mother! And let us bind thee in the bands of War &amp; be thou King Of Canaan and reign in Hazor where the Twelve Tribes meet. So spoke they as in one voice! Silent Milton stood before The darkend Urizen; as the sculptor silent stands before His forming image; he walks round it patient labouring. Thus Milton stood forming bright Urizen, while his Mortal part Sat frozen in the rock of Horeb: and his Redeemed portion, Thus form'd the Clay of Urizen; but within that portion His real Human walkd above in power and majesty Tho darkend; and the Seven Angels of the Presence attended him. O how can I with my gross tongue that cleaveth to the dust, Tell of the Four-fold Man, in starry numbers fitly orderd Or how can I with my cold hand of clay! But thou O Lord Do with me as thou wilt! for I am nothing, and vanity. If thou chuse to elect a worm, it shall remove the mountains. For that portion namd the Elect: the Spectrous body of Milton: Redounding from my left foot into Los's Mundane space, Brooded over his Body in Horeb against the Resurrection Preparing it for the Great Consummation; red the Cherub on Sinai Glow'd; but in terrors folded round his clouds of blood. Now Albions sleeping Humanity began to turn upon his Couch; Feeling the electric flame of Miltons awful precipitate descent. Seest thou the little winged fly, smaller than a grain of sand? It has a heart like thee; a brain open to heaven &amp; hell, Withinside wondrous &amp; expansive; its gates are not clos'd, I hope thine are not: hence it clothes itself in rich array; Hence thou art cloth'd with human beauty O thou mortal man. Seek not thy heavenly father then beyond the skies: There Chaos dwells &amp; ancient Night &amp; Og &amp; Anak old: For every human heart has gates of brass &amp; bars of adamant, Which few dare unbar because dread Og &amp; Anak guard the gates Terrific! and each mortal brain is walld and moated round Within: and Og &amp; Anak watch here; here is the Seat Of Satan in its Webs; for in brain and heart and loins Gates open behind Satans Seat to the City of Golgonooza Which is the spiritual fourfold London, in the loins of Albion. Thus Milton fell thro Albions heart, travelling outside of Humanity Beyond the Stars in Chaos in Caverns of the Mundane Shell. But many of the Eternals rose up from eternal tables Drunk with the Spirit, burning round the Couch of death they stood Looking down into Beulah: wrathful, fill'd with rage! They rend the heavens round the Watchers in a fiery circle: And round the Shadowy Eighth: the Eight close up the Couch Into a tabernacle, and flee with cries down to the Deeps: Where Los opens his three wide gates, surrounded by raging fires! They soon find their own place &amp; join the Watchers of the Ulro. Los saw them and a cold pale horror coverd o'er his limbs Pondering he knew that Rintrah &amp; Palamabron might depart: Even as Reuben &amp; as Gad; gave up himself to tears. He sat down on his anvil-stock; and leand upon the trough. Looking into the black water, mingling it with tears. At last when desperation almost tore his heart in twain He recollected an old Prophecy in Eden recorded, And often sung to the loud harp at the immortal feasts That Milton of the Land of Albion should up ascend Forwards from Ulro from the Vale of Felpham; and set free Orc from his Chain of Jealousy, he started at the thought PLATE 21 And down descended into Udan-Adan; it was night: And Satan sat sleeping upon his Couch in Udan-Adan: His Spectre slept, his Shadow woke; when one sleeps th'other wakes. But Milton entering my Foot; I saw in the nether Regions of the Imagination; also all men on Earth, And all in Heaven, saw in the nether regions of the Imagination In Ulro beneath Beulah, the vast breach of Miltons descent. But I knew not that it was Milton, for man cannot know What passes in his members till periods of Space &amp; Time Reveal the secrets of Eternity: for more extensive Than any other earthly things, are Mans earthly lineaments. And all this Vegetable World appeard on my left Foot, As a bright sandal formd immortal of precious stones &amp; gold: I stooped down &amp; bound it on to walk forward thro' Eternity. There is in Eden a sweet River, of milk &amp; liquid pearl. Namd Ololon; on whose mild banks dwelt those who Milton drove Down into Ulro: and they wept in long resounding song For seven days of eternity, and the rivers living banks The mountains wail'd! &amp; every plant that grew, in solemn sighs lamented. When Luvahs bulls each morning drag the sulphur Sun out of the Deep Harnessd with starry harness black &amp; shining kept by black slaves That work all night at the starry harness, Strong and vigorous They drag the unwilling Orb: at this time all the Family Of Eden heard the lamentation, and Providence began. But when the clarions of day sounded they drownd the lamentations And when night came all was silent in Ololon: &amp; all refusd to lament In the still night fearing lest they should others molest. Seven mornings Los heard them, as the poor bird within the shell Hears its impatient parent bird; and Enitharmon heard them: But saw them not, for the blue Mundane Shell inclos'd them in. And they lamented that they had in wrath &amp; fury &amp; fire Driven Milton into the Ulro; for now they knew too late That it was Milton the Awakener: they had not heard the Bard, Whose song calld Milton to the attempt; and Los heard these laments. He heard them call in prayer all the Divine Family; And he beheld the Cloud of Milton stretching over Europe. But all the Family Divine collected as Four Suns In the Four Points of heaven East, West &amp; North &amp; South, Enlarging and enlarging till their Disks approachd each other; And when they touch'd closed together Southward in One Sun Over Ololon: and as One Man, who weeps over his brother, In a dark tomb, so all the Family Divine. wept over Ololon. Saying. Milton goes to Eternal Death! so saying, they groan'd in spirit And were troubled! and again the Divine Family groaned in spirit! And Ololon said, Let us descend also, and let us give Ourselves to death in Ulro among the Transgressors. Is Virtue a Punisher? O no! how is this wondrous thing: This World beneath, unseen before: this refuge from the wars Of Great Eternity! unnatural refuge! unknown by us till now! Or are these the pangs of repentance? let us enter into them Then the Divine Family said. Six Thousand Years are now Accomplish'd in this World of Sorrow; Miltons Angel knew The Universal Dictate; and you also feel this Dictate. And now you know this World of Sorrow, and feel Pity. Obey The Dictate! Watch over this World, and with your brooding wings, Renew it to Eternal Life: Lo! I am with you alway But you cannot renew Milton he goes to Eternal Death So spake the Family Divine as One Man even Jesus Uniting in One with Ololon &amp; the appearance of One Man. Jesus the Saviour appeard coming in the Clouds of Ololon! PLATE 22 Tho driven away with the Seven Starry Ones into the Ulro Yet the Divine Vision remains Every-where For-ever. Amen. And Ololon lamented for Milton with a great lamentation. While Los heard indistinct in fear, what time I bound my sandals On; to walk forward thro' Eternity, Los descended to me: And Los behind me stood; a terrible flaming Sun: just close Behind my back; I turned round in terror, and behold. Los stood in that fierce glowing fire; &amp; he also stoop'd down And bound my sandals on in Udan-Adan; trembling I stood Exceedingly with fear &amp; terror, standing in the Vale Of Lambeth: but he kissed me, and wishd me health. And I became One Man with him arising in my strength: Twas too late now to recede. Los had enterd into my soul: His terrors now posses'd me whole! I arose in fury &amp; strength. I am that Shadowy Prophet who Six Thousand Years ago Fell from my station in the Eternal bosom. Six Thousand Years Are finishd. I return! both Time &amp; Space obey my will. I in Six Thousand Years walk up and down: for not one Moment Of Time is lost, nor one Event of Space unpermanent. But all remain: every fabric of Six Thousand Years Remains permanent: tho' on the Earth where Satan Fell, and was cut off all things vanish &amp; are seen no more They vanish not from me &amp; mine, we guard them first &amp; last[.] The generations of men run on in the tide of Time But leave their destind lineaments permanent for ever &amp; ever. So spoke Los as we went along to his supreme abode Rintrah and Palamabron met us at the Gate of Golgonooza Clouded with discontent. &amp; brooding in their minds terrible things They said. O Father most beloved! O merciful Parent! Pitying and permitting evil, tho strong &amp; mighty to destroy. Whence is this Shadow terrible? wherefore dost thou refuse To throw him into the Furnaces! knowest thou not that he Will unchain Orc? &amp; let loose Satan, Og, Sihon &amp; Anak, Upon the Body of Albion? for this he is come! behold it written Upon his fibrous left Foot black! most dismal to our eyes The Shadowy Female shudders thro' heaven in torment inexpressible! And all the Daughters of Los prophetic wail: yet in deceit, They weave a new Religion from new Jealousy of Theotormon! Miltons Religion is the cause: there is no end to destruction! Seeing the Churches at their Period in terror &amp; despair: Rahab created Voltaire; Tirzah created Rousseau; Asserting the Self-righteousness against the Universal Saviour, Mocking the Confessors &amp; Martyrs, claiming Self-righteousness; With cruel Virtue: making War upon the Lambs Redeemed; To perpetuate War &amp; Glory. to perpetuate the Laws of Sin: They perverted Swedenborgs Visions in Beulah &amp; in Ulro; To destroy Jerusalem as a Harlot &amp; her Sons as Reprobates; To raise up Mystery the Virgin Harlot Mother of War, Babylon the Great, the Abomination of Desolation! O Swedenborg! strongest of men, the Samson shorn by the Churches! Shewing the Transgresors in Hell, the proud Warriors in Heaven: Heaven as a Punisher &amp; Hell as One under Punishment: With Laws from Plato &amp; his Greeks to renew the Trojan Gods, In Albion; &amp; to deny the value of the Saviours blood. But then I rais'd up Whitefield, Palamabron raisd up Westley, And these are the cries of the Churches before the two Witnesses['] Faith in God the dear Saviour who took on the likeness of men: Becoming obedient to death, even the death of the Cross The Witnesses lie dead in the Street of the Great City No Faith is in all the Earth: the Book of God is trodden under Foot: He sent his two Servants Whitefield &amp; Westley; were they Prophets Or were they Idiots or Madmen? shew us Miracles! PLATE 23 Can you have greater Miracles than these? Men who devote Their lifes whole comfort to intire scorn &amp; injury &amp; death Awake thou sleeper on the Rock of Eternity Albion awake The trumpet of Judgment hath twice sounded: all Nations are awake But thou art still heavy and dull: Awake Albion awake! Lo Orc arises on the Atlantic. Lo his blood and fire Glow on Americas shore: Albion turns upon his Couch He listens to the sounds of War, astonishd and confounded: He weeps into the Atlantic deep, yet still in dismal dreams Unwakend! and the Covering Cherub advances from the East: How long shall we lay dead in the Street of the great City How long beneath the Covering Cherub give our Emanations Milton will utterly consume us &amp; thee our beloved Father[.] He hath enterd into the Covering Cherub, becoming one with Albions dread Sons, Hand, Hyle &amp; Coban surround him as A girdle; Gwendolen &amp; Conwenna as a garment woven Of War &amp; Religion; let us descend &amp; bring him chained To Bowlahoola O father most beloved! O mild Parent! Cruel in thy mildness, pitying and permitting evil Tho strong and mighty to destroy, O Los our beloved Father! Like the black storm, coming out of Chaos, beyond the stars: It issues thro the dark &amp; intricate caves of the Mundane Shell Passing the planetary visions, &amp; the well adorned Firmament The Sun rolls into Chaos &amp; the stars into the Desarts; And then the storms become visible, audible &amp; terrible, Covering the light of day, &amp; rolling down upon the mountains, Deluge all the country round. Such is a vision of Los; When Rintrah &amp; Palamabron spoke; and such his stormy face Appeard, as does the face of heaven, when coverd with thick storms Pitying and loving tho in frowns of terrible perturbation But Los dispersd the clouds even as the strong winds of Jehovah. And Los thus spoke. O noble Sons, be patient yet a little[.] I have embracd the falling Death, he is become One with me O Sons we live not by wrath. by mercy alone we live! I recollect an old Prophecy in Eden recorded in gold; and oft Sung to the harp: That Milton of the land of Albion Should up ascend forward from Felphams Vale &amp; break the Chain Of Jealousy from all its roots; be patient therefore O my Sons These lovely Females form sweet night and silence and secret Obscurities to hide from Satans Watch-Fiends. Human loves And graces; lest they write them in their Books, &amp; in the Scroll Of mortal life, to condemn the accused; who at Satans Bar Tremble in Spectrous Bodies continually day and night While on the Earth they live in sorrowful Vegetations O when shall we tread our Wine-presses in heaven; and Reap Our wheat with shoutings of joy, and leave the Earth in peace Remember how Calvin and Luther in fury premature Sow'd War and stern division between Papists &amp; Protestants Let it not be so now! O go not forth in Martyrdoms &amp; Wars We were plac'd here by the Universal Brotherhood &amp; Mercy With powers fitted to circumscribe this dark Satanic death And that the Seven Eyes of God may have space for Redemption. But how this is as yet we know not, and we cannot know; Till Albion is arisen; then patient wait a little while, Six Thousand years are passd away the end approaches fast; This mighty one is come from Eden, he is of the Elect, Who died from Earth &amp; he is returnd before the Judgment. This thing Was never known that one of the holy dead should willing return Then patient wait a little while till the Last Vintage is over: Till we have quenchd the Sun of Salah in the Lake of Udan Adan O my dear Sons! leave not your Father, as your brethren left me[.] Twelve Sons successive fled away in that thousand years of sorrow PLATE 24 Of Palamabrons Harrow, &amp; of Rintrahs wrath &amp; fury: Reuben &amp; Manazzoth &amp; Gad &amp; Simeon &amp; Levi, And Ephraim &amp; Judah were Generated, because They left me, wandering with Tirzah: Enitharmon wept One thousand years, and all the Earth was in a watry deluge We calld him Menassheh because of the Generations of Tirzah Because of Satan: &amp; the Seven Eyes of God continually Guard round them, but I the Fourth Zoa am also set The Watchman of Eternity, the Three are not! &amp; I am preserved Still my four mighty ones are left to me in Golgonooza Still Rintrah fierce, and Palamabron mild &amp; piteous Theotormon filld with care, Bromion loving Science You O my Sons still guard round Los. O wander not &amp; leave me Rintrah, thou well rememberest when Amalek &amp; Canaan Fled with their Sister Moab into that abhorred Void They became Nations in our sight beneath the hands of Tirzah. And Palamabron thou rememberest when Joseph an infant; Stolen from his nurses cradle wrapd in needle-work Of emblematic texture, was sold to the Amalekite, Who carried him down into Egypt where Ephraim &amp; Menassheh Gatherd my Sons together in the Sands of Midian And if you also flee away and leave your Fathers side, Following Milton into Ulro, altho your power is great Surely you also shall become poor mortal vegetations Beneath the Moon of Ulro: pity then your Fathers tears[.] When Jesus raisd Lazarus from the Grave I stood &amp; saw Lazarus who is the Vehicular Body of Albion the Redeemd Arise into the Covering Cherub who is the Spectre of Albion By martyrdoms to suffer: to watch over the Sleeping Body. Upon his Rock beneath his Tomb. I saw the Covering Cherub Divide Four-fold into Four Churches when Lazarus arose Paul, Constantine, Charlemaine, Luther; behold they stand before us Stretchd over Europe &amp; Asia. come O Sons, come, come away Arise O Sons give all your strength against Eternal Death Lest we are vegetated, for Cathedrons Looms weave only Death A Web of Death: &amp; were it not for Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda No Human Form but only a Fibrous Vegetation A Polypus of soft affections without Thought or Vision Must tremble in the Heavens &amp; Earths thro all the Ulro space[.] Throw all the Vegetated Mortals into Bowlahoola But as to this Elected Form who is returnd again He is the Signal that the Last Vintage now approaches Nor Vegetation may go on till all the Earth is reapd So Los spoke. Furious they descended to Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda Indignant. unconvincd by Los's arguments &amp; thun[d]ers rolling They saw that wrath now swayd and now pity absorbd him As it was, so it remaind &amp; no hope of an end. Bowlahoola is namd Law. by mortals, Tharmas founded it: Because of Satan, before Luban in the City of Golgonooza. But Golgonooza is namd Art &amp; Manufacture by mortal men. In Bowlahoola Los's Anvils stand &amp; his Furnaces rage; Thundering the Hammers beat &amp; the Bellows blow loud Living self moving mourning lamenting &amp; howling incessantly Bowlahoola thro all its porches feels tho' too fast founded Its pillars &amp; porticoes to tremble at the force Of mortal or immortal arm: and softly lilling flutes Accordant with the horrid labours make sweet melody The Bellows are the Animal Lungs: the Hammers the Animal Heart The Furnaces the Stomach for digestion. terrible their fury Thousands &amp; thousands labour. thousands play on instruments Stringed or fluted to ameliorate the sorrows of slavery Loud sport the dancers in the dance of death, rejoicing in carnage The hard dentant Hammers are lulld by the flutes lula lula The bellowing Furnaces['] blare by the long sounding clarion The double drum drowns howls &amp; groans, the shrill fife. shrieks &amp; cries: The crooked horn mellows the hoarse raving serpent, terrible but harmonious Bowlahoola is the Stomach in every individual man. Los is by mortals nam'd Time Enitharmon is nam'd Space But they depict him bald &amp; aged who is in eternal youth All powerful and his locks flourish like the brows of morning He is the Spirit of Prophecy the ever apparent Elias Time is the mercy of Eternity; without Times swiftness Which is the swiftest of all things: all were eternal torment: All the Gods of the Kingdoms of Earth labour in Los's Halls. Every one is a fallen Son of the Spirit of Prophecy He is the Fourth Zoa, that stood arou[n]d the Throne Divine. PLATE 25 Loud shout the Sons of Luvah, at the Wine-presses as Los descended With Rintrah &amp; Palamabron in his fires of resistless fury. The Wine-press on the Rhine groans loud, but all its central beams Act more terrific in the central Cities of the Nations Where Human Thought is crushd beneath the iron hand of Power. There Los puts all into the Press, the Opressor &amp; the Opressed Together, ripe for the Harvest &amp; Vintage &amp; ready for the Loom. They sang at the Vintage. This is the Last Vintage! &amp; Seed Shall no more be sown upon Earth, till all the Vintage is over And all gatherd in, till the Plow has passd over the Nations And the Harrow &amp; heavy thundering Roller upon the mountains And loud the Souls howl round the Porches of Golgonooza Crying O God deliver us to the Heavens or to the Earths, That we may preach righteousness &amp; punish the sinner with death. But Los refused, till all the Vintage of Earth was gatherd in. And Los stood &amp; cried to the Labourers of the Vintage in voice of awe. Fellow Labourers! The Great Vintage &amp; Harvest is now upon Earth The whole extent of the Globe is explored: Every scatterd Atom Of Human Intellect now is flocking to the sound of the Trumpet All the Wisdom which was hidden in caves &amp; dens, from ancient Time; is now sought out from Animal &amp; Vegetable &amp; Mineral The Awakener is come. outstretchd over Europe! the Vision of God is fulfilled The Ancient Man upon the Rock of Albion Awakes, He listens to the sounds of War astonishd &amp; ashamed; He sees his Children mock at Faith and deny Providence Therefore you must bind the Sheaves not by Nations or Families You shall bind them in Three Classes; according to their Classes So shall you bind them.. Separating What has been Mixed Since Men began to be Wove into Nations by Rahab &amp; Tirzah Since Albions Death &amp; Satans Cutting-off from our awful Fields; When under pretence to benevolence the Elect Subdud All From the Foundation of the World. The Elect is one Class: You Shall bind them separate: they cannot Believe in Eternal Life Except by Miracle &amp; a New Birth. The other two Classes; The Reprobate who never cease to Believe, and the Redeemd, Who live in doubts &amp; fears perpetually tormented by the Elect These you shall bind in a twin-bundle for the Consummation— But the Elect must be saved [from] fires of Eternal Death, To be formed into the Churches of Beulah that they destroy not the Earth For in every Nation &amp; every Family the Three Classes are born And in every Species of Earth, Metal, Tree, Fish, Bird &amp; Beast. We form the Mundane Egg, that Spectres coming by fury or amity, All is the same, &amp; every one remains in his own energy[.] Go forth Reapers with rejoicing. you sowed in tears But the time of your refreshing cometh, only a little moment Still abstain from pleasure &amp; rest in the labours of eternity And you shall Reap the whole Earth from Pole to Pole! from Sea to Sea Begin[n]ing at Jerusalems Inner Court, Lambeth ruin'd and given To the detestable Gods of Priam, to Apollo: and at the Asylum Given to Hercules, who labour in Tirzahs Looms for bread Who set Pleasure against Duty: who Create Olympic crowns To make Learning a burden &amp; the Work of the Holy Spirit: Strife. T[o] Thor &amp; cruel Odin who first reard the Polar Caves Lambeth mourns calling Jerusalem. she weeps &amp; looks abroad For the Lords coming, that Jerusalem may overspread all Nations[.] Crave not for the mortal &amp; perishing delights, but leave them To the weak, and pity the weak as your infant care; Break not Forth in your wrath lest you also are vegetated by Tirzah Wait till the Judgement is past, till the Creation is consumed And then rush forward with me into the glorious spiritual Vegetation; the Supper of the Lamb &amp; his Bride; and the Awaking of Albion our friend and ancient companion. So Los spoke. But lightnings of discontent broke on all sides round And murmurs of thunder rolling heavy long &amp; loud over the mountains While Los calld his Sons around him to the Harvest &amp; the Vintage. Thou seest the Constellations in the deep &amp; wondrous Night They rise in order and continue their immortal courses Upon the mountains &amp; in vales with harp &amp; heavenly song With flute &amp; clarion; with cups &amp; measures filld with foaming wine. Glittring the streams reflect the Vision of beatitude, And the calm Ocean joys beneath &amp; smooths his awful waves! PLATE 26 These are the Sons of Los, &amp; these the Labourers of the Vintage Thou seest the gorgeous clothed Flies that dance &amp; sport in summer Upon the sunny brooks &amp; meadows: every one the dance Knows in its intricate mazes of delight artful to weave: Each one to sound his instruments of music in the dance, To touch each other &amp; recede; to cross &amp; change &amp; return These are the Children of Los; thou seest the Trees on mountains The wind blows heavy, loud they thunder thro' the darksom sky Uttering prophecies &amp; speaking instructive words to the sons Of men: These are the Sons of Los! These the Visions of Eternity But we see only as it were the hem of their garments When with our vegetable eyes we view these wond'rous Visions There are Two Gates thro which all Souls descend. One Southward From Dover Cliff to Lizard Point. the other toward the North Caithness &amp; rocky Durness, Pentland &amp; John Groats House. The Souls descending to the Body, wail on the right hand Of Los; &amp; those deliverd from the Body, on the left hand For Los against the east his force continually bends Along the Valleys of Middlesex from Hounslow to Blackheath Lest those Three Heavens of Beulah should the Creation destroy And lest they should descend before the north &amp; south Gates Groaning with pity, he among the wailing Souls laments. And these the Labours of the Sons of Los in Allamanda: And in the City of Golgonooza: &amp; in Luban: &amp; around The Lake of Udan-Adan, in the Forests of Entuthon Benython Where Souls incessant wail, being piteous Passions &amp; Desires With neither lineament nor form but like to watry clouds The Passions &amp; Desires descend upon the hungry winds For such alone Sleepers remain meer passion &amp; appetite; The Sons of Los clothe them &amp; feed &amp; provide houses &amp; fields And every Generated Body in its inward form, Is a garden of delight &amp; a building of magnificence, Built by the Sons of Los in Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda And the herbs &amp; flowers &amp; furniture &amp; beds &amp; chambers Continually woven in the Looms of Enitharmons Daughters In bright Cathedrons golden Dome with care &amp; love &amp; tears[.] For the various Classes of Men are all markd out determinate In Bowlahoola; &amp; as the Spectres choose their affinities So they are born on Earth, &amp; every Class is determinate But not by Natural but by Spiritual power alone. Because The Natural power continually seeks &amp; tends to Destruction Ending in Death: which would of itself be Eternal Death And all are Class'd by Spiritual, &amp; not by Natural power. And every Natural Effect has a Spiritual Cause, and Not A Natural: for a Natural Cause only seems, it is a Delusion Of Ulro: &amp; a ratio of the perishing Vegetable Memory. PLATE 27 But the Wine-press of Los is eastward of Golgonooza, before the Seat Of Satan. Luvah laid the foundation &amp; Urizen finish'd it in howling woe. How red the sons &amp; daughters of Luvah! here they tread the grapes. Laughing &amp; shouting drunk with odours many fall oerwearied Drownd in the wine is many a youth &amp; maiden: those around Lay them on skins of Tygers &amp; of the spotted Leopard &amp; the Wild Ass Till they revive, or bury them in cool grots, making lamentation. This Wine-press is call'd War on Earth, it is the Printing-Press Of Los; and here he lays his words in order above the mortal brain As cogs are formd in a wheel to turn the cogs of the adverse wheel. Timbrels &amp; violins sport round the Wine-presses; the little Seed; The sportive Root, the Earth-worm, the gold Beetle; the wise Emmet; Dance round the Wine-presses of Luvah: the Centipede is there: The ground Spider with many eyes: the Mole clothed in velvet The ambitious Spider in his sullen web; the lucky golden Spinner; The Earwig armd: the tender Maggot emblem of immortality: The Flea: Louse: Bug: the Tape-Worm: all the Armies of Disease: Visible or invisible to the slothful vegetating Man. The slow Slug: the Grasshopper that sings &amp; laughs &amp; drinks: Winter comes, he folds his slender bones without a murmur. The cruel Scorpion is there: the Gnat: Wasp: Hornet &amp; the Honey Bee: The Toad &amp; venomous Newt; the Serpent clothd in gems &amp; gold: They throw off their gorgeous raiment: they rejoice with loud jubilee Around the Wine-presses of Luvah, naked &amp; drunk with wine. There is the Nettle that stings with soft down; and there The indignant Thistle: whose bitterness is bred in his milk: Who feeds on contempt of his neighbour: there all the idle Weeds That creep around the obscure places, shew their various limbs. Naked in all their beauty dancing round the Wine-presses. But in the Wine-presses the Human grapes sing not, nor dance They howl &amp; writhe in shoals of torment; in fierce flames consuming, In chains of iron &amp; in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires. In pits &amp; dens &amp; shades of death: in shapes of torment &amp; woe. The plates &amp; screws &amp; wracks &amp; saws &amp; cords &amp; fires &amp; cisterns The cruel joys of Luvahs Daughters lacerating with knives And whips their Victims &amp; the deadly sport of Luvahs Sons. They dance around the dying, &amp; they drink the howl &amp; groan They catch the shrieks in cups of gold, they hand them to one another: These are the sports of love, &amp; these the sweet delights of amorous play Tears of the grape, the death sweat of the cluster the last sigh Of the mild youth who listens to the lureing songs of Luvah But Allamanda calld on Earth Commerce, is the Cultivated land Around the City of Golgonooza in the Forests of Entuthon: Here the Sons of Los labour against Death Eternal; through all The Twenty-seven Heavens of Beulah in Ulro, Seat of Satan, Which is the False Tongue beneath Beulah: it is the Sense of Touch: The Plow goes forth in tempests &amp; lightnings &amp; the Harrow cruel In blights of the east; the heavy Roller follows in howlings of woe. Urizens sons here labour also; &amp; here are seen the Mills Of Theotormon, on the verge of the Lake of Udan-Adan: These are the starry voids of night &amp; the depths &amp; caverns of earth These Mills are oceans, clouds &amp; waters ungovernable in their fury Here are the stars created &amp; the seeds of all things planted And here the Sun &amp; Moon recieve their fixed destinations But in Eternity the Four Arts: Poetry, Painting, Music, And Architecture which is Science: are the Four Faces of Man. Not so in Time &amp; Space: there Three are shut out, and only Science remains thro Mercy: &amp; by means of Science, the Three Become apparent in Time &amp; Space, in the Three Professions Poetry in Religion: Music, Law: Painting, in Physic &amp; Surgery: That Man may live upon Earth till the time of his awaking, And from these Three, Science derives every Occupation of Men. And Science is divided into Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda. PLATE 28 Some Sons of Los surround the Passions with porches of iron &amp; silver Creating form &amp; beauty around the dark regions of sorrow, Giving to airy nothing a name and a habitation Delightful! with bounds to the Infinite putting off the Indefinite Into most holy forms of Thought: (such is the power of inspiration) They labour incessant; with many tears &amp; afflictions: Creating the beautiful House for the piteous sufferer. Others; Cabinets richly fabricate of gold &amp; ivory; For Doubts &amp; fears unform'd &amp; wretched &amp; melancholy The little weeping Spectre stands on the threshold of Death Eternal; and sometimes two Spectres like lamps quivering And often malignant they combat (heart-breaking sorrowful &amp; piteous) Antamon takes them into his beautiful flexible hands, As the Sower takes the seed, or as the Artist his clay Or fine wax, to mould artful a model for golden ornaments. The soft hands of Antamon draw the indelible line: Form immortal with golden pen; such as the Spectre admiring Puts on the sweet form; then smiles Antamon bright thro his windows The Daughters of beauty look up from their Loom &amp; prepare. The integument soft for its clothing with joy &amp; delight. But Theotormon &amp; Sotha stand in the Gate of Luban anxious Their numbers are seven million &amp; seven thousand &amp; seven hundred They contend with the weak Spectres, they fabricate soothing forms The Spectre refuses. he seeks cruelty. they create the crested Cock Terrified the Spectre screams &amp; rushes in fear into their Net Of kindness &amp; compassion &amp; is born a weeping terror. Or they create the Lion &amp; Tyger in compassionate thunderings[.] Howling the Spectres flee: they take refuge in Human lineaments. The Sons of Ozoth within the Optic Nerve stand fiery glowing And the number of his Sons is eight millions &amp; eight. They give delights to the man unknown; artificial riches They give to scorn, &amp; their posessors to trouble &amp; sorrow &amp; care, Shutting the sun. &amp; moon. &amp; stars. &amp; trees. &amp; clouds. &amp; waters. And hills. out from the Optic Nerve &amp; hardening it into a bone Opake. and like the black pebble on the enraged beach. While the poor indigent is like the diamond which tho cloth'd In rugged covering in the mine, is open all within And in his hallowd center holds the heavens of bright eternity Ozoth here builds walls of rocks against the surging sea And timbers crampt with iron cramps bar in the joys of life From fell destruction in the Spectrous cunning or rage. He Creates The speckled Newt, the Spider &amp; Beetle, the Rat &amp; Mouse, The Badger &amp; Fox: they worship before his feet in trembling fear. But others of the Sons of Los build Moments &amp; Minutes &amp; Hours And Days &amp; Months &amp; Years &amp; Ages &amp; Periods; wondrous buildings And every Moment has a Couch of gold for soft repose, (A Moment equals a pulsation of the artery) And between every two Moments stands a Daughter of Beulah To feed the Sleepers on their Couches with maternal care. And every Minute has an azure Tent with silken Veils. And every Hour has a bright golden Gate carved with skill. And every Day &amp; Night, has Walls of brass &amp; Gates of adamant, Shining like precious stones &amp; ornamented with appropriate signs: And every Month, a silver paved Terrace builded high: And every Year, invulnerable Barriers with high Towers. And every Age is Moated deep with Bridges of silver &amp; gold: And every Seven Ages is Incircled with a Flaming Fire. Now Seven Ages is amounting to Two Hundred Years Each has its Guard. each Moment Minute Hour Day Month &amp; Year. All are the work of Fairy hands of the Four Elements The Guard are Angels of Providence on duty evermore Every Time less than a pulsation of the artery Is equal in its period &amp; value to Six Thousand Years. PLATE 29 For in this Period the Poets Work is Done: and all the Great Events of Time start forth &amp; are concievd in such a Period Within a Moment: a Pulsation of the Artery. The Sky is an immortal Tent built by the Sons of Los And every Space that a Man views around his dwelling-place: Standing on his own roof, or in his garden on a mount Of twenty-five cubits in height, such space is his Universe; And on its verge the Sun rises &amp; sets. the Clouds bow To meet the flat Earth &amp; the Sea in such an orderd Space: The Starry heavens reach no further but here bend and set On all sides &amp; the two Poles turn on their valves of gold: And if he move his dwelling-place, his heavens also move. Wher'eer he goes &amp; all his neighbourhood bewail his loss: Such are the Spaces called Earth &amp; such its dimension: As to that false appearance which appears to the reasoner, As of a Globe rolling thro Voidness, it is a delusion of Ulro The Microscope knows not of this nor the Telescope. they alter The ratio of the Spectators Organs but leave Objects untouchd For every Space larger than a red Globule of Mans blood. Is visionary: and is created by the Hammer of Los And every Space smaller than a Globule of Mans blood. opens Into Eternity of which this vegetable Earth is but a shadow: The red Globule is the unwearied Sun by Los created To measure Time and Space to mortal Men. every morning. Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda are placed on each side Of that Pulsation &amp; that Globule, terrible their power. But Rintrah &amp; Palamabron govern over Day &amp; Night In Allamanda &amp; Entuthon Benython where Souls wail: Where Orc incessant howls burning in fires of Eternal Youth, Within the vegetated mortal Nerves; for every Man born is joined Within into One mighty Polypus, and this Polypus is Orc. But in the Optic vegetative Nerves Sleep was transformed To Death in old time by Satan the father of Sin &amp; Death And Satan is the Spectre of Orc &amp; Orc is the generate Luvah But in the Nerves of the Nostrils, Accident being formed Into Substance &amp; Principle, by the cruelties of Demonstration It became Opake &amp; Indefinite; but the Divine Saviour, Formed it into a Solid by Los's Mathematic power. He named the Opake Satan: he named the Solid Adam And in the Nerves of the Ear, (for the Nerves of the Tongue are closed) On Albions Rock Los stands creating the glorious Sun each morning And when unwearied in the evening he creates the Moon Death to delude, who all in terror at their splendor leaves His prey while Los appoints, &amp; Rintrah &amp; Palamabron guide The Souls clear from the Rock of Death, that Death himself may wake In his appointed season when the ends of heaven meet. Then Los conducts the Spirits to be Vegetated, into Great Golgonooza, free from the four iron pillars of Satans Throne (Temperance, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, the four pillars of tyranny) That Satans Watch-Fiends touch them not before they Vegetate. But Enitharmon and her Daughters take the pleasant charge. To give them to their lovely heavens till the Great Judgment Day Such is their lovely charge. But Rahab &amp; Tirzah pervert Their mild influences, therefore the Seven Eyes of God walk round The Three Heavens of Ulro, where Tirzah &amp; her Sisters Weave the black Woof of Death upon Entuthon Benython In the Vale of Surrey where Horeb terminates in Rephaim The stamping feet of Zelophehads Daughters are coverd with Human gore Upon the treddles of the Loom: they sing to the winged shuttle: The River rises above his banks to wash the Woof: He takes it in his arms: he passes it in strength thro his current The veil of human miseries is woven over the Ocean From the Atlantic to the Great South Sea, the Erythrean. Such is the World of Los the labour of six thousand years. Thus Nature is a Vision of the Science of the Elohim. End of the First Book. Book the Second. How wide the Gulf &amp; Unpassable! between Simplicity &amp; Insipidity Contraries are Positives. A Negation is not a Contrary PLATE 30 There is a place where Contrarieties are equally True This place is called Beulah, It is a pleasant lovely Shadow Where no dispute can come. Because of those who Sleep. Into this place the Sons &amp; Daughters of Ololon descended With solemn mourning, into Beulahs moony shades &amp; hills Weeping for Milton: mute wonder held the Daughters of Beulah Enrapturd with affection sweet and mild benevolence Beulah is evermore Created around Eternity; appearing To the Inhabitants of Eden, around them on all sides. But Beulah to its Inhabitants appears within each district As the beloved infant in his mothers bosom round incircled With arms of love &amp; pity &amp; sweet compassion. But to The Sons of Eden the moony habitations of Beulah, Are from Great Eternity a mild &amp; pleasant Rest. And it is thus Created. Lo the Eternal Great Humanity To whom be Glory &amp; Dominion Evermore Amen Walks among all his awful Family seen in every face As the breath of the Almighty. such are the words of man to man In the great Wars of Eternity, in fury of Poetic Inspiration, To build the Universe stupendous: Mental forms Creating But the Emanations trembled exceedingly, nor could they Live, because the life of Man was too exceeding unbounded His joy became terrible to them, they trembled &amp; wept Crying with one voice. Give us a habitation &amp; a place In which we may be hidden under the shadow of wings For if we who are but for a time, &amp; who pass away in winter Behold these wonders of Eternity we shall consume But you O our Fathers &amp; Brothers, remain in Eternity But grant us a Temporal Habitation. do you speak To us; we will obey your words as you obey Jesus The Eternal who is blessed for ever &amp; ever. Amen. So spake the lovely Emanations; &amp; there appeard a pleasant Mild Shadow above: beneath: &amp; on all sides round, PLATE 31 Into this pleasant Shadow all the weak &amp; weary Like Women &amp; Children were taken away as on wings Of dovelike softness, &amp; shadowy habitations prepared for them But every Man returnd &amp; went still going forward thro' The Bosom of the Father in Eternity on Eternity Neither did any lack or fall into Error without A Shadow to repose in all the Days of happy Eternity Into this pleasant Shadow Beulah, all Ololon descended And when the Daughters of Beulah heard the lamentation All Beulah wept, for they saw the Lord coming in the Clouds. And the Shadows of Beulah terminate in rocky Albion. And all Nations wept in affliction Family by Family Germany wept towards France &amp; Italy: England wept &amp; trembled Towards America: India rose up from his golden bed: As one awakend in the night: they saw the Lord coming In the Clouds of Ololon with Power &amp; Great Glory! And all the Living Creatures of the Four Elements, wail'd With bitter wailing: these in the aggregate are named Satan And Rahab: they know not of Regeneration, but only of Generation The Fairies, Nymphs, Gnomes &amp; Genii of the Four Elements Unforgiving &amp; unalterable: these cannot be Regenerated But must be Created, for they know only of Generation These are the Gods of the Kingdoms of the Earth: in contrarious And cruel oppositon: Element against Element, opposed in War Not Mental, as the Wars of Eternity, but a Corporeal Strife In Los's Halls continual labouring in the Furnaces of Golgonooza Orc howls on the Atlantic: Enitharmon trembles: All Beulah weeps Thou hearest the Nightingale begin the Song of Spring; The Lark sitting upon his earthy bed: just as the morn Appears; listens silent; then springing from the waving Corn-field! loud He leads the Choir of Day! trill, trill, trill, trill, Mounting upon the wings of light into the Great Expanse: Reecchoing against the lovely blue &amp; shining heavenly Shell: His little throat labours with inspiration; every feather On throat &amp; breast &amp; wings vibrates with the effluence Divine All Nature listens silent to him &amp; the awful Sun Stands still upon the Mountain looking on this little Bird With eyes of soft humility, &amp; wonder love &amp; awe. Then loud from their green covert all the Birds begin their Song The Thrust, the Linnet &amp; the Goldfinch, Robin &amp; the Wren Awake the Sun from his sweet reverie upon the Mountain: The Nightingale again assays his song, &amp; thro the day, And thro the night warbles luxuriant; every Bird of Song Attending his loud harmony with admiration &amp; love. This is a Vision of the lamentation of Beulah over Ololon! Thou percievest the Flowers put forth their precious Odours! And none can tell how from so small a center comes such sweets Forgetting that within that Center Eternity expands Its ever during doors, that Og &amp; Anak fiercely guard[.] First eer the morning breaks joy opens in the flowery bosoms Joy even to tears, which the Sun rising dries; first the Wild Thyme And Meadow-sweet downy &amp; soft waving among the reeds. Light springing on the air lead the sweet Dance: they wake The Honeysuckle sleeping on the Oak: the flaunting beauty Revels along upon the wind; the White-thorn lovely May Opens her many lovely eyes: listening the Rose still sleeps None dare to wake her. soon she bursts her crimson curtaind bed And comes forth in the majesty of beauty; every Flower: The Pink, the Jessamine, the Wall-flower, the Carnation The Jonquil, the mild Lilly opes her heavens! every Tree, And Flower &amp; Herb soon fill the air with an innumerable Dance Yet all in order sweet &amp; lovely, Men are sick with Love! Such is a Vision of the lamentation of Beulah over Ololon PLATE 32 And Milton oft sat up on the Couch of Death &amp; oft conversed In vision &amp; dream beatific with the Seven Angels of the Presence I have turned my back upon these Heavens builded on cruelty My Spectre still wandering thro' them follows my Emanation He hunts her footsteps thro' the snow &amp; the wintry hail &amp; rain The idiot Reasoner laughs at the Man of Imagination And from laughter proceeds to murder by undervaluing calumny Then Hillel who is Lucifer replied over the Couch of Death And thus the Seven Angels instructed him &amp; thus they converse. We are not Individuals but States: Combinations of Individuals We were Angels of the Divine Presence: &amp; were Druids in Annandale Compelld to combine into Form by Satan, the Spectre of Albion, Who made himself a God &amp;, destroyed the Human Form Divine. But the Divine Humanity &amp; Mercy gave us a Human Form [HEBREW] as multitudes Vox Populi Because we were combind in Freedom &amp; holy Brotherhood While those combind by Satans Tyranny first in the blood of War And Sacrifice &amp;, next, in Chains of imprisonment: are Shapeless Rocks Retaining only Satans Mathematic Holiness, Length: Bredth &amp; Highth Calling the Human Imagination: which is the Divine Vision &amp; Fruition In which Man liveth eternally: madness &amp; blasphemy, against Its own Qualities, which are Servants of Humanity, not Gods or Lords[.] Distinguish therefore States from Individuals in those States. States Change: but Individual Identities never change nor cease: You cannot go to Eternal Death in that which can never Die. Satan &amp; Adam are States Created into Twenty-seven Churches And thou O Milton art a State about to be Created Called Eternal Annihilation that none but the Living shall Dare to enter: &amp; they shall enter triumphant over Death And Hell &amp; the Grave: States that are not, but ah! Seem to be. Judge then of thy Own Self: thy Eternal Lineaments explore What is Eternal &amp; what Changeable? &amp; what Annihilable! The Imagination is not a State: it is the Human Existence itself Affection or Love becomes a State, when divided from Imagination The Memory is a State always, &amp; the Reason is a State Created to be Annihilated &amp; a new Ratio Created Whatever can be Created can be Annihilated Forms cannot The Oak is cut down by the Ax, the Lamb falls by the Knife But their Forms Eternal Exist, For-ever. Amen Halle[l]ujah Thus they converse with the Dead watching round the Couch of Death. For God himself enters Death's Door always with those that enter And lays down in the Grave with them, in Visions of Eternity Till they awake &amp; see Jesus &amp; the Linen Clothes lying That the Females had Woven for them, &amp; the Gates of their Fathers House PLATE 33 And the Divine Voice was heard in the Songs of Beulah Saying When I first Married you, I gave you all my whole Soul I thought that you would love my loves &amp; joy in my delights Seeking for pleasures in my pleasures O Daughter of Babylon Then thou wast lovely, mild &amp; gentle. now thou art terrible In jealousy &amp; unlovely in my sight, because thou hast cruelly Cut off my loves in fury till I have no love left for thee Thy love depends on him thou lovest &amp; on his dear loves Depend thy pleasures which thou hast cut off by jealousy Therefore I shew my Jealousy &amp; set before you Death. Behold Milton descended to Redeem the Female Shade From Death Eternal; such your lot, to be continually Redeem'd By death &amp; misery of those you love &amp; by Annihilation When the Sixfold Female percieves that Milton annihilates Himself: that seeing all his loves by her cut off: he leaves Her also: intirely abstracting himself from Female loves She shall relent in fear of death: She shall begin to give Her maidens to her husband: delighting in his delight And then &amp; then alone begins the happy Female joy As it is done in Beulah, &amp; thou O Virgin Babylon Mother of Whoredoms Shalt bring Jerusalem in thine arms in the night watches; and No longer turning her a wandering Harlot in the streets Shalt give her into the arms of God your Lord &amp; Husband. Such are the Songs of Beulah in the Lamentations of Ololon PLATE 34 And all the Songs of Beulah sounded comfortable notes To comfort Ololons lamentation, for they said[:] Are you the Fiery Circle that late drove in fury &amp; fire The Eight Immortal Starry-Ones down into Ulro dark Rending the Heavens of Beulah with your thunders &amp; lightnings And can you thus lament &amp; can you pity &amp; forgive? Is terror changd to pity O wonder of Eternity! And the Four States of Humanity in its Repose, Were shewed them. First of Beulah a most pleasant Sleep On Couches soft, with mild music, tended by Flowers of Beulah Sweet Female forms, winged or floating in the air spontaneous The Second State is Alla &amp; the third State Al-Ulro; But the Fourth State is dreadful; it is named Or-Ulro: The First State is in the Head, the Second is in the Heart: The Third in the Loins &amp; Seminal Vessels &amp; the Fourth In the Stomach &amp; Intestines terrible, deadly, unutterable And he whose Gates are opend in those Regions of his Body Can from those Gates view all these wondrous Imaginations But Ololon sought the Or-Ulro &amp; its fiery Gates And the Couches of the Martyrs: &amp; many Daughters of Beulah Accompany them down to the Ulro with soft melodious tears A long journey &amp; dark thro Chaos in the track of Miltons course To where the Contraries of Beulah War beneath Negations Banner Then view'd from Miltons Track they see the Ulro: a vast Polypus Of living fibres down into the Sea of Time &amp; Space growing A self-devouring monstrous Human Death Twenty-seven fold[.] Within it sit Five Females &amp; the nameless Shadowy Mother Spinning it from their bowels with songs of amorous delight And melting cadences that lure the Sleepers of Beulah down The River Storge (which is Arnon) into the Dead Sea: Around this Polypus Los continual builds the Mundane Shell Four Universes round the Universe of Los remain Chaotic Four intersecting Globes, &amp; the Egg form'd World of Los In midst; stretching from Zenith to Nadir, in midst of Chaos[.] One of these Ruind Universes is to the North named Urthona One to the South this was the glorious World of Urizen One to the East, of Luvah: One to the West; of Tharmas. But when Luvah assumed the World of Urizen in the South All fell towards the Center sinking downward in dire Ruin Here in these Chaoses the Sons of Ololon took their abode In Chasms of the Mundane Shell which open on all sides round! Southward &amp; by the East within the Breach of Miltons descent To watch the time, pitying &amp; gentle to awaken Urizen They stood in a dark land of death of fiery corroding waters Where lie in evil death the Four Immortals pale and cold And the Eternal Man, even Albion, upon the Rock of Ages[.] Seeing Miltons Shadow, some Daughters of Beulah trembling Returnd, but Ololon remaind before the Gates of the Dead And Ololon looked down into the Heavens of Ulro in fear They said. How are the Wars of man which in Great Eternity Appear around, in the External Spheres of Visionary Life Here renderd Deadly within the Life &amp; Interior Vision How are the Beasts &amp; Birds &amp; Fishes, &amp; Plants &amp; Minerals Here fixd into a frozen bulk subject to decay &amp; death[?] Those Visions of Human Life &amp; Shadows of Wisdom &amp; Knowledge PLATE 35 Are here frozen to unexpansive deadly destroying terrors[.] And War &amp; Hunting: the Two Fountains of the River of Life Are become Fountains of bitter Death &amp; of corroding Hell Till Brotherhood is changd into a Curse &amp; a Flattery By Differences between Ideas, that Ideas themselves, (which are The Divine Members) may be slain in offerings for sin O dreadful Loom of Death! O piteous Female forms compelld To weave the Woof of Death, On Camberwell Tirzahs Courts Malahs on Blackheath, Rahab &amp; Noah. dwell on Windsors heights Where once the Cherubs of Jerusalem spread to Lambeths Vale Milcahs Pillars shine from Harrow to Hampstead where Hoglah On Highgates heights magnificent Weaves over trembling Thames To Shooters Hill and thence to Blackheath the dark Woof! Loud Loud roll the Weights &amp; Spindles over the whole Earth let down On all sides round to the Four Quarters of the World, eastward on Europe to Euphrates &amp; Hindu, to Nile &amp; back in Clouds Of Death across the Atlantic to America North &amp; South So spake Ololon in reminiscence astonishd, but they Could not behold Golgonooza without passing the Polypus A wondrous journey not passable by Immortal feet, &amp; none But the Divine Saviour can pass it without annihilation. For Golgonooza cannot be seen till having passd the Polypus It is viewed on all sides round by a Four-fold Vision Or till you become Mortal &amp; Vegetable in Sexuality Then you behold its mighty Spires &amp; Domes of ivory &amp; gold And Ololon examined all the Couches of the Dead. Even of Los &amp; Enitharmon &amp; all the Sons of Albion And his Four Zoas terrified &amp; on the verge of Death In midst of these was Miltons Couch, &amp; when they saw Eight Immortal Starry-Ones, guarding the Couch in flaming fires They thunderous utterd all a universal groan falling down Prostrate before the Starry Eight asking with tears forgiveness Confessing their crime with humiliation and sorrow. O how the Starry Eight rejoic'd to see Ololon descended! And now that a wide road was open to Eternity, By Ololons descent thro Beulah to Los &amp; Enitharmon. For mighty were the multitudes of Ololon, vast the extent Of their great sway, reaching from Ulro to Eternity Surrounding the Mundane Shell outside in its Caverns And through Beulah. and all silent forbore to contend With Ololon for they saw the Lord in the Clouds of Ololon There is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot find Nor can his Watch Fiends find it, but the Industrious find This Moment &amp; it multiply. &amp; when it once is found It renovates every Moment of the Day if rightly placed[.] In this Moment Ololon descended to Los &amp; Enitharmon Unseen beyond the Mundane Shell Southward in Miltons track Just in this Moment when the morning odours rise abroad And first from the Wild Thyme, stands a Fountain in a rock Of crystal flowing into two Streams, one flows thro Golgonooza And thro Beulah to Eden beneath Los's western Wall The other flows thro the Aerial Void &amp; all the Churches Meeting again in Golgonooza beyond Satans Seat The Wild Thyme is Los's Messenger to Eden, a mighty Demon Terrible deadly &amp; poisonous his presence in Ulro dark Therefore he appears only a small Root creeping in grass Covering over the Rock of Odours his bright purple mantle Beside the Fount above the Larks nest in Golgonooza Luvah slept here in death &amp; here is Luvahs empty Tomb Ololon sat beside this Fountain on the Rock of Odours. Just at the place to where the Lark mounts, is a Crystal Gate It is the enterance of the First Heaven named Luther: for The Lark is Los's Messenger thro the Twenty-seven Churches That the Seven Eyes of God who walk even to Satans Seat Thro all the Twenty-seven Heavens may not slumber nor sleep But the Larks Nest is at the Gate of Los, at the eastern Gate of wide Golgonooza &amp; the Lark is Los's Messenger PLATE 36 When on the highest lift of his light pinions he arrives At that bright Gate, another Lark meets him &amp; back to back They touch their pinions tip tip: and each descend To their respective Earths &amp; there all night consult with Angels Of Providence &amp; with the Eyes of God all night in slumbers Inspired: &amp; at the dawn of day send out another Lark Into another Heaven to carry news upon his wings Thus are the Messengers dispatchd till they reach the Earth again In the East Gate of Golgonooza, &amp; the Twenty-eighth bright Lark. met the Female Ololon descending into my Garden Thus it appears to Mortal eyes &amp; those of the Ulro Heavens But not thus to Immortals, the Lark is a mighty Angel. For Ololon step'd into the Polypus within the Mundane Shell They could not step into Vegetable Worlds without becoming The enemies of Humanity except in a Female Form And as One Female, Ololon and all its mighty Hosts Appear'd: a Virgin of twelve years nor time nor space was To the perception of the Virgin Ololon but as the Flash of lightning but more quick the Virgin in my Garden Before my Cottage stood, for the Satanic Space is delusion For when Los joind with me he took me in his firy whirlwind My Vegetated portion was hurried from Lambeths shades He set me down in Felphams Vale &amp; prepard a beautiful Cottage for me that in three years I might write all these Visions To display Natures cruel holiness: the deceits of Natural Religion[.] Walking in my Cottage Garden, sudden I beheld The Virgin Ololon &amp; address'd her as a Daughter of Beulah Virgin of Providence fear not to enter into my Cottage What is thy message to thy friend? What am I now to do Is it again to plunge into deeper affliction? behold me Ready to obey, but pity thou my Shadow of Delight Enter my Cottage, comfort her, for she is sick with fatigue PLATE 37 The Virgin answerd. Knowest thou of Milton who descended Driven from Eternity; him I seek! terrified at my Act In Great Eternity which thou knowest! I come him to seek So Ololon utterd in words distinct the anxious thought Mild was the voice, but more distinct than any earthly That Miltons Shadow heard &amp; condensing all his Fibres Into a strength impregnable of majesty &amp; beauty infinite I saw he was the Covering Cherub &amp; within him Satan And Raha[b], in an outside which is fallacious! within Beyond the outline of Identity, in the Selfhood deadly And he appeard the Wicker Man of Scandinavia in whom Jerusalems children consume in flames among the Stars Descending down into my Garden, a Human Wonder of God Reaching from heaven to earth a Cloud &amp; Human Form I beheld Milton with astonishment &amp; in him beheld The Monstrous Churches of Beulah, the Gods of Ulro dark Twelve monstrous dishumanizd terrors Synagogues of Satan. A Double Twelve &amp; Thrice Nine: such their divisions. And these their Names &amp; their Places within the Mundane Shell In Tyre &amp; Sidon I saw Baal &amp; Ashtaroth. In Moab Chemosh In Ammon, Molech: loud his Furnaces rage among the Wheels Of Og, &amp; pealing loud the cries of the Victims of Fire! And pale his Priestesses infolded in Veils of Pestilence, border'd With War; Woven in Looms of Tyre &amp; Sidon by beautiful Ashtaroth. In Palestine Dagon, Sea Monster! worshipd o'er the Sea. Thammuz in Lebanon &amp; Rimmon in Damascus curtaind Osiris: Isis: Orus: in Egypt: dark their Tabernacles on Nile Floating with solemn songs, &amp; on the Lakes of Egypt nightly With pomp, even till morning break &amp; Osiris appear in the sky But Belial of Sodom &amp; Gomorrha, obscure Demon of Bribes And secret Assasinations, not worshipd nor adord; but With the finger on the lips &amp; the back turnd to the light And Saturn Jove &amp; Rhea of the Isles of the Sea remote These Twelve Gods. are the Twelve Spectre Sons of the Druid Albion And these the names of the Twenty-seven Heavens &amp; their Churches Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech: these are Giants mighty Hermaphroditic Noah, Shem, Arphaxad, Cainan the second, Salah, Heber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, these are the Female-Males A Male within a Female hid as in an Ark &amp; Curtains, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Paul, Constantine, Charlemaine Luther, these seven are the Male-Females, the Dragon Forms Religion hid in War, a Dragon red &amp; hidden Harlot All these are seen in Miltons Shadow who is the Covering Cherub The Spectre of Albion in which the Spectre of Luvah inhabits In the Newtonian Voids between the Substances of Creation For the Chaotic Voids outside of the Stars are measured by The Stars, which are the boundaries of Kingdoms, Provinces And Empires of Chaos invisible to the Vegetable Man The Kingdom of Og. is in Orion: Sihon is in Ophiucus Og has Twenty-seven Districts; Sihons Districts Twenty-one From Star to Star, Mountains &amp; Valleys, terrible dimension Stretchd out, compose the Mundane Shell, a mighty Incrustation Of Forty-eight deformed Human Wonders of the Almighty With Caverns whose remotest bottoms meet again beyond The Mundane Shell in Golgonooza, but the Fires of Los, rage In the remotest bottoms of the Caves, that none can pass Into Eternity that way, but all descend to Los To Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda &amp; to Entuthon Benython The Heavens are the Cherub, the Twelve Gods are Satan PLATE 38 And the Forty-eight Starry Regions are Cities of the Levites The Heads of the Great Polypus, Four-fold twelve enormity In mighty &amp; mysterious comingling enemy with enemy Woven by Urizen into Sexes from his mantle of years[.] And Milton collecting all his fibres into impregnable strength Descended down a Paved work of all kinds of precious stones Out from the eastern sky; descending down into my Cottage Garden: clothed in black, severe &amp; silent he descended. The Spectre of Satan stood upon the roaring sea &amp; beheld Milton within his sleeping Humanity! trembling &amp; shuddring He stood upon the waves a Twenty-seven-fold mighty Demon Gorgeous &amp; beautiful: loud roll his thunders against Milton Loud Satan thunderd, loud &amp; dark upon mild Felpham shore Not daring to touch one fibre he howld round upon the Sea. I also stood in Satans bosom &amp; beheld its desolations! A ruind Man: a ruind building of God not made with hands; Its plains of burning sand, its mountains of marble terrible: Its pits &amp; declivities flowing with molten ore &amp; fountains Of pitch &amp; nitre: its ruind palaces &amp; cities &amp; mighty works; Its furnaces of affliction in which his Angels &amp; Emanations Labour with blackend visages among its stupendous ruins Arches &amp; pyramids &amp; porches colonades &amp; domes: In which dwells Mystery Babylon, here is her secret place From hence she comes forth on the Churches in delight Here is her Cup filld with its poisons, in these horrid vales And here her scarlet Veil woven in pestilence &amp; war: Here is Jerusalem bound in chains, in the Dens of Babylon In the Eastern porch of Satans Universe Milton stood &amp; said Satan! my Spectre! I know my power thee to annihilate And be a greater in thy place, &amp; be thy Tabernacle A covering for thee to do thy will, till one greater comes And smites me as I smote thee &amp; becomes my covering. Such are the Laws of thy false Heavns! but Laws of Eternity Are not such: know thou: I come to Self Annihilation Such are the Laws of Eternity that each shall mutually Annihilate himself for others good, as I for thee[.] Thy purpose &amp; the purpose of thy Priests &amp; of thy Churches Is to impress on men the fear of death; to teach Trembling &amp; fear, terror, constriction; abject selfishness Mine is to teach Men to despise death &amp; to go on In fearless majesty annihilating Self, laughing to scorn Thy Laws &amp; terrors, shaking down thy Synagogues as webs I come to discover before Heavn &amp; Hell the Self righteousness In all its Hypocritic turpitude, opening to every eye These wonders of Satans holiness shewing to the Earth The Idol Virtues of the Natural Heart, &amp; Satans Seat Explore in all its Selfish Natural Virtue &amp; put off In Self annihilation all that is not of God alone: To put off Self &amp; all I have ever &amp; ever Amen Satan heard!

And there went forth from the Starry limbs of the Seven: Forms Human; with Trumpets innumerable, sounding articulate As the Seven spake; and they stood in a mighty Column of Fire Surrounding Felphams Vale, reaching to the Mundane Shell, Saying Awake Albion awake! reclaim thy Reasoning Spectre. Subdue Him to the Divine Mercy, Cast him down into the Lake Of Los, that ever burneth with fire, ever &amp; ever Amen! Let the Four Zoa's awake from Slumbers of Six Thousand Years Then loud the Furnaces of Los were heard! &amp; seen as Seven Heavens Stretching from south to north over the mountains of Albion Satan heard; trembling round his Body, he incircled it He trembled with exceeding great trembling &amp; astonishment Howling in his Spectre round his Body hungring to devour But fearing for the pain for if he touches a Vital, His torment is unendurable: therefore he cannot devour: But howls round it as a lion round his prey continually. Loud Satan thunderd, loud &amp; dark upon mild Felphams Shore Coming in a Cloud with Trumpets &amp; with Fiery Flame An awful Form eastward from midst of a bright Paved-work Of precious stones by Cherubim surrounded: so permitted (Lest he should fall apart in his Eternal Death) to imitate The Eternal Great Humanity Divine surrounded by His Cherubim &amp; Seraphim in ever happy Eternity Beneath sat Chaos: Sin on his right hand Death on his left And Ancient Night spread over all the heavn his Mantle of Laws He trembled with exceeding great trembling &amp; astonishment Then Albion rose up in the Night of Beulah on his Couch Of dread repose seen by the visionary eye; his face is toward The east, toward Jerusalems Gates: groaning he sat above His rocks. London &amp; Bath &amp; Legions &amp; Edinburgh Are the four pillars of his Throne; his left foot near London Covers the shades of Tyburn: his instep from Windsor To Primrose Hill stretching to Highgate &amp; Holloway London is between his knees: its basements fourfold His right foot stretches to the sea on Dover cliffs, his heel On Canterburys ruins; his right hand covers lofty Wales His left Scotland; his bosom girt with gold involves York, Edinburgh, Durham &amp; Carlisle &amp; on the front Bath, Oxford, Cambridge Norwich; his right elbow Leans on the Rocks of Erins Land, Ireland ancient nation[.] His head bends over London: he sees his embodied Spectre Trembling before him with exceeding great trembling &amp; fear He views Jerusalem &amp; Babylon, his tears flow down He movd his right foot to Cornwall, his left to the Rocks of Bognor He strove to rise to walk into the Deep. but strength failing Forbad &amp; down with dreadful groans he sunk upon his Couch In moony Beulah. Los his strong Guard walks round beneath the Moon Urizen faints in terror striving among the Brooks of Arnon With Miltons Spirit: as the Plowman or Artificer or Shepherd While in the labours of his Calling sends his Thought abroad To labour in the ocean or in the starry heaven. So Milton Labourd in Chasms of the Mundane Shell, tho here before My Cottage midst the Starry Seven, where the Virgin Ololon Stood trembling in the Porch: loud Satan thunder'd on the stormy Sea Circling Albions Cliffs in which the Four-fold World resides Tho seen in fallacy outside: a fallacy of Satans Churches PLATE 40 Before Ololon Milton stood &amp; percievd the Eternal Form Of that mild Vision; wondrous were their acts by me unknown Except remotely; and I heard Ololon say to Milton I see thee strive upon the Brooks of Arnon. there a dread And awful Man I see, oercoverd with the mantle of years. I behold Los &amp; Urizen. I behold Orc &amp; Tharmas; The Four Zoa's of Albion &amp; thy Spirit with them striving In Self annihilation giving thy life to thy enemies Are those who contemn Religion &amp; seek to annihilate it Become in their Femin[in]e portions the causes &amp; promoters Of these Religions, how is this thing? this Newtonian Phantasm This Voltaire &amp; Rousseau: this Hume &amp; Gibbon &amp; Bolingbroke This Natural Religion! this impossible absurdity Is Ololon the cause of this? O where shall I hide my face These tears fall for the little-ones: the Children of Jerusalem Lest they be annihilated in thy annihilation. No sooner she had spoke but Rahab Babylon appeard Eastward upon the Paved work across Europe &amp; Asia Glorious as the midday Sun in Satans bosom glowing A Female hidden in a Male, Religion hidden in War Namd Moral Virtue; cruel two-fold Monster shining bright A Dragon red &amp; hidden Harlot which John in Patmos saw And all beneath the Nations innumerable of Ulro Appeard, the Seven Kingdoms of Canaan &amp; Five Baalim Of Philistea. into Twelve divided, calld after the Names Of Israel: as they are in Eden. Mountain. River &amp; Plain City &amp; sandy Desart intermingled beyond mortal ken But turning toward Ololon in terrible majesty Milton Replied. Obey thou the Words of the Inspired Man All that can be annihilated must be annihilated That the Children of Jerusalem may be saved from slavery There is a Negation, &amp; there is a Contrary The Negation must be destroyd to redeem the Contraries The Negation is the Spectre; the Reasoning Power in Man This is a false Body: an Incrustation over my Immortal Spirit; a Selfhood, which must be put off &amp; annihilated alway To cleanse the Face of my Spirit by Self-examination. PLATE 41 To bathe in the Waters of Life; to wash off the Not Human I come in Self-annihilation &amp; the grandeur of Inspiration To cast off Rational Demonstration by Faith in the Saviour To cast off the rotten rags of Memory by Inspiration To cast off Bacon, Locke &amp; Newton from Albions covering To take off his filthy garments, &amp; clothe him with Imagination To cast aside from Poetry, all that is not Inspiration That it no longer shall dare to mock with the aspersion of Madness Cast on the Inspired, by the tame high finisher of paltry Blots, Indefinite, or paltry Rhymes; or paltry Harmonies. Who creeps into State Government like a catterpiller to destroy To cast off the idiot Questioner who is always questioning, But never capable of answering; who sits with a sly grin Silent plotting when to question, like a thief in a cave; Who publishes doubt &amp; calls it knowledge; whose Science is Despair, Whose pretence to knowledge is Envy, whose whole Science is To destroy the wisdom of ages to gratify ravenous Envy; That rages round him like a Wolf day &amp; night without rest He smiles with condescension; he talks of Benevolence &amp; Virtue And those who act with Benevolence &amp; Virtue, they murder time on time These are the destroyers of Jerusalem, these are the murderers Of Jesus, who deny the Faith &amp; mock at Eternal Life!

PLATE 3SHEEP COATS To the Public After my three years slumber on the banks of the Ocean, I again display my Giant forms to the Public: My former Giants &amp; Fairies having reciev'd the highest reward possible: the [love] and [friendship] of those with whom to be connected, is to be [blessed:] I cannot doubt that this more consolidated &amp; extended Work, will be as kindly recieved The Enthusiasm of the following Poem, the Author hopes [no Reader will think presumptuousness or arroganc[e] when he is reminded that the Ancients entrusted their love to their Writing, to the full as Enthusiastically as I have who Acknowledge mine for my Saviour and Lord, for they were wholly absorb'd in their Gods.] I also hope the Reader will be with me, wholly One in Jesus our Lord, who is the God [of Fire] and Lord [of Love] to whom the Ancients look'd and saw his day afar off, with trembling &amp; amazement. The Spirit of Jesus is continual forgiveness of Sin: he who waits to be righteous before he enters into the Saviours kingdom, the Divine Body; will never enter there. I am perhaps the most sinful of men! I pretend not to holiness! yet I pretend to love, to see, to converse with daily, as man with man, &amp; the more to have an interest in the Friend of Sinners. Therefore [Dear] Reader, [forgive] what you do not approve, &amp; [love] me for this energetic exertion of my talent. Reader! [lover] of books! [lover] of heaven, And of that God from whom [all books are given,] Who in mysterious Sinais awful cave To Man the wond'rous art of writing gave, Again he speaks in thunder and in fire! Thunder of Thought, &amp; flames of fierce desire: Even from the depths of Hell his voice I hear, Within the unfathomd caverns of my Ear. Therefore I print; nor vain my types shall be: Heaven, Earth &amp; Hell, henceforth shall live in harmony Of the Measure, in which the following Poem is written We who dwell on Earth can do nothing of ourselves, every thing is conducted by Spirits, no less than Digestion or Sleep. [to Note the last words of Jesus, ????? ??? ???? ??????? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ???] When this Verse was first dictated to me I consider'd a Monotonous Cadence like that used by Milton &amp; Shakspeare &amp; all writers of English Blank Verse, derived from the modern bondage of Rhyming; to be a necessary and indispensible part of Verse. But I soon found that in the mouth of a true Orator such monotony was not only awkward, but as much a bondage as rhyme itself. I therefore have produced a variety in every line, both of cadences &amp; number of syllables. Every word and every letter is studied and put into its fit place: the terrific numbers are reserved for the terrific parts—the mild &amp; gentle, for the mild &amp; gentle parts, and the prosaic, for inferior parts: all are necessary to each other Poetry Fetter'd, Fetters the Human Race!

This theme calls me in sleep night after night, &amp; ev'ry morn Awakes me at sun-rise, then I see the Saviour over me Spreading his beams of love, &amp; dictating the words of this mild song. Awake! awake O sleeper of the land of shadows, wake! expand! I am in you and you in me, mutual in love divine: Fibres of love from man to man thro Albions pleasant land. In all the dark Atlantic vale down from the hills of Surrey A black water accumulates, return Albion! return! Thy brethren call thee, and thy fathers, and thy sons, Thy nurses and thy mothers, thy sisters and thy daughters Weep at thy souls disease, and the Divine Vision is darkend: Thy Emanation that was wont to play before thy face, Beaming forth with her daughters into the Divine bosom [Where!!] Where hast thou hidden thy Emanation lovely Jerusalem From the vision and fruition of the Holy-one? I am not a God afar off, I am a brother and friend; Within your bosoms I reside, and you reside in me: Lo! we are One; forgiving all Evil; Not seeking recompense! Ye are my members O ye sleepers of Beulah, land of shades! But the perturbed Man away turns down the valleys dark; [Saying. We are not One: we are Many, thou most simulative] Phantom of the over heated brain! shadow of immortality! Seeking to keep my soul a victim to thy Love! which binds Man the enemy of man into deceitful friendships: Jerusalem is not! her daughters are indefinite: By demonstration, man alone can live, and not by faith. My mountains are my own, and I will keep them to myself: The Malvern and the Cheviot, the Wolds Plinlimmon &amp; Snowdon Are mine. here will I build my Laws of Moral Virtue! Humanity shall be no more: but war &amp; princedom &amp; victory! So spoke Albion in jealous fears, hiding his Emanation Upon the Thames and Medway, rivers of Beulah: dissembling His jealousy before the throne divine, darkening, cold! PLATE 5 The banks of the Thames are clouded! the ancient porches of Albion are Darken'd! they are drawn thro' unbounded space, scatter'd upon The Void in incoherent despair! Cambridge &amp; Oxford &amp; London, Are driven among the starry Wheels, rent away and dissipated, In Chasms &amp; Abysses of sorrow, enlarg'd without dimension, terrible[.] Albions mountains run with blood, the cries of war &amp; of tumult Resound into the unbounded night, every Human perfection Of mountain &amp; river &amp; city, are small &amp; wither'd &amp; darken'd Cam is a little stream!

Yet they forgive my wanderings, I rest not from my great task!

Guide thou my hand which trembles exceedingly upon the rock of ages, While I write of the building of Golgonooza, &amp; of the terrors of Entuthon: Of Hand &amp; Hyle &amp; Coban, of Kwantok, Peachey, Brereton, Slayd &amp; Hutton: Of the terrible sons &amp; daughters of Albion. and their Generations. Scofield! Kox, Kotope and Bowen, rovolve most mightily upon The Furnace of Los: before the eastern gate bending their fury. They war, to destroy the Furnaces, to desolate Golgonooza: And to devour the Sleeping Humanity of Albion in rage &amp; hunger. They revolve into the Furnaces Southward &amp; are driven forth Northward Divided into Male and Female forms time after time. From these Twelve all the Families of England spread abroad. The Male is a Furnace of beryll; the Female is a golden Loom; I behold them and their rushing fires overwhelm my Soul, In Londons darkness; and my tears fall day and night, Upon the Emanations of Albions Sons! the Daughters of Albion Names anciently rememberd, but now contemn'd as fictions! Although in every bosom they controll our Vegetative powers. These are united into Tirzah and her Sisters, on Mount Gilead, Cambel &amp; Gwendolen &amp; Conwenna &amp; Cordella &amp; Ignoge. And these united into Rahab in the Covering Cherub on Euphrates Gwiniverra &amp; Gwinefred, &amp; Gonorill &amp; Sabrina beautiful, Estrild, Mehetabel &amp; Ragan, lovely Daughters of Albion, They are the beautiful Emanations of the Twelve Sons of Albion The Starry Wheels revolv'd heavily over the Furnaces; Drawing Jerusalem in anguish of maternal love, Eastward a pillar of a cloud with Vala upon the mountains Howling in pain, redounding from the arms of Beulahs Daughters, Out from the Furnaces of Los above the head of Los. A pillar of smoke writhing afar into Non-Entity, redounding Till the cloud reaches afar outstretch'd among the Starry Wheels Which revolve heavily in the mighty Void above the Furnaces O what avail the loves &amp; tears of Beulahs lovely Daughters They hold the Immortal Form in gentle bands &amp; tender tears But all within is open'd into the deeps of Entuthon Benython A dark and unknown night, indefinite, unmeasurable, without end. Abstract Philosophy warring in enmity against Imagination (Which is the Divine Body of the Lord Jesus. blessed for ever). And there Jerusalem wanders with Vala upon the mountains, Attracted by the revolutions of those Wheels the Cloud of smoke Immense, and Jerusalem &amp; Vala weeping in the Cloud Wander away into the Chaotic Void, lamenting with her Shadow Among the Daughters of Albion, among the Starry Wheels; Lamenting for her children, for the sons &amp; daughters of Albion Los heard her lamentations in the deeps afar! his tears fall Incessant before the Furnaces, and his Emanation divided in pain, Eastward toward the Starry Wheels. But Westward, a black Horror, PLATE 6 His spectre driv'n by the Starry Wheels of Albions sons, black and Opake divided from his back; he labours and he mourns! For as his Emanation divided, his Spectre also divided In terror of those starry wheels: and the Spectre stood over Los Howling in pain: a blackning Shadow, blackning dark &amp; opake Cursing the terrible Los: bitterly cursing him for his friendship To Albion, suggesting murderous thoughts against Albion. Los rag'd and stamp'd the earth in his might &amp; terrible wrath! He stood and stampd the earth! then he threw down his hammer in rage &amp; In fury: then he sat down and wept, terrified! Then arose And chaunted his song, labouring with the tongs and hammer: But still the Spectre divided, and still his pain increas'd! In pain the Spectre divided: in pain of hunger and thirst: To devour Los's Human Perfection, but when he saw that Los PLATE 7 Was living: panting like a frighted wolf, and howling He stood over the Immortal, in the solitude and darkness: Upon the darkning Thames, across the whole Island westward. A horrible Shadow of Death, among the Furnaces: beneath The pillar of folding smoke; and he sought by other means, To lure Los: by tears, by arguments of science &amp; by terrors: Terrors in every Nerve, by spasms &amp; extended pains: While Los answer'd unterrified to the opake blackening Fiend And thus the Spectre spoke: Wilt thou still go on to destruction? Till thy life is all taken away by this deceitful Friendship? He drinks thee up like water! like wine he pours thee Into his tuns: thy Daughters are trodden in his vintage He makes thy Sons the trampling of his bulls, they are plow'd And harrowd for his profit, lo! thy stolen Emanation Is his garden of pleasure! all the Spectres of his Sons mock thee Look how they scorn thy once admired palaces! now in ruins Because of Albion! because of deceit and friendship! For Lo! Hand has peopled Babel &amp; Nineveh: Hyle, Ashur &amp; Aram: Cobans son is Nimrod: his son Cush is adjoind to Aram, By the Daughter of Babel, in a woven mantle of pestilence &amp; war. They put forth their spectrous cloudy sails; which drive their immense Constellations over the deadly deeps of indefinite Udan-Adan[.] Kox is the Father of Shem &amp; Ham &amp; Japheth, he is the Noah Of the Flood of Udan-Adan. Hut'n is the Father of the Seven From Enoch to Adam; Schofield is Adam who was New- Created in Edom. I saw it indignant, &amp; thou art not moved! This has divided thee in sunder: and wilt thou still forgive? O! thou seest not what I see! what is done in the Furnaces. Listen, I will tell thee what is done in moments to thee unknown: Luvah was cast into the Furnaces of affliction and sealed, And Vala fed in cruel delight, the Furnaces with fire: Stern Urizen beheld; urgd by necessity to keep The evil day afar, and if perchance with iron power He might avert his own despair: in woe &amp; fear he saw Vala incircle round the Furnaces where Luvah was clos'd: With joy she heard his howlings, &amp; forgot he was her Luvah, With whom she liv'd in bliss in times of innocence &amp; youth! Vala comes from the Furnace in a cloud, but wretched Luvah Is howling in the Furnaces, in flames among Albions Spectres, To prepare the Spectre of Albion to reign over thee O Los, Forming the Spectres of Albion according to his rage: To prepare the Spectre sons of Adam, who is Scofield: the Ninth Of Albions sons, &amp; the father of all his brethren in the Shadowy Generation. Cambel &amp; Gwendolen wove webs of war &amp; of Religion, to involve all Albions sons, and when they had Involv'd Eight; their webs roll'd outwards into darkness And Scofield the Ninth remaind on the outside of the Eight And Kox, Kotope, &amp; Bowen, One in him, a Fourfold Wonder Involv'd the Eight: Such are the Generations of the Giant Albion, To separate a Law of Sin, to punish thee in thy members. Los answer'd. Altho' I know not this! I know far worse than this: I know that Albion hath divided me, and that thou O my Spectre, Hast just cause to be irritated: but look stedfastly upon me: Comfort thyself in my strength the time will arrive, When all Albions injuries shall cease, and when we shall Embrace him tenfold bright, rising from his tomb in immortality. They have divided themselves by Wrath. they must be united by Pity: let us therefore take example &amp; warning O my Spectre, O that I could abstain from wrath! O that the Lamb Of God would look upon me and pity me in my fury. In anguish of regeneration! in terrors of self annihilation: Pity must join together those whom wrath has torn in sunder, And the Religion of Generation which was meant for the destruction Of Jerusalem, become her covering, till the time of the End. O holy Generation [Image] of regeneration! O point of mutual forgiveness between Enemies! Birthplace of the Lamb of God incomprehensible! The Dead despise &amp; scorn thee, &amp; cast thee out as accursed: Seeing the Lamb of God in thy gardens &amp; thy palaces: Where they desire to place the Abomination of Desolation. Hand sits before his furnace: scorn of others &amp; furious pride! Freeze round him to bars of steel &amp; to iron rocks beneath His feet: indignant self-righteousness like whirlwinds of the north! PLATE 8 Rose up against me thundering from the Brook of Albions River From Ranelagh &amp; Strumbolo, from Cromwells gardens &amp; Chelsea The place of wounded Soldiers. but when he saw my Mace Whirld round from heaven to earth, trembling he sat: his cold Poisons rose up: &amp; his sweet deceits coverd them all over With a tender cloud. As thou art now; such was he O Spectre I know thy deceit &amp; thy revenges, and unless thou desist I will certainly create an eternal Hell for thee. Listen! Be attentive! be obedient! Lo the Furnaces are ready to recieve thee. I will break thee into shivers! &amp; melt thee in the furnaces of death; I will cast thee into forms of abhorrence &amp; torment if thou Desist not from thine own will, &amp; obey not my stern command! I am closd up from my children: my Emanation is dividing And thou my Spectre art divided against me. But mark I will compell thee to assist me in my terrible labours. To beat These hypocritic Selfhoods on the Anvils of bitter Death I am inspired: I act not for myself: for Albions sake I now am what I am: a horror and an astonishment Shuddring the heavens to look upon me: Behold what cruelties Are practised in Babel &amp; Shinar, &amp; have approachd to Zions Hill While Los spoke, the terrible Spectre fell shuddring before him Watching his time with glowing eyes to leap upon his prey[.] Los opend the Furnaces in fear. the Spectre saw to Babel &amp; Shinar Across all Europe &amp; Asia. he saw the tortures of the Victims. He saw now from the ou[t]side what he before saw &amp; felt from within He saw that Los was the sole, uncontrolld Lord of the Furnaces Groaning he kneeld before Los's iron-shod feet on London Stone, Hungring &amp; thirsting for Los's life yet pretending obedience. While Los pursud his speech in threat'nings loud &amp; fierce. Thou art my Pride &amp; Self-righteousness: I have found thee out: Thou art reveald before me in all thy magnitude &amp; power The Uncircumcised pretences to Chastity must be cut in sunder! Thy holy wrath &amp; deep deceit cannot avail against me Nor shalt thou ever assume the triple-form of Albions Spectre For I am one of the living: dare not to mock my inspired fury If thou wast cast forth from my life! if I was dead upon the mountains Thou mightest be pitied &amp; lovd: but now I am living; unless Thou abstain ravening I will create an eternal Hell for thee. Take thou this Hammer &amp; in patience heave the thundering Bellows Take thou these Tongs: strike thou alternate with me: labour obedient[.] Hand &amp; Hyle &amp; Koban: Skofeld, Kox &amp; Kotope, labour mightily[.] In the Wars of Babel &amp; Shinar, all their Emanations were Condensd. Hand has absorbd all his Brethren in his might All the infant Loves &amp; Graces were lost, for the mighty Hand PLATE 9 Condens'd his Emanations into hard opake substances; And his infant thoughts &amp; desires, into cold, dark, cliffs of death. His hammer of gold he siezd; and his anvil of adamant. He siez'd the bars of condens'd thoughts, to forge them: Into the sword of war: into the bow and arrow: Into the thundering cannon and into the murdering gun[.] I saw the limbs form'd for exercise, contemn'd: &amp; the beauty of Eternity, look'd upon as deformity &amp; loveliness as a dry tree: I saw disease forming a Body of Death around the Lamb Of God, to destroy Jerusalem, &amp; to devour the body of Albion By war and stratagem to win the labour of the husbandman: Awkwardness arm'd in steel: folly in a helmet of gold: Weakness with horns &amp; talons: ignorance with a rav'ning beak! Every Emanative joy forbidden as a Crime: And the Emanations buried alive in the earth with pomp of religion: Inspiration deny'd; Genius forbidden by laws of punishment! I saw terrified; I took the sighs &amp; tears, &amp; bitter groans: I lifted them into my Furnaces; to form the spiritual sword. That lays open the hidden heart: I drew forth the pang Of sorrow red hot: I workd it on my resolute anvil: I heated it in the flames of Hand, &amp; Hyle, &amp; Coban Nine times; Gwendolen &amp; Cambel &amp; Gwineverra Are melted into the gold, the silver, the liquid ruby, The crysolite, the topaz, the jacinth, &amp; every precious stone. Loud roar my Furnaces and loud my hammer is heard: I labour day and night, I behold the soft affections Condense beneath my hammer into forms of cruelty But still I labour in hope, tho' still my tears flow down. That he who will not defend Truth, may be compelld to defend A Lie: that he may be snared and caught and snared and taken That Enthusiasm and Life may not cease: arise Spectre arise! Thus they contended among the Furnaces with groans &amp; tears; Groaning the Spectre heavd the bellows, obeying Los's frowns; Till the Spaces of Erin were perfected in the furnaces Of affliction, and Los drew them forth, compelling the harsh Spectre. PLATE 10 Into the Furnaces &amp; into the valleys of the Anvils of Death And into the mountains of the Anvils &amp; of the heavy Hammers Till he should bring the Sons &amp; Daughters of Jerusalem to be The Sons &amp; Daughters of Los that he might protect them from Albions dread Spectres; storming, loud, thunderous &amp; mighty The Bellows &amp; the Hammers move compell'd by Los's hand. And this is the manner of the Sons of Albion in their strength They take the Two Contraries which are calld Qualities, with which Every Substance is clothed, they name them Good &amp; Evil From them they make an Abstract, which is a Negation Not only of the Substance from which it is derived A murderer of its own Body: but also a murderer Of every Divine Member: it is the Reasoning Power An Abstract objecting power, that Negatives every thing This is the Spectre of Man: the Holy Reasoning Power And in its Holiness is closed the Abomination of Desolation Therefore Los stands in London building Golgonooza Compelling his Spectre to labours mighty; trembling in fear The Spectre weeps, but Los unmovd by tears or threats remains I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Mans I will not Reason &amp; Compare: my business is to Create So Los, in fury &amp; strength: in indignation &amp; burning wrath Shuddring the Spectre howls. his howlings terrify the night He stamps around the Anvil, beating blows of stern despair He curses Heaven &amp; Earth, Day &amp; Night &amp; Sun &amp; Moon He curses Forest Spring &amp; River, Desart &amp; sandy Waste Cities &amp; Nations, Families &amp; Peoples, Tongues &amp; Laws Driven to desperation by Los's terrors &amp; threatning fears Los cries, Obey my voice &amp; never deviate from my will And I will be merciful to thee: be thou invisible to all To whom I make thee invisible, but chief to my own Children O Spectre of Urthona: Reason not against their dear approach Nor them obstruct with thy temptations of doubt &amp; despair[.] O Shame O strong &amp; mighty Shame I break thy brazen fetters If thou refuse, thy present torments will seem southern breezes To what thou shalt endure if thou obey not my great will. The Spectre answer'd. Art thou not ashamd of those thy Sins That thou callest thy Children? lo the Law of God commands That they be offered upon his Altar: O cruelty &amp; torment For thine are also mine! I have kept silent hitherto, Concerning my chief delight: but thou hast broken silence Now I will speak my mind! Where is my lovely Enitharmon O thou my enemy, where is my Great Sin? She is also thine I said: now is my grief at worst: incapable of being Surpassed: but every moment it accumulates more &amp; more It continues accumulating to eternity! the joys of God advance For he is Righteous: he is not a Being of Pity &amp; Compassion He cannot feel Distress: he feeds on Sacrifice &amp; Offering: Delighting in cries &amp; tears &amp; clothed in holiness &amp; solitude But my griefs advance also, for ever &amp; ever without end O that I could cease to be! Despair! I am Despair Created to be the great example of horror &amp; agony: also my Prayer is vain I called for compassion: compassion mockd[,] Mercy &amp; pity threw the grave stone over me &amp; with lead And iron, bound it over me for ever: Life lives on my Consuming: &amp; the Almighty hath made me his Contrary To be all evil, all reversed &amp; for ever dead: knowing And seeing life, yet living not; how can I then behold And not tremble; how can I be beheld &amp; not abhorrd So spoke the Spectre shuddring, &amp; dark tears ran down his shadowy face Which Los wiped off, but comfort none could give! or beam of hope Yet ceasd he not from labouring at the roarings of his Forge With iron &amp; brass Building Golgonooza in great contendings Till his Sons &amp; Daughters came forth from the Furnaces At the sublime Labours for Los. compelld the invisible Spectre PLATE 11 To labours mighty, with vast strength, with his mighty chains, In pulsations of time, &amp; extensions of space, like Urns of Beulah With great labour upon his anvils[;] &amp; in his ladles the Ore He lifted, pouring it into the clay ground prepar'd with art; Striving with Systems to deliver Individuals from those Systems; That whenever any Spectre began to devour the Dead, He might feel the pain as if a man gnawd his own tender nerves. Then Erin came forth from the Furnaces, &amp; all the Daughters of Beulah Came from the Furnaces, by Los's mighty power for Jerusalems Sake: walking up and down among the Spaces of Erin: And the Sons and Daughters of Los came forth in perfection lovely! And the Spaces of Erin reach'd from the starry heighth, to the starry depth. Los wept with exceeding joy &amp; all wept with joy together! They feard they never more should see their Father, who Was built in from Eternity, in the Cliffs of Albion. But when the joy of meeting was exhausted in loving embrace; Again they lament. O what shall we do for lovely Jerusalem? To protect the Emanations of Albions mighty ones from cruelty? Sabrina &amp; Ignoge begin to sharpen their beamy spears Of light and love: their little children stand with arrows of gold: Ragan is wholly cruel Scofield is bound in iron armour! He is like a mandrake in the earth before Reubens gate: He shoots beneath Jerusalems walls to undermine her foundations! Vala is but thy Shadow, O thou loveliest among women! A shadow animated by thy tears O mournful Jerusalem! PLATE 12 Why wilt thou give to her a Body whose life is but a Shade? Her joy and love, a shade: a shade of sweet repose: But animated and vegetated, she is a devouring worm: What shall we do for thee O lovely mild Jerusalem? And Los said. I behold the finger of God in terrors! Albion is dead! his Emanation is divided from him! But I am living! yet I feel my Emanation also dividing Such thing was never known! O pity me, thou all-piteous-one! What shall I do! or how exist, divided from Enitharmon? Yet why despair! I saw the finger of God go forth Upon my Furnaces, from within the Wheels of Albions Sons: Fixing their Systems, permanent: by mathematic power Giving a body to Falshood that it may be cast off for ever. With Demonstrative Science piercing Apollyon with his own bow! God is within, &amp; without! he is even in the depths of Hell! Such were the lamentations of the Labourers in the Furnaces! And they appeard within &amp; without incircling on both sides The Starry Wheels of Albions Sons, with Spaces for Jerusalem: And for Vala the shadow of Jerusalem: the ever mourning shade: On both sides, within &amp; without beaming gloriously! Terrified at the sublime Wonder, Los stood before his Furnaces. And they stood around, terrified with admiration at Erins Spaces For the Spaces reachd from the starry heighth, to the starry depth; And they builded Golgonooza: terrible eternal labour! What are those golden builders doing? where was the burying-place Of soft Ethinthus? near Tyburns fatal Tree? is that Mild Zions hills most ancient promontory; near mournful Ever weeping Paddington? is that Calvary and Golgotha? Becoming a building of pity and compassion? Lo! The stones are pity, and the bricks, well wrought affections: Enameld with love &amp; kindness, &amp; the tiles engraven gold Labour of merciful hands: the beams &amp; rafters are forgiveness: The mortar &amp; cement of the work, tears of honesty: the nails, And the screws &amp; iron braces, are well wrought blandishments, And well contrived words, firm fixing, never forgotten, Always comforting the remembrance: the floors, humility, The cielings, devotion: the hearths, thanksgiving: Prepare the furniture O Lambeth in thy pitying looms! The curtains, woven tears &amp; sighs, wrought into lovely forms For comfort. there the secret furniture of Jerusalems chamber Is wrought: Lambeth! the Bride the Lambs Wife loveth thee: Thou art one with her &amp; knowest not of self in thy supreme joy. Go on, builders in hope: tho Jerusalem wanders far away, Without the gate of Los: among the dark Satanic wheels. Fourfold the Sons of Los in their divisions: and fourfold, The great City of Golgonooza: fourfold toward the north And toward the south fourfold, &amp; fourfold toward the east &amp; west Each within other toward the four points: that toward Eden, and that toward the World of Generation, And that toward Beulah, and that toward Ulro: Ulro is the space of the terrible starry wheels of Albions sons: But that toward Eden is walled up, till time of renovation: Yet it is perfect in its building, ornaments &amp; perfection. And the Four Points are thus beheld in Great Eternity West, the Circumference: South, the Zenith: North, The Nadir: East, the Center, unapproachable for ever. These are the four Faces towards the Four Worlds of Humanity In every Man. Ezekiel saw them by Chebars flood. And the Eyes are the South, and the Nostrils are the East. And the Tongue is the West, and the Ear is the North. And the North Gate of Golgonooza toward Generation; Has four sculpturd Bulls terrible before the Gate of iron. And iron, the Bulls: and that which looks toward Ulro, Clay bak'd &amp; enamel'd, eternal glowing as four furnaces: Turning upon the Wheels of Albions sons with enormous power. And that toward Beulah four, gold, silver, brass, &amp; iron: PLATE 13 And that toward Eden, four, form'd of gold, silver, brass, &amp; iron. The South, a golden Gate, has four Lions terrible, living! That toward Generation, four, of iron carv'd wondrous: That toward Ulro, four, clay bak'd, laborious workmanship That toward Eden, four; immortal gold, silver, brass &amp; iron. The Western Gate fourfold, is closd: having four Cherubim Its guards, living, the work of elemental hands, laborious task! Like Men, hermaphroditic, each winged with eight wings That towards Generation, iron; that toward Beulah, stone; That toward Ulro, clay: that toward Eden, metals. But all clos'd up till the last day, when the graves shall yield their dead The Eastern Gate, fourfold: terrible &amp; deadly its ornaments: Taking their forms from the Wheels of Albions sons; as cogs Are formd in a wheel, to fit the cogs of the adverse wheel. That toward Eden, eternal ice, frozen in seven folds Of forms of death: and that toward Beulah, stone: The seven diseases of the earth are carved terrible. And that toward Ulro, forms of war: seven enormities: And that toward Generation, seven generative forms. And every part of the City is fourfold; &amp; every inhabitant, fourfold. And every pot &amp; vessel &amp; garment &amp; utensil of the houses, And every house, fourfold; but the third Gate in every one Is closd as with a threefold curtain of ivory &amp; fine linen &amp; ermine. And Luban stands in middle of the City. a moat of fire, Surrounds Luban, Los's Palace &amp; the golden Looms of Cathedron. And sixty-four thousand Genii, guard the Eastern Gate: And sixty-four thousand Gnomes, guard the Northern Gate: And sixty-four thousand Nymphs, guard the Western Gate: And sixty-four thousand Fairies, guard the Southern Gate: Around Golgonooza lies the land of death eternal; a Land Of pain and misery and despair and ever brooding melancholy: In all the Twenty-seven Heavens, numberd from Adam to Luther; From the blue Mundane Shell, reaching to the Vegetative Earth. The Vegetative Universe, opens like a flower from the Earths center: In which is Eternity. It expands in Stars to the Mundane Shell And there it meets Eternity again, both within and without, And the abstract Voids between the Stars are the Satanic Wheels. There is the Cave; the Rock; the Tree; the Lake of Udan Adan; The Forest, and the Marsh, and the Pits of bitumen deadly: The Rocks of solid fire: the Ice valleys: the Plains Of burning sand: the rivers, cataract &amp; Lakes of Fire: The Islands of the fiery Lakes: the Trees of Malice: Revenge: And black Anxiety; and the Cities of the Salamandrine men: (But whatever is visible to the Generated Man, Is a Creation of mercy &amp; love, from the Satanic Void.) The land of darkness flamed but no light, &amp; no repose: The land of snows of trembling, &amp; of iron hail incessant: The land of earthquakes: and the land of woven labyrinths: The land of snares &amp; traps &amp; wheels &amp; pit-falls &amp; dire mills: The Voids, the Solids, &amp; the land of clouds &amp; regions of waters: With their inhabitants: in the Twenty-seven Heavens beneath Beulah: Self-righteousnesses conglomerating against the Divine Vision: A Concave Earth wondrous, Chasmal, Abyssal, Incoherent! Forming the Mundane Shell: above; beneath: on all sides surrounding Golgonooza: Los walks round the walls night and day. He views the City of Golgonooza, &amp; its smaller Cities: The Looms &amp; Mills &amp; Prisons &amp; Work-houses of Og &amp; Anak: The Amalekite: the Canaanite: the Moabite: the Egyptian: And all that has existed in the space of six thousand years: Permanent, &amp; not lost not lost nor vanishd, &amp; every little act, Word, work, &amp; wish, that has existed, all remaining still In those Churches ever consuming &amp; ever building by the Spectres Of all the inhabitants of Earth wailing to be Created: Shadowy to those who dwell not in them, meer possibilities: But to those who enter into them they seem the only substances For every thing exists &amp; not one sigh nor smile nor tear, PLATE 14 One hair nor particle of dust, not one can pass away. He views the Cherub at the Tree of Life, also the Serpent, Orc the first born coild in the south: the Dragon Urizen: Tharmas the Vegetated Tongue even the Devouring Tongue: A threefold region, a false brain: a false heart: And false bowels: altogether composing the False Tongue, Beneath Beulah: as a watry flame revolving every way And as dark roots and stems: a Forest of affliction, growing In seas of sorrow. Los also views the Four Females: Ahania, and Enion, and Vala, and Enitharmon lovely. And from them all the lovely beaming Daughters of Albion, Ahania &amp; Enion &amp; Vala, are three evanescent shades: Enitharmon is a vegetated mortal Wife of Los: His Emanation, yet his Wife till the sleep of Death is past. Such are the Buildings of Los! &amp; such are the Woofs of Enitharmon! And Los beheld his Sons, and he beheld his Daughters: Every one a translucent Wonder: a Universe within, Increasing inwards, into length and breadth, and heighth: Starry &amp; glorious: and they every one in their bright loins: Have a beautiful golden gate which opens into the vegetative world: And every one a gate of rubies &amp; all sorts of precious stones In their translucent hearts, which opens into the vegetative world: And every one a gate of iron dreadful and wonderful, In their translucent heads, which opens into the vegetative world And every one has the three regions Childhood: Manhood: &amp; Age: But the gate of the tongue: the western gate in them is clos'd, Having a wall builded against it: and thereby the gates Eastward &amp; Southward &amp; Northward, are incircled with flaming fires. And the North is Breadth, the South is Heighth &amp; Depth: The East is Inwards: &amp; the West is Outwards every way. And Los beheld the mild Emanation Jerusalem eastward bending Her revolutions toward the Starry Wheels in maternal anguish Like a pale cloud arising from the arms of Beulahs Daughters: In Entuthon Benythons deep Vales beneath Golgonooza. PLATE 15 And Hand &amp; Hyle rooted into Jerusalem by a fibre Of strong revenge &amp; Skofeld Vegetated by Reubens Gate In every Nation of the Earth till the Twelve Sons of Albion Enrooted into every Nation: a mighty Polypus growing From Albion over the whole Earth: such is my awful Vision. I see the Four-fold Man. The Humanity in deadly sleep And its fallen Emanation. The Spectre &amp; its cruel Shadow. I see the Past, Present &amp; Future, existing all at once Before me; O Divine Spirit sustain me on thy wings! That I may awake Albion from his long &amp; cold repose. For Bacon &amp; Newton sheathd in dismal steel, their terrors hang Like iron scourges over Albion, Reasonings like vast Serpents Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations I turn my eyes to the Schools &amp; Universities of Europe And there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages dire Washd by the Water-wheels of Newton. black the cloth In heavy wreathes folds over every Nation; cruel Works Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic Moving by compulsion each other: not as those in Eden: which Wheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony &amp; peace. I see in deadly fear in London Los raging round his Anvil Of death: forming an Ax of gold: the Four Sons of Los Stand round him cutting the Fibres from Albions hills That Albions Sons may roll apart over the Nations While Reuben enroots his brethren in the narrow Canaanite From the Limit Noah to the Limit Abram in whose Loins Reuben in his Twelve-fold majesty &amp; beauty shall take refuge As Abraham flees from Chaldea shaking his goary locks But first Albion must sleep, divided from the Nations I see Albion sitting upon his Rock in the first Winter And thence I see the Chaos of Satan &amp; the World of Adam When the Divine Hand went forth on Albion in the mid Winter And at the place of Death when Albion sat in Eternal Death Among the Furnaces of Los in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom PLATE 16 Hampstead Highgate Finchley Hendon Muswell hill: rage loud Before Bromions iron Tongs &amp; glowing Poker reddening fierce Hertfordshire glows with fierce Vegetation! in the Forests The Oak frowns terrible, the Beech &amp; Ash &amp; Elm enroot Among the Spiritual fires; loud the Corn fields thunder along The Soldiers fife; the Harlots shriek; the Virgins dismal groan The Parents fear: the Brothers jealousy: the Sisters curse Beneath the Storms of Theotormon[;] &amp; the thundring Bellows Heaves in the hand of Palamabron who in Londons darkness Before the Anvil, watches the bellowing flames: thundering The Hammer loud rages in Rintrahs strong grasp swinging loud Round from heaven to earth down falling with heavy blow Dead on the Anvil, where the red hot wedge groans in pain He quenches it in the black trough of his Forge: Londons River Feeds the dread Forge, trembling &amp; shuddering along the Valleys Humber &amp; Trent roll dreadful before the Seventh Furnace And Tweed &amp; Tyne anxious give up their Souls for Albions sake Lincolnshire Derbyshire Nottinghamshire Leicestershire From Oxfordshire to Norfolk on the Lake of Udan Adan Labour within the Furnaces, walking among the Fires With Ladles huge &amp; iron Pokers over the Island white. Scotland pours out his Sons to labour at the Furnaces Wales gives his Daughters to the Looms; England: nursing Mothers Gives to the Children of Albion &amp; to the Children of Jerusalem. From the blue Mundane Shell even to the Earth of Vegetation Throughout the whole Creation which groans to be deliverd Albion groans in the deep slumbers of Death upon his Rock. Here Los fixd down the Fifty-two Counties of England &amp; Wales The Thirty-six of Scotland, &amp; the Thirty-four of Ireland With mighty power, when they fled out at Jerusalems Gates Away from the Conflict of Luvah &amp; Urizen, fixing the Gates In the Twelve Counties of Wales &amp; thence Gates looking every way To the Four Points: conduct to England &amp; Scotland &amp; Ireland And thence to all the Kingdoms &amp; Nations &amp; Families of the Earth[.] The Gate of Reuben in Carmarthenshire: the Gate of Simeon in Cardiganshire: &amp; the Gate of Levi in Montgomeryshire The Gate of Judah Merionethshire: the Gate of Dan Flintshire The Gate of Napthali, Radnorshire: the Gate of Gad Pembrokeshire The Gate of Asher, Carnarvonshire the Gate of Issachar Brecknokshire The Gate of Zebulun, in Anglesea &amp; Sodor. so is Wales divided.

He is The Spectre of the Living pursuing the Emanations of the Dead. Shuddring they flee: they hide in the Druid Temples in cold chastity: Subdued by the Spectre of the Living &amp; terrified by undisguisd desire. For Los said: Tho my Spectre is divided: as I am a Living Man I must compell him to obey me wholly: that Enitharmon may not Be lost: &amp; lest he should devour Enitharmon: Ah me! Piteous image of my soft desires &amp; loves: O Enitharmon! I will compell my Spectre to obey: I will restore to thee thy Children. No one bruises or starves himself to make himself fit for labour! Tormented with sweet desire for these beauties of Albion They would never love my power if they did not seek to destroy Enitharmon: Vala would never have sought &amp; loved Albion If she had not sought to destroy Jerusalem; such is that false And Generating Love: a pretence of love to destroy love: Cruel hipocrisy unlike the lovely delusions of Beulah: And cruel forms, unlike the merciful forms of Beulahs Night They know not why they love nor wherefore they sicken &amp; die Calling that Holy Love: which is Envy Revenge &amp; Cruelty Which separated the stars from the mountains: the mountains from Man And left Man, a little grovelling Root, outside of Himself. Negations are not Contraries: Contraries mutally Exist: But Negations Exist Not: Exceptions &amp; Objections &amp; Unbeliefs Exist not: nor shall they ever be Organized for ever &amp; ever: If thou separate from me, thou art a Negation: a meer Reasoning &amp; Derogation from me, an Objecting &amp; cruel Spite And Malice &amp; Envy: but my Emanation, Alas! will become My Contrary: O thou Negation, I will continually compell Thee to be invisible to any but whom I please, &amp; when And where &amp; how I please, and never! never! shalt thou be Organized But as a distorted &amp; reversed Reflexion in the Darkness And in the Non Entity: nor shall that which is above Ever descend into thee: but thou shalt be a Non Entity for ever And if any enter into thee, thou shalt be an Unquenchable Fire And he shall be a never dying Worm, mutually tormented by Those that thou tormentest, a Hell &amp; Despair for ever &amp; ever. So Los in secret with himself communed &amp; Enitharmon heard In her darkness &amp; was comforted: yet still she divided away In gnawing pain from Los's bosom in the deadly Night; First as a red Globe of blood trembling beneath his bosom[.] Suspended over her he hung: he infolded her in his garments Of wool: he hid her from the Spectre, in shame &amp; confusion of Face; in terrors &amp; pains of Hell &amp; Eternal Death, the Trembling Globe shot forth Self-living &amp; Los howld over it: Feeding it with his groans &amp; tears day &amp; night without ceasing: And the Spectrous Darkness from his back divided in temptations, And in grinding agonies in threats! stiflings! &amp; direful strugglings. Go thou to Skofield: ask him if he is Bath or if he is Canterbury Tell him to be no more dubious: demand explicit words Tell him: I will dash him into shivers, where &amp; at what time I please: tell Hand &amp; Skofield they are my ministers of evil To those I hate: for I can hate also as well as they! PLATE 18 From every-one of the Four Regions of Human Majesty, There is an Outside spread Without, &amp; an Outside spread Within Beyond the Outline of Identity both ways, which meet in One: An orbed Void of doubt, despair, hunger, &amp; thirst &amp; sorrow. Here the Twelve Sons of Albion, join'd in dark Assembly, Jealous of Jerusalems children, asham'd of her little-ones (For Vala produc'd the Bodies. Jerusalem gave the Souls) Became as Three Immense Wheels, turning upon one-another Into Non-Entity, and their thunders hoarse appall the Dead To murder their own Souls, to build a Kingdom among the Dead[:] Cast! Cast ye Jerusalem forth! The Shadow of delusions! The Harlot daughter! Mother of pity and dishonourable forgiveness Our Father Albions sin and shame! But father now no more! Nor sons! nor hateful peace &amp; love, nor soft complacencies With transgressors meeting in brotherhood around the table, Or in the porch or garden. No more the sinful delights Of age and youth and boy and girl and animal and herb, And river and mountain, and city &amp; village, and house &amp; family. Beneath the Oak &amp; Palm, beneath the Vine and Fig-tree. In self-denial!—But War and deadly contention, Between Father and Son, and light and love! All bold asperities Of Haters met in deadly strife, rending the house &amp; garden The unforgiving porches, the tables of enmity, and beds And chambers of trembling &amp; suspition, hatreds of age &amp; youth And boy &amp; girl, &amp; animal &amp; herb, &amp; river &amp; mountain And city &amp; village, and house &amp; family. That the Perfect, May live in glory, redeem'd by Sacrifice of the Lamb And of his children, before sinful Jerusalem. To build Babylon the City of Vala, the Goddess Virgin-Mother. She is our Mother! Nature! Jerusalem is our Harlot-Sister Return'd with Children of pollution, to defile our House, With Sin and Shame. Cast! Cast her into the Potters field. Her little-ones, She must slay upon our Altars: and her aged Parents must be carried into captivity, to redeem her Soul To be for a Shame &amp; a Curse, and to be our Slaves for ever So cry Hand &amp; Hyle the eldest of the fathers of Albions Little-ones; to destroy the Divine Saviour; the Friend of Sinners, Building Castles in desolated places, and strong Fortifications. Soon Hand mightily devour'd &amp; absorb'd Albions Twelve Sons. Out from his bosom a mighty Polypus, vegetating in darkness, And Hyle &amp; Coban were his two chosen ones, for Emissaries In War: forth from his bosom they went and return'd. Like Wheels from a great Wheel reflected in the Deep. Hoarse turn'd the Starry Wheels, rending a way in Albions Loins Beyond the Night of Beulah. In a dark &amp; unknown Night, Outstretch'd his Giant beauty on the ground in pain &amp; tears: PLATE 19 His Children exil'd from his breast pass to and fro before him His birds are silent on his hills, flocks die beneath his branches His tents are fall'n! his trumpets, and the sweet sound of his harp Are silent on his clouded hills, that belch forth storms &amp; fire. His milk of Cows, &amp; honey of Bees, &amp; fruit of golden harvest, Is gather'd in the scorching heat, &amp; in the driving rain: Where once he sat he weary walks in misery and pain: His Giant beauty and perfection fallen into dust: Till from within his witherd breast grown narrow with his woes: The corn is turn'd to thistles &amp; the apples into poison: The birds of song to murderous crows, his joys to bitter groans! The voices of children in his tents, to cries of helpless infants! And self-exiled from the face of light &amp; shine of morning, In the dark world a narrow house! he wanders up and down, Seeking for rest and finding none! and hidden far within, His Eon weeping in the cold and desolated Earth. All his Affections now appear withoutside: all his Sons, Hand, Hyle &amp; Coban, Guantok, Peachey, Brereton, Slayd &amp; Hutton, Scofeld, Kox, Kotope &amp; Bowen; his Twelve Sons: Satanic Mill! Who are the Spectres of the Twentyfour, each Double-form'd: Revolve upon his mountains groaning in pain: beneath The dark incessant sky, seeking for rest and finding none: Raging against their Human natures, ravning to gormandize The Human majesty and beauty of the Twentyfour. Condensing them into solid rocks with cruelty and abhorrence Suspition &amp; revenge, &amp; the seven diseases of the Soul Settled around Albion and around Luvah in his secret cloud[.] Willing the Friends endur'd, for Albions sake, and for Jerusalem his Emanation shut within his bosom; Which hardend against them more and more; as he builded onwards On the Gulph of Death in self-righteousness, that roll'd Before his awful feet, in pride of virtue for victory: And Los was roofd in from Eternity in Albions Cliffs Which stand upon the ends of Beulah, and withoutside, all Appear'd a rocky form against the Divine Humanity. Albions Circumference was clos'd: his Center began darkning Into the Night of Beulah, and the Moon of Beulah rose Clouded with storms: Los his strong Guard walkd round beneath the Moon And Albion fled inward among the currents of his rivers. He found Jerusalem upon the River of his City soft repos'd In the arms of Vala, assimilating in one with Vala The Lilly of Havilah: and they sang soft thro' Lambeths vales, In a sweet moony night &amp; silence that they had created With a blue sky spread over with wings and a mild moon, Dividing &amp; uniting into many female forms: Jerusalem Trembling! then in one comingling in eternal tears, Sighing to melt his Giant beauty, on the moony river. PLATE 20 But when they saw Albion fall'n upon mild Lambeths vale: Astonish'd! Terrified! they hover'd over his Giant limbs. Then thus Jerusalem spoke, while Vala wove the veil of tears: Weeping in pleadings of Love, in the web of despair. Wherefore hast thou shut me into the winter of human life And clos'd up the sweet regions of youth and virgin innocence: Where we live, forgetting error, not pondering on evil: Among my lambs &amp; brooks of water, among my warbling birds: Where we delight in innocence before the face of the Lamb: Going in and out before him in his love and sweet affection. Vala replied weeping &amp; trembling, hiding in her veil. When winter rends the hungry family and the snow falls: Upon the ways of men hiding the paths of man and beast, Then mourns the wanderer: then he repents his wanderings &amp; eyes The distant forest; then the slave groans in the dungeon of stone. The captive in the mill of the stranger, sold for scanty hire. They view their former life: they number moments over and over; Stringing them on their remembrance as on a thread of sorrow. Thou art my sister and my daughter! thy shame is mine also! Ask me not of my griefs! thou knowest all my griefs. Jerusalem answer'd with soft tears over the valleys. O Vala what is Sin? that thou shudderest and weepest At sight of thy once lov'd Jerusalem! What is Sin but a little Error &amp; fault that is soon forgiven; but mercy is not a Sin Nor pity nor love nor kind forgiveness! O! if I have Sinned Forgive &amp; pity me! O! unfold thy Veil in mercy &amp; love! Slay not my little ones, beloved Virgin daughter of Babylon Slay not my infant loves &amp; graces, beautiful daughter of Moab I cannot put off the human form I strive but strive in vain When Albion rent thy beautiful net of gold and silver twine; Thou hadst woven it with art, thou hadst caught me in the bands Of love; thou refusedst to let me go: Albion beheld thy beauty Beautiful thro' our Love's comeliness, beautiful thro' pity. The Veil shone with thy brightness in the eyes of Albion, Because it inclosd pity &amp; love; because we lov'd one-another! Albion lov'd thee! he rent thy Veil! he embrac'd thee! he lov'd thee! Astonish'd at his beauty &amp; perfection, thou forgavest his furious love: I redounded from Albions bosom in my virgin loveliness. The Lamb of God reciev'd me in his arms he smil'd upon us: He made me his Bride &amp; Wife: he gave thee to Albion. Then was a time of love: O why is it passed away! Then Albion broke silence and with groans reply'd PLATE 21 O Vala! O Jerusalem! do you delight in my groans You O lovely forms, you have prepared my death-cup: The disease of Shame covers me from head to feet: I have no hope Every boil upon my body is a separate &amp; deadly Sin. Doubt first assaild me, then Shame took possession of me Shame divides Families. Shame hath divided Albion in sunder! First fled my Sons, &amp; then my Daughters, then my Wild Animations My Cattle next, last ev'n the Dog of my Gate. the Forests fled The Corn-fields, &amp; the breathing Gardens outside separated The Sea; the Stars: the Sun: the Moon: drivn forth by my disease All is Eternal Death unless you can weave a chaste Body over an unchaste Mind! Vala! O that thou wert pure! That the deep wound of Sin might be clos'd up with the Needle, And with the Loom: to cover Gwendolen &amp; Ragan with costly Robes Of Natural Virtue[,] for their Spiritual forms without a Veil Wither in Luvahs Sepulcher. I thrust him from my presence And all my Children followd his loud howlings into the Deep. Jerusalem! dissembler Jerusalem! I look into thy bosom: I discover thy secret places: Cordella! I behold Thee whom I thought pure as the heavens in innocence &amp; fear: Thy Tabernacle taken down, thy secret Cherubim disclosed Art thou broken? Ah me Sabrina, running by my side: In childhood what wert thou? unutterable anguish! Conwenna Thy cradled infancy is most piteous. O hide, O hide! Their secret gardens were made paths to the traveller: I knew not of their secret loves with those I hated most, Nor that their every thought was Sin &amp; secret appetite[.] Hyle sees in fear, he howls in fury over them, Hand sees In jealous fear: in stern accusation with cruel stripes He drives them thro' the Streets of Babylon before my face: Because they taught Luvah to rise into my clouded heavens Battersea and Chelsea mourn for Cambel &amp; Gwendolen! Hackney and Holloway sicken for Estrild &amp; Ignoge! Because the Peak, Malvern &amp; Cheviot Reason in Cruelty Penmaenmawr &amp; Dhinas-bran Demonstrate in Unbelief Manchester &amp; Liverpool are in tortures of Doubt &amp; Despair Malden &amp; Colchester Demonstrate: I hear my Childrens voices I see their piteous faces gleam out upon the cruel winds From Lincoln &amp; Norwich, from Edinburgh &amp; Monmouth: I see them distant from my bosom scourgd along the roads Then lost in clouds; I hear their tender voices! clouds divide I see them die beneath the whips of the Captains! they are taken In solemn pomp into Chaldea across the bredths of Europe Six months they lie embalmd in silent death: worshipped Carried in Arks of Oak before the armies in the spring Bursting their Arks they rise again to life: they play before The Armies: I hear their loud cymbals &amp; their deadly cries Are the Dead cruel? are those who are infolded in moral Law Revengeful? O that Death &amp; Annihilation were the same! Then Vala answerd spreading her scarlet Veil over Albion PLATE 22 Albion thy fear has made me tremble; thy terrors have surrounded me Thy Sons have naild me on the Gates piercing my hands &amp; feet: Till Skofields Nimrod the mighty Huntsman Jehovah came, With Cush his Son &amp; took me down. He in a golden Ark, Bears me before his Armies tho my shadow hovers here The flesh of multitudes fed &amp; nourisd me in my childhood My morn &amp; evening food were prepard in Battles of Men Great is the cry of the Hounds of Nimrod along the Valley Of Vision, they scent the odor of War in the Valley of Vision. All Love is lost! terror succeeds &amp; Hatred instead of Love And stern demands of Right &amp; Duty instead of Liberty Once thou wast to me the loveliest Son of heaven; but now Where shall I hide from thy dread countenance &amp; searching eyes I have looked into the secret Soul of him I loved And in the dark recesses found Sin &amp; can never return. Albion again utterd his voice beneath the silent Moon I brought Love into light of day to pride in chaste beauty I brought Love into light &amp; fancied Innocence is no more Then spoke Jerusalem O Albion! my Father Albion Why wilt thou number every little fibre of my Soul Spreading them out before the Sun like stalks of flax to dry? The Infant Joy is beautiful, but its anatomy Horrible ghast &amp; deadly! nought shalt thou find in it But dark despair &amp; everlasting brooding melancholy! Then Albion turnd his face toward Jerusalem &amp; spoke Hide thou Jerusalem in impalpable voidness, not to be Touchd by the hand nor seen with the eye: O Jerusalem Would thou wert not &amp; that thy place might never be found But come O Vala with knife &amp; cup: drain my blood To the last drop! then hide me in thy Scarlet Tabernacle For I see Luvah whom I slew. I behold him in my Spectre As I behold Jerusalem in thee O Vala dark and cold Jerusalem then stretchd her hand toward the Moon &amp; spoke Why should Punishment Weave the Veil with Iron Wheels of War When Forgiveness might it Weave with Wings of Cherubim Loud groand Albion from mountain to mountain &amp; replied PLATE 23 Jerusalem! Jerusalem! deluding shadow of Albion! Daughter of my phantasy! unlawful pleasure! Albions curse! I came here with intention to annihilate thee! But My soul is melted away, inwoven within the Veil Hast thou again knitted the Veil of Vala, which I for thee Pitying rent in ancient times. I see it whole and more Perfect, and shining with beauty! But thou! O wretched Father! Jerusalem reply'd, like a voice heard from a sepulcher: Father! once piteous! Is Pity a Sin? Embalm'd in Vala's bosom In an Eternal Death for Albions sake, our best beloved. Thou art my Father &amp; my Brother: Why hast thou hidden me, Remote from the divine Vision: my Lord and Saviour. Trembling stood Albion at her words in jealous dark despair: He felt that Love and Pity are the same; a soft repose! Inward complacency of Soul: a Self-annihilation! I have erred! I am ashamed! and will never return more: I have taught my children sacrifices of cruelty: what shall I answer? I will hide it from Eternals! I will give myself for my Children! Which way soever I turn, I behold Humanity and Pity! He recoil'd: he rush'd outwards; he bore the Veil whole away His fires redound from his Dragon Altars in Errors returning. He drew the Veil of Moral Virtue, woven for Cruel Laws, And cast it into the Atlantic Deep, to catch the Souls of the Dead. He stood between the Palm tree &amp; the Oak of weeping Which stand upon the edge of Beulah; and there Albion sunk Down in sick pallid languor! These were his last words, relapsing! Hoarse from his rocks, from caverns of Derbyshire &amp; Wales And Scotland, utter'd from the Circumference into Eternity. Blasphemous Sons of Feminine delusion! God in the dreary Void Dwells from Eternity, wide separated from the Human Soul But thou deluding Image by whom imbu'd the Veil I rent Lo here is Valas Veil whole, for a Law, a Terror &amp; a Curse! And therefore God takes vengeance on me: from my clay-cold bosom My children wander trembling victims of his Moral Justice. His snows fall on me and cover me, while in the Veil I fold My dying limbs. Therefore O Manhood, if thou art aught But a meer Phantasy, hear dying Albions Curse! May God who dwells in this dark Ulro &amp; voidness, vengeance take, And draw thee down into this Abyss of sorrow and torture, Like me thy Victim. O that Death &amp; Annihilation were the same! PLATE 24 What have I said? What have I done? O all-powerful Human Words! You recoil back upon me in the blood of the Lamb slain in his Children. Two bleeding Contraries equally true, are his Witnesses against me We reared mighty Stones: we danced naked around them: Thinking to bring Love into light of day, to Jerusalems shame: Displaying our Giant limbs to all the winds of heaven! Sudden Shame siezd us, we could not look on one-another for abhorrence: the Blue Of our immortal Veins &amp; all their Hosts fled from our Limbs, And wanderd distant in a dismal Night clouded &amp; dark: The Sun fled from the Britons forehead: the Moon from his mighty loins: Scandinavia fled with all his mountains filld with groans. O what is Life &amp; what is Man. O what is Death? Wherefore Are you my Children, natives in the Grave to where I go Or are you born to feed the hungry ravenings of Destruction To be the sport of Accident! to waste in Wrath &amp; Love, a weary Life, in brooding cares &amp; anxious labours, that prove but chaff. O Jerusalem Jerusalem I have forsaken thy Courts Thy Pillars of ivory &amp; gold: thy Curtains of silk &amp; fine Linen: thy Pavements of precious stones: thy Walls of pearl And gold, thy Gates of Thanksgiving thy Windows of Praise: Thy Clouds of Blessing; thy Cherubims of Tender-mercy Stretching their Wings sublime over the Little-ones of Albion[.] O Human Imagination O Divine Body I have Crucified I have turned my back upon thee into the Wastes of Moral Law: There Babylon is builded in the Waste, founded in Human desolation. O Babylon thy Watchman stands over thee in the night Thy severe Judge all the day long proves thee O Babylon With provings of destruction, with giving thee thy hearts desire. But Albion is cast forth to the Potter his Children to the Builders To build Babylon because they have forsaken Jerusalem The Walls of Babylon are Souls of Men: her Gates the Groans Of Nations: her Towers are the Miseries of once happy Families. Her Streets are paved with Destruction, her Houses built with Death Her Palaces with Hell &amp; the Grave; her Synagogues with Torments Of ever-hardening Despair squard &amp; polishd with cruel skill Yet thou wast lovely as the summer cloud upon my hills When Jerusalem was thy hearts desire in times of youth &amp; love. Thy Sons came to Jerusalem with gifts, she sent them away With blessings on their hands &amp; on their feet, blessings of gold, And pearl &amp; diamond: thy Daughters sang in her Courts: They came up to Jerusalem; they walked before Albion In the Exchanges of London every Nation walkd And London walkd in every Nation mutual in love &amp; harmony Albion coverd the whole Earth, England encompassd the Nations, Mutual each within others bosom in Visions of Regeneration; Jerusalem coverd the Atlantic Mountains &amp; the Erythrean, From bright Japan &amp; China to Hesperia France &amp; England. Mount Zion lifted his head in every Nation under heaven: And the Mount of Olives was beheld over the whole Earth: The footsteps of the Lamb of God were there: but now no more No more shall I behold him, he is closd in Luvahs Sepulcher. Yet why these smitings of Luvah, the gentlest mildest Zoa? If God was Merciful this could not be: O Lamb of God Thou art a delusion and Jerusalem is my Sin! O my Children I have educated you in the crucifying cruelties of Demonstration Till you have assum'd the Providence of God &amp; slain your Father Dost thou appear before me who liest dead in Luvahs Sepulcher Dost thou forgive me! thou who wast Dead &amp; art Alive? Look not so merciful upon me O thou Slain Lamb of God I die! I die in thy arms tho Hope is banishd from me. Thundring the Veil rushes from his hand Vegetating Knot by Knot, Day by Day, Night by Night; loud roll the indignant Atlantic Waves &amp; the Erythrean, turning up the bottoms of the Deeps PLATE 25 And there was heard a great lamenting in Beulah: all the Regions Of Beulah were moved as the tender bowels are moved: &amp; they said: Why did you take Vengeance O ye Sons of the mighty Albion? Planting these Oaken Groves: Erecting these Dragon Temples Injury the Lord heals but Vengeance cannot be healed: As the Sons of Albion have done to Luvah: so they have in him Done to the Divine Lord &amp; Saviour, who suffers with those that suffer: For not one sparrow can suffer, &amp; the whole Universe not suffer also, In all its Regions, &amp; its Father &amp; Saviour not pity and weep. But Vengeance is the destroyer of Grace &amp; Repentance in the bosom Of the Injurer: in which the Divine Lamb is cruelly slain: Descend O Lamb of God &amp; take away the imputation of Sin By the Creation of States &amp; the deliverance of Individuals Evermore Amen Thus wept they in Beulah over the Four Regions of Albion But many doubted &amp; despaird &amp; imputed Sin &amp; Righteousness To Individuals &amp; not to States, and these Slept in Ulro. PLATE 26 SUCH VISIONS HAVE APPEARD TO ME AS I MY ORDERD RACE HAVE RUN JERUSALEM IS NAMED LIBERTY AMONG THE SONS OF ALBION PLATE 27 To the Jews. Jerusalem the Emanation of the Giant Albion! Can it be? Is it a Truth that the Learned have explored? Was Britain the Primitive Seat of the Patriarchal Religion? If it is true: my title-page is also True, that Jerusalem was &amp; is the Emanation of the Giant Albion. It is True, and cannot be controverted. Ye are united O ye Inhabitants of Earth in One Religion. The Religion of Jesus: the most Ancient, the Eternal: &amp; the Everlasting Gospel—The Wicked will turn it to Wickedness, the Righteous to Righteousness. Amen! Huzza! Selah! “All things Begin &amp; End in Albions Ancient Druid Rocky Shore.” Your Ancestors derived their origin from Abraham, Heber, Shem, and Noah, who were Druids: as the Druid Temples (which are the Patriarchal Pillars &amp; Oak Groves) over the whole Earth witness to this day. You have a tradition, that Man anciently containd in his mighty limbs all things in Heaven &amp; Earth: this you recieved from the Druids. “But now the Starry Heavens are fled from the mighty limbs of Albion” Albion was the Parent of the Druids; &amp; in his Chaotic State of Sleep[,] Satan &amp; Adam &amp; the whole World was Created by the Elohim. The fields from Islington to Marybone, To Primrose Hill and Saint Johns Wood: Were builded over with pillars of gold, And there Jerusalems pillars stood. Her Little-ones ran on the fields The Lamb of God among them seen And fair Jerusalem his Bride: Among the little meadows green. Pancrass &amp; Kentish-town repose Among her golden pillars high: Among her golden arches which Shine upon the starry sky. The Jews-harp-house &amp; the Green Man; The Ponds where Boys to bathe delight: The fields of Cows by Willans farm: Shine in Jerusalems pleasant sight. She walks upon our meadows green: The Lamb of God walks by her side: And every English Child is seen, Children of Jesus &amp; his Bride, Forgiving trespasses and sins Lest Babylon with cruel Og, With Moral &amp; Self-righteous Law Should Crucify in Satans Synagogue! What are those golden Builders doing Near mournful ever-weeping Paddington Standing above that mighty Ruin Where Satan the first victory won. Where Albion slept beneath the Fatal Tree And the Druids golden Knife, Rioted in human gore, In Offerings of Human Life They groan'd aloud on London Stone They groan'd aloud on Tyburns Brook Albion gave his deadly groan, And all the Atlantic Mountains shook Albions Spectre from his Loins Tore forth in all the pomp of War! Satan his name: in flames of fire He stretch'd his Druid Pillars far. Jerusalem fell from Lambeth's Vale, Down thro Poplar &amp; Old Bow; Thro Malden &amp; acros the Sea, In War &amp; howling death &amp; woe. The Rhine was red with human blood: The Danube rolld a purple tide: On the Euphrates Satan stood: And over Asia stretch'd his pride. He witherd up sweet Zions Hill, From every Nation of the Earth: He witherd up Jerusalems Gates, And in a dark Land gave her birth. He witherd up the Human Form, By laws of sacrifice for sin: Till it became a Mortal Worm: But O! translucent all within. The Divine Vision still was seen Still was the Human Form, Divine Weeping in weak &amp; mortal clay O Jesus still the Form was thine. And thine the Human Face &amp; thine The Human Hands &amp; Feet &amp; Breath Entering thro' the Gates of Birth And passing thro' the Gates of Death And O thou Lamb of God, whom I Slew in my dark self-righteous pride: Art thou return'd to Albions Land! And is Jerusalem thy Bride? Come to my arms &amp; never more Depart; but dwell for ever here: Create my Spirit to thy Love: Subdue my Spectre to thy Fear. Spectre of Albion! warlike Fiend! In clouds of blood &amp; ruin roll'd: I here reclaim thee as my own My Selfhood! Satan! armd in gold. Is this thy soft Family-Love Thy cruel Patriarchal pride Planting thy Family alone, Destroying all the World beside. A mans worst enemies are those Of his own house &amp; family; And he who makes his law a curse, By his own law shall surely die. In my Exchanges every Land Shall walk, &amp; mine in every Land, Mutual shall build Jerusalem: Both heart in heart &amp; hand in hand. If Humility is Christianity; you O Jews are the true Christians; If your tradition that Man contained in his Limbs, all Animals, is True &amp; they were separated from him by cruel Sacrifices: and when compulsory cruel Sacrifices had brought Humanity into a Feminine Tabernacle, in the loins of Abraham &amp; David: the Lamb of God, the Saviour became apparent on Earth as the Prophets had foretold? The Return of Israel is a Return to Mental Sacrifice &amp; War. Take up the Cross O Israel &amp; follow Jesus. PLATE 28 Chap: 2. Every ornament of perfection, and every labour of love, In all the Garden of Eden, &amp; in all the golden mountains Was become an envied horror, and a remembrance of jealousy: And every Act a Crime, and Albion the punisher &amp; judge. And Albion spoke from his secret seat and said All these ornaments are crimes, they are made by the labours Of loves: of unnatural consanguinities and friendships Horrid to think of when enquired deeply into; and all These hills &amp; valleys are accursed witnesses of Sin I therefore condense them into solid rocks, stedfast! A foundation and certainty and demonstrative truth: That Man be separate from Man, &amp; here I plant my seat. Cold snows drifted around him: ice coverd his loins around He sat by Tyburns brook, and underneath his heel, shot up! A deadly Tree, he nam'd it Moral Virtue, and the Law Of God who dwells in Chaos hidden from the human sight. The Tree spread over him its cold shadows, (Albion groand) They bent down, they felt the earth and again enrooting Shot into many a Tree! an endless labyrinth of woe! From willing sacrifice of Self, to sacrifice of (miscall'd) Enemies For Atonement: Albion began to erect twelve Altars, Of rough unhewn rocks, before the Potters Furnace He nam'd them Justice, and Truth. And Albions Sons Must have become the first Victims, being the first transgressors But they fled to the mountains to seek ransom: building A Strong Fortification against the Divine Humanity and Mercy, In Shame &amp; Jealousy to annihilate Jerusalem! PLATE 29 [33] Turning his back to the Divine Vision, his Spectrous Chaos before his face appeard: an Unformed Memory. Then spoke the Spectrous Chaos to Albion darkning cold From the back &amp; loins where dwell the Spectrous Dead I am your Rational Power O Albion &amp; that Human Form You call Divine, is but a Worm seventy inches long That creeps forth in a night &amp; is dried in the morning sun In fortuitous concourse of memorys accumulated &amp; lost It plows the Earth in its own conceit, it overwhelms the Hills Beneath its winding labyrinths, till a stone of the brook Stops it in midst of its pride among its hills &amp; rivers[.] Battersea &amp; Chelsea mourn, London &amp; Canterbury tremble Their place shall not be found as the wind passes over[.] The ancient Cities of the Earth remove as a traveller And shall Albions Cities remain when I pass over them With my deluge of forgotten remembrances over the tablet So spoke the Spectre to Albion. he is the Great Selfhood Satan: Worshipd as God by the Mighty Ones of the Earth Having a white Dot calld a Center from which branches out A Circle in continual gyrations. this became a Heart From which sprang numerous branches varying their motions Producing many Heads three or seven or ten, &amp; hands &amp; feet Innumerable at will of the unfortunate contemplator Who becomes his food[:] such is the way of the Devouring Power And this is the cause of the appearance in the frowning Chaos[.] Albions Emanation which he had hidden in Jealousy Appeard now in the frowning Chaos prolific upon the Chaos Reflecting back to Albion in Sexual Reasoning Hermaphroditic Albion spoke. Who art thou that appearest in gloomy pomp Involving the Divine Vision in colours of autumn ripeness I never saw thee till this time, nor beheld life abstracted Nor darkness immingled with light on my furrowd field Whence camest thou! who art thou O loveliest? the Divine Vision Is as nothing before thee, faded is all life and joy Vala replied in clouds of tears Albions garment embracing I was a City &amp; a Temple built by Albions Children. I was a Garden planted with beauty I allured on hill &amp; valley The River of Life to flow against my walls &amp; among my trees Vala was Albions Bride &amp; Wife in great Eternity The loveliest of the daughters of Eternity when in day-break I emanated from Luvah over the Towers of Jerusalem And in her Courts among her little Children offering up The Sacrifice of fanatic love! why loved I Jerusalem! Why was I one with her embracing in the Vision of Jesus Wherefore did I loving create love, which never yet Immingled God &amp; Man, when thou &amp; I, hid the Divine Vision In cloud of secret gloom which behold involve me round about Know me now Albion: look upon me I alone am Beauty The Imaginative Human Form is but a breathing of Vala I breathe him forth into the Heaven from my secret Cave Born of the Woman to obey the Woman O Albion the mighty For the Divine appearance is Brotherhood, but I am Love PLATE 30 [34] Elevate into the Region of Brotherhood with my red fires Art thou Vala? replied Albion, image of my repose O how I tremble! how my members pour down milky fear! A dewy garment covers me all over, all manhood is gone! At thy word &amp; at thy look death enrobes me about From head to feet, a garment of death &amp; eternal fear Is not that Sun thy husband &amp; that Moon thy glimmering Veil? Are not the Stars of heaven thy Children! art thou not Babylon? Art thou Nature Mother of all! is Jerusalem thy Daughter Why have thou elevate inward: O dweller of outward chambers From grot &amp; cave beneath the Moon dim region of death Where I laid my Plow in the hot noon, where my hot team fed Where implements of War are forged, the Plow to go over the Nations In pain girding me round like a rib of iron in heaven! O Vala In Eternity they neither marry nor are given in marriage Albion the high Cliff of the Atlantic is become a barren Land Los stood at his Anvil: he heard the contentions of Vala— He heavd his thundring Bellows upon the valleys of Middlesex He opend his Furnaces before Vala, then Albion frownd in anger On his Rock: ere yet the Starry Heavens were fled away From his awful Members, and thus Los cried aloud To the Sons of Albion &amp; to Hand the eldest Son of Albion I hear the screech of Childbirth loud pealing, &amp; the groans Of Death, in Albions clouds dreadful utterd over all the Earth What may Man be? who can tell! but what may Woman be? To have power over Man from Cradle to corruptible Grave. There is a Throne in every Man, it is the Throne of God This Woman has claimd as her own &amp; Man is no more! Albion is the Tabernacle of Vala &amp; her Temple And not the Tabernacle &amp; Temple of the Most High O Albion why wilt thou Create a Female Will? To hide the most evident God in a hidden covert, even In the shadows of a Woman &amp; a secluded Holy Place That we may pry after him as after a stolen treasure Hidden among the Dead &amp; mured up from the paths of life Hand! art thou not Reuben enrooting thyself into Bashan Till thou remainest a vaporous Shadow in a Void! O Merlin! Unknown among the Dead where never before Existence came Is this the Female Will O ye lovely Daughters of Albion. To Converse concerning Weight &amp; Distance in the Wilds of Newton &amp; Locke So Los spoke standing on Mam-Tor looking over Europe &amp; Asia The Graves thunder beneath his feet from Ireland to Japan Reuben slept in Bashan like one dead in the valley Cut off from Albions mountains &amp; from all the Earths summits Between Succoth &amp; Zaretan beside the Stone of Bohan While the Daughters of Albion divided Luvah into three Bodies Los bended his Nostrils down to the Earth, then sent him over Jordan to the Land of the Hittite: every-one that saw him Fled! they fled at his horrible Form: they hid in caves And dens, they looked on one-another &amp; became what they beheld Reuben return'd to Bashan, in despair he slept on the Stone. Then Gwendolen divided into Rahab &amp; Tirza in Twelve Portions[.] Los rolled, his Eyes into two narrow circles, then sent him Over Jordan; all terrified fled: they became what they beheld. If Perceptive Organs vary: Objects of Perception seem to vary: If the Perceptive Organs close: their Objects seem to close also: Consider this O mortal Man! O worm of sixty winters said Los Consider Sexual Organization &amp; hide thee in the dust. PLATE 31 [35] Then the Divine hand found the Two Limits, Satan and Adam, In Albions bosom: for in every Human bosom those Limits stand. And the Divine voice came from the Furnaces, as multitudes without Number! the voices of the innumerable multitudes of Eternity. And the appearance of a Man was seen in the Furnaces; Saving those who have sinned from the punishment of the Law, (In pity of the punisher whose state is eternal death,) And keeping them from Sin by the mild counsels of his love. Albion goes to Eternal Death: In Me all Eternity. Must pass thro' condemnation, and awake beyond the Grave! No individual can keep these Laws, for they are death To every energy of man, and forbid the springs of life; Albion hath enterd the State Satan! Be permanent O State! And be thou for ever accursed! that Albion may arise again: And be thou created into a State! I go forth to Create States: to deliver Individuals evermore! Amen. So spoke the voice from the Furnaces, descending into Non-Entity [To Govern the Evil by Good: and States abolish Systems.] PLATE 32 [36] Reuben return'd to his place, in vain he sought beautiful Tirzah For his Eyelids were narrowd, &amp; his Nostrils scented the ground And Sixty Winters Los raged in the Divisions of Reuben: Building the Moon of Ulro, plank by plank &amp; rib by rib Reuben slept in the Cave of Adam, and Los folded his Tongue Between Lips of mire &amp; clay, then sent him forth over Jordan In the love of Tirzah he said Doubt is my food day &amp; night— All that beheld him fled howling and gnawed their tongues For pain: they became what they beheld. In reasonings Reuben returned To Heshbon. disconsolate he walkd thro Moab &amp; he stood Before the Furnaces of Los in a horrible dreamful slumber, On Mount Gilead looking toward Gilgal: and Los bended His Ear in a spiral circle outward; then sent him over Jordan. The Seven Nations fled before him they became what they beheld Hand, Hyle &amp; Coban fled: they became what they beheld Gwantock &amp; Peachy hid in Damascus beneath Mount Lebanon Brereton &amp; Slade in Egypt. Hutton &amp; Skofeld &amp; Kox Fled over Chaldea in terror in pains in every nerve Kotope &amp; Bowen became what they beheld, fleeing over the Earth And the Twelve Female Emanations fled with them agonizing. Jerusalem trembled seeing her Children drivn by Los's Hammer In the visions of the dreams of Beulah on the edge of Non-Entity[.] Hand stood between Reuben &amp; Merlin, as the Reasoning Spectre Stands between the Vegetative Man &amp; his Immortal Imagination And the Four Zoa's clouded rage East &amp; West &amp; North &amp; South They change their situations, in the Universal Man. Albion groans, he sees the Elements divide before his face! And England who is Brittannia divided into Jersualem &amp; Vala And Urizen assumes the East, Luvah assumes the South In his dark Spectre ravening from his open Sepulcher And the Four Zoa's who are the Four Eternal Senses of Man Became Four Elements separating from the Limbs of Albion These are their names in the Vegetative Generation [West Weighing East &amp; North dividing Generation South [?]ing] And Accident &amp; Chance were found hidden in Length Bredth &amp; Highth And they divided into Four ravening deathlike Forms Fairies &amp; Genii &amp; Nymphs &amp; Gnomes of the Elements. These are States Permanently Fixed by the Divine Power[.] The Atlantic Continent sunk round Albions cliffy shore And the Sea poured in amain upon the Giants of Albion As Los bended the Senses of Reuben Reuben is Merlin Exploring the Three States of Ulro; Creation; Redemption. &amp; Judgment And many of the Eternal Ones laughed after their manner Have you known the Judgment that is arisen among the Zoa's of Albion? where a Man dare hardly to embrace His own Wife, for the terrors of Chastity that they call By the name of Morality. their Daughters govern all In hidden deceit! they are Vegetable only fit for burning: Art &amp; Science cannot exist but by Naked Beauty displayd Then those in Great Eternity who contemplate on Death Said thus. What seems to Be: Is: To those to whom It seems to Be, &amp; is productive of the most dreadful Consequences to those to whom it seems to Be: even of Torments, Despair, Eternal Death; but the Divine Mercy Steps beyond and Redeems Man in the Body of Jesus Amen And Length Bredth Highth again Obey the Divine Vision Hallelujah PLATE 33 [37] And One stood forth from the Divine family &amp; said I feel my Spectre rising upon me! Albion! arouze thyself! Why dost thou thunder with frozen Spectrous wrath against us? The Spectre is, in Giant Man; insane, and most deform'd. Thou wilt certainly provoke my Spectre against thine in fury! He has a Sepulcher hewn out of a Rock ready for thee: And a Death of Eight thousand years, forg'd by thyself, upon The point of his Spear! if thou persistest to forbid with Laws Our Emanations, and to attack our secret supreme delights So Los spoke: But when he saw blue death in Albions feet, Again he join'd the Divine Body, following merciful; While Albion fled more indignant! revengeful covering PLATE 34 [38] His face and bosom with petrific hardness, and his hands And feet, lest any should enter his bosom &amp; embrace His hidden heart; his Emanation wept &amp; trembled within him: Uttering not his jealousy, but hiding it as with Iron and steel, dark and opake, with clouds &amp; tempests brooding: His strong limbs shudderd upon his mountains high and dark. Turning from Universal Love petrific as he went, His cold against the warmth of Eden rag'd with loud Thunders of deadly war (the fever of the human soul) Fires and clouds of rolling smoke! but mild the Saviour follow'd him, Displaying the Eternal Vision! the Divine Similitude! In loves and tears of brothers, sisters, sons, fathers, and friends Which if Man ceases to behold, he ceases to exist: Saying. Albion! Our wars are wars of life, &amp; wounds of love, With intellectual spears, &amp; long winged arrows of thought: Mutual in one anothers love and wrath all renewing We live as One Man; for contracting our infinite senses We behold multitude; or expanding: we behold as one, As One Man all the Universal Family; and that One Man We call Jesus the Christ: and he in us, and we in him, Live in perfect harmony in Eden the land of life, Giving, recieving, and forgiving each others trespasses. He is the Good shepherd, he is the Lord and master: He is the Shepherd of Albion, he is all in all, In Eden: in the garden of God: and in heavenly Jerusalem. If we have offended, forgive us, take not vengeance against us. Thus speaking; the Divine Family follow Albion: I see them in the Vision of God upon my pleasant valleys. I behold London; a Human awful wonder of God! He says: Return, Albion, return! I give myself for thee: My Streets are my, Ideas of Imagination. Awake Albion, awake! and let us awake up together. My Houses are Thoughts: my Inhabitants; Affections, The children of my thoughts, walking within my blood-vessels, Shut from my nervous form which sleeps upon the verge of Beulah In dreams of darkness, while my vegetating blood in veiny pipes, Rolls dreadful thro' the Furnaces of Los, and the Mills of Satan. For Albions sake, and for Jerusalem thy Emanation I give myself, and these my brethren give themselves for Albion. So spoke London, immortal Guardian! I heard in Lambeths shades: In Felpham I heard and saw the Visions of Albion I write in South Molton Street, what I both see and hear In regions of Humanity, in Londons opening streets. I see thee awful Parent Land in light, behold I see! Verulam! Canterbury! venerable parent of men, Generous immortal Guardian golden clad! for Cities Are Men, fathers of multitudes, and Rivers &amp; Mountains Are also Men; every thing is Human, mighty! sublime! In every bosom a Universe expands, as wings Let down at will around, and call'd the Universal Tent. York, crown'd with loving kindness. Edinburgh, cloth'd With fortitude as with a garment of immortal texture Woven in looms of Eden, in spiritual deaths of mighty men Who give themselves, in Golgotha, Victims to Justice; where There is in Albion a Gate of Precious stones and gold Seen only by Emanations, by vegetations viewless, Bending across the road of Oxford Street; it from Hyde Park To Tyburns deathful shades, admits the wandering souls Of multitudes who die from Earth: this Gate cannot be found PLATE 35 [39] By Satans Watch-fiends tho' they search numbering every grain Of sand on Earth every night, they never find this Gate. It is the Gate of Los. Withoutside is the Mill, intricate, dreadful And fill'd with cruel tortures; but no mortal man can find the Mill Of Satan, in his mortal pilgrimage of seventy years For Human beauty knows it not: nor can Mercy find it! But In the Fourth region of Humanity, Urthona namd[,] Mortality begins to roll the billows of Eternal Death Before the Gate of Los. Urthona here is named Los. And here begins the System of Moral Virtue, named Rahab. Albion fled thro' the Gate of Los, and he stood in the Gate. Los was the friend of Albion who most lov'd him. In Cambridgeshire His eternal station, he is the twenty-eighth, &amp; is four-fold. Seeing Albion had turn'd his back against the Divine Vision, Los said to Albion. Whither fleest thou? Albion reply'd. I die! I go to Eternal Death! the shades of death Hover within me &amp; beneath, and spreading themselves outside Like rocky clouds, build me a gloomy monument of woe: Will none accompany me in my death? or be a Ransom for me In that dark Valley? I have girded round my cloke, and on my feet Bound these black shoes of death, &amp; on my hands, deaths iron gloves: God hath forsaken me, &amp; my friends are become a burden A weariness to me, &amp; the human footstep is a terror to me. Los answerd, troubled: and his soul was rent in twain: Must the Wise die for an Atonement? does Mercy endure Atonement? No! It is Moral Severity, &amp; destroys Mercy in its Victim. So speaking, not yet infected with the Error &amp; Illusion, PLATE 36 [40] Los shudder'd at beholding Albion, for his disease Arose upon him pale and ghastly: and he call'd around The Friends of Albion: trembling at the sight of Eternal Death The four appear'd with their Emanations in fiery Chariots: black their fires roll beholding Albions House of Eternity Damp couch the flames beneath and silent, sick, stand shuddering Before the Porch of sixteen pillars: weeping every one Descended and fell down upon their knees round Albions knees, Swearing the Oath of God! with awful voice of thunders round Upon the hills &amp; valleys, and the cloudy Oath roll'd far and wide Albion is sick! said every Valley, every mournful Hill And every River: our brother Albion is sick to death. He hath leagued himself with robbers! he hath studied the arts Of unbelief! Envy hovers over him! his Friends are his abhorrence! Those who give their lives for him are despised! Those who devour his soul, are taken into his bosom! To destroy his Emanation is their intention: Arise! awake O Friends of the Giant Albion They have perswaded him of horrible falshoods! They have sown errors over all his fruitful fields! The Twenty-four heard! they came trembling on watry chariots. Borne by the Living Creatures of the third procession Of Human Majesty, the Living Creatures wept aloud as they Went along Albions roads, till they arriv'd at Albions House. O! how the torments of Eternal Death, waited on Man: And the loud-rending bars of the Creation ready to burst: That the wide world might fly from its hinges, &amp; the immortal mansion Of Man, for ever be possessd by monsters of the deeps: And Man himself become a Fiend, wrap'd in an endless curse, Consuming and consum'd for-ever in flames of Moral Justice. For had the Body of Albion fall'n down, and from its dreadful ruins Let loose the enormous Spectre on the darkness of the deep, At enmity with the Merciful &amp; fill'd with devouring fire, A nether-world must have recievd the foul enormous spirit, Under pretence of Moral Virtue, fill'd with Revenge and Law. There to eternity chain'd down, and issuing in red flames And curses, with his mighty arms brandish'd against the heavens Breathing cruelty blood &amp; vengeance, gnashing his teeth with pain Torn with black storms, &amp; ceaseless torrents of his own consuming fire: Within his breast his mighty Sons chaind down &amp; fill'd with cursings: And his dark Eon, that once fair crystal form divinely clear: Within his ribs producing serpents whose souls are flames of fire. But, glory to the Merciful-One, for he is of tender mercies! And the Divine Family wept over him as One Man. And these the Twenty-four in whom the Divine Family Appeard; and they were One in Him. A Human Vision! Human Divine, Jesus the Saviour, blessed for ever and ever. Selsey, true friend! who afterwards submitted to be devourd By the waves of Despair, whose Emanation rose above The flood, and was nam'd Chichester, lovely mild &amp; gentle! Lo! Her lambs bleat to the sea-fowls cry, lamenting still for Albion. Submitting to be call'd the son of Los the terrible vision: Winchester stood devoting himself for Albion: his tents Outspread with abundant riches, and his Emanations Submitting to be call'd Enitharmons daughters, and be born In vegetable mould: created by the Hammer and Loom In Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda where the Dead wail night &amp; day. (I call them by their English names: English, the rough basement. Los built the stubborn structure of the Language, acting against Albions melancholy, who must else have been a Dumb despair.) Gloucester and Exeter and Salisbury and Bristol: and benevolent Bath PLATE 37 [41] Bath who is Legions: he is the Seventh, the physician and The poisoner: the best and worst in Heaven and Hell: Whose Spectre first assimilated with Luvah in Albions mountains A triple octave he took, to reduce Jerusalem to twelve To cast Jerusalem forth upon the wilds to Poplar &amp; Bow: To Malden &amp; Canterbury in the delights of cruelty: The Shuttles of death sing in the sky to Islington &amp; Pancrass Round Marybone to Tyburns River, weaving black melancholy as a net, And despair as meshes closely wove over the west of London, Where mild Jerusalem sought to repose in death &amp; be no more. She fled to Lambeths mild Vale and hid herself beneath The Surrey Hills where Rephaim terminates: her Sons are siez'd For victims of sacrifice; but Jerusalem cannot be found! Hid By the Daughters of Beulah: gently snatch'd away: and hid in Beulah There is a Grain of Sand in Lambeth that Satan cannot find Nor can his Watch Fiends find it: tis translucent &amp; has many Angles But he who finds it will find Oothoons palace, for within Opening into Beulah every angle is a lovely heaven But should the Watch Fiends find it, they would call it Sin And lay its Heavens &amp; their inhabitants in blood of punishment Here Jerusalem &amp; Vala were hid in soft slumberous repose Hid from the terrible East, shut up in the South &amp; West. The Twenty-eight trembled in Deaths dark caves, in cold despair They kneeld around the Couch of Death in deep humiliation And tortures of self condemnation while their Spectres ragd within. The Four Zoa's in terrible combustion clouded rage Drinking the shuddering fears &amp; loves of Albions Families Destroying by selfish affections the things that they most admire Drinking &amp; eating, &amp; pitying &amp; weeping, as at a tragic scene. The soul drinks murder &amp; revenge, &amp; applauds its own holiness They saw Albion endeavouring to destroy their Emanations. PLATE 38 [43] They saw their Wheels rising up poisonous against Albion Urizen, cold &amp; scientific: Luvah, pitying &amp; weeping Tharmas, indolent &amp; sullen: Urthona, doubting &amp; despairing Victims to one another &amp; dreadfully plotting against each other To prevent Albion walking about in the Four Complexions. They saw America clos'd out by the Oaks of the western shore; And Tharmas dash'd on the Rocks of the Altars of Victims in Mexico. If we are wrathful Albion will destroy Jerusalem with rooty Groves If we are merciful, ourselves must suffer destruction on his Oaks! Why should we enter into our Spectres, to behold our own corruptions O God of Albion descend! deliver Jerusalem from the Oaken Groves! Then Los grew furious raging: Why stand we here trembling around Calling on God for help; and not ourselves in whom God dwells Stretching a hand to save the falling Man: are we not Four Beholding Albion upon the Precipice ready to fall into Non-Entity: Seeing these Heavens &amp; Hells conglobing in the Void. Heavens over Hells Brooding in holy hypocritic lust, drinking the cries of pain From howling victims of Law: building Heavens Twenty-seven-fold. Swelld &amp; bloated General Forms, repugnant to the Divine- Humanity, who is the Only General and Universal Form To which all Lineaments tend &amp; seek with love &amp; sympathy All broad &amp; general principles belong to benevolence Who protects minute particulars, every one in their own identity. But here the affectionate touch of the tongue is closd in by deadly teeth And the soft smile of friendship &amp; the open dawn of benevolence Become a net &amp; a trap, &amp; every energy renderd cruel, Till the existence of friendship &amp; benevolence is denied: The wine of the Spirit &amp; the vineyards of the Holy-One. Here: turn into poisonous stupor &amp; deadly intoxication: That they may be condemnd by Law &amp; the Lamb of God be slain! And the two Sources of Life in Eternity[,] Hunting and War, Are become the Sources of dark &amp; bitter Death &amp; of corroding Hell: The open heart is shut up in integuments of frozen silence That the spear that lights it forth may shatter the ribs &amp; bosom A pretence of Art, to destroy Art: a pretence of Liberty To destroy Liberty. a pretence of Religion to destroy Religion Oshea and Caleb fight: they contend in the valleys of Peor In the terrible Family Contentions of those who love each other: The Armies of Balaam weep—no women come to the field Dead corses lay before them, &amp; not as in Wars of old. For the Soldier who fights for Truth, calls his enemy his brother: They fight &amp; contend for life, &amp; not for eternal death! But here the Soldier strikes, &amp; a dead corse falls at his feet Nor Daughter nor Sister nor Mother come forth to embosom the Slain! But Death! Eternal Death! remains in the Valleys of Peor. The English are scatterd over the face of the Nations: are these Jerusalems children? Hark! hear the Giants of Albion cry at night We smell the blood of the English! we delight in their blood on our Altars! The living &amp; the dead shall be ground in our rumbling Mills For bread of the Sons of Albion: of the Giants Hand &amp; Scofield Scofeld &amp; Kox are let loose upon my Saxons! they accumulate A World in which Man is by his Nature the Enemy of Man, In pride of Selfhood unwieldy stretching out into Non Entity Generalizing Art &amp; Science till Art &amp; Science is lost. Bristol &amp; Bath, listen to my words, &amp; ye Seventeen: give ear! It is easy to acknowledge a man to be great &amp; good while we Derogate from him in the trifles &amp; small articles of that goodness: Those alone are his friends, who admire his minutest powers[.] Instead of Albions lovely mountains &amp; the curtains of Jerusalem I see a Cave, a Rock, a Tree deadly and poisonous, unimaginative: Instead of the Mutual Forgivenesses, the Minute Particulars, I see Pits of bitumen ever burning: artificial Riches of the Canaanite Like Lakes of liquid lead: instead of heavenly Chapels, built By our dear Lord: I see Worlds crusted with snows &amp; ice; I see a Wicker Idol woven round Jerusalems children. I see The Canaanite, the Amalekite, the Moabite, the Egyptian: By Demonstrations the cruel Sons of Quality &amp; Negation. Driven on the Void in incoherent despair into Non Entity I see America closd apart, &amp; Jerusalem driven in terror Away from Albions mountains, far away from Londons spires! I will not endure this thing! I alone withstand to death, This outrage! Ah me! how sick &amp; pale you all stand round me! Ah me! pitiable ones! do you also go to deaths vale? All you my Friends &amp; Brothers! all you my beloved Companions! Have you also caught the infection of Sin &amp; stern Repentance? I see Disease arise upon you! yet speak to me and give Me some comfort: why do you all stand silent? I alone Remain in permanent strength. Or is all this goodness &amp; pity, only That you may take the greater vengeance in your Sepulcher. So Los spoke. Pale they stood around the House of Death: In the midst of temptations &amp; despair: among the rooted Oaks: Among reared Rocks of Albions Sons, at length they rose PLATE 39 [44] With one accord in love sublime, &amp; as on Cherubs wings They Albion surround with kindest violence to bear him back Against his will thro Los's Gate to Eden: Four-fold; loud! Their Wings waving over the bottomless Immense: to bear Their awful charge back to his native home: but Albion dark, Repugnant; rolld his Wheels backward into Non-Entity Loud roll the Starry Wheels of Albion into the World of Death And all the Gate of Los, clouded with clouds redounding from Albions dread Wheels, stretching out spaces immense between That every little particle of light &amp; air, became Opake Black &amp; immense, a Rock of difficulty &amp; a Cliff Of black despair; that the immortal Wings labourd against Cliff after cliff, &amp; over Valleys of despair &amp; death: The narrow Sea between Albion &amp; the Atlantic Continent: Its waves of pearl became a boundless Ocean bottomless, Of grey obscurity, filld with clouds &amp; rocks &amp; whirling waters And Albions Sons ascending &amp; descending in the horrid Void. But as the Will must not be bended but in the day of Divine Power: silent calm &amp; motionless, in the mid-air sublime, The Family Divine hover around the darkend Albion. Such is the nature of the Ulro: that whatever enters: Becomes Sexual, &amp; is Created, and Vegetated, and Born. From Hyde Park spread their vegetating roots beneath Albion In dreadful pain the Spectrous Uncircumcised Vegetation.— Forming a Sexual Machine: an Aged Virgin Form. In Erins Land toward the north, joint after joint &amp; burning In love &amp; jealousy immingled &amp; calling it Religion And feeling the damps of death they with one accord delegated Los Conjuring him by the Highest that he should Watch over them Till Jesus shall appear: &amp; they gave their power to Los Naming him the Spirit of Prophecy, calling him Elijah Strucken with Albions disease they become what they behold; They assimilate with Albion in pity &amp; compassion; Their Emanations return not: their Spectres rage in the Deep The Slumbers of Death came over them around the Couch of Death Before the Gate of Los &amp; in the depths of Non Entity Among the Furnaces of Los: among the Oaks of Albion. Man is adjoind to Man by his Emanative portion: Who is Jerusalem in every individual Man: and her Shadow is Vala, builded by the Reasoning power in Man O search &amp; see: turn your eyes inward: open O thou World Of Love &amp; Harmony in Man: expand thy ever lovely Gates. They wept into the deeps a little space at length was heard The voice of Bath, faint as the voice of the Dead in the House of Death PLATE 40 [45] Bath, healing City! whose wisdom in midst of Poetic Fervor: mild spoke thro' the Western Porch, in soft gentle tears O Albion mildest Son of Eden! clos'd is thy Western Gate Brothers of Eternity! this Man whose great example We all admir'd &amp; lov'd, whose all benevolent countenance, seen In Eden, in lovely Jerusalem, drew even from envy The tear: and the confession of honesty, open &amp; undisguis'd From mistrust and suspition. The Man is himself become A piteous example of oblivion. To teach the Sons Of Eden, that however great and glorious; however loving And merciful the Individuality; however high Our palaces and cities, and however fruitful are our fields In Selfhood, we are nothing: but fade away in mornings breath. Our mildness is nothing: the greatest mildness we can use Is incapable and nothing! none but the Lamb of God can heal This dread disease: none but Jesus! O Lord descend and save! Albions Western Gate is clos'd: his death is coming apace! Jesus alone can save him; for alas we none can know How soon his lot may be our own. When Africa in sleep Rose in the night of Beulah, and bound down the Sun &amp; Moon His friends cut his strong chains, &amp; overwhelm'd his dark Machines in fury &amp; destruction, and the Man reviving repented He wept before his wrathful brethren, thankful &amp; considerate For their well timed wrath. But Albions sleep is not Like Africa's: and his machines are woven with his life Nothing but mercy can save him! nothing but mercy interposing Lest he should slay Jerusalem in his fearful jealousy O God descend! gather our brethren, deliver Jerusalem[.] But that we may omit no office of the friendly spirit Oxford take thou these leaves of the Tree of Life: with eloquence That thy immortal tongue inspires; present them to Albion: Perhaps he may recieve them, offerd from thy loved hands. So spoke, unhear'd by Albion. the merciful Son of Heaven To those whose Western Gates were open, as they stood weeping Around Albion: but Albion heard him not; obdurate! hard! He frown'd on all his Friends, counting them enemies in his sorrow And the Seventeen conjoining with Bath, the Seventh: In whom the other Ten shone manifest, a Divine Vision! Assimilated and embrac'd Eternal Death for Albions sake. And these the names of the Eighteen combining with those Ten PLATE 41 [46] Bath, mild Physician of Eternity, mysterious power Whose springs are unsearchable &amp; knowledge infinite. Hereford, ancient Guardian of Wales, whose hands Builded the mountain palaces of Eden, stupendous works! Lincoln, Durham &amp; Carlisle, Councellors of Los. And Ely, Scribe of Los, whose pen no other hand Dare touch! Oxford, immortal Bard! with eloquence Divine, he wept over Albion: speaking the words of God In mild perswasion: bringing leaves of the Tree of Life. Thou art in Error Albion, the Land of Ulro: One Error not remov'd, will destroy a human Soul Repose in Beulahs night, till the Error is remov'd Reason not on both sides. Repose upon our bosoms Till the Plow of Jehovah, and the Harrow of Shaddai Have passed over the Dead, to awake the Dead to Judgment. But Albion turn'd away refusing comfort. Oxford trembled while he spoke, then fainted in the arms Of Norwich, Peterboro, Rochester, Chester awful, Worcester, Litchfield, Saint Davids, Landaff, Asaph, Bangor, Sodor, Bowing their heads devoted: and the Furnaces of Los Began to rage, thundering loud the storms began to roar Upon the Furnaces, and loud the Furnaces rebellow beneath And these the Four in whom the twenty-four appear'd four-fold: Verulam, London, York, Edinburgh, mourning one towards another Alas!—The time will come, when a mans worst enemies Shall be those of his own house and family: in a Religion Of Generation, to destroy by Sin and Atonement, happy Jerusalem, The Bride and Wife of the Lamb. O God thou art Not an Avenger! PLATE 42 Thus Albion sat, studious of others in his pale disease: Brooding on evil: but when Los opend the Furnaces before him: He saw that the accursed things were his own affections, And his own beloveds: then he turn'd sick! his soul died within him Also Los sick &amp; terrified beheld the Furnaces of Death And must have died, but the Divine Saviour descended Among the infant loves &amp; affections, and the Divine Vision wept Like evening dew on every herb upon the breathing ground Albion spoke in his dismal dreams: O thou deceitful friend Worshipping mercy &amp; beholding thy friend in such affliction: Los! thou now discoverest thy turpitude to the heavens. I demand righteousness &amp; justice. O thou ingratitude! Give me my Emanations back[,] food for my dying soul! My daughters are harlots! my sons are accursed before me. Enitharmon is my daughter: accursed with a fathers curse! O! I have utterly been wasted! I have given my daughters to devils So spoke Albion in gloomy majesty, and deepest night Of Ulro rolld round his skirts from Dover to Cornwall. Los answerd. Righteousness &amp; justice I give thee in return For thy righteousness! but I add mercy also, and bind Thee from destroying these little ones: am I to be only Merciful to thee and cruel to all that thou hatest[?] Thou wast the Image of God surrounded by the Four Zoa's Three thou hast slain! I am the Fourth: thou canst not destroy me. Thou art in Error; trouble me not with thy righteousness. I have innocence to defend and ignorance to instruct: I have no time for seeming; and little arts of compliment, In morality and virtue: in self-glorying and pride. There is a limit of Opakeness, and a limit of Contraction; In every Individual Man, and the limit of Opakeness, Is named Satan: and the limit of Contraction is named Adam. But when Man sleeps in Beulah, the Saviour in mercy takes Contractions Limit, and of the Limit he forms Woman: That Himself may in process of time be born Man to redeem But there is no Limit of Expansion! there is no Limit of Translucence. In the bosom of Man for ever from eternity to eternity. Therefore I break thy bonds of righteousness; I crush thy messengers! That they may not crush me and mine: do thou be righteous, And I will return it; otherwise I defy thy worst revenge: Consider me as thine enemy: on me turn all thy fury But destroy not these little ones, nor mock the Lords anointed: Destroy not by Moral Virtue, the little ones whom he hath chosen! The little ones whom he hath chosen in preference to thee. He hath cast thee off for ever; the little ones he hath anointed! Thy Selfhood is for ever accursed from the Divine presence So Los spoke: then turn'd his face &amp; wept for Albion. Albion replied. Go! Hand &amp; Hyle! sieze the abhorred friend: As you Have siezd the Twenty-four rebellious ingratitudes; To atone for you, for spiritual death! Man lives by deaths of Men Bring him to justice before heaven here upon London stone, Between Blackheath &amp; Hounslow, between Norwood &amp; Finchley All that they have is mine: from my free genrous gift, They now hold all they have: ingratitude to me! To me their benefactor calls aloud for vengeance deep. Los stood before his Furnaces awaiting the fury of the Dead: And the Divine hand was upon him, strengthening him mightily. The Spectres of the Dead cry out from the deeps beneath Upon the hills of Albion; Oxford groans in his iron furnace Winchester in his den &amp; cavern; they lament against Albion: they curse their human kindness &amp; affection They rage like wild beasts in the forests of affliction In the dreams of Ulro they repent of their human kindness. Come up, build Babylon, Rahab is ours &amp; all her multitudes With her in pomp and glory of victory. Depart Ye twenty-four into the deeps! let us depart to glory! Their Human majestic forms sit up upon their Couches Of death: they curb their Spectres as with iron curbs They enquire after Jerusalem in the regions of the dead, With the voices of dead men, low, scarcely articulate, And with tears cold on their cheeks they weary repose. O when shall the morning of the grave appear, and when Shall our salvation come? we sleep upon our watch We cannot awake! and our Spectres rage in the forests O God of Albion where art thou! pity the watchers! Thus mourn they. Loud the Furnaces of Los thunder upon The clouds of Europe &amp; Asia, among the Serpent Temples! And Los drew his Seven Furnaces around Albions Altars And as Albion built his frozen Altars, Los built the Mundane Shell, In the Four Regions of Humanity East &amp; West &amp; North &amp; South, Till Norwood &amp; Finchley &amp; Blackheath &amp; Hounslow, coverd the whole Earth. This is the Net &amp; Veil of Vala, among the Souls of the Dead. PLATE 43 [29] Then the Divine Vision like a silent Sun appeard above Albions dark rocks: setting behind the Gardens of Kensington On Tyburns River, in clouds of blood: where was mild Zion Hills Most ancient promontory, and in the Sun, a Human Form appeard And thus the Voice Divine went forth upon the rocks of Albion I elected Albion for my glory; I gave to him the Nations, Of the whole Earth. He was the Angel of my Presence: and all The Sons of God were Albions Sons: and Jerusalem was my joy. The Reactor hath hid himself thro envy. I behold him. But you cannot behold him till he be reveald in his System Albions Reactor must have a Place prepard: Albion must Sleep The Sleep of Death, till the Man of Sin &amp; Repentance be reveald. Hidden in Albions Forests he lurks: he admits of no Reply From Albion: but hath founded his Reaction into a Law Of Action, for Obedience to destroy the Contraries of Man[.] He hath compelld Albion to become a Punisher &amp; hath possessd Himself of Albions Forests &amp; Wilds! and Jerusalem is taken! The City of the Woods in the Forest of Ephratah is taken! London is a stone of her ruins; Oxford is the dust of her walls! Sussex &amp; Kent are her scatterd garments: Ireland her holy place: And the murderd bodies of her little ones are Scotland and Wales[.] The Cities of the Nations are the smoke of her consummation The Nations are her dust! ground by the chariot wheels Of her lordly conquerors, her palaces levelld with the dust. I come that I may find a way for my banished ones to return Fear not O little Flock I come! Albion shall rise again. So saying, the mild Sun inclosd the Human Family. Forthwith from Albions darkning locks came two Immortal forms Saying We alone are escaped. O merciful Lord and Saviour, We flee from the interiors of Albions hills and mountains! From his Valleys Eastward: from Amalek Canaan &amp; Moab: Beneath his vast ranges of hills surrounding Jerusalem. Albion walkd on the steps of fire before his Halls And Vala walkd with him in dreams of soft deluding slumber. He looked up &amp; saw the Prince of Light with splendor faded Then Albion ascended mourning into the porches of his Palace Above him rose a Shadow from his wearied intellect: Of living gold, pure, perfect, holy: in white linen pure he hoverd A sweet entrancing self-delusion a watry vision of Albion Soft exulting in existence; all the Man absorbing! Albion fell upon his face prostrate before the watry Shadow Saying O Lord whence is this change! thou knowest I am nothing! And Vala trembled &amp; coverd her face! &amp; her locks were spread on the pavement We heard astonishd at the Vision &amp; our hearts trembled within us: We heard the voice of slumberous Albion, and thus he spake. Idolatrous to his own Shadow words of eternity uttering: O I am nothing when I enter into judgment with thee! If thou withdraw thy breath I die &amp; vanish into Hades If thou dost lay thine hand upon me behold I am silent: If thou withhold thine hand; I perish like a fallen leaf: O I am nothing: and to nothing must return again: If thou withdraw thy breath. Behold I am oblivion. He ceasd: the shadowy voice was silent: but the cloud hoverd over their heads In golden wreathes, the sorrow of Man; &amp; the balmy drops fell down. And lo! that son of Man that Shadowy Spirit of mild Albion: Luvah descended from the cloud; in terror Albion rose: Indignant rose the awful Man, &amp; turnd his back on Vala. We heard the voice of Albion starting from his sleep: Whence is this voice crying Enion! that soundeth in my ears? O cruel pity! O dark deceit! can love seek for dominion? And Luvah strove to gain dominion over Albion They strove together above the Body where Vala was inclosd And the dark Body of Albion left prostrate upon the crystal pavement, Coverd with boils from head to foot: the terrible smitings of Luvah. Then frownd the fallen Man and put forth Luvah from his presence Saying. Go and Die the Death of Man, for Vala the sweet wanderer. I will turn the volutions of your ears outward, and bend your nostrils Downward, and your fluxile eyes englob'd roll round in fear: Your withring lips and tongue shrink up into a narrow circle, Till into narrow forms you creep: go take your fiery way: And learn what tis to absorb the Man you Spirits of Pity &amp; Love. They heard the voice and fled swift as the winters setting sun. And now the human blood foamd high, the Spirits Luvah &amp; Vala Went down the Human Heart where Paradise &amp; its joys abounded, In jealous fears &amp; fury &amp; rage, &amp; flames roll round their fervid feet: And the vast form of Nature like a serpent playd before them And as they fled in folding fires &amp; thunders of the deep: Vala shrunk in like the dark sea that leaves its slimy banks. And from her bosom Luvah fell far as the east and west. And the vast form of Nature like a serpent rolld between, Whether of Jerusalems or Valas ruins congenerated, we know not: All is confusion: all is tumult, &amp; we alone are escaped. So spoke the fugitives; they joind the Divine Family, trembling PLATE 44 [30] And the Two that escaped; were the Emanation of Los &amp; his Spectre: for whereever the Emanation goes, the Spectre Attends her as her Guard, &amp; Los's Emanation is named Enitharmon, &amp; his Spectre is named Urthona: they knew Not where to flee: they had been on a visit to Albions Children And they strove to weave a Shadow of the Emanation To hide themselves: weeping &amp; lamenting for the Vegetation Of Albions Children: fleeing thro Albions vales in streams of gore. Being not irritated by insult bearing insulting benevolences They percieved that corporeal friends are spiritual enemies They saw the Sexual Religion in its embryon Uncircumcision And the Divine hand was upon them bearing them thro darkness Back safe to their Humanity as doves to their windows: Therefore the Sons of Eden praise Urthonas Spectre in Songs Because he kept the Divine Vision in time of trouble. They wept &amp; trembled: &amp; Los put forth his hand &amp; took them in Into his Bosom: from which Albion shrunk in dismal pain; Rending the fibres of Brotherhood &amp; in Feminine Allegories Inclosing Los: but the Divine Vision appeard with Los Following Albion into his Central Void among his Oaks. And Los prayed and said. O Divine Saviour arise Upon the Mountains of Albion as in ancient time. Behold! The Cities of Albion seek thy face, London groans in pain From Hill to Hill &amp; the Thames laments along the Valleys The little Villages of Middlesex &amp; Surrey hunger &amp; thirst The Twenty-eight Cities of Albion stretch their hands to thee: Because of the Opressors of Albion in every City &amp; Village: They mock at the Labourers limbs! they mock at his starvd Children! They buy his Daughters that they may have power to sell his Sons: They compell the Poor to live upon a crust of bread by soft mild arts: They reduce the Man to want: then give with pomp &amp; ceremony. The praise of Jehovah is chaunted from lips of hunger &amp; thirst! Humanity knows not of Sex: wherefore are Sexes in Beulah? In Beulah the Female lets down her beautiful Tabernacle; Which the Male enters magnificent between her Cherubim: And becomes One with her mingling condensing in Self-love The Rocky Law of Condemnation &amp; double Generation, &amp; Death. Albion hath enterd the Loins the place of the Last Judgment: And Luvah hath drawn the Curtains around Albion in Vala's bosom The Dead awake to Generation! Arise O Lord, &amp; rend the Veil! So Los in lamentations followd Albion. Albion coverd, PLATE 45 [31] His western heaven with rocky clouds of death &amp; despair. Fearing that Albion should turn his back against the Divine Vision Los took his globe of fire to search the interiors of Albions Bosom, in all the terrors of friendship, entering the caves Of despair &amp; death, to search the tempters out, walking among Albions rocks &amp; precipices! caves of solitude &amp; dark despair, And saw every Minute Particular of Albion degraded &amp; murderd But saw not by whom; they were hidden within in the minute particulars Of which they had possessd themselves; and there they take up The articulations of a mans soul, and laughing throw it down Into the frame, then knock it out upon the plank, &amp; souls are bak'd In bricks to build the pyramids of Heber &amp; Terah. But Los Searchd in vain: closd from the minutia he walkd, difficult. He came down from Highgate thro Hackney &amp; Holloway towards London Till he came to old Stratford &amp; thence to Stepney &amp; the Isle Of Leuthas Dogs, thence thro the narrows of the Rivers side And saw every minute particular, the jewels of Albion, running down The kennels of the streets &amp; lanes as if they were abhorrd. Every Universal Form, was become barren mountains of Moral Virtue: and every Minute Particular hardend into grains of sand: And all the tendernesses of the soul cast forth as filth &amp; mire, Among the winding places of deep contemplation intricate To where the Tower of London frownd dreadful over Jerusalem: A building of Luvah builded in Jerusalems eastern gate to be His secluded Court: thence to Bethlehem where was builded Dens of despair in the house of bread: enquiring in vain Of stones and rocks he took his way, for human form was none: And thus he spoke, looking on Albions City with many tears What shall I do! what could I do, if I could find these Criminals I could not dare to take vengeance; for all things are so constructed And builded by the Divine hand, that the sinner shall always escape, And he who takes vengeance alone is the criminal of Providence; If I should dare to lay my finger on a grain of sand In way of vengeance; I punish the already punishd: O whom Should I pity if I pity not the sinner who is gone astray! O Albion, if thou takest vengeance; if thou revengest thy wrongs Thou art for ever lost! What can I do to hinder the Sons Of Albion from taking vengeance? or how shall I them perswade. So spoke Los, travelling thro darkness &amp; horrid solitude: And he beheld Jerusalem in Westminster &amp; Marybone, Among the ruins of the Temple: and Vala who is her Shadow, Jerusalems Shadow bent northward over the Island white. At length he sat on London Stone, &amp; heard Jerusalems voice. Albion I cannot be thy Wife. thine own Minute Particulars, Belong to God alone. and all thy little ones are holy They are of Faith &amp; not of Demonstration: wherefore is Vala Clothd in black mourning upon my rivers currents, Vala awake! I hear thy shuttles sing in the sky, and round my limbs I feel the iron threads of love &amp; jealousy &amp; despair. Vala replyd. Albion is mine! Luvah gave me to Albion And now recieves reproach &amp; hate. Was it not said of old Set your Son before a man &amp; he shall take you &amp; your sons For slaves: but set your Daughter before a man &amp; She Shall make him &amp; his sons &amp; daughters your slaves for ever! And is this Faith? Behold the strife of Albion &amp; Luvah Is great in the east, their spears of blood rage in the eastern heaven Urizen is the champion of Albion, they will slay my Luvah: And thou O harlot daughter! daughter of despair art all This cause of these shakings of my towers on Euphrates. Here is the House of Albion, &amp; here is thy secluded place And here we have found thy sins: &amp; hence we turn thee forth, For all to avoid thee: to be astonishd at thee for thy sins: Because thou art the impurity &amp; the harlot: &amp; thy children! Children of whoredoms: born for Sacrifice: for the meat &amp; drink Offering: to sustain the glorious combat &amp; the battle &amp; war That Man may be purified by the death of thy delusions. So saying she her dark threads cast over the trembling River: And over the valleys; from the hills of Hertfordshire to the hills Of Surrey across Middlesex. &amp; across Albions House Of Eternity! pale stood Albion at his eastern gate, PLATE 46 [32] Leaning against the pillars, &amp; his disease rose from his skirts[.] Upon the Precipice he stood! ready to fall into Non-Entity. Los was all astonishment &amp; terror: he trembled sitting on the Stone Of London: but the interiors of Albions fibres &amp; nerves were hidden From Los; astonishd he beheld only the petrified surfaces: And saw his Furnaces in ruins, for Los is the Demon of the Furnaces; He saw also the Four Points of Albion reversd inwards He siezd his Hammer &amp; Tongs, his iron Poker &amp; his Bellows, Upon the valleys of Middlesex, Shouting loud for aid Divine. In stern defiance came from Albions bosom Hand, Hyle, Koban, Gwantok, Peachy, Brertun, Slaid, Huttn, Skofeld, Kock, Kotope Bowen: Albions Sons: they bore him a golden couch into the porch And on the Couch reposd his limbs, trembling from the bloody field. Rearing their Druid Patriarchal rocky Temples around his limbs. (All things begin &amp; end, in Albions Ancient Druid Rocky Shore.) PLATE 47 [When Albion utterd his last words Hope is banishd from me] From Camberwell to Highgate where the mighty Thames shudders along, Where Los's Furnaces stand, where Jerusalem &amp; Vala howl: Luvah tore forth from Albions Loins, in fibrous veins, in rivers Of blood over Europe: a Vegetating Root in grinding pain. Animating the Dragon Temples, soon to become that Holy Fiend The Wicker Man of Scandinavia in which cruelly consumed The Captives reard to heaven howl in flames among the stars Loud the cries of War on the Rhine &amp; Danube, with Albions Sons, Away from Beulahs hills &amp; vales break forth the Souls of the Dead, With cymbal, trumpet, clarion; &amp; the scythed chariots of Britain. And the Veil of Vala, is composed of the Spectres of the Dead Hark! the mingling cries of Luvah with the Sons of Albion Hark! &amp; Record the terrible wonder! that the Punisher Mingles with his Victims Spectre, enslaved and tormented To him whom he has murderd, bound in vengeance &amp; enmity Shudder not, but Write, &amp; the hand of God will assist you! Therefore I write Albions last words. Hope is banish'd from me. PLATE 48 These were his last words, and the merciful Saviour in his arms Reciev'd him, in the arms of tender mercy and repos'd The pale limbs of his Eternal Individuality Upon the Rock of Ages. Then, surrounded with a Cloud: In silence the Divine Lord builded with immortal labour, Of gold &amp; jewels a sublime Ornament, a Couch of repose, With Sixteen pillars: canopied with emblems &amp; written verse. Spiritual Verse, order'd &amp; measur'd, from whence, time shall reveal. The Five books of the Decalogue, the books of Joshua &amp; Judges, Samuel, a double book &amp; Kings, a double book, the Psalms &amp; Prophets The Four-fold Gospel, and the Revelations everlasting Eternity groan'd &amp; was troubled, at the image of Eternal Death! Beneath the bottoms of the Graves, which is Earths central joint, There is a place where Contrarieties are equally true: (To protect from the Giant blows in the sports of intellect, Thunder in the midst of kindness, &amp; love that kills its beloved: Because Death is for a period, and they renew tenfold.) From this sweet Place Maternal Love awoke Jerusalem With pangs she forsook Beulahs pleasant lovely shadowy Universe Where no dispute can come; created for those who Sleep. Weeping was in all Beulah, and all the Daughters of Beulah Wept for their Sister the Daughter of Albion, Jerusalem: When out of Beulah the Emanation of the Sleeper descended With solemn mourning out of Beulahs moony shades and hills: Within the Human Heart, whose Gates closed with solemn sound. And this the manner of the terrible Separation The Emanations of the grievously afflicted Friends of Albion Concenter in one Female form an Aged pensive Woman. Astonish'd! lovely! embracing the sublime shade: the Daughters of Beulah Beheld her with wonder! With awful hands she took A Moment of Time, drawing it out with many tears &amp; afflictions And many sorrows: oblique across the Atlantic Vale Which is the Vale of Rephaim dreadful from East to West, Where the Human Harvest waves abundant in the beams of Eden Into a Rainbow of jewels and gold, a mild Reflection from Albions dread Tomb. Eight thousand and five hundred years In its extension. Every two hundred years has a door to Eden She also took an Atom of Space, with dire pain opening it a Center Into Beulah: trembling the Daughters of Beulah dried Her tears. she ardent embrac'd her sorrows. occupied in labours Of sublime mercy in Rephaims Vale. Perusing Albions Tomb She sat: she walk'd among the ornaments solemn mourning. The Daughters attended her shudderings, wiping the death sweat Los also saw her in his seventh Furnace, he also terrified Saw the finger of God go forth upon his seventh Furnace: Away from the Starry Wheels to prepare Jerusalem a place. When with a dreadful groan the Emanation mild of Albion Burst from his bosom in the Tomb like a pale snowy cloud, Female and lovely, struggling to put off the Human form Writhing in pain. The Daughters of Beulah in kind arms reciev'd Jerusalem: weeping over her among the Spaces of Erin, In the Ends of Beulah, where the Dead wail night &amp; day. And thus Erin spoke to the Daughters of Beulah, in soft tears Albion the Vortex of the Dead! Albion the Generous! Albion the mildest son of Heaven! The Place of Holy Sacrifice! Where Friends Die for each other: will become the Place, Of Murder, &amp; Unforgiving, Never-awaking Sacrifice of Enemies[.] The Children must be sacrific'd! (a horror never known Till now in Beulah.) unless a Refuge can be found To hide them from the wrath of Albions Law that freezes sore Upon his Sons &amp; Daughters, self-exiled from his bosom Draw ye Jerusalem away from Albions Mountains To give a Place for Redemption, let Sihon and Og Remove Eastward to Bashan and Gilead, and leave PLATE 49 The secret coverts of Albion &amp; the hidden places of America Jerusalem Jerusalem! why wilt thou turn away Come ye O Daughters of Beulah, lament for Og &amp; Sihon Upon the Lakes of Ireland from Rathlin to Baltimore: Stand ye upon the Dargle from Wicklow to Drogheda Come &amp; mourn over Albion the White Cliff of the Atlantic The Mountain of Giants: all the Giants of Albion are become Weak! witherd! darkend! &amp; Jerusalem is cast forth from Albion. They deny that they ever knew Jerusalem, or ever dwelt in Shiloh [.] The Gigantic roots &amp; twigs of the vegetating Sons of Albion Filld with the little-ones are consumed in the Fires of their Altars The vegetating Cities are burned &amp; consumed from the Earth: And the Bodies in which all Animals &amp; Vegetations, the Earth &amp; Heaven Were containd in the All Glorious Imagination are witherd &amp; darkend; The golden Gate of Havilah, and all the Garden of God, Was caught up with the Sun in one day of fury and war: The Lungs, the Heart, the Liver, shrunk away far distant from Man And left a little slimy substance floating upon the tides. In one night the Atlantic Continent was caught up with the Moon, And became an Opake Globe far distant clad with moony beams. The Visions of Eternity, by reason of narrowed perceptions, Are become weak Visions of Time &amp; Space, fix'd into furrows of death; Till deep dissimulation is the only defence an honest man has left[.] O Polypus of Death O Spectre over Europe and Asia Withering the Human Form by Laws of Sacrifice for Sin By Laws of Chastity &amp; Abhorrence I am witherd up. Striving to Create a Heaven in which all shall be pure &amp; holy In their Own Selfhoods, in Natural Selfish Chastity to banish Pity And dear Mutual Forgiveness; &amp; to become One Great Satan Inslavd to the most powerful Selfhood: to murder the Divine Humanity In whose sight all are as the dust &amp; who chargeth his Angels with folly! Ah! weak &amp; wide astray! Ah shut in narrow doleful form! Creeping in reptile flesh upon the bosom of the ground! The Eye of Man, a little narrow orb, closd up &amp; dark, Scarcely beholding the Great Light; conversing with the [Void]: The Ear, a little shell, in small volutions shutting out True Harmonies, &amp; comprehending great, as very small: The Nostrils, bent down to the earth &amp; clos'd with senseless flesh. That odours cannot them expand, nor joy on them exult: The Tongue, a little moisture fills, a little food it cloys, A little sound it utters, &amp; its cries are faintly heard. Therefore they are removed: therefore they have taken root In Egypt &amp; Philistea: in Moab &amp; Edom &amp; Aram: In the Erythrean Sea their Uncircu[m]cision in Heart &amp; Loins Be lost for ever &amp; ever. then they shall arise from Self By Self Annihilation into Jerusalems Courts &amp; into Shiloh Shiloh the Masculine Emanation among the Flowers of Beulah Lo Shiloh dwells over France, as Jerusalem dwells over Albion Build &amp; prepare a Wall &amp; Curtain for Americas shore! Rush on: Rush on! Rush on! ye vegetating Sons of Albion The Sun shall go before you in Day: the Moon shall go Before you in Night. Come on! Come on! Come on! The Lord Jehovah is before, behind, above, beneath, around He has builded the arches of Albions Tomb binding the Stars In merciful Order, bending the Laws of Cruelty to Peace. He hath placed Og &amp; Anak, the Giants of Albion for their Guards: Building the Body of Moses in the Valley of Peor: the Body Of Divine Analogy; and Og &amp; Sihon in the tears of Balaam The Son of Beor, have given their power to Joshua &amp; Caleb. Remove from Albion, far remove these terrible surfaces. They are beginning to form Heavens &amp; Hells in immense Circles: the Hells for food to the Heavens: food of torment, Food of despair: they drink the condemnd Soul &amp; rejoice In cruel holiness, in their Heavens of Chastity &amp; Uncircumcision Yet they are blameless &amp; Iniquity must be imputed only To the State they are enterd into that they may be deliverd: Satan is the State of Death, &amp; not a Human existence: But Luvah is named Satan, because he has enterd that State. A World where Man is by Nature the enemy of Man Because the Evil is Created into a State. that Men May be deliverd time after time evermore. Amen. Learn therefore O Sisters to distinguish the Eternal Human That walks about among the stones of fire in bliss &amp; woe Alternate! from those States or Worlds in which the Spirit travels: This is the only means to Forgiveness of Enemies Therefore remove from Albion these terrible Surfaces And let wild seas &amp; rocks close up Jerusalem away from PLATE 50 The Atlantic Mountains where Giants dwelt in Intellect; Now given to stony Druids, and Allegoric Generation To the Twelve Gods of Asia, the Spectres of those who Sleep: Sway'd by a Providence oppos'd to the Divine Lord Jesus: A murderous Providence! A Creation that groans, living on Death. Where Fish &amp; Bird &amp; Beast &amp; Man &amp; Tree &amp; Metal &amp; Stone Live by Devouring, going into Eternal Death continually: Albion is now possess'd by the War of Blood! the Sacrifice Of envy Albion is become, and his Emanation cast out: Come Lord Jesus, Lamb of God descend! for if; O Lord! If thou hadst been here, our brother Albion had not died. Arise sisters! Go ye &amp; meet the Lord, while I remain— Behold the foggy mornings of the Dead on Albions cliffs! Ye know that if the Emanation remains in them: She will become an Eternal Death, an Avenger of Sin A Self-righteousness: the proud Virgin-Harlot! Mother of War! And we also &amp; all Beulah, consume beneath Albions curse. So Erin spoke to the Daughters of Beulah. Shuddering With their wings they sat in the Furnace, in a night Of stars, for all the Sons of Albion appeard distant stars, Ascending and descending into Albions sea of death. And Erins lovely Bow enclos'd the Wheels of Albions Sons. Expanding on wing, the Daughters of Beulah replied in sweet response Come O thou Lamb of God and take away the remembrance of Sin To Sin &amp; to hide the Sin in sweet deceit. is lovely!! To Sin in the open face of day is cruel &amp; pitiless! But To record the Sin for a reproach: to let the Sun go down In a remembrance of the Sin: is a Woe &amp; a Horror! A brooder of an Evil Day, and a Sun rising in blood Come then O Lamb of God and take away the remembrance of Sin PLATE 52 End of Chap. 2?. To the Deists. Rahab is an Eternal State The Spiritual States of the Soul are all Eternal Distinguish between the Man, &amp; his present State He never can be a Friend to the Human Race who is the Preacher of Natural Morality or Natural Religion. he is a flatterer who means to betray, to perpetuate Tyrant Pride &amp; the Laws of that Babylon which he forsees shall shortly be destroyed, with the Spiritual and not the Natural Sword: He is in the State named Rahab: which State must be put off before he can be the Friend of Man. You O Deists profess yourselves the Enemies of Christianity: and you are so: you are also the Enemies of the Human Race &amp; of Universal Nature. Man is born a Spectre or Satan &amp; is altogether an Evil, &amp; requires a New Selfhood continually &amp; must continually be changed into his direct Contrary. But your Greek Philosophy (which is a remnant of Druidism) teaches that Man is Righteous in his Vegetated Spectre: an Opinion of fatal &amp; accursed consequence to Man, as the Ancients saw plainly by Revelation to the intire abrogation of Experimental Theory. and many believed what they saw, and Prophecied of Jesus. Man must &amp; will have Some Religion; if he has not the Religion of Jesus, he will have the Religion of Satan, &amp; will erect the Synagogue of Satan. calling the Prince of this World, God; and destroying all who do not worship Satan under the Name of God. Will any one say: Where are those who worship Satan under the Name of God! Where are they? Listen! Every Religion that Preaches Vengeance for Sin is the Religion of the Enemy &amp; Avenger; and not of the Forgiver of Sin, and their God is Satan, Named by the Divine Name. Your Religion O Deists: Deism, is the Worship of the God of this World by the means of what you call Natural Religion and Natural Philosophy, and of Natural Morality or Self-Righteousness, the Selfish Virtues of the Natural Heart. This was the Religion of the Pharisees who murderd Jesus. Deism is the same &amp; ends in the same. Voltaire Rousseau Gibbon Hume. charge the Spiritually Religious with Hypocrisy! but how a Monk or a Methodist either, can be a Hypocrite: I cannot concieve. We are Men of like passions with others &amp; pretend not to be holier than others: therefore, when a Religious Man falls into Sin, he ought not to be calld a Hypocrite: this title is more properly to be given to a Player who falls into Sin; whose profession is Virtue &amp; Morality &amp; the making Men Self-Righteous. Foote in calling Whitefield, Hypocrite: was himself one: for Whitefield pretended not to be holier than others: but confessed his Sins before all the World; Voltaire! Rousseau! You cannot escape my charge that you are Pharisees &amp; Hypocrites, for you are constantly talking of the Virtues of the Human Heart, and particularly of your own, that you may accuse others &amp; especially the Religious, whose errors, you by this display of pretended Virtue, chiefly design to expose. Rousseau thought Men Good by Nature; he found them Evil &amp; found no friend. Friendship cannot exist without Forgiveness of Sins continually. The Book written by Rousseau calld his Confessions is an apology &amp; cloke for his sin &amp; not a confession. But you also charge the poor Monks &amp; Religious with being the causes of War: while you acquit &amp; flatter the Alexanders &amp; Caesars, the Lewis's &amp; Fredericks: who alone are its causes &amp; its actors. But the Religion of Jesus, Forgiveness of Sin, can never be the cause of a War nor of a single Martyrdom. Those who Martyr others or who cause War are Deists, but never can be Forgivers of Sin. The Glory of Christianity is, To Conquer by Forgiveness. All the Destruction therefore, in Christian Europe has arisen from Deism, which is Natural Religion. I saw a Monk of Charlemaine Arise before my sight I talkd with the Grey Monk as we stood In beams of infernal light Gibbon arose with a lash of steel And Voltaire with a wracking wheel The Schools in clouds of learning rolld Arose with War in iron &amp; gold. Thou lazy Monk they sound afar In vain condemning glorious War And in your Cell you shall ever dwell Rise War &amp; bind him in his Cell. The blood. red ran from the Grey Monks side His hands &amp; feet were wounded wide His body bent, his arms &amp; knees Like to the roots of ancient trees When Satan first the black bow bent And the Moral Law from the Gospel rent He forgd the Law into a Sword And spilld the blood of mercys Lord. Titus! Constantine! Charlemaine! O Voltaire! Rousseau! Gibbon! Vain Your Grecian Mocks &amp; Roman Sword Against this image of his Lord! For a Tear is an Intellectual thing; And a Sigh is the Sword of an Angel King And the bitter groan of a Martyrs woe Is an Arrow from the Almighties Bow! PLATE 53 Chap 3. But Los, who is the Vehicular Form of strong Urthona Wept vehemently over Albion where Thames currents spring From the rivers of Beulah; pleasant river! soft, mild, parent stream And the roots of Albions Tree enterd the Soul of Los As he sat before his Furnaces clothed in sackcloth of hair In gnawing pain dividing him from his Emanation; Inclosing all the children of Los time after time. Their Giant forms condensing into Nations &amp; Peoples &amp; Tongues Translucent the Furnaces, of Beryll &amp; Emerald immortal: And Seven-fold each within other: incomprehensible To the Vegetated Mortal Eye's perverted &amp; single vision The Bellows are the Animal Lungs. the Hammers, the Animal Heart The Furnaces, the Stomach for Digestion; terrible their fury Like seven burning heavens rang'd from South to North Here on the banks of the Thames, Los builded Golgonooza, Outside of the Gates of the Human Heart, beneath Beulah In the midst of the rocks of the Altars of Albion. In fears He builded it, in rage &amp; in fury. It is the Spiritual Fourfold London: continually building &amp; continually decaying desolate! In eternal labours: loud the Furnaces &amp; loud the Anvils Of Death thunder incessant around the flaming Couches of The Twentyfour Friends of Albion and round the awful Four For the protection of the Twelve Emanations of Albions Sons The Mystic Union of the Emanation in the Lord; Because Man divided from his Emanation is a dark Spectre His Emanation is an ever-weeping melancholy Shadow But she is made receptive of Generation thro' mercy In the Potters Furnace, among the Funeral Urns of Beulah From Surrey hills, thro' Italy and Greece, to Hinnoms vale. PLATE 54 In Great Eternity, every particular Form gives forth or Emanates Its own peculiar Light, &amp; the Form is the Divine Vision And the Light is his Garment. This is Jerusalem in every Man A Tent &amp; Tabernacle of Mutual Forgiveness Male &amp; Female Clothings. And Jerusalem is called Liberty among the Children of Albion But Albion fell down a Rocky fragment from Eternity hurld By his own Spectre, who is the Reasoning Power in every Man Into his own Chaos which is the Memory between Man &amp; Man The silent broodings of deadly revenge springing from the All powerful parental affection, fills Albion from head to foot Seeing his Sons assimilate with Luvah, bound in the bonds Of spiritual Hate, from which springs Sexual Love as iron chains: He tosses like a cloud outstretchd among Jerusalems Ruins Which overspread all the Earth, he groans among his ruind porches But the Spectre like a hoar frost &amp; a Mildew rose over Albion Saying, I am God O Sons of Men! I am your Rational Power! Am I not Bacon &amp; Newton &amp; Locke who teach Humility to Man! Who teach Doubt &amp; Experiment &amp; my two Wings Voltaire: Rousseau. Where is that Friend of Sinners! that Rebel against my Laws! Who teaches Belief to the Nations, &amp; an unknown Eternal Life Come hither into the Desart &amp; turn these stones to bread. Vain foolish Man! wilt thou believe without Experiment? And build a World of Phantasy upon my Great Abyss! A World of Shapes in craving lust &amp; devouring appetite So spoke the hard cold constrictive Spectre he is named Arthur Constricting into Druid Rocks round Canaan Agag &amp; Aram &amp; Pharoh Then Albion drew England into his bosom in groans &amp; tears But she stretchd out her starry Night in Spaces against him. like A long Serpent, in the Abyss of the Spectre which augmented The Night with Dragon wings coverd with stars &amp; in the Wings Jerusalem &amp; Vala appeard: &amp; above between the Wings magnificent The Divine Vision dimly appeard in clouds of blood weeping. PLATE 55 When those who disregard all Mortal Things, saw a Mighty-One Among the Flowers of Beulah still retain his awful strength They wonderd; checking their wild flames &amp; Many gathering Together into an Assembly; they said, let us go down And see these changes! Others said, If you do so prepare For being driven from our fields, what have we to do with the Dead? To be their inferiors or superiors we equally abhor; Superior, none we know: inferior none: all equal share Divine Benevolence &amp; joy, for the Eternal Man Walketh among us, calling us his Brothers &amp; his Friends: Forbidding us that Veil which Satan puts between Eve &amp; Adam By which the Princes of the Dead enslave their Votaries Teaching them to form the Serpent of precious stones &amp; gold To sieze the Sons of Jerusalem &amp; plant them in One Mans Loins To make One Family of Contraries: that Joseph may be sold Into Egypt: for Negation; a Veil the Saviour born &amp; dying rends. But others said: Let us to him who only Is, &amp; who Walketh among us, give decision. bring forth all your fires! So saying, an eternal deed was done: in fiery flames The Universal Concave raged, such thunderous sounds as never Were sounded from a mortal cloud, nor on Mount Sinai old Nor in Havilah where the Cherub rolld his redounding flame. Loud! loud! the Mountains lifted up their voices, loud the Forests Rivers thunderd against their banks, loud Winds furious fought Cities &amp; Nations contended in fires &amp; clouds &amp; tempests. The Seas raisd up their voices &amp; lifted their hands on high The Stars in their courses fought. the Sun! Moon! Heaven: Earth. Contending for Albion &amp; for Jerusalem his Emanation And for Shiloh, the Emanation of France &amp; for lovely Vala. Then far the greatest number were about to make a Separation And they Elected Seven, calld the Seven Eyes of God; Lucifer, Molech, Elohim, Shaddai, Pahad, Jehovah, Jesus. They namd the Eighth. he came not, he hid in Albions Forests But first they said: (&amp; their Words stood in Chariots in array Curbing their Tygers with golden bits &amp; bridles of silver &amp; ivory) Let the Human Organs be kept in their perfect Integrity At will Contracting into Worms, or Expanding into Gods And then behold! what are these Ulro Visions of Chastity[?] Then as the moss upon the tree: or dust upon the plow: Or as the sweat upon the labouring shoulder: or as the chaff Of the wheat-floor or as the dregs of the sweet wine-press Such are these Ulro Visions, for tho we sit down within The plowed furrow. listning to the weeping clods till we Contract or Expand Space at will: or if we raise ourselves Upon the chariots of the morning. Contracting or Expanding Time! Every one knows, we are One Family: One Man blessed for ever Silence remaind &amp; every one resumd his Human Majesty And many conversed on these things as they labourd at the furrow Saying: It is better to prevent misery, than to release from misery It is better to prevent error, than to forgive the criminal: Labour well the Minute Particulars, attend to the Little-ones: And those who are in misery cannot remain so long If we do but our duty: labour well the teeming Earth. They Plow'd in tears, the trumpets sounded before the golden Plow And the voices of the Living Creatures were heard in the clouds of heaven Crying: Compell the Reasoner to Demonstrate with unhewn Demonstrations Let the Indefinite be explored. and let every Man be Judged By his own Works, Let all Indefinites be thrown into Demonstrations To be pounded to dust &amp; melted in the Furnaces of Affliction: He who would do good to another, must do it in Minute Particulars General Good is the plea of the scoundrel hypocrite &amp; flatterer: For Art &amp; Science cannot exist but in minutely organized Particulars And not in generalizing Demonstrations of the Rational Power. The Infinite alone resides in Definite &amp; Determinate Identity Establishment of Truth depends on destruction of Falshood continually On Circumcision: not on Virginity, O Reasoners of Albion So cried they at the Plow. Albions Rock frowned above And the Great Voice of Eternity rolled above terrible in clouds Saying Who will go forth for us! &amp; Who shall we send before our face? PLATE 56 Then Los heaved his thund'ring Bellows on the Valley of Middlesex And thus he chaunted his Song: the Daughters of Albion reply. What may Man be? who can tell! But what may Woman be? To have power over Man from Cradle to corruptible Grave. He who is an Infant, and whose Cradle is a Manger Knoweth the Infant sorrow: whence it came, and where it goeth: And who weave it a Cradle of the grass that withereth away. This World is all a Cradle for the erred wandering Phantom: Rock'd by Year, Month, Day &amp; Hour; and every two Moments Between, dwells a Daughter of Beulah, to feed the Human Vegetable Entune: Daughters of Albion. your hymning Chorus mildly! Cord of affection thrilling extatic on the iron Reel: To the golden Loom of Love! to the moth-labourd Woof A Garment and Cradle weaving for the infantine Terror: For fear; at entering the gate into our World of cruel Lamentation: it flee back &amp; hide in Non-Entitys dark wild Where dwells the Spectre of Albion: destroyer of Definite Form. The Sun shall be a Scythed Chariot of Britain: the Moon; a Ship In the British Ocean! Created by Los's Hammer; measured out Into Days &amp; Nights &amp; Years &amp; Months. to travel with my feet Over these desolate rocks of Albion: O daughters of despair! Rock the Cradle, and in mild melodies tell me where found What you have enwoven with so much tears &amp; care? so much Tender artifice: to laugh: to weep: to learn: to know; Remember! recollect! what dark befel in wintry days O it was lost for ever! and we found it not: it came And wept at our wintry Door: Look! look! behold! Gwendolen Is become a Clod of Clay! Merlin is a Worm of the Valley! Then Los uttered with Hammer &amp; Anvil: Chaunt! revoice! I mind not your laugh: and your frown I not fear! and You must my dictate obey from your gold-beam'd Looms; trill Gentle to Albions Watchman, on Albions mountains; reeccho And rock the Cradle while! Ah me! Of that Eternal Man And of the cradled Infancy in his bowels of compassion: Who fell beneath his instruments of husbandry &amp; became Subservient to the clods of the furrow! the cattle and even The emmet and earth-Worms are his superiors &amp; his lords. Then the response came warbling from trilling Looms in Albion We Women tremble at the light therefore: hiding fearful The Divine Vision with Curtain &amp; Veil &amp; fleshly Tabernacle Los utter'd: swift as the rattling thunder upon the mountains[:] Look back into the Church Paul! Look! Three Women around The Cross! O Albion why didst thou a Female Will Create? PLATE 57 And the voices of Bath &amp; Canterbury &amp; York &amp; Edinburgh. Cry Over the Plow of Nations in the strong hand of Albion thundering along Among the Fires of the Druid &amp; the deep black rethundering Waters Of the Atlantic which poured in impetuous loud loud. louder &amp; louder. And the Great Voice of the Atlantic howled over the Druid Altars: Weeping over his Children in Stone-henge in Malden &amp; Colchester.

What is a Church? &amp; What Is a Theatre? are they Two &amp; not One? can they Exist Separate? Are not Religion &amp; Politics the Same Thing? Brotherhood is Religion O Demonstrations of Reason Dividing Families in Cruelty &amp; Pride! But Albion fled from the Divine Vision, with the Plow of Nations enflaming The Living Creatures maddend and Albion fell into the Furrow, and The Plow went over him &amp; the Living was Plowed in among the Dead But his Spectre rose over the starry Plow. Albion fled beneath the Plow Till he came to the Rock of Ages. &amp; he took his Seat upon the Rock. Wonder siezd all in Eternity! to behold the Divine Vision. open The Center into an Expanse, &amp; the Center rolled out into an Expanse.

And a peculiar Tabernacle, to cut the integuments of beauty Into veils of tears and sorrows O lovely Jerusalem! They have perswaded thee to this, therefore their end shall come And I will lead thee thro the Wilderness in shadow of my cloud And in my love I will lead thee, lovely Shadow of Sleeping Albion. This is the Song of the Lamb, sung by Slaves in evening time. But Jerusalem faintly saw him, closd in the Dungeons of Babylon Her Form was held by Beulahs Daughters. but all within unseen She sat at the Mills, her hair unbound her feet naked Cut with the flints: her tears run down, her reason grows like The Wheel of Hand. incessant turning day &amp; night without rest Insane she raves upon the winds hoarse, inarticulate: All night Vala hears. she triumphs in pride of holiness To see Jerusalem deface her lineaments with bitter blows Of despair. while the Satanic Holiness triumphd in Vala In a Religion of Chastity &amp; Uncircumcised Selfishness Both of the Head &amp; Heart &amp; Loins, closd up in Moral Pride. But the Divine Lamb stood beside Jerusalem. oft she saw The lineaments Divine &amp; oft the Voice heard, &amp; oft she said: O Lord &amp; Saviour, have the Gods of the Heathen pierced thee? Or hast thou been pierced in the House of thy Friends? Art thou alive! &amp; livest thou for-evermore? or art thou Not: but a delusive shadow, a thought that liveth not. Babel mocks saying, there is no God nor Son of God That thou O Human Imagination, O Divine Body art all A delusion. but I know thee O Lord when thou arisest upon My weary eyes even in this dungeon &amp; this iron mill. The Stars of Albion cruel rise; thou bindest to sweet influences: For thou also sufferest with me altho I behold thee not; And altho I sin &amp; blaspheme thy holy name, thou pitiest me; Because thou knowest I am deluded by the turning mills. And by these visions of pity &amp; love because of Albions death. Thus spake Jerusalem, &amp; thus the Divine Voice replied. Mild Shade of Man, pitiest thou these Visions of terror &amp; woe! Give forth thy pity &amp; love. fear not! lo I am with thee always. Only believe in me that I have power to raise from death Thy Brother who Sleepeth in Albion: fear not trembling Shade PLATE 61 Behold: in the Visions of Elohim Jehovah. behold Joseph &amp; Mary And be comforted O Jerusalem in the Visions of Jehovah Elohim She looked &amp; saw Joseph the Carpenter in Nazareth &amp; Mary His espoused Wife. And Mary said, If thou put me away from thee Dost thou not murder me? Joseph spoke in anger &amp; fury. Should I Marry a Harlot &amp; an Adulteress? Mary answerd, Art thou more pure Than thy Maker who forgiveth Sins &amp; calls again Her that is Lost Tho She hates. he calls her again in love. I love my dear Joseph But he driveth me away from his presence. yet I hear the voice of God In the voice of my Husband. tho he is angry for a moment, he will not Utterly cast me away. if I were pure, never could I taste the sweets Of the Forgive[ne]ss of Sins! if I were holy! I never could behold the tears Of love! of him who loves me in the midst of his anger in furnace of fire. Ah my Mary: said Joseph: weeping over &amp; embracing her closely in His arms: Doth he forgive Jerusalem &amp; not exact Purity from her who is Polluted. I heard his voice in my sleep &amp; his Angel in my dream: Saying, Doth Jehovah Forgive a Debt only on condition that it shall Be Payed? Doth he Forgive Pollution only on conditions of Purity That Debt is not Forgiven! That Pollution is not Forgiven Such is the Forgiveness of the Gods, the Moral Virtues of the Heathen, whose tender Mercies are Cruelty. But Jehovahs Salvation Is without Money &amp; without Price, in the Continual Forgiveness of Sins In the Perpetual Mutual Sacrifice in Great Eternity! for behold! There is none that liveth &amp; Sinneth not! And this is the Covenant Of Jehovah: If you Forgive one-another, so shall Jehovah Forgive You: That He Himself may Dwell among You. Fear not then to take To thee Mary thy Wife, for she is with Child by the Holy Ghost Then Mary burst forth into a Song! she flowed like a River of Many Streams in the arms of Joseph &amp; gave forth her tears of joy Like many waters, and Emanating into gardens &amp; palaces upon Euphrates &amp; to forests &amp; floods &amp; animals wild &amp; tame from Gihon to Hiddekel, &amp; to corn fields &amp; villages &amp; inhabitants Upon Pison &amp; Arnon &amp; Jordan. And I heard the voice among The Reapers Saying, Am I Jerusalem the lost Adulteress? or am I Babylon come up to Jerusalem? And another voice answerd Saying Does the voice of my Lord call me again? am I pure thro his Mercy And Pity. Am I become lovely as a Virgin in his sight who am Indeed a Harlot drunken with the Sacrifice of Idols does he Call her pure as he did in the days of her Infancy when She Was cast out to the loathing of her person. The Chaldean took Me from my Cradle. The Amalekite stole me away upon his Camels Before I had ever beheld with love the Face of Jehovah; or known That there was a God of Mercy: O Mercy O Divine Humanity! O Forgiveness &amp; Pity &amp; Compassion! If I were Pure I should never Have known Thee; If I were Unpolluted I should never have Glorified thy Holiness, or rejoiced in thy great Salvation. Mary leaned her side against Jerusalem, Jerusalem recieved The Infant into her hands in the Visions of Jehovah. Times passed on Jerusalem fainted over the Cross &amp; Sepulcher She heard the voice Wilt thou make Rome thy Patriarch Druid &amp; the Kings of Europe his Horsemen? Man in the Resurrection changes his Sexual Garments at will Every Harlot was once a Virgin: every Criminal an Infant Love! PLATE 62 Repose on me till the morning of the Grave. I am thy life. Jerusalem replied. I am an outcast: Albion is dead! I am left to the trampling foot &amp; the spurning heel! A Harlot I am calld. I am sold from street to street! I am defaced with blows &amp; with the dirt of the Prison! And wilt thou become my Husband O my Lord &amp; Saviour? Shall Vala bring thee forth! shall the Chaste be ashamed also? I see the Maternal Line, I behold the Seed of the Woman! Cainah, &amp; Ada &amp; Zillah &amp; Naamah Wife of Noah. Shuahs daughter &amp; Tamar &amp; Rahab the Canaanites: Ruth the Moabite &amp; Bathsheba of the daughters of Heth Naamah the Ammonite, Zibeah the Philistine, &amp; Mary These are the Daughters of Vala, Mother of the Body of death But I thy Magdalen behold thy Spiritual Risen Body Shall Albion arise? I know he shall arise at the Last Day! I know that in my flesh I shall see God: but Emanations Are weak. they know not whence they are, nor whither tend. Jesus replied. I am the Resurrection &amp; the Life. I Die &amp; pass the limits of possibility, as it appears To individual perception. Luvah must be Created And Vala; for I cannot leave them in the gnawing Grave. But will prepare a way for my banished-ones to return Come now with me into the villages. walk thro all the cities. Tho thou art taken to prison &amp; judgment, starved in the streets I will command the cloud to give thee food &amp; the hard rock To flow with milk &amp; wine, tho thou seest me not a season Even a long season &amp; a hard journey &amp; a howling wilderness! Tho Valas cloud hide thee &amp; Luvahs fires follow thee! Only believe &amp; trust in me, Lo. I am always with thee! So spoke the Lamb of God while Luvahs Cloud reddening above Burst forth in streams of blood upon the heavens &amp; dark night Involvd Jerusalem. &amp; the Wheels of Albions Sons turnd hoarse Over the Mountains &amp; the fires blaz'd on Druid Altars And the Sun set in Tyburns Brook where Victims howl &amp; cry. But Los beheld the Divine Vision among the flames of the Furnaces Therefore he lived &amp; breathed in hope. but his tears fell incessant Because his Children were closd from him apart: &amp; Enitharmon Dividing in fierce pain: also the Vision of God was closd in clouds Of Albions Spectres, that Los in despair oft sat, &amp; often ponderd On Death Eternal in fierce shudders upon the mountains of Albion Walking: &amp; in the vales in howlings fierce, then to his Anvils Turning, anew began his labours, tho in terrible pains! PLATE 63 Jehovah stood among the Druids in the Valley of Annandale When the Four Zoas of Albion, the Four Living Creatures, the Cherubim Of Albion tremble before the Spectre, in the starry Harness of the Plow Of Nations. And their Names are Urizen &amp; Luvah &amp; Tharmas &amp; Urthona Luvah slew Tharmas the Angel of the Tongue &amp; Albion brought him To Justice in his own City of Paris, denying the Resurrection Then Vala the Wife of Albion, who is the Daughter of Luvah Took vengeance Twelve-fold among the Chaotic Rocks of the Druids Where the Human Victims howl to the Moon &amp; Thor &amp; Friga Dance the dance of death contending with Jehovah among the Cherubim. The Chariot Wheels filled with Eyes rage along the howling Valley In the Dividing of Reuben &amp; Benjamin bleeding from Chesters River The Giants &amp; the Witches &amp; the Ghosts of Albion dance with Thor &amp; Friga, &amp; the Fairies lead the Moon along the Valley of Cherubim Bleeding in torrents from Mountain to Mountain, a lovely Victim And Jehovah stood in the Gates of the Victim, &amp; he appeared A weeping Infant in the Gates of Birth in the midst of Heaven The Cities &amp; Villages of Albion became Rock &amp; Sand Unhumanized The Druid Sons of Albion &amp; the Heavens a Void around unfathomable No Human Form but Sexual &amp; a little weeping Infant pale reflected Multitudinous in the Looking Glass of Enitharmon, on all sides Around in the clouds of the Female, on Albions Cliffs of the Dead Such the appearance in Cheviot: in the Divisions of Reuben When the Cherubim hid their heads under their wings in deep slumbers When the Druids demanded Chastity from Woman &amp; all was lost. How can the Female be Chaste O thou stupid Druid Cried Los Without the Forgiveness of Sins in the merciful clouds of Jehovah And without the Baptism of Repentance to wash away Calumnies. and The Accusations of Sin that each may be Pure in their Neighbours sight O when shall Jehovah give us Victims from his Flocks &amp; Herds Instead of Human Victims by the Daughters of Albion &amp; Canaan Then laugh'd Gwendolen &amp; her laughter shook the Nations &amp; Familys of The Dead beneath Beulah from Tyburn to Golgotha, and from Ireland to Japan. furious her Lions &amp; Tygers &amp; Wolves sport before Los on the Thames &amp; Medway. London &amp; Canterbury groan in pain Los knew not yet what was done: he thought it was all in Vision In Visions of the Dreams of Beulah among the Daughters of Albion Therefore the Murder was put apart in the Looking-Glass of Enitharmon He saw in Vala's hand the Druid Knife of Revenge &amp; the Poison Cup Of Jealousy, and thought it a Poetic Vision of the Atmospheres Till Canaan rolld apart from Albion across the Rhine: along the Danube And all the Land of Canaan suspended over the Valley of Cheviot From Bashan to Tyre &amp; from Troy to Gaza of the Amalekite And Reuben fled with his head downwards among the Caverns PLATE 64 Of the Mundane Shell which froze on all sides round Canaan on The vast Expanse: where the Daughters of Albion Weave the Web Of Ages &amp; Generations, folding &amp; unfolding it, like a Veil of Cherubim And sometimes it touches the Earths summits, &amp; sometimes spreads Abroad into the Indefinite Spectre, who is the Rational Power. Then All the Daughters of Albion became One before Los: even Vala! And she put forth her hand upon the Looms in dreadful howlings Till she vegetated into a hungry Stomach &amp; a devouring Tongue. Her Hand is a Court of Justice, her Feet: two Armies in Battle Storms &amp; Pestilence: in her Locks: &amp; in her Loins Earthquake. And Fire. &amp; the Ruin of Cities &amp; Nations &amp; Families &amp; Tongues She cries: The Human is but a Worm, &amp; thou O Male: Thou art Thyself Female, a Male: a breeder of Seed: a Son &amp; Husband: &amp; Lo. The Human Divine is Womans Shadow, a Vapor in the summers heat Go assume Papal dignity thou Spectre, thou Male Harlot! Arthur Divide into the Kings of Europe in times remote O Woman-born And Woman-nourishd &amp; Woman-educated &amp; Woman-scorn'd! Wherefore art thou living? said Los, &amp; Man cannot live in thy presence Art thou Vala the Wife of Albion O thou lovely Daughter of Luvah All Quarrels arise from Reasoning. the secret Murder, and The violent Man-slaughter. these are the Spectres double Cave The Sexual Death living on accusation of Sin &amp; Judgment To freeze Love &amp; Innocence into the gold &amp; silver of the Merchant Without Forgiveness of Sin Love is Itself Eternal Death. Then the Spectre drew Vala into his bosom magnificent terrific Glittering with precious stones &amp; gold, with Garments of blood &amp; fire[.] He wept in deadly wrath of the Spectre, in self-contradicting agony Crimson with Wrath &amp; green with Jealousy dazling with Love And Jealousy immingled &amp; the purple of the violet darkend deep Over the Plow of Nations thundring in the hand of Albions Spectre A dark Hermaphrodite they stood frowning upon Londons River And the Distaff &amp; Spindle in the hands of Vala with the Flax of Human Miseries turnd fierce with the Lives of Men along the Valley As Reuben fled before the Daughters of Albion Taxing the Nations Derby Peak yawnd a horrid Chasm at the Cries of Gwendolen, &amp; at The stamping feet of Ragan upon the flaming Treddles of her Loom That drop with crimson gore with the Loves of Albion &amp; Canaan Opening along the Valley of Rephaim, weaving over the Caves of Machpelah PLATE 65 To decide Two Worlds with a great decision: a World of Mercy, and A World of Justice: the World of Mercy for Salvation To cast Luvah into the Wrath, and Albion into the Pity In the Two Contraries of Humanity &amp; in the Four Regions. For in the depths of Albions bosom in the eastern heaven, They sound the clarions strong! they chain the howling Captives! They cast the lots into the helmet: they give the oath of blood in Lambeth They vote the death of Luvah, &amp; they naild him to Albions Tree in Bath: They staind him with poisonous blue, they inwove him in cruel roots To die a death of Six thousand years bound round with vegetation The sun was black &amp; the moon rolld a useless globe thro Britain! Then left the Sons of Urizen the plow &amp; harrow, the loom The hammer &amp; the chisel, &amp; the rule &amp; compasses; from London fleeing They forg'd the sword on Cheviot, the chariot of war &amp; the battle-ax, The trumpet fitted to mortal battle, &amp; the flute of summer in Annandale And all the Arts of Life. they changd into the Arts of Death in Albion. The hour-glass contemnd because its simple workmanship. Was like the workmanship of the plowman, &amp; the water wheel, That raises water into cisterns: broken &amp; burnd with fire: Because its workmanship. was like the workmanship of the shepherd. And in their stead, intricate wheels invented, wheel without wheel: To perplex youth in their outgoings, &amp; to bind to labours in Albion Of day &amp; night the myriads of eternity that they may grind And polish brass &amp; iron hour after hour laborious task! Kept ignorant of its use, that they might spend the days of wisdom In sorrowful drudgery, to obtain a scanty pittance of bread: In ignorance to view a small portion &amp; think that All, And call it Demonstration: blind to all the simple rules of life. Now: now the battle rages round thy tender limbs O Vala, Now smile among thy bitter tears: now put on all thy beauty Is not the wound of the sword sweet! &amp; the broken bone delightful? Wilt thou now smile among the scythes when the wounded groan in the field[?] We were carried away in thousands from London; &amp; in tens Of thousands from Westminster &amp; Marybone in ships closd up: Chaind hand &amp; foot, compelld to fight under the iron whips Of our captains; fearing our officers more than the enemy. Lift up thy blue eyes Vala &amp; put on thy sapphire shoes: O melancholy Magdalen behold the morning over Malden break; Gird on thy flaming zone, descend into the sepulcher of Canterbury. Scatter the blood from thy golden brow, the tears from thy silver locks: Shake off the waters from thy wings! &amp; the dust from thy white garments Remember all thy feigned terrors on the secret couch of Lambeths Vale When the sun rose in glowing morn, with arms of mighty hosts Marching to battle who was wont to rise with Urizens harps Girt as a sower with his seed to scatter life abroad over Albion: Arise O Vala! bring the bow of Urizen: bring the swift arrows of light. How rag'd the golden horses of Urizen, compelld to the chariot of love! Compelld to leave the plow to the ox, to snuff up the winds of desolation To trample the corn fields in boastful neighings: this is no gentle harp This is no warbling brook, nor shadow of a mirtle tree: But blood and wounds and dismal cries, and shadows of the oak: And hearts laid open to the light, by the broad grizly sword: And bowels hid in hammerd steel rip'd quivering on the ground. Call forth thy smiles of soft deceit: call forth thy cloudy tears: We hear thy sighs in trumpets shrill when morn shall blood renew. So sang the Spectre Sons of Albion round Luvahs Stone of Trial: Mocking and deriding at the writhings of their Victim on Salisbury: Drinking his Emanation in intoxicating bliss rejoicing in Giant dance; For a Spectre has no Emanation but what he imbibes from decieving A Victim! Then he becomes her Priest &amp; she his Tabernacle. And his Oak Grove, till the Victim rend the woven Veil. In the end of his sleep when Jesus calls him from his grave Howling the Victims on the Druid Altars yield their souls To the stern Warriors: lovely sport the Daughters round their Victims; Drinking their lives in sweet intoxication. hence arose from Bath Soft deluding odours, in spiral volutions intricately winding Over Albions mountains, a feminine indefinite cruel delusion. Astonishd: terrified &amp; in pain &amp; torment. Sudden they behold Their own Parent the Emanation of their murderd Enemy Become their Emanation and their Temple and Tabernacle They knew not. this Vala was their beloved Mother Vala Albions Wife. Terrified at the sight of the Victim: at his distorted sinews! The tremblings of Vala vibrate thro' the limbs of Albions Sons: While they rejoice over Luvah in mockery &amp; bitter scorn: Sudden they become like what they behold in howlings &amp; deadly pain. Spasms smite their features, sinews &amp; limbs: pale they look on one another. They turn, contorted: their iron necks bend unwilling towards Luvah: their lips tremble: their muscular fibres are crampd &amp; smitten They become like what they behold! Yet immense in strength &amp; power, PLATE 66 In awful pomp &amp; gold, in all the precious unhewn stones of Eden They build a stupendous Building on the Plain of Salisbury; with chains Of rocks round London Stone: of Reasonings: of unhewn Demonstrations In labyrinthine arches. (Mighty Urizen the Architect.) thro which The Heavens might revolve &amp; Eternity be bound in their chain. Labour unparallelld! a wondrous rocky World of cruel destiny Rocks piled on rocks reaching the stars: stretching from pole to pole. The Building is Natural Religion &amp; its Altars Natural Morality A building of eternal death: whose proportions are eternal despair Here Vala stood turning the iron Spindle of destruction From heaven to earth: howling! invisible! but not invisible Her Two Covering Cherubs afterwards named Voltaire &amp; Rousseau: Two frowning Rocks: on each side of the Cove &amp; Stone of Torture: Frozen Sons of the feminine Tabernacle of Bacon, Newton &amp; Locke. For Luvah is France: the Victim of the Spectres of Albion. Los beheld in terror: he pour'd his loud storms on the Furnaces: The Daughters of Albion clothed in garments of needle work Strip them off from their shoulders and bosoms, they lay aside Their garments; they sit naked upon the Stone of trial. The Knife of flint passes over the howling Victim: his blood Gushes &amp; stains the fair side of the fair Daug[h]ters of Albion. They put aside his curls; they divide his seven locks upon His forehead: they bind his forehead with thorns of iron They put into his hand a reed, they mock: Saying: Behold The King of Canaan whose are seven hundred chariots of iron! They take off his vesture whole with their Knives of flint: But they cut asunder his inner garments: searching with Their cruel fingers for his heart, &amp; there they enter in pomp, In many tears; &amp; there they erect a temple &amp; an altar: They pour cold water on his brain in front, to cause Lids to grow over his eyes in veils of tears: and caverns To freeze over his nostrils, while they feed his tongue from cups And dishes of painted clay. Glowing with beauty &amp; cruelty: They obscure the sun &amp; the moon; no eye can look upon them. Ah! alas! at the sight of the Victim, &amp; at sight of those who are smitten, All who see. become what they behold. their eyes are coverd With veils of tears and their nostrils &amp; tongues shrunk up Their ear bent outwards. as their Victim, so are they in the pangs Of unconquerable fear! amidst delights of revenge Earth-shaking! And as their eye &amp; ear shrunk, the heavens shrunk away The Divine Vision became First a burning flame, then a column Of fire, then an awful fiery wheel surrounding earth &amp; heaven: And then a globe of blood wandering distant in an unknown night: Afar into the unknown night the mountains fled away: Six months of mortality; a summer: &amp; six months of mortality; a winter: The Human form began to be alterd by the Daughters of Albion And the perceptions to be dissipated into the Indefinite. Becoming A mighty Polypus nam'd Albions Tree: they tie the Veins And Nerves into two knots: &amp; the Seed into a double knot: They look forth: the Sun is shrunk: the Heavens are shrunk Away into the far remote: and the Trees &amp; Mountains witherd Into indefinite cloudy shadows in darkness &amp; separation. By Invisible Hatreds adjoind, they seem remote and separate From each other; and yet are a Mighty Polypus in the Deep! As the Mistletoe grows on the Oak, so Albions Tree on Eternity: Lo! He who will not comingle in Love, must be adjoind by Hate They look forth from Stone-henge! from the Cove round London Stone They look on one another: the mountain calls out to the mountain: Plinlimmon shrunk away: Snowdon trembled: the mountains Of Wales &amp; Scotland beheld the descending War: the routed flying: Red run the streams of Albion: Thames is drunk with blood: As Gwendolen cast the shuttle of war: as Cambel returnd the beam. The Humber &amp; the Severn: are drunk with the blood of the slain: London feels his brain cut round: Edinburghs heart is circumscribed! York &amp; Lincoln hide among the flocks, because of the griding Knife. Worcester &amp; Hereford: Oxford &amp; Cambridge reel &amp; stagger, Overwearied with howling: Wales &amp; Scotland alone sustain the fight! The inhabitants are sick to death: they labour to divide into Days And Nights, the uncertain Periods. and into Weeks &amp; Months. In vain They send the Dove &amp; Raven: &amp; in vain the Serpent over the mountains. And in vain the Eagle &amp; Lion over the four-fold wilderness. They return not: but generate in rocky places desolate. They return not; but build a habitation separate from Man. The Sun forgets his course like a drunken man; he hesitates, Upon the Cheselden hills, thinking to sleep on the Severn In vain: he is hurried afar into an unknown Night He bleeds in torrents of blood as he rolls thro heaven above He chokes up the paths of the sky; the Moon is leprous as snow: Trembling &amp; descending down seeking to rest upon high Mona: Scattering her leprous snows in flakes of disease over Albion. The Stars flee remote: the heaven is iron, the earth is sulphur, And all the mountains &amp; hills shrink up like a withering gourd, As the Senses of Men shrink together under the Knife of flint, In the hands of Albions Daughters, among the Druid Temples. PLATE 67 By those who drink their blood &amp; the blood of their Covenant And the Twelve Daughters of Albion united in Rahab &amp; Tirzah A Double Female: and they drew out from the Rocky Stones Fibres of Life to Weave for every Female is a Golden Loom The Rocks are opake hardnesses covering all Vegetated things. And as they Wove &amp; Cut from the Looms in various divisions Stretching over Europe &amp; Asia from Ireland to Japan They divided into many lovely Daughters to be counterparts To those they Wove, for when they Wove a Male, they divided Into a Female to the Woven Male. in opake hardness They cut the Fibres from the Rocks groaning in pain they Weave; Calling the Rocks Atomic Origins of Existence; denying Eternity By the Atheistical Epicurean Philosophy of Albions Tree Such are the Feminine &amp; Masculine when separated from Man They call the Rocks Parents of Men, &amp; adore the frowning Chaos Dancing around in howling pain clothed in the bloody Veil. Hiding Albions Sons within the Veil, closing Jerusalems Sons without; to feed with their Souls the Spectres of Albion Ashamed to give Love openly to the piteous &amp; merciful Man Counting him an imbecile mockery: but the Warrior They adore: &amp; his revenge cherish with the blood of the Innocent They drink up Dan &amp; Gad, to feed with milk Skofeld &amp; Kotope They strip off Josephs Coat &amp; dip it in the blood of battle Tirzah sits weeping to hear the shrieks of the dying: her Knife Of flint is in her hand: she passes it over the howling Victim[.] The Daughters Weave their Work in loud cries over the Rock Of Horeb! still eyeing Albions Cliffs eagerly siezing &amp; twisting The threads of Vala &amp; Jerusalem running from mountain to mountain Over the whole Earth: loud the Warriors rage in Beth Peor Beneath the iron whips of their Captains &amp; consecrated banners Loud the Sun &amp; Moon rage in the conflict: loud the Stars Shout in the night of battle &amp; their spears grow to their hands With blood, weaving the deaths of the Mighty into a Tabernacle For Rahab &amp; Tirzah; till the Great Polypus of Generation covered the Earth. In Verulam the Polypus's Head, winding around his bulk Thro Rochester, and Chichester, &amp; Exeter &amp; Salisbury, To Bristol: &amp; his Heart beat strong on Salisbury Plain Shooting out Fibres round the Earth, thro Gaul &amp; Italy And Greece, &amp; along the Sea of Rephaim into Judea To Sodom &amp; Gomorrha: thence to India, China &amp; Japan The Twelve Daughters in Rahab &amp; Tirzah have circumscribd the Brain Beneath &amp; pierced it thro the midst with a golden pin. Blood hath staind her fair side beneath her bosom. O thou poor Human Form! said she. O thou poor child of woe! Why wilt thou wander away from Tirzah: why me compel to bind thee? If thou dost go away from me I shall consume upon these Rocks[.] These fibres of thine eyes that used to beam in distant heavens Away from me: I have bound down with a hot iron. These nostrils that expanded with delight in morning skies I have bent downward with lead melted in my roaring furnaces Of affliction; of love; of sweet despair; of torment unendurable My soul is seven furnaces, incessant roars the bellows Upon my terribly flaming heart, the molten metal runs In channels thro my fiery limbs: O love! O pity! O fear! O pain! O the pangs, the bitter pangs of love forsaken Ephraim was a wilderness of joy where all my wild beasts ran The River Kanah wanderd by my sweet Manassehs side To see the boy spring into heavens sounding from my sight! Go Noah fetch the girdle of strong brass, heat it red-hot: Press it around the loins of this ever expanding cruelty Shriek not so my only love! I refuse thy joys: I drink Thy shrieks because Hand &amp; Hyle are cruel &amp; obdurate to me PLATE 68 O Skofield why art thou cruel? Lo Joseph is thine! to make You One: to weave you both in the same mantle of skin Bind him down Sisters bind him down on Ebal. Mount of cursing: Malah come forth from Lebanon: &amp; Hoglah from Mount Sinai: Come circumscribe this tongue of sweets &amp; with a screw of iron Fasten this ear into the rock! Milcah the task is thine Weep not so Sisters! weep not so! our life depends on this Or mercy &amp; truth are fled away from Shechem &amp; Mount Gilead Unless my beloved is bound upon the Stems of Vegetation And thus the Warriors cry, in the hot day of Victory, in Songs. Look: the beautiful Daughter of Albion sits naked upon the Stone Her panting Victim beside her: her heart is drunk with blood Tho her brain is not drunk with wine: she goes forth from Albion In pride of beauty: in cruelty of holiness: in the brightness Of her tabernacle, &amp; her ark &amp; secret place, the beautiful Daughter Of Albion, delights the eyes of the Kings. their hearts &amp; the Hearts of their Warriors glow hot before Thor &amp; Friga. O Molech! O Chemosh! O Bacchus! O Venus! O Double God of Generation The Heavens are cut like a mantle around from the Cliffs of Albion Across Europe; across Africa; in howlings &amp; deadly War A sheet &amp; veil &amp; curtain of blood is let down from Heaven Across the hills of Ephraim &amp; down Mount Olivet to The Valley of the Jebusite: Molech rejoices in heaven He sees the Twelve Daughters naked upon the Twelve Stones Themselves condensing to rocks &amp; into the Ribs of a Man Lo they shoot forth in tender Nerves across Europe &amp; Asia Lo they rest upon the Tribes, where their panting Victims lie[.] Molech rushes into the Kings in love to the beautiful Daughters But they frown &amp; delight in cruelty, refusing all other joy Bring your Offerings, your first begotten: pamperd with milk &amp; blood Your first born of seven years old: be they Males or Females: To the beautiful Daughters of Albion! they sport before the Kings Clothed in the skin of the Victim! blood! human blood! is the life And delightful food of the Warrior: the well fed Warriors flesh Of him who is slain in War: fills the Valleys of Ephraim with Breeding Women walking in pride &amp; bringing forth under green trees With pleasure, without pain, for their food is. blood of the Captive Molech rejoices thro the Land from Havilah to Shur: he rejoices In moral law &amp; its severe penalties: loud Shaddai &amp; Jehovah Thunder above: when they see the Twelve panting Victims On the Twelve Stones of Power, &amp; the beautiful Daughters of Albion If you dare rend their Veil with your Spear; you are healed of Love!

Going forth &amp; returning from Albions Rocks to Canaan: Devouring Jerusalem from every Nation of the Earth. Envying stood the enormous Form at variance with Itself In all its Members: in eternal torment of love &amp; jealousy: Drivn forth by Los time after time from Albions cliffy shore, Drawing the free loves of Jerusalem into infernal bondage; That they might be born in contentions of Chastity &amp; in Deadly Hate between Leah &amp; Rachel, Daughters of Deceit &amp; Fraud Bearing the Images of various Species of Contention And Jealousy &amp; Abhorrence &amp; Revenge &amp; deadly Murder. Till they refuse liberty to the Male; &amp; not like Beulah Where every Female delights to give her maiden to her husband The Female searches sea &amp; land for gratifications to the Male Genius: who in return clothes her in gems &amp; gold And feeds her with the food of Eden. hence all her beauty beams She Creates at her will a little moony night &amp; silence With Spaces of sweet gardens &amp; a tent of elegant beauty: Closed in by a sandy desart &amp; a night of stars shining. And a little tender moon &amp; hovering angels on the wing. And the Male gives a Time &amp; Revolution to her Space Till the time of love is passed in ever varying delights For All Things Exist in the Human Imagination And thence in Beulah they are stolen by secret amorous theft, Till they have had Punishment enough to make them commit Crimes[.] Hence rose the Tabernacle in the Wilderness &amp; all its Offerings, From Male &amp; Female Loves in Beulah &amp; their Jealousies But no one can consummate Female bliss in Los's World without Becoming a Generated Mortal, a Vegetating Death And now the Spectres of the Dead awake in Beulah: all The Jealousies become Murderous: uniting together in Rahab A Religion of Chastity, forming a Commerce to sell Loves, With Moral Law, an Equal Balance, not going down with decision Therefore the Male severe &amp; cruel filld with stern Revenge: Mutual Hate returns &amp; mutual Deceit &amp; mutual Fear. Hence the Infernal Veil grows in the disobedient Female: Which Jesus rends &amp; the whole Druid Law removes away From the Inner Sanctuary: a False Holiness hid within the Center, For the Sanctuary of Eden. is in the Camp: in the Outline, In the Circumference: &amp; every Minute Particular is Holy: Embraces are Cominglings: from the Head even to the Feet; And not a pompous High Priest entering by a Secret Place. Jerusalem pined in her inmost soul over Wandering Reuben As she slept in Beulahs Night hid by the Daughters of Beulah PLATE 70 And this the form of mighty Hand sitting on Albions cliffs Before the face of Albion, a mighty threatning Form. His bosom wide &amp; shoulders huge overspreading wondrous Bear Three strong sinewy Necks &amp; Three awful &amp; terrible Heads Three Brains in contradictory council brooding incessantly. Neither daring to put in act its councils, fearing each-other, Therefore rejecting Ideas as nothing &amp; holding all Wisdom To consist. in the agreements &amp; disagree[me]nts of Ideas. Plotting to devour Albions Body of Humanity &amp; Love. Such Form the aggregate of the Twelve Sons of Albion took; &amp; such Their appearance when combind: but often by birth-pangs &amp; loud groans They divide to Twelve: the key-bones &amp; the chest dividing in pain Disclose a hideous orifice; thence issuing the Giant-brood Arise as the smoke of the furnace, shaking the rocks from sea to sea. And there they combine into Three Forms, named Bacon &amp; Newton &amp; Locke, In the Oak Groves of Albion which overspread all the Earth. Imputing Sin &amp; Righteousness to Individuals; Rahab Sat deep within him hid: his Feminine Power unreveal'd Brooding Abstract Philosophy. to destroy Imagination, the Divine- -Humanity A Three-fold Wonder: feminine: most beautiful: Three-fold Each within other. On her white marble &amp; even Neck, her Heart Inorb'd and bonified: with locks of shadowing modesty, shining Over her beautiful Female features, soft flourishing in beauty Beams mild, all love and all perfection, that when the lips Recieve a kiss from Gods or Men, a threefold kiss returns From the pressd loveliness: so her whole immortal form three-fold Three-fold embrace returns: consuming lives of Gods &amp; Men In fires of beauty melting them as gold &amp; silver in the furnace[.] Her Brain enlabyrinths the whole heaven of her bosom &amp; loins To put in act what her Heart wills; O who can withstand her power Her name is Vala in Eternity: in Time her name is Rahab The Starry Heavens all were fled from the mighty limbs of Albion PLATE 71 And above Albions Land was seen the Heavenly Canaan As the Substance is to the Shadow: and above Albions Twelve Sons Were seen Jerusalems Sons: and all the Twelve Tribes spreading Over Albion. As the Soul is to the Body, so Jerusalems Sons, Are to the Sons of Albion: and Jerusalem is Albions Emanation What is Above is Within, for every-thing in Eternity is translucent: The Circumference is Within: Without, is formed the Selfish Center And the Circumference still expands going forward to Eternity. And the Center has Eternal States! these States we now explore. And these the Names of Albions Twelve Sons, &amp; of his Twelve Daughters With their Districts. Hand dwelt in Selsey &amp; had Sussex &amp; Surrey And Kent &amp; Middlesex: all their Rivers &amp; their Hills, of flocks &amp; herds: Their Villages Towns Cities Sea-Ports Temples sublime Cathedrals; All were his Friends &amp; their Sons &amp; Daughters intermarry in Beulah For all are Men in Eternity. Rivers Mountains Cities Villages, All are Human &amp; when you enter into their Bosoms you walk In Heavens &amp; Earths; as in your own Bosom you bear your Heaven And Earth, &amp; all you behold, tho it appears Without it is Within In your Imagination of which this World of Mortality is but a Shadow. Hyle dwelt in Winchester comprehending Hants Dorset Devon Cornwall. Their Villages Cities SeaPorts, their Corn fields &amp; Gardens spacious Palaces, Rivers &amp; Mountains, and between Hand &amp; Hyle arose Gwendolen &amp; Cambel who is Boadicea: they go abroad &amp; return Like lovely beams of light from the mingled affections of the Brothers The Inhabitants of the whole Earth rejoice in their beautiful light.

Hence is my Theme. O Lord my Saviour, open thou the Gates And I will lead forth thy Words, telling how the Daughters Cut the Fibres of Reuben, how he rolld apart &amp; took Root In Bashan, terror-struck Albions Sons look toward Bashan They have divided Simeon he also rolld apart in blood Over the Nations till he took Root beneath the shining Looms Of Albions Daughters in Philistea by the side of Amalek They have divided Levi: he hath shot out into Forty eight Roots Over the Land of Canaan: they have divided Judah He hath took Root in Hebron, in the Land of Hand &amp; Hyle Dan: Napthali: Gad: Asher: Issachar: Zebulun: roll apart From all the Nations of the Earth to dissipate into Non Entity I see a Feminine Form arise from the Four terrible Zoas Beautiful but terrible struggling to take a form of beauty Rooted in Shechem: this is Dinah, the youthful form of Erin The Wound I see in South Molton S[t]reet &amp; Stratford place Whence Joseph &amp; Benjamin rolld apart away from the Nations In vain they rolld apart; they are fixd into the Land of Cabul PLATE 75 And Rahab Babylon the Great hath destroyed Jerusalem Bath stood upon the Severn with Merlin &amp; Bladud &amp; Arthur The Cup of Rahab in his hand: her Poisons Twenty-seven-fold And all her Twenty-seven Heavens now hid &amp; now reveal'd Appear in strong delusive light of Time &amp; Space drawn out In shadowy pomp by the Eternal Prophet created evermore For Los in Six Thousand Years walks up &amp; down continually That not one Moment of Time be lost &amp; every revolution Of Space he makes permanent in Bowlahoola &amp; Cathedron. And these the names of the Twenty-seven Heavens &amp; their Churches Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech; these are the Giants mighty, Hermaphroditic Noah, Shem, Arphaxad, Cainan the Second, Salah, Heber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah: these are the Female Males: A Male within a Female hid as in an Ark &amp; Curtains.

But now the Starry Heavens are fled from the mighty limbs of Albion PLATE 77 To the Christians. Devils are False Religions “Saul Saul” “Why persecutest thou me.” I give you the end of a golden string, Only wind it into a ball: It will lead you in at Heavens gate, Built in Jerusalems wall. We are told to abstain from fleshly desires that we may lose no time from the Work of the Lord. Every moment lost, is a moment that cannot be redeemed every pleasure that intermingles with the duty of our station is a folly unredeemable &amp; is planted like the seed of a wild flower among our wheat. All the tortures of repentance. are tortures of self-reproach on account of our leaving the Divine Harvest to the Enemy, the struggles of intanglement with incoherent roots. I know of no other Christianity and of no other Gospel than the liberty both of body &amp; mind to exercise the Divine Arts of Imagination Imagination the real &amp; eternal World of which this Vegetable Universe is but a faint shadow &amp; in which we shall live in our Eternal or Imaginative Bodies, when these Vegetable Mortal Bodies are no more. The Apostles knew of no other Gospel. What were all their spiritual gifts? What is the Divine Spirit? is the Holy Ghost any other than an Intellectual Fountain? What is the Harvest of the Gospel &amp; its Labours? What is that Talent which it is a curse to hide? What are the Treasures of Heaven which we are to lay up for ourselves, are they any other than Mental Studies &amp; Performances? What are all the Gifts of the Gospel, are they not all Mental Gifts? Is God a Spirit who must be worshipped in Spirit &amp; in Truth and are not the Gifts of the Spirit Every-thing to Man? O ye Religious discountenance every one among you who shall pretend to despise Art &amp; Science! I call upon you in the Name of Jesus! What is the Life of Man but Art &amp; Science? is it Meat &amp; Drink? is not the Body more than Raiment? What is Mortality but the things relating to the Body, which Dies? What is Immortality but the things relating to the Spirit, which Lives Eternally! What is the Joy of Heaven but Improvement in the things of the Spirit? What are the Pains of Hell but Ignorance, Bodily Lust, Idleness &amp; devastation of the things of the Spirit[?] Answer this to yourselves, &amp; expel from among you those who pretend to despise the labours of Art &amp; Science, which alone are the labours of the Gospel: Is not this plain &amp; manifest to the thought? Can you think at all &amp; not pronounce heartily! That to Labour in Knowledge. is to Build up Jerusalem: and to Despise Knowledge, is to Despise Jerusalem &amp; her Builders. And remember: He who despises &amp; mocks a Mental Gift in another; calling it pride &amp; selfishness &amp; sin; mocks Jesus the giver of every Mental Gift, which always appear to the ignorance-loving Hypocrite, as Sins. but that which is a Sin in the sight of cruel Man, is not so in the sight of our kind God. Let every Christian as much as in him lies engage himself openly &amp; publicly before all the World in some Mental pursuit for the Building up of Jerusalem I stood among my valleys of the south And saw a flame of fire, even as a Wheel Of fire surrounding all the heavens: it went From west to east against the current of Creation and devourd all things in its loud Fury &amp; thundering course round heaven &amp; earth By it the Sun was rolld into an orb: By it the Moon faded into a globe, Travelling thro the night: for from its dire And restless fury, Man himself shrunk up Into a little root a fathom long. And I asked a Watcher &amp; a Holy-One Its Name? he answerd. It is the Wheel of Religion I wept &amp; said. Is this the law of Jesus This terrible devouring sword turning every way He answerd; Jesus died because he strove Against the current of this Wheel: its Name Is Caiaphas, the dark Preacher of Death Of sin, of sorrow, &amp; of punishment; Opposing Nature! It is Natural Religion But Jesus is the bright Preacher of Life Creating Nature from this fiery Law, By self-denial &amp; forgiveness of Sin. Go therefore, cast out devils in Christs name Heal thou the sick of spiritual disease Pity the evil, for thou art not sent To smite with terror &amp; with punishments Those that are sick, like to the Pharisees Crucifying &amp; encompassing sea &amp; land For proselytes to tyranny &amp; wrath. But to the Publicans &amp; Harlots go! Teach them True Happiness, but let no curse Go forth out of thy mouth to blight their peace For Hell is opend to Heaven; thine eyes beheld The dungeons burst &amp; the Prisoners set free. England! awake! awake! awake! Jerusalem thy Sister calls! Why wilt thou sleep the sleep of death? And close her from thy ancient walls. Thy hills &amp; valleys felt her feet, Gently upon their bosoms move: Thy gates beheld sweet Zions ways; Then was a time of joy and love. And now the time returns again: Our souls exult &amp; Londons towers, Receive the Lamb of God to dwell In Englands green &amp; pleasant bowers. PLATE 78 C[hap] 4 The Spectres of Albions Twelve Sons revolve mightily Over the Tomb &amp; over the Body: ravning to devour The Sleeping Humanity. Los with his mace of iron Walks round: loud his threats, loud his blows fall On the rocky Spectres, as the Potter breaks the potsherds; Dashing in pieces Self-righteousnesses: driving them from Albions Cliffs: dividing them into Male &amp; Female forms in his Furnaces And on his Anvils: lest they destroy the Feminine Affections They are broken. Loud howl the Spectres in his iron Furnace While Los laments at his dire labours, viewing Jerusalem, Sitting before his Furnaces clothed in sackcloth of hair; Albions Twelve Sons surround the Forty-two Gates of Erin, In terrible armour, raging against the Lamb &amp; against Jerusalem, Surrounding them with armies to destroy the Lamb of God. They took their Mother Vala, and they crown'd her with gold: They namd her Rahab, &amp; gave her power over the Earth The Concave Earth round Golgonooza in Entuthon Benython, Even to the stars exalting her Throne, to build beyond the Throne Of God and the Lamb, to destroy the Lamb &amp; usurp the Throne of God Drawing their Ulro Voidness round the Four-fold Humanity Naked Jerusalem lay before the Gates upon Mount Zion The Hill of Giants, all her foundations levelld with the dust! Her Twelve Gates thrown down: her children carried into captivity Herself in chains: this from within was seen in a dismal night Outside, unknown before in Beulah, &amp; the twelve gates were fill'd With blood; from Japan eastward to the Giants causway, west In Erins Continent: and Jerusalem wept upon Euphrates banks Disorganizd; an evanescent shade, scarce seen or heard among Her childrens Druid Temples dropping with blood wanderd weeping! And thus her voice went forth in the darkness of Philisthea. My brother &amp; my father are no more! God hath forsaken me The arrows of the Almighty pour upon me &amp; my children I have sinned and am an outcast from the Divine Presence! PLATE 79 My tents are fall'n! my pillars are in ruins! my children dashd Upon Egypts iron floors, &amp; the marble pavements of Assyria; I melt my soul in reasonings among the towers of Heshbon; Mount Zion is become a cruel rock &amp; no more dew Nor rain: no more the spring of the rock appears: but cold Hard &amp; obdurate are the furrows of the mountain of wine &amp; oil: The mountain of blessing is itself a curse &amp; an astonishment: The hills of Judea are fallen with me into the deepest hell Away from the Nations of the Earth, &amp; from the Cities of the Nations; I walk to Ephraim. I seek for Shiloh: I walk like a lost sheep Among precipices of despair: in Goshen I seek for light In vain: and in Gilead for a physician and a comforter. Goshen hath followd Philistea: Gilead hath joind with Og! They are become narrow places in a little and dark land: How distant far from Albion! his hills &amp; his valleys no more Recieve the feet of Jerusalem: they have cast me quite away: And Albion is himself shrunk to a narrow rock in the midst of the sea! The plains of Sussex &amp; Surrey, their hills of flocks &amp; herds No more seek to Jerusalem nor to the sound of my Holy-ones. The Fifty-two Counties of England are hardend against me As if I was not their Mother, they despise me &amp; cast me out London coverd the whole Earth. England encompassd the Nations: And all the Nations of the Earth were seen in the Cities of Albion: My pillars reachd from sea to sea: London beheld me come From my east &amp; from my west; he blessed me and gave His children to my breasts, his sons &amp; daughters to my knees His aged parents sought me out in every city &amp; village: They discernd my countenance with joy! they shewd me to their sons Saying Lo Jerusalem is here! she sitteth in our secret chambers Levi and Judah &amp; Issachar: Ephra[i]m, Manasseh, Gad and Dan Are seen in our hills &amp; valleys: they keep our flocks &amp; herds: They watch them in the night: and the Lamb of God appears among us! The river Severn stayd his course at my command: Thames poured his waters into my basons and baths: Medway mingled with Kishon: Thames recievd the heavenly Jordan Albion gave me to the whole Earth to walk up &amp; down; to pour Joy upon every mountain; to teach songs to the shepherd &amp; plowman I taught the ships of the Sea to sing the songs of Zion. Italy saw me, in sublime astonishment: France was wholly mine: As my garden &amp; as my secret bath; Spain was my heavenly couch: I slept in his golden hills: the Lamb of God met me there. There we walked as in our secret chamber among our little ones They looked upon our loves with joy: they beheld our secret joys: With holy raptures of adoration rapd sublime in the Visions of God: Germany; Poland &amp; the North wooed my footsteps they found My gates in all their mountains &amp; my curtains in all their vales The furniture of their houses was the furniture of my chamber Turkey &amp; Grecia saw my instr[u]ments of music, they arose They siezd the harp: the flute: the mellow horn of Jerusalems joy They sounded thanksgivings in my courts: Egypt &amp; Lybia heard The swarthy sons of Ethiopia stood round the Lamb of God Enquiring for Jerusalem: he led them up my steps to my altar: And thou America! I once beheld thee but now behold no more Thy golden mountains where my Cherubim &amp; Seraphim rejoicd Together among my little-ones. But now, my Altars run with blood! My fires are corrupt! my incense is a cloudy pestilence Of seven diseases! Once a continual cloud of salvation. rose From all my myriads; once the Four-fold World rejoicd among The pillars of Jerusalem, between my winged Cherubim: But now I am closd out from them in the narrow passages Of the valleys of destruction, into a dark land of pitch &amp; bitumen. From Albions Tomb afar and from the four-fold wonders of God Shrunk to a narrow doleful form in the dark land of Cabul; There is Reuben &amp; Gad &amp; Joseph &amp; Judah &amp; Levi, closd up In narrow vales: I walk &amp; count the bones of my beloveds Along the Valley of Destruction, among these Druid Temples Which overspread all the Earth in patriarchal pomp &amp; cruel pride Tell me O Vala thy purposes; tell me wherefore thy shuttles Drop with the gore of the slain; why Euphrates is red with blood Wherefore in dreadful majesty &amp; beauty outside appears Thy Masculine from thy Feminine hardening against the heavens To devour the Human! Why dost thou weep upon the wind among These cruel Druid Temples: O Vala! Humanity is far above Sexual organization; &amp; the Visions of the Night of Beulah Where Sexes wander in dreams of bliss among the Emanations Where the Masculine &amp; Feminine are nurs'd into Youth &amp; Maiden By the tears &amp; smiles of Beulahs Daughters till the time of Sleep is past. Wherefore then do you realize these nets of beauty &amp; delusion In open day to draw the souls of the Dead into the light. Till Albion is shut out from every Nation under Heaven. PLATE 80 Encompassd by the frozen Net and by the rooted Tree I walk weeping in pangs of a Mothers torment for her Children: I walk in affliction: I am a worm, and no living soul! A worm going to eternal torment! raisd up in a night To an eternal night of pain, lost! lost! lost! for ever! Beside her Vala howld upon the winds in pride of beauty Lamenting among the timbrels of the Warriors: among the Captives In cruel holiness, and her lamenting songs were from Arnon And Jordan to Euphrates. Jerusalem followd trembling Her children in captivity. listening to Valas lamentation In the thick cloud &amp; darkness. &amp; the voice went forth from The cloud. O rent in sunder from Jerusalem the Harlot daughter! In an eternal condemnation in fierce burning flames Of torment unendurable! and if once a Delusion be found Woman must perish &amp; the Heavens of Heavens remain no more My Father gave to me command to murder Albion In unreviving Death; my Love, my Luvah orderd me in night To murder Albion the King of Men. he fought in battles fierce He conquerd Luvah my beloved: he took me and my Father He slew them: I revived them to life in my warm bosom He saw them issue from my bosom, dark in Jealousy He burnd before me: Luvah framd the Knife &amp; Luvah gave The Knife into his daughters hand! such thing was never known Before in Albions land, that one should die a death never to be reviv'd! For in our battles we the Slain men view with pity and love: We soon revive them in the secret of our tabernacles But I Vala, Luvahs daughter, keep his body embalmd in moral laws With spices of sweet odours of lovely jealous stupefaction: Within my bosom, lest he arise to life &amp; slay my Luvah Pity me then O Lamb of God! O Jesus pity me! Come into Luvahs Tents, and seek not to revive the Dead! So sang she: and the Spindle turnd furious as she sang: The Children of Jerusalem the Souls of those who sleep Were caught into the flax of her Distaff, &amp; in her Cloud To weave Jerusalem a body according to her will A Dragon form on Zion Hills most ancient promontory The Spindle turnd in blood &amp; fire: loud sound the trumpets Of war: the cymbals play loud before the Captains With Cambel &amp; Gwendolen in dance and solemn song The Cloud of Rahab vibrating with the Daughters of Albion Los saw terrified, melted with pity &amp; divided in wrath He sent them over the narrow seas in pity and love Among the Four Forests of Albion which overspread all the Earth They go forth &amp; return swift as a flash of lightning. Among the tribes of warriors: among the Stones of power! Against Jerusalem they rage thro all the Nations of Europe Thro Italy &amp; Grecia, to Lebanon &amp; Persia &amp; India. The Serpent Temples thro the Earth, from the wide Plain of Salisbury Resound with cries of Victims, shouts &amp; songs &amp; dying groans And flames of dusky fire, to Amalek, Canaan and Moab[.] And Rahab like a dismal and indefinite hovering Cloud Refusd to take a definite form. she hoverd over all the Earth Calling the definite, sin: defacing every definite form; Invisible, or Visible, stretchd out in length or spread in breadth: Over the Temples drinking groans of victims weeping in pity, And joying in the pity, howling over Jerusalems walls. Hand slept on Skiddaws top: drawn by the love of beautiful Cambel: his bright, beaming Counterpart, divided from him And her delusive light beamd fierce above the Mountain, Soft: invisible: drinking his sighs in sweet intoxication: Drawing out fibre by fibre: returning to Albions Tree At night: and in the morning to Skiddaw; she sent him over Mountainous Wales into the Loom of Cathedron fibre by fibre: He ran in tender nerves across Europe to Jerusalems Shade, To weave Jerusalem a Body repugnant to the Lamb. Hyle on East Moor in rocky Derbyshire, rav'd to the Moon For Gwendolen: she took up in bitter tears his anguishd heart, That apparent to all in Eternity, glows like the Sun in the breast: She hid it in his ribs &amp; back: she hid his tongue with teeth In terrible convulsions pitying &amp; gratified drunk with pity Glowing with loveliness before him, becoming apparent According to his changes: she roll'd his kidneys round Into two irregular forms: and looking on Albions dread Tree, She wove two vessels of seed, beautiful as Skiddaws snow; Giving them bends of self interest &amp; selfish natural virtue: She hid them in his loins; raving he ran among the rocks, Compelld into a shape of Moral Virtue against the Lamb. The invisible lovely one giving him a form according to His Law a form against the Lamb of God opposd to Mercy And playing in the thunderous Loom in sweet intoxication Filling cups of silver &amp; crystal with shrieks &amp; cries, with groans And dolorous sobs: the wine of lovers in the Wine-press of Luvah O sister Cambel said Gwendolen, as their long beaming light Mingled above the Mountain[:] what shall we do to keep These awful forms in our soft bands: distracted with trembling PLATE 81 I have mockd those who refused cruelty &amp; I have admired The cruel Warrior. I have refused to give love to Merlin the piteous. He brings to me the Images of his Love &amp; I reject in chastity And turn them out into the streets for Harlots to be food To the stern Warrior. I am become perfect in beauty over my Warrior For Men are caught by Love: Woman is caught by Pride That Love may only be obtaind in the passages of Death. Let us look! let us examine! is the Cruel become an Infant Or is he still a cruel Warrior? look Sisters, look! O piteous I have destroyd Wandring Reuben who strove to bind my Will I have stripd off Josephs beautiful integument for my Beloved, The Cruel-one of Albion: to clothe him in gems of my Zone I have named him Jehovah of Hosts. Humanity is become A weeping Infant in ruind lovely Jerusalems folding Cloud: In Heaven Love begets Love! but Fear is the Parent of Earthly Love! And he who will not bend to Love must be subdud by Fear, PLATE 82 I have heard Jerusalems groans; from Vala's cries &amp; lamentations I gather our eternal fate: Outcasts from life and love: Unless we find a way to bind these awful Forms to our Embrace we shall perish annihilate, discoverd our Delusions. Look I have wrought without delusion: Look! I have wept! And given soft milk mingled together with the spirits of flocks Of lambs and doves, mingled together in cups and dishes Of painted clay; the mighty Hyle is become a weeping infant; Soon shall the Spectres of the Dead follow my weaving threads. The Twelve Daughters of Albion attentive listen in secret shades On Cambridge and Oxford beaming soft uniting with Rahabs cloud While Gwendolen spoke to Cambel turning soft the spinning reel: Or throwing the wingd shuttle; or drawing the cords with softest songs The golden cords of the Looms animate beneath their touches soft, Along the Island white, among the Druid Temples, while Gwendolen Spoke to the Daughters of Albion standing on Skiddaws top. So saying she took a Falshood &amp; hid it in her left hand: To entice her Sisters away to Babylon on Euphrates. And thus she closed her left hand and utterd her Falshood: Forgetting that Falshood is prophetic, she hid her hand behind her, Upon her back behind her loins &amp; thus utterd her Deceit. I heard Enitharmon say to Los! Let the Daughters of Albion Be scatterd abroad and let the name of Albion be forgotten! Divide them into three! name them Amalek Canaan &amp; Moab: Let Albion remain a desolation without an inhabitant: And let the Looms of Enitharmon &amp; the Furnaces of Los Create Jerusalem, &amp; Babylon &amp; Egypt &amp; Moab &amp; Amalek, And Helle &amp; Hesperia &amp; Hindostan &amp; China &amp; Japan. But hide America, for a Curse an Altar of Victims &amp; a Holy Place. See Sisters Canaan is pleasant, Egypt is as the Garden of Eden: Babylon is our chief desire, Moab our bath in summer: Let us lead the stems of this Tree let us plant it before Jerusalem To judge the Friend of Sinners to death without the Veil: To cut her off from America, to close up her secret Ark: And the fury of Man exhaust in War! Woman permanent remain See how the fires of our loins point eastward to Babylon Look. Hyle is become an infant Love: look! behold! see him lie! Upon my bosom. look! here is the lovely wayward form That gave me sweet delight by his torments beneath my Veil; By the fruit of Albions Tree I have fed him with sweet milk By contentions of the mighty for Sacrifice of Captives; Humanity the Great Delusion: is changd to War &amp; Sacrifice: I have naild his hands on Beth Rabbim &amp; his [feet] on Heshbons Wall: O that I could live in his sight: O that I could bind him to my arm. So saying: She drew aside her Veil from Mam-Tor to Dovedale Discovering her own perfect beauty to the Daughters of Albion And Hyle a winding Worm beneath [her Loom upon the scales. Hyle was become a winding Worm:] &amp; not a weeping Infant. Trembling &amp; pitying she screamd &amp; fled upon the wind: Hyle was a winding Worm and herself perfect in beauty: The desarts tremble at his wrath: they shrink themselves in fear. Cambel trembled with jealousy: she trembled! she envied! The envy ran thro Cathedrons Looms into the Heart Of mild Jerusalem, to destroy the Lamb of God. Jerusalem Languishd upon Mount Olivet, East of mild Zions Hill. Los saw the envious blight above his Seventh Furnace On Londons Tower on the Thames: he drew Cambel in wrath, Into his thundering Bellows, heaving it for a loud blast! And with the blast of his Furnace upon fishy Billingsgate, Beneath Albions fatal Tree, before the Gate of Los: Shewd her the fibres of her beloved to ameliorate The envy; loud she labourd in the Furnace of fire, To form the mighty form of Hand according to her will. In the Furnaces of Los &amp; in the Wine-press treading day &amp; night Naked among the human clusters: bringing wine of anguish To feed the afflicted in the Furnaces: she minded not The raging flames, tho she returnd [consumd day after day A redning skeleton in howling woe:] instead of beauty Defo[r]mity: she gave her beauty to another: bearing abroad Her struggling torment in her iron arms: and like a chain, Binding his wrists &amp; ankles with the iron arms of love. Gwendolen saw the Infant in her siste[r]s arms; she howld Over the forests with bitter tears, and over the winding Worm Repentant: and she also in the eddying wind of Los's Bellows Began her dolorous task of love in the Wine-press of Luvah To form the Worm into a form of love by tears &amp; pain. The Sisters saw! trembling ran thro their Looms! soften[in]g mild Towards London: then they saw the Furna[c]es opend, &amp; in tears Began to give their souls away in the Furna[c]es of affliction. Los saw &amp; was comforted at his Furnaces uttering thus his voice. I know I am Urthona keeper of the Gates of Heaven, And that I can at will expatiate in the Gardens of bliss; But pangs of love draw me down to my loins which are Become a fountain of veiny pipes: O Albion! my brother! PLATE 83 Corrup[t]ability appears upon thy limbs, and never more Can I arise and leave thy side, but labour here incessant Till thy awaking! yet alas I shall forget Eternity! Against the Patriarchal pomp and cruelty, labouring incessant I shall become an Infant horror. Enion! Tharmas! friends Absorb me not in such dire grief: O Albion, my brother! Jerusalem hungers in the desart! affection to her children! The scorn'd and contemnd youthful girl, where shall she fly? Sussex shuts up her Villages. Hants, Devon &amp; Wilts Surrounded with masses of stone in orderd forms, determine then A form for Vala and a form for Luvah, here on the Thames Where the Victim nightly howls beneath the Druids knife: A Form of Vegetation, nail them down on the stems of Mystery: O when shall the Saxon return with the English his redeemed brother! O when shall the Lamb of God descend among the Reprobate! I woo to Amalek to protect my fugitives[.] Amalek trembles: I call to Canaan &amp; Moab in my night watches, they mourn: They listen not to my cry, they rejo[i]ce among their warriors Woden and Thor and Friga wholly consume my Saxons: On their enormous Altars built in the terrible north: From Irelands rocks to Scandinavia Persia and Tartary: From the Atlantic Sea to the universal Erythrean. Found ye London! enormous City! weeps thy River? Upon his parent bosom lay thy little ones O Land Forsaken. Surrey and Sussex are Enitharmons Chamber. Where I will build her a Couch of repose &amp; my pillars Shall surround her in beautiful labyrinths: Oothoon? Where hides my child? in Oxford hidest thou with Antamon? In graceful hidings of error: in merciful deceit Lest Hand the terrible destroy his Affection. thou hidest her: In chaste appearances for sweet deceits of love &amp; modesty Immingled, interwoven, glistening to the sickening sight. Let Cambel and her Sisters sit within the Mundane Shell: Forming the fluctuating Globe according to their will. According as they weave the little embryon nerves &amp; veins The Eye, the little Nostrils, &amp; the delicate Tongue &amp; Ears Of labyrinthine intricacy: so shall they fold the World That whatever is seen upon the Mundane Shell, the same Be seen upon the Fluctuating Earth woven by the Sisters. And sometimes the Earth shall roll in the Abyss &amp; sometimes Stand in the Center &amp; sometimes stretch flat in the Expanse, According to the will of the lovely Daughters of Albion. Sometimes it shall assimilate with mighty Golgonooza: Touching its summits: &amp; sometimes divided roll apart. As a beautiful Veil so these Females shall fold &amp; unfold According to their will the outside surface of the Earth An outside shadowy Surface superadded to the real Surface; Which is unchangeable for ever &amp; ever Amen: so be it! Separate Albions Sons gently from their Emanations, Weaving bowers of delight on the current of infant Thames Where the old Parent still retains his youth as I alas! Retain my youth eight thousand and five hundred years. The labourer of ages in the Valleys of Despair! The land is markd for desolation &amp; unless we plant The seeds of Cities &amp; of Villages in the Human bosom Albion must be a rock of blood: mark ye the points Where Cities shall remain &amp; where Villages[;] for the rest! It must lie in confusion till Albions time of awaking. Place the Tribes of Llewellyn in America for a hiding place! Till sweet Jerusalem emanates again into Eternity The night falls thick: I go upon my watch: be attentive: The Sons of Albion go forth; I follow from my Furnaces: That they return no more: that a place be prepard on Euphrates Listen to your Watchmans voice: sleep not before the Furnaces Eternal Death stands at the door. O God pity our labours. So Los spoke. to the Daughters of Beulah while his Emanation Like a faint rainbow waved before him in the awful gloom Of London city on the Thames from Surrey Hills to Highgate: Swift turn the silver spindles, &amp; the golden weights play soft And lulling harmonies beneath the Looms, from Caithness in the north To Lizard-point &amp; Dover in the south: his Emanation Joy'd in the many weaving threads in bright Cathedrons Dome Weaving the Web of life for Jerusalem. the Web of life Down flowing into Entuthons Vales glistens with soft affections. While Los arose upon his Watch, and down from Golgonooza Putting on his golden sandals to walk from mountain to mountain, He takes his way, girding himself with gold &amp; in his hand Holding his iron mace: The Spectre remains attentive Alternate they watch in night: alternate labour in day Before the Furnaces labouring, while Los all night watches The stars rising &amp; setting, &amp; the meteors &amp; terrors of night! With him went down the Dogs of Leutha, at his feet They lap the water of the trembling Thames then follow swift And thus he heard the voice of Albions daughters on Euphrates, Our Father Albions land: O it was a lovely land! &amp; the Daughters of Beulah Walked up and down in its green mountains: but Hand is fled Away: &amp; mighty Hyle: &amp; after them Jerusalem is gone: Awake PLATE 84 Highgates heights &amp; Hampsteads, to Poplar Hackney &amp; Bow: To Islington &amp; Paddington &amp; the Brook of Albions River We builded Jerusalem as a City &amp; a Temple; from Lambeth We began our Foundations; lovely Lambeth! O lovely Hills Of Camberwell, we shall behold you no more in glory &amp; pride For Jerusalem lies in ruins &amp; the Furnaces of Los are builded there You are now shrunk up to a narrow Rock in the midst of the Sea But here we build Babylon on Euphrates, compelld to build And to inhabit, our Little-ones to clothe in armour of the gold Of Jerusalems Cherubims &amp; to forge them swords of her Altars I see London blind &amp; age-bent begging thro the Streets Of Babylon, led by a child. his tears run down his beard The voice of Wandering Reuben ecchoes from street to street In all the Cities of the Nations Paris Madrid Amsterdam The Corner of Broad Street weeps; Poland Street languishes To Great Queen Street &amp; Lincolns Inn, all is distress &amp; woe. [three lines gouged out irrecoverably] The night falls thick Hand comes from Albion in his strength He combines into a Mighty-one the Double Molech &amp; Chemosh Marching thro Egypt in his fury the East is pale at his course The Nations of India, the Wild Tartar that never knew Man Starts from his lofty places &amp; casts down his tents &amp; flees away But we woo him all the night in songs, O Los come forth O Los Divide us from these terrors &amp; give us power them to subdue Arise upon thy Watches let us see thy Globe of fire On Albions Rocks &amp; let thy voice be heard upon Euphrates. Thus sang the Daughters in lamentation, uniting into One With Rahab as she turnd the iron Spindle of destruction. Terrified at the Sons of Albion they took the Falshood which Gwendolen hid in her left hand. it grew &amp; grew till it PLATE 85 Became a Space &amp; an Allegory around the Winding Worm[.] They namd it Canaan &amp; built for it a tender Moon Los smild with joy thinking on Enitharmon &amp; he brought Reuben from his twelvefold wandrings &amp; led him into it Planting the Seeds of the Twelve Tribes &amp; Moses &amp; David And gave a Time &amp; Revolution to the Space Six Thousand Years He calld it Divine Analogy, for in Beulah the Feminine Emanations Create Space. the Masculine Create Time, &amp; plant The Seeds of beauty in the Space: listning to their lamentation Los walks upon his ancient Mountains in the deadly darkness Among his Furnaces directing his laborious Myriads watchful Looking to the East: &amp; his voice is heard over the whole Earth As he watches the Furnaces by night, &amp; directs the labourers And thus Los replies upon his Watch: the Valleys listen silent: The Stars stand still to hear: Jerusalem &amp; Vala cease to mourn: His voice is heard from Albion: the Alps &amp; Appenines Listen: Hermon &amp; Lebanon bow their crowned heads Babel &amp; Shinar look toward the Western Gate, they sit down Silent at his voice: they view the red Globe of fire in Los's hand As he walks from Furnace to Furnace directing the Labourers And this is the Song of Los, the Song that he sings on his Watch O lovely mild Jerusalem! O Shiloh of Mount Ephraim! I see thy Gates of precious stones: thy Walls of gold &amp; silver: Thou art the soft reflected Image of the Sleeping Man Who stretchd on Albions rocks reposes amidst his Twenty-eight Cities: where Beulah lovely terminates, in the hills &amp; valleys of Albion Cities not yet embodied in Time and Space: plant ye The Seeds O Sisters in the bosom of Time &amp; Spaces womb To spring up for Jerusalem: lovely Shadow of Sleeping Albion Why wilt thou rend thyself apart &amp; build an Earthly Kingdom To reign in pride &amp; to opress &amp; to mix the Cup of Delusion O thou that dwellest with Babylon! Come forth O lovely-one PLATE 86 I see thy Form O lovely mild Jerusalem, Wingd with Six Wings In the opacous Bosom of the Sleeper, lovely Three-fold In Head &amp; Heart &amp; Reins three Universes of love &amp; beauty Thy forehead bright: Holiness to the Lord, with Gates of pearl Reflects Eternity beneath thy azure wings of feathery down Ribbd delicate &amp; clothd with featherd gold &amp; azure &amp; purple From thy white shoulders shadowing, purity in holiness! Thence featherd with soft crimson of the ruby bright as fire Spreading into the azure Wings which like a canopy Bends over thy immortal Head in which Eternity dwells Albion beloved Land; I see thy mountains &amp; thy hills And valleys &amp; thy pleasant Cities Holiness to the Lord I see the Spectres of thy Dead O Emanation of Albion. Thy Bosom white, translucent coverd with immortal gems A sublime ornament not obscuring the outlines of beauty Terrible to behold for thy extreme beauty &amp; perfection Twelve-fold here all the Tribes of Israel I behold Upon the Holy Land: I see the River of Life &amp; Tree of Life I see the New Jerusalem descending out of Heaven Between thy Wings of gold &amp; silver featherd immortal Clear as the rainbow, as the cloud of the Suns tabernacle Thy Reins coverd with Wings translucent sometimes covering And sometimes spread abroad reveal the flames of holiness Which like a robe covers: &amp; like a Veil of Seraphim In flaming fire unceasing burns from Eternity to Eternity Twelvefold I there behold Israel in her Tents A Pillar of a Cloud by day: a Pillar of fire by night Guides them: there I behold Moab &amp; Ammon &amp; Amalek There Bells of silver round thy knees living articulate Comforting sounds of love &amp; harmony &amp; on thy feet Sandals of gold &amp; pearl, &amp; Egypt &amp; Assyria before me The Isles of Javan, Philistea, Tyre and Lebanon Thus Los sings upon his Watch walking from Furnace to Furnace. He siezes his Hammer every hour, flames surround him as He beats: seas roll beneath his feet, tempests muster Arou[n]d his head. the thick hail stones stand ready to obey His voice in the black cloud, his Sons labour in thunders At his Furnaces; his Daughters at their Looms sing woes[.] His Emanation separates in milky fibres agonizing Among the golden Looms of Cathedron sending fibres of love From Golgonooza with sweet visions for Jerusalem, wanderer. Nor can any consummate bliss without being Generated On Earth; of those whose Emanations weave the loves Of Beulah for Jerusalem &amp; Shiloh, in immortal Golgonooza Concentering in the majestic form of Erin in eternal tears Viewing the Winding Worm on the Desarts of Great Tartary Viewing Los in his shudderings, pouring balm on his sorrows So dread is Los's fury, that none dare him to approach Without becoming his Children in the Furnaces of affliction And Enitharmon like a faint rainbow waved before him Filling with Fibres from his loins which reddend with desire Into a Globe of blood beneath his bosom trembling in darkness Of Albions clouds. he fed it, with his tears &amp; bitter groans Hiding his Spectre in invisibility from the timorous Shade Till it became a separated cloud of beauty grace &amp; love Among the darkness of his Furnaces dividing asunder till She separated stood before him a lovely Female weeping Even Enitharmon separated outside, &amp; his Loins closed And heal'd after the separation: his pains he soon forgot: Lured by her beauty outside of himself in shadowy grief. Two Wills they had; Two Intellects: &amp; not as in times of old. Silent they wanderd hand in hand like two Infants wandring From Enion in the desarts, terrified at each others beauty Envying each other yet desiring, in all devouring Love, PLATE 87 Repelling weeping Enion blind &amp; age-bent into the fourfold Desarts. Los first broke silence &amp; began to utter his love O lovely Enitharmon: I behold thy graceful forms Moving beside me till intoxicated with the woven labyrinth Of beauty &amp; perfection my wild fibres shoot in veins Of blood thro all my nervous limbs. soon overgrown in roots I shall be closed from thy sight. sieze therefore in thy hand The small fibres as they shoot around me draw out in pity And let them run on the winds of thy bosom: I will fix them With pulsations. we will divide them into Sons &amp; Daughters To live in thy Bosoms translucence as in an eternal morning Enitharmon answerd. No! I will sieze thy Fibres &amp; weave Them: not as thou wilt but as I will, for I will Create A round Womb beneath my bosom lest I also be overwoven With Love; be thou assured I never will be thy slave Let Mans delight be Love; but Womans delight be Pride[.] In Eden our loves were the same here they are opposite I have Loves of my own I will weave them in Albions Spectre Cast thou in Jerusalems shadows thy Loves! silk of liquid Rubies Jacinths Crysolites: issuing from thy Furnaces. While Jerusalem divides thy care: while thou carest for Jerusalem Know that I never will be thine: also thou hidest Vala From her these fibres shoot to shut me in a Grave. You are Albions Victim, he has set his Daughter in your path PLATE 88 Los answerd sighing like the Bellows of his Furnaces I care not! the swing of my Hammer shall measure the starry round[.] When in Eternity Man converses with Man they enter Into each others Bosom (which are Universes of delight) In mutual interchange. and first their Emanations meet Surrounded by their Children. if they embrace &amp; comingle The Human Four-fold Forms mingle also in thunders of Intellect But if the Emanations mingle not; with storms &amp; agitations Of earthquakes &amp; consuming fires they roll apart in fear For Man cannot unite with Man but by their Emanations Which stand both Male &amp; Female at the Gates of each Humanity How then can I ever again be united as Man with Man While thou my Emanation refusest my Fibres of dominion? When Souls mingle &amp; join thro all the Fibres of Brotherhood Can there be any secret joy on Earth greater than this? Enitharmon answerd: This is Womans World, nor need she any Spectre to defend her from Man. I will Create secret places And the masculine names of the places Merlin &amp; Arthur. A triple Female Tabernacle for Moral Law I weave That he who loves Jesus may loathe terrified Female love Till God himself become a Male subservient to the Female. She spoke in scorn &amp; jealousy, alternate torments; and So speaking she sat down on Sussex shore singing lulling Cadences, &amp; playing in sweet intoxication among the glistening Fibres of Los: sending them over the Ocean eastward into The realms of dark death; O perverse to thyself, contrarious To thy own purposes; for when she began to weave Shooting out in sweet pleasure her bosom in milky Love Flowd into the aching fibres of Los. yet contending against him In pride sending his Fibres over to her objects of jealousy In the little lovely Allegoric Night of Albions Daughters Which stretchd abroad, expanding east &amp; west &amp; north &amp; south Thro' all the World of Erin &amp; of Los &amp; all their Children A sullen smile broke from the Spectre in mockery &amp; scorn Knowing himself the author of their divisions &amp; shrinkings, gratified At their contentions, he wiped his tears he washd his visage. The Man who respects Woman shall be despised by Woman And deadly cunning &amp; mean abjectness only, shall enjoy them For I will make their places of joy &amp; love, excrementitious[.] Continually building, continually destroying in Family feuds While you are under the dominion of a jealous Female Unpermanent for ever because of love &amp; jealousy. You shall want all the Minute Particulars of Life Thus joyd the Spectre in the dusky fires of Los's Forge, eyeing Enitharmon who at her shining Looms sings lulling cadences While Los stood at his Anvil in wrath the victim of their love And hate; dividing the Space of Love with brazen Compasses In Golgonooza &amp; in Udan-Adan &amp; in Entuthon of Urizen. The blow of his Hammer is Justice. the swing of his Hammer: Mercy. The force of Los's Hammer is eternal Forgiveness; but His rage or his mildness were vain, she scatterd his love on the wind Eastward into her own Center, creating the Female Womb In mild Jerusalem around the Lamb of God. Loud howl The Furnaces of Los! loud roll the Wheels of Enitharmon The Four Zoa's in all their faded majesty burst out in fury And fire. Jerusalem took the Cup which foamd in Vala's hand Like the red Sun upon the mountains in the bloody day Upon the Hermaphroditic Wine-presses of Love &amp; Wrath.

Of Reuben or of Benjamin, of Joseph or Judah or Levi[.] Those who dare appropriate to themselves Universal Attributes Are the Blasphemous Selfhoods &amp; must be broken asunder[.] A Vegetated Christ &amp; a Virgin Eve, are the Hermaphroditic Blasphemy, by his Maternal Birth he is that Evil-One And his Maternal Humanity must be put off Eternally Lest the Sexual Generation swallow up Regeneration Come Lord Jesus take on thee the Satanic Body of Holiness So Los cried in the Valleys of Middlesex in the Spirit of Prophecy While in Selfhood Hand &amp; Hyle &amp; Bowen &amp; Skofeld appropriate The Divine Names: seeking to Vegetate the Divine Vision In a corporeal &amp; ever dying Vegetation &amp; Corruption Mingling with Luvah in One. they become One Great Satan Loud scream the Daughters of Albion beneath the Tongs &amp; Hammer Dolorous are their lamentations in the burning Forge They drink Reuben &amp; Benjamin as the iron drinks the fire They are red hot with cruelty: raving along the Banks of Thames And on Tyburns Brook among the howling Victims in loveliness While Hand &amp; Hyle condense the Little-ones &amp; erect them into A mighty Temple even to the stars: but they Vegetate Beneath Los's Hammer, that Life may not be blotted out. For Los said: When the Individual appropriates Universality He divides into Male &amp; Female: &amp; when the Male &amp; Female, Appropriate Individuality, they become an Eternal Death. Hermaphroditic worshippers of a God of cruelty &amp; law! Your Slaves &amp; Captives; you compell to worship a God of Mercy. These are the Demonstrations of Los, &amp; the blows of my mighty Hammer So Los spoke. And the Giants of Albion terrified &amp; ashamed With Los's thunderous Words, began to build trembling rocking Stones For his Words roll in thunders &amp; lightnings among the Temples Terrified rocking to &amp; fro upon the earth, &amp; sometimes Resting in a Circle in Malden or in Strathness or Dura. Plotting to devour Albion &amp; Los the friend of Albion Denying in private: mocking God &amp; Eternal Life: &amp; in Public Collusion, calling themselves Deists, Worshipping the Maternal Humanity; calling it Nature, and Natural Religion But still the thunder of Los peals loud &amp; thus the thunder's cry These beautiful Witchcrafts of Albion are gratifyd by Cruelty PLATE 91 It is easier to forgive an Enemy than to forgive a Friend: The man who permits you to injure him, deserves your vengeance: He also will recieve it; go Spectre! obey my most secret desire: Which thou knowest without my speaking: Go to these Fiends of Righteousness Tell them to obey their Humanities, &amp; not pretend Holiness; When they are murderers: as far as my Hammer &amp; Anvil permit Go, tell them that the Worship of God, is honouring his gifts In other men: &amp; loving the greatest men best, each according To his Genius: which is the Holy Ghost in Man; there is no other God, than that God who is the intellectual fountain of Humanity; He who envies or calumniates: which is murder &amp; cruelty, Murders the Holy-one: Go tell them this &amp; overthrow their cup, Their bread, their altar-table, their incense &amp; their oath: Their marriage &amp; their baptism, their burial &amp; consecration: I have tried to make friends by corporeal gifts but have only Made enemies: I never made friends but by spiritual gifts; By severe contentions of friendship &amp; the burning fire of thought. He who would see the Divinity must see him in his Children One first, in friendship &amp; love; then a Divine Family, &amp; in the midst Jesus will appear; so he who wishes to see a Vision; a perfect Whole Must see it in its Minute Particulars; Organized &amp; not as thou O Fiend of Righteousness pretendest; thine is a Disorganized And snowy cloud: brooder of tempests &amp; destructive War. You smile with pomp &amp; rigor: you talk of benevolence &amp; virtue! I act with benevolence &amp; Virtue &amp; get murderd time after time: You accumulate Particulars, &amp; murder by analyzing, that you May take the aggregate; &amp; you call the aggregate Moral Law: And you call that Swelld &amp; bloated Form; a Minute Particular. But General Forms have their vitality in Particulars: &amp; every Particular is a Man; a Divine Member of the Divine Jesus. So Los cried at his Anvil in the horrible darkness weeping! The Spectre builded stupendous Works, taking the Starry Heavens Like to a curtain &amp; folding them according to his will Repeating the Smaragdine Table of Hermes to draw Los down Into the Indefinite, refusing to believe without demonstration[.] Los reads the Stars of Albion! the Spectre reads the Voids Between the Stars; among the arches of Albions Tomb sublime Rolling the Sea in rocky paths: forming Leviathan And Behemoth: the War by Sea enormous &amp; the War By Land astounding: erecting pillars in the deepest Hell, To reach the heavenly arches; Los beheld undaunted furious His heavd Hammer; he swung it round &amp; at one blow, In unpitying ruin driving down the pyramids of pride Smiting the Spectre on his Anvil &amp; the integuments of his Eye And Ear unbinding in dire pain, with many blows, Of strict severity self-subduing, &amp; with many tears labouring. Then he sent forth the Spectre all his pyramids were grains Of sand &amp; his pillars: dust on the flys wing: &amp; his starry Heavens; a moth of gold &amp; silver mocking his anxious grasp Thus Los alterd his Spectre &amp; every Ratio of his Reason He alterd time after time, with dire pain &amp; many tears Till he had completely divided him into a separate space. Terrified Los sat to behold trembling &amp; weeping &amp; howling I care not whether a Man is Good or Evil; all that I care Is whether he is a Wise Man or a Fool. Go! put off Holiness And put on Intellect: or my thundrous Hammer shall drive thee To wrath which thou condemnest: till thou obey my voice So Los terrified cries: trembling &amp; weeping &amp; howling! Beholding PLATE 92 What do I see? The Briton Saxon Roman Norman amalgamating In my Furnaces into One Nation the English: &amp; taking refuge In the Loins of Albion. The Canaanite united with the fugitive Hebrew, whom she divided into Twelve, &amp; sold into Egypt Then scatterd the Egyptian &amp; Hebrew to the four Winds! This sinful Nation Created in our Furnaces &amp; Looms is Albion So Los spoke. Enitharmon answerd in great terror in Lambeths Vale The Poets Song draws to its period &amp; Enitharmon is no more. For if he be that Albion I can never weave him in my Looms But when he touches the first fibrous thread, like filmy dew My Looms will be no more &amp; I annihilate vanish for ever Then thou wilt Create another Female according to thy Will. Los answerd swift as the shuttle of gold. Sexes must vanish &amp; cease To be, when Albion arises from his dread repose O lovely Enitharmon: When all their Crimes, their Punishments their Accusations of Sin: All their Jealousies Revenges. Murders. hidings of Cruelty in Deceit Appear only in the Outward Spheres of Visionary Space and Time. In the shadows of Possibility by Mutual Forgiveness forevermore And in the Vision &amp; in the Prophecy, that we may Foresee &amp; Avoid The terrors of Creation &amp; Redemption &amp; Judgment. Beholding them Displayd in the Emanative Visions of Canaan in Jerusalem &amp; in Shiloh And in the Shadows of Remembrance, &amp; in the Chaos of the Spectre Amalek, Edom, Egypt, Moab, Ammon, Ashur, Philistea, around Jerusalem Where the Druids reard their Rocky Circles to make permanent Remembrance Of Sin. &amp; the Tree of Good &amp; Evil sprang from the Rocky Circle &amp; Snake Of the Druid, along the Valley of Rephaim from Camberwell to Golgotha And framed the Mundane Shell Cavernous in Length Bredth &amp; Highth PLATE 93 Enitharmon heard. She raisd her head like the mild Moon O Rintrah! O Palamabron! What are your dire &amp; awful purposes Enitharmons name is nothing before you: you forget all my Love! The Mothers love of obedience is forgotten &amp; you seek a Love Of the pride of dominion, that will Divorce Ocalythron &amp; Elynittria Upon East Moor in Derbyshire &amp; along the Valleys of Cheviot Could you Love me Rintrah, if you Pride not in my Love As Reuben found Mandrakes in the field &amp; gave them to his Mother Pride meets with Pride upon the Mountains in the stormy day In that terrible Day of Rintrahs Plow &amp; of Satans driving the Team. Ah! then I heard my little ones weeping along the Valley! Ah! then I saw my beloved ones fleeing from my Tent Merlin was like thee Rintrah among the Giants of Albion Judah was like Palamabron: O Simeon!

A POEM, IN SEVEN BOOKS. BOOK THE FIRST. LONDON: Printed for J. Johnson, N? 72, St Paul's Church-yard. MDCCXCI. Price One Shilling. The dead brood over Europe, the cloud and vision descends over chearful France; O cloud well appointed! Sick, sick: the Prince on his couch, wreath'd in dim And appalling mist; his strong hand outstretch'd, from his shoulder down the bone Runs aching cold into the scepter too heavy for mortal grasp. No more To be swayed by visible hand, nor in cruelty bruise the mild flourishing mountains. Sick the mountains, and all their vineyards weep, in the eyes of the kingly mourner; Pale is the morning cloud in his visage. Rise, Necker: the ancient dawn calls us To awake from slumbers of five thousand years. I awake, but my soul is in dreams; From my window I see the old mountains of France, like aged men, fading away. Troubled, leaning on Necker, descends the King, to his chamber of council; shady mountains In fear, utter voices of thunder; the woods of France embosom the sound; Clouds of wisdom prophetic reply, and roll over the palace roof heavy. Forty men: each conversing with woes in the infinite shadows of his soul, Like our ancient fathers in regions of twilight, walk, gathering round the King; Again the loud voice of France cries to the morning, the morning prophecies to its clouds. For the Commons convene in the Hall of the Nation. France shakes! And the heavens of France Perplex'd vibrate round each careful countenance! Darkness of old times around them Utters loud despair, shadowing Paris; her grey towers groan, and the Bastile trembles. In its terrible towers the Governor stood, in dark fogs list'ning the horror; A thousand his soldiers, old veterans of France, breathing red clouds of power and dominion, Sudden seiz'd with howlings, despair, and black night, he stalk'd like a lion from tower To tower, his howlings were heard in the Louvre; from court to court restless he dragg'd His strong limbs; from court to court curs'd the fierce torment unquell'd, Howling and giving the dark command; in his soul stood the purple plague, Tugging his iron manacles, and piercing through the seven towers dark and sickly, Panting over the prisoners like a wolf gorg'd; and the den nam'd Horror held a man Chain'd hand and foot, round his neck an iron band, bound to the impregnable wall. In his soul was the serpent coil'd round in his heart, hid from the light, as in a cleft rock; And the man was confin'd for a writing prophetic: in the tower nam'd Darkness, was a man Pinion'd down to the stone floor, his strong bones scarce cover'd with sinews; the iron rings Were forg'd smaller as the flesh decay'd, a mask of iron on his face hid the lineaments Of ancient Kings, and the frown of the eternal lion was hid from the oppressed earth. In the tower named Bloody, a skeleton yellow remained in its chains on its couch Of stone, once a man who refus'd to sign papers of abhorrence; the eternal worm Crept in the skeleton. In the den nam'd Religion, a loathsome sick woman, bound down To a bed of straw; the seven diseases of earth, like birds of prey, stood on the couch, And fed on the body. She refus'd to be whore to the Minister, and with a knife smote him. In the tower nam'd Order, an old man, whose white beard cover'd the stone floor like weeds On margin of the sea, shrivel'd up by heat of day and cold of night; his den was short And narrow as a grave dug for a child, with spiders webs wove, and with slime Of ancient horrors cover'd, for snakes and scorpions are his companions; harmless they breathe His sorrowful breath: he, by conscience urg'd, in the city of Paris rais'd a pulpit, And taught wonders to darken'd souls. In the den nam'd Destiny a strong man sat, His feet and hands cut off, and his eyes blinded; round his middle a chain and a band Fasten'd into the wall; fancy gave him to see an image of despair in his den, Eternally rushing round, like a man on his hands and knees, day and night without rest: He was friend to the favourite. In the seventh tower, nam'd the tower of God, was a man Mad, with chains loose, which he dragg'd up and down; fed with hopes year by year, he pined For liberty; vain hopes: his reason decay'd, and the world of attraction in his bosom Center'd, and the rushing of chaos overwhelm'd his dark soul. He was confin'd For a letter of advice to a King, and his ravings in winds are heard over Versailles. But the dens shook and trembled, the prisoners look up and assay to shout; they listen, Then laugh in the dismal den, then are silent, and a light walks round the dark towers. For the Commons convene in the Hall of the Nations; like spirits of fire in the beautiful Porches of the Sun, to plant beauty in the desart craving abyss, they gleam On the anxious city; all children new-born first behold them; tears are fled, And they nestle in earth-breathing bosoms. So the city of Paris, their wives and children, Look up to the morning Senate, and visions of sorrow leave pensive streets. But heavy brow'd jealousies lower o'er the Louvre, and terrors of ancient Kings Descend from the gloom and wander thro' the palace, and weep round the King and his Nobles. While loud thunders roll, troubling the dead, Kings are sick throughout all the earth, The voice ceas'd: the Nation sat: And the triple forg'd fetters of times were unloos'd. The voice ceas'd: the Nation sat: but ancient darkness and trembling wander thro' the palace. As in day of havock and routed battle, among thick shades of discontent, On the soul-skirting mountains of sorrow cold waving: the Nobles fold round the King, Each stern visage lock'd up as with strong bands of iron, each strong limb bound down as with marble, In flames of red wrath burning, bound in astonishment a quarter of an hour. Then the King glow'd: his Nobles fold round, like the sun of old time quench'd in clouds; In their darkness the King stood, his heart flam'd, and utter'd a with'ring heat, and these words burst forth: “The nerves of five thousand years ancestry tremble, shaking the heavens of France; “Throbs of anguish beat on brazen war foreheads, they descend and look into their graves. “I see thro' darkness, thro' clouds rolling round me, the spirits of ancient Kings “Shivering over their bleached bones; round them their counsellors look up from the dust, “Crying: ‘Hide from the living! Our bonds and our prisoners shout in the open field, “‘Hide in the nether earth! Hide in the bones! Sit obscured in the hollow scull. “‘Our flesh is corrupted, and we [wear] away. We are not numbered among the living. Let us hide “‘In stones, among roots of trees. The prisoners have burst their dens, “‘Let us hide; let us hide in the dust; and plague and wrath and tempest shall cease.’” He ceas'd, silent pond'ring, his brows folded heavy, his forehead was in affliction, Like the central fire: from the window he saw his vast armies spread over the hills, Breathing red fires from man to man, and from horse to horse; then his bosom Expanded like starry heaven, he sat down: his Nobles took their ancient seats. Then the ancientest Peer, Duke of Burgundy, rose from the Monarch's right hand, red as wines From his mountains, an odor of war, like a ripe vineyard, rose from his garments, And the chamber became as a clouded sky; o'er the council he stretch'd his red limbs, Cloth'd in flames of crimson, as a ripe vineyard stretches over sheaves of corn, The fierce Duke hung over the council; around him croud, weeping in his burning robe, A bright cloud of infant souls; his words fall like purple autumn on the sheaves. “Shall this marble built heaven become a clay cottage, this earth an oak stool, and these mowers “From the Atlantic mountains, mow down all this great starry harvest of six thousand years? “And shall Necker, the hind of Geneva, stretch out his crook'd sickle o'er fertile France, “Till our purple and crimson is faded to russet, and the kingdoms of earth bound in sheaves, “And the ancient forests of chivalry hewn, and the joys of the combat burnt for fuel; “Till the power and dominion is rent from the pole, sword and scepter from sun and moon, “The law and gospel from fire and air, and eternal reason and science “From the deep and the solid, and man lay his faded head down on the rock “Of eternity, where the eternal lion and eagle remain to devour? “This to prevent, urg'd by cries in day, and prophetic dreams hovering in night, “To enrich the lean earth that craves, furrow'd with plows; whose seed is departing from her; “Thy Nobles have gather'd thy starry hosts round this rebellious city, “To rouze up the ancient forests of Europe, with clarions of loud breathing war; “To hear the horse neigh to the drum and trumpet, and the trumpet and war shout reply; “Stretch the hand that beckons the eagles of heaven; they cry over Paris, and wait “Till Fayette point his finger to Versailles; the eagles of heaven must have their prey.” He ceas'd, and burn'd silent, red clouds roll round Necker, a weeping is heard o'er the palace; Like a dark cloud Necker paus'd, and like thunder on the just man's burial day he paus'd; Silent sit the winds, silent the meadows, while the husbandman and woman of weakness And bright children look after him into the grave, and water his clay with love, Then turn towards pensive fields; so Necker paus'd, and his visage was cover'd with clouds. The King lean'd on his mountains, then lifted his head and look'd on his armies, that shone Through heaven, tinging morning with beams of blood, then turning to Burgundy troubled: “Burgundy, thou wast born a lion! My soul is o'ergrown with distress “For the Nobles of France, and dark mists roll round me and blot the writing of God “Written in my bosom. Necker rise, leave the kingdom, thy life is surrounded with snares; “We have call'd an Assembly, but not to destroy; we have given gifts, not to the weak; “I hear rushing of muskets, and bright'ning of swords, and visages redd'ning with war, “Frowning and looking up from brooding villages and every dark'ning city; “Ancient wonders frown over the kingdom, and cries of women and babes are heard, “And tempests of doubt roll around me, and fierce sorrows, because of the Nobles of France; “Depart, answer not, for the tempest must fall, as in years that are passed away.” Dropping a tear the old man his place left, and when he was gone out He set his face toward Geneva to flee, and the women and children of the city Kneel'd round him and kissed his garments and wept; he stood a short space in the street, Then fled; and the whole city knew he was fled to Geneva, and the Senate heard it. But the Nobles burn'd wrathful at Necker's departure, and wreath'd their clouds and waters In dismal volumes; as risen from beneath the Archbishop of Paris arose, In the rushing of scales and hissing of flames and rolling of sulphurous smoke. “Hearken, Monarch of France, to the terrors of heaven, and let thy soul drink of my counsel; “Sleeping at midnight in my golden tower, the repose of the labours of men “Wav'd its solemn cloud over my head. I awoke; a cold hand passed over my limbs, and behold “An aged form, white as snow, hov'ring in mist, weeping in the uncertain light, “Dim the form almost faded, tears fell down the shady cheeks; at his feet many cloth'd “In white robes, strewn in air censers and harps, silent they lay prostrated; “Beneath, in the awful void, myriads descending and weeping thro' dismal winds, “Endless the shady train shiv'ring descended, from the gloom where the aged form wept. “At length, trembling, the vision sighing, in a low voice, like the voice of the grasshopper whisper'd: “‘My groaning is heard in the abbeys, and God, so long worshipp'd, departs as a lamp “‘Without oil; for a curse is heard hoarse thro' the land, from a godless race “‘Descending to beasts; they look downward and labour and forget my holy law; “‘The sound of prayer fails from lips of flesh, and the holy hymn from thicken'd tongues: “‘For the bars of Chaos are burst; her millions prepare their fiery way “‘Thro' the orbed abode of the holy dead, to root up and pull down and remove, “‘And Nobles and Clergy shall fail from before me, and my cloud and vision be no more; “‘The mitre become black, the crown vanish, and the scepter and ivory staff “‘Of the ruler wither among bones of death; they shall consume from the thistly field, “‘And the sound of the bell, and voice of the sabbath, and singing of the holy choir, “‘Is turn'd into songs of the harlot in day, and cries of the virgin in night. “‘They shall drop at the plow and faint at the harrow, unredeem'd, unconfess'd, unpardon'd; “‘The priest rot in his surplice by the lawless lover, the holy beside the accursed, “‘The King, frowning in purple, beside the grey plowman, and their worms embrace together.’ “The voice ceas'd, a groan shook my chamber; I slept, for the cloud of repose returned, “But morning dawn'd heavy upon me. I rose to bring my Prince heaven utter'd counsel. “Hear my counsel, O King, and send forth thy Generals, the command of Heaven is upon thee; “Then do thou command, O King, to shut up this Assembly in their final home; “Let thy soldiers possess this city of rebels, that threaten to bathe their feet “In the blood of Nobility; trampling the heart and the head; let the Bastile devour “These rebellious seditious; seal them up, O Anointed, in everlasting chains.” He sat down, a damp cold pervaded the Nobles, and monsters of worlds unknown Swam round them, watching to be delivered; When Aumont, whose chaos-born soul Eternally wand'ring a Comet and swift-falling fire, pale enter'd the chamber; Before the red Council he stood, like a man that returns from hollow graves. “Awe surrounded, alone thro' the army a fear and a with'ring blight blown by the north; “The Abbe de S[i]eyes from the Nation's Assembly. O Princes and Generals of France, “Unquestioned, unhindered, awe-struck are the soldiers; a dark shadowy man in the form “Of King Henry the Fourth walks before him in fires, the captains like men bound in chains “Stood still as he pass'd, he is come to the Louvre, O King, with a message to thee; “The strong soldiers tremble, the horses their manes bow, and the guards of thy palace are fled.” Up rose awful in his majestic beams Bourbon's strong Duke; his proud sword from his thigh Drawn, he threw on the Earth! the Duke of Bretagne and the Earl of Borgogne Rose inflam'd, to and fro in the chamber, like thunder-clouds ready to burst. “What, damp all our fires, O spectre of Henry,” said Bourbon; “and rend the flames “From the head of our King! Rise, Monarch of France; command me, and I will lead “This army of superstition at large, that the ardor of noble souls quenchless, “May yet burn in France, nor our shoulders be plow'd with the furrows of poverty.” Then Orleans generous as mountains arose, and unfolded his robe, and put forth His benevolent hand, looking on the Archbishop, who changed as pale as lead; Would have risen but could not, his voice issued harsh grating; instead of words harsh hissings Shook the chamber; he ceas'd abash'd. Then Orleans spoke, all was silent, He breath'd on them, and said, “O princes of fire, whose flames are for growth not consuming, “Fear not dreams, fear not visions, nor be you dismay'd with sorrows which flee at the morning; “Can the fires of Nobility ever be quench'd, or the stars by a stormy night? “Is the body diseas'd when the members are healthful? can the man be bound in sorrow “Whose ev'ry function is fill'd with its fiery desire? can the soul whose brain and heart “Cast their rivers in equal tides thro' the great Paradise, languish because the feet “Hands, head, bosom, and parts of love, follow their high breathing joy? “And can Nobles be bound when the people are free, or God weep when his children are happy? “Have you never seen Fayette's forehead, or Mirabeau's eyes, or the shoulders of Target, “Or Bailly the strong foot of France, or Clermont the terrible voice, and your robes “Still retain their own crimson? mine never yet faded, for fire delights in its form. “But go, merciless man! enter into the infinite labyrinth of another's brain “Ere thou measure the circle that he shall run. Go, thou cold recluse, into the fires “Of another's high flaming rich bosom, and return unconsum'd, and write laws. “If thou canst not do this, doubt thy theories, learn to consider all men as thy equals, “Thy brethern, and not as thy foot or thy hand, unless thou first fearest to hurt them.” The Monarch stood up, the strong Duke his sword to its golden scabbard return'd, The Nobles sat round like clouds on the mountains, when the storm is passing away. “Let the Nation's Ambassador come among Nobles, like incense of the valley.” Aumont went out and stood in the hollow porch, his ivory wand in his hand; A cold orb of disdain revolv'd round him, and covered his soul with snows eternal. Great Henry's soul shuddered, a whirlwind and fire tore furious from his angry bosom; He indignant departed on horses of heav'n. Then the Abbe de S[i]eyes rais'd his feet On the steps of the Louvre, like a voice of God following a storm, the Abbe follow'd The pale fires of Aumont into the chamber, as a father that bows to his son; Whose rich fields inheriting spread their old glory, so the voice of the people bowed Before the ancient seat of the kingdom and mountains to be renewed. “Hear, O Heavens of France, the voice of the people, arising from valley and hill, “O'erclouded with power. Hear the voice of vallies, the voice of meek cities, “Mourning oppressed on village and field, till the village and field is a waste. “For the husbandman weeps at blights of the fife, and blasting of trumpets consume “The souls of mild France; the pale mother nourishes her child to the deadly slaughter. “When the heavens were seal'd with a stone, and the terrible sun clos'd in an orb, and the moon “Rent from the nations, and each star appointed for watchers of night, “The millions of spirits immortal were bound in the ruins of sulphur heaven “To wander inslav'd; black, deprest in dark ignorance, kept in awe with the whip, “To worship terrors, bred from the blood of revenge and breath of desire, “In beastial forms; or more terrible men, till the dawn of our peaceful morning, “Till dawn, till morning, till the breaking of clouds, and swelling of winds, and the universal voice, “Till man raise his darken'd limbs out of the caves of night, his eyes and his heart “Expand: where is space! where O Sun is thy dwelling! where thy tent, O faint slumb'rous Moon. “Then the valleys of France shall cry to the soldier, 'throw down thy sword and musket, “‘And run and embrace the meek peasant.’ Her Nobles shall hear and shall weep, and put off “The red robe of terror, the crown of oppression, the shoes of contempt, and unbuckle “The girdle of war from the desolate earth; then the Priest in his thund'rous cloud “Shall weep, bending to earth embracing the valleys, and putting his hand to the plow, “Shall say, ‘No more I curse thee; but now I will bless thee: No more in deadly black “‘Devour thy labour; nor lift up a cloud in thy heavens, O laborious plow, “‘That the wild raging millions, that wander in forests, and howl in law blasted wastes, “‘Strength madden'd with slavery, honesty, bound in the dens of superstition, “‘May sing in the village, and shout in the harvest, and woo in pleasant gardens, “‘Their once savage loves, now beaming with knowledge, with gentle awe adorned; “‘And the saw, and the hammer, the chisel, the pencil, the pen, and the instruments “‘Of heavenly song sound in the wilds once forbidden, to teach the laborious plowman “‘And shepherd deliver'd from clouds of war, from pestilence, from night-fear, from murder, “‘From falling, from stifling, from hunger, from cold, from slander, discontent and sloth; “‘That walk in beasts and birds of night, driven back by the sandy desart “‘Like pestilent fogs round cities of men: and the happy earth sing in its course, “‘The mild peaceable nations be opened to heav'n, and men walk with their fathers in bliss.’ “‘Then hear the first voice of the morning: ‘Depart, O clouds of night, and no more “‘Return; be withdrawn cloudy war, troops of warriors depart, nor around our peaceable city “‘Breathe fires, but ten miles from Paris, let all be peace, nor a soldier be seen!’” He ended; the wind of contention arose and the clouds cast their shadows, the Princes Like the mountains of France, whose aged trees utter an awful voice, and their branches Are shatter'd, till gradual a murmur is heard descending into the valley, Like a voice in the vineyards of Burgundy, when grapes are shaken on grass; Like the low voice of the labouring man, instead of the shout of joy; And the palace appear'd like a cloud driven abroad; blood ran down the ancient pillars, Thro' the cloud a deep thunder, the Duke of Burgundy, delivers the King's command. “Seest thou yonder dark castle, that moated around, keeps this city of Paris in awe. “Go command yonder tower, saying, ‘Bastile depart, and take thy shadowy course. “‘Overstep the dark river, thou terrible tower, and get thee up into the country ten miles. “‘And thou black southern prison, move along the dusky road to Versailles; there “‘Frown on the gardens’, and if it obey and depart, then the King will disband “This war-breathing army; but if it refuse, let the Nation's Assembly thence learn, “That this army of terrors, that prison of horrors, are the bands of the murmuring kingdom.” Like the morning star arising above the black waves, when a shipwreck'd soul sighs for morning, Thro' the ranks, silent, walk'd the Ambassador back to the Nation's Assembly, and told The unwelcome message; silent they heard; then a thunder roll'd round loud and louder, Like pillars of ancient halls, and ruins of times remote they sat. Like a voice from the dim pillars Mirabeau rose; the thunders subsided away; A rushing of wings around him was heard as he brighten'd, and cried out aloud, “Where is the General of the Nation?” the walls re-echo'd: “Where is the General of the Nation?” Sudden as the bullet wrapp'd in his fire, when brazen cannons rage in the field, Fayette sprung from his seat saying, Ready! then bowing like clouds, man toward man, the Assembly Like a council of ardors seated in clouds, bending over the cities of men, And over the armies of strife, where their children are marshall'd together to battle; They murmuring divide, while the wind sleeps beneath, and the numbers are counted in silence, While they vote the removal of War, and the pestilence weighs his red wings in the sky. So Fayette stood silent among the Assembly, and the votes were given and the numbers numb'red; And the vote was, that Fayette should order the army to remove ten miles from Paris. The aged sun rises appall'd from dark mountains, and gleams a dusky beam On Fayette, but on the whole army a shadow, for a cloud on the eastern hills Hover'd, and stretch'd across the city and across the army, and across the Louvre, Like a flame of fire he stood before dark ranks, and before expecting captains On pestilent vapours around him flow frequent spectres of religious men weeping In winds driven out of the abbeys, their naked souls shiver in keen open air, Driven out by the fiery cloud of Voltaire, and thund'rous rocks of Rousseau, They dash like foam against the ridges of the army, uttering a faint feeble cry. Gleams of fire streak the heavens, and of sulphur the earth, from Fayette as he lifted his hand; But silent he stood, till all the officers rush round him like waves Round the shore of France, in day of the British flag, when heavy cannons Affright the coasts, and the peasant looks over the sea and wipes a tear; Over his head the soul of Voltaire shone fiery, and over the army Rousseau his white cloud Unfolded, on souls of war-living terrors silent list'ning toward Fayette, His voice loud inspir'd by liberty, and by spirits of the dead, thus thunder'd. “The Nation's Assembly command, that the Army remove ten miles from Paris; “Nor a soldier be seen in road or in field, till the Nation command return.” Rushing along iron ranks glittering the officers each to his station Depart, and the stern captain strokes his proud steed, and in front of his solid ranks Waits the sound of trumpet; captains of foot stand each by his cloudy drum; Then the drum beats, and the steely ranks move, and trumpets rejoice in the sky. Dark cavalry like clouds fraught with thunder ascend on the hills, and bright infantry, rank Behind rank, to the soul shaking drum and shrill fife along the roads glitter like fire. The noise of trampling, the wind of trumpets, smote the palace walls with a blast. Pale and cold sat the King in midst of his peers, and his noble heart sunk, and his pulses Suspended their motion, a darkness crept over his eye-lids, and chill cold sweat Sat round his brows faded in faint death, his peers pale like mountains of the dead, Cover'd with dews of night, groaning, shaking forests and floods. The cold newt And snake, and damp toad, on the kingly foot crawl, or croak on the awful knee, Shedding their slime, in folds of the robe the crown'd adder builds and hisses From stony brows; shaken the forests of France, sick the kings of the nations, And the bottoms of the world were open'd, and the graves of arch-angels unseal'd; The enormous dead, lift up their pale fires and look over the rocky cliffs. A faint heat from their fires reviv'd the cold Louvre; the frozen blood reflow'd. Awful up rose the king, him the peers follow'd, they saw the courts of the Palace Forsaken, and Paris without a soldier, silent, for the noise was gone up And follow'd the army, and the Senate in peace, sat beneath morning's beam.

Created by the Lamb of God around On all sides within &amp; without the Universal Man The Daughters of Beulah follow sleepers in all their Dreams Creating Spaces lest they fall into Eternal Death The Circle of Destiny complete they gave to it a Space And namd the Space Ulro &amp; brooded over it in care &amp; love They said The Spectre is in every man insane &amp; most Deformd Thro the three heavens descending in fury &amp; fire We meet it with our Songs &amp; loving blandishments &amp; give To it a form of vegetation But this Spectre of Tharmas Is Eternal Death What shall we do O God pity &amp; help So spoke they &amp; closd the Gate of the Tongue in trembling fear She drew the Spectre forth from Tharmas in her shining loom Of Vegetation weeping in wayward infancy &amp; sullen youth Listning to her soft lamentations soon his tongue began To Lisp out words &amp; soon in masculine strength augmenting he Reard up a form of gold &amp; stood upon the glittering rock A shadowy human form winged &amp; in his depths The dazzlings as of gems shone clear, rapturous in fury Glorying in his own eyes Exalted in terrific Pride Opening his rifted rocks mingling together they join in burning anguish Mingling his horrible darkness with her tender limbs then high she soard Shrieking above the ocean: a bright wonder that nature shudderd at Half Woman &amp; half beast all his darkly waving colours mix With her fair crystal clearness in her lips &amp; cheeks his metals rose In blushes like the morning &amp; his rocky features softning A wonder lovely in the heavens or wandring on the earth With female voice warbling upon the hollow vales Beauty all blushing with desire a self enjoying wonder For Enion brooded groaning loud the rough seas vegetate. Golden rocks rise from the [vortex] vast And thus her voice. Glory, delight: &amp; sweet enjoyment born To mild Eternity shut in a threefold shape delightful To wander in sweet solitude enrapturd at every wind Till with fierce pain she brought forth on the rocks her sorrow &amp; woe Behold two little Infants wept upon the desolate wind. The first state weeping they began &amp; helpless as a wave Beaten along its sightless way growing enormous in its motion to Its utmost goal, till strength from Enion like richest summer shining Raisd the bright boy &amp; girl with glories from their heads out beaming Drawing forth drooping mothers pity drooping mothers sorrow They sulk upon her breast her hair became like snow on mountains Weaker &amp; weaker, weeping woful, wearier and wearier Faded &amp; her bright Eyes decayd melted with pity &amp; love And then they wanderd far away she sought for them in vain In weeping blindness stumbling she followd them oer rocks &amp; mountains Rehumanizing from the Spectre in pangs of maternal love Ingrate they wanderd scorning her drawing her Spectrous Life Repelling her away &amp; away by a dread repulsive power Into Non Entity revolving round in dark despair. And drawing in the Spectrous life in pride and haughty joy Thus Enion gave them all her spectrous life Then Eno a daughter of Beulah took a Moment of Time And drew it out to Seven thousand years with much care &amp; affliction And many tears &amp; in Every year made windows into Eden She also took an atom of space &amp; opend its center Into Infinitude &amp; ornamented it with wondrous art Astonishd sat her Sisters of Beulah to see her soft affections To Enion &amp; her children &amp; they ponderd these things wondring And they Alternate kept watch over the Youthful terrors They saw not yet the Hand Divine for it was not yet reveald But they went on in Silent Hope &amp; Feminine repose But Los &amp; Enitharmon delighted in the Moony spaces of Eno Nine Times they livd among the forests, feeding on sweet fruits And nine bright Spaces wanderd weaving mazes of delight Snaring the wild Goats for their milk they eat the flesh of Lambs A male &amp; female naked &amp; ruddy as the pride of summer Alternate Love &amp; Hate his breast; hers Scorn &amp; Jealousy In embryon passions. they kiss'd not nor embrac'd for shame &amp; fear His head beamd light &amp; in his vigorous voice was prophecy He could controll the times &amp; seasons, &amp; the days &amp; years She could controll the spaces, regions, desart, flood &amp; forest But had no power to weave a Veil of covering for her Sins She drave the Females all away from Los And Los drave all the Males from her away They wanderd long, till they sat down upon the margind sea. Conversing with the visions of Beulah in dark slumberous bliss But the two youthful wonders wanderd in the world of Tharmas Thy name is Enitharmon; said the fierce prophetic boy While thy mild voice fills all these Caverns with sweet harmony O how our Parents sit &amp; mourn in their silent secret bowers But Enitharmon answerd with a dropping tear &amp; frowning Dark as a dewy morning when the crimson light appears To make us happy let them weary their immortal powers While we draw in their sweet delights while we return them scorn On scorn to feed our discontent; for if we grateful prove They will withhold sweet love, whose food is thorns &amp; bitter roots. We hear the warlike clarions we view the turning spheres Yet Thou in indolence reposest holding me in bonds Hear! I will sing a Song of Death! it is a Song of Vala! The Fallen Man takes his repose: Urizen sleeps in the porch Luvah and Vala woke &amp; flew up from the Human Heart Into the Brain; from thence upon the pillow Vala slumber'd. And Luvah siez'd the Horses of Light, &amp; rose into the Chariot of Day Sweet laughter siezd me in my sleep! silent &amp; close I laughd For in the visions of Vala I walkd with the mighty Fallen One I heard his voice among the branches, &amp; among sweet flowers. Why is the light of Enitharmon darken'd in dewy morn Why is the silence of Enitharmon a terror &amp; her smile a whirlwind Uttering this darkness in my halls, in the pillars of my Holy-ones Why dost thou weep as Vala? &amp; wet thy veil with dewy tears, In slumbers of my night-repose, infusing a false morning? Driving the Female Emanations all away from Los I have refusd to look upon the Universal Vision And wilt thou slay with death him who devotes himself to thee Once born for the sport &amp; amusement of Man now born to drink up all his Powers I heard the sounding sea; I heard the voice weaker and weaker; The voice came &amp; went like a dream, I awoke in my sweet bliss. Then Los smote her upon the Earth twas long eer she revivd He answer'd, darkning more with indignation hid in smiles I die not Enitharmon tho thou singst thy Song of Death Nor shalt thou me torment For I behold the Fallen Man Seeking to comfort Vala, she will not be comforted She rises from his throne and seeks the shadows of her garden Weeping for Luvah lost, in the bloody beams of your false morning Sickning lies the Fallen Man his head sick his heart faint Mighty atchievement of your power! Beware the punishment I see, invisible descend into the Gardens of Vala Luvah walking on the winds, I see the invisible knife I see the shower of blood: I see the swords &amp; spears of futurity Tho in the Brain of Man we live, &amp; in his circling Nerves. Tho' this bright world of all our joy is in the Human Brain. Where Urizen &amp; all his Hosts hang their immortal lamps Thou neer shalt leave this cold expanse where watry Tharmas mourns So spoke Los. Scorn &amp; Indignation rose upon Enitharmon Then Enitharmon reddning fierce stretchd her immortal hands Descend O Urizen descend with horse &amp; chariots Threaten not me O visionary thine the punishment The Human Nature shall no more remain nor Human acts Form the rebellious Spirits of Heaven. but War &amp; Princedom &amp; Victory &amp; Blood Night darkend as she spoke! a shuddring ran from East to West A Groan was heard on high. The warlike clarions ceast. the Spirits Of Luvah &amp; Vala shudderd in their Orb: an orb of blood! Eternity groand &amp; was troubled at the Image of Eternal Death The Wandering Man bow'd his faint head and Urizen descended And the one must have murderd the other if he had not descended Indignant muttering low thunders; Urizen descended Gloomy sounding, Now I am God from Eternity to Eternity Sullen sat Los plotting Revenge. Silent he eye'd the Prince Of Light. Silent the prince of Light viewd Los. at length a brooded Smile broke from Urizen for Enitharmon brightend more &amp; more Sullen he lowerd on Enitharmon but he smild on Los Saying Thou art the Lord of Luvah into thine hands I give The prince of Love the murderer his soul is in thine hands Pity not Vala for she pitied not the Eternal Man Nor pity thou the cries of Luvah. Lo these starry hosts They are thy servants if thou wilt obey my awful Law Los answerd furious art thou one of those who when most complacent Mean mischief most. If you are such Lo! I am also such One must be master. try thy Arts I also will try mine For I percieve Thou hast Abundance which I claim as mine Urizen startled stood but not Long soon he cried Obey my voice young Demon I am God from Eternity to Eternity Thus Urizen spoke collected in himself in awful pride Art thou a visionary of Jesus the soft delusion of Eternity Lo I am God the terrible destroyer &amp; not the Saviour Why should the Divine Vision compell the sons of Eden to forego each his own delight to war against his Spectre The Spectre is the Man the rest is only delusion &amp; fancy So spoke the Prince of Light &amp; sat beside the Seat of Los Upon the sandy shore rested his chariot of fire Ten thousand thousand were his hosts of spirits on the wind: Ten thousand thousand glittering Chariots shining in the sky: They pour upon the golden shore beside the silent ocean. Rejoicing in the Victory &amp; the heavens were filld with blood The Earth spread forth her table wide. the Night a silver cup Fill'd with the wine of anguish waited at the golden feast But the bright Sun was not as yet; he filling all the expanse Slept as a bird in the blue shell that soon shall burst away Los saw the wound of his blow he saw he pitied he wept Los now repented that he had smitten Enitharmon he felt love Arise in all his Veins he threw his arms around her loins To heal the wound of his smiting They eat the fleshly bread, they drank the nervous wine They listend to the Elemental Harps &amp; Sphery Song They view'd the dancing Hours, quick sporting thro' the sky With winged radiance scattering joys thro the ever changing light But Luvah &amp; Vala standing in the bloody sky On high remaind alone forsaken in fierce jealousy They stood above the heavens forsaken desolate suspended in blood Descend they could not. nor from Each other avert their eyes Eternity appeard above them as One Man infolded In Luvah[s] robes of blood &amp; bearing all his afflictions As the sun shines down on the misty earth Such was the Vision But purple night and crimson morning &amp; golden day descending Thro' the clear changing atmosphere display'd green fields among The varying clouds, like paradises stretch'd in the expanse With towns &amp; villages and temples, tents sheep-folds and pastures Where dwell the children of the elemental worlds in harmony. Not long in harmony they dwell, their life is drawn away And wintry woes succeed; successive driven into the Void Where Enion craves: successive drawn into the golden feast And Los &amp; Enitharmon sat in discontent &amp; scorn The Nuptial Song arose from all the thousand thousand spirits Over the joyful Earth &amp; Sea, and ascended into the Heavens For Elemental Gods their thunderous Organs blew; creating Delicious Viands. Demons of Waves their watry Eccho's woke! Bright Souls of vegetative life, budding and blossoming Stretch their immortal hands to smite the gold &amp; silver Wires And with immortal Voice soft warbling fill all Earth &amp; Heaven. With doubling Voices &amp; loud Horns wound round sounding Cavernous dwellers fill'd the enormous Revelry, Responsing! And Spirits of Flaming fire on high, govern'd the mighty Song. And This the Song! sung at The Feast of Los &amp; Enitharmon Ephraim calld out to Zion: Awake O Brother Mountain Let us refuse the Plow &amp; Spade, the heavy Roller &amp; spiked Harrow. burn all these Corn fields. throw down all these fences Fattend on Human blood &amp; drunk with wine of life is better far Than all these labours of the harvest &amp; the vintage. See the river Red with the blood of Men. swells lustful round my rocky knees My clouds are not the clouds of verdant fields &amp; groves of fruit But Clouds of Human Souls. my nostrils drink the lives of Men The Villages Lament. they faint outstretchd upon the plain Wailing runs round the Valleys from the Mill &amp; from the Barn But most the polishd Palaces dark silent bow with dread Hiding their books &amp; pictures. underneath the dens of Earth The Cities send to one another saying My sons are Mad With wine of cruelty. Let us plat a scourge O Sister City Children are nourishd for the Slaughter; once the Child was fed With Milk; but wherefore now are Children fed with blood The Horse is of more value than the Man. The Tyger fierce Laughs at the Human form. the Lion mocks &amp; thirsts for blood They cry O Spider spread thy web! Enlarge thy bones &amp; fill'd With marrow. sinews &amp; flesh Exalt thyself attain a voice Call to thy dark armd hosts, for all the sons of Men muster together To desolate their cities! Man shall be no more! Awake O Hosts The bow string sang upon the hills! Luvah &amp; Vala ride Triumphant in the bloody sky. &amp; the Human form is no more The listning Stars heard, &amp; the first beam of the morning started back He cried out to his Father, depart! depart! but sudden Siez'd And clad in steel. &amp; his Horse proudly neighd; he smelt the battle Afar off, Rushing back, reddning with rage the Mighty Father Siezd his bright Sheephook studded with gems &amp; gold, he Swung it round His head shrill sounding in the sky, down rushd the Sun with noise Of war. The Mountains fled away they sought a place beneath Vala remaind in desarts of dark solitude. nor Sun nor Moon By night nor day to comfort her, she labourd in thick smoke Tharmas endurd not, he fled howling. then a barren waste sunk down Conglobing in the dark confusion, Mean time Los was born And Thou O Enitharmon! Hark I hear the hammers of Los They melt the bones of Vala, &amp; the bones of Luvah into wedges The innumerable sons &amp; daughters of Luvah closd in furnaces Melt into furrows. winter blows his bellows: Ice &amp; Snow Tend the dire anvils. Mountains mourn &amp; Rivers faint &amp; fail There is no City nor Corn-field nor Orchard! all is Rock &amp; Sand There is no Sun nor Moon nor Star. but rugged wintry rocks Justling together in the void suspended by inward fires Impatience now no longer can endure. Distracted Luvah Bursting forth from the loins of Enitharmon, Thou fierce Terror Go howl in vain, Smite Smite his fetters Smite O wintry hammers Smite Spectre of Urthona, mock the fiend who drew us down From heavens of joy into this Deep. Now rage but rage in vain Thus Sang the Demons of the Deep. the Clarions of War blew loud The Feast redounds &amp; Crownd with roses &amp; the circling vine The Enormous Bride &amp; Bridegroom sat, beside them Urizen With faded radiance sighd, forgetful of the flowing wine And of Ahania his Pure Bride but She was distant far But Los &amp; Enitharmon sat in discontent &amp; scorn Craving the more the more enjoying, drawing out sweet bliss From all the turning wheels of heaven &amp; the chariots of the Slain At distance Far in Night repelld. in direful hunger craving Summers &amp; Winters round revolving in the frightful deep. Enion blind &amp; age-bent wept upon the desolate wind Why does the Raven cry aloud and no eye pities her? Why fall the Sparrow &amp; the Robin in the foodless winter? Faint! shivering they sit on leafless bush, or frozen stone Wearied with seeking food across the snowy waste; the little Heart, cold; and the little tongue consum'd, that once in thoughtless joy Gave songs of gratitude to waving corn fields round their nest. Why howl the Lion &amp; the Wolf? why do they roam abroad? Deluded by summers heat they sport in enormous love And cast their young out to the hungry wilds &amp; sandy desarts Why is the Sheep given to the knife? the Lamb plays in the Sun He starts! he hears the foot of Man! he says, Take thou my wool But spare my life, but he knows not that winter cometh fast. The Spider sits in his labourd Web, eager watching for the Fly Presently comes a famishd Bird &amp; takes away the Spider His Web is left all desolate, that his little anxious heart So careful wove; &amp; spread it out with sighs and weariness. This was the Lamentation of Enion round the golden Feast Eternity groand and was troubled at the image of Eternal Death Without the body of Man an Exudation from his sickning limbs Now Man was come to the Palm tree &amp; to the Oak of Weeping Which stand upon the Edge of Beulah &amp; he sunk down From the Supporting arms of the Eternal Saviour; who disposd The pale limbs of his Eternal Individuality Upon The Rock of Ages. Watching over him with Love &amp; Care Then those in Great Eternity met in the Council of God As one Man for contracting their Exalted Senses They behold Multitude or Expanding they behold as one As One Man all the Universal family &amp; that one Man They call Jesus the Christ &amp; they in him &amp; he in them Live in Perfect harmony in Eden the land of life Consulting as One Man above the Mountain of Snowdon Sublime For messengers from Beulah come in tears &amp; darkning clouds Saying Shiloh is in ruins our brother is sick Albion He Whom thou lovest is sick he wanders from his house of Eternity The daughters of Beulah terrified have closd the Gate of the Tongue Luvah &amp; Urizen contend in war around the holy tent So spoke the Ambassadors from Beulah &amp; with solemn mourning They were introducd to the divine presence &amp; they kneeled down In Conways Vale thus recounting the Wars of Death Eternal The Eternal Man wept in the holy tent Our Brother in Eternity Even Albion whom thou lovest wept in pain his family Slept round on hills &amp; valleys in the regions of his love But Urizen awoke &amp; Luvah woke &amp; thus conferrd Thou Luvah said the Prince of Light behold our sons &amp; daughters Reposd on beds. let them sleep on. do thou alone depart Into thy wished Kingdom where in Majesty &amp; Power We may erect a throne. deep in the North I place my lot Thou in the South listen attentive.

Tharmas beheld him fall Endlong a raging serpent rolling round the holy tent The sons of war astonishd at the Glittring monster drove Him far into the world of Tharmas into a cavernd rock But Urizen with darkness overspreading all the armies Sent round his heralds secretly commanding to depart Into the north Sudden with thunders sound his multitudes Retreat from the fierce conflict all the sons of Urizen at once Mustring together in thick clouds leaving the rage of Luvah To pour its fury on himself &amp; on the Eternal Man Sudden down fell they all together into an unknown Space Deep horrible without End.

Stern Urizen beheld In woe his brethren &amp; his Sons in darkning woe lamenting Upon the winds in clouds involvd Uttering his voice in thunders Commanding all the work with care &amp; power &amp; severity Then siezd the Lions of Urizen their work, &amp; heated in the forge Roar the bright masses, thund'ring beat the hammers, many a pyramid Is form'd &amp; thrown down thund'ring into the deeps of Non Entity Heated red hot they hizzing rend their way down many a league Till resting. each his [center] finds; suspended there they stand Casting their sparkles dire abroad into the dismal deep For measurd out in orderd spaces the Sons of Urizen With compasses divide the deep; they the strong scales erect That Luvah rent from the faint Heart of the Fallen Man And weigh the massy Cubes, then fix them in their awful stations And all the time in Caverns shut, the golden Looms erected First spun, then wove the Atmospheres, there the Spider &amp; Worm Plied the wingd shuttle piping shrill thro' all the list'ning threads Beneath the Caverns roll the weights of lead &amp; spindles of iron The enormous warp &amp; woof rage direful in the affrighted deep While far into the vast unknown, the strong wing'd Eagles bend Their venturous flight, in Human forms distinct; thro darkness deep They bear the woven draperies; on golden hooks they hang abroad The universal curtains &amp; spread out from Sun to Sun The vehicles of light, they separate the furious particles Into mild currents as the water mingles with the wine.

Astonishd &amp; Confounded he beheld Her shadowy form now Separate he shudderd &amp; was silent Till her caresses &amp; her tears revivd him to life &amp; joy Two wills they had two intellects &amp; not as in times of old This Urizen percievd &amp; silent brooded in darkning Clouds To him his Labour was but Sorrow &amp; his Kingdom was Repentance He drave the Male Spirits all away from Ahania And she drave all the Females from him away Los joyd &amp; Enitharmon laughd, saying Let us go down And see this labour &amp; sorrow; They went down to see the woes Of Vala &amp; the woes of Luvah, to draw in their delights And Vala like a shadow oft appeard to Urizen The King of Light beheld her mourning among the Brick kilns compelld To labour night &amp; day among the fires, her lamenting voice Is heard when silent night returns &amp; the labourers take their rest O Lord wilt thou not look upon our sore afflictions Among these flames incessant labouring, our hard masters laugh At all our sorrow. We are made to turn the wheel for water To carry the heavy basket on our scorched shoulders, to sift The sand &amp; ashes, &amp; to mix the clay with tears &amp; repentance I see not Luvah as of old I only see his feet Like pillars of fire travelling thro darkness &amp; non entity The times are now returnd upon us, we have given ourselves To scorn and now are scorned by the slaves of our enemies Our beauty is coverd over with clay &amp; ashes, &amp; our backs Furrowd with whips, &amp; our flesh bruised with the heavy basket Forgive us O thou piteous one whom we have offended, forgive The weak remaining shadow of Vala that returns in sorrow to thee. Thus she lamented day &amp; night, compelld to labour &amp; sorrow Luvah in vain her lamentations heard; in vain his love Brought him in various forms before her still she knew him not Still she despisd him, calling on his name &amp; knowing him not Still hating still professing love, still labouring in the smoke And Los &amp; Enitharmon joyd, they drank in tenfold joy From all the sorrow of Luvah &amp; the labour of Urizen And Enitharmon joyd Plotting to rend the secret cloud To plant divisions in the Soul of Urizen &amp; Ahania But infinitely beautiful the wondrous work arose In sorrow &amp; care. a Golden World whose porches round the heavens And pillard halls &amp; rooms recievd the eternal wandering stars A wondrous golden Building; many a window many a door And many a division let in &amp; out into the vast unknown [Cubed] in [window square] immoveable, within its walls &amp; cielings The heavens were closd and spirits mournd their bondage night and day And the Divine Vision appeard in Luvahs robes of blood Thus was the Mundane shell builded by Urizens strong power Sorrowing went the Planters forth to plant, the Sowers to sow They dug the channels for the rivers &amp; they pourd abroad The seas &amp; lakes, they reard the mountains &amp; the rocks &amp; hills On broad pavilions, on pillard roofs &amp; porches &amp; high towers In beauteous order, thence arose soft clouds &amp; exhalations Wandering even to the sunny Cubes of light &amp; heat For many a window ornamented with sweet ornaments Lookd out into the World of Tharmas, where in ceaseless torrents His billows roll where monsters wander in the foamy paths On clouds the Sons of Urizen beheld Heaven walled round They weighd &amp; orderd all &amp; Urizen comforted saw The wondrous work flow forth like visible out of the invisible For the Divine Lamb Even Jesus who is the Divine Vision Permitted all lest Man should fall into Eternal Death For when Luvah sunk down himself put on the robes of blood Lest the state calld Luvah should cease. &amp; the Divine Vision Walked in robes of blood till he who slept should awake Thus were the stars of heaven created like a golden chain To bind the Body of Man to heaven from falling into the Abyss Each took his station, &amp; his course began with sorrow &amp; care In sevens &amp; tens &amp; fifties, hundreds, thousands, numberd all According to their various powers.

Ahania heard the Lamentation &amp; a swift Vibration Spread thro her Golden frame. She rose up eer the dawn of day When Urizen slept on his couch. drawn thro unbounded space Onto the margin of Non Entity the bright Female came There she beheld the Spectrous form of Enion in the Void And never from that moment could she rest upon her pillow End of the Second Night VALA Night the Third Now sat the King of Light on high upon his starry throne And bright Ahania bow'd herself before his splendid feet O Urizen look on Me. like a mournful stream I Embrace round thy knees &amp; wet My bright hair with my tears: Why sighs my Lord! are not the morning stars thy obedient Sons Do they not bow their bright heads at thy voice? at thy command Do they not fly into their stations &amp; return their light to thee The immortal Atmospheres are thine, there thou art seen in glory Surrounded by the ever changing Daughters of the Light Why wilt thou look upon futurity darkning present joy She ceas'd the Prince his light obscurd &amp; the splendors of his crown Infolded in thick clouds, from whence his mighty voice burst forth O bright [Ahania] a Boy is born of the dark Ocean Whom Urizen doth serve, with Light replenishing his darkness I am set here a King of trouble commanded here to serve And do my ministry to those who eat of my wide table All this is mine yet I must serve &amp; that Prophetic boy Must grow up to command his Prince but hear my determind Decree Vala shall become a Worm in Enitharmons Womb Laying her seed upon the fibres soon to issue forth And Luvah in the loins of Los a dark &amp; furious death Alas for me! what will become of me at that dread time? Ahania bow'd her head &amp; wept seven days before the King And on the eighth day when his clouds unfolded from his throne She rais'd her bright head sweet perfumd &amp; thus with heavenly voice O Prince the Eternal One hath set thee leader of his hosts Leave all futurity to him Resume thy fields of Light Why didst thou listen to the voice of Luvah that dread morn To give the immortal steeds of light to his deceitful hands No longer now obedient to thy will thou art compell'd To forge the curbs of iron &amp; brass to build the iron mangers To feed them with intoxication from the wine presses of Luvah Till the Divine Vision &amp; Fruition is quite obliterated They call thy lions to the fields of blood, they rowze thy tygers Out of the halls of justice, till these dens thy wisdom framd Golden &amp; beautiful but O how unlike those sweet fields of bliss Where liberty was justice &amp; eternal science was mercy Then O my dear lord listen to Ahania, listen to the vision The vision of Ahania in the slumbers of Urizen When Urizen slept in the porch &amp; the Ancient Man was smitten The Darkning Man walkd on the steps of fire before his halls And Vala walkd with him in dreams of soft deluding slumber He looked up &amp; saw thee Prince of Light thy splendor faded Then Man ascended mourning into the splendors of his palace Above him rose a Shadow from his wearied intellect Of living gold, pure, perfect, holy; in white linen pure he hover'd A sweet entrancing self delusion, a watry vision of Man Soft exulting in existence all the Man absorbing Man fell upon his face prostrate before the watry shadow Saying O Lord whence is this change thou knowest I am nothing And Vala trembled &amp; coverd her face, &amp; her locks. were spread on the pavement We heard astonishd at the Vision &amp; our hearts trembled within us [We] heard the voice of the Slumberous Man &amp; thus he spoke Idolatrous to his own Shadow words of Eternity uttering O I am nothing when I enter into judgment with thee If thou withdraw thy breath I die &amp; vanish into Hades If thou dost lay thine hand upon me behold I am silent If thou withhold thine hand I perish like a fallen leaf O I am nothing &amp; to nothing must return again If thou withdraw thy breath, behold I am oblivion He ceasd: the shadowy voice was silent; but the cloud hoverd over their heads In golden wreathes, the sorrow of Man &amp; the balmy drops fell down And Lo that Son of Man, that shadowy Spirit of the Fallen One Luvah, descended from the cloud; In terror Albion rose Indignant rose the Awful Man &amp; turnd his back on Vala We heard the Voice of Albion starting from his sleep Why roll thy clouds in sick'ning mists. I can no longer hide The dismal vision of mine Eyes, O love &amp; life &amp; light! Prophetic dreads urge me to speak. futurity is before me Like a dark lamp. Eternal death haunts all my expectation Rent from Eternal Brotherhood we die &amp; are no more Whence is this voice crying Enion that soundeth in my ears O cruel pity! O dark deceit! can Love seek for dominion And Luvah strove to gain dominion over the mighty Albion They strove together above the Body where Vala was inclos'd And the dark Body of Albion left prostrate upon the crystal pavement Coverd with boils from head to foot. the terrible smitings of Luvah Then frownd the Fallen Man &amp; put forth Luvah from his presence (I heard him: frown not Urizen: but listen to my Vision) Saying, Go &amp; die the Death of Man for Vala the sweet wanderer I will turn the volutions of your Ears outward; &amp; bend your Nostrils Downward; &amp; your fluxile Eyes englob'd, roll round in fear Your withring Lips &amp; Tongue shrink up into a narrow circle Till into narrow forms you creep. Go take your fiery way And learn what 'tis to absorb the Man you Spirits of Pity &amp; Love O Urizen why art thou pale at the visions of Ahania Listen to her who loves thee lest we also are driven away. They heard the Voice &amp; fled swift as the winters setting sun And now the Human Blood foamd high, I saw that Luvah &amp; Vala Went down the Human Heart where Paradise &amp; its joys abounded In jealous fears in fury &amp; rage, &amp; flames roll'd round their fervid feet And the vast form of Nature like a Serpent play'd before them And as they went in folding fires &amp; thunders of the deep Vala shrunk in like the dark sea that leaves its slimy banks And from her bosom Luvah fell far as the east &amp; west And the vast form of Nature like a Serpent roll'd between. Whether this is Jerusalem or Babylon we know not All is confusion All is tumult &amp; we alone escaped She ended. for his wrathful throne burst forth the black hail storm Am I not God said Urizen. Who is Equal to me Do I not stretch the heavens abroad or fold them up like a garment He spoke mustering his heavy clouds around him black opake Then thunders rolld around &amp; lightnings darted to &amp; fro His visage changd to darkness &amp; his strong right hand came forth To cast Ahania to the Earth he siezd her by the hair And threw her from the steps of ice that froze around his throne Saying Art thou also become like Vala. thus I cast thee out Shall the feminine indolent bliss. the indulgent self of weariness The passive idle sleep the enormous night &amp; darkness of Death Set herself up to give her laws to the active masculine virtue Thou little diminutive portion that darst be a counterpart Thy passivity thy laws of obedience &amp; insincerity Are my abhorrence. Wherefore hast thou taken that fair form Whence is this power given to thee! once thou wast in my breast A sluggish current of dim waters. on whose verdant margin A cavern shaggd with horrid shades. dark cool &amp; deadly. where I laid my head in the hot noon after the broken clods Had wearied me. there I laid my plow &amp; there my horses fed And thou hast risen with thy moist locks into a watry image Reflecting all my indolence my weakness &amp; my death To weigh me down beneath the grave into non Entity Where Luvah strives scorned by Vala age after age wandering Shrinking &amp; shrinking from her Lord &amp; calling him the Tempter And art thou also become like Vala thus I cast thee out. So loud in thunders spoke the King folded in dark despair And threw Ahania from his bosom obdurate She fell like lightning Then fled the sons of Urizen from his thunderous throne petrific They fled to East &amp; West &amp; left the North &amp; South of Heaven A crash ran thro the immense The bounds of Destiny were broken The bounds of Destiny crashd direful &amp; the swelling Sea Burst from its bonds in whirlpools fierce roaring with Human voice Triumphing even to the Stars at bright Ahanias fall Down from the dismal North the Prince in thunders &amp; thick clouds As when the thunderbolt down falleth on the appointed place Fell down down rushing ruining thundering shuddering Into the Caverns of the Grave &amp; places of Human Seed Where the impressions of Despair &amp; Hope enroot forever A world of Darkness. Ahania fell far into Non Entity She Continued falling. Loud the Crash continud loud &amp; Hoarse From the Crash roared a flame of blue sulphureous fire from the flame A dolorous groan that struck with dumbness all confusion Swallowing up the horrible din in agony on agony Thro the Confusion like a crack across from immense to immense Loud strong a universal groan of death louder Than all the wracking elements deafend &amp; rended worse Than Urizen &amp; all his hosts in curst despair down rushing But from the Dolorous Groan one like a shadow of smoke appeard And human bones rattling together in the smoke &amp; stamping The nether Abyss &amp; gnasshing in fierce despair. panting in sobs Thick short incessant bursting sobbing. deep despairing stamping struggling Struggling to utter the voice of Man struggling to take the features of Man. Struggling To take the limbs of Man at length emerging from the smoke Of Urizen dashed in pieces from his precipitant fall Tharmas reard up his hands &amp; stood on the affrighted Ocean The dead reard up his Voice &amp; stood on the resounding shore Crying. Fury in my limbs. destruction in my bones &amp; marrow My skull riven into filaments. my eyes into sea jellies Floating upon the tide wander bubbling &amp; bubbling Uttering my lamentations &amp; begetting little monsters Who sit mocking upon the little pebbles of the tide In all my rivers &amp; on dried shells that the fish Have quite forsaken. O fool fool to lose my sweetest bliss Where art thou Enion ah too near to cunning too far off And yet too near. Dashd down I send thee into distant darkness Far as my strength can hurl thee wander there &amp; laugh &amp; play Among the frozen arrows they will tear thy tender flesh Fall off afar from Tharmas come not too near my strong fury Scream &amp; fall off &amp; laugh at Tharmas lovely summer beauty Till winter rends thee into Shivers as thou hast rended me So Tharmas bellowd oer the ocean thundring sobbing bursting The bounds of Destiny were broken &amp; hatred now began Instead of love to Enion. Enion blind &amp; age bent Plungd into the cold billows living a life in midst of waters In terrors she witherd away to Entuthon Benithon A world of deep darkness where all things in horrors are rooted These are the words of Enion heard from the cold waves of despair O Tharmas I had lost thee. &amp; when I hoped I had found thee O Tharmas do not thou destroy me quite but let A little shadow. but a little showery form of Enion Be near thee loved Terror. let me still remain &amp; then do thou Thy righteous doom upon me. only let me hear thy voice Driven by thy rage I wander like a cloud into the deep Where never yet Existence came, there losing all my life I back return weaker &amp; weaker, consume me not away In thy great wrath. tho I have sinned. tho I have rebelld Make me not like the things forgotten as they had not been Make not the thing that loveth thee. a tear wiped away Tharmas replied riding on storms his voice of Thunder rolld Image of grief thy fading lineaments make my eyelids fail What have I done! both rage &amp; mercy are alike to me Looking upon thee Image of faint waters. I recoil From my fierce rage into thy semblance. Enion return Why does thy piteous face Evanish like a rainy cloud Melting. a shower of falling tears. nothing but tears! Enion: Substanceless. voiceless, weeping. vanishd. nothing but tears! Enion Art thou for ever vanishd from the watry eyes of Tharmas Rage Rage shall never from my bosom. winds &amp; waters of woe Consuming all to the end consuming Love and Hope are ended For now no more remaind of Enion in the dismal air Only a voice eternal wailing in the Elements Where Enion, blind &amp; age bent wanderd Ahania wanders now She wanders in Eternal fear of falling into the indefinite For her bright eyes behold the Abyss. Sometimes a little sleep Weighs down her eyelids then she falls then starting wakes in fears Sleepless to wander round repelld on the margin of Non Entity The End of the Third Night Vala Night The Fourth But Tharmas rode on the dark Abyss. the voice of Tharmas rolld Over the heaving deluge. he saw Los &amp; Enitharmon Emerge In strength &amp; brightness from the Abyss his bowels yearnd over them They rose in strength above the heaving deluge. in mighty scorn Red as the Sun in the hot morning of the bloody day Tharmas beheld them his bowels yearnd over them And he said Wherefore do I feel such love &amp; pity Ah Enion Ah Enion Ah lovely lovely Enion How is this All my hope is gone for ever fled Like a famishd Eagle Eyeless raging in the vast expanse Incessant tears are now my food. incessant rage &amp; tears Deathless for ever now I wander seeking oblivion In torrents of despair in vain. for if I plunge beneath Stifling I live. If dashd in pieces from a rocky height I reunite in endless torment. would I had never risen From deaths cold sleep beneath the bottom of the raging Ocean And cannot those who once have lovd. ever forget their Love? Are love &amp; rage the same passion? they are the same in me Are those who love. like those who died. risen again from death Immortal. in immortal torment. never to be deliverd Is it not possible that one risen again from Death Can die! When dark despair comes over can I not Flow down into the sea &amp; slumber in oblivion. Ah Enion Deformd I see these lineaments of ungratified Desire The all powerful curse of an honest man be upon Urizen &amp; Luvah But thou My Son Glorious in brightness comforter of Tharmas Go forth Rebuild this Universe beneath my indignant power A Universe of Death &amp; Decay. Let Enitharmons hands Weave soft delusive forms of Man above my watry world Renew these ruind souls of Men thro Earth Sea Air &amp; Fire To waste in endless corruption. renew thou I will destroy Perhaps Enion may resume some little semblance To ease my pangs of heart &amp; to restore some peace to Tharmas Los answerd in his furious pride sparks issuing from his hair Hitherto shalt thou come. no further. here thy proud waves cease We have drunk up the Eternal Man by our unbounded power Beware lest we also drink up thee rough demon of the waters Our God is Urizen the King. King of the Heavenly hosts We have no other God but he thou father of worms &amp; clay And he is falln into the Deep rough Demon of the waters And Los remains God over all. weak father of worms &amp; clay I know I was Urthona keeper of the gates of heaven But now I am all powerful Los &amp; Urthona is but my shadow Doubting stood Tharmas in the solemn darkness. his dim Eyes Swam in red tears. he reard his waves above the head of Los In wrath. but pitying back withdrew with many a sigh Now he resolvd to destroy Los &amp; now his tears flowd down In scorn stood Los red sparks of blighting from his furious head Flew over the waves of Tharmas. pitying Tharmas stayd his Waves For Enitharmon shriekd amain crying O my sweet world Built by the Architect divine whose love to Los &amp; Enitharmon Thou rash abhorred Demon in thy fury hast oerthrown What Sovereign Architect said Tharmas dare my will controll For if I will I urge these waters. If I will they sleep In peace beneath my awful frown my will shall be my Law So Saying in a Wave he rap'd bright Enitharmon far Apart from Los. but coverd her with softest brooding care On a broad wave in the warm west. balming her bleeding wound O how Los howld at the rending asunder all the fibres rent Where Enitharmon joind to his left side in griding pain He falling on the rocks bellowd his Dolor. till the blood Stanch'd, then in ululation waild his woes upon the wind And Tharmas calld to the Dark Spectre who upon the Shores With dislocated Limbs had falln. The Spectre rose in pain A Shadow blue obscure &amp; dismal. like a statute of lead Bent by its fall from a high tower the dolorous shadow rose Go forth said Tharmas works of joy are thine obey &amp; live So shall the spungy marrow issuing from thy splinterd bones Bonify. &amp; thou shalt have rest when this thy labour is done Go forth bear Enitharmon back to the Eternal Prophet Build her a bower in the midst of all my dashing waves Make first a resting place for Los &amp; Enitharmon. then Thou shalt have rest. If thou refusest dashd abroad on all My waves. thy limbs shall separate in stench &amp; rotting &amp; thou Become a prey to all my demons of despair &amp; hope The Spectre of Urthona seeing Enitharmon writhd His cloudy form in jealous fear &amp; muttering thunders hoarse And casting round thick glooms. thus utterd his fierce pangs of heart Tharmas I know thee. how are we alterd our beauty decayd But still I know thee tho in this horrible ruin whelmd Thou once the mildest son of heaven art now become a Rage A terror to all living things. think not that I am ignorant That thou art risen from the dead or that my power forgot I slumber here in weak repose. I well remember the Day The day of terror &amp; abhorrence When fleeing from the battle thou fleeting like the raven Of dawn outstretching an expanse where neer expanse had been Drewst all the Sons of Beulah into thy dread vortex following Thy Eddying spirit down the hills of Beulah. All my sons Stood round me at the anvil where new heated the wedge Of iron glowd furious prepard for spades &amp; mattocks Hearing the symphonies of war loud sounding All my sons Fled from my side then pangs smote me unknown before. I saw My loins begin to break forth into veiny pipes &amp; writhe Before me in the wind englobing trembling with strong vibrations The bloody mass began to animate. I bending over Wept bitter tears incessant. Still beholding how the piteous form Dividing &amp; dividing from my loins a weak &amp; piteous Soft cloud of snow a female pale &amp; weak I soft embracd My counter part &amp; calld it Love I named her Enitharmon But found myself &amp; her together issuing down the tide Which now our rivers were become delving thro caverns huge Of goary blood strugg[l]ing to be deliverd from our bonds She strove in vain not so Urthona strove for breaking forth, A shadow blue obscure &amp; dismal from the breathing Nostrils Of Enion I issued into the air divided from Enitharmon I howld in sorrow I beheld thee rotting upon the Rocks I pitying hoverd over thee I protected thy ghastly corse From Vultures of the deep then wherefore shouldst thou rage Against me who thee guarded in the night of death from harm Tharmas replied. Art thou Urthona My friend my old companion, With whom I livd in happiness before that deadly night When Urizen gave the horses of Light into the hands of Luvah Thou knowest not what Tharmas knows. O I could tell thee tales That would enrage thee as it has Enraged me even From Death in wrath &amp; fury. But now come bear back Thy loved Enitharmon. For thou hast her here before thine Eyes But my sweet Enion is vanishd &amp; I never more Shall see her unless thou O Shadow. wilt protect this Son Of Enion &amp; him assist. to bind the fallen King Lest he should rise again from death in all his dreary power Bind him, take Enitharmon for thy sweet reward while I In vain am driven on false hope. hope sister of despair Groaning the terror rose &amp; drave his solid rocks before Upon the tide till underneath the feet of Los a World Dark dreadful rose &amp; Enitharmon lay at Los's feet The dolorous shadow joyd. weak hope appeard around his head Tharmas before Los stood &amp; thus the Voice of Tharmas rolld Now all comes into the power of Tharmas. Urizen is falln And Luvah hidden in the Elemental forms of Life &amp; Death Urthona is My Son O Los thou art Urthona &amp; Tharmas Is God. The Eternal Man is seald never to be deliverd I roll my floods over his body my billows &amp; waves pass over him The Sea encompasses him &amp; monsters of the deep are his companions Dreamer of furious oceans cold sleeper of weeds &amp; shells Thy Eternal form shall never renew my uncertain prevails against thee Yet tho I rage God over all. A portion of my Life That in Eternal fields in comfort wanderd with my flocks At noon &amp; laid her head upon my wearied bosom at night She is divided She is vanishd even like Luvah &amp; Vala O why did foul ambition sieze thee Urizen Prince of Light And thee O Luvah prince of Love till Tharmas was divided And I what can I now behold but an Eternal Death Before my Eyes &amp; an Eternal weary work to strive Against the monstrous forms that breed among my silent waves Is this to be A God far rather would I be a Man To know sweet Science &amp; to do with simple companions Sitting beneath a tent &amp; viewing sheepfolds &amp; soft pastures Take thou the hammer of Urthona rebuild these furnaces Dost thou refuse mind I the sparks that issue from thy hair I will compell thee to rebuild by these my furious waves Death choose or life thou strugglest in my waters, now choose life And all the Elements shall serve thee to their soothing flutes Their sweet inspiriting lyres thy labours shall administer And they to thee only remit not faint not thou my son Now thou dost know what tis to strive against the God of waters So saying Tharmas on his furious chariots of the Deep Departed far into the Unknown &amp; left a wondrous void Round Los. afar his waters bore on all sides round. with noise Of wheels &amp; horses hoofs &amp; Trumpets Horns &amp; Clarions Terrified Los beheld the ruins of Urizen beneath A horrible Chaos to his eyes. a formless unmeasurable Death Whirling up broken rocks on high into the dismal air And fluctuating all beneath in Eddies of molten fluid Then Los with terrible hands siezd on the Ruind Furnaces Of Urizen. Enormous work: he builded them anew Labour of Ages in the Darkness &amp; the war of Tharmas And Los formd Anvils of Iron petrific. for his blows Petrify with incessant beating many a rock. many a planet But Urizen slept in a stoned stupor in the nether Abyss A dreamful horrible State in tossings on his icy bed Freezing to solid all beneath, his grey oblivious form Stretchd over the immense heaves in strong shudders. silent his voice In brooding contemplation stretching out from North to South In mighty power. Round him Los rolld furious His thunderous wheels from furnace to furnace. tending diligent The contemplative terror. frightend in his scornful sphere Frightend with cold infectious madness. in his hand the thundering Hammer of Urthona. forming under his heavy hand the hours The days &amp; years. in chains of iron round the limbs of Urizen Linkd hour to hour &amp; day to night &amp; night to day &amp; year to year In periods of pulsative furor. mills he formd &amp; works Of many wheels resistless in the power of dark Urthona But Enitharmon wrapd in clouds waild loud. for as Los beat The anvils of Urthona link by link the chains of sorrow Warping upon the winds &amp; whirling round in the dark deep Lashd on the limbs of Enitharmon &amp; the sulphur fires Belchd from the furnaces wreathd round her. chaind in ceaseless fire The lovely female howld &amp; Urizen beneath deep groand Deadly between the hammers beating grateful to the Ears Of Los. absorbd in dire revenge he drank with joy the cries Of Enitharmon &amp; the groans of Urizen fuel for his wrath And for his pity secret feeding on thoughts of cruelty The Spectre wept at his dire labours when from Ladles huge He pourd the molten iron round the limbs of Enitharmon But when he pourd it round the bones of Urizen he laughd Hollow upon the hollow wind. his shadowy form obeying The voice of Los compelld he labourd round the Furnaces And thus began the binding of Urizen day &amp; night in fear Circling round the dark Demon with howlings dismay &amp; sharp blightings The Prophet of Eternity beat on his iron links &amp; links of brass And as he beat round the hurtling Demon. terrified at the Shapes Enslavd humanity put on he became what he beheld Raging against Tharmas his God &amp; uttering Ambiguous words blasphemous filld with envy firm resolvd On hate Eternal in his vast disdain he labourd beating The Links of fate link after link an endless chain of sorrows The Eternal Mind bounded began to roll eddies of wrath ceaseless Round &amp; round &amp; the sulphureous foam surgeing thick Settled a Lake bright &amp; shining clear. White as the snow Forgetfulness dumbness necessity in chains of the mind lockd up In fetters of ice shrinking. disorganizd rent from Eternity Los beat on his fetters &amp; heated his furnaces And pourd iron sodor &amp; sodor of brass Restless the immortal inchaind heaving dolorous Anguished unbearable till a roof shaggy wild inclosd In an orb his fountain of thought In a horrible dreamful slumber like the linked chain A vast spine writhd in torment upon the wind Shooting paind. ribbs like a bending Cavern And bones of solidness froze over all his nerves of joy A first age passed. a state of dismal woe From the Caverns of his jointed spine down sunk with fright A red round globe. hot burning. deep deep down into the Abyss Panting Conglobing trembling Shooting out ten thousand branches Around his solid bones &amp; a Second Age passed over In harrowing fear rolling his nervous brain shot branches On high into two little orbs hiding in two little caves Hiding carefully from the wind his eyes beheld the deep And a third age passed a State of dismal woe The pangs of hope began in heavy pain striving struggling Two Ears in close volutions from beneath his orbs of vision Shot spiring out &amp; petrified as they grew. And a Fourth Age passed over &amp; a State of dismal woe In ghastly torment sick hanging upon the wind Two nostrils bent down to the deeps— And a fifth age passed &amp; a state of dismal woe In ghastly torment sick. within his ribs bloated round A craving hungry cavern. Thence arose his channeld Throat. then like a red flame a tongue of hunger And thirst appeard and a sixth age passed of dismal woe Enraged &amp; stifled with torment he threw his right arm to the north His left arm to the south shooting out in anguish deep And his feet stampd the nether abyss in trembling howling &amp; dismay And a seventh age passed over &amp; a state of dismal woe The Council of God on high watching over the Body Of Man clothd in Luvahs robes of blood saw &amp; wept Descending over Beulahs mild moon coverd regions The daughters of Beulah saw the Divine Vision they were comforted And as a Double female form loveliness &amp; perfection of beauty They bowd the head &amp; worshippd &amp; with mild voice spoke these words Lord. Saviour if thou hadst been here our brother had not died And now we know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God He will give it thee for we are weak women &amp; dare not lift Our eyes to the Divine pavilions. therefore in mercy thou Appearest clothd in Luvahs garments that we may behold thee And live. Behold Eternal Death is in Beulah Behold We perish &amp; shall not be found unless thou grant a place In which we may be hidden under the Shadow of wings For if we who are but for a time &amp; who pass away in winter Behold these wonders of Eternity we shall consume Such were the words of Beulah of the Feminine Emanation The Empyrean groand throughout All Eden was darkend The Corse of Albion lay on the Rock the sea of Time &amp; Space Beat round the Rock in mighty waves &amp; as a Polypus That vegetates beneath the Sea the limbs of Man vegetated In monstrous forms of Death a Human polypus of Death The Saviour mild &amp; gentle bent over the corse of Death Saying If ye will Believe your Brother shall rise again And first he found the Limit of Opacity &amp; namd it Satan In Albions bosom for in every human bosom these limits stand And next he found the Limit of Contraction &amp; namd it Adam While yet those beings were not born nor knew of good or Evil Then wondrously the Starry Wheels felt the divine hand. Limit Was put to Eternal Death Los felt the Limit &amp; saw The Finger of God touch the Seventh furnace in terror And Los beheld the hand of God over his furnaces Beneath the Deeps in dismal Darkness beneath immensity In terrors Los shrunk from his task. his great hammer Fell from his hand his fires hid their strong limbs in smoke For with noises ruinous hurtlings &amp; clashings &amp; groans The immortal endur'd. tho bound in a deadly sleep Pale terror siezd the Eyes of Los as he beat round The hurtling Demon. terrifid at the shapes Enslavd humanity put on he became what he beheld He became what he was doing he was himself transformd Bring in here the Globe of Blood as in the B of Urizen Spasms siezd his muscular fibres writhing to &amp; fro his pallid lips Unwilling movd as Urizen howld his loins wavd like the sea At Enitharmons shriek his knees each other smote &amp; then he lookd With stony Eyes on Urizen &amp; then swift writhd his neck Involuntary to the Couch where Enitharmon lay The bones of Urizen hurtle on the wind the bones of Los Twinge &amp; his iron sinews bend like lead &amp; fold Into unusual forms dancing &amp; howling stamping the Abyss End of the Fourth Night Vala Night The Fifth Infected Mad he dancd on his mountains high &amp; dark as heaven Now fixd into one stedfast bulk his features stonify From his mouth curses &amp; from his eyes sparks of blighting Beside the anvil cold he dancd with the hammer of Urthona Terrific pale. Enitharmon stretchd on the dreary Earth Felt her immortal limbs freeze stiffning pale inflexible His feet shr[u]nk withring from the deep shrinking &amp; withering And Enitharmon shrunk up all their fibres withring beneath As plants witherd by winter leaves &amp; stems &amp; roots decaying Melt into thin air while the seed drivn by the furious wind Rests on the distant Mountains top. So Los &amp; Enitharmon Shrunk into fixed space stood trembling on a Rocky cliff Yet mighty bulk &amp; majesty &amp; beauty remaind but unexpansive As far as highest Zenith from the lowest Nadir. so far shrunk Los from the furnaces a Space immense &amp; left the cold Prince of Light bound in chains of intellect among the furnaces But all the furnaces were out &amp; the bellows had ceast to blow He stood trembling &amp; Enitharmon clung around his knees Their senses unexpansive in one stedfast bulk remain The night blew cold &amp; Enitharmon shriekd on the dismal wind Her pale hands cling around her husband &amp; over her weak head Shadows of Eternal Death sit in the leaden air But the soft pipe the flute the viol organ harp &amp; cymbal And the sweet sound of silver voices calm the weary couch Of Enitharmon but her groans drown the immortal harps Loud &amp; more loud the living music floats upon the air Faint &amp; more faint the daylight wanes. The wheels of turning darkness Began in solemn revolutions. Earth convulsd with rending pangs Rockd to &amp; fro &amp; cried sore at the groans of Enitharmon Still the faint harps &amp; silver voices calm the weary couch But from the caves of deepest night ascending in clouds of mist The winter spread his wide black wings across from pole to pole Grim frost beneath &amp; terrible snow linkd in a marriage chain Began a dismal dance. The winds around on pointed rocks Settled like bats innumerable ready to fly abroad The groans of Enitharmon shake the skies the labring Earth Till from her heart rending his way a terrible Child sprang forth In thunder smoke &amp; sullen flames &amp; howlings &amp; fury &amp; blood Soon as his burning Eyes were opend on the Abyss The horrid trumpets of the deep bellowd with bitter blasts The Enormous Demons woke &amp; howld around the new born king Crying Luvah King of Love thou art the King of rage &amp; death Urizen cast deep darkness round him raging Luvah pourd The spears of Urizen from Chariots round the Eternal tent Discord began then yells &amp; cries shook the wide firma[m]ent Where is Sweet Vala gloomy prophet where the lovely form That drew the body of Man from heaven into this dark Abyss Soft tears &amp; sighs where are you come forth shout on bloody fields Shew thy soul Vala shew thy bow &amp; quiver of secret fires Draw thy bow Vala from the depths of hell thy black bow draw And twang the bow string to our howlings let thine arrows black Sing in the Sky as once they sang upon the hills of Light When dark Urthona wept in torment of the secret pain He wept &amp; he divided &amp; he laid his gloomy head Down on the Rock of Eternity on darkness of the deep Torn by black storms &amp; ceaseless torrents of consuming fire Within his breast his fiery sons chaind down &amp; filld with cursings And breathing terrible blood &amp; vengeance gnashing his teeth with pain Let loose the Enormous Spirit in the darkness of the deep And his dark wife that once fair crystal form divinely clear Within his ribs producing serpents whose souls are flames of fire But now the times return upon thee Enitharmons womb Now holds thee soon to issue forth. Sound Clarions of war Call Vala from her close recess in all her dark deceit Then rage on rage shall fierce redound out of her crystal quiver So sung the Demons round red Orc &amp; round faint Enitharmon Sweat &amp; blood stood on the limbs of Los in globes. his fiery Eyelids Faded. he rouzd he siezd the wonder in his hands &amp; went Shuddring &amp; weeping thro the Gloom &amp; down into the deeps Enitharmon nursd her fiery child in the dark deeps Sitting in darkness. over her Los mournd in anguish fierce Coverd with gloom. the fiery boy grew fed by the milk Of Enitharmon. Los around her builded pillars of iron And brass &amp; silver &amp; gold fourfold in dark prophetic fear For now he feard Eternal Death &amp; uttermost Extinction He builded Golgonooza on the Lake of Udan Adan Upon the Limit of Translucence then he builded Luban Tharmas laid the Foundations &amp; Los finishd it in howling woe But when fourteen summers &amp; winters had revolved over Their solemn habitation Los beheld the ruddy boy Embracing his bright mother &amp; beheld malignant fires In his young eyes discerning plain that Orc plotted his death Grief rose upon his ruddy brows. a tightening girdle grew Around his bosom like a bloody cord. in secret sobs He burst it, but next morn another girdle succeeds Around his bosom. Every day he viewd the fiery youth With silent fear &amp; his immortal cheeks grew deadly pale Till many a morn &amp; many a night passd over in dire woe Forming a girdle in the day &amp; bursting it at night The girdle was formd by day by night was burst in twain Falling down on the rock an iron chain link by link lockd Enitharmon beheld the bloody chain of nights &amp; days Depending from the bosom of Los &amp; how with griding pain He went each morning to his labours with the spectre dark Calld it the chain of Jealousy. Now Los began to speak His woes aloud to Enitharmon. since he could not hide His uncouth plague. He siezd the boy in his immortal hands While Enitharmon followd him weeping in dismal woe Up to the iron mountains top &amp; there the Jealous chain Fell from his bosom on the mountain. The Spectre dark Held the fierce boy Los naild him down binding around his limbs The accursed chain O how bright Enitharmon howld &amp; cried Over her son. Obdurate Los bound down her loved Joy The hammer of Urthona smote the rivets in terror. of brass Tenfold. the Demons rage flamd tenfold forth rending Roaring redounding. Loud Loud Louder &amp; Louder &amp; fird The darkness warring with the waves of Tharmas &amp; Snows of Urizen Crackling the flames went up with fury from the immortal demon Surrounded with flames the Demon grew loud howling in his fires Los folded Enitharmon in a cold white cloud in fear Then led her down into the deeps &amp; into his labyrinth Giving the Spectre sternest charge over the howling fiend Concenterd into Love of Parent Storgous Appetite Craving His limbs bound down mock at his chains for over them a flame Of circling fire unceasing plays to feed them with life &amp; bring The virtues of the Eternal worlds ten thousand thousand spirits Of life lament around the Demon going forth &amp; returning At his enormous call they flee into the heavens of heavens And back return with wine &amp; food. Or dive into the deeps To bring the thrilling joys of sense to quell his ceaseless rage His eyes the lights of his large soul contract or else expand Contracted they behold the secrets of the infinite mountains The veins of gold &amp; silver &amp; the hidden things of Vala Whatever grows from its pure bud or breathes a fragrant soul Expanded they behold the terrors of the Sun &amp; Moon The Elemental Planets &amp; the orbs of eccentric fire His nostrils breathe a fiery flame. his locks are like the forests Of wild beasts there the lion glares the tyger &amp; wolf howl there And there the Eagle hides her young in cliffs &amp; precipices His bosom is like starry heaven expanded all the stars Sing round. there waves the harvest &amp; the vintage rejoices. the Springs Flow into rivers of delight. there the spontaneous flowers Drink laugh &amp; sing. the grasshopper the Emmet &amp; the Fly The golden Moth builds there a house &amp; spreads her silken bed His loins inwove with silken fires are like a furnace fierce As the strong Bull in summer time when bees sing round the heath Where the herds low after the shadow &amp; after the water spring The numrous flocks cover the mountain &amp; shine along the valley His knees are rocks of adamant &amp; rubie &amp; emerald Spirits of strength in Palaces rejoice in golden armour Armed with spear &amp; shield they drink &amp; rejoice over the slain Such is the Demon such his terror in the nether deep But when returnd to Golgonooza Los &amp; Enitharmon Felt all the sorrow Parents feel. they wept toward one another And Los repented that he had chaind Orc upon the mountain And Enitharmons tears prevaild parental love returnd Tho terrible his dread of that infernal chain They rose At midnight hasting to their much beloved care Nine days they traveld thro the Gloom of Entuthon Benithon Los taking Enitharmon by the hand led her along The dismal vales &amp; up to the iron mountains top where Orc Howld in the furious wind he thought to give to Enitharmon Her son in tenfold joy &amp; to compensate for her tears Even if his own death resulted so much pity him paind But when they came to the dark rock &amp; to the spectrous cave Lo the young limbs had strucken root into the rock &amp; strong Fibres had from the Chain of Jealousy inwove themselves In a swift vegetation round the rock &amp; round the Cave And over the immortal limbs of the terrible fiery boy In vain they strove now to unchain. In vain with bitter tears To melt the chain of Jealousy. not Enitharmons death Nor the Consummation of Los could ever melt the chain Nor unroot the infernal fibres from their rocky bed Nor all Urthonas strength nor all the power of Luvahs Bulls Tho they each morning drag the unwilling Sun out of the deep Could uproot the infernal chain. for it had taken root Into the iron rock &amp; grew a chain beneath the Earth Even to the Center wrapping round the Center &amp; the limbs Of Orc entering with fibres. became one with him a living Chain Sustained by the Demons life. Despair &amp; Terror &amp; Woe &amp; Rage Inwrap the Parents in cold clouds as they bend howling over The terrible boy till fainting by his side the Parents fell Not long they lay Urthonas spectre found herbs of the pit Rubbing their temples he reviv'd them. all their lamentations I write not here but all their after life was lamentation When satiated with grief they returnd back to Golgonooza Enitharmon on the road of Dranthon felt the inmost gate Of her bright heart burst open &amp; again close with a deadly pain Within her heart Vala began to reanimate in bursting sobs And when the Gate was open she beheld that dreary Deep Where bright Ahania wept. She also saw the infernal roots Of the chain of Jealousy &amp; felt the rendings of fierce howling Orc Rending the Caverns like a mighty wind pent in the Earth Tho wide apart as furthest north is from the furthest south Urizen trembled where he lay to hear the howling terror The rocks shook the Eternal bars tuggd to &amp; fro were rifted Outstretchd upon the stones of ice the ruins of his throne Urizen shuddring heard his trembling limbs shook the strong caves The Woes of Urizen shut up in the deep dens of Urthona Ah how shall Urizen the King submit to this dark mansion Ah how is this! Once on the heights I stretchd my throne sublime The mountains of Urizen once of silver where the sons of wisdom dwelt And on whose tops the Virgins sang are rocks of Desolation My fountains once the haunt of Swans now breed the scaly tortoise The houses of my harpers are become a haunt of crows The gardens of wisdom are become a field of horrid graves And on the bones I drop my tears &amp; water them in vain Once how I walked from my palace in gardens of delight The sons of wisdom stood around the harpers followd with harps Nine virgins clothd in light composd the song to their immortal voices And at my banquets of new wine my head was crownd with joy Then in my ivory pavilions I slumberd in the noon And walked in the silent night among sweet smelling flowers Till on my silver bed I slept &amp; sweet dreams round me hoverd But now my land is darkend &amp; my wise men are departed My songs are turned to cries of Lamentation Heard on my Mountains &amp; deep sighs under my palace roofs Because the Steeds of Urizen once swifter than the light Were kept back from my Lord &amp; from his chariot of mercies O did I keep the horses of the day in silver pastures O I refusd the Lord of day the horses of his prince O did I close my treasuries with roofs of solid stone And darken all my Palace walls with envyings &amp; hate O Fool to think that I could hide from his all piercing eyes The gold &amp; silver &amp; costly stones his holy workmanship O Fool could I forget the light that filled my bright spheres Was a reflection of his face who calld me from the deep I well remember for I heard the mild &amp; holy voice Saying O light spring up &amp; shine &amp; I sprang up from the deep He gave to me a silver scepter &amp; crownd me with a golden crown &amp; said Go forth &amp; guide my Son who wanders on the ocean I went not forth. I hid myself in black clouds of my wrath I calld the stars around my feet in the night of councils dark The stars threw down their spears &amp; fled naked away We fell. I siezd thee dark Urthona In my left hand falling I siezd thee beauteous Luvah thou art faded like a flower And like a lilly is thy wife Vala witherd by winds When thou didst bear the golden cup at the immortal tables Thy children smote their fiery wings crownd with the gold of heaven Thy pure feet stepd on the steps divine. too pure for other feet And thy fair locks shadowd thine eyes from the divine effulgence Then thou didst keep with Strong Urthona the living gates of heaven But now thou art bound down with him even to the gates of hell Because thou gavest Urizen the wine of the Almighty For steeds of Light that they might run in thy golden chariot of pride I gave to thee the Steeds I pourd the stolen wine And drunken with the immortal draught fell from my throne sublime I will arise Explore these dens &amp; find that deep pulsation That shakes my caverns with strong shudders. perhaps this is the night Of Prophecy &amp; Luvah hath burst his way from Enitharmon When Thought is closd in Caves. Then love shall shew its root in deepest Hell End of the Fifth Night Vala Night the Sixth So Urizen arose &amp; leaning on his Spear explord his dens He threw his flight thro the dark air to where a river flowd And taking off his silver helmet filled it &amp; drank But when unsatiated his thirst he assayd to gather more Lo three terrific women at the verge of the bright flood Who would not suffer him to approach. but drove him back with storms Urizen knew them not &amp; thus addressd the spirits of darkness Who art thou Eldest Woman sitting in thy clouds What is that name written on thy forehead? what art thou? And wherefore dost thou pour this water forth in sighs &amp; care She answerd not but filld her urn &amp; pourd it forth abroad Answerest thou not said Urizen. then thou maist answer me Thou terrible woman clad in blue, whose strong attractive power Draws all into a fountain at the rock of thy attraction With frowning brow thou sittest mistress of these mighty waters She answerd not but stretchd her arms &amp; threw her limbs abroad Or wilt thou answer youngest Woman clad in shining green With labour &amp; care thou dost divide the current into four Queen of these dreadful rivers speak &amp; let me hear thy voice They reard up a wall of rocks and Urizen raisd his spear. They gave a scream, they knew their father Urizen knew his daughters They shrunk into their channels. dry the rocky strand beneath his feet Hiding themselves in rocky forms from the Eyes of Urizen Then Urizen wept &amp; thus his lamentation poured forth O horrible O dreadful state! those whom I loved best On whom I pourd the beauties of my light adorning them With jewels &amp; precious ornament labourd with art divine Vests of the radiant colours of heaven &amp; crowns of golden fire I gave sweet lillies to their breasts &amp; roses to their hair I taught them songs of sweet delight. I gave their tender voices Into the blue expanse &amp; I invented with laborious art Sweet instruments of sound. in pride encompassing my Knees They pourd their radiance above all. the daughters of Luvah Envied At their exceeding brightness &amp; the sons of eternity sent them gifts Now will I pour my fury on them &amp; I will reverse The precious benediction. for their colours of loveliness I will give blackness for jewels hoary frost for ornament deformity For crowns wreathd Serpents for sweet odors stinking corruptibility For voices of delight hoarse croakings inarticulate thro frost For labourd fatherly care &amp; sweet instruction. I will give Chains of dark ignorance &amp; cords of twisted self conceit And whips of stern repentance &amp; food of stubborn obstinacy That they may curse Tharmas their God &amp; Los his adopted son That they may curse &amp; worship the obscure Demon of destruction That they may worship terrors &amp; obey the violent Go forth sons of my curse Go forth daughters of my abhorrence Tharmas heard the deadly scream across his watry world And Urizens loud sounding voice lamenting on the wind And he came riding in his fury. froze to solid were his waves Silent in ridges he beheld them stand round Urizen A dreary waste of solid waters for the King of Light Darkend his brows with his cold helmet &amp; his gloomy spear Darkend before him. Silent on the ridgy waves he took His gloomy way before him Tharmas fled &amp; flying fought Crying. What &amp; who art thou Cold Demon. art thou Urizen Art thou like me risen again from death or art thou deathless If thou art he my desperate purpose hear &amp; give me death For death to me is better far than life. death my desire That I in vain in various paths have sought but still I live The Body of Man is given to me I seek in vain to destroy For still it surges forth in fish &amp; monsters of the deeps And in these monstrous forms I Live in an Eternal woe And thou O Urizen art falln never to be deliverd Withhold thy light from me for ever &amp; I will withhold From thee thy food so shall we cease to be &amp; all our sorrows End &amp; the Eternal Man no more renew beneath our power If thou refusest in eternal flight thy beams in vain Shall pursue Tharmas &amp; in vain shalt crave for food I will Pour down my flight thro dark immensity Eternal falling Thou shalt pursue me but in vain till starvd upon the void Thou hangst a dried skin shrunk up weak wailing in the wind So Tharmas spoke but Urizen replied not. On his way He took. high bounding over hills &amp; desarts floods &amp; horrible chasms Infinite was his labour without end his travel he strove In vain for hideous monsters of the deeps annoyd him sore Scaled &amp; finnd with iron &amp; brass they devourd the path before him Incessant was the conflict. On he bent his weary steps Making a path toward the dark world of Urthona. he rose With pain upon the dreary mountains &amp; with pain descended And saw their grizly fears &amp; his eyes sickend at the sight The howlings gnashings groanings shriekings shudderings sobbings burstings Mingle together to create a world for Los. In cruel delight Los brooded on the darkness. nor saw Urizen with a Globe of fire Lighting his dismal journey thro the pathless world of death Writing in bitter tears &amp; groans in books of iron &amp; brass The enormous wonders of the Abysses once his brightest joy For Urizen beheld the terrors of the Abyss wandring among The ruind spirits once his children &amp; the children of Luvah Scard at the sound of their own sigh that seems to shake the immense They wander Moping in their heart a Sun a Dreary moon A Universe of fiery constellations in their brain An Earth of wintry woe beneath their feet &amp; round their loins Waters or winds or clouds or brooding lightnings &amp; pestilential plagues Beyond the bounds of their own self their senses cannot penetrate As the tree knows not what is outside of its leaves &amp; bark And yet it drinks the summer joy &amp; fears the winter sorrow So in the regions of the grave none knows his dark compeer Tho he partakes of his dire woes &amp; mutual returns the pang The throb the dolor the convulsion in soul sickening woes The horrid shapes &amp; sights of torment in burning dungeons &amp; in Fetters of red hot iron some with crowns of serpents &amp; some With monsters girding round their bosoms. Some lying on beds of sulphur On racks &amp; wheels he beheld women marching oer burning wastes Of Sand in bands of hundreds &amp; of fifties &amp; of thousands strucken with Lightnings which blazed after them upon their shoulders in their march In successive vollies with loud thunders swift flew the King of Light Over the burning desarts Then the desarts passd. involvd in clouds Of smoke with myriads moping in the stifling vapours. Swift Flew the King tho flagd his powers labring. till over rocks And Mountains faint weary he wanderd. where multitudes were shut Up in the solid mountains &amp; in rocks which heaved with their torments Then came he among fiery cities &amp; castles built of burning steel Then he beheld the forms of tygers &amp; of Lions dishumanizd men Many in serpents &amp; in worms stretchd out enormous length Over the sullen mould &amp; slimy tracks obstruct his way Drawn out from deep to deep woven by ribbd And scaled monsters or armd in iron shell or shell of brass Or gold a glittering torment shining &amp; hissing in eternal pain Some [as] columns of fire or of water sometimes stretchd out in heighth Sometimes in length sometimes englobing wandering in vain seeking for ease His voice to them was but an inarticulate thunder for their Ears Were heavy &amp; dull &amp; their eyes &amp; nostrils closed up Oft he stood by a howling victim Questioning in words Soothing or Furious no one answerd every one wrapd up In his own sorrow howld regardless of his words, nor voice Of sweet response could he obtain tho oft assayd with tears He knew they were his Children ruind in his ruind world Oft would he stand &amp; question a fierce scorpion glowing with gold In vain the terror heard not. then a lion he would Sieze By the fierce mane staying his howling course in vain the voice Of Urizen in vain the Eloquent tongue. A Rock a Cloud a Mountain Were now not Vocal as in Climes of happy Eternity Where the lamb replies to the infant voice &amp; the lion to the man of years Giving them sweet instructions Where the Cloud the River &amp; the Field Talk with the husbandman &amp; shepherd. But these attackd him sore Siezing upon his feet &amp; rending the Sinews that in Caves He hid to recure his obstructed powers with rest &amp; oblivion Here he had time enough to repent of his rashly threatend curse He saw them cursd beyond his Curse his soul melted with fear He could not take their fetters off for they grew from the soul Nor could he quench the fires for they flamd out from the heart Nor could he calm the Elements because himself was Subject So he threw his flight in terror &amp; pain &amp; in repentant tears When he had passd these southern terrors he approachd the East Void pathless beaten with iron sleet &amp; eternal hail &amp; rain No form was there no living thing &amp; yet his way lay thro This dismal world. he stood a while &amp; lookd back oer his former Terrific voyage. Hills &amp; Vales of torment &amp; despair Sighing &amp; wiping a fresh tear. then turning round he threw Himself into the dismal void. falling he fell &amp; fell Whirling in unresistible revolutions down &amp; down In the horrid bottomless vacuity falling falling falling Into the Eastern vacuity the empty world of Luvah The ever pitying one who seeth all things saw his fall And in the dark vacuity created a bosom of clay When wearied dead he fell his limbs reposd in the bosom of slime As the seed falls from the sowers hand so Urizen fell &amp; death Shut up his powers in oblivion. then as the seed shoots forth In pain &amp; sorrow. So the slimy bed his limbs renewd At first an infant weakness. periods passd he gatherd strength But still in solitude he sat then rising threw his flight Onward tho falling thro the waste of night &amp; ending in death And in another resurrection to sorrow &amp; weary travel But still his books he bore in his strong hands &amp; his iron pen For when he died they lay beside his grave &amp; when he rose He siezd them with a gloomy smile for wrapd in his death clothes He hid them when he slept in death when he revivd the clothes Were rotted by the winds the books remaind still unconsumd Still to be written &amp; interleavd with brass &amp; iron &amp; gold Time after time for such a journey none but iron pens Can write And adamantine leaves recieve nor can the man who goes The journey obstinate refuse to write time after time Endless had been his travel but the Divine hand him led For infinite the distance &amp; obscurd by Combustions dire By rocky masses frowning in the abysses revolving erratic Round Lakes of fire in the dark deep the ruins of Urizens world Oft would he sit in a dark rift &amp; regulate his books Or sleep such sleep as spirits eternal wearied in his dark Tearful &amp; sorrowful state. then rise look out &amp; ponder His dismal voyage eyeing the next sphere tho far remote Then darting into the Abyss of night his venturous limbs Thro lightnings thunders earthquakes &amp; concussions fires &amp; floods Stemming his downward fall labouring up against futurity Creating many a Vortex fixing many a Science in the deep And thence throwing his venturous limbs into the Vast unknown Swift Swift from Chaos to chaos from void to void a road immense For when he came to where a Vortex ceasd to operate Nor down nor up remaind then if he turnd &amp; lookd back From whence he came twas upward all. &amp; if he turnd and viewd The unpassd void upward was still his mighty wandring The midst between an Equilibrium grey of air serene Where he might live in peace &amp; where his life might meet repose But Urizen said Can I not leave this world of Cumbrous wheels Circle oer Circle nor on high attain a void Where self sustaining I may view all things beneath my feet Or sinking thro these Elemental wonders swift to fall I thought perhaps to find an End a world beneath of voidness Whence I might travel round the outside of this Dark confusion When I bend downward bending my head downward into the deep Tis upward all which way soever I my course begin But when A Vortex formd on high by labour &amp; sorrow &amp; care And weariness begins on all my limbs then sleep revives My wearied spirits waking then tis downward all which way So ever I my spirits turn no end I find of all O what a world is here unlike those climes of bliss Where my sons gatherd round my knees O thou poor ruind world Thou horrible ruin once like me thou wast all glorious And now like me partaking desolate thy masters lot Art thou O ruin the once glorious heaven are these thy rocks Where joy sang in the trees &amp; pleasure sported on the rivers And laughter sat beneath the Oaks &amp; innocence sported round Upon the green plains &amp; sweet friendship met in palaces And books &amp; instruments of song &amp; pictures of delight Where are they whelmd beneath these ruins in horrible destruction And if Eternal falling I repose on the dark bosom Of winds &amp; waters or thence fall into a Void where air Is not down falling thro immensity ever &amp; ever I lose my powers weakend every revolution till a death Shuts up my powers then a seed in the vast womb of darkness I dwell in dim oblivion. brooding over me the Enormous worlds Reorganize me shooting forth in bones &amp; flesh &amp; blood I am regenerated to fall or rise at will or to remain A labourer of ages a dire discontent a living woe Wandring in vain.

Seeking For Enions limbs nought finding but the black sea weed &amp; sickning slime Flying away from Urizen that he might not give him food Above beneath on all sides round in the vast deep of immensity That he might starve the sons &amp; daughters of Urizen on the winds Making between horrible chasms into the vast unknown All these around the world of Los cast forth their monstrous births But in Eternal times the Seat of Urizen is in the South Urthona in the North Luvah in East Tharmas in West And now he came into the Abhorred world of Dark Urthona By Providence divine conducted not bent from his own will Lest death Eternal should be the result for the Will cannot be violated Into the doleful vales where no tree grew nor river flowd Nor man nor beast nor creeping thing nor sun nor cloud nor star Still he with his globe of fire immense in his venturous hand Bore on thro the Affrighted vales ascending &amp; descending Oerwearied or in cumbrous flight he venturd oer dark rifts Or down dark precipices or climbd with pain and labour huge Till he beheld the world of Los from the Peaked rock of Urthona And heard the howling of red Orc distincter &amp; distincter Redoubling his immortal efforts thro the narrow vales With difficulty down descending guided by his Ear And by his globe of fire he went down the Vale of Urthona Between the enormous iron walls built by the Spectre dark Dark grew his globe reddning with mists &amp; full before his path Striding across the narrow vale the Shadow of Urthona A spectre Vast appeard whose feet &amp; legs with iron scaled Stampd the hard rocks expectant of the unknown wanderer Whom he had seen wandring his nether world when distant far And watchd his swift approach collected dark the Spectre stood Beside hi[m] Tharmas stayd his flight &amp; stood in stern defiance Communing with the Spectre who rejoicd along the vale Round his loins a girdle glowd with many colourd fires In his hand a knotted Club whose knots like mountains frownd Desart among the Stars them withering with its ridges cold Black scales of iron arm the dread visage iron spikes instead Of hair shoot from his orbed scull. his glowing eyes Burn like two furnaces. he calld with Voice of Thunder Four winged heralds mount the furious blasts &amp; blow their trumps Gold Silver Brass &amp; iron clangors clamoring rend the shores Like white clouds rising from the Vales his fifty two armies From the four Cliffs of Urthona rise glowing around the Spectre Four sons of Urizen the Squadrons of Urthona led in arms Of gold &amp; silver brass &amp; iron he knew his mighty sons Then Urizen arose upon the wind back many a mile Retiring into his dire Web scattering fleecy snows As he ascended howling loud the Web vibrated strong From heaven to heaven from globe to globe. In vast excentric paths Compulsive rolld the Comets at his dread command the dreary way Falling with wheel impetuous down among Urthonas vales And round red Orc returning back to Urizen gorgd with blood Slow roll the massy Globes at his command &amp; slow oerwheel The dismal squadrons of Urthona. weaving the dire Web In their progressions &amp; preparing Urizens path before him End of The Sixth Night Vala Night the Seventh [Written later than and presumably to replace Night Seven] Then Urizen arose The Spectre fled &amp; Tharmas fled The darkning Spectre of Urthona hid beneath a rock Tharmas threw his impetuous flight thro the deeps of immensity Revolving round in whirlpools fierce all round the cavernd worlds But Urizen silent descended to the Caves of Orc &amp; saw A Cavernd Universe of flaming fire the horses of Urizen Here bound to fiery mangers furious dash their golden hoofs Striking fierce sparkles from their brazen fetters. fierce his lions Howl in the burning dens his tygers roam in the redounding smoke In forests of affliction. the adamantine scales of justice Consuming in the raging lamps of mercy pourd in rivers The holy oil rages thro all the cavernd rocks fierce flames Dance on the rivers &amp; the rocks howling &amp; drunk with fury The plow of ages &amp; the golden harrow wade thro fields Of goary blood the immortal seed is nourishd for the slaughter The bulls of Luvah breathing fire bellow on burning pastures Round howling Orc whose awful limbs cast forth red smoke &amp; fire That Urizen approachd not near but took his seat on a rock And rangd his books around him brooding Envious over Orc Howling &amp; rending his dark caves the awful Demon lay Pulse after pulse beat on his fetters pulse after pulse his spirit Darted &amp; darted higher &amp; higher to the shrine of Enitharmon As when the thunder folds himself in thickest clouds The watry nations couch &amp; hide in the profoundest deeps Then bursting from his troubled head with terrible visages &amp; flaming hair His swift wingd daughters sweep across the vast black ocean Los felt the Envy in his limbs like to a blighted tree For Urizen fixd in Envy sat brooding &amp; coverd with snow His book of iron on his knees he tracd the dreadful letters While his snows fell &amp; his storms beat to cool the flames of Orc Age after Age till underneath his heel a deadly root Struck thro the rock the root of Mystery accursed shooting up Branches into the heaven of Los they pipe formd bending down Take root again whereever they touch again branching forth In intricate labyrinths oerspreading many a grizly deep Amazd started Urizen when he found himself compassd round And high roofed over with trees. he arose but the stems Stood so thick he with difficulty &amp; great pain brought His books out of the dismal shade. all but the book of iron Again he took his seat &amp; rangd his Books around On a rock of iron frowning over the foaming fires of Orc And Urizen hung over Orc &amp; viewd his terrible wrath Sitting upon an iron Crag at length his words broke forth Image of dread whence art thou whence is this most woful place Whence these fierce fires but from thyself No other living thing In all this Chasm I behold.

One dread morn Listen O vision of Delight One dread morn of goary blood The manhood was divided for the gentle passions making way Thro the infinite labyrinths of the heart &amp; thro the nostrils issuing In odorous stupefaction stood before the Eyes of Man A female bright.

While Enitharmon shriekd And trembled thro the Worlds above Los wept his fierce soul was terrifid At the shrieks of Enitharmon at her tossings nor could his eyes percieve The cause of her dire anguish for she lay the image of Death Movd by strong shudders till her shadow was deliverd then she ran Raving about the upper Elements in maddning fury She burst the Gates of Enitharmons heart with direful Crash Nor could they ever be closd again the golden hinges were broken And the gates broke in sunder &amp; their ornaments defacd Beneath the tree of Mystery for the immortal shadow shuddering Brought forth this wonder horrible a Cloud she grew &amp; grew Till many of the dead burst forth from the bottoms of their tombs In male forms without female counterparts or Emanations Cruel and ravening with Enmity &amp; Hatred &amp; War In dreams of Ulro dark delusive drawn by the lovely shadow The Spectre terrified gave her Charge over the howling Orc Then took the tree of Mystery root in the World of Los Its topmost boughs shooting a fibre beneath Enitharmons couch The double rooted Labyrinth soon wavd around their heads But then the Spectre enterd Los's bosom Every sigh &amp; groan Of Enitharmon bore Urthonas Spectre on its wings Obdurate Los felt Pity Enitharmon told the tale Of Urthona. Los embracd the Spectre first as a brother Then as another Self; astonishd humanizing &amp; in tears In Self abasement Giving up his Domineering lust Thou never canst embrace sweet Enitharmon terrible Demon. Till Thou art united with thy Spectre Consummating by pains &amp; labours That mortal body &amp; by Self annihilation back returning To Life Eternal be assurd I am thy real Self Tho thus divided from thee &amp; the Slave of Every passion Of thy fierce Soul Unbar the Gates of Memory look upon me Not as another but as thy real Self I am thy Spectre Tho horrible &amp; Ghastly to thine Eyes tho buried beneath The ruins of the Universe. hear what inspird I speak &amp; be silent Thou didst subdue me in old times by thy Immortal Strength When I was a ravning hungring &amp; thirsting cruel lust &amp; murder If we unite in one[,] another better world will be Opend within your heart &amp; loins &amp; wondrous brain Threefold as it was in Eternity &amp; this the fourth Universe Will be Renewd by the three &amp; consummated in Mental fires But if thou dost refuse Another body will be prepared For me &amp; thou annihilate evaporate &amp; be no more For thou art but a form &amp; organ of life &amp; of thyself Art nothing being Created Continually by Mercy &amp; Love divine Los furious answerd. Spectre horrible thy words astound my Ear With irresistible conviction I feel I am not one of those Who when convincd can still persist tho furious controllable By Reasons power. Even I already feel a World within Opening its gates &amp; in it all the real substances Of which these in the outward World are shadows which pass away Come then into my Bosom &amp; in thy shadowy arms bring with thee My lovely Enitharmon. I will quell my fury &amp; teach Peace to the Soul of dark revenge &amp; repentance to Cruelty So spoke Los &amp; Embracing Enitharmon &amp; the Spectre Clouds would have folded round in Extacy &amp; Love uniting But Enitharmon trembling fled &amp; hid beneath Urizens tree But mingling together with his Spectre the Spectre of Urthona Wondering beheld the Center opend by Divine Mercy inspired He in his turn Gave Tasks to Los Enormous to destroy That body he created but in vain for Los performd Wonders of labour They Builded Golgonooza Los labouring builded pillars high And Domes terrific in the nether heavens for beneath Was opend new heavens &amp; a new Earth beneath &amp; within Threefold within the brain within the heart within the loins A Threefold Atmosphere Sublime continuous from Urthonas world But yet having a Limit Twofold named Satan &amp; Adam But Los stood on the Limit of Translucence weeping &amp; trembling Filled with doubts in self accusation beheld the fruit Of Urizens Mysterious tree For Enitharmon thus spake When In the Deeps beneath I gatherd of this ruddy fruit It was by that I knew that I had Sinnd &amp; then I knew That without a ransom I could not be savd from Eternal death That Life lives upon Death &amp; by devouring appetite All things subsist on one another thenceforth in Despair I spend my glowing time but thou art strong &amp; mighty To bear this Self conviction take then Eat thou also of The fruit &amp; give me proof of life Eternal or I die Then Los plucked the fruit &amp; Eat &amp; sat down in Despair And must have given himself to death Eternal But Urthonas spectre in part mingling with him comforted him Being a medium between him &amp; Enitharmon But This Union Was not to be Effected without Cares &amp; Sorrows &amp; Troubles Of six thousand Years of self denial and of bitter Contrition Urthonas Spectre terrified beheld the Spectres of the Dead Each Male formd without a counterpart without a concentering vision The Spectre of Urthona wept before Los Saying I am the cause That this dire state commences I began the dreadful state Of Separation &amp; on my dark head the curse &amp; punishment Must fall unless a way be found to Ransom &amp; Redeem But I have thee my [Counterpart Vegetating] miraculous These Spectres have no [Counter(parts)] therefore they ravin Without the food of life Let us Create them Coun[terparts] For without a Created body the Spectre is Eternal Death Los trembling answerd Now I feel the weight of stern repentance Tremble not so my Enitharmon at the awful gates Of thy poor broken Heart I see thee like a shadow withering As on the outside of Existence but look! behold! take comfort! Turn inwardly thine Eyes &amp; there behold the Lamb of God Clothed in Luvahs robes of blood descending to redeem O Spectre of Urthona take comfort O Enitharmon Couldst thou but cease from terror &amp; trembling &amp; affright When I appear before thee in forgiveness of ancient injuries Why shouldst thou remember &amp; be afraid. I surely have died in pain Often enough to convince thy jealousy &amp; fear &amp; terror Come hither be patient let us converse together because I also tremble at myself &amp; at all my former life Enitharmon answerd I behold the Lamb of God descending To Meet these Spectres of the Dead I therefore fear that he Will give us to Eternal Death fit punishment for such Hideous offenders Uttermost extinction in eternal pain An ever dying life of stifling &amp; obstruction shut out Of existence to be a sign &amp; terror to all who behold Lest any should in futurity do as we have done in heaven Such is our state nor will the Son of God redeem us but destroy So Enitharmon spoke trembling &amp; in torrents of tears Los sat in Golgonooza in the Gate of Luban where He had erected many porches where branchd the Mysterious Tree Where the Spectrous dead wail &amp; sighing thus he spoke to Enitharmon Lovely delight of Men Enitharmon shady refuge from furious war Thy bosom translucent is a soft repose for the weeping souls Of those piteous victims of battle there they sleep in happy obscurity They feed upon our life we are their victims. Stern desire I feel to fabricate embodied semblances in which the dead May live before us in our palaces &amp; in our gardens of labour Which now opend within the Center we behold spread abroad To form a world of Sacrifice of brothers &amp; sons &amp; daughters To comfort Orc in his dire sufferings look my fires enlume afresh Before my face ascending with delight as in ancient times Enitharmon spread her beaming locks upon the wind &amp; said O Lovely terrible Los wonder of Eternity O Los my defence &amp; guide Thy works are all my joy. &amp; in thy fires my soul delights If mild they burn in just proportion &amp; in secret night And silence build their day in shadow of soft clouds &amp; dews Then I can sigh forth on the winds of Golgonooza piteous forms That vanish again into my bosom but if thou my Los Wilt in sweet moderated fury. fabricate forms sublime Such as the piteous spectres may assimilate themselves into They shall be ransoms for our Souls that we may live So Enitharmon spoke &amp; Los his hands divine inspired began To modulate his fires studious the loud roaring flames He vanquishd with the strength of Art bending their iron points And drawing them forth delighted upon the winds of Golgonooza From out the ranks of Urizens war &amp; from the fiery lake Of Orc binding down as the binder of the Sheaves follows The reaper in both arms embracing the furious raging flames Los drew them forth out of the deeps planting his right foot firm Upon the Iron crag of Urizen thence springing up aloft Into the heavens of Enitharmon in a mighty circle And first he drew a line upon the walls of shining heaven And Enitharmon tincturd it with beams of blushing love It remaind permanent a lovely form inspird divinely human Dividing into just proportions Los unwearied labourd The immortal lines upon the heavens till with sighs of love Sweet Enitharmon mild Entrancd breathd forth upon the wind The spectrous dead Weeping the Spectres viewd the immortal works Of Los Assimilating to those forms Embodied &amp; Lovely In youth &amp; beauty in the arms of Enitharmon mild reposing First Rintrah &amp; then Palamabron drawn from out the ranks of war In infant innocence reposd on Enitharmons bosom Orc was comforted in the deeps his soul revivd in them As the Eldest brother is the fathers image So Orc became As Los a father to his brethren &amp; he joyd in the dark lake Tho bound with chains of Jealousy &amp; in scales of iron &amp; brass But Los loved them &amp; refusd to Sacrifice their infant limbs And Enitharmons smiles &amp; tears prevaild over self protection They rather chose to meet Eternal death than to destroy The offspring of their Care &amp; Pity Urthonas spectre was comforted But Tharmas most rejoicd in hope of Enions return For he beheld new Female forms born forth upon the air Who wove soft silken veils of covering in sweet rapturd trance Mortal &amp; not as Enitharmon without a covering veil First his immortal spirit drew Urizen[s] Shadow away From out the ranks of war separating him in sunder Leaving his Spectrous form which could not be drawn away Then he divided Thiriel the Eldest of Urizens sons Urizen became Rintrah Thiriel became Palamabron Thus dividing the powers of Every Warrior Startled was Los he found his Enemy Urizen now In his hands. he wonderd that he felt love &amp; not hate His whole soul loved him he beheld him an infant Lovely breathd from Enitharmon he trembled within himself Vala Night the Eighth Then All in Great Eternity Met in the Council of God as one Man Even Jesus upon Gilead &amp; Hermon Upon the Limit of Contraction to create the fallen Man The Fallen Man stretchd like a Corse upon the oozy Rock Washd with the tides Pale overgrown with weeds That movd with horrible dreams hovring high over his head Two winged immortal shapes one standing at his feet Toward the East one standing at his head toward the west Their wings joind in the Zenith over head Such is a Vision of All Beulah hovring over the Sleeper The limit of Contraction now was fixd &amp; Man began To wake upon the Couch of Death he sneezed seven times A tear of blood dropped from either eye again he reposd In the saviours arms, in the arms of tender mercy &amp; loving kindness Then Los said I behold the Divine Vision thro the broken Gates Of thy poor broken heart astonishd melted into Compassion &amp; Love And Enitharmon said I see the Lamb of God upon Mount Zion Wondring with love &amp; Awe they felt the divine hand upon them For nothing could restrain the dead in Beulah from descending Unto Ulros night tempted by the Shadowy females sweet Delusive cruelty they descend away from the Daughters of Beulah And Enter Urizens temple Enitharmon pitying &amp; her heart Gates broken down. they descend thro the Gate of Pity The broken heart Gate of Enitharmon She sighs them forth upon the wind Of Golgonooza Los stood recieving them For Los could enter into Enitharmons bosom &amp; explore Its intricate Labyrinths now the Obdurate heart was broken From out the War of Urizen &amp; Tharmas recieving them Into his hands. Then Enitharmon erected Looms in Lubans Gate And calld the Looms Cathedron in these Looms She wove the Spectres Bodies of Vegetation Singing lulling Cadences to drive away Despair from the poor wandering spectres and Los loved them With a parental love for the Divine hand was upon him And upon Enitharmon &amp; the Divine Countenance shone In Golgonooza Looking down the Daughters of Beulah saw With joy the bright Light &amp; in it a Human form And knew he was the Saviour Even Jesus &amp; they worshipped Astonishd Comforted Delighted in notes of Rapturous Extacy All Beulah stood astonishd Looking down to Eternal Death They saw the Saviour beyond the Pit of death &amp; destruction For whether they lookd upward they saw the Divine Vision Or whether they lookd downward still they saw the Divine Vision Surrounding them on all sides beyond sin &amp; death &amp; hell Enitharmon wove in tears singing Songs of Lamentation And pitying comfort as she sighd forth on the wind the Spectres Also the Vegetated bodies which Enitharmon wove Opend within their hearts &amp; in their loins &amp; in their brain To Beulah &amp; the Dead in Ulro descended from the War Of Urizen &amp; Tharmas &amp; from the Shadowy females clouds And some were woven single &amp; some two fold &amp; some three fold In Head or Heart or Reins according to the fittest order Of most merciful pity &amp; compassion to the Spectrous dead When Urizen saw the Lamb of God clothed in Luvahs robes Perplexd &amp; terrifid he Stood tho well he knew that Orc Was Luvah But he now beheld a new Luvah. Or One Who assumd Luvahs form &amp; stood before him opposite But he saw Orc a Serpent form augmenting times on times In the fierce battle &amp; he saw the Lamb of God &amp; the World of Los Surrounded by his dark machines for Orc augmented swift In fury a Serpent wondrous among the Constellations of Urizen A crest of fire rose on his forehead red as the carbuncle Beneath down to his eyelids scales of pearl then gold &amp; silver Immingled with the ruby overspread his Visage down His furious neck writ[h]ing contortive in dire budding pains The scaly armour shot out. Stubborn down his back &amp; bosom The Emerald Onyx Sapphire jasper beryl amethyst Strove in terrific emulation which should gain a place Upon the mighty Fiend the fruit of the mysterious tree Kneaded in Uveths kneading trough. Still Orc devourd the food In raging hunger Still the pestilential food in gems &amp; gold Exuded round his awful limbs Stretching to serpent length His human bulk While the dark shadowy female brooding over Measurd his food morning &amp; evening in cups &amp; baskets of iron With tears of sorrow incessant she labourd the food of Orc Compelld by the iron hearted sisters Daughters of Urizen Gathring the fruit of that mysterious tree circling its root She spread herself thro all the branches in the power of Orc Thus Urizen in self deceit his warlike preparations fabricated And when all things were finishd sudden wavd among the Stars His hurtling hand gave the dire signal thunderous Clarions blow And all the hollow deep rebellowd with the wonderous war But Urizen his mighty rage let loose in the mid deep Sparkles of Dire affliction issud round his frozen limbs Horrible hooks &amp; nets he formd twisting the cords of iron And brass &amp; molten metals cast in hollow globes &amp; bor'd Tubes in petrific steel &amp; rammd combustibles &amp; wheels And chains &amp; pullies fabricated all round the heavens of Los Communing with the Serpent of Orc in dark dissimulation And with the Synagogue of Satan in dark Sanhedrim To undermine the World of Los &amp; tear bright Enitharmon To the four winds hopeless of future. All futurity Seems teeming with Endless destruction never to be repelld Desperate remorse swallows the present in a quenchless rage Terrified &amp; astonishd Urizen beheld the battle take a form Which he intended not a Shadowy hermaphrodite black &amp; opake The Soldiers namd it Satan but he was yet unformd &amp; vast Hermaphroditic it at length became hiding the Male Within as in a Tabernacle Abominable Deadly The battle howls the terrors fird rage in the work of death Enormous Works Los Contemplated inspird by the holy Spirit Los builds the Walls of Golgonooza against the stirring battle That only thro the Gates of Death they can enter to Enitharmon Raging they take the human visage &amp; the human form Feeling the hand of Los in Golgonooza &amp; the force Attractive of his hammers beating &amp; the Silver looms Of Enitharmon singing lulling cadences on the wind They humanize in the fierce battle where in direful pain Troop by troop the beastial droves rend one another sounding loud The instruments of sound &amp; troop by troop in human forms they urge The dire confusion till the battle faints those that remain Return in pangs &amp; horrible convulsions to their beastial state For the monsters of the Elements Lions or Tygers or Wolves Sound loud the howling music Inspird by Los &amp; Enitharmon Sounding loud terrific men They seem to one another laughing terrible among the banners And when the revolution of their day of battles over Relapsing in dire torment they return to forms of woe To moping visages returning inanimate tho furious No more erect tho strong drawn out in length they ravin For senseless gratification &amp; their visages thrust forth Flatten above &amp; beneath &amp; stretch out into beastial length Weakend they stretch beyond their power in dire droves till war begins Or Secret religion in their temples before secret shrines And Urizen gave life &amp; sense by his immortal power To all his Engines of deceit that linked chains might run Thro ranks of war spontaneous &amp; that hooks &amp; boring screws Might act according to their forms by innate cruelty He formed also harsh instruments of sound To grate the soul into destruction or to inflame with fury The spirits of life to pervert all the faculties of sense Into their own destruction if perhaps he might avert His own despair even at the cost of every thing that breathes Thus in the temple of the Sun his books of iron &amp; brass And silver &amp; gold he consecrated reading incessantly To myriads of perturbed spirits thro the universe They propagated the deadly words the Shadowy Female absorbing The enormous Sciences of Urizen ages after ages exploring The fell destruction. And she said O Urizen Prince of Light What words of Dread pierce my faint Ear what fal[l]ing snows around My feeble limbs infold my destind misery I alone dare the lash abide to sit beneath the blast Unhurt &amp; dare the inclement forehead of the King of Light From dark abysses of the times remote fated to be The sorrower of Eternity in love with tears Submiss I rear My Eyes to thy Pavilions hear my prayer for Luvahs Sake I see the murderer of my Luvah clothd in robes of blood He who assumd my Luvahs throne in times of Everlasting Where hast thou hid him whom I love in what remote Abyss Resides that God of my delight O might my eyes behold My Luvah then could I deliver all the sons of God From Bondage of these terrors &amp; with influences sweet As once in those eternal fields in brotherhood &amp; Love United we should live in bliss as those who sinned not The Eternal Man is seald by thee never to be deliverd We are all servants to thy will O King of Light relent Thy furious power be our father &amp; our loved King But if my Luvah is no more If thou hast smitten him And laid him in the Sepulcher Or if thou wilt revenge His murder on another Silent I bow with dread But happiness can never [come] to thee O King nor me For he was source of every joy that this mysterious tree Unfolds in Allegoric fruit. When shall the dead revive Can that which has existed cease or can love &amp; life Expire Urizen heard the Voice &amp; saw the Shadow. underneath His woven darkness &amp; in laws &amp; deceitful religions Beginning at the tree of Mystery circling its root She spread herself thro all the branches in the power of Orc A shapeless &amp; indefinite cloud in tears of sorrow incessant Steeping the Direful Web of Religion swagging heavy it fell From heaven to heavn thro all its meshes altering the Vortexes Misplacing every Center hungry desire &amp; lust began Gathering the fruit of that Mysterious tree till Urizen Sitting within his temple furious felt the num[m]ing stupor Himself tangled in his own net in sorrow lust repentance Enitharmon wove in tears Singing Songs of Lamentations And pitying comfort as she sighd forth on the wind the spectres And wove them bodies calling them her belovd sons &amp; daughters Employing the daughters in her looms &amp; Los employd the Sons In Golgonoozas Furnaces among the Anvils of time &amp; space Thus forming a Vast family wondrous in beauty &amp; love And they appeard a Universal female form created From those who were dead in Ulro from the Spectres of the dead And Enitharmon namd the Female Jerusa[le]m the holy Wondring she saw the Lamb of God within Jerusalems Veil The divine Vision seen within the inmost deep recess Of fair Jerusalems bosom in a gently beaming fire Then sang the Sons of Eden round the Lamb of God &amp; said Glory Glory Glory to the holy Lamb of God Who now beginneth to put off the dark Satanic body Now we behold redemption Now we know that life Eternal Depends alone upon the Universal hand &amp; not in us Is aught but death In individual weakness sorrow &amp; pain We behold with wonder Enitharmons Looms &amp; Los's Forges And the Spindles of Tirzah &amp; Rahab and the Mills of Satan &amp; Beelzeboul In Golgonooza Los's anvils stand &amp; his Furnaces rage Ten thousand demons labour at the forges Creating Continually The times &amp; spaces of Mortal Life the Sun the Moon the Stars In periods of Pulsative furor beating into wedges &amp; bars Then drawing into wires the terrific Passions &amp; Affections Of Spectrous dead.

They wave in awful fear Calling the Lion &amp; the Tyger the horse &amp; the wild Stag The Elephant the wolf the Bear the Lamia the Satyr His Eyelids give their light around his folding tail aspires Among the stars the Earth &amp; all the Abysses feel h[i]s fury When as the snow covers the mountain oft petrific hardness Covers the deeps at his vast fury mo[a]ning in his rock Hardens the Lion &amp; the Bear trembling in the Solid mountain They view the light &amp; wonder crying out in terrible existence Up bound the wild stag &amp; the horse behold the King of Pride Oft doth his Eye emerge from the Abyss into the realms Of his Eternal day &amp; memory strives to augment his ruthfulness Then weeping he descends in wrath drawing all things in his fury Into obedience to his will &amp; now he finds in vain That not of his own power he bore the human form erect Nor of his own will gave his Laws in times of Everlasting For now fierce Orc in wrath &amp; fury rises into the heavens A King of wrath &amp; fury a dark enraged horror And Urizen repentant forgets his wisdom in the abyss In forms of priesthood in the dark delusions of repentance Repining in his heart &amp; spirit that Orc reignd over all And that his wisdom servd but to augment the indefinite lust Then Tharmas &amp; Urthona felt the stony stupor rise Into their limbs Urthona shot forth a Vast Fibrous form Tharmas like a pillar of sand rolld round by the whirlwind An animated Pillar rolling round &amp; round in incessant rage Los felt the stony stupor &amp; his head rolld down beneath Into the Abysses of his bosom the vessels of his blood Dart forth upon the wind in pipes writhing about in the Abyss And Enitharmon pale &amp; cold in milky juices flowd Into a form of Vegetation living having a voice Moving in rootlike fibres trembling in fear upon the Earth And Tharmas gave his Power to Los Urthona gave his strength Into the youthful prophet for the Love of Enitharmon And of the nameless Shadowy female in the nether deep And for the dread of the dark terrors of Orc &amp; Urizen Thus in a living Death the nameless shadow all things bound All mortal things made permanent that they may be put off Time after time by the Divine Lamb who died for all And all in him died. &amp; he put off all mortality Tharmas on high rode furious thro the afflicted worlds Pursuing the Vain Shadow of Hope fleeing from identity In abstract false Expanses that he may not hear the Voice Of Ahania wailing on the winds in vain he flies for still The voice incessant calls on all the children of Men For she spoke of all in heaven &amp; all upon the Earth Saw not as yet the Divine vision her Eyes are Toward Urizen And thus Ahania cries aloud to the Caverns of the Grave Will you keep a flock of wolves &amp; lead them will you take the wintry blast For a covering to your limbs or the summer pestilence for a tent to abide in Will you erect a lasting habitation in the mouldering Church yard Or a pillar &amp; palace of Eternity in the jaws of the hungry grave Will you seek pleasure from the festering wound or marry for a Wife The ancient Leprosy that the King &amp; Priest may still feast on your decay And the grave mock &amp; laugh at the plowd field saying I am the nourisher thou the destroyer in my bosom is milk &amp; wine And a fountain from my breasts to me come all multitudes To my breath they obey they worship me I am a goddess &amp; queen But listen to Ahania O ye sons of the Murderd one Listen to her whose memory beholds your ancient days Listen to her whose eyes behold the dark body of corruptible death Looking for Urizen in vain. in vain I seek for morning The Eternal Man sleeps in the Earth nor feels the vigrous sun Nor silent moon nor all the hosts of heaven move in his body His fiery halls are dark &amp; round his limbs the Serpent Orc Fold without fold encompasses him And his corrupting members Vomit out the Scaly monsters of the restless deep They come up in the rivers &amp; annoy the nether parts Of Man who lays upon the shores leaning his faded head Upon the Oozy rock inwrapped with the weeds of death His eyes sink hollow in his head his flesh coverd with slime And shrunk up to the bones alas that Man should come to this His strong bones beat with snows &amp; hid within the caves of night Marrowless bloodless falling into dust driven by the winds O how the horrors of Eternal Death take hold on Man His faint groans shake the caves &amp; issue thro the desolate rocks And the Strong Eagle now with num[m]ing cold blighted of feathers Once like the pride of the sun now flagging in cold night Hovers with blasted wings aloft watching with Eager Eye Till Man shall leave a corruptible body he famishd hears him groan And now he fixes his strong talons in the pointed rock And now he beats the heavy air with his enormous wings Beside him lies the Lion dead &amp; in his belly worms Feast on his death till universal death devours all And the pale horse seeks for the pool to lie him down &amp; die But finds the pools filled with serpents devouring one another He droops his head &amp; trembling stands &amp; his bright eyes decay These are the Visions of My Eyes the Visions of Ahania Thus cries Ahania Enion replies from the Caverns of the Grave Fear not O poor forsaken one O land of briars &amp; thorns Where once the Olive flourishd &amp; the Cedar spread his wings Once I waild desolate like thee my fallow fields in fear Cried to the Churchyards &amp; the Earthworm came in dismal state I found him in my bosom &amp; I said the time of Love Appears upon the rocks &amp; hills in silent shades but soon A voice came in the night a midnight cry upon the mountains Awake the bridegroom cometh I awoke to sleep no more But an Eternal Consummation is dark Enion The watry Grave. O thou Corn field O thou Vegetater happy More happy is the dark consumer hope drowns all my torment For I am now surrounded by a shadowy vortex drawing The Spectre quite away from Enion that I die a death Of bitter hope altho I consume in these raging waters The furrowd field replies to the grave I hear her reply to me Behold the time approaches fast that thou shalt be as a thing Forgotten when one speaks of thee he will not be believd When the man gently fades away in his immortality When the mortal disappears in improved knowledge cast away The former things so shall the Mortal gently fade away And so become invisible to those who still remain Listen I will tell thee what is done in the caverns of the grave The Lamb of God has rent the Veil of Mystery soon to return In Clouds &amp; Fires around the rock &amp; the Mysterious tree As the seed waits Eagerly watching for its flower &amp; fruit Anxious its little soul looks out into the clear expanse To see if hungry winds are abroad with their invisible army So Man looks out in tree &amp; herb &amp; fish &amp; bird &amp; beast Collecting up the scatterd portions of his immortal body Into the Elemental forms of every thing that grows He tries the sullen north wind riding on its angry furrows The sultry south when the sun rises &amp; the angry east When the sun sets when the clods harden &amp; the cattle stand Drooping &amp; the birds hide in their silent nests. he stores his thoughts As in a store house in his memory he regulates the forms Of all beneath &amp; all above &amp; in the gentle West Reposes where the Suns heat dwells he rises to the Sun And to the Planets of the Night &amp; to the stars that gild The Zodiac &amp; the stars that sullen stand to north &amp; south He touches the remotest pole &amp; in the Center weeps That Man should Labour &amp; sorrow &amp; learn &amp; forget &amp; return To the dark valley whence he came to begin his labours anew In pain he sighs in pain he labours in his universe Screaming in birds over the deep &amp; howling in the Wolf Over the slain &amp; moaning in the cattle &amp; in the winds And weeping over Orc &amp; Urizen in clouds &amp; flaming fires And in the cries of birth &amp; in the groans of death his voice Is heard throughout the Universe whereever a grass grows Or a leaf buds The Eternal Man is seen is heard is felt And all his Sorrows till he reassumes his ancient bliss Such are the words of Ahania &amp; Enion. Los hears &amp; weeps And Los &amp; Enitharmon took the Body of the Lamb Down from the Cross &amp; placd it in a Sepulcher which Los had hewn For himself in the Rock of Eternity trembling &amp; in despair Jerusalem wept over the Sepulcher two thousand Years Rahab triumphs over all she took Jerusalem Captive A Willing Captive by delusive arts impelld To worship Urizens Dragon form to offer her own Children Upon the bloody Altar. John Saw these things Reveald in Heaven On Patmos Isle &amp; heard the Souls cry out to be deliverd He saw the Harlot of the Kings of Earth &amp; saw her Cup Of fornication food of Orc &amp; Satan pressd from the fruit of Mystery But when she saw the form of Ahania weeping on the Void And heard Enions voice sound from the caverns of the Grave No more spirit remaind in her She secretly left the Synagogue of Satan She commund with Orc in secret She hid him with the flax That Enitharmon had numberd away from the Heavens She gatherd it together to consume her Harlot Robes In bitterest Contrition sometimes Self condemning repentant And Sometimes kissing her Robes &amp; Jewels &amp; weeping over them Sometimes returning to the Synagogue of Satan in Pride And Sometimes weeping before Orc in humility &amp; trembling The Synagogue of Satan therefore uniting against Mystery Satan divided against Satan resolvd in open Sanhedrim To burn Mystery with fire &amp; form another from her ashes For God put it into their heart to fulfill all his will The Ashes of Mystery began to animate they calld it Deism And Natural Religion as of old so now anew began Babylon again in Infancy Calld Natural Religion [End of the Eighth Night] Vala Night the Ninth Being The Last Judgment And Los &amp; Enitharmon builded Jerusalem weeping Over the Sepulcher &amp; over the Crucified body Which to their Phantom Eyes appear'd still in the Sepulcher But Jesus stood beside them in the Spirit Separating Their Spirit from their body. Terrified at Non Existence For such they deemd the death of the body. Los his vegetable hands Outstretchd his right hand branching out in fibrous Strength Siezd the Sun. His left hand like dark roots coverd the Moon And tore them down cracking the heavens across from immense to immense Then fell the fires of Eternity with loud &amp; shrill Sound of Loud Trumpet thundering along from heaven to heaven A mighty sound articulate Awake ye dead &amp; come To Judgment from the four winds Awake &amp; Come away Folding like scrolls of the Enormous volume of Heaven &amp; Earth With thunderous noise &amp; dreadful shakings rocking to &amp; fro The heavens are shaken &amp; the Earth removed from its place The foundations of the Eternal hills discoverd The thrones of Kings are shaken they have lost their robes &amp; crowns The poor smite their opressors they awake up to the harvest The naked warriors rush together down to the sea shore Trembling before the multitudes of slaves now set at liberty They are become like wintry flocks like forests stripd of leaves The opressed pursue like the wind there is no room for escape The Spectre of Enitharmon let loose on the troubled deep Waild shrill in the confusion &amp; the Spectre of Urthona Recievd her in the darkning South their bodies lost they stood Trembling &amp; weak a faint embrace a fierce desire as when Two shadows mingle on a wall they wail &amp; shadowy tears Fell down &amp; shadowy forms of joy mixd with despair &amp; grief Their bodies buried in the ruins of the Universe Mingled with the confusion. Who shall call them from the Grave Rahab &amp; Tirzah wail aloud in the wild flames they give up themselves to Consummation The books of Urizen unroll with dreadful noise the folding Serpent Of Orc began to Consume in fierce raving fire his fierce flames Issud on all sides gathring strength in animating volumes Roaming abroad on all the winds raging intense reddening Into resistless pillars of fire rolling round &amp; round gathering Strength from the Earths consumd &amp; heavens &amp; all hidden abysses Wherever the Eagle has Explord or Lion or Tyger trod Or where the Comets of the night or stars of asterial day Have shot their arrows or long beamed spears in wrath &amp; fury And all the while the trumpet sounds from the clotted gore &amp; from the hollow den Start forth the trembling millions into flames of mental fire Bathing their limbs in the bright visions of Eternity Then like the doves from pillars of Smoke the trembling families Of women &amp; children throughout every nation under heaven Cling round the men in bands of twenties &amp; of fifties pale As snow that falls around a leafless tree upon the green Their opressors are falln they have Stricken them they awake to life Yet pale the just man stands erect &amp; looking up to heavn Trembling &amp; strucken by the Universal stroke the trees unroot The rocks groan horrible &amp; run about. The mountains &amp; Their rivers cry with a dismal cry the cattle gather together Lowing they kneel before the heavens. the wild beasts of the forests Tremble the Lion shuddering asks the Leopard. Feelest thou The dread I feel unknown before My voice refuses to roar And in weak moans I speak to thee This night Before the mornings dawn the Eagle calld the Vulture The Raven calld the hawk I heard them from my forests black Saying Let us go up far for soon I smell upon the wind A terror coming from the South. The Eagle &amp; Hawk fled away At dawn &amp; Eer the sun arose the raven &amp; Vulture followd Let us flee also to the north. They fled. The Sons of Men Saw them depart in dismal droves. The trumpet sounded loud And all the Sons of Eternity Descended into Beulah In the fierce flames the limbs of Mystery lay consuming with howling And deep despair. Rattling go up the flames around the Synagogue Of Satan Loud the Serpent Orc ragd thro his twenty Seven Folds. The tree of Mystery went up in folding flames Blood issud out in mighty volumes pouring in whirlpools fierce From out the flood gates of the Sky The Gates are burst down pour The torrents black upon the Earth the blood pours down incessant Kings in their palaces lie drownd Shepherds their flocks their tents Roll down the mountains in black torrents Cities Villages High spires &amp; Castles drownd in the black deluge Shoal on Shoal Float the dead carcases of Men &amp; Beasts driven to &amp; fro on waves Of foaming blood beneath the black incessant Sky till all Mysterys tyrants are cut off &amp; not one left on Earth And when all Tyranny was cut off from the face of Earth Around the Dragon form of Urizen &amp; round his stony form The flames rolling intense thro the wide Universe Began to Enter the Holy City Entring the dismal clouds In furrowd lightnings break their way the wild flames whirring up The Bloody Deluge living flames winged with intellect And Reason round the Earth they march in order flame by flame From the clotted gore &amp; from the hollow den Start forth the trembling millions into flames of mental fire Bathing their Limbs in the bright visions of Eternity Beyond this Universal Confusion beyond the remotest Pole Where their vortexes begin to operate there stands A Horrible rock far in the South it was forsaken when Urizen gave the horses of Light into the hands of Luvah On this rock lay the faded head of the Eternal Man Enwrapped round with weeds of death pale cold in sorrow &amp; woe He lifts the blue lamps of his Eyes &amp; cries with heavenly voice Bowing his head over the consuming Universe he cried O weakness &amp; O weariness O war within my members My sons exiled from my breast pass to &amp; fro before me My birds are silent on my hills flocks die beneath my branches My tents are fallen my trumpets &amp; the sweet sounds of my harp Is silent on my clouded hills that belch forth storms &amp; fires My milk of cows &amp; honey of bees &amp; fruit of golden harvest Are gatherd in the scorching heat &amp; in the driving rain My robe is turned to confusion &amp; my bright gold to stones Where once I sat I weary walk in misery &amp; pain For from within my witherd breast grown narrow with my woes The Corn is turnd to thistles &amp; the apples into poison The birds of song to murderous crows My joys to bitter groans The voices of children in my tents to cries of helpless infants And all exiled from the face of light &amp; shine of morning In this dark world a narrow house I wander up &amp; down I hear Mystery howling in these flames of Consummation When shall the Man of future times become as in days of old O weary life why sit I here &amp; give up all my powers To indolence to the night of death when indolence &amp; mourning Sit hovring over my dark threshold. tho I arise look out And scorn the war within my members yet my heart is weak And my head faint Yet will I look again unto the morning Whence is this sound of rage of Men drinking each others blood Drunk with the smoking gore &amp; red but not with nourishing wine The Eternal Man sat on the Rocks &amp; cried with awful voice O Prince of Light where art thou I behold thee not as once In those Eternal fields in clouds of morning stepping forth With harps &amp; songs where bright Ahania sang before thy face And all thy sons &amp; daughters gatherd round my ample table See you not all this wracking furious confusion Come forth from slumbers of thy cold abstraction come forth Arise to Eternal births shake off thy cold repose Schoolmaster of souls great opposer of change arise That the Eternal worlds may see thy face in peace &amp; joy That thou dread form of Certainty maist sit in town &amp; village While little children play around thy feet in gentle awe Fearing thy frown loving thy smile O Urizen Prince of light He calld the deep buried his voice &amp; answer none returnd Then wrath burst round the Eternal Man was wrath again he cried Arise O stony form of death O dragon of the Deeps Lie down before my feet O Dragon let Urizen arise O how couldst thou deform those beautiful proportions Of life &amp; person for as the Person so is his life proportiond Let Luvah rage in the dark deep even to Consummation For if thou feedest not his rage it will subside in peace But if thou darest obstinate refuse my stern behest Thy crown &amp; scepter I will sieze &amp; regulate all my members In stern severity &amp; cast thee out into the indefinite Where nothing lives, there to wander. &amp; if thou returnst weary Weeping at the threshold of Existence I will steel my heart Against thee to Eternity &amp; never recieve thee more Thy self destroying beast formd Science shall be thy eternal lot My anger against thee is greater than against this Luvah For war is energy Enslavd but thy religion The first author of this war &amp; the distracting of honest minds Into confused perturbation &amp; strife &amp; honour &amp; pride Is a deceit so detestable that I will cast thee out If thou repentest not &amp; leave thee as a rotten branch to be burnd With Mystery the Harlot &amp; with Satan for Ever &amp; Ever Error can never be redeemd in all Eternity But Sin Even Rahab is redeemd in blood &amp; fury &amp; jealousy That line of blood that stretchd across the windows of the morning Redeemd from Errors power. Wake thou dragon of the deeps Urizen wept in the dark deep anxious his Scaly form To reassume the human &amp; he wept in the dark deep Saying O that I had never drank the wine nor eat the bread Of dark mortal nor cast my view into futurity nor turnd My back darkning the present clouding with a cloud And building arches high &amp; cities turrets &amp; towers &amp; domes Whose smoke destroyd the pleasant garden &amp; whose running Kennels Chokd the bright rivers burdning with my Ships the angry deep Thro Chaos seeking for delight &amp; in spaces remote Seeking the Eternal which is always present to the wise Seeking for pleasure which unsought falls round the infants path And on the fleeces of mild flocks who neither care nor labour But I the labourer of ages whose unwearied hands Are thus deformd with hardness with the sword &amp; with the spear And with the Chisel &amp; the mallet I whose labours vast Order the nations separating family by family Alone enjoy not I alone in misery supreme Ungratified give all my joy unto this Luvah &amp; Vala Then Go O dark futurity I will cast thee forth from these Heavens of my brain nor will I look upon futurity more I cast futurity away &amp; turn my back upon that void Which I have made for lo futurity is in this moment Let Orc consume let Tharmas rage let dark Urthona give All strength to Los &amp; Enitharmon &amp; let Los self cursd Rend down this fabric as a wall ruind &amp; family extinct Rage Orc Rage Tharmas Urizen no longer curbs your rage So Urizen spoke he shook his snows from off his Shoulders &amp; arose As on a Pyramid of mist his white robes scattering The fleecy white renewd he shook his aged mantles off Into the fires Then glorious bright Exulting in his joy He sounding rose into the heavens in naked majesty In radiant Youth. when Lo like garlands in the Eastern sky When vocal may comes dancing from the East Ahania came Exulting in her flight as when a bubble rises up On to the surface of a lake. Ahania rose in joy Excess of Joy is worse than grief—her heart beat high her blood Burst its bright Vessels She fell down dead at the feet of Urizen Outstretchd a Smiling corse they buried her in a silent cave Urizen dropt a tear the Eternal Man Darkend with sorrow The three daughters of Urizen guard Ahanias Death couch Rising from the confusion in tears &amp; howlings &amp; despair Calling upon their fathers Name upon their Rivers dark And the Eternal Man Said Hear my words O Prince of Light Behold Jerusalem in whose bosom the Lamb of God Is seen tho slain before her Gates he self renewd remains Eternal &amp; I thro him awake from deaths dark vale The times revolve the time is coming when all these delights Shall be renewd &amp; all these Elements that now consume Shall reflourish. Then bright Ahania shall awake from death A glorious Vision to thine Eyes a Self renewing Vision The spring. the summer to be thine then sleep the wintry days In silken garments spun by her own hands against her funeral The winter thou shalt plow &amp; lay thy stores into thy barns Expecting to recieve Ahania in the spring with joy Immortal thou. Regenerate She &amp; all the lovely Sex From her shall learn obedience &amp; prepare for a wintry grave That spring may see them rise in tenfold joy &amp; sweet delight Thus shall the male &amp; female live the life of Eternity Because the Lamb of God Creates himself a bride &amp; wife That we his Children evermore may live in Jerusalem Which now descendeth out of heaven a City yet a Woman Mother of myriads redeemd &amp; born in her spiritual palaces By a New Spiritual birth Regenerated from Death Urizen said.

Thrown down from their high Station In the Eternal heavens of Human Imagination: buried beneath In dark oblivion with incessant pangs ages on ages In Enmity &amp; war first weakend then in stern repentance They must renew their brightness &amp; their disorganizd functions Again reorganize till they resume the image of the human Cooperating in the bliss of Man obeying his Will Servants to the infinite &amp; Eternal of the Human form Luvah &amp; Vala descended &amp; enterd the Gates of Dark Urthona And walkd from the hands of Urizen in the shadows of Valas Garden Where the impressions of Despair &amp; Hope for ever vegetate In flowers in fruits in fishes birds &amp; beasts &amp; clouds &amp; waters The land of doubts &amp; shadows sweet delusions unformd hopes They saw no more the terrible confusion of the wracking universe They heard not saw not felt not all the terrible confusion For in their orbed senses within closd up they wanderd at will And those upon the Couches viewd them in the dreams of Beulah As they reposd from the terrible wide universal harvest Invisible Luvah in bright clouds hoverd over Valas head And thus their ancient golden age renewd for Luvah spoke With voice mild from his golden Cloud upon the breath of morning Come forth O Vala from the grass &amp; from the silent Dew Rise from the dews of death for the Eternal Man is Risen She rises among flowers &amp; looks toward the Eastern clearness She walks yea runs her feet are wingd on the tops of the bending grass Her garments rejoice in the vocal wind &amp; her hair glistens with dew She answerd thus Whose voice is this in the voice of the nourishing air In the spirit of the morning awaking the Soul from its grassy bed Where dost thou dwell for it is thee I seek &amp; but for thee I must have slept Eternally nor have felt the dew of thy morning Look how the opening dawn advances with vocal harmony Look how the beams foreshew the rising of some glorious power The sun is thine he goeth forth in his majestic brightness O thou creating voice that callest &amp; who shall answer thee Where dost thou flee O fair one where dost thou seek thy happy place To yonder brightness there I haste for sure I came from thence Or I must have slept eternally nor have felt the dew of morning Eternally thou must have slept nor have felt the morning dew But for yon nourishing sun tis that by which thou art arisen The birds adore the sun the beasts rise up &amp; play in his beams And every flower &amp; every leaf rejoices in his light Then O thou fair one sit thee down for thou art as the grass Thou risest in the dew of morning &amp; at night art folded up Alas am I but as a flower then will I sit me down Then will I weep then Ill complain &amp; sigh for immortality And chide my maker thee O Sun that raisedst me to fall So saying she sat down &amp; wept beneath the apple trees O be thou blotted out thou Sun that raisedst me to trouble That gavest me a heart to crave &amp; raisedst me thy phantom To feel thy heat &amp; see thy light &amp; wander here alone Hopeless if I am like the grass &amp; so shall pass away Rise sluggish Soul why sitst thou here why dost thou sit &amp; weep Yon Sun shall wax old &amp; decay but thou shalt ever flourish The fruit shall ripen &amp; fall down &amp; the flowers consume away But thou shalt still survive arise O dry thy dewy tears Hah! Shall I still survive whence came that sweet &amp; comforting voice And whence that voice of sorrow O sun thou art nothing now to me Go on thy course rejoicing &amp; let us both rejoice together I walk among his flocks &amp; hear the bleating of his lambs O that I could behold his face &amp; follow his pure feet I walk by the footsteps of his flocks come hither tender flocks Can you converse with a pure Soul that seeketh for her maker You answer not then am I set your mistress in this garden Ill watch you &amp; attend your footsteps you are not like the birds That sing &amp; fly in the bright air but you do lick my feet And let me touch your wooly backs follow me as I sing For in my bosom a new song arises to my Lord Rise up O Sun most glorious minister &amp; light of day Flow on ye gentle airs &amp; bear the voice of my rejoicing Wave freshly clear waters flowing around the tender grass And thou sweet smelling ground put forth thy life in fruits &amp; flowers Follow me O my flocks &amp; hear me sing my rapturous Song I will cause my voice to be heard on the clouds that glitter in the sun I will call &amp; who shall answer me I will sing who shall reply For from my pleasant hills behold the living living springs Running among my green pastures delighting among my trees I am not here alone my flocks you are my brethren And you birds that sing &amp; adorn the sky you are my sisters I sing &amp; you reply to my Song I rejoice &amp; you are glad Follow me O my flocks we will now descend into the valley O how delicious are the grapes flourishing in the Sun How clear the spring of the rock running among the golden sand How cool the breezes of the vally &amp; the arms of the branching trees Cover us from the Sun come &amp; let us sit in the Shade My Luvah here hath placd me in a Sweet &amp; pleasant Land And given me fruits &amp; pleasant waters &amp; warm hills &amp; cool valleys Here will I build myself a house &amp; here Ill call on his name Here Ill return when I am weary &amp; take my pleasant rest So spoke the Sinless Soul &amp; laid her head on the downy fleece Of a curld Ram who stretchd himself in sleep beside his mistress And soft sleep fell upon her eyelids in the silent noon of day Then Luvah passed by &amp; saw the sinless Soul And said Let a pleasant house arise to be the dwelling place Of this immortal Spirit growing in lower Paradise He spoke &amp; pillars were builded &amp; walls as white as ivory The grass she slept upon was pavd with pavement as of pearl Beneath her rose a downy bed &amp; a cieling coverd all Vala awoke. When in the pleasant gates of sleep I enterd I saw my Luvah like a spirit stand in the bright air Round him stood spirits like me who reard me a bright house And here I see thee house remain in my most pleasant world My Luvah smild I kneeled down he laid his hand on my head And when he laid his hand upon me from the gates of sleep I came Into this bodily house to tend my flocks in my pleasant garden So saying she arose &amp; walked round her beautiful house And then from her white door she lookd to see her bleating lambs But her flocks were gone up from beneath the trees into the hills I see the hand that leadeth me doth also lead my flocks She went up to her flocks &amp; turned oft to see her shining house She stopd to drink of the clear spring &amp; eat the grapes &amp; apples She bore the fruits in her lap she gatherd flowers for her bosom She called to her flocks saying follow me o my flocks They followd her to the silent vally beneath the spreading trees And on the rivers margin she ungirded her golden girdle She stood in the river &amp; viewd herself within the watry glass And her bright hair was wet with the waters She rose up from the river And as she rose her Eyes were opend to the world of waters She saw Tharmas sitting upon the rocks beside the wavy sea He strokd the water from his beard &amp; mournd faint thro the summer vales And Vala stood on the rocks of Tharmas &amp; heard his mournful voice O Enion my weary head is in the bed of death For weeds of death have wrapd around my limbs in the hoary deeps I sit in the place of shells &amp; mourn &amp; thou art closd in clouds When will the time of Clouds be past &amp; the dismal night of Tharmas Arise O Enion Arise &amp; smile upon my head As thou dost smile upon the barren mountains and they rejoice When wilt thou smile on Tharmas O thou bringer of golden day Arise O Enion arise for Lo I have calmd my seas So saying his faint head he laid upon the Oozy rock And darkness coverd all the deep the light of Enion faded Like a fa[i]nt flame quivering upon the surface of the darkness Then Vala lifted up her hands to heaven to call on Enion She calld but none could answer her &amp; the Eccho of her voice returnd Where is the voice of God that calld me from the silent dew Where is the Lord of Vala dost thou hide in clefts of the rock Why shouldst thou hide thyself from Vala from the soul that wanders desolate She ceas'd &amp; light beamd round her like the glory of the morning And She arose out of the river &amp; girded on her golden girdle And now her feet step on the grassy bosom of the ground Among her flocks &amp; she turnd her eyes toward her pleasant house And saw in the door way beneath the trees two little children playing She drew near to her house &amp; her flocks followd her footsteps The Children clung around her knees she embracd them &amp; wept over them Thou little Boy art Tharmas &amp; thou bright Girl Enion How are ye thus renewd &amp; brought into the Gardens of Vala She embracd them in tears. till the sun descended the western hills And then she enterd her bright house leading her mighty children And when night came the flocks laid round the house beneath the trees She laid the Children on the beds which she saw prepard in the house Then last herself laid down &amp; closd her Eyelids in soft slumbers And in the morning when the Sun arose in the crystal sky Vala awoke &amp; calld the children from their gentle slumbers Awake O Enion awake &amp; let thine innocent Eyes Enlighten all the Crystal house of Vala awake awake Awake Tharmas awake awake thou child of dewy tears Open the orbs of thy blue eyes &amp; smile upon my gardens The Children woke &amp; smild on Vala. she kneeld by the golden couch She presd them to her bosom &amp; her pearly tears dropd down O my sweet Children Enion let Tharmas kiss thy Cheek Why dost thou turn thyself away from his sweet watry eyes Tharmas henceforth in Valas bosom thou shalt find sweet peace O bless the lovely eyes of Tharmas &amp; the Eyes of Enion They rose they went out wandring sometimes together sometimes alone Why weepest thou Tharmas Child of tears in the bright house of joy Doth Enion avoid the sight of thy blue heavenly Eyes And dost thou wander with my lambs &amp; wet their innocent faces With thy bright tears because the steps of Enion are in the gardens Arise sweet boy &amp; let us follow the path of Enion So saying they went down into the garden among the fruits And Enion sang among the flowers that grew among the trees And Vala said Go Tharmas weep not Go to Enion He said O Vala I am sick &amp; all this garden of Pleasure Swims like a dream before my eyes but the sweet smelling fruit Revives me to new deaths I fade even like a water lilly In the suns heat till in the night on the couch of Enion I drink new life &amp; feel the breath of sleeping Enion But in the morning she arises to avoid my Eyes Then my loins fade &amp; in the house I sit me down &amp; weep Chear up thy Countenance bright boy &amp; go to Enion Tell her that Vala waits her in the shadows of her garden He went with timid steps &amp; Enion like the ruddy morn When infant spring appears in swelling buds &amp; opening flowers Behind her Veil withdraws so Enion turnd her modest head But Tharmas spoke Vala seeks thee sweet Enion in the shades Follow the steps of Tharmas, O thou brightness of the gardens He took her hand reluctant she followd in infant doubts Thus in Eternal Childhood straying among Valas flocks In infant sorrow &amp; joy alternate Enion &amp; Tharmas playd Round Vala in the Gardens of Vala &amp; by her rivers margin They are the shadows of Tharmas &amp; of Enion in Valas world And the sleepers who rested from their harvest work beheld these visions Thus were the sleepers entertaind upon the Couches of Beulah When Luvah &amp; Vala were closd up in their world of shadowy forms Darkness was all beneath the heavens only a little light Such as glows out from sleeping spirits appeard in the deeps beneath As when the wind sweeps over a Corn field the noise of souls Thro all the immense borne down by Clouds swagging in autumnal heat Muttering along from heaven to heaven hoarse roll the human forms Beneath thick clouds dreadful lightnings burst &amp; thunders roll Down pour the torrent Floods of heaven on all the human harvest Then Urizen sitting at his repose on beds in the bright South Cried Times are Ended he Exulted he arose in joy he exulted He pourd his light &amp; all his Sons &amp; daughters pourd their light To exhale the spirits of Luvah &amp; Vala thro the atmosphere And Luvah &amp; Vala saw the Light their spirits were Exhald In all their ancient innocence the floods depart the clouds Dissipate or sink into the Seas of Tharmas Luvah sat Above on the bright heavens in peace. the Spirits of Men beneath Cried out to be deliverd &amp; the Spirit of Luvah wept Over the human harvest &amp; over Vala the sweet wanderer In pain the human harvest wavd in horrible groans of woe The Universal Groan went up the Eternal Man was Darkend Then Urizen arose &amp; took his Sickle in his hand There is a brazen sickle &amp; a scythe of iron hid Deep in the South guarded by a few solitary stars This sickle Urizen took the scythe his sons embracd And went forth &amp; began to reap &amp; all his joyful sons Reapd the wide Universe &amp; bound in Sheaves a wondrous harvest They took them into the wide barns with loud rejoicings &amp; triumph Of flute &amp; harp &amp; drum &amp; trumpet horn &amp; clarion The feast was spread in the bright South &amp; the Regenerate Man Sat at the feast rejoicing &amp; the wine of Eternity Was servd round by the flames of Luvah all Day &amp; all the Night And when Morning began to dawn upon the distant hills a whirlwind rose up in the Center &amp; in the Whirlwind a shriek And in the Shriek a rattling of bones &amp; in the rattling of bones A dolorous groan &amp; from the dolorous groan in tears Rose Enion like a gentle light &amp; Enion spoke saying O Dreams of Death the human form dissolving companied By beasts &amp; worms &amp; creeping things &amp; darkness &amp; despair The clouds fall off from my wet brow the dust from my cold limbs Into the Sea of Tharmas Soon renewd a Golden Moth I shall cast off my death clothes &amp; Embrace Tharmas again For Lo the winter melted away upon the distant hills And all the black mould sings. She speaks to her infant race her milk Descends down on the sand. the thirsty sand drinks &amp; rejoices Wondering to behold the Emmet the Grasshopper the jointed worm The roots shoot thick thro the solid rocks bursting their way They cry out in joys of existence. the broad stems Rear on the mountains stem after stem the scaly newt creeps From the stone &amp; the armed fly springs from the rocky crevice The spider. The bat burst from the hardend slime crying To one another What are we &amp; whence is our joy &amp; delight Lo the little moss begins to spring &amp; the tender weed Creeps round our secret nest. Flocks brighten the Mountains Herds throng up the Valley wild beasts fill the forests Joy thrilld thro all the Furious form of Tharmas humanizing Mild he Embracd her whom he sought he raisd her thro the heavens Sounding his trumpet to awake the dead on high he soard Over the ruind worlds the smoking tomb of the Eternal Prophet The Eternal Man arose He welcomd them to the Feast The feast was spread in the bright South &amp; the Eternal Man Sat at the feast rejoicing &amp; the wine of Eternity Was servd round by the flames of Luvah all day &amp; all the night And Many Eternal Men sat at the golden feast to see The female form now separate They shudderd at the horrible thing Not born for the sport and amusement of Man but born to drink up all his powers They wept to see their shadows they said to one another this is Sin This is the Generative world they rememberd the Days of old And One of the Eternals spoke All was silent at the feast Man is a Worm wearied with joy he seeks the caves of sleep Among the Flowers of Beulah in his Selfish cold repose Forsaking Brotherhood &amp; Universal love in selfish clay Folding the pure wings of his mind seeking the places dark Abstracted from the roots of Science then inclosd around In walls of Gold we cast him like a Seed into the Earth Till times &amp; spaces have passd over him duly every morn We visit him covering with a Veil the immortal seed With windows from the inclement sky we cover him &amp; with walls And hearths protect the Selfish terror till divided all In families we see our shadows born. &amp; thence we know That Man subsists by Brotherhood &amp; Universal Love We fall on one anothers necks more closely we embrace Ephesians iii c. 10 v Not for ourselves but for the Eternal family we live Man liveth not by Self alone but in his brothers face Each shall behold the Eternal Father &amp; love &amp; joy abound So spoke the Eternal at the Feast they embracd the New born Man Calling him Brother image of the Eternal Father. they sat down At the immortal tables sounding loud their instruments of joy Calling the Morning into Beulah the Eternal Man rejoicd When Morning dawnd The Eternals rose to labour at the Vintage Beneath they saw their sons &amp; daughters wondering inconceivable At the dark myriads in Shadows in the worlds beneath The morning dawnd Urizen rose &amp; in his hand the Flail Sounds on the Floor heard terrible by all beneath the heavens Dismal loud redounding the nether floor shakes with the sound And all Nations were threshed out &amp; the stars threshd from their husks Then Tharmas took the Winnowing fan the winnowing wind furious Above veerd round by the violent whirlwind driven west &amp; south Tossed the Nations like Chaff into the seas of Tharmas O Mystery Fierce Tharmas cries Behold thy end is come Art thou she that made the nations drunk with the cup of Religion Go down ye Kings &amp; Councillors &amp; Giant Warriors Go down into the depths go down &amp; hide yourselves beneath Go down with horse &amp; Chariots &amp; Trumpets of hoarse war Lo how the Pomp of Mystery goes down into the Caves Her great men howl &amp; throw the dust &amp; rend their hoary hair Her delicate women &amp; children shriek upon the bitter wind Spoild of their beauty their hair rent &amp; their skin shriveld up Lo darkness covers the long pomp of banners on the wind And black horses &amp; armed men &amp; miserable bound captives Where shall the graves recieve them all &amp; where shall be their place And who shall mourn for Mystery who never loosd her Captives Let the slave grinding at the mill run out into the field Let him look up into the heavens &amp; laugh in the bright air Let the inchaind soul shut up in darkness &amp; in sighing Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary years Rise &amp; look out his chains are loose his dungeon doors are open And let his wife &amp; children return from the opressors scourge They look behind at every step &amp; believe it is a dream Are these the Slaves that groand along the streets of Mystery Where are your bonds &amp; task masters are these the prisoners Where are your chains where are your tears why do you look around If you are thirsty there is the river go bathe your parched limbs The good of all the Land is before you for Mystery is no more Then All the Slaves from every Earth in the wide Universe Sing a New Song drowning confusion in its happy notes While the flail of Urizen sounded loud &amp; the winnowing wind of Tharmas So loud so clear in the wide heavens &amp; the song that they sung was this Composed by an African Black from the little Earth of Sotha Aha Aha how came I here so soon in my sweet native land How came I here Methinks I am as I was in my youth When in my fathers house I sat &amp; heard his chearing voice Methinks I see his flocks &amp; herds &amp; feel my limbs renewd And Lo my Brethren in their tents &amp; their little ones around them The song arose to the Golden feast the Eternal Man rejoicd Then the Eternal Man said Luvah the Vintage is ripe arise The sons of Urizen shall gather the vintage with sharp hooks And all thy sons O Luvah bear away the families of Earth I hear the flail of Urizen his barns are full no roo[m] Remains &amp; in the Vineyards stand the abounding sheaves beneath The falling Grapes that odorous burst upon the winds. Arise My flocks &amp; herds trample the Corn my cattle browze upon The ripe Clusters The shepherds shout for Luvah prince of Love Let the Bulls of Luvah tread the Corn &amp; draw the loaded waggon Into the Barn while children glean the Ears around the door Then shall they lift their innocent hands &amp; stroke his furious nose And he shall lick the little girls white neck &amp; on her head Scatter the perfume of his breath while from his mountains high The lion of terror shall come down &amp; bending his bright mane And couching at their side shall eat from the curld boys white lap His golden food and in the evening sleep before the Door Attempting to be more than Man We become less said Luvah As he arose from the bright feast drunk with the wine of ages His crown of thorns fell from his head he hung his living Lyre Behind the seat of the Eternal Man &amp; took his way Sounding the Song of Los descending to the Vineyards bright His sons arising from the feast with golden baskets follow A fiery train as when the Sun sings in the ripe vineyards Then Luvah stood before the wine press all his fiery sons Brought up the loaded Waggons with shoutings ramping tygers play In the jingling traces furious lions sound the song of joy To the golden wheels circling upon the pavement of heaven &amp; all The Villages of Luvah ring the golden tiles of the villages Reply to violins &amp; tabors to the pipe flute lyre &amp; cymbal Then fell the Legions of Mystery in maddning confusion Down Down thro the immense with outcry fury &amp; despair Into the wine presses of Luvah howling fell the Clusters Of human families thro the deep. the wine presses were filld The blood of life flowd plentiful Odors of life arose All round the heavenly arches &amp; the Odors rose singing this song O terrible wine presses of Luvah O caverns of the Grave How lovely the delights of those risen again from death O trembling joy excess of joy is like Excess of grief So sang the Human Odors round the wine presses of Luvah But in the Wine presses is wailing terror &amp; despair Forsaken of their Elements they vanish &amp; are no more No more but a desire of Being a distracted ravening desire Desiring like the hungry worm &amp; like the gaping grave They plunge into the Elements the Elements cast them forth Or else consume their shadowy semblance Yet they obstinate Tho pained to distraction Cry O let us Exist for This dreadful Non Existence is worse than pains of Eternal Birth Eternal Death who can Endure. let us consume in fires In waters stifling or in air corroding or in earth shut up The Pangs of Eternal birth are better than the Pangs of Eternal Death How red the sons &amp; daughters of Luvah how they tread the Grapes Laughing &amp; shouting drunk with odors many fall oerwearied Drownd in the wine is many a youth &amp; maiden those around Lay them on skins of tygers or the spotted Leopard or wild Ass Till they revive or bury them in cool Grots making lamentation But in the Wine Presses the Human Grapes Sing not nor dance They howl &amp; writhe in shoals of torment in fierce flames consuming In chains of iron &amp; in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires In pits &amp; dens &amp; shades of death in shapes of torment &amp; woe The Plates the Screws and Racks &amp; Saws &amp; cords &amp; fires &amp; floods The cruel joy of Luvahs daughters lacerating with knives And whip[s] their Victims &amp; the deadly sports of Luvahs sons Timbrels &amp; Violins sport round the Wine Presses The little Seed The Sportive root the Earthworm the small beetle the wise Emmet Dance round the Wine Presses of Luvah. the Centipede is there The ground Spider with many Eyes the Mole clothed in Velvet The Earwig armd the tender maggot emblem of Immortality The Slow Slug the grasshopper that sings &amp; laughs &amp; drinks The winter comes he folds his slender bones without a murmur There is the Nettle that stings with soft down &amp; there The indignant Thistle whose bitterness is bred in his milk And who lives on the contempt of his neighbour there all the idle weeds That creep about the obscure places shew their various limbs Naked in all their beauty dancing round the Wine Presses They Dance around the Dying &amp; they Drink the howl &amp; groan They catch the Shrieks in cups of gold they hand them to one another These are the sports of love &amp; these the sweet delights of amorous play Tears of the grapes the death sweat of the Cluster the last sigh Of the mild youth who listens to the luring songs of Luvah The Eternal Man darkend with Sorrow &amp; a wintry mantle Coverd the Hills He said O Tharmas rise &amp; O Urthona Then Tharmas &amp; Urthona rose from the Golden feast satiated With Mirth &amp; Joy Urthona limping from his fall on Tharmas leand In his right hand his hammer Tharmas held his Shepherds crook Beset with gold gold were the ornaments formd by sons of Urizen Then Enion &amp;

O thou, with dewy locks, who lookest down Thro' the clear windows of the morning; turn Thine angel eyes upon our western isle, Which in full choir hails thy approach, O Spring! The hills tell each other, and the list'ning Vallies hear; all our longing eyes are turned Up to thy bright pavillions: issue forth, And let thy holy feet visit our clime. Come o'er the eastern hills, and let our winds Kiss thy perfumed garments; let us taste Thy morn and evening breath; scatter thy pearls Upon our love-sick land that mourns for thee. O deck her forth with thy fair fingers; pour Thy soft kisses on her bosom; and put Thy golden crown upon her languish'd head, Whose modest tresses were bound up for thee! TO SUMMER. O thou, who passest thro' our vallies in Thy strength, curb thy fierce steeds, allay the heat That flames from their large nostrils! thou, O Summer, Oft pitched'st here thy golden tent, and oft Beneath our oaks hast slept, while we beheld With joy, thy ruddy limbs and flourishing hair. Beneath our thickest shades we oft have heard Thy voice, when noon upon his fervid car Rode o'er the deep of heaven; beside our springs Sit down, and in our mossy vallies, on Some bank beside a river clear, throw thy Silk draperies off, and rush into the stream: Our vallies love the Summer in his pride. Our bards are fam'd who strike the silver wire: Our youth[s] are bolder than the southern swains: Our maidens fairer in the sprightly dance: We lack not songs, nor instruments of joy, Nor echoes sweet, nor waters clear as heaven, Nor laurel wreaths against the sultry heat. TO AUTUMN O Autumn, laden with fruit, and stained With the blood of the grape, pass not, but sit Beneath my shady roof, there thou may'st rest, And tune thy jolly voice to my fresh pipe; And all the daughters of the year shall dance! Sing now the lusty song of fruits and flowers. “The narrow bud opens her beauties to “The sun, and love runs in her thrilling veins; “Blossoms hang round the brows of morning, and “Flourish down the bright cheek of modest eve, “Till clust'ring Summer breaks forth into singing, “And feather'd clouds strew flowers round her head. “The spirits of the air live on the smells “Of fruit; and joy, with pinions light, roves round “The gardens, or sits singing in the trees.” Thus sang the jolly Autumn as he sat, Then rose, girded himself, and o'er the bleak Hills fled from our sight; but left his golden load. TO WINTER. O Winter! bar thine adamantine doors: The north is thine; there hast thou built thy dark Deep-founded habitation. Shake not thy roofs, Nor bend thy pillars with thine iron car. He hears me not, but o'er the yawning deep Rides heavy; his storms are unchain'd; sheathed In ribbed steel, I dare not lift mine eyes; For he hath rear'd his sceptre o'er the world. Lo! now the direful monster, whose skin clings To his strong bones, strides o'er the groaning rocks: He withers all in silence, and his hand Unclothes the earth, and freezes up frail life. He takes his seat upon the cliffs, the mariner Cries in vain. Poor little wretch! that deal'st With storms; till heaven smiles, and the monster Is driv'n yelling to his caves beneath mount Hecla. TO THE EVENING STAR Thou fair-hair'd angel of the evening, Now, while the sun rests on the mountains, light Thy bright torch of love; thy radiant crown Put on, and smile upon our evening bed! Smile on our loves; and, while thou drawest the Blue curtains of the sky, scatter thy silver dew On every flower that shuts its sweet eyes In timely sleep. Let thy west wind sleep on The lake; speak si[l]ence with thy glimmering eyes, And wash the dusk with silver. Soon, full soon, Dost thou withdraw; then the wolf rages wide, And the lion glares thro' the dun forest: The fleeces of our flocks are cover'd with Thy sacred dew: protect them with thine influence. TO MORNING O holy virgin! clad in purest white, Unlock heav'n's golden gates, and issue forth; Awake the dawn that sleeps in heaven; let light Rise from the chambers of the east, and bring The honied dew that cometh on waking day. O radiant morning, salute the sun, Rouz'd like a huntsman to the chace; and, with Thy buskin'd feet, appear upon our hills. FAIR ELENOR The bell struck one, and shook the silent tower; The graves give up their dead: fair Elenor Walk'd by the castle gate, and looked in. A hollow groan ran thro' the dreary vaults. She shriek'd aloud, and sunk upon the steps On the cold stone her pale cheek. Sickly smells Of death, issue as from a sepulchre, And all is silent but the sighing vaults. Chill death withdraws his hand, and she revives; Amaz'd, she finds herself upon her feet, And, like a ghost, thro' narrow passages Walking, feeling the cold walls with her hands. Fancy returns, and now she thinks of bones, And grinning skulls, and corruptible death, Wrap'd in his shroud; and now, fancies she hears Deep sighs, and sees pale sickly ghosts gliding. At length, no fancy, but reality Distracts her. A rushing sound, and the feet Of one that fled, approaches—Ellen stood, Like a dumb statue, froze to stone with fear. The wretch approaches, crying, “The deed is done; “Take this, and send it by whom thou wilt send; “It is my life—send it to Elenor:— “He's dead, and howling after me for blood! “Take this,” he cry'd; and thrust into her arms A wet napkin, wrap'd about; then rush'd Past, howling: she receiv'd into her arms Pale death, and follow'd on the wings of fear. They pass'd swift thro' the outer gate; the wretch, Howling, leap'd o'er the wall into the moat, Stifling in mud. Fair Ellen pass'd the bridge, And heard a gloomy voice cry, “Is it done?” As the deer wounded Ellen flew over The pathless plain; as the arrows that fly By night; destruction flies, and strikes in darkness, She fled from fear, till at her house arriv'd. Her maids await her; on her bed she falls, That bed of joy, where erst her lord hath press'd: “Ah, woman's fear!” she cry'd; “Ah, cursed duke! “Ah, my dear lord! ah, wretched Elenor! “My lord was like a flower upon the brows “Of lusty May! Ah, life as frail as flower! “O ghastly death! withdraw thy cruel hand, “Seek'st thou that flow'r to deck thy horrid temples? “My lord was like a star, in highest heav'n “Drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness: “My lord was like the opening eyes of day, “When western winds creep softly o'er the flowers: “But he is darken'd; like the summer's noon, “Clouded; fall'n like the stately tree, cut down; “The breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves. “O Elenor, weak woman, fill'd with woe!” Thus having spoke, she raised up her head, And saw the bloody napkin by her side, Which in her arms she brought; and now, tenfold More terrified, saw it unfold itself. Her eyes were fix'd; the bloody cloth unfolds, Disclosing to her sight the murder'd head Of her dear lord, all ghastly pale, clotted With gory blood; it groan'd, and thus it spake: “O Elenor, behold thy husband's head, “Who, sleeping on the stones of yonder tower, “Was 'reft of life by the accursed duke! “A hired villain turn'd my sleep to death! “O Elenor, beware the cursed duke, “O give not him thy hand, now I am dead; “He seeks thy love; who, coward, in the night, “Hired a villain to bereave my life.” She sat with dead cold limbs, stiffen'd to stone; She took the gory head up in her arms; She kiss'd the pale lips; she had no tears to shed; She hugg'd it to her breast, and groan'd her last. SONG [How sweet I roam'd from field to field] How sweet I roam'd from field to field, And tasted all the summer's pride, 'Till I the prince of love beheld, Who in the sunny beams did glide! He shew'd me lilies for my hair, And blushing roses for my brow; He led me through his gardens fair, Where all his golden pleasures grow. With sweet May dews my wings were wet, And Phoebus fir'd my vocal rage; He caught me in his silken net, And shut me in his golden cage. He loves to sit and hear me sing, Then, laughing, sports and plays with me; Then stretches out my golden wing, And mocks my loss of liberty. SONG [My silks and fine array] My silks and fine array, My smiles and languish'd air, By love are driv'n away; And mournful lean Despair Brings me yew to deck my grave: Such end true lovers have. His face is fair as heav'n, When springing buds unfold; O why to him was't giv'n, Whose heart is wintry cold? His breast is love's all worship'd tomb, Where all love's pilgrims come. Bring me an axe and spade, Bring me a winding sheet; When I my grave have made, Let winds and tempests beat: Then down I'll lie, as cold as clay. True love doth pass away! SONG [Love and harmony combine] Love and harmony combine, And around our souls intwine, While thy branches mix with mine, And our roots together join. Joys upon our branches sit, Chirping loud, and singing sweet; Like gentle streams beneath our feet Innocence and virtue meet. Thou the golden fruit dost bear, I am clad in flowers fair; Thy sweet boughs perfume the air, And the turtle buildeth there. There she sits and feeds her young, Sweet I hear her mournful song; And thy lovely leaves among, There is love: I hear his tongue. There his charming nest doth lay, There he sleeps the night away; There he sports along the day, And doth among our branches play. SONG [I love the jocund dance] I love the jocund dance, The softly-breathing song, Where innocent eyes do glance, And where lisps the maiden's tongue. I love the laughing vale, I love the echoing hill, Where mirth does never fail, And the jolly swain laughs his fill. I love the pleasant cot, I love the innocent bow'r. Where white and brown is our lot, Or fruit in the mid-day hour. I love the oaken seat, Beneath the oaken tree, Where all the old villagers meet, And laugh our sports to see. I love our neighbours all, But, Kitty, I better love thee; And love them I ever shall; But thou art all to me. SONG [Memory, hither come] Memory, hither come, And tune your merry notes; And, while upon the wind, Your music floats, I'll pore upon the stream, Where sighing lovers dream, And fish for fancies as they pass Within the watery glass. I'll drink of the clear stream, And hear the linnet's song; And there I'll lie and dream The day along: And, when night comes, I'll go To places fit for woe; Walking along the darken'd valley, With silent Melancholy. MAD SONG The wild winds weep, And the night is a-cold; Come hither, Sleep, And my griefs infold: But lo! the morning peeps Over the eastern steeps, And the rustling birds of dawn The earth do scorn. Lo! to the vault Of paved heaven, With sorrow fraught My notes are driven: They strike the ear of night, Make weep the eyes of day; They make mad the roaring winds, And with tempests play. Like a fiend in a cloud With howling woe, After night I do croud, And with night will go; I turn my back to the east, From whence comforts have increas'd; For light doth seize my brain With frantic pain. SONG [Fresh from the dewy hill, the merry year] Fresh from the dewy hill, the merry year Smiles on my head, and mounts his flaming car; Round my young brows the laurel wreathes a shade, And rising glories beam around my head. My feet are wing'd, while o'er the dewy lawn, I meet my maiden, risen like the morn: Oh bless those holy feet, like angels' feet; Oh bless those limbs, beaming with heav'nly light! Like as an angel glitt'ring in the sky, In times of innocence, and holy joy; The joyful shepherd stops his grateful song, To hear the music of an angel's tongue. So when she speaks, the voice of Heaven I hear So when we walk, nothing impure comes near; Each field seems Eden, and each calm retreat; Each village seems the haunt of holy feet. But that sweet village where my black-ey'd maid, Closes her eyes in sleep beneath night's shade: Whene'er I enter, more than mortal fire Burns in my soul, and does my song inspire. SONG [When early morn walks forth in sober grey] When early morn walks forth in sober grey; Then to my black ey'd maid I haste away, When evening sits beneath her dusky bow'r, And gently sighs away the silent hour; The village bell alarms, away I go; And the vale darkens at my pensive woe. To that sweet village, where my black ey'd maid Doth drop a tear beneath the silent shade, I turn my eyes; and, pensive as I go, Curse my black stars, and bless my pleasing woe. Oft when the summer sleeps among the trees, Whisp'ring faint murmurs to the scanty breeze, I walk the village round; if at her side A youth doth walk in stolen joy and pride, I curse my stars in bitter grief and woe, That made my love so high, and me so low. O should she e'er prove false, his limbs I'd tear, And throw all pity on the burning air; I'd curse bright fortune for my mixed lot, And then I'd die in peace, and be forgot. TO THE MUSES Whether on Ida's shady brow, Or in the chambers of the East, The chambers of the sun, that now From antient melody have ceas'd; Whether in Heav'n ye wander fair, Or the greeen corners of the earth, Or the blue regions of the air, Where the melodious winds have birth; Whether on chrystal rocks ye rove, Beneath the bosom of the sea Wand'ring in many a coral grove, Fair Nine, forsaking Poetry! How have you left the antient love That bards of old enjoy'd in you! The languid strings do scarcely move! The sound is forc'd, the notes are few! GWIN, KING OF NORWAY Come, Kings, and listen to my song, When Gwin, the son of Nore, Over the nations of the North His cruel sceptre bore: The Nobles of the land did feed Upon the hungry Poor; They tear the poor man's lamb, and drive The needy from their door! The land is desolate; our wives And children cry for bread; Arise, and pull the tyrant down; Let Gwin be humbled. Gordred the giant rous'd himself From sleeping in his cave; He shook the hills, and in the clouds The troubl'd banners wave. Beneath them roll'd, like tempests black, The num'rous sons of blood; Like lions' whelps, roaring abroad, Seeking their nightly food. Down Bleron's hills they dreadful rush, Their cry ascends the clouds; The trampling horse, and clanging arms Like rushing mighty floods! Their wives and children, weeping loud, Follow in wild array, Howling like ghosts, furious as wolves In the bleak wintry day. “Pull down the tyrant to the dust, “Let Gwin be humbled,” They cry; “and let ten thousand lives “Pay for the tyrant's head.” From tow'r to tow'r the watchmen cry, “O Gwin, the son of Nore, “Arouse thyself! the nations black, “Like clouds, come rolling o'er!” Gwin rear'd his shield, his palace shakes, His chiefs come rushing round; Each, like an awful thunder cloud, With voice of solemn sound. Like reared stones around a grave They stand around the King; Then suddenly each seiz'd his spear, And clashing steel does ring. The husbandman does leave his plow, To wade thro' fields of gore; The merchant binds his brows in steel, And leaves the trading shore: The shepherd leaves his mellow pipe, And sounds the trumpet shrill; The workman throws his hammer down To heave the bloody bill. Like the tall ghost of Barraton, Who sports in stormy sky, Gwin leads his host as black as night, When pestilence does fly. With horses and with chariots— And all his spearmen bold, March to the sound of mournful song, Like clouds around him roll'd. Gwin lifts his hand—the nations halt; “Prepare for war,” he cries— Gordred appears!—his frowning brow Troubles our northern skies. The armies stand, like balances Held in th'Almighty's hand;— “Gwin, thou hast fill'd thy measure up, “Thou'rt swept from out the land.” And now the raging armies rush'd, Like warring mighty seas; The Heav'ns are shook with roaring war, The dust ascends the skies! Earth smokes with blood, and groans, and shakes, To drink her childrens' gore, A sea of blood; nor can the eye See to the trembling shore! And on the verge of this wild sea Famine and death doth cry; The cries of women and of babes. Over the field doth fly. The King is seen raging afar; With all his men of might; Like blazing comets, scattering death Thro' the red fev'rous night. Beneath his arm like sheep they die, And groan upon the plain; The battle faints, and bloody men Fight upon hills of slain. Now death is sick, and riven men Labour and toil for life; Steed rolls on steed, and shield on shield, Sunk in this sea of strife! The god of war is drunk with blood, The earth doth faint and fail; The stench of blood makes sick the heav'ns; Ghosts glut the throat of hell! O what have Kings to answer for, Before that awful throne! When thousand deaths for vengeance cry, And ghosts accusing groan! Like blazing comets in the sky, That shake the stars of light, Which drop like fruit unto the earth, Thro' the fierce burning night; Like these did Gwin and Gordred meet, And the first blow decides; Down from the brow unto the breast Gordred his head divides! Gwin fell; the Sons of Norway fled, All that remain'd alive; The rest did fill the vale of death, For them the eagles strive. The river Dorman roll'd their blood Into the northern sea; Who mourn'd his sons, and overwhelm'd The pleasant south country. AN IMITATION OF SPEN[S]ER. Golden Apollo, that thro' heaven wide Scatter'st the rays of light, and truth's beams! In lucent words my darkling verses dight, And wash my earthy mind in thy clear streams, That wisdom may descend in fairy dreams: All while the jocund hours in thy train Scatter their fancies at thy poet's feet; And when thou yields to night thy wide domain, Let rays of truth enlight his sleeping brain. For brutish Pan in vain might thee assay With tinkling sounds to dash thy nervous verse, Sound without sense; yet in his rude affray, (For ignorance is Folly's leesing nurse, And love of Folly needs none other curse;) Midas the praise hath gain'd of lengthen'd eares, For which himself might deem him ne'er the worse To sit in council with his modern peers, And judge of tinkling rhimes, and elegances terse. And thou, Mercurius, that with winged brow Dost mount aloft into the yielding sky, And thro' Heav'n's halls thy airy flight dost throw, Entering with holy feet to where on high Jove weighs the counsel of futurity; Then, laden with eternal fate, dost go Down, like a falling star, from autumn sky, And o'er the surface of the silent deep dost fly. If thou arrivest at the sandy shore, Where nought but envious hissing adders dwell, Thy golden rod, thrown on the dusty floor, Can charm to harmony with potent spell; Such is sweet Eloquence, that does dispel Envy and Hate, that thirst for human gore: And cause in sweet society to dwell Vile savage minds that lurk in lonely cell. O Mercury, assist my lab'ring sense, That round the circle of the world wou'd fly! As the wing'd eagle scorns the tow'ry fence Of Alpine hills round his high aery, And searches thro' the corners of the sky, Sports in the clouds to hear the thunder's sound, And see the winged lightnings as they fly, Then, bosom'd in an amber cloud, around Plumes his wide wings, and seeks Sol's palace high. And thou, O warrior, maid invincible, Arm'd with the terrors of Almighty Jove! Pallas, Minerva, maiden terrible, Lov'st thou to walk the peaceful solemn grove, In solemn gloom of branches interwove? Or bear'st thy Egis o'er the burning field, Where, like the sea, the waves of battle move? Or have thy soft piteous eyes beheld The weary wanderer thro' the desert rove? Or does th'afflicted man thy heav'nly bosom move? BLIND-MAN'S BUFF When silver Snow decks Susan's cloaths, And jewel hangs at th'shepherd's nose, The blushing bank is all my care, With hearth so red, and walls so fair; “Heap the sea-coal; come, heap it higher, “The oaken log lay on the fire:” The well-wash'd stools, a circling row, With lad and lass, how fair the show! The merry can of nut-brown ale, The laughing jest, the love-sick tale, 'Till tir'd of chat, the game begins, The lasses prick the lads with pins; Roger from Dolly twitch'd the stool, She falling, kiss'd the ground, poor fool! She blush'd so red, with side-long glance At hob-nail Dick, who griev'd the chance. But now for Blind-man's Buff they call; Of each incumbrance clear the hall— Jenny her silken 'kerchief folds, And blear-ey'd Will the black lot holds; Now laughing, stops, with “Silence! hush!” And Peggy Pout gives Sam a push.— The Blind-man's arms, extended wide, Sam slips between;—“O woe betide Thee, clumsy Will!”—but titt'ring Kate Is pen'd up in the corner strait! And now Will's eyes beheld the play, He thought his face was t'other way.— “Now, Kitty, now; what chance hast thou, “Roger so near thee, Trips; I vow![”] She catches him—then Roger ties His own head up—but not his eyes; For thro' the slender cloth he sees, And runs at Sam, who slips with ease His clumsy hold; and, dodging round, Sukey is tumbled on the ground!— “See what it is to play unfair! “Where cheating is, there's mischief there.” But Roger still pursues the chace,— “He sees! he sees! cries softly Grace; “O Roger, thou, unskill'd in art, “Must, surer bound, go thro' thy part!” Now Kitty, pert, repeats the rhymes, And Roger turns him round three times; Then pauses ere he starts—but Dick Was mischief bent upon a trick: Down on his hands and knees he lay, Directly in the Blind-man's way— Then cries out, “Hem!” Hodge heard, and ran With hood-wink'd chance—sure of his man; But down he came.—Alas, how frail Our best of hopes, how soon they fail! With crimson drops he stains the ground, Confusion startles all around! Poor piteous Dick supports his head, And fain would cure the hurt he made; But Kitty hasted with a key, And down his back they strait convey The cold relief—the blood is stay'd, And Hodge again holds up his head. Such are the fortunes of the game, And those who play should stop the same By wholesome laws; such as[—]all those Who on the blinded man impose Stand in his stead[—]as long a-gone When men were first a nation grown; Lawless they liv'd—till wantonness And liberty began t'increase; And one man lay in another's way, Then laws were made to keep fair play. KING EDWARD THE THIRD. PERSONS. King Edward. The Black Prince. Queen Philippa. Duke of Clarence. Sir John Chandos. Sir Thomas Dagworth. Sir Walter Manny. Lord Audley. Lord Percy. Bishop. William, Dagworth's Man. Peter Blunt, a common Soldier. SCENE [1] The Coast of France, King Edward and Nobles before it. The Army. King. O thou, to whose fury the nations are But as dust! maintain thy servant's right. Without thine aid, the twisted mail, and spear, And forged helm, and shield of seven times beaten brass, Are idle trophies of the vanquisher. When confusion rages, when the field is in a flame, When the cries of blood tear horror from heav'n, And yelling death runs up and down the ranks, Let Liberty, the charter'd right of Englishmen, Won by our fathers in many a glorious field, Enerve my soldiers; let Liberty Blaze in each countenance, and fire the battle. The enemy fight in chains, invisible chains, but heavy; Their minds are fetter'd; then how can they be free, While, like the mounting flame, We spring to battle o'er the floods of death? And these fair youths, the flow'r of England, Vent'ring their lives in my most righteous cause, O sheathe their hearts with triple steel, that they May emulate their fathers' virtues. And thou, my son, be strong; thou fightest for a crown That death can never ravish from thy brow, A crown of glory: but from thy very dust Shall beam a radiance, to fire the breasts Of youth unborn! Our names are written equal In fame's wide trophied hall; 'tis ours to gild The letters, and to make them shine with gold That never tarnishes: whether Third Edward, Or the Prince of Wales, or Montacute, or Mortimer, Or ev'n the least by birth, shall gain the brightest fame, Is in his hand to whom all men are equal. The world of men are like the num'rous stars, That beam and twinkle in the depth of night, Each clad in glory according to his sphere;— But we, that wander from our native seats, And beam forth lustre on a darkling world, Grow larger as we advance! and some perhaps The most obscure at home, that scarce were seen To twinkle in their sphere, may so advance, That the astonish'd world, with up-turn'd eyes, Regardless of the moon, and those that once were bright, Stand only for to gaze upon their splendor! [He here knights the Prince, and other young Nobles. Now let us take a just revenge for those Brave Lords, who fell beneath the bloody axe At Paris. Thanks, noble Harcourt, for 'twas By your advice we landed here in Brittany— A country not yet sown with destruction, And where the fiery whirlwind of swift war Has not yet swept its desolating wing.— Into three parties we divide by day, And separate march, but join again at night: Each knows his rank, and Heav'n marshal all. [Exeunt. SCENE [2] English Court; Lionel, Duke of Clarence; Queen Philippa, Lords, Bishop, &amp;c. Clarence. My Lords, I have, by the advice of her Whom I am doubly bound to obey, my Parent And my Sovereign, call'd you together. My task is great, my burden heavier than My unfledg'd years; Yet, with your kind assistance, Lords, I hope England shall dwell in peace; that while my father Toils in his wars, and turns his eyes on this His native shore, and sees commerce fly round With his white wings, and sees his golden London, And her silver Thames, throng'd with shining spires And corded ships; her merchants buzzing round Like summer bees, and all the golden cities In his land, overflowing with honey, Glory may not be dimm'd with clouds of care. Say, Lords, should not our thoughts be first to commerce? My Lord Bishop, you would recommend us agriculture? Bishop. Sweet Prince! the arts of peace are great, And no less glorious than those of war, Perhaps more glorious in the ph[i]losophic mind. When I sit at my home, a private man, My thoughts are on my gardens, and my fields, How to employ the hand that lacketh bread. If Industry is in my diocese, Religion will flourish; each man's heart Is cultivated, and will bring forth fruit: This is my private duty and my pleasure. But as I sit in council with my prince, My thoughts take in the gen'ral good of the whole, And England is the land favour'd by Commerce; For Commerce, tho' the child of Agriculture, Fosters his parent, who else must sweat and toil, And gain but scanty fare. Then, my dear Lord, Be England's trade our care; and we, as tradesmen, Looking to the gain of this our native land. Clar. O my good Lord, true wisdom drops like honey From your tongue, as from a worship'd oak! Forgive, my Lords, my talkative youth, that speaks Not merely what my narrow observation has Pick'd up, but what I have concluded from your lessons: Now, by the Queen's advice, I ask your leave To dine to-morrow with the Mayor of London: If I obtain your leave, I have another boon To ask, which is, the favour of your company; I fear Lord Percy will not give me leave. Percy. Dear Sir, a prince should always keep his state, And grant his favours with a sparing hand, Or they are never rightly valued. These are my thoughts, yet it were best to go; But keep a proper dignity, for now You represent the sacred person of Your father; 'tis with princes as 'tis with the sun, If not sometimes o'er-clouded, we grow weary Of his officious glory. Clar. Then you will give me leave to shine sometimes, My Lord? Lord. Thou hast a gallant spirit, which I fear Will be imposed on by the closer sort! [Aside. Clar. Well, I'll endeavour to take Lord Percy's advice; I have been used so much To dignity, that I'm sick on't. Queen Phil. Fie, Fie, Lord Clarence; you proceed not to business, But speak of your own pleasures. I hope their Lordships will excuse your giddiness. Clar. My Lords, the French have fitted out many Small ships of war, that, like to ravening wolves, Infest our English seas, devouring all Our burden'd vessels, spoiling our naval flocks. The merchants do complain, and beg our aid. Percy. The merchants are rich enough; Can they not help themselves? Bish. They can, and may; but how to gain their will, Requires our countenance and help. Percy. When that they find they must, my Lord, they will: Let them but suffer awhile, and you shall see They will bestir themselves. Bish. Lord Percy cannot mean that we should suffer This disgrace; if so, we are not sovereigns Of the sea; our right, that Heaven gave To England, when at the birth of nature She was seated in the deep, the Ocean ceas'd His mighty roar; and, fawning, play'd around Her snowy feet, and own'd his awful Queen. Lord Percy, if the heart is sick, the head Must be aggriev'd; if but one member suffer, The heart doth fail. You say, my Lord, the merchants Can, if they will, defend themselves against These rovers: this is a noble scheme, Worthy the brave Lord Percy, and as worthy His generous aid to put it into practice. Percy. Lord Bishop, what was rash in me, is wise In you; I dare not own the plan. 'Tis not Mine. Yet will I, if you please, Quickly to the Lord Mayor, and work him onward To this most glorious voyage, on which cast I'll set my whole estate. But we will bring these Gallic rovers under. Queen Phil. Thanks, brave Lord Percy; you have the thanks Of England's Queen, and will, ere long, of England. [Exeunt. SCENE [3] At Cressey. Sir Thomas Dagworth and Lord Audley, meeting. Aud. Good morrow, brave Sir Thomas; the bright morn Smiles on our army, and the gallant sun Springs from the hills like a young hero Into the battle, shaking his golden locks Exultingly; this is a promising day. Dagw. Why, my Lord Audley, I don't know. Give me your hand, and now I'll tell you what I think you do not know—Edward's afraid of Philip. Aud. Ha, Ha, Sir Thomas! you but joke; Did you eer see him fear? At Blanchetaque, When almost singly he drove six thousand French from the ford, did he fear then? Dagw. Yes, fear; that made him fight so. Aud By the same reason I might say, 'tis fear That makes you fight. Dagw. Mayhap you may; look upon Edward's face— No one can say he fears. But when he turns His back, then I will say it to his face, He is afraid; he makes us all afraid. I cannot bear the enemy at my back. Now here we are at Cressy; where, to-morrow, To-morrow we shall know. I say, Lord Audley, That Edward runs away from Philip. Aud. Perhaps you think the Prince too is afraid? Dagw. No; God forbid! I'm sure he is not— He is a young lion. O I have seen him fight, And give command, and lightning has flashed From his eyes across the field; I have seen him Shake hands with death, and strike a bargain for The enemy; he has danc'd in the field Of battle, like the youth at morrice play. I'm sure he's not afraid, nor Warwick, nor none, None of us but me; and I am very much afraid. Aud. Are you afraid too, Sir Thomas? I believe that as much as I believe The King's afraid; but what are you afraid of? Dagw. Of having my back laid open; we turn Our backs to the fire, till we shall burn our skirts. Aud. And this, Sir Thomas, you call fear? Your fear Is of a different kind then from the King's; He fears to turn his face, and you to turn your back.— I do not think, Sir Thomas, you know what fear is. Enter Sir John Chandos. Chand. Good morrow, Generals; I give you joy: Welcome to the fields of Cressy. Here we stop, And wait for Philip. Dagw. I hope so. Aud. There, Sir Thomas; do you call that fear? Dagw. I don't know; perhaps he takes it by fits. Why, noble Chandos, look you here— One rotten sheep spoils the whole flock; And if the bell-weather is tainted, I wish The Prince may not catch the distemper too. Chand. Distemper, Sir Thomas! what distemper? I have not heard. Dagw. Why, Chandos, you are a wise man, I know you understand me; a distemper The King caught here in France of running away. Aud. Sir Thomas, you say, you have caught it too. Dag. And so will the whole army; 'tis very catching, For when the coward runs, the brave man totters. Perhaps the air of the country is the cause.— I feel it coming upon me, so I strive against it; You yet are whole, but after a few more Retreats, we all shall know how to retreat Better than fight.—To be plain, I think retreating Too often, takes away a soldier's courage. Chand. Here comes the King himself; tell him your thoughts Plainly, Sir Thomas. Dagw. I've told him before, but his disorder Makes him deaf. Enter King Edward and Black Prince. King. Good morrow, Generals; when English courage fails, Down goes our right to France; But we are conquerors every where; nothing Can stand our soldiers; each man is worthy Of a triumph. Such an army of heroes Ne'er shouted to the Heav'ns, nor shook the field. Edward, my son, thou art Most happy, having such command; the man Were base who were not fir'd to deeds Above heroic, having such examples. Prince. Sire! with respect and deference I look Upon such noble souls, and wish myself Worthy the high command that Heaven and you Have given me. When I have seen the field glow, And in each countenance the soul of war Curb'd by the manliest reason, I have been wing'd With certain victory; and 'tis my boast, And shall be still my glory. I was inspir'd By these brave troops. Dagw. Your Grace had better make Them all Generals. King. Sir Thomas Dagworth, you must have your joke, And shall, while you can fight as you did at The Ford. Dagw. I have a small petition to your Majesty. King. What can Sir Thomas Dagworth ask, that Edward Can refuse? Dagw. I hope your Majesty cannot refuse so great A trifle; I've gilt your cause with my best blood, And would again, were I not forbid By him whom I am bound to obey: my hands Are tied up, my courage shrunk and wither'd, My sinews slacken'd, and my voice scarce heard; Therefore I beg I may return to England. King. I know not what you could have ask'd, Sir Thomas, That I would not have sooner parted with Than such a soldier as you have been, and such a friend; Nay, I will know the most remote particulars Of this your strange petition; that, if I can, I still may keep you here. Dagw. Here on the fields of Cressy we are settled, 'Till Philip springs the tim'rous covey again. The Wolf is hunted down by causeless fear; The Lion flees, and fear usurps his heart; Startled, astonish'd at the clam'rous Cock; The Eagle, that doth gaze upon the sun, Fears the small fire that plays about the fen; If, at this moment of their idle fear, The Dog doth seize the Wolf, the Forester the Lion, The Negro in the crevice of the rock, Doth seize the soaring Eagle; undone by flight, They tame submit: such the effect flight has On noble souls. Now hear its opposite: The tim'rous Stag starts from the thicket wild, The fearful Crane springs from the splashy fen, The shining Snake glides o'er the bending grass, The Stag turns head! and bays the crying Hounds; The Crane o'ertaken, sighteth with the Hawk; The Snake doth turn, and bite the padding foot; And, if your Majesty's afraid of Philip, You are more like a Lion than a Crane: Therefore I beg I may return to England. King. Sir Thomas, now I understand your mirth, Which often plays with Wisdom for its pastime, And brings good counsel from the breast of laughter, I hope you'll stay, and see us fight this battle, And reap rich harvest in the fields of Cressy; Then go to England, tell them how we fight, And set all hearts on fire to be with us. Philip is plum'd, and thinks we flee from him, Else he would never dare to attack us. Now, Now the quarry's set! and Death doth sport In the bright sunshine of this fatal day. Dagw. Now my heart dances, and I am as light As the young bridegroom going to be married. Now must I to my soldiers, get them ready, Furbish our armours bright, new plume our helms, And we will sing, like the young housewives busied In the dairy; my feet are wing'd, but not For flight, an please your grace. King. If all my soldiers are as pleas'd as you, 'Twill be a gallant thing to fight or die; Then I can never be afraid of Philip. Dagw. A raw-bon'd fellow t'other day pass'd by me; I told him to put off his hungry looks— He answer'd me, “I hunger for another battle.” I saw a little Welchman with a fiery face; I told him he look'd like a candle half Burn'd out; he answer'd, he was “pig enough “To light another pattle.” Last night, beneath The moon I walk'd abroad, when all had pitch'd Their tents, and all were still, I heard a blooming youth singing a song He had compos'd, and at each pause he wip'd His dropping eyes. The ditty was, “if he “Return'd victorious, he should wed a maiden “Fairer than snow, and rich as midsummer.” Another wept, and wish'd health to his father. I chid them both, but gave them noble hopes. These are the minds that glory in the battle, And leap and dance to hear the trumpet sound. King. Sir Thomas Dagworth, be thou near our person; Thy heart is richer than the vales of France: I will not part with such a man as thee. If Philip came arm'd in the ribs of death, And shook his mortal dart against my head, Thoud'st laugh his fury into nerveless shame! Go now, for thou art suited to the work, Throughout the camp; enflame the timorous, Blow up the sluggish into ardour, and Confirm the strong with strength, the weak inspire, And wing their brows with hope and expectation: Then to our tent return, and meet to council. [Exit Dagworth. Chand. That man's a hero in his closet, and more A hero to the servants of his house Than to the gaping world; he carries windows In that enlarged breast of his, that all May see what's done within. Prince. He is a genuine Englishman, my Chandos, And hath the spirit of Liberty within him. Forgive my prejudice, Sir John; I think My Englishmen the bravest people on The face of the earth. Chand. Courage, my Lord, proceeds from self-dependence; Teach man to think he's a free agent, Give but a slave his liberty, he'll shake Off sloth, and build himself a hut, and hedge A spot of ground; this he'll defend; 'tis his By right of nature: thus set in action, He will still move onward to plan conveniences, 'Till glory fires his breast to enlarge his castle, While the poor slave drudges all day, in hope To rest at night. King. O Liberty, how glorious art thou! I see thee hov'ring o'er my army, with Thy wide-stretch'd plumes; I see thee Lead them on to battle; I see thee blow thy golden trumpet, while Thy sons shout the strong shout of victory! O noble Chandos! think thyself a gardener, My son a vine, which I commit unto Thy care; prune all extravagant shoots, and guide Th'ambitious tendrils in the paths of wisdom; Water him with thy advice, and Heav'n Rain fresh'ning dew upon his branches. And, O Edward, my dear son! learn to think lowly of Thyself, as we may all each prefer other— 'Tis the best policy, and 'tis our duty. [Exit King Edward. Prince. And may our duty, Chandos, be our pleasure— Now we are alone, Sir John, I will unburden, And breathe my hopes into the burning air, Where thousand deaths are posting up and down, Commission'd to this fatal field of Cressy; Methinks I see them arm my gallant soldiers, And gird the sword upon each thigh, and fit Each shining helm, and string each stubborn bow, And dance to the neighing of our steeds. Methinks the shout begins, the battle burns; Methinks I see them perch on English crests, And roar the wild flame of fierce war, upon The thronged enemy! In truth, I am too full; It is my sin to love the noise of war. Chandos, thou seest my weakness; strong nature Will bend or break us; my blood, like a springtide, Does rise so high, to overflow all bounds Of moderation; while Reason, in his Frail bark, can see no shore or bound for vast Ambition. Come, take the helm, my Chandos, That my full-blown sails overset me not In the wild tempest; condemn my 'ventrous youth, That plays with danger, as the innocent child, Unthinking, plays upon the viper's den: I am a coward, in my reason, Chandos. Chand. You are a man, my prince, and a brave man, If I can judge of actions; but your heat Is the effect of youth, and want of use; Use makes the armed field and noisy war Pass over as a summer cloud, unregarded, Or but expected as a thing of course. Age is contemplative; each rolling year Brings forth fruit to the mind's treasure-house; While vacant youth doth crave and seek about Within itself, and findeth discontent: Then, tir'd of thought, impatient takes the wing, Seizes the fruits of time, attacks experience, Roams round vast Nature's forest, where no bounds Are set, the swiftest may have room, the strongest Find prey; till tir'd at length, sated and tired With the changing sameness, old variety, We sit us down, and view our former joys With distaste and dislike. Prince. Then if we must tug for experience, Let us not fear to beat round Nature's wilds, And rouze the strongest prey; then if we fall, We fall with glory; I know the wolf Is dangerous to fight, not good for food, Nor is the hide a comely vestment; so We have our battle for our pains. I know That youth has need of age to point fit prey, And oft the stander-by shall steal the fruit Of th'other's labour. This is philosophy; These are the tricks of the world; but the pure soul Shall mount on native wings, disdaining Little sport, and cut a path into the heaven of glory, Leaving a track of light for men to wonder at. I'm glad my father does not hear me talk; You can find friendly excuses for me, Chandos; But do you not think, Sir John, that if it please Th'Almighty to stretch out my span of life, I shall with pleasure view a glorious action, Which my youth master'd. Chand. Considerate age, my Lord, views motives, And not acts; when neither warbling voice, Nor trilling pipe is heard, nor pleasure sits With trembling age; the voice of Conscience then, Sweeter than music in a summer's eve, Shall warble round the snowy head, and keep Sweet symphony to feather'd angels, sitting As guardians round your chair; then shall the pulse Beat slow, and taste, and touch, and sight, and sound, and smell, That sing and dance round Reason's fine-wrought throne, Shall flee away, and leave him all forlorn; Yet not forlorn if Conscience is his friend. [Exeunt. SCENE [4] in Sir Thomas Dagworth's Tent. Dagworth and William his Man. Dagw. Bring hither my armour, William; Ambition is the growth of ev'ry clime. Will. Does it grow in England, Sir? Dagw. Aye, it grows most in lands most cultivated. Will. Then it grows most in France; the vines here Are finer than any we have in England. Dagw. Aye, but the oaks are not. Will. What is the tree you mentioned? I don't think I ever saw it. Dagw. Ambition. Will. Is it a little creeping root that grows in ditches? Dagw. Thou dost not understand me, William. It is a root that grows in every breast; Ambition is the desire or passion that one man Has to get before another, in any pursuit after glory; But I don't think you have any of it. Will. Yes, I have; I have a great ambition to know every thing, Sir. Dagw. But when our first ideas are wrong, what follows must all be wrong of course; 'tis best to know a little, and to know that little aright. Will. Then, Sir, I should be glad to know if it was not ambition that brought over our King to France to fight for his right? Dagw. Tho' the knowledge of that will not profit thee much, yet I will tell you that it was ambition. Will. Then if ambition is a sin, we are all guilty in coming with him, and in fighting for him. Dagw. Now, William, thou dost thrust the question home; but I must tell you, that guilt being an act of the mind, none are guilty but those whose minds are prompted by that same ambition. Will. Now I always thought, that a man might be guilty of doing wrong, without knowing it was wrong. Dagw. Thou art a natural philosopher, and knowest truth by instinct; while reason runs aground, as we have run our argument. Only remember, William, all have it in their power to know the motives of their own actions, and 'tis a sin to act without some reason. Will. And whoever acts without reason, may do a great deal of harm without knowing it. Dagw. Thou art an endless moralist. Will. Now there's a story come into my head, that I will tell your honour, if you'll give me leave. Dagw. No, William, save it till another time; this is no time for storytelling; but here comes one who is as entertaining as a good story. Enter Peter Blunt. Peter. Yonder's a musician going to play before the King; it's a new song about the French and English, and the Prince has made the minstrel a 'squire, and given him I don't know what, and I can't tell whether he don't mention us all one by one; and he is to write another about all us that are to die, that we may be remembered in Old England, for all our blood and bones are in France; and a great deal more that we shall all hear by and by; and I came to tell your honour, because you love to hear war-songs. Dagw. And who is this minstrel, Peter, do'st know? Peter. O aye, I forgot to tell that; he has got the same name as Sir John Chandos, that the prince is always with—the wise man, that knows us all as well as your honour, only e'nt so good natur'd. Dagw. I thank you, Peter, for your information, but not for your compliment, which is not true; there's as much difference between him and me, as between glittering sand and fruitful mold; or shining glass and a wrought diamond, set in rich gold, and fitted to the finger of an emperor: such is that worthy Chandos. Peter. I know your honour does not think any thing of yourself, but every body else does. Dagw. Go, Peter, get you gone; flattery is delicious, even from the lips of a babbler. [Exit Peter. Will. I never flatter your honour. Dagw. I don't know that. Will. Why you know, Sir, when we were in England, at the tournament at Windsor, and the Earl of Warwick was tumbled over, you ask'd me if he did not look well when he fell? and I said, No, he look'd very foolish; and you was very angry with me for not flattering you. Dagw. You mean that I was angry with you for not flattering the Earl of Warwick. [Exeunt. SCENE [5] Sir Thomas Dagworth's Tent. Sir Thomas Dagworth—to him. Enter Sir Walter Manny. Sir Walter. Sir Thomas Dagworth, I have been weeping Over the men that are to die to-day. Dagw. Why, brave Sir Walter, you or I may fall. Sir Walter. I know this breathing flesh must lie and rot, Cover'd with silence and forgetfulness.— Death wons in cities' smoke, and in still night, When men sleep in their beds, walketh about! How many in walled cities lie and groan, Turning themselves upon their beds, Talking with death, answering his hard demands! How many walk in darkness, terrors are round The curtains of their beds, destruction is Ready at the door! How many sleep In earth, cover'd with stones and deathy dust, Resting in quietness, whose spirits walk Upon the clouds of heaven, to die no more! Yet death is terrible, tho' borne on angels' wings! How terrible then is the field of death, Where he doth rend the vault of heaven, And shake the gates of hell! O Dagworth, France is sick! the very sky, Tho' sunshine light it, seems to me as pale As the pale fainting man on his death-bed, Whose face is shewn by light of sickly taper! It makes me sad and sick at very heart, Thousands must fall to-day! Dagw. Thousands of souls must leave this prison house, To be exalted to those heavenly fields, Where songs of triumph, palms of victory, Where peace, and joy, and love, and calm content, Sit singing in the azure clouds, and strew Flowers of heaven's growth over the banquet-table: Bind ardent Hope upon your feet like shoes, Put on the robe of preparation, The table is prepar'd in shining heaven, The flowers of immortality are blown; Let those that fight, fight in good stedfastness, And those that fall shall rise in victory. Sir Walter. I've often seen the burning field of war, And often heard the dismal clang of arms; But never, till this fatal day of Cressy, Has my soul fainted with these views of death! I seem to be in one great charnel-house, And seem to scent the rotten carcases! I seem to hear the dismal yells of death, While the black gore drops from his horrid jaws: Yet I not fear the monster in his pride.— But O the souls that are to die to-day! Dagw. Stop, brave Sir Walter; let me drop a tear, Then let the clarion of war begin; I'll fight and weep, 'tis in my country's cause; I'll weep and shout for glorious liberty. Grim war shall laugh and shout, decked in tears, And blood shall flow like streams across the meadows, That murmur down their pebbly channels, and Spend their sweet lives to do their country service: Then shall England's verdure shoot, her fields shall smile, Her ships shall sing across the foaming sea, Her mariners shall use the flute and viol, And rattling guns, and black and dreary war, Shall be no more. Sir Walter. Well; let the trumpet sound, and the drum beat; Let war stain the blue heavens with bloody banners, I'll draw my sword, nor ever sheath it up, 'Till England blow the trump of victory, Or I lay stretch'd upon the field of death! Exeunt. SCENE [6] in the Camp. Several of the Warriors met at the King's Tent with a Minstrel, who sings the following Song: O sons of Trojan Brutus, cloath'd in war, Whose voices are the thunder of the field, Rolling dark clouds o'er France, muffling the sun In sickly darkness like a dim eclipse, Threatening as the red brow of storms, as fire Burning up nations in your wrath and fury! Your ancestors came from the fires of Troy, (Like lions rouz'd by light'ning from their dens, Whose eyes do glare against the stormy fires) Heated with war, fill'd with the blood of Greeks, With helmets hewn, and shields covered with gore, In navies black, broken with wind and tide! They landed in firm array upon the rocks Of Albion; they kiss'd the rocky shore; “Be thou our mother, and our nurse,” they said; “Our children's mother, and thou shalt be our grave; “The sepulchre of ancient Troy, from whence “Shall rise cities, and thrones, and arms, and awful pow'rs. Our fathers swarm from the ships. Giant voices Are heard from the hills, the enormous sons Of Ocean run from rocks and caves: wild men, Naked and roaring like lions, hurling rocks, And wielding knotty clubs, like oaks entangled Thick as a forest, ready for the axe. Our fathers move in firm array to battle, The savage monsters rush like roaring fire; Like as a forest roars with crackling flames, When the red lightning, borne by furious storms, Lights on some woody shore; the parched heavens Rain fire into the molten raging sea! The smoaking trees are strewn upon the shore, Spoil'd of their verdure! O how oft have they Defy'd the storm that howled o'er their heads! Our fathers, sweating, lean on their spears, and view The mighty dead: giant bodies, streaming blood, Dread visages, frowning in silent death! Then Brutus spoke, inspir'd; our fathers sit Attentive on the melancholy shore:— Hear ye the voice of Brutus—“The flowing waves “Of time come rolling o'er my breast,” he said; “And my heart labours with futurity: “Our sons shall rule the empire of the sea. “Their mighty wings shall stretch from east to west, “Their nest is in the sea; but they shall roam “Like eagles for the prey; nor shall the young “Crave or be heard; for plenty shall bring forth, “Cities shall sing, and vales in rich array “Shall laugh, whose fruitful laps bend down with fulness. “Our sons shall rise from thrones in joy, “Each one buckling on his armour; Morning “Shall be prevented by their swords gleaming, “And Evening hear their song of victory! “Their towers shall be built upon the rocks, “Their daughters shall sing, surrounded with shining spears! “Liberty shall stand upon the cliffs of Albion, “Casting her blue eyes over the green ocean; “Or, tow'ring, stand upon the roaring waves, “Stretching her mighty spear o'er distant lands; “While, with her eagle wings, she covereth “Fair Albion's shore, and all her families.” PROLOGUE, INTENDED FOR A DRAMATIC PIECE OF KING EDWARD THE FOURTH. O For a voice like thunder, and a tongue To drown the throat of war!—When the senses Are shaken, and the soul is driven to madness, Who can stand? When the souls of the oppressed Fight in the troubled air that rages, who can stand? When the whirlwind of fury comes from the Throne of God, when the frowns of his countenance Drive the nations together, who can stand? When Sin claps his broad wings over the battle, And sails rejoicing in the flood of Death; When souls are torn to everlasting fire, And fiends of Hell rejoice upon the slain, O who can stand? O who hath caused this? O who can answer at the throne of God? The Kings and Nobles of the Land have done it! Hear it not, Heaven, thy Ministers have done it! A WAR SONG TO ENGLISHMEN. Prepare, prepare, the iron helm of war, Bring forth the lots, cast in the spacious orb; Th'Angel of Fate turns them with mighty hands, And casts them out upon the darken'd earth! Prepare, prepare. Prepare your hearts for Death's cold hand! prepare Your souls for flight, your bodies for the earth! Prepare your arms for glorious victory! Prepare your eyes to meet a holy God! Prepare, prepare. Whose fatal scroll is that? Methinks 'tis mine! Why sinks my heart, why faultereth my tongue? Had I three lives, I'd die in such a cause, And rise, with ghosts, over the well-fought field. Prepare, prepare. The arrows of Almighty God are drawn! Angels of Death stand in the low'ring heavens! Thousands of souls must seek the realms of light, And walk together on the clouds of heaven! Prepare, prepare. Soldiers, prepare! Our cause is Heaven's cause; Soldiers, prepare! Be worthy of our cause: Prepare to meet our fathers in the sky: Prepare, O troops, that are to fall to-day! Prepare, prepare. Alfred shall smile, and make his harp rejoice; The Norman William, and the learned Clerk, And Lion Heart, and black-brow'd Edward, with His loyal queen shall rise, and welcome us! Prepare, prepare.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">V [SONGS AND BALLADS] [Written in a copy of Poetical Sketches] SONG 1st BY A SHEPHERD Welcome, stranger, to this place, Where joy doth sit on every bough, Paleness flies from every face; We reap not what we do not sow. Innocence doth like a rose Bloom on every maiden's cheek; Honour twines around her brows, The jewel health adorns her neck. SONG BY AN OLD SHEPHERD When silver snow decks Sylvio's clothes And jewel hangs at shepherd's nose, We can abide life's pelting storm That makes our limbs quake, if our hearts be warm. Whilst Virtue is our walking-staff And Truth a lantern to our path, We can abide life's pelting storm That makes our limbs quake, if our hearts be warm. Blow, boisterous wind, stern winter frown, Innocence is a winter's gown; So clad, we'll abide life's pelting storm That makes our limbs quake, if our hearts be warm.

Ann Flaxman A little Flower grew in a lonely Vale Its form was lovely but its colours. pale One standing in the Porches of the Sun When his Meridian Glories were begun Leapd from the steps of fire &amp; on the grass Alighted where this little flower was With hands divine he movd the gentle Sod And took the Flower up in its native Clod Then planting it upon a Mountains brow 'Tis your own fault if you dont flourish now William Blake [The Pickering Manuscript] The Smile There is a Smile of Love And there is a Smile of Deceit And there is a Smile of Smiles In which these two Smiles meet And there is a Frown of Hate And there is a Frown of disdain And there is a Frown of Frowns Which you strive to forget in vain For it sticks in the Hearts deep Core And it sticks in the deep Back bone And no Smile that ever was smild But only one Smile alone That betwixt the Cradle &amp; Grave It only once Smild can be But when it once is Smild Theres an end to all Misery The Golden Net Three Virgins at the break of day Whither young Man whither away Alas for woe! alas for woe! They cry &amp; tears for ever flow The one was Clothd in flames of fire The other Clothd in iron wire The other Clothd in tears &amp; sighs Dazling bright before my Eyes They bore a Net of Golden twine To hang upon the Branches fine Pitying I wept to see the woe That Love &amp; Beauty undergo To be consumd in burning Fires And in ungratified desires And in tears clothd Night &amp; day Melted all my Soul away When they saw my Tears a Smile That did Heaven itself beguile Bore the Golden Net aloft As on downy Pinions soft Over the Morning of my day Underneath the Net I stray Now intreating Burning Fire Now intreating Iron Wire Now intreating Tears &amp; Sighs O when will the morning rise The Mental Traveller I traveld thro' a Land of Men A Land of Men &amp; Women too And heard &amp; saw such dreadful things As cold Earth wanderers never knew For there the Babe is born in joy That was begotten in dire woe Just as we Reap in joy the fruit Which we in bitter tears did sow And if the Babe is born a Boy He's given to a Woman Old Who nails him down upon a rock Catches his shrieks in cups of gold She binds iron thorns around his head She pierces both his hands &amp; feet She cuts his heart out at his side To make it feel both cold &amp; heat Her fingers number every Nerve Just as a Miser counts his gold She lives upon his shrieks &amp; cries And she grows young as he grows old Till he becomes a bleeding youth And she becomes a Virgin bright Then he rends up his Manacles And binds her down for his delight He plants himself in all her Nerves Just as a Husbandman his mould And she becomes his dwelling place And Garden fruitful seventy fold An aged Shadow soon he fades Wandring round an Earthly Cot Full filled all with gems &amp; gold Which he by industry had got And these are the gems of the Human Soul The rubies &amp; pearls of a lovesick eye The countless gold of the akeing heart The martyrs groan &amp; the lovers sigh They are his meat they are his drink He feeds the Beggar &amp; the Poor And the wayfaring Traveller For ever open is his door His grief is their eternal joy They make the roofs &amp; walls to ring Till from the fire on the hearth A little Female Babe does spring And she is all of solid fire And gems &amp; gold that none his hand Dares stretch to touch her Baby form Or wrap her in his swaddling-band But She comes to the Man she loves If young or old or rich or poor They soon drive out the aged Host A Beggar at anothers door He wanders weeping far away Untill some other take him in Oft blind &amp; age-bent sore distrest Untill he can a Maiden win And to allay his freezing Age The Poor Man takes her in his arms The Cottage fades before his sight The Garden &amp; its lovely Charms The Guests are scatterd thro' the land For the Eye altering alters all The Senses roll themselves in fear And the flat Earth becomes a Ball The Stars Sun Moon all shrink away A desart vast without a bound And nothing left to eat or drink And a dark desart all around The honey of her Infant lips The bread &amp; wine of her sweet smile The wild game of her roving Eye Does him to Infancy beguile For as he eats &amp; drinks he grows Younger &amp; younger every day And on the desart wild they both Wander in terror &amp; dismay Like the wild Stag she flees away Her fear plants many a thicket wild While he pursues her night &amp; day By various arts of Love beguild By various arts of Love &amp; Hate Till the wide desart planted oer With Labyrinths of wayward Love Where roams the Lion Wolf &amp; Boar Till he becomes a wayward Babe And she a weeping Woman Old Then many a Lover wanders here The Sun &amp; Stars are nearer rolld The trees bring forth sweet Extacy To all who in the desart roam Till many a City there is Built And many a pleasant Shepherds home But when they find the frowning Babe Terror strikes thro the region wide They cry the Babe the Babe is Born And flee away on Every side For who dare touch the frowning form His arm is witherd to its root Lions Boars Wolves all howling flee And every Tree does shed its fruit And none can touch that frowning form Except it be a Woman Old She nails him down upon the Rock And all is done as I have told The Land of Dreams Awake awake my little Boy Thou wast thy Mothers only joy Why dost thou weep in thy gentle sleep Awake thy Father does thee keep O what Land is the Land of Dreams What are its Mountains &amp; what are its Streams O Father I saw my Mother there Among the Lillies by waters fair Among the Lambs clothed in white She walkd with her Thomas in sweet delight I wept for joy like a dove I mourn O when shall I again return Dear Child I also by pleasant Streams Have wanderd all Night in the Land of Dreams But tho calm &amp; warm the waters wide I could not get to the other side Father O Father what do we here In this Land of unbelief &amp; fear The Land of Dreams is better far Above the light of the Morning Star Mary Sweet Mary the first time she ever was there Came into the Ball room among the Fair The young Men &amp; Maidens around her throng And these are the words upon every tongue An Angel is here from the heavenly Climes Or again does return the Golden times Her eyes outshine every brilliant ray She opens her lips tis the Month of May Mary moves in soft beauty &amp; conscious delight To augment with sweet smiles all the joys of the Night Nor once blushes to own to the rest of the Fair That sweet Love &amp; Beauty are worthy our care In the Morning the Villagers rose with delight And repeated with pleasure the joys of the night And Mary arose among Friends to be free But no Friend from henceforward thou Mary shalt see Some said she was proud some calld her a whore And some when she passed by shut to the door A damp cold came oer her her blushes all fled Her lillies &amp; roses are blighted &amp; shed O why was I born with a different Face Why was I not born like this Envious Race Why did Heaven adorn me with bountiful hand And then set me down in an envious Land To be weak as a Lamb &amp; smooth as a dove And not to raise Envy is calld Christian Love But if you raise Envy your Merits to blame For planting such spite in the weak &amp; the tame I will humble my Beauty I will not dress fine I will keep from the Ball &amp; my Eyes shall not shine And if any Girls Lover forsakes her for me I'll refuse him my hand &amp; from Envy be free She went out in Morning attird plain &amp; neat Proud Marys gone Mad said the Child in the Street She went out in Morning in plain neat attire And came home in Evening bespatterd with mire She trembled &amp; wept sitting on the Bed side She forgot it was Night &amp; she trembled &amp; cried She forgot it was Night she forgot it was Morn Her soft Memory imprinted with Faces of Scorn With Faces of Scorn &amp; with Eyes of disdain Like foul Fiends inhabiting Marys mild Brain She remembers no Face like the Human Divine All Faces have Envy sweet Mary but thine And thine is a Face of sweet Love in Despair And thine is a Face of mild sorrow &amp; care And thine is a Face of wild terror &amp; fear That shall never be quiet till laid on its bier The Crystal Cabinet The Maiden caught me in the Wild Where I was dancing merrily She put me into her Cabinet And Lockd me up with a golden Key This Cabinet is formd of Gold And Pearl &amp; Crystal shining bright And within it opens into a World And a little lovely Moony Night Another England there I saw Another London with its Tower Another Thames &amp; other Hills And another pleasant Surrey Bower Another Maiden like herself Translucent lovely shining clear Threefold each in the other closd O what a pleasant trembling fear O what a smile a threefold Smile Filld me that like a flame I burnd I bent to Kiss the lovely Maid And found a Threefold Kiss returnd I strove to sieze the inmost Form With ardor fierce &amp;

feet were wounded wide His Body bent his arms &amp; knees Like to the roots of ancient trees His eye was dry no tear could flow A hollow groan first spoke his woe He trembled &amp; shudderd upon the Bed At length with a feeble cry he said When God commanded this hand to write In the studious hours of deep midnight He told me the writing I wrote should prove The Bane of all that on Earth I lovd My Brother starvd between two Walls His Childrens Cry my Soul appalls I mockd at the wrack &amp;

      <field name="fulltext">XV [LETTERS, A SELECTION] To My Dearest Friend, John Flaxman, these lines I bless thee, O Father of Heaven &amp; Earth, that ever I saw Flaxman's face. Angels stand round my Spirit in Heaven, the blessed of Heaven are my friends upon Earth. When Flaxman was taken to Italy, Fuseli was given to me for a season, And now Flaxman hath given me Hayley his friend to be mine, such my lot upon Earth. Now my lot in the Heavens is this, Milton lov'd me in childhood &amp; shew'd me his face. Ezra came with Isaiah the Prophet, but Shakespeare in riper years gave me his hand; Paracelsus &amp; Behmen appear'd to me, terrors appear'd in the Heavens above And in Hell beneath, &amp; a mighty &amp; awful change threatened the Earth. The American War began. All its dark horrors passed before my face Across the Atlantic to France. Then the French Revolution commenc'd in thick clouds, And My Angels have told me that seeing such visions I could not subsist on the Earth, But by my conjunction with Flaxman, who knows to forgive Nervous Fear.

Butts, Great Marlborough Street, Oxford Street, London Felpham Jan? 10. 1802 I hear a voice you cannot hear that says I must not stay I see a hand you cannot see that beckons me away [To Thomas Butts, 22 November 1802] With happiness stretchd across the hills In a cloud that dewy sweetness distills With a blue sky spread over with wings And a mild sun that mounts &amp; sings With trees &amp; fields full of Fairy elves And little devils who fight for themselves Remembring the Verses that Hayley sung When my heart knockd against the root of my tongue With Angels planted in Hawthorn bowers And God himself in the passing hours With Silver Angels across my way And Golden Demons that none can stay With my Father hovering upon the wind And my Brother Robert just behind And my Brother John the evil one In a black cloud making his mone Tho dead they appear upon my path Notwithstanding my terrible wrath They beg they intreat they drop their tears Filld full of hopes filld full of fears With a thousand Angels upon the Wind Pouring disconsolate from behind To drive them off &amp; before my way A frowning Thistle implores my stay What to others a trifle appears Fills me full of smiles or tears For double the vision my Eyes do see And a double vision is always with me With my inward Eye 'tis an old Man grey With my outward a Thistle across my way “If thou goest back the thistle said Thou art to endless woe betrayd For here does Theotormon lower And here is Enitharmons bower And Los the terrible thus hath sworn Because thou backward dost return Poverty Envy old age &amp; fear Shall bring thy Wife upon a bier And Butts shall give what Fuseli gave A dark black Rock &amp; a gloomy Cave.” I struck the Thistle with my foot And broke him up from his delving root “Must the duties of life each other cross” “Must every joy be dung &amp; dross” ‘Must my dear Butts feel cold neglect” “Because I give Hayley his due respect’ “Must Flaxman look upon me as wild” “And all my friends be with doubts beguild’ “Must my Wife live in my Sisters bane” “Or my sister survive on my Loves pain’ “The curses of Los the terrible shade” “And his dismal terrors make me afraid” So I spoke &amp; struck in my wrath The old man weltering upon my path Then Los appeard in all his power In the Sun he appeard descending before My face in fierce flames in my double sight Twas outward a Sun: inward Los in his might “My hands are labourd day &amp; night” “And Ease comes never in my sight” “My Wife has no indulgence given” “Except what comes to her from heaven” “We eat little we drink less” “This Earth breeds not our happiness” “Another Sun feeds our lifes streams” “We are not warmed with thy beams” “Thou measurest not the Time to me” “Nor yet the Space that I do see” “My Mind is not with thy light arrayd” “Thy terrors shall not make me afraid” When I had my Defiance given The Sun stood trembling in heaven The Moon that glowd remote below Became leprous &amp; white as snow And every Soul of men on the Earth Felt affliction &amp; sorrow &amp; sickness &amp; dearth Los flamd in my path &amp; the Sun was hot With the bows of my Mind &amp; the Arrows of Thought My bowstring fierce with Ardour breathes My arrows glow in their golden sheaves My brothers &amp; father march before The heavens drop with human gore Now I a fourfold vision see And a fourfold vision is given to me Tis fourfold in my supreme delight And three fold in soft Beulahs night And twofold Always.
