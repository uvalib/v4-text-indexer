      <field name="fulltext">FORMAL SATIRES THE ELEPHANT IN THE MOONSquare brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations A learn'd Society of late, The Glory of a foreign State, Agreed, upon a Summer's Night, To search the Moon by her own Light; To take an Invent'ry of all Her real Estate, and personal; And make an accurate Survey Of all her Lands, and how they lay, As true as that of Ireland, where The sly Surveyors stole a Shire; T' observe her Country, how 'twas planted, With what sh' abounded most, or wanted; And make the proper'st Observations, For settling of new Plantations, If the Society should incline T' attempt so glorious a Design. This was the Purpose of their meeting, For which they chose a Time as fitting; When, at the Full, her radiant Light And Influence too were at their Height. And now the lofty Tube, the Scale With which they Heav'n itself assail, Was mounted full against the Moon; And all stood ready to fall on, Impatient who should have the Honour To plant an Ensign first upon her. When one, who for his deep Belief Was Virtuoso then in chief, Approv'd the most profound, and wise To solve Impossibilities, Advancing gravely, to apply To th' optick glass his judging Eye, Cry'd—Strange!—then reinforc'd his Sight Against the Moon with all his Might, And bent his penetrating Brow, As if he meant to gaze her through. When all the rest began t' admire, And, like a Train, from him took Fire, Surpriz'd with Wonder, beforehand, At what they did not understand, Cry'd out, impatient to know what The Matter was, they wonder'd at. Quoth he,—Th' Inhabitants o' th' Moon, Who, when the Sun shines hot at Noon, Do live in Cellars underground Of eight Miles deep, and eighty round, (In which at once they fortify Against the Sun, and th' Enemy) Which they count Towns and Cities there, Because their People's civiler Than those rude Peasants, that are found To live upon the upper Ground, Call'd Privolvans, with whom they are Perpetually in open War; And now both Armies, highly 'nrag'd; Are in a bloody Fight engag'd; And many fall on both Sides slain, As by the Glass 'tis clear, and plain. Look quickly then, that every one May see the Fight, before 'tis done. With that a great Philosopher, Admir'd, and famous far and near, As one of singular Invention, But universal Comprehension, Apply'd one Eye, and half a Nose Unto the optick Engine close. For he had lately undertook To prove, and publish in a Book, That Men, whose nat'ral Eyes are out, May, by more pow'rful Art, be brought To see with th' empty Holes as plain, As if their Eyes were in again: And, if they chanc'd to fail of those, To make an Optick of a Nose; As clearly it may, by those that wear But Spectacles, be made appear; By which both Senses being united Does render them much better sighted. This great Man, having fix'd both Sights To view the formidable Fights, Observ'd his best, and then cry'd out,— The Battle's desperately fought: The gallant Subvolvani rally, And from their Trenches make a Sally Upon the stubborn Enemy, Who now begin to rout and fly. These silly ranting Privolvans, Have every Summer their Campains, And muster, like the warlike Sons Of Raw-head and of Bloody-bones, As numerous as Soland Geese I' th' Islands of the Orcades, Couragiously to make a Stand, And face their Neighbours Hand to Hand; Until the long'd-for Winter's come, And then return in Triumph home, And spend the rest o' th' Year in Lies, And vapouring of their Victories. From th' old Arcadians th' are believ'd To be, before the Moon, deriv'd; And when her Orb was new created, To people her, were thence translated. For, as th' Arcadians were reputed Of all the Grecians the most stupid, Whom nothing in the World could bring To civil Life, but fiddling, They still retain the antique Course, And Custom of their Ancestors; And always sing, and fiddle to Things of the greatest Weight they do. While thus the learn'd Man entertains Th' Assembly with the Privolvans; Another of as great Renown, And solid Judgment in the Moon; That understood her various Soils, And which produc'd best Genet-moyles; And in the Register of Fame Had enter'd his long-living Name; After he had por'd long and hard In th' Engine, gave a Start, and star'd— Quoth he,—A stranger Sight appears Than e're was seen in all the Spheres, A Wonder more unparallel'd, Than ever mortal Tube beheld. An Elephant from one of those Two mighty Armies is broke loose, And with the Horrour of the Fight Appears amaz'd, and in a Fright; Look quickly, lest the Sight of us Should cause the startled Beast t' imboss. It is a large one, far more great Than e'er was bred in Afric yet; From which we boldly may infer, The Moon is much the fruitfuller. And, since the mighty Pyrrhus brought Those living Castles first, 'tis thought, Against the Romans, in the Field, It may an Argument be held (Arcadia being but a Piece, As his Dominions were, of Greece,) To prove, what this illustrious Person Has made so noble a Discourse on; And amply satisfy'd us all Of th' Privolvans Original. That Elephants are in the Moon, Though we had now discover'd none, Is easily made manifest; Since, from the greatest to the least, All other Stars and Constellations Have Cattle of all sorts of Nations; And Heaven, like a Tartar's Horde, With great and numerous Droves is stor'd: And, if the Moon produce by Nature A People of so vast a Stature, 'Tis consequent, she shou'd bring forth Far greater Beasts too, than the Earth; (As by the best Accounts appears Of all our great'st Discoverers) And, that those monstrous Creatures there Are not such Rarities as here. Mean while the rest had had a Sight Of all Particulars o' th' Fight; And ev'ry Man with equal Care, Perus'd of th' Elephant his Share, Proud of his Int'rest in the Glory Of so miraculous a Story: When one, who for his Excellence In height'ning Words and shad'wing Sense, And magnifying all he writ With curious microscopick Wit, Was magnify'd himself no less In home and foreign Colleges, Began, transported with the Twang Of his own Trillo, thus t' harangue. Most excellent and virtuous Friends, This great Discovery makes amends For all our unsuccessful Pains, And lost Expence of Time and Brains. For, by this sole Phænomenon, We've gotten Ground upon the Moon; And gain'd a Pass, to hold dispute With all the Planets that stand out; To carry this most virtuous War Home to the Door of every Star, And plant th' Artillery of our Tubes Against their proudest Magnitudes; To stretch our Victories beyond Th' Extent of planetary Ground; And fix our Engines, and our Ensigns Upon the fixt Stars vast Dimensions, (Which Archimede, so long ago, Durst not presume to wish to do) And prove, if they are other Suns, As some have held Opinions; Or Windows in the Empyreum, From whence those bright Effluvias come Like Flames of Fire (as others guess) That shine i' the Mouths of Furnaces. Nor is this all, we have atchiev'd, But more, henceforth to be believ'd, And have no more our best Designs, Because they're ours, believ'd ill Signs. T' out-throw, and stretch, and to enlarge Shall now no more be laid t' our Charge; Nor shall our ablest Virtuosos Prove Arguments for Coffee-houses; Nor those Devices, that are laid Too truly on us, nor those made, Hereafter gain Belief among Our strictest Judges, right or wrong; Nor shall our past Misfortunes more Be charg'd upon the ancient Score: No more our making old Dogs young Make Men suspect us still i' th' Wrong; Nor new-invented Chariots draw The Boys to course us, without Law; Nor putting Pigs t' a Bitch to nurse, To turn 'em into Mungrel-Curs, Make them suspect, our Sculs are brittle, And hold too much Wit, or too little: Nor shall our Speculations, whether An Elder-stick will save the Leather Of Schoolboy's Breeches from the Rod, Make all we do appear as odd. This one Discovery's enough, To take all former Scandals off— But, since the World's incredulous Of all our Scrutinies, and us; And with a Prejudice prevents Our best and worst Experiments; (As if th' were destin'd to miscarry, In consort try'd, or solitary) And since it is uncertain, when Such Wonders will occur agen, Let us as cautiously contrive, To draw an exact Narrative Of what we every one can swear, Our Eyes themselves have seen appear; That, when we publish the Account, We all may take our Oaths upon't. This said, they all with one Consent, Agreed to draw up th' Instrument, And, for the gen'ral Satisfaction, To print it in the next Transaction. But, whilst the Chiefs were drawing up This strange Memoir o' th' Telescope, One, peeping in the Tube by Chance, Beheld the Elephant advance, And, from the West-side of the Moon, To th' East was in a Moment gone. This b'ing related gave a Stop To what the rest were drawing up; And every Man amaz'd anew, How it could possibly be true, That any Beast should run a Race So monstrous, in so short a Space, Resolv'd, howe'er, to make it good, At least, as possible as he cou'd; And rather his own Eyes condemn, Than question what h' had seen with them. While all were thus resolv'd; a Man, Of great Renown there, thus began— 'Tis strange, I grant! But who can say What cannot be; what can, and may? Especially at so hugely vast A Distance, as this Wonder's plac't; Where the least Error of the Sight May show Things false, but never right: Nor can we try them so far off, By any sublunary Proof. For who can say, that Nature there Has the same Laws, she goes by here? Nor is it like, she has infus'd In every Species, there produc'd, The same Efforts, she does confer Upon the same Productions here: Since those with us, of several Nations, Have such prodigious Variations; And she affects so much to use Variety, in all she does. Hence may b' infer'd, that, tho' I grant We've seen i' th' Moon an Elephant, That Elephant may differ so From those upon the Earth below, Both in his Bulk, and Force, and Speed, As being of a diff'rent Breed; That, tho' our own are but slow-pac't, Theirs there may fly, or run as fast; And yet be Elephants no less, Than those of Indian Pedigrees. This said, another of great Worth, Fam'd for his learned Works put forth, Look'd wise, then said—All this is true, And learnedly observ'd by you: But there's another Reason for't, That falls but very little short Of mathematick Demonstration, Upon an accurate Calculation, And that is—As the Earth and Moon Do both move contrary upon Their Axes, the Rapidity Of both their Motions cannot be, But so prodigiously fast, That vaster Spaces may be past, In less Time than the Beast has gone, Though h' had no Motion of his own; Which we can take no Measure of, As you have clear'd by learned Proof. This granted, we may boldly thence Lay claim to a nobler Inference; And make this great Phænomenon (Were there no other) serve alone, To clear the grand Hypothesis Of th' Motion of the Earth from this. With this they all were satisfy'd, As Men are wont o' th' bias'd Side, Applauded the profound Dispute; And grew more gay and resolute By having overcome all doubt, Than if it never had fall'n out; And, to compleat their Narrative, Agreed t' insert this strange Retrieve. But, while they were diverted all With wording the Memorial, The Footboys, for Diversion too, As having nothing else to do, Seeing the Telescope at leisure, Turn'd Virtuosos for their Pleasure; Began to gaze upon the Moon, As those they waited on, had done, With Monkeys Ingenuity, That love to practise, what they see; When one, whose Turn it was to peep, Saw something in the Engine creep; And, viewing well, discover'd more, Than all the Learn'd had done before. Quoth he,—A little Thing is slunk Into the long star-gazing Trunk; And now is gotten down so nigh, I have him just against mine Eye. This being overheard by one, Who was not so far overgrown In any virtuous Speculation, To judge with mere Imagination, Immediately he made a Guess At solving all Appearances, A Way far more significant, Than all their Hints of th' Elephant; And found, upon a second View, His own Hypothesis most true; For he had scarce apply'd his Eye To th' Engine, but immediately He found, a Mouse was gotten in The hollow Tube, and shut between The two Glass-windows in Restraint Was swell'd into an Elephant; And prov'd the virtuous Occasion, Of all this learned Dissertation. And, as a Mountain heretofore Was great with Child, they say, and bore A silly Mouse; this Mouse, as strange, Brought forth a Mountain, in Exchange. Mean while, the rest in Consultation Had penn'd the wonderful Narration; And set their Hands, and Seals, and Wit T' attest the Truth of what th' had writ; When this accurst Phænomenon Confounded all th' had said or done. For 'twas no sooner hinted at, But th' all were in a Tumult strait, More furiously enrag'd by far, Than those that in the Moon made War, To find so admirable a Hint, When they had all agreed t' have seen't, And were engag'd to make it out, Obstructed with a paultry Doubt. When one, whose Task was to determin, And solve th' Appearances of Vermin; Wh' had made profound Discoveries In Frogs, and Toads, and Rats, and Mice; (Tho' not so curious, 'tis true, As many a wise Rat-catcher knew) After he had with Signs made Way For something great he had to say —This Disquisition Is, half of it, in my Discission: For, though the Elephant, as Beast, Belongs of Right to all the rest, The Mouse, b'ing but a Vermin, none Has Title to, but I alone; And therefore hope, I may be heard, In my own Province, with Regard. It is no Wonder, w' are cry'd down, And made the Talk of all the Town, That rants and swears, for all our great Attempts, we have done nothing yet, If ev'ry one have Leave to doubt, When some great Secret's half made out; And, 'cause perhaps it is not true, Obstruct, and ruin all we do. As no great Act was ever done, Nor ever can, with Truth alone; If nothing else but Truth w' allow, 'Tis no great Matter what we do. For Truth is too reserv'd, and nice, T' appear in mix'd Societies; Delights in solit'ry Abodes, And never shews her self in Crowds; A sullen little Thing, below All Matters of Pretence and Show; That deal in Novelty, and Change, Not of Things true, but rare and strange, To treat the World with what is fit, And proper to its nat'ral Wit; The World, that never sets Esteem On what Things are, but what they seem; And, if they be not strange and new, Th' are ne'er the better for b'ing true. For, what has Mankind gain'd by knowing His little Truth, but his Undoing, Which wisely was by Nature hidden, And only for his Good forbidden? And, therefore, with great Prudence does, The World still strive to keep it close; For if all secret Truths were known, Who would not be once more undone? For Truth has always Danger in't, And here, perhaps, may cross some Hint, We have already agreed upon, And vainly frustrate all we've done; Only to make new Work for Stubs, And all the academick Clubs. How much then ought we have a Care, That no Man know above his Share; Nor dare to understand, henceforth, More than his Contribution's worth: That those, wh' have purchas'd of the College A Share, or half a Share of Knowledge, And brought in none, but spent Repute, Should not b' admitted to dispute; Nor any Man pretend to know More than his Dividend comes to? For Partners have been always known To cheat their publick Int'rest prone; And, if we do not look to ours, 'Tis sure to run the self-same Course. This said, the whole Assembly allow'd The Doctrine to be right, and good; And, from the Truth of what th' had heard, Resolv'd to give Truth no Regard, But, what was for their Turn, to vouch, And either find, or make it such: That 'twas more noble to create Things like Truth, out of strong Conceit, Than, with vexatious Pains and Doubt, To find, or think t' have found her out. This b'ing resolv'd, they, one by one, Review'd the Tube, the Mouse, and Moon; But still, the narrower they pry'd, The more they were unsatisfy'd, In no one Thing, they saw, agreeing; As if th' had sev'ral Faiths of seeing. Some swore, upon a second View, That all th' had seen before was true, And that they never would recant One Syllable of th' Elephant; Avow'd, his Snout could be no Mouse's, But a true Elephant's Proboscis. Others began to doubt, and waver, Uncertain which o' th' two to favour; And knew not whether to espouse The Cause of th' Elephant, or Mouse. Some held no Way so orthodox To try it, as the Ballot-Box; And, like the Nation's Patriots, To find, or make, the Truth by Votes. Others conceiv'd it much more fit T' unmount the Tube, and open it; And, for their private Satisfaction, To re-examine the Transaction; And after explicate the rest, As they should find Cause for the best. To this, as th' only Expedient, The whole Assembly gave Consent: But, e're the Tube was half let down, It clear'd the first Phænomenon: For, at the End, prodigious Swarms Of Flies, and Gnats, like Men in Arms, Had all past Muster, by mischance, Both for the Sub, and Privolvans. This, b'ing discover'd, put them all Into a fresh, and fiercer Brawl, Asham'd, that Men so grave and wise Should be chaldes'd by Gnats and Flies, And take the feeble Insects' Swarms For mighty Troops of Men at Arms; As vain as those, who when the Moon Bright in a crystal River shone, Threw Casting-nets as su'tly at her, To catch and pull her out o' th' Water. But, when they had unscrew'd the Glass, To find out, where th' Impostor was, And saw the Mouse, that by mishap, Had made the Telescope a Trap, Amaz'd, confounded, and afflicted, To be so openly convicted, Immediately they get them gone, With this Discovery alone: That those who greedily pursue Things wonderful, instead of true; That in their Speculations chuse To make Discoveries strange News; And Nat'ral History a Gazette Of Tales stupendous, and far-fet; Hold no Truth worthy to be known, That is not huge, and over-grown, And explicate Appearances, Not as they are, but as they please, In vain strive Nature to suborn, And, for their Pains, are paid with Scorn. THE ELEPHANT IN THE MOON IN LONG VERSE A virtuous, learn'd Society, of late The Pride and Glory of a foreign State, Made an Agreement on a Summer's Night, To search the Moon at full, by her own Light; To take a perfect Invent'ry of all Her real Fortunes, or her Personal; And make a geometrical Survey, Of all her Lands, and how her Country lay, As accurate as that of Ireland, where The sly Surveyor 's said t' have sunk a Shire: T' observe her Country's Climate, how 'twas planted, And what she most abounded with, or wanted; And draw Maps of her prop'rest Situations For settling, and erecting new Plantations; If ever the Society should incline T' attempt so great, and glorious a Design: A Task in vain, unless theGerman Kepler Had found out a Discovery to people her, And stock her Country with Inhabitants Of military Men, and Elephants. For th' Ancients only took her for a Piece Of red-hot Iron, as big as Peloponese, Till he appear'd; for which, some write, she sent Upon his Tribe as strange a Punishment. This was the only Purpose of their Meeting, For which they chose a Time, and Place most fitting; When, at the Full, her equal Shares of Light And Influence were at their greatest Height. And now the lofty Telescope, the Scale, By which they venture Heav'n itself t' assail, Was rais'd, and planted full against the Moon; And all the rest stood ready to fall on, Impatient, who should bear away the Honour To plant an Ensign, first of all, upon her. When one, who, for his solid deep Belief, Was chosen Virtuoso then in chief; Had been approv'd the most profound, and wise At solving all Impossibilities, With Gravity advancing, to apply To th' Optick-glass his penetrating Eye, Cry'd out,—O strange!—then reinforc'd his Sight Against the Moon with all his Art and Might; And bent the Muscles of his pensive Brow, As if he meant to stare and gaze her thro', While all the rest began as much t' admire, And, like a Powder-train, from him took Fire, Surpriz'd with dull Amazement beforehand At what they would, but could not understand; And grew impatient to discover, what The Matter was, they so much wonder'd at. Quoth he,—The old Inhabitants o' th' Moon, Who, when the Sun shines hottest about Noon, Are wont to live in Cellars under ground, Of eight Miles deep, and more than eighty round, In which at once they use to fortify Against the Sun-beams, and the Enemy, Are counted Borough-Towns and Cities there, Because th' Inhabitants are civiler Than those rude Country Peasants, that are found, Like Mountaineers, to live on th' upper Ground, Nam'd Privolvans, with whom the others are Perpetually in state of open War. And now both Armies, mortally engrag'd Are in a fierce and bloody Fight engag'd; And many fall on both Sides kill'd and slain, As by the Telescope 'tis clear and plain. Look in it quickly then, that every one May see his Share before the Battle's done. At this, a famous great Philosopher, Admir'd, and celebrated, far and near As one of wond'rous singular Invention, And equal universal Comprehension, By which he had compos'd a Pedlars Jargon, For all the World to learn, and use in Bargain, An universal canting Idiom, To understand the swinging Pendulum, And to communicate, in all Designs, With th' Eastern Virtuoso-Mandarines, Apply'd an optick Nerve, and half a Nose To th' End and Center of the Engine, close: For he had, very lately, undertook To vindicate, and publish in a Book, That Men, whose native Eyes are blind, or out, May by more admirable Art, be brought To see with empty Holes as well and plain, As if their Eyes had been put in again. This great Man, therefore, having fix'd his Sight T' observe the bloody formidable Fight, Consider'd carefully, and then cry'd out, —'Tis true, the Battle's desperately fought; The gallant Subvolvans begin to rally, And from their Trenches valiantly sally, To fall upon the stubborn Enemy, Who fearfully begin to rout and fly. These paltry domineering Privolvans Have, every Summer-season, their Campains; And muster, like the military Sons Of Raw-head, and victorious Bloody-bones, As great and numerous as Soland-geese I' th' Summer-Islands of the Orcades, Couragiously to make a dreadful Stand And boldly face their Neighbour's Hand to Hand. Until the peaceful, long'd-for Winter's come; And then disband, and march in Triumph Home; And spend the rest of all the Year in Lies, And vap'ring of their unknown Victories. From th' old Arcadians they have been believ'd To be, before the Moon herself, deriv'd; And, when her Orb was first of all created, To be from thence, to people her, translated. For as those People had been long reputed Of all the Peloponesians, the most stupid, Whom nothing in the World could ever bring T' endure the civil Life, but Fiddling; They ever since retain the antique Course, And native Frenzy of their Ancestors; And always use to sing, and fiddle to Things of the most important Weight they do. While thus the Virtuoso entertains The whole Assembly with the Privolvans, Another Sophist, but of less Renown, Though longer Observation of the Moon; That understood the Diff'rence of her Soils, And which produc'd the fairest Gennet-moyles; But for an unpaid Weekly Shillings Pension, Had fin'd for Wit, and Judgment, and Invention; Who, after poring tedious and hard In th' Optic-Engine, gave a Start, and star'd, And thus began—A stranger Sight appears, Than ever yet was seen in all the Spheres; A greater Wonder, more unparallel'd Than ever mortal Tube, or Eye beheld; A mighty Elephant from one of those Two fighting Armies is at length broke loose, And with the desp'rate Horror of the Fight Appears amaz'd, and in a dreadful Fright: Look quickly, lest the only Sight of us Should cause the startled Creature to imboss. It is a large one, and appears more great Than ever was produc'd in Africk yet; From which we confidently may infer, The Moon appears to be the fruitfuller. And since, of old, the mighty Pyrrhus brought Those living Castles first of all, 'tis thought, Against the Roman Army in the Field; It may a valid Argument, be held, (The same Arcadia being but a Piece, As his Dominions were, of antique Greece) To vindicate, what this illustrious Person Has made so learn'd, and noble a Discourse on; And giv'n us ample Satisfaction all Of th' ancient Privolvans Original. That Elephants are really in the Moon, Although our Fortune had discover'd none, Is easily made plain, and manifest, Since from the greatest Orbs, down to the least, All other Globes of Stars and Constellations Have Cattle in 'em of all Sorts and Nations; And Heav'n like a northern Tartar's Horde, With numerous and mighty Droves is stor'd. And, if the Moon can but produce by Nature A People of so large, and vast a Stature, 'Tis more than probable, she should bring forth A greater Breed of Beasts too, than the Earth; As by the best Accounts we have, appears Of all our crediblest Discoverers; And, that those vast and monstrous Creatures there Are not such far-fet Rarities, as here. Meanwhile th'Assembly now had had a Sight Of all distinct Particulars o' th' Fight; And every Man with Diligence and Care Perus'd, and view'd of th'Elephant his Share, Proud of his equal Int'rest in the Glory Of so stupendous, and renown'd a Story, When one, who for his Fame and Excellence In heightening of Words, and shadowing Sense, And magnifying all, he ever writ, With delicate, and Microscopick Wit, Had long been magnify'd himself no less In foreign and domestick Colleges, Began at last (transported with the Twang Of his own Elocution) thus t' harangue. Most virtuous, and incomparable Friends, This great Discov'ry fully makes amends For all our former unsuccessful Pains, And lost Expences of our Time and Brains: For, by this admirable Phænomenon, We now have gotten Ground upon the Moon; And gain'd a Pass t' engage, and hold Dispute With all the other Planets, that stand out; And carry on this brave and virtuous War Home to the Door of th' obstinatest Star; And plant th' Artillery of our Optick Tubes Against the proudest of their Magnitudes; To stretch our future Victories beyond The uttermost of Planetary Ground; And plant our warlike Engines, and our Ensigns Upon the fix'd Stars spacious Dimensions, To prove, if they are other Suns, or not, As some Philosophers have wisely thought, Or only Windows in the Empyreum, Through which those bright Effluvias use to come; Which Archimede, so many Years ago, Durst never venture, but to wish to know. Nor is this all, that we have now atchiev'd, But greater Things!—Henceforth to be believ'd, And have no more our best, and worst Designs, Because th' are ours, suspected for ill Signs. T' out-throw, and magnify, and to enlarge Shall, henceforth, be no more laid to our charge; Nor shall our best and ablest Virtuosos Prove Arguments again for Coffee-Houses; Nor little Stories gain Belief among Our criticalest Judges right or wrong: Nor shall our new-invented Chariots draw The Boys to course us in 'em, without Law: Make Chips of Elms produce the largest Trees, Or sowing Saw-dust furnish Nurseries: No more our heading Darts (a swinging one!) With Butter only harden'd in the Sun; Or Men that use to whistle loud enough To be heard by others plainly five Miles off, Cause all the rest, we own, and have avow'd To be believ'd as desperately loud. Nor shall our future Speculations, whether An Elder-stick will render all the Leather Of School-boys Breeches proof against the Rod, Make all we undertake appear as odd. This one Discovery will prove enough To take all past and future Scandals off: But since the World is so incredulous Of all our usual Scrutinies and us, And with a constant Prejudice prevents Our best, as well as worst Experiments, As if they were all destin'd to miscarry, As well in Concert try'd, as solitary; And that th'Assembly is uncertain, when Such great Discoveries will occur agen, 'Tis reas'nable, we should, at least, contrive To draw up as exact a Narrative Of that which every Man of us can swear, Our Eyes themselves have plainly seen appear; That when 'tis fit to publish the Account, We all may take our several Oaths upon't. This said, the whole Assembly gave Consent To drawing up th' authentick Instrument; And, for the Nation's general Satisfaction, To print, and own it in their next Transaction. But while their ablest Men were drawing up The wonderful Memoir o' th' Telescope, A Member peeping in the Tube, by chance, Beheld the Elephant begin t' advance, That from the West-by-North Side of the Moon To th' East-by-South was in a Moment gone. This, being related, gave a sudden Stop To all, their Grandees had been drawing up; And every Person was amaz'd a-new, How such a strange Surprizal should be true; Or any Beast perform so great a Race, So swift and rapid, in so short a Space, Resolv'd, as suddenly, to make it good, Or render all as fairly as they cou'd; And rather choose their own Eyes to condemn, Than question, what they had beheld with them. While every one was thus resolv'd, a Man Of great Esteem, and Credit, thus began; —'Tis strange, I grant! but who, alas! can say, What cannot be, or justly can, and may, Especially at so hugely wide and vast A Distance, as this Miracle is plac't, Where the least Error of the Glass, or Sight, May render Things amiss, but never right? Nor can we try them, when th' are so far off, By any equal sublunary Proof: For who can justify, that Nature there Is ty'd to the same Laws, she acts by here? Nor is it probable, she has infus'd Int' every Species, in the Moon produc'd, The same Efforts, she uses to confer Upon the very same Productions here: Since those upon the Earth, of several Nations, Are found t' have such prodigious Variations; And she affects so constantly to use Variety in every Thing she does. From hence may be inferr'd, that, tho' I grant, We have beheld i' th' Moon an Elephant, That Elephant may chance to differ so From those with us, upon the Earth below, Both in his Bulk, as well as Force and Speed, As b'ing of a different Kind and Breed, That, tho' 'tis true, our own are but slow pac'd, Their's there, perhaps, may fly, or run as fast, And yet be very Elephants, no less Than those deriv'd from Indian Families. This said, another Member of great Worth, Fam'd for the learned Works he had put forth, In which the mannerly, and modest Author Quotes the Right Worshipful, his elder Brother, Look'd wise a while, then said—All this is true, And very learnedly observ'd by you; But there's another nobler Reason for't, That rightly 'bserv'd, will fall, but little, short Of solid mathematick Demonstration, Upon a full, and perfect Calculation; And that is only this—As th' Earth and Moon Do constantly move contrary upon Their several Axes, the Rapidity Of both their Motions cannot fail to be So violent, and naturally fast, That larger Distances may well be past, In less Time than the Elephant has gone, Altho' he had no Motion of his own, Which we on Earth can take no Measure of; As you have made it evident by Proof. This granted, we may confidently hence Claim Title to another Inference; And make this wonderful Phænomenon (Were there no other) serve our Turn alone, To vindicate the grand Hypothesis, And prove the Motion of the Earth from this. This said, th' Assembly now was satisfy'd, As Men are soon upon the biast Side; With great Applause receiv'd th' admir'd Dispute, And grew more gay, and brisk, and resolute, By having (right or wrong) remov'd all doubt, Than if th' Occasion never had fall'n out; Resolving to compleat their Narrative, And punctually insert this strange Retrieve. But, while their Grandees were diverted all With nicely wording the Memorial, The Footboys for their own Diversion too, As having nothing, now, at all to do, And when they saw the Telescope at leisure, Turn'd Virtuosos, only for their Pleasure; With Drills and Monkeys Ingenuity, That take Delight to practice all they see, Began to stare and gaze upon the Moon, As those they waited on, before had done. When one, whose Turn it was, by chance to peep, Saw something in the lofty Engine creep; And, viewing carefully, discover'd more Than all their Masters hit upon before. Quoth he,—O strange! a little Thing is slunk On th' Inside of the long star-gazing Trunk; And now is gotten down so low and nigh, I have him here directly 'gainst mine Eye. This chancing to be overheard by one, Who was not, yet, so hugely overgrown In any philosophic Observation, As to conclude with mere Imagination; And yet he made immediately a Guess At fully solving all Appearances, A plainer Way, and more significant, Than all their Hints had prov'd o' th' Elephant; And quickly found upon a second View, His own Conjecture, probably, most true: For he no sooner had apply'd his Eye To th' optick Engine, but immediately He found a small Field-Mouse was gotten in The hollow Telescope, and shut between The two Glass-Windows, closely in restraint, Was magnify'd into an Elephant; And prov'd the happy virtuous Occasion Of all this deep and learned Dissertation. And as a mighty Mountain heretofore, Is said t' have been begot with Child, and bore A silly Mouse, this captive Mouse, as strange, Produc'd another Mountain in Exchange. Mean while the Grandees, long in Consultation, Had finish'd the miraculous Narration, And set their Hands, and Seals, and Sense, and Wit T' attest and vouch the Truth of all th' had writ; When this unfortunate Phænomenon Confounded all they had declar'd and done. For 'twas no sooner told, and hinted at, But all the rest were in a Tumult straight, More hot and furiously inrag'd, by far, Than both the Hosts, that in the Moon made War, To find so rare and admirable a Hint, When they had all agreed, and sworn t' have seen't, And had engag'd themselves to make it out, Obstructed with a wretched paultry Doubt. When one, whose only Task was to determin, And solve the worst Appearances of Vermin; Who oft' had made profound Discoveries In Frogs and Toads, as well as Rats and Mice (Though not so curious and exact, 'tis true As many an exquisite Rat-catcher knew) After he had a while with Signs made way For something pertinent, he had to say, At last prevail'd—Quoth he—this Disquisition Is, the one half of it, in my Discission: For tho', 'tis true, the Elephant, as Beast, Belongs, of nat'ral Right, to all the Rest; The Mouse, that's but a paultry Vermin, none Can claim a Title to, but I alone; And therefore humbly hope, I may be heard In my own Province freely, with Regard. It is no Wonder, that we are cry'd down, And made the Table-talk of all the Town, That Rants and Vapours still, for all our great Designs and Projects, we've done nothing yet, If every one have Liberty to doubt, When some great Secret's more than half made out, Because, perhaps, it will not hold out true, And put a stop to all w' Attempt to do. As no great Action ever has been done, Nor ever's like to be by Truth alone, If nothing else but only Truth w' allow 'Tis no great Matter what w' intend to do; For Truth is always too reserv'd and chaste, T' indure to be by all the Town embrac'd, A solitary Anchorite that dwells, Retir'd from all the World in obscure Cells, Disdains all great Assemblys, and defies The Press and Crowd of mix'd Societies, That use to deal in Novelty and Change, Not of things true, but great, and rare, and strange; To entertain the World with what is fit And proper for its Genius, and its Wit; The World, that's never found to set Esteem On what Things are, but what th' appear, and seem; And, if they are not wonderful and new, Th' are ne're the better for their being true. For what is Truth, or Knowledge, but a Kind Of Wantonness and Luxury o' th' Mind, A Greediness and Gluttony o' the Brain, That longs to eat forbidden Fruit again, And grows more desp'rate, like the worst Diseases, Upon the nobler Part (the Mind) it seizes? And what has Mankind ever gain'd by knowing His little Truths, unless his own Undoing, That prudently by Nature had been hidden, And, only for his greater Good, forbidden? And therefore with as great Discretion does The World endeavour still to keep it close: For if the Secrets of all Truths were known, Who would not, once more, be as much undone? For Truth is never without Danger in't, As here it has depriv'd us of a Hint, The whole Assembly had agreed upon, And utterly defeated all w' had done, By giving Foot-Boys leave to interpose And disappoint, whatever we propose, For nothing but to cut out Work for Stubs, And all the busy Academick Clubs, For which they have deserv'd to run the Risks Of Elder-sticks, and penitential Frisks. How much then ought we have a special Care, That none presume to know above his Share, Nor take upon him t' understand, henceforth, More than his weekly Contribution's worth: That all those, that have purchas'd of the College A half, or but a quarter Share of Knowlege, And brought none in themselves, but spent Repute, Should never be admitted to dispute; Nor any Member undertake to know More than his equal Dividend comes to? For Partners have perpetually been known, T' impose upon their publick Int'rest, prone; And, if we have not greater Care of ours, It will be sure to run the self-same Course. This said, the whole Society allow'd The Doctrine to be orthodox, and good; And from th' apparent Truth of what th' had heard, Resolv'd, henceforth, to give Truth no Regard, But what was for their Interests to vouch, And either find it out, or make it such: That 'twas more admirable to create Inventions like Truth out of strong Conceit, Than with vexatious Study, Pains, and Doubt, To find, or but suppose t' have found it out. This b'ing resolv'd, th' Assembly, one by one, Review'd the Tube, the Elephant, and Moon; But still the more, and curiouser they pry'd, They but became the more unsatisfy'd, In no one Thing, they gaz'd upon, agreeing, As if th' had different Principles of seeing. Some boldly swore, upon a second View, That all they had beheld before, was true, And damn'd themselves, they never would recant One syllable, th' had seen, of th' Elephant; Avow'd his Shape and Snout could be no Mouse's, But a true nat'ral Elephant's Proboscis. Others began to doubt as much, and waver, Uncertain which to disallow, or favour; Until they had as many cross Resolves, As Irishmen that have been turn'd to Wolves, And grew distracted, whether to espouse The Party of the Elephant, or Mouse. Some held, there was no Way so orthodox, As to refer it to the Ballot-Box; And, like some other Nation's Patriots, To find it out, or make the Truth, by Votes. Others were of Opinion, 'twas more fit T' unmount the Telescope, and open it, And for their own, and all Men's Satisfaction To search, and re-examin the Transaction; And afterward to explicate the rest, As they should see Occasion for the best. To this, at length, as th' only Expedient, The whole Assembly freely gave Consent: But, 'ere the optic Tube was half let down, Their own Eyes clear'd the first Phænomenon: For, at the upper End, prodigious Swarms Of busy Flies and Gnats, like Men in Arms, Had all past Muster in the Glass by chance, For both the Peri- and the Subvolvans. This b'ing discover'd, once more put them all Into a worse, and desperater Brawl, Surpriz'd with Shame, that Men so grave and wise Should be trepann'd by paultry Gnats and Flies; And to mistake the feeble Insects swarms For Squadrons, and Reserves of Men in Arms: As politick as those, who, when the Moon As bright and glorious in a River shone, Threw Casting-nets, with equal Cunning at her To catch her with, and pull her out o' th' Water. But when at last, they had unscrew'd the Glass, To find out where the sly Impostor was, And saw 'twas but a Mouse, that by mishap Had catch'd himself, and them, in th' optick Trap, Amaz'd, with Shame confounded, and afflicted To find themselves so openly convicted, Immediately made haste to get them gone, With none, but this Discovery alone: That learned Men, who greedily pursue Things, that are rather wonderful than true, And, in their nicest Speculations, choose To make their own Discoveries strange News, And Nat'ral Hist'ry rather a Gazette Of Rarities stupendous, and far-fet; Believe no Truths are worthy to be known, That are not strongly vast, and overgrown; And strive to explicate Appearances, Not as they're probable, but as they please, In vain endeavour Nature to suborn, And, for their Pains, are justly paid with Scorn. SATYR UPON THE ROYAL SOCIETY A learned Man, whom once a Week A hundred Virtuoso's seek, And like an Oracle apply to, T' ask Questions, and admire, and lye to, Who entertain'd them all of Course (As Men take Wives for better or worse) And past them all for Men of Parts, Though some but Sceptics in their Hearts: For when they're cast into a Lump, Their Talents equally must jump; As Metals mixt, the rich and base Do both at equal Values pass. With these the ord'nary Debate Was after News, and Things of State, Which Way the dreadful Comet went In sixty-four, and what it meant? What Nations yet are to bewail The Operation of its Tail; Or whether France, or Holland yet, Or Germany be in its Debt? What Wars and Plagues in Christendom Have happened since, and what to come? What Kings are dead, how many Queens And Princesses are poison'd since; And who shall next of all by Turn Make Courts wear black, and Tradesmen mourn? What Parties next of Foot, or Horse Will rout, or routed be of Course? What German Marches, and Retreats Will furnish the next Month's Gazettes? What pestilent Contagion next, And what Part of the World infects? What dreadful Meteor, and where Shall in the Heavens next appear; And when again shall lay Embargo Upon the Admiral, the good Ship Argo? Why Currents turn in Seas of Ice Some thrice a Day, and some but twice; And why the Tides at Night and Noon Court, like Caligula, the Moon? What is the nat'ral Cause why Fish, That always drink, do never piss; Or whether in their Home the Deep By Night or Day they ever sleep? If Grass be green, or Snow be white, But only as they take the Light? Whether Possessions of the Devil, Or mere Temptations do most evil? What is't, that makes all Fountains still Within the Earth to run up Hill; But on the Outside down again, As if th' Attempt had been in vain? Or what's the strange magnetic Cause, The Steel or Loadstone's drawn, or draws, The Star, the Needle, which the Stone Has only been but touch'd upon? Whether the North-Star's Influence With both does hold Intelligence; (For red-hot Ir'n, held tow'rds the Pole, Turns of it self to't, when 'tis cool) Or whether Male and Female screws In th' Ir'n and Stone th' Effect produce? What makes the Body of the Sun, That such a rapid Course does run, To draw no Tail behind through th' Air, As Comets do, when they appear, Which other Planets cannot do, Because they do not burn, but glow? Whether the Moon be Sea, or Land, Or Charcoal, or a quench'd Firebrand; Or if the dark Holes that appear, Are only Pores, not Cities there? Whether the Atmosphere turn round, And keep a just Pace with the Ground; Or loiter lazily behind, And clog the Air with Gusts of Wind? Or whether Crescents in the Wane (For so an Author had it plain) Do burn quite out, or wear away Their Snuffs upon the Edge of Day? Whether the Sea increase, or waste, And, if it do, how long 'twill last; Or if the Sun approaches near The Earth, how soon it will be there? These were their learned Speculations And all their constant Occupations; To measure Wind, and weigh the Air, And turn a Circle to a Square; To make a Powder of the Sun, By which all Doctors should b' undone To find the North-west Passage out, Although the farthest Way about; If Chymists from a Rose's Ashes Can raise the Rose itself in Glasses; Whether the Line of Incidence Rise from the Object, or the Sense? To stew th' Elixir in a Bath Of Hope, Credulity, and Faith; To explicate by subtle Hints The Grain of Diamonds and Flints, And in the Braying of an Ass Find out the Treble and the Base; If Mares neigh alto, and a Cow A double Diapason low. SATYR UPON THE WEAKNESS AND MISERY OF MAN Who would believe, that wicked Earth, Where Nature only brings us forth, To be found guilty, and forgiven, Should be a Nursery for Heaven; When all, we can expect to do, Will not pay half the Debt we owe, And yet more desperately dare, As if that wretched Trifle were Too much for the eternal Pow'rs, Our great and mighty Creditors, Not only slight what they enjoin, But pay it in adulterate Coin? We only in their Mercy trust, To be more wicked and unjust: All our Devotions, Vows, and Pray'rs Are our own Interest, not theirs: Our Off'rings, when we come t' adore, But begging Presents, to get more: The purest Business of our Zeal Is but to err, by meaning well, And make that Meaning do more harm, Than our worst Deeds, that are less warm: For the most wretched and perverse Does not believe himself, he errs. Our holy'st Actions have been Th' Effects of Wickedness and Sin; Religious Houses made Compounders For th' horrid Actions of the Founders; Steeples, that totter'd in the Air, By Letchers sin'd into Repair; As if we had retain'd no Sign, Nor Character of the divine And heav'nly Part of human Nature, But only the coarse earthy Matter. Our universal Inclination Tends to the worst of our Creation, As if the Stars conspir'd t' imprint In our whole Species, by Instinct, A fatal Brand, and Signature Of nothing else, but the Impure. The best of all our Actions tend To the preposterousest End, And, like to Mungrels, we're inclin'd To take most to th' ignobler Kind; Or Monsters, that have always least Of th' human Parent, not the Beast. Hence 'tis we've no Regard at all Of our best half Original; But, when they differ, still assert The Int'rest of th' ignobler Part; Spend all the Time we have upon The vain Capriches of the one, But grudge to spare one Hour, to know What to the better Part we owe. As in all compound Substances The greater still devours the less; So, being born and bred up near Our earthy gross Relations here, Far from the ancient nobler Place Of all our high paternal Race, We now degenerate, and grow As barbarous, and mean, and low, As modern Grecians are, and worse, To their brave nobler Ancestors. Yet, as no Barbarousness beside Is half so barbarous as Pride, Nor any prouder Insolence Than that, which has the least Pretence, We are so wretched, to profess A Glory in our Wretchedness; To vapour sillily, and rant Of our own Misery, and Want, And grow vain-glorious on a Score, We ought much rather to deplore, Who, the first Moment of our Lives, Are but condemn'd, and giv'n Reprieves; And our great'st Grace is not to know, When we shall pay 'em back, nor how, Begotten with a vain Caprich, And live as vainly to that Pitch. Our Pains are real Things, and all Our Pleasures but fantastical; Diseases of their own Accord, But Cures come difficult and hard; Our noblest Piles, and stateliest Rooms Are but Out-houses to our Tombs; Cities, though e're so great and brave, But mere Ware-houses to the Grave; Our Bravery's but a vain Disguise, To hide us from the World's dull Eyes, The Remedy of a Defect, With which our Nakedness is deckt; Yet makes us swell with Pride, and boast, As if w' had gain'd by being lost. All this is nothing to the Evils, Which Men, and their confed'rate Devils Inflict, to aggravate the Curse On their own hated Kind, much worse; As if by Nature th' had been serv'd More gently, than their Fate deserv'd, Take pains (in Justice) to invent, And study their own Punishment; That, as their Crimes should greater grow, So might their own Inflictions too. Hence bloody Wars at first began, The artificial Plague of Man, That from his own Invention rise, To scourge his own Iniquities; That if the Heav'ns should chance to spare Supplies of constant poison'd Air, They might not, with unfit Delay, For lingering Destruction stay; Nor seek Recruits of Death so far, But plague themselves with Blood and War. And if these fail, there is no good, Kind Nature ere on Man bestow'd, But he can easily divert To his own Misery and Hurt; Make that, which Heaven meant to bless Th' ungrateful World with, gentle Peace With Luxury and Excess, as fast As War and Desolation, waste; Promote Mortality, and kill, As fast as Arms, by sitting still; Like Earthquakes slay without a Blow, And only moving overthrow; Make Law and Equity as dear, As Plunder and Free-quarter were, And fierce Encountres at the Bar Undo as fast, as those in War; Enrich Bawds, Whores, and Usurers, Pimps, Scriv'ners, silenc't Ministers, That get Estates by being undone For tender Conscience, and have none; Like those, that with their Credit drive A Trade without a Stock, and thrive; Advance Men in the Church and State For being of the meanest Rate, Rais'd for their double-guil'd deserts, Before Integrity and Parts; Produce more grievious Complaints For Plenty, than before for Wants, And make a rich and fruitful Year A greater Grievance, than a dear; Make Jests of greater Dangers far, Than those they trembl'd at in War; Till, unawares, they've laid a Train To blow the Publick up again; Rally with Horror, and in Sport Rebellion and Destruction court, And make Fanatics, in Despight Of all their Madness, reason right, And vouch to all they have foreshown, As other Monsters oft have done. Although from Truth and Sense as far, As all their other Maggots are: For Things said false, and never meant, Do oft prove true by accident. That Wealth, that bounteous Fortune sends As presents to her dearest Friends, Is oft laid out upon a Purchase Of two Yards long in Parish Churches; And those too happy Men that bought it, Had liv'd, and happier too, without it. For what does vast Wealth bring, but Cheat, Law, Luxury, Disease, and Debt, Pain, Pleasure, Discontent, and Sport An easy-troubled Life, and short? But all these Plagues are nothing near Those far more cruel and severe, Unhappy Man takes Pains to find, T' inflict himself upon his Mind; And out of his own Bowels spins A Rack and Torture for his Sins: Torments himself, in vain, to know That most, which he can never do; And the more strictly 'tis denied, The more he is unsatisfied; Is busy in finding Scruples out, To languish in eternal Doubt, Sees Spectres in the Dark, and Ghosts, And starts, as Horses do at Posts; And, when his Eyes assist him least, Discerns such subtle Objects best: On hypothetic Dreams and Visions Grounds everlasting Disquisitions, And raises endless Controversies On vulgar Theorems and Hearsays: Grows positive and confident In Things so far beyond th' Extent Of human Sense, he does not know, Whether they be at all, or no; And doubts as much in Things, that are As plainly evident, and clear: Disdains all useful Sense, and plain, T' apply to th' Intricate and Vain; And cracks his Brains in plodding on That, which is never to be known; To pose himself with Subtleties, And hold no other Knowledge wise; Although, the subtler all Things are, They're but to nothing the more near: And the less Weight they can sustain, The more he still lays on in vain; And hangs his Soul upon as nice And subtle Curiosities, As one of that vast Multitude, That on a Needle's Point have stood: Weighs right and wrong, and true and false Upon as nice and subtle Scales, As those that turn upon a Plane With th' hundredth Part of half a Grain; And still the subt[i]ler they move, The sooner false and useless prove. So Man, that thinks to force and strain Beyond its natural Sphere his Brain, In vain torments it on the Rack, And, for improving, sets it back; Is ign'rant of his own Extent, And that to which his Aims are bent, Is lost in both, and breaks his Blade Upon the Anvil, where 'twas made: For as Abortions cost more Pain Than vig'rous Births; so all the vain And weak Productions of Man's Wit, That aim at Purposes unfit, Require more Drudgery, and worse Than those of strong and lively Force. SATYR UPON THE LICENTIOUS AGE OF CHARLES THE 2D 'Tis a strange Age we've liv'd in, and a lewd As 'ere the Sun in all his Travels view'd; An Age as vile, as ever Justice urg'd, Like a fantastic Letcher, to be scourg'd: Nor has it scap'd, and yet has only learn'd, The more 'tis plagu'd to be the less concern'd. Twice have we seen two dreadful Judgments rage, Enough to fright the stubborn'st-hearted Age; The one to mow vast Crowds of People down, The other (as then needless) half the Town; And two as mighty Miracles restore, What both had ruin'd and destroy'd before: In all as unconcern'd, as if th' had been But Pastimes for Diversion to be seen. Or, like the Plagues of Ægypt, meant a Curse, Not to reclaim us, but to make us worse. Twice have Men turn'd the World (that silly Blockhead!) The wrong Side outward, like a Jugler's Pocket, Shook out Hypocrisy, as fast and loose, As e're the Dev'l could teach, or Sinners use, And on the other Side at once put in As impotent Iniquity, and Sin. As Sculls, that have been crack'd, are often found Upon the wrong Side to receive the Wound, And, like Tobacco-pipes at one End hit, To break at th' other still that's opposite: So Men, who one Extravagance would shun, Into the contrary Extreme have run; And all the Difference is, that, as the first Provokes the other Freak to prove the worst; So, in return, that strives to render less The last Delusion, with its own Excess; And, like two unskill'd Gamesters, use one Way With bungling t' help out one another's Play. For those, who heretofore sought private Holes, Securely in the Dark to damn their Souls, Wore Vizards of Hypocrisy, to steal And slink away, in Masquerade, to Hell, Now bring their Crimes into the open Sun, For all Mankind to gaze their worst upon, As Eagles try their Young against his Rays, To prove, if they're of generous Breed, or base; Call Heav'n and Earth to witness, how they've aim'd With all their utmost Vigour to be damn'd, And by their own Examples, in the View Of all the World, striv'd to damn others too: On all Occasions sought to be as civil, As possible they cou'd, t' his Grace the Devil, To give him unnecessary Trouble, Nor in small Matters use a Friend so noble, But with their constant Practice done their best T' improve, and propagate his Interest. For Men have now made Vice so great an Art, The matter of Fact's become the slightest Part; And the debauched'st Actions they can do, Mere Trifles, to the Circumstance and Show. For 'tis not what they do, that's now the Sin, But what they lewdly affect, and glory in; As if prepost'rously they would profess A forc'd Hypocrisy of Wickedness: And Affectation, that makes good Things bad, Must make affected Shame accurst, and mad; For Vices for themselves may find Excuse, But never for their Complement, and Shews. That, if there ever were a Mystery Of moral secular Iniquity, And that the Churches may not lose their Due By being encroach'd upon, 'tis now, and new. For Men are now as scrupulous, and nice, And tender-conscienc'd of low paltry Vice, Disdain as proudly to be thought to have To do in any Mischief, but the brave, As the most scrup'lous Zealot of late Times T' appear in any, but the horrid'st Crimes; Have as precise and strict Punctilios Now to appear, as then to make no Shows; And steer the World by disagreeing Force Of diff'rent Customs 'gainst her nat'ral Course. So pow'rful's ill Example to incroach, And Nature, spite of all her Laws, debauch; Example, that imperious Dictator Of all that's good, or bad to human Nature; By which the World's corrupted, and reclaim'd, Hopes to be sav'd, and studies to be damn'd; That reconciles all Contrarieties, Makes Wisdom Foolishness, and Folly wise, Imposes on Divinity, and sets Her Seal alike on Truths, and Counterfeits; Alters all Characters of Virtue and Vice, And passes one for th' other in Disguise, Makes all Things, as it pleases, understood, The Good receiv'd for Bad, and Bad for Good; That slyly counter-changes Wrong and Right, Like white in Fields of black, and black in white, As if the Laws of Nature had been made Of purpose, only to be disobey'd; Or Man had lost his mighty Interest, By having been distinguish'd from a Beast; And had no other Way but Sin and Vice, To be restor'd again to Paradise. How copious is our Language lately grown, To make blaspheming Wit, and a Jargon? And yet how expressive and significant, In Damme at once to curse, and swear, and rant? As if no way exprest Mens Souls so well, As damning of them to the Pit of Hell; Nor any Asseveration were so civil, As mortgaging Salvation to the Devil; Or that his Name did add a charming Grace, And Blasphemy a Purity to our Phrase. For what can any Language more enrich, Than to pay Souls for vitiating Speech; When the great'st Tyrant in the World made those But lick their Words out, that abus'd his Prose? What trivial Punishments did then protect To publick Censure a profound Respect, When the most shameful Penance and severe, That could b' inflicted on a Cavaliere For infamous Debauch'ry, was no worse, Than but to be degraded from his Horse, And have his Livery of Oats and Hay, Instead of cutting Spurs off, ta'n away? They held no Torture then so great as Shame, And, that to slay was less than to defame; For just so much regard, as Men express To th' censure of the Publick, more or less, The same will be return'd to them again, In Shame or Reputation, to a Grain: And, how perverse so'ere the World appears, 'Tis just to all the Bad it sees, and hears. And, for that Virtue, strives to be allow'd For all the Injuries, it does the Good. How silly were their Sages heretofore To fright their Heroes with a Syren-Whore? Make 'em believe a Water-witch with Charms Could sink their Men of War, as easy as Storms, And turn their Mariners, that heard them sing, Into Land-porpusses, and Cod, and Ling; To terrify those mighty Champions, As we do Children now with Bloody-bones; Until the subtlest of their Conjurors Seal'd up the Labels to his Soul, his Ears, And ty'd his deafen'd Sailors (while he pass'd The dreadful Lady's Lodgings) to the Mast, And rather venture drowning, than to wrong The Sea-pugs chaste Ears with a bawdy Song: To b' out of Countenance, and like an Ass, Not pledge the Lady Circe one Beer-glass; Unmannerly refuse her Treat and Wine, For fear of being turn'd into a Swine; When one of our heroic Advent'rers now Would drink her down, and turn her int' a Sow. So simple were those Times, when a grave Sage Could with an Oldwive's-Tale instruct the Age; Teach Virtue, more fantastick Ways and nice, Than ours will now endure t' improve in vice, Made a dull Sentence, and a moral Fable Do more, than all our Holdings-forth are able; A forc'd obscure Mythology convince, Beyond our worst Inflictions upon Sins. When an old Proverb, or an End of Verse Could more, than all our Penal Laws, coerce; And keep Men honester than all our Furies Of Jailors, Judges, Constables, and Juries; Who were converted then with an old Saying, Better than all our Preaching now, and praying. What Fops had these been, had they liv'd with us, Where the best Reason's made ridiculous; And all the plain and sober Things we say, By Raillery are put beside their Play? For Men are grown above all Knowledge now, And, what they're ignorant of, disdain to know; Engross Truth (like Fanatics) underhand, And boldly judge, before they understand, The self-same Courses equally advance In spiritual, and carnal Ignorance; And, by the same Degrees of Confidence, Become impregnable against all Sense; For, as they outgrew Ordinances then, So would they now Morality agen. Tho' Drudgery and Knowledge are of Kin, And both descended from one Parent Sin; And therefore seldom have been known to part, In tracing out the Ways of Truth, and Art; Yet they have North-west Passages to steer A short Way to it, without Pains or Care. For, as implicit Faith is far more stiff, Than that which understands its own Belief; So those, that think, and do but think, they know, Are far more obstinate, than those that do, And more averse, than if they'd ne'er been taught A wrong Way, to a right one to be brought; Take Boldness upon Credit beforehand, And grow too positive to understand; Believe themselves as knowing, and as famous, As if their Gifts had gotten a Mandamus, A Bill of Store to take up a Degree, With all the Learning to it, Custom-free; And look as big, for what they bought at Court, As if they'd done their Exercises for't. SATYR UPON GAMING What Fool would trouble Fortune more, When she has been too kind before; Or tempt her to take back again, What she had thrown away in vain; By idly vent'ring her good Graces To be dispos'd of by Alms-Aces; Or settling it in Trust to Uses, Out of his Pow'r, on Trays and Deuses: To put it to the Chance, and try, I' th' Ballot of a Box and Dye, Whether his Money be his own, And lose it, if he be o'erthrown; As if he were betray'd, and set By his own Stars to every Cheat, Or wretchedly condemn'd by Fate To throw Dice for his own Estate; As Mutineers, by fatal Doom, Do for their Lives upon a Drum? For what less Influence can produce, So great a Monster as a Chowse; Or any two-leg'd Thing possess With such a brutish Sottishness? Unless those tutelary Stars, Intrusted by Astrologers To have the Charge of Man, combin'd To use him in the self-same Kind; As those, that help'd them to the Trust, Are wont to deal with others just. For to become so sadly dull And stupid, as to fine for Gull, (Not, as in Cities, to b' excus'd, But to be judg'd fit to be us'd) That, whoso'ere can draw it in Is sure inevitably t' win; And, with a curs'd half-witted Fate, To grow more dully desperate, The more 'tis made a common Prey, And cheated foppishly at Play, Is their Condition: Fate betrays To Folly first, and then destroys. For what, but Miracles, can serve So great a Madness to preserve; As his, that ventures Goods and Chattles (Where there's no Quarter giv'n) in Battles, And fights with Money-bags as bold, As Men with Sand-bags did of old: Puts Lands, and Tenements, and Stocks Into a paultry Jugler's Box; And, like an Alderman of Gotham, Embarketh in so vile a Bottom: Engages blind and senseless Hap 'Gainst High, and Low, and Slur and Knap, (As Tartars with a Man of Straw Encounter Lions, Hand to Paw) With those, that never venture more, Than they had safely 'nsur'd before; Who, when they knock the Box and shake, Do, like the Indian Rattle-Snake, But strive to ruin, and destroy Those that mistake it for fair Play: That have their Fulhams at command, Brought up to do their Feats at hand; That understand their Calls and Knocks, And how to place themselves i' th' Box; Can tell the Oddses of all Games, And when to answer to their Names; And, when he conjures them t' appear, Like Imps are ready every where; When to play foul, and when run fair (Out of Design) upon the Square; And let the greedy Cully win, Only to draw him further in: While those, with which he idly plays, Have no regard to what he says; Although he Jernie and blaspheme, When they miscarry, Heav'n and them; And damn his Soul, and swear, and curse, And crucify his Saviour worse Than those Jew-Troopers, that threw out, When they were raffling for his Coat; Denounce Revenge, as if they heard, And rightly understood, and fear'd, And would take heed another Time, How to commit so bold a Crime; When the poor Bones are innocent Of all he did, or said or meant, And have as little Sense almost, As he that damns them, when h' has lost: As if he had rely'd upon Their Judgement, rather than his own; And that it were their Fault, not his, That manag'd them himself amiss: And gave them ill Instructions, how To run, as he would have them do, And then condemns them sillily For having no more Wit than he. SATYR UPON OUR RIDICULOUS IMITATION OF THE FRENCH Who would not rather get him gone Beyond th' intolerablest Zone; Or steer his Passage through those Seas, That burn in Flames, or those that freeze, Than see one Nation go to School, And learn of another, like a Fool? To study all its Tricks and Fashions With epidemic Affectations; And dare to wear no Mode or Dress, But what they, in their Wisdom, please; As Monkies are, by being taught To put on Gloves and Stockings, caught: Submit to all that they devise, As if it wore their Liveries; Make ready and dress th' Imagination, Not with the Cloaths, but with the Fashion; And change it, to fulfil the Curse Of Adam's Fall, for new, though worse; To make their Britches fall and rise From middle Legs to middle Thighs, The Tropics between which the Hose Move always as the Fashion goes: Sometimes wear Hats like Pyramids, And sometimes flat like Pipkin's Lids With broad Brims sometimes like Umbrellas, And sometimes narrow as Punchinello's: In coldest Weather go unbrac't, And close in hot, as if th' were lac't: Sometimes with Sleeves and Bodies wide, And sometimes straiter than a Hide: Wear Peruques, and with false grey Hairs Disguise the true ones, and their Years; That, when they're modish, with the young The old may seem so in the Throng: And as some Pupils have been known, In time to put their Tutors down; So ours are often found t' have got More Tricks, than ever they were taught: With sly Intrigues and Artifices Usurp their Poxes, and their Vices; With Garnitures upon their Shoes, Make good their Claim to gouty Toes; By sudden Starts, and Shrugs, and Groans Pretend to Aches in their Bones, To Scabs and Botches, and lay Trains To prove their Running of the Reins; And, lest they should seem destitute Of any Mange, that's in Repute, And be behind hand with the Mode Will swear to Chrystallin and Node; And, that they may not lose their Right, Make it appear how they came by't: Disdain the Country, where th' were born, As Bastards their own Mothers scorn; And that which brought them forth contemn, As it deserves for bearing them: Admire whate'er they find abroad, But nothing here, though e'er so good. Be Natives wheresoe'er they come, And only Foreigners at home; To which th' appear so far estrang'd, As if th' had been i' th' Cradle chang'd; Or from beyond the Seas convey'd By Witches—not born here, but laid; Or by outlandish fathers were Begotten on their Mothers here, And therefore justly slight that Nation, Where th' have so mungrel a Relation; And seek out other Climates, where They may degenerate less than here; As Woodcocks, when their Plumes are grown, Born on the Winds Wings and their own, Forsake the Countries, where th' are hatcht, And seek out others, to be catcht: So they more nat'rally may please And humor their own Geniuses, Apply to all Things, which they see With their own Fancies best agree; No matter how ridiculous, 'Tis all one, if it be in use; For nothing can be bad or good, But as 'tis in or out of Mode; And as the Nations are that use it, All ought to practise, or refuse it: T' observe their postures, move, and stand As they give out the Word o' Command; To learn the dullest of their Whims And how to wear their very Limbs; To turn and manage every Part, Like Puppets, by their Rules of Art; To shrug discreetly, act, and tread, And politicly shake the Head, Until the Ignorant (that guess At all Things by th' Appearances) To see how Art and Nature strive, Believe them really alive, And that th' are very Men, not Things That move by Puppet-work and Springs; When truly all their Feats have been As well perform'd by Motion-men, And the worst Drols of Punchinellos Were much th' ingeniouser Fellows; For, when they're perfect in their Lesson, Th' Hypothesis grows out of Season, And, all their Labour lost, they're fain To learn new, and begin again: To talk eternally and loud, And altogether in a Crowd, No matter what, for in the Noise No Man minds what another says: T' assume a Confidence beyond Mankind, for solid and profound; And still the less and less they know, The greater Dose of that allow: Decry all Things; for to be wise Is not to know, but to despise, And deep judicious Confidence Has still the Odds of Wit and Sense, And can pretend a Title to Far greater Things than they can do: T' adorn their English with French Scraps, And give their very Language Claps; To Jernie rightly, and renounce I' th' pure and most approv'd of Tones, And, while they idly think t' enrich, Adulterate their native Speech; For though to smatter Ends of Greek, Or Latin be the Rhetorique Of Pedants counted, and vain-glorious, To smatter French is meritorious; And to forget their Mother-Tongue, Or purposely to speak it wrong, A hopeful Sign of Parts and Wit, And that th' improve and benefit; As those, that have been taught amiss In liberal Arts and Sciences, Must all th' had learnt before in vain Forget quite, and begin again. SATYR UPON DRUNKENNESS 'Tis pity Wine, which Nature meant To Man in Kindness to present; And gave him kindly to caress, And cherish his frail Happiness, Of equal Virtue to renew His wearied Mind, and Body too, Should (like the Cyder-tree in Eden, Which only grew, to be forbidden) No sooner come to be enjoy'd, But th' Owner's fatally destroy'd; And that, which she for Good design'd, Becomes the Ruin of Mankind, That for a little vain Excess Runs out of all its Happiness, And makes the Friend of Truth and Love Their greatest Adversary prove; T' abuse a Blessing she bestow'd So truly essential to his Good; To countervail his pensive Cares, And slavish Drudgery of Affairs; To teach him Judgment, Wit, and Sense, And, more than all these, Confidence; To pass his Times of Recreation In choice and noble Conversation, Catch Truth and Reason unawares, As Men do Health in wholesome Airs; (While Fools their Conversants possess As unawares with Sottishness) To gain Access a private Way To Man's best Sense, by his own Key, Which painful Judgers strive in vain By any other Course t' obtain; To pull off all Disguise, and view Things as th' are natural, and true; Discover Fools and Knaves, allow'd For wise and honest in the Crowd; With innocent and virtuous Sport Make short Days long, and long Nights short, And Mirth the only Antidote Against Diseases, ere th' are got; To save Health harmless from th' Access Both of the Med'cine, and Disease; Or make it help itself, secure Against the desperat'st Fit, the Cure. All these sublime Prerogatives Of Happiness to human Lives He vainly throws away, and slights For Madness, Noise, and bloody Fights; When nothing can decide, but Swords And Pots, the Right or Wrong of Words, Like Princes Titles; and he's outed The Justice of his Cause, that's routed. No sooner has a Charge been sounded, With—Son of a Whore, and—damn'd confounded And the bold Signal giv'n, the Lye, But instantly the Bottles fly; Where Cups and Glasses are small Shot, And Cannon-ball a Pewter-pot. That Blood, that's hardly in the Vein, Is now remanded back again; Tho' sprung from Wine of the same Piece, And near a-kin, within Degrees, Strives to commit Assassinations On its own natural Relations; And those Twin-spirits so kind-hearted, That from their Friends so lately parted, No sooner several Ways are gone, But by themselves are set upon, Surpriz'd like Brother against Brother, And put to th' Sword by one another: So much more fierce are civil Wars, Than those between mere Foreigners; And Man himself with Wine possest More savage than the wildest Beast. For Serpents, when they meet to water, Lay by their Poyson and their Nature: And fiercest Creatures, that repair, In thirsty Desarts, to their rare And distant River's Banks to drink, In Love and close Alliance link, And from their Mixture of strange Seeds Produce new, never heard of Breeds, To whom the fiercer Unicorn Begins a large Health with his Horn; As Cuckolds put their Antidotes, When they drink Coffee, into th' Pots. While Man, with raging Drink inflam'd, Is far more savage and untam'd; Supplies his Loss of Wit and Sense With Barbarousness and Insolence; Believes himself, the less he's able The more heroic and formidable; Lays by his Reason in his Bowls, As Turks are said to do their Souls, Until it has so often been Shut out of its Lodging, and let in, At length it never can attain To find the right Way back again; Drinks all his Time away, and prunes The End of 's Life, as Vignerons Cut short the Branches of a Vine, To make it bear more Plenty o' Wine; And that, which Nature did intend T' enlarge his Life, perverts t' its End. So Noah, when he anchor'd safe on The Mountain's Top, his lofty Haven, And all the Passengers, he bore, Were on the new World set ashore, He made it next his chief Design To plant, and propagate a Vine, Which since has overwhelm'd and drown'd Far greater Numbers, on dry Ground, Of wretched Mankind, one by one, Than all the Flood before had done. SATYR UPON MARRIAGE Sure Marriages were never so well fitted, As when to Matrimony Men were committed, Like Thieves, by Justices; and to a Wife Bound, like to good Behaviour, during Life: For then 'twas but a civil Contract made, Between two Partners, that set up a Trade; And if both fail'd, there was no Conscience, Nor Faith invaded, in the strictest Sense; No Canon of the Church, nor Vow was broke, When Men did free their gall'd Necks from the Yoke; But when they tir'd, like other horned Beasts, Might have it taken off, and take their Rests, Without b'ing bound in Duty to shew Cause, Or reckon with divine, or human Laws. For since, what use of Matrimony has been, But to make Galantry a greater Sin? As if there were no Appetite, nor Gust, Below Adultery, in modish Lust; Or no Debauchery were exquisite, Until it has attain'd its perfect Height. For Men do now take Wives to nobler Ends, Not to bear Children, but to bear 'em Friends, Whom nothing can oblige at such a Rate, As these endearing Offices of late. For Men are now grown wise, and understand How to improve their Crimes, as well as Land; And if th' have Issue, make the Infants pay Down for their own Begetting on the Day, The Charges of the Gossiping disburse, And pay beforehand (ere they're born) the Nurse; As he that got a Monster on a Cow, Out of Design of setting up a Show. For why should not the Brats for all account, As well as for the Christ'ning at the Fount, When those that stand for them, lay down the Rate O' th' Banquet and the Priest, in Spoons and Plate? The antient Romans made the State allow, For getting all Men's Children above two: Then married Men to propagate the Breed, Had great Rewards for what they never did, Were privileg'd, and highly honour'd too, For owning what their Friends were fain to do; For, so th' had Children, they regarded not By whom (good Men) or how they were begot. To borrow Wives (like Money) or to lend, Was then the civil Office of a Friend, And he, that made a Scruple in the Case, Was held a miserable Wretch, and base; For when th' had Children by 'em, th' honest Men Return'd 'em to their Husbands back agen. Then for th' Encouragement and Propagation Of such a great Concernment to the Nation, All People were so full of Complacence, And civil Duty to the public Sense, They had no Name t' express a Cuckold then, But that which signify'd all married Men; Nor was the Thing accounted a Disgrace, Unless among the dirty Populace, And no Man understands on what account Less civil Nations after hit upon't: For to be known a Cuckold can be no Dishonour, but to him that thinks it so; For, if he feel no Shagrin, or Remorse, His Forehead's shot-free, and he's ne'er the worse, For Horns (like horny Calluses) are found To grow on Sculls, that have receiv'd a Wound, Are crackt, and broken; not at all on those That are invulnerate, and free from Blows. What a brave Time had Cuckold-makers then, When they were held the worthiest of Men, The real Fathers of the Commonwealth, That planted Colonies in Rome itself? When he, that help'd his Neighbours, and begot Most Romans, was the noblest Patriot. For, if a brave Man, that preserv'd from Death One Citizen, was honour'd with a Wreath; He, that more gallantly got three or four, In Reason must deserve a great deal more. Then, if those glorious Worthies of old Rome, That civiliz'd the World th' had overcome, And taught it Laws and Learning, found this Way The best to save their Empire from Decay; Why should not these, that borrow all the Worth They have from them, not take this Lesson forth, Get Children, Friends, and Honour too, and Money By prudent managing of Matrimony? For, if 'tis honourable by all confest, Adultery must be worshipful at least; And these Times great, when private Men are come Up to the Height and Politic of Rome. All By-blows were not only free-born then, But like John Lilborn, free-begotten Men; Had equal Right and Privilege with these, That claim by Title of the four Seas. For being in Marri'ge born, it matters not, After what Liturgy they were begot; And if there be a Difference, they have Th' Advantage of the Chance in proving brave, By b'ing engender'd with more Life and Force, Than those begotten the dull Way of Course. The Chinese place all Piety and Zeal, In serving with their Wives the Commonweal, Fix all their Hopes of Merit, and Salvation, Upon their Women's Supererogation, With solemn Vows their Wives and Daughters bind, Like Eve in Paradise, to all Mankind; And those, that can produce the most Gallants, Are held the pretiousest of all their Saints, Wear Rosaries about their Necks to con Their Exercise of Devotion on; That serve them for Certificates to show, With what vast Numbers they have had to do: Before th' are marry'd, make a Conscience T' omit no Duty of Incontinence; And she, that has been oftenest prostituted, Is worthy of the greatest Match reputed. But, when the conqu'ring Tartar went about To root this orthodox Religion out, They stood for Conscience, and resolv'd to dye, Rather than change the antient Purity Of that Religion, which their Ancestors, And they had prosper'd in so many Years; Vow'd to their Gods to sacrifice their Lives; And dye their Daughters Martyrs, and their Wives, Before they would commit so great a Sin Against the Faith they had been bred up in. UPON CRITICS Who judge of MODERN PLAYS Precisely by the RULES of the ANTIENTS Who ever wil Regard Poetique Fury, When it is once found Idiot by a Jury? And evry Peart, and Arbitrary Fool Can all Poetique Licence over-Rule? Assume a Barbrous Tyranny, to Handle The Muses, worse then Ostro-goth, or Vandal? Make 'em submit to verdict and Report And stand (or Fall) to th' orders of a Court. Much lesse, Be sentenc'd by the Arbitra[r]y Proceedings of a witless Plagiary That forge's old Records, and Ordinances Against the Right and Property of Fancys More False, and Nice, then weighing of the weather To th' Hundredth Atom, of the lightest Feather, Or measuring of Aire upon Pernassus With Cilinders of Torricellian Glasses; Reduce all Tragedy by Rules of Art Back, to its Antique Theater, a Cart, And make 'em hence forth keep the beaten Roades Of Reverend Choruses, and Episodes; Reforme and Regulate a Puppet-Play According to the tru and antient way: That not an Actor shal Presume to Squeek Unless he hav a Licence for't, in Greek; Nor Whittington Henceforward, sel his Cat in Plaine vulgar English, without Mewing Latin: No Pudding shalbe sufferd to be witty Unles it be in Order to Raise Pitty; Nor Devil in the Puppet-play, b' allowd To Rore and Spit fire, but to fright the Crowd, Unless some God, or Dev'l chance t' have Piques Against an Antient Family of Greeks; Others may have Leave to tremble, and take warning, How such a Fatal Progeny th' are Born in. For none but such for Tragedy are fitted That have been Ruind only to be Pittyd; And only those held Proper to Deterre Wh' have had th' Il Luck, against their wils to erre. Whence only such as are of Midling Sizes Between Morality and venial vices Are Qualifyd to be Destroyd by Fate For other Mortals to take warning at. As if the Antique Laws of Tragedy Did with our own Municipall agree And servd like Cobwebs but t' insnare the weake And give Diversion to the Great to break; To make a lesse Delinquent to be brought To Answer for a Greater Persons Fault And suffer all the worst, the worst Approver Can, to excuse, and save himself, Discover. No longer shal Dramatiques be confind To draw tru Images, of al Mankinde, To Punish in Effigie Criminals, Reprieve the Innocent, and hang the False; But a Club-Law [to] execute, and kill, For nothing, whom so ere they Please, at will: To terrify Spectators from committing The Crimes, they did, and sufferd for, unwitting. These are the Reformations of the Stage, Like other Reformations of the Age: On Purpose to Destroy all wit and sense As th' other did all Law, and Conscience. No better then the Laws of British Plays Confirmd in th' Antient good King Howels Days Who made a Gen'ral Councel Regulate Mens catching women by the—you know what, And set down in the Rubrick, at what time It should be counted Legal, when a Crime; Declare when 'twas, and when 'twas not a sin And on what days it went out, or came in. An English Poet should be tryd b' his Peres And not by Pedants, and Philosophers Incompetent to Judge Poetique Fury, As Butchers are forbid to b' of a Jury; Beside the most Intollerable wrong To try their Matter in a Forrain Tongue By Forrain Jury men, like Sophocles Or Tales falser then Euripides; When not an English Native dares appear To be a witnes for the Prisoner, When all the Laws they use t' Arraigne, and try The Innocent and wrongd Delinquent by Were made b' a Forraine Laweyer and his Pupils To put an End to all Poetique Scruples, And by th' Advice of Virtuosi-Tuscans Determind al the Doubts of Socks and Buskins; Gave Judgment on all Past and Future Plays, As is Apparent by Speronys Case, Which Lope Vega first began to steale, And after him the French Filou Corniele; And since our English Plagiarys Nim And steal their farfet Criticismes, from him, And, by an Action falsly layd of Trover, The Lumber, for their Proper Goods Recover; Enough to furnish al the Lewd Impeachers Of witty Beumonts Poetry, and Fletchers, Who, for a few Misprisions of wit, Are chargd by those, who ten times worse commit; And for Misjudging some unhappy scenes Are censurd for't, with more unlucky sense; When all their worst miscarriages Delight And please more then the Best, that Pedants write. SATYR UPON PLAGIARIES Why should the World be so averse To Plagiary Privateers, That all Mens Sense and Fancy seize, And make free Prize of what they please? As if, because they huff and swell, Like Pilferers full of what they steal, Others might equal Pow'r assume, To pay 'em with as hard a Doom; To shut them up, like Beasts in Pounds, For breaking into others Grounds; Mark 'em with Characters and Brands, Like other Forgers of Mens Hands; And in Effigie hand and draw The poor Delinquents by Club-Law; When no Inditement justly lies, But where the Theft will bear a Price. For though Wit never can be learn'd It may b' assum'd and own'd, and earn'd; And, like our noblest Fruits, improv'd, By b'ing transplanted and remov'd: And as it bears no certain Rate, Nor pays one Peny to the State, With which it turns no more t' account Than Virtue, Faith, and Merit's wont; Is neither Moveable, nor Rent, Nor Chattel, Goods, nor Tenement; Nor was it ever pass'd b' Entail, Nor settled upon Heirs Male; Or if it were, like ill-got Land, Did never fall t' a second Hand; So 'tis no more to be engross'd, Than Sun-shine, or the Air inclos'd; Or to Propriety confin'd, Than th' uncontrol'd and scatter'd Wind. For why should that which Nature meant To owe its Being to its Vent; That has no Value of its own, But as it is divulg'd and known; Is perishable and destroy'd, As long as it lies unenjoy'd, Be scanted of that lib'ral Use, Which all Mankind is free to choose, And idly hoarded, where 'twas bred, Instead of being dispers'd and spread? And the more lavish and profuse, 'Tis of the nobler general Use; As Riots, though supply'd by Stealth, Are wholesome to the Commonwealth; And Men spend freelier what they win, Than what th' have freely coming in. The World's as full of curious Wit, Which those, that father, never writ, As 'tis of Bastards, which the Sot And Cuckold owns, that ne'er begot; Yet pass as well, as if the one And th' other By-blow were their own. For why should he that's impotent To judge, and fancy, and invent, For that Impediment be stopt To own, and challenge, and adopt, At least th' expos'd, and fatherless Poor Orphans of the Pen, and Press, Whose Parents are obscure, or dead, Or in far Countries born and bred. As none but Kings have Pow'r to raise A Levy, which the Subject pays; And, though they call that Tax a Loan, Yet, when 'tis gather'd, 'tis their own: So he, that's able to impose A Wit-excise on Verse or Prose; And, still the abler Authors are, Can make them pay the greater Share, Is Prince of Poets of his Time, And they his Vassals, that supply him; Can judge more justly of what he takes Than any of the best he makes; And more impartially conceive What's fit to chuse, and what to leave. For Men reflect more strictly upon The sense of others, than their own; And Wit, that's made of Wit and Slight, Is richer than the plain downright: As Salt, that's made of Salt's more fine, Than when it first came from the Brine; And Spirits of a nobler Nature, Drawn from the dull ingredient Matter. Hence mighty Virgil's said of old, From Dung to have extracted Gold; (As many a Lout and silly Clown, By his Instructions since has done) And grew more lofty by that means, Than by his Livery Oats and Beans; When from his Carts and Country Farms He rose a mighty Man at Arms; To whom th' Heroics ever since Have sworn Allegiance as their Prince, And faithfully have in all Times Observ'd his Customs in their Rhimes. 'Twas counted Learning once and Wit To void but what some Author writ; And what Men understood by rote By as implicit Sense to quote. Then many a magisterial Clerk Was taught, like singing Birds i' th' Dark; And understood as much of Things, As th' ablest Blackbird what it sings; And yet was honour'd and renown'd, For grave, and solid, and profound. Then why should those, who pick and choose The best of all the best compose, And join it by Mosaic Art, In graceful Order, Part to Part, To make the whole in Beauty suit, Not Merit as compleat Repute As those, who with less Art and Pains Can do it with their native Brains, And make the home-spun Business fit As freely with their Mother Wit? Since what by Nature was deny'd By Art and Industry's supply'd, Both which are more our own, and brave Than all the Alms, that Nature gave. For what w' acquire by Pains and Art Is only due t' our own Desert; While all th' Endowments she confers, Are not so much our own, as hers, That, like good Fortune, unawares Fall not t' our Virtue, but our Shares; And all we can pretend to merit, We do not purchase, but inherit. Thus all the great'st Inventions, when They first were found out, were so mean, That th' Authors of them are unknown, As little things they scorn'd to own; Until by Men of nobler Thought Th' were to their full Perfection brought. This proves that Wit does but rough-hew, Leaves Art to polish, and review; And that a Wit at second Hand Has greatest Int'rest and Command: For to improve, dispose, and judge Is nobler than t' invent, and drudge. Invention's humorous and nice, And never at Command applies; Disdains t' obey the proudest Wit, Unless it chance to b' in the Fit; (Like Prophecy, that can presage Successes of the latest Age, Yet is not able to tell when It next shall prophecy agen) Makes all her Suitors course and wait Like a proud Minister of State, And, when she's serious in some Freak, Extravagant, and vain, and weak, Attend her silly, lazy Pleasure, Until she chance to be at leisure: When 'tis more easy to steal Wit; To clip, and forge, and counterfeit, Is both the Business and Delight, Like hunting Sports, of those that write; For Thievery is but one Sort, The Learned say, of hunting Sport. Hence 'tis, that some, who set up first As raw, and wretched, and unverst; And open'd with a Stock as poor, As a healthy Beggar with one Sore; That never writ in Prose or Verse, But pick'd, or cut it, like a Purse; And at the best could but commit The Petty-Larceny of Wit; To whom to write was to purloin, And printing but to stamp false Coin; Yet after long and sturdy 'ndeavours Of being painful Wit-receivers, With gath'ring Rags and Scraps of Wit, As Paper's made, on which 'tis writ, Have gone forth Authors, and acquir'd The right—or wrong to be admir'd; And arm'd with Confidence incurr'd The Fool's good Luck, to be preferr'd. For as a Banker can dispose Of greater Sums, he only owes, Than he, who honestly is known To deal in nothing but his own: So whose'er can take up most, May greatest Fame and Credit Boast. SATYR UPON THE IMPERFECTION AND ABUSE OF HUMAN LEARNING PART 1ST It is the Noblest Act of Human Reason, To Free it selfe, from Slavish Prepossession, Assume the Legall Right to Disingage, From all, it had Contracted under Age: And not its Ingenuity, and wit, To all it was Imbu'd with first, submit, Take Tru, or False, For Better, or for worse: To Have, or t' Hold, indifferently, of Course. For Custom, though but Usher of the Schoole Where Nature breede's the Body up, and Soul, Usurpe's a Greater Pow'r, and Interest, O're Man, the Heir of Reason, then Brute Beast; That by two Different Instincts is Led, Born to the one and by the other Bred. And Traine's him up, with Rudiments more False Then Nature do's, her Stupid Animals. And that's one Reason, why more Care's bestowd Upon the body, then the Soule's allow'd: That is not found to understand, and know, So Subtly as the Body's found to Grow. Though Children, without Study, Paines, or thought, Are Languages, and vulgar Notions taught: Improve their Nat'ral Talents without Care, And Apprehend, before they are aware: Yet as all Strangers never leave the Tones, They have been usd of children to Pronounce, So most Mens Reason never can outgrow The Discipline, it first Receiv'd to know But render words, they first began to con, The End of all that's after to be known; And set the Helps of Education back, Worse then (without it) Man could ever lack. Who therefor, finde's, The Artificialst Fooles Have not been changd i' th' Cradle but the Schooles: Where Error, Pædantry, and Affectation Run them, behind Hand, with their Education. And all alike are taught Poetique Rage When Hardly one's fit for it, in an Age. No sooner are the Organs of the Braine Quick to Receive, and stedfast to Retaine Best knowledges; But All's layd out upon Retriving of the Curse of Babilon, To make Confounded Languages Restore A Greater Drudgery, then it Bard before. And therefor those Imported from the East, Where first the[y] were Incurd, are held the Best, Although conveyd in worse Arabian Pothookes Then Gifted Tradsmen Scratch in Sermon Notebooks; Are Really but Paines, and Labour lost And not worth half the Drudgery they cost, Unles, like Raritys, as th' have been brought From foraine Climats, and as Dearly bought; When those who had no other but their own Have all Succeeding Eloquence outdon; As Men that wink with one eie see more tru And take their Aime much better then with two. For the more Languages a man can speake, His Talent has but sprung the Greater Leak: And for the Industry, H' has spent upon't, Must ful as much some other way Discount. The Hebrew, Chalde, and the Syriac Do (like their Letters) set mens Reason back: And turn's their wits, that strive to understand it, (Like those that write the Character[s],) Left-Handed. Yet He that is but able to express No Sense at all, in Severall Languages, Will Pass for Learneder, then Hee that's known To Speake the Strongest Reason, in but one. These are the modern Arts of Education With all the Learned of Mankind in Fashion, But Practicd only with the Rod and whip, As Riding Schools inculcate Horsmanship Or Romish Penitents let out their Skins To beare the Penaltys of others Sins. When Letters at the first were meant for Play And only usd to Passe the time away: When th' Ancient Greeks, and Romans had no name T' express a Schoole, and Play-hous, but the same; And in their Languages so long agone, To study or be Idle, was all one. For nothing more Preserv's men in their wits, Then giving of them, leave to Play by fits, In Dreames to sport, and Ramble with all Fancies, And waking, little less Extravagancies: The Rest, and Recreation of tyr'd Thought, When 'tis Run down with Care, and overwrought: Of which, who ever do's not freely take His Constant Share, is never Broad awake, And when he wants an equal Competence Of both Recruits, Abates as much of Sense. Nor is their Education worse design'd, Then Nature (in her Province) Prove's unkind. The Greatest Inclinations, with the least Capacitys, are Fatally Possest, Condemnd to Drudge, and Labour, and take Paines, Without an equal Competence of Braines: While those she has Indulgd in Soul, and Body, Are most averse to Industry, and Study. And th' Activst Fancies share as loose Alloys, For want of Equal weight to Counterpoyse: But when those Great conveniences meet, Of equal Judgment, Industry, and wit; The one but strives the other to Divert: While Fate, and Custom, in the Feud take Part And Schollers by Prepostrous over doing, And under-Judging, All their Projects Ruine: Who, though the understanding of Mankind Within so streit a Cumpasse is confin'd, Disdain the Limits Nature set's to Bound The wit of Man, and vainly Rove beyond. When Bravest Souldiers scorn, until th' are got Close to the Enemy, to mak[e] a Shot, Yet Great Philosophers delight to stretch Their Talents most, at things beyond their Reach: And Proudly think t' unriddle ev'ry Cause That Nature use's, by their own By-laws When 'tis not only Impertinent, but Rude, When she deny's Admission, to intrude: And, all their Industry is but to Erre Unless they have free Quarentine from her: Whence 'tis, the World the less has understood By striving to know more, then 'tis allow'd. For Adam with the Loss of Paradise Bought knowledg at too Desperate a Price; And ever since that Miserable Fate Learning did never Cost an Easier Rate: For though the most Divine, and Sovraine Good That Nature has upon Mankind bestowd, Yet it has Prov'd a Greater Hinderance To th' Interests of Truth then Ignorance, And therefore never Bore so high a valew As when it was Contemptible and shallow, Had Academy[s], Schooles, and Colledges, Endowd for its Improvment, and Increase: With Pomp, and Shew, was introduced with Maces, More than a Roman Magistrate, had Fasces; Impowrd with Statute, Privilege, and Mandate, T' assume an Art, and after understand it, Like Bills of Store, for taking a Degree, With all the Learning to it, Custome-free, And own Professions, which they never took So much Delight in, as to Read one Book: Like Princes had Prerogative to Give Convicted Malefactors, a Reprive. And having but a little Paultry wit More then the world, Reduct, and Govern'd it: But Scornd, as soon as 'twas but understood, As Better is a Spightful fo to Good. And now has nothing left for its Support, But what the Darkest times Provided for't. Man has a natural Desire to know, But th' one Half, is for Intrest, Th' other show, As Scrivners take more Paines to learn the Slight Of making knots, then all the Hands they write. So all his Study is not to Extend The Bounds of Knowledg, but some vainer End; T' appeare and Pass for Learned, though his Clame Will Hardly Reach beyond the Empty Name. For most of those that Drudg, and Labour Hard Furnish their understandings by the yard As a French Library by th' whole is, So much an Ell, for Quartos, and for Folios, To which they are but Indexes themselvs, And understand no further then the shelvs, But smatter with their Titles, and Editions And Place them, in their Classical Partitions: When all a Student know's of what he Read's Is not in 's own, but under Gen'rall Heads Of Common Places, not in his own Powr, But like a Dutchmans Money, i' th' Cantore, Where all he can make of it, at the Best, Is hardly three Per Cent, for Interest: And whether he wil ever get it out, Into his own Possession, is a Doubt. Affect's all Books of Past, and modern Ages, But Read's no further then the Title Pages, Only to con the Authors Names by Rote, Or at the Best, those of the Books they wrot. Enough to challenge Intimate Acquaintance, With all the Learned Moderns, and the Antients. As Roman Noble men were wont to Greet And complement the Rabble in the Street: Had Nomenclators in their Traines to clame Acquaintance, with the Meanest, by his Name; And by so cheap, contemptible, a Bribe Trepand the Suffrages, of every Tribe. So learned Men, by Authors Names unknown, Have Gaind no smal Improvement to their own. For He's esteemd the Learnedst of all others, That has the Largest Catalogue of Authors. FRAGMENTS of an intended SECOND PART of the foregoing SATYR [Mens] Talents Grow more Bold and Confident, The further th' are beyond their Just Extent. As Smattrers Prove more Arrogant and Peart The less they truly understand an Art; And, where th' ave least Capacity to doubt, Are wont t' appeare more Peremptory, and Stout; While those that Know the Mathematique Lines Where Nature all the wit of Man Confines, And when it keep's within it's Bounds, and where It Act's beyond the Limits of it's Sphere, Injoy an Absoluter free Command O're all they have a Right to understand, Then those that falsly venture to Incroach Where Nature has denyd the[m] all Approach; And still the more they strive to understand, Like Great Estates, run furthest Behinde Hand; Will undertake the Univers to Fathom, From Infinite, down to a Single Atom, Without a Geometrique Instrument, To take their own Capacity's Extent; Can tell as Easy how the world was made As if they had been brought up to the Trade, And whether Chance, Necessity, or Matter Contrivd the whole œconomy of Nature; When all their Wits to understand the World Can never tell why a Pigs Tayle is Curld Or give a Rational Accompt, why Fish That always use to Drink, do never Pisse. What Mad Phantastique Gambols have been P[l]ayd By th' antique Greek Forefathers of the Trade? That were not much Inferior to the Freaks Of all our Lunatique, Fanatique Sects: The First and Best Philosopher of Athens, Was Crackt, and Ran stark-staring mad with Patience; And had no other way to shew his wit, But when his Wife was in her Scolding Fit: Was after in the Pagan Inquisition, And sufferd Martyrdom for no Religion. Next him, his Scholler striving to Expell All Poets, his Poetique Common-weal, Exild himself, and al his Followers, Notorious Poets only Bating verse. The Stagyrite, unable to Expound The Euripus, leapt int' it, and was Drownd: So he, that put his Eies out, to Consider, And Contemplate on Natural things, the steadier: Did but himself for Idiot convince, Tho Reverenct by the Learned ever since. Empedocles, to be esteemd a God, Leapt into Ætna with [his] Sandals shod, That b'ing blown out, discoverd what an Ass, The Great Philosopher, and Jugler was, That to his own New Deity sacrifict And was himself the victime, and the Priest. The Cynique coynd False Money, and for feare Of being Hangd for't, turnd Philosopher: Yet with his Lanthorn went by Day to finde One Honest Man in th' Heap of all Mankind; An Idle Freak, he needed not have don, If he had known himself to be but one. With swarms of Magots of the self-same Rate, The Learned of all Ages celebrate: Things that are properer for Knights-bridg-Colledge, Then th' Authors, and Originals of Knowledg; More Sottish then the two Fanatiques trying To mend the World, by Laughing or by Crying: Or he, that laughd until he chokd his whistle, To Rally on an Ass, that eate a Thistle. That th' Antique Sage, who was Gallant t' a Goose A Fitter Mistres could not Pick and Chuse Whose Tempers, Inclinations, Sense, and wit Like two Indentures, did agree so fit. The Antient Sceptiques constantly Denyd, What they maintaind, and thought they Justifyd: For when Th' Affirmd, That Nothing's to be known, They did but what they sayd, before, Disowne: And, [like] Polemiques of the Post, Pronounce The same things, to be true, and False at once. These Follies had such Influence on the Rabble, As to Ingage them in Perpetual Squabble; Divided Rome, And Athens, into clans Of Ignorant Mechanique Partizans: That to maintaine their Own Hypotheses, Broke one anothers Block-heads, and the Peace. Were often set by Officers i' th' Stocks For Quarrelling about a Paradox, When Pudding-wives were launchd in cockquen stooles, For Falling-foul on Oyster-womens Schooles: No Herb-women sold Cabbages, or Inions But to their Gossips of their own Opinions, A Peripatetique Cobler scornd to sole A Pair of Shoos of any other Schoole And Porters of the Judgment of the Stoiques To go on Errand of the Cyrenaiques, That us'd t'encounter in Athletique Lists With Beard to Beard and Teeth and Nailes to Fists: Like modern Kicks, and Cufs among the Youth Of Academiques, to maintaine the Truth: But, in the Boldest Feates of Arms, the Stoique, And Epicureans, were the most Heroique, That stoutly venturd breaking of their Necks, To vindicate the Intrests of their Sects. And stil behavd themselves as Resolute In waging Cuffs, and Bruises, as Dispute, Until with wounds, and Bruises, which th' had got, Some Hundred were kild Dead, upon the Spot: When al their Quarrels (rightly understood) Were but to prove Disputes, the Sovrain Good. Distinctions, that had been at first Design'd To Regulate the Errors of the Minde, By b'ing too Nicely over-straind, and vext, Have made the Comment, harder then the Text; And do not now (like Carving) hit the Joynt, But break the Bones, in Pieces, of a Poynt: And with Impertinent Evasions, force The Clearest Reason, from it's Native Course— That argue things s' uncertaine, 'tis no Matter Whether they are, or never were in Nature, And venture to Demonstrate when th' are slurd And Palmd, a Fallacy upon a Word. For Disputants (As Sword-men use to fence, With Blunted Foyles) Dispute with Blunted Sense, And as th' [are] wont to Falsify a Blow, Use nothing else to Pass upon the Foe. Or if they venture further to attack, Like Bowlers, strive to Beat away the Jack: And when they finde themselves, too hardly Prest-on, Prævaricate, and change the State o' th' Question, The Noblest Science of Defence, and Art, In Practice now with all that Controvert; And th' only Mode of Prizes, from Bear-garden Down to the Schooles, in giving Blows, or warding. As old Knights Errant in their Harnes fought As Safe as in a Castle, or Redout, Gave one another Desperat Attaques To storme the Counter Scarps upon their Backs, So Disputants Advance, and Post their Armes To storm the works of one anothers Tearms, Fall Foul on some extravagant Expression But nere Attempt the maine Designe and Reason— So some Polemiques, use to Draw their Swords Against the Language only, and the words; As He, who fought at Barriers with Salmasius Ingagd with nothing but his Style, and Phrases, Wav'd to assert the Murther of a Prince, The Author of False Latin to Convince; But Layd the Merits of the Cause aside, By those who understood 'em to be try'd; And counted Breaking Priscians Head a thing More Capital then to behead a King, For which H' has been admir'd by all the Learnd Or Knavs concernd, and Pedants unconcern'd. Judgement is but a Curious Pair of Scales, That turn's with th' Hundredth Part of True, or False And still the more 'tis usd, is wont, t' abate The Subtlety, and Nicenes of it's weight. Untill 'tis False, and will not Rise, nor Fall; Like those that are less Artificiall, And therefore Students, in their way of Judging, Are faine to swallow many a Senseles Gudgeon: And by their over-underst[and]ing loose Its Active Faculty with too much use. For Reason, when too Curiously 'tis Spun, Is but the next of all Removd from none: It is Opinion governs all Mankind As wisely as the Blinde, that leads the Blinde: For as those Sur-names are Esteemd the Best That signify, in all things else, the Least, So men Pass fairest in the worlds Opinion, That have the least of Truth and Reason in 'em. Truth would undo the world, if it Possest The Meanest of its Right, and Interest. Is but a titular Princes, whose Authority Is always under-age, and in Minority; Has al things don, and carryd in her Name, But most of all, where she can lay no Clame. As far from Gayety, and Complesance, As Greatness, Pride, Ambition, Ignorance. And therefore has surrenderd her Dominion Ore all Mankind, to barbarous opinion. That in her Right, usurps the Tyrannys And Arbitrary Government of Lyes— As no Tricks on the Rope, but those that Break Or come most Near to breaking of a Neck Are worth the Sight: so nothing Go's for wit, But Nonsense, or the next of al to it. For Nonsense being neither False, nor tru, A Little wit to any thing may Screw. And when it has a while been usd of Course Wil stand as well in virtu, Powr and Force And Pass for Sense t' all Purposes as good As if it had at first been understood. For Nonsense, has the Amplest Priviledges And more then all the Strongest Sense, oblige's. That furnishes the Schools, with Tearms of Art The Mysterys of Science, to Impart. Supplys all Seminarys, with Recruites Of endless Controversys, and Disputes, For Learned Nonsense has a Deeper Sound Then Easy Sense, and go's for more Profound. The greatest writers commonly Compile, At Charge of Nothing, but the words and Style. And all the Nicest Critiques of the Learnd Believe themselves in Nothing else concernd. For as it is the Garniture and Dress That all things weare in Books and Languages And all Mens Qualitis are wont t' appeare According to the Habits that they weare, 'Tis Probable to be the Fittest Test, Of all the ingenuity o' th' Rest: The Lives of Trees Ly chiefly in their Barks, And all the wit i' th' Styles of Learned Clerks, Hence 'twas, the Antient Roman Politicians Went to the Schooles of Forrain Rhetoricians To learn the Art of Patrons (in Defence Of Intrest, and their Clients) Eloquence: When Consuls, Censors, Senators, and Prætors, With great Dictators, usd t' apply to Rhetors: To heare the Greater Magistrate, o' th' School, Give Sentence in his Haughty Chair-Curule. And those who Mighty Nations over-came, Were fain to say their Lessons, and declame. Words are but Pictures, tru or False Designd To Draw the Lines, and Features of the Minde, The Characters and artificial Draughts T' express the inward Images of thoughts; And Artists say a Picture may be good Altho the Moral be not understood; Whence some Infer, They may Admire a Style, Though all the Rest be ere so Mean and vile: Applaud th' outsides of words, but never minde, With what Fantastique Taudery th' are Lyn'd. So Orators, Inchanted with the Twang Of their own Trillos, take Delight t' Harangue; Whose Science, like a Juglers Box, and Balls Convey's, and Counterchanges Tru, and False. Cast's Mists before their Audiences eies, To Pass the one, for th' other in Disguise: And like a Morice-Dancer drest with Bells, Only to serve for Noyse, and Nothing else, Such as a Carryer make's his Cattle weare And Hang's for Pendents in a Horses Eare: For if the Style and Language beare the Test, No matter what become's, of all the Rest: The Ablest orator, to save a word, Would throw all Sense, and Reason, over boord. Hence 'tis that nothing else, but Eloquence, Is tyd to such a Prodigal Expence; That Lay's out Halfe the wit, and Sense it uses Upon the other halfes, as vain excuses. For all Defences, and Apologies, Are but Specifique's, t' other Frauds and Lies; And th' Artificiall wash of Eloquence, Is dawbd in vaine, upon the Clearest Sense. Only to staine the Native Ingenuity, Of æqual Brevity, and Perspicuity. While all the Best, and Sobrest, Feats he does; Are when he Coughs, or Spits, or Blows his Nose, Handles no Poynt, so evident, and cleare (Beside his white Gloves) as his Handkercher; Unfold's the Nicest Scruple, so Distinct, As if his Talent had been wrapd-up in't (Unthriftily) and now he went about Henceforward to Improve, and put it out. For Pædants are a Mungrel Breed that Sojorn Among the Ancient writers, and the modern; And while their studys are between the one, And th' other spent, have nothing of their own; Like Spunges, are both Plants, and Animals And equally to both their Natures false. For whether 'tis their want of Conversation, Inclines them to al Sorts of Affectation: Their Sedentary Life, and Melancholy, The Everlasting Nursery of Folly; Their Poring upon Black and White too subtly Has turnd the Insides of their Brains to Motly, Or squandring of their wits, and time, upon Too many things, has made them fit for none, Their Constant over-straining of the minde Distort[s] the Braine, as Horses break their winde; Or Rude Confusions of the things they Read Get up like noxious vapours in th[e] Head, Untill they have their Constant wanes, and Fuls And Changes, in the Insides of their Skuls; Or venturing beyond the reach of wit Had rendred them for al things else unfit; But never bring the world and Books together And therefore never Rightly Judg of either; Whence multitudes of Revrend men and Critiques Have got a kinde of Intellectual Riquets, And by th' Immoderate Excess of Study Have found the Sickly Head t' outgrow the Body. For Pedantry is but a Corn, or wart Bred in the Skin of Judgment, Sense, and Art, A Stupifyd Excrescence, like a Wen Fed by the Peccant Humors of Learnd Men, That never Grows from Natural Defects Of Downright and untutord Intellects, But from the over curious and vain Distempers of an Artificial Brain— So Hee that once stood for the Learnedst man, Had Read-out Little-Britain, and Duck-Lane, Worn out his Reason, and Reducd his Body And Brain to nothing, with Perpetual Study: Kept Tutors of all Sorts, and virtuosos, To Read all Authors to him, with their Glosses, And made his Laqueis (when he walkd) Beare Folios Of Dictionarys, Lexicons, and Scolios To be Read to him evry way, the winde Should chance to sit before him, or Behind: Had read out all the imaginary Duels That had been fou[gh]t by Consonants and vowel[s]; Had Crackt his Scul, to find out Proper-Places, To lay up all Memoires of things in Cases, And Practicd all the Tricks upon the Carts To Play with Packs of Sciences and Arts, That serve t' improve a Feeble Gamsters Study That venture's at Grammatique Beast, or Noddy; Had Read-out all the Catalogues of wares That come in Dry fats o're, from Francfort-faires, Whose Authors use t' articulate their Surnames With Scraps of Greek, more Learned then the Germans: Was wont to scatter Books in evry Roome Where they might best bee seen, by all that come, And lay a Train, that natrally should force What he designd, as if it fel of Course. And all this; with a worse Success then Cardan, Who bought both Bookes and Learning at a Bargain When lighting on a Philosophique Spel, Of which he never Knew one Syllable, Presto be gone! H' unriddled all he Read As if he had to nothing else been Bred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PINDARIC ODES UPON AN HYPOCRITICAL NONCONFORMIST I There's nothing so absurd, or vain, Or barbarous, or inhumane, But if it lay the least Pretence To Piety and Godliness, Or tender-hearted Conscience; And Zeal for Gospel-Truths profess, Does sacred instantly commence; And all, that dare but question it, are strait Pronounc'd th' Uncircumcis'd, and Reprobate: As Malefactors, that escape, and fly Into a Sanctuary for Defence, Must not be brought to Justice thence, Although their Crimes be ne'er so great and high; And he, that dares presume to do't, Is sentenc'd and deliver'd up To Satan, that engag'd him to't, For vent'ring wickedly to put a Stop To his Immunities and free Affairs, Or meddle saucily with theirs, That are employ'd by him; while he and they Proceed in a religious and a holy Way. II And as the Pagans heretofore Did their own Handyworks adore, And made their Stone and Timber Deities, Their Temples, and their Altars of one Piece, The same Outgoings seem t' inspire Our modern self-will'd Edifier, That out of Things as far from Sense, and more, Contrives new Light and Revelation, The Creatures of th' Imagination, To worship and fall down before; Of which his crack'd Delusions draw As monstrous Images and rude, As ever Pagan, to believe in, hew'd; Or Madman in a Vision saw; Mistakes the feeble Impotence, And vain Delusions of his Mind, For spiritual Gifts and Offerings, Which Heaven, to present him, brings; And still, the further 'tis from Sense, Believes it is the more refin'd, And ought to be receiv'd with greater Reverence. III But as all Tricks, whose Principles Are false, prove false in all Things else, The dull and heavy Hypocrite Is but in Pension with his Conscience, That pays him for maintaining it With zealous Rage and Impudence, And as the one grows obstinate, So does the other rich and fat; Disposes of his Gifts and Dispensations, Like spiritual Foundations, Endow'd to pious Uses, and design'd To entertain the Weak, the Lame, and Blind, But still diverts them to as bad, or worse, Than others are by unjust Governors: For, like our modern Publicans, He still puts out all Dues, He owes to Heaven, to the Devil to use, And makes his godly Interest great Gains; Takes all, the brethren (to recruit The Spirit in him) contribute And, to repair and edify his spent And broken-winded outward Man, present For painful holding forth against the Government. IV The subtle Spider never spins, But on dark Days, his slimy Gins; Nor does our Engineer much care to plant His spiritual Machines, Unless among the Weak and Ignorant, Th' Inconstant, Credulous, and Light, The Vain, the Factious, and the Slight, That in their Zeal are most extravagant: For Trouts are tickled best in muddy Water; And still the muddier he finds their Brains, The more he's sought, and follow'd after; And greater Ministrations gains; For talking idly is admir'd, And speaking Nonsense held inspir'd; And still, the flatter and more dull His Gifts appear, is held more powerful: For Blocks are better cleft with Wedges, Than Tools of sharp and subtle Edges; And dullest Nonsense has been found By some to be the solid'st, and the most profound. V A great Apostle once was said With too much Learning to be mad; But our great Saint becomes distract, And only with too little crackt; Crys moral Truths and human Learning down, And will endure no Reason, but his own. For 'tis a Drudgery and Task, Not for a Saint, but Pagan Oracle, To answer all Men can object, or ask; But to be found impregnable, And with a sturdy Forehead to hold out, In spight of Shame or Reason resolute, Is braver than to argue and confute. As he, that can draw Blood, they say, From Witches, takes their magic Pow'r away: So he, that draws Blood int' a Brother's Face, Takes all his Gifts away, and Light, and Grace. For while he holds, that nothing is so damn'd And shameful, as to be asham'd, He never can b' attack'd, But will come off; for Confidence well back'd, Among the weak and prepossest, Has often Truth with all her Kingly Pow'r opprest. VI It is the Nature of late Zeal, 'Twill not be subject, nor rebel, Nor left at large, nor be restrain'd, But where there's something to be gain'd; And that b'ing once reveal'd defies The Law with all its Penalties; And is convinc'd, no Pale O' th' Church can be so sacred as a Jail. For as the Indians Prisons are their Mines; So he has found are all Restraints To thriving and free-conscienc'd Saints; For the same Thing enriches that confines; And, like to Lully, when he was in hold, He turns his baser Mettals into Gold; Receives returning and retiring Fees For holding-forth, and holding of his Peace, And takes a Pension to be Advocate, And standing Counsel 'gainst the Church and State For gall'd and tender Consciences; Commits himself to Prison, to trepan, Draw in, and spirit all he can; For Birds in Cages have a Call, To draw the wildest into Nets, More prevalent and natural, Than all our artificial Pipes and Counterfeits. VII His slipp'ry Conscience has more Tricks Than all the juggling Empirics, And ev'ry one another contradicts; All Laws of Heav'n and Earth can break, And swallow Oaths, and Blood, and Rapine easy; And yet is so infirm and weak, 'Twill not endure the gentlest Check, But at the slightest Nicety grows queasy; Disdains Controul, and yet can be No where, but in a Prison, free; Can force it self, in spight of God, Who makes it free as Thought at Home, A Slave and Villain to become, To serve its Interests abroad. And though no Pharisee was ere so cunning At tithing Mint and Cummin; No dull Idolater was ere so flat In Things of deep and solid Weight; Pretends to Charity and Holiness, But is implacable to Peace, And out of Tenderness grows obstinate. And though the Zeal of God's House eat a Prince And Prophet up (he says) long since, His cross-grain'd peremptory Zeal Would eat up God's House, and devour it at a Meal. VIII He does not pray, but prosecute, As if he went to Law, his Suit; Summons his Maker to appear, And answer what he shall prefer; Returns him back his Gift of Prayer, Not to petition, but declare; Exhibits cross Complaints Against him for the Breach of Covenants, And all the Charters of the Saints; Pleads guilty to the Action, and yet stands Upon high Terms, and bold Demands; Excepts against him and his Laws, And will be judge himself in his own Cause; And grows more saucy and severe Than th' Heathen Emp'ror was to Jupiter, That us'd to wrangle with him, and dispute; And sometimes wou'd speak softly in his Ear, And sometimes loud, and rant, and tear, And threaten, if he did not grant his Suit. IX But when his painful Gifts h' employs In holding-forth, the Virtue lies Not in the Letter of the Sense, But in the spiritual Vehemence, The Pow'r, and Dispensation of the Voice, The zealous Pangs and Agonies, And heav'nly turnings of the Eyes; The Groans, with which he piously destroys, And drowns the Nonsense in the Noise: And grows so loud, as if he meant to force And take in Heav'n by Violence; To fright the Saints into Salvation, Or Scare the Devil from Temptation; Until he falls so low and hoarse, No kind of carnal Sense, Can be made out of what he means: But as the antient Pagans were precise To use no short-tail'd Beast in Sacrifice, He still conforms to them, and has a Care, T' allow the largest Measure to his paltry Ware. X The ancient Churches, and the best By their own Martyrs Blood increas'd; But he has found out a new Way, To do it with the Blood of those, That dare his Church's Growth oppose, Or her imperious Canons disobey; And strives to carry on the Work, Like a true primitive reforming Turk, With holy Rage, and edifying War, More safe and pow'rful Ways by far: For the Turk's Patriarch Mahomet Was the first great Reformer, and the Chief Of th' ancient Christian Belief, That mix'd it with new Light, and Cheat, With Revelations, Dreams, and Visions, And apostolic Superstitions, To be held forth, and carry'd on by War; And his Successor was a Presbyter With greater Right, than Haly or Abubeker. XI For as a Turk, that is to act some Crime Against his Prophet's holy Law, Is wont to bid his Soul withdraw, And leave his Body for a Time: So, when some horrid Action's to be done, Our Turkish Proselite puts on Another Spirit, and lays by his own; And when his over-heated Brain Turns giddy, like his Brother Mussulman, He's judg'd inspir'd, and all his Frenzies held To be prophetic, and reveal'd. The one believes all Madmen to be Saints, Which th' other crys him down for, and abhors, And yet in Madness all Devotion plants, And where he differs most concurs; Both equally exact and just In Perjury, and Breach of Trust; So like in all Things, that one Brother Is but a Counterpart of th' other; And both unanimously damn, And hate (like two that Play one Game) Each other for it, while they strive to do the same. XII Both equally design to raise Their Churches by the self-same Ways; With War and Ruin to assert Their Doctrine, and with Sword and Fire convert; To preach the Gospel with a Drum, And for convincing overcome; And, though in worshipping of God all Blood Was by his own Laws disallow'd, Both hold no holy Rites to be so good: And both to propagate the Breed Of their own Saints one way proceed; For Lust and Rapes in War repair as fast, As Fury and Destruction waste; Both equally allow all Crimes As lawful Means to propagate a Sect; For Laws in War can be of no Effect, And Licence does more good in Gospel-times. Hence 'tis, that holy Wars have ever been The horrid'st Scenes of Blood and Sin; For when Religion does recede From her own Nature, nothing but a Breed Of Prodigies and hideous Monsters can succeed. UPON MODERN CRITICS I 'Tis well, that equal Heav'n has plac'd Those Joys above, that, to reward The Just and virtuous, are prepar'd, Beyond their reach, until their Pains are past; Else Men would rather venture to possess By force, than earn their Happiness; And only take the Dev'ls advice, As Adam did, how soonest to be wise, Though at th' expence of Paradise. For, as some say, to fight is but a base Mechanic Handy-work, and far below A gen'rous Spirit t' undergo: So 'tis to take the Pains to know, Which some, with only Confidence and Face, More easily and ably do; For daring Nonsense seldom fails to hit, Like scatter'd Shot, and pass with some for Wit. Who would not rather make himself a Judge, And boldly usurp the Chair, Than with dull Industry and Care Endure to study, think, and drudge For that, which he much sooner may advance With obstinate, and pertinacious Ignorance? II For all Men challenge, tho' in spite Of Nature and their Stars, a Right To censure, judge, and know; Tho' she can only order who Shall be, and who shall ne'er be wise: Then why should those, whom she denies Her favour and good graces to, Not strive to take Opinion by surprize, And ravish, what it were in vain to woo? For he, that desp'rately assumes The censure of all Wits and Arts, Tho' without Judgment, Skill, and Parts, Only to startle and amuse, And mask his Ignorance (as Indians use With gawdy colour'd Plumes Their homely nether Parts t' adorn) Can never fail to captive some, That will submit to his oraculous Doom, And rev'rence what they ought to scorn; Admire his sturdy confidence For solid Judgment, and deep Sense; And credit purchas'd without Pains or Wit, Like stolen Pleasures, ought to be most sweet. III Two Self-admirers, that combine Against the World, may pass a Fine Upon all Judgment, Sense, and Wit, And settle it, as they think fit, On one another, like the Choice Of Persian Princes by one Horse's Voice. For those fine Pageants, which some raise, Of false and disproportion'd Praise, T' enable whom they please t' appear, And pass for what they never were, In private only b'ing but nam'd, Their Modesty, must be asham'd, And not endure to hear; And yet may be divulg'd and fam'd, And own'd in public every where: So vain some Authors are to boast Their want of Ingenuity, and club Their affidavit Wits, to dub Each other but a Knight o' th' Post, As false as suborn'd Perjurers, That vouch away all right, they have to their own Ears. IV But when all other Courses fail, There is one easy Artifice, That seldom has been known to miss, To cry all Mankind down, and rail: For he, whom all Men do contemn, May be allow'd to rail again at them, And in his own Defence To outface Reason, Wit, and Sense, And all, that makes against himself, condemn; To snarle at all Things right or wrong, Like a mad Dog, that has a Worm in's Tongue; Reduce all Knowledge back of Good and Evil, T' its first Original the Devil; And, like a fierce Inquisitor of Wit, To spare no Flesh, that ever spoke, or writ; Tho' to perform his Task as dull, As if he had a Toad-stone in his Scull, And could produce a greater Stock Of Maggots than a pastoral Poet's Flock. V The feeblest Vermin can destroy, As sure as stoutest Beasts of Prey; And only with their Eyes and Breath Infect, and poyson Men to death: But that more impotent Buffoon, That makes it both his Bus'ness, and his Sport To rail at all, is but a Drone, That spends his Sting on what he cannot hurt, Enjoys a kind of Letchery in Spight, Like o'ergrown Sinners, that in whipping take Delight, Invades the Reputation of all those, That have, or have it not to lose; And if he chance to make a Difference, 'Tis always in the wrongest Sense: As rooking Gamesters never lay Upon those Hands, that use fair Play; But venture all their Bets Upon the Slurs, and cunning Tricks of ablest Cheats. VI Nor does he vex himself much less Than all the World beside, Falls sick of other Mens Excess, Is humbled only at their Pride, And wretched at their Happiness; Revenges on himself the Wrong, Which his vain Malice and loose Tongue To those, that feel it not, have done; And whips and spurs himself, because he is outgone; Makes idle Characters and Tales, As counterfeit, unlike, and false, As Witches Pictures are of Wax and Clay To those, whom they would in Effigie slay. And as the Devil, that has no Shape of's own, Affects to put the ugliest on, And leaves a Stink behind him, when he's gone; So he, that's worse than nothing, strives t' appear I' th' likeness of a Wolf or Bear, To fright the weak; but, when Men dare Encounter with him, stinks, and vanishes to air. TO THE HAPPY MEMORY Of the most Renown'd DU-VAL I 'Tis true, to compliment the Dead Is as impertinent and vain, As 'twas of old to call them back again, Or, like the Tartars, give them Wives With Settlements, for After-lives: For all that can be done, or said, Tho' ere so noble, great, and good, By them is neither heard, nor understood. All our fine Slights, and Tricks of Art, First to create, and then adore Desert, And those Romances, which we frame, To raise ourselves, not them, a Name, In vain are stuft with ranting Flatteries, And such as, if they knew, they would despise. For as those Times the Golden Age we call, In which there was no Gold in Use at all, So we plant Glory and Renown, Where it was ne'er deserv'd, nor known, But to worse Purpose many Times, To flourish o'er nefarious Crimes, And cheat the World, that never seems to mind, How good, or bad Men die, but what they leave behind. II And yet the brave Du-Val, whose Name Can never be worn out by Fame, That liv'd, and dy'd, to leave behind A great Example to Mankind; That fell a public Sacrifice, From Ruin to preserve those few, Who, tho' born false, may be made true, And teach the World to be more just, and wise, Ought not, like vulgar Ashes, rest Unmention'd in his silent Chest, Not for his own, but public Interest. He, like a pious Man, some Years before Th' Arrival of his fatal Hour, Made ev'ry Day he had to live, To his last Minute a Preparative; Taught the wild Arabs on the Road To act in a more gentle Mode, Take Prizes more obligingly than those Who never had been bred Filous; And how to hang in a more graceful fashion, Than e'er was known before to the dull English Nation. III In France the Staple of new Modes, Where Garbs and Miens are currant Goods, That serves the ruder Northern Nations With Methods of Address and Treat; Prescribes new Garnitures and Fashions, And how to drink, and how to eat No out-of-fashion Wine or Meat; To understand Cravats and Plumes, And the most modish from the old Perfumes; To know the Age and Pedigrees Of Poynts of Flandres or Venise; Cast their Nativities, and to a Day Foretel how long they'll hold, and when decay; T'affect the purest Negligences In Gestures, Gaits, and Miens, And speak by Repartee-rotines Out of the most authentic of Romances; And to demonstrate with substantial Reason, What Ribbands all the Year are in, or out of Season. IV In this great Academy of Mankind He had his Birth, and Education; Where all Men are s' ingeniously inclin'd, They understand by Imitation, Improve untaught, before they are aware, As if they suck'd their Breeding from the Air, That naturally does dispense To all a deep and solid Confidence, A Virtue of that precious Use, That he, whom bounteous Heav'n endues But with a mod'rate Share of it, Can want no Worth, Abilities, or Wit. In all the deep Hermetic Arts, (For so of late the Learned call All Tricks, if strange and mystical) He had improv'd his nat'ral Parts, And with his magic Rod could sound Where hidden Treasure might be found. He, like a Lord o' th' Manor, seiz'd upon What ever happen'd in his Way, As lawful Weft and Stray, And after by the Custom kept it as his own. V From these first Rudiments he grew To nobler Feats, and try'd his Force Upon whole Troops of Foot and Horse, Whom he as bravely did subdue; Declar'd all Caravans, that go Upon the King's Highway, the Foe; Made many desperate Attacks Upon itinerant Brigades Of all Professions, Ranks, and Trades, On Carriers Loads, and Pedlars Packs, Made 'em lay down their Arms, and yield And, to the smallest Piece, restore All, that by Cheating they had gain'd before; And after plunder'd all the Baggage of the Field. In every bold Affair of War He had the chief Command, and led them on; For no Man is judg'd fit to have the Care Of others Lives, until h' has made it known, How much he does despise, and scorn his own. VI Whole Provinces 'twixt Sun and Sun Have by his conqu'ring Sword been won; And mighty Sums of Money laid, For Ransom, upon every Man, And Hostages deliver'd till 'twas paid. Th' Excise and Chimney-Publican, The Jew-Forestaller and Enhancer, To him for all their Crimes did answer. He vanquish'd the most fierce and fell Of all his Foes, the Constable; And oft had beat his Quarters up, And routed him, and all his Troop. He took the dreadful Lawyer's Fees, That in his own allow'd Highway Does Feats of Arms as great as his, And, when th' encounter in it, wins the Day: Safe in his Garison the Court, Where meaner Criminals are sentenc'd for't, To this stern Foe he oft gave Quarter, But as the Scotchman did t' a Tartar, That he, in Time to come, Might in return from him receive his fatal Doom. VII He would have starv'd this mighty Town, And brought its haughty Spirit down, Have cut it off from all Relief, And, like a wise and valiant Chief Made many a Fierce Assault Upon all Ammunition Carts, And those that bring up Cheese, and Malt, Or Bacon, from remoter Parts; No Convoy e'er so strong with Food Durst venture on the desp'rate Road: He made th' undaunted Waggoner obey, And the fierce Higler Contribution pay, The savage Butcher and stout Drover Durst not to him their feeble Troops discover; And, if he had but kept the Field, In Time had made the City yield; For great Towns, like to Crocodiles, are found, I' th' Belly aptest to receive a mortal Wound. VIII But when the fatal Hour arriv'd, In which his Stars began to frown, And had in close Cabals contriv'd To pull him from his Height of Glory down; And he, by numerous Foes opprest, Was in th' enchanted Dungeon cast, Secur'd with mighty Guards, Lest he by Force or Stratagem Might prove too cunning for their Chains, and them, And break thro' all their Locks, and Bolts, and Wards, Had both his Legs by Charms committed To one another's Charge, That neither might be set at large, And all their Fury and Revenge outwitted. As Jewels of high Value are Kept under Locks with greater Care, Than those of meaner Rates; So he was in Stone Walls, and Chains, and Iron Grates. IX Thither came Ladies from all Parts, To offer up close Prisoners their Hearts, Which he receiv'd as Tribute due, And made them yield up Love and Honour too; But in more brave heroic ways, Than e'er were practis'd yet in Plays: For those two spightful Foes, who never meet But full of hot Contests, and Piques About Punctilios, and mere Tricks, Did all their Quarrels to his Doom submit; And far more generous and free, In Contemplation only of him did agree, Both fully satisfy'd; the one With those fresh Lawrels he had won, And all the brave renowned Feats, He had perform'd in Arms; The other with his Person, and his Charms: For just as Larks are catch'd in Nets, By gazing on a Piece of Glass; So while the Ladies view'd his brighter Eyes, And smoother polish'd Face, Their gentle Hearts, alas! were taken by Surprize. X Never did bold Knight, to relieve Distressed Dames, such dreadful Feats atchieve, As feeble Damsels, for his Sake, Would have been proud to undertake; And bravely ambitious to redeem The World's Loss, and their own, Strove who should have the Honour to lay down, And change a Life with him: But finding all their Hopes in vain To move his fix'd determin'd Fate, Their Life itself began to hate, As if it were an Infamy To live, when he was doom'd to die; Made loud Appeals and Moans, To less hard-hearted Grates and Stones; Came swell'd with Sighs, and drown'd in Tears, To yield themselves his Fellow-sufferers; And follow'd him, like Prisoners of War Chain'd to the lofty Wheels of his triumphant Car.</field>

A BALLAD [Draw neare, good People, al draw neare] PART I Draw neare, good People, al draw neare, And hearken to my Ditty; A stranger Thing Then this I sing Came never to this City. Had you but seen this monster, You would not give a Farthing For the Lyons in th' Grate, Nor the Mountaine Cat, Nor the Bears in Paris-Garden. You would defy the Pageants Are born before the Mayor; The strangest shape, You ere did Gape Upon in Bartlemew-fayr! His Face is round and decent, As is your Dish or Platter, On which there grow's A thing like a Nose, But, indeed, it is no such matter. On both sides of th' aforesayd Are eies, but th' are not matches, Ore which there are To be seen two fayr And large, wel-grown Mustaches. Now this with admiration Dos al beholders strike, That a Beard should grow Upon a Things Brow, Did ye ever see the like? He has no Scul, 'tis well known To thousands of beholders; Nothing, but a Skin, Dos keep his braines in From Running about his shoulders. On both sides of his Noddle Are straps o' th' very same lether; Ears are imply'd But th' are mere hide Or morsels of Tripe, chuse ye whether. Between these two extendeth A slit from eare to eare That, evry howr, Do's gape to devour The Sowce that grows so neare. Beneath, a Tuft of Bristles As rough as a Frees-Jerkin; If it had been a Beard, 'Twould have serv'd a heard Of Goats, that are of his neare kin. Within, a Set of Grinders Most sharp and keen, Corroding Your Ir'n and bras As easy as, That you would do a Pudding. But the strangest thing of al is, Upon his Rump there groweth A great long Tayl, That useth to Trayle Upon the Ground, as he goeth. PART II This monster was begotten Upon one of the witches, B' an Imp that came to her, Like a Man, to woo her, With black Dublet and breeches. When he was whelpd, for certaine, In divers sevral Cuntrys, The Hogs and swine Did grunt and whine, And the Ravens Croakd upon Trees. The windes did blow, the Thunder And lightning lowdly rumbled; The Dogs did howl, The hollow Tree in th' Owl— 'Tis a good hors that nere stumbled. As soon as he was brought forth, At th' midwife's Throat he flew, And threw the Pap Down in her Lap; They say 'tis very true. And up the wals he clamberd, With Nayles most sharp and keen, The Prints whereof, I' th' Bords and the Roofe, Are yet for to be seen. And out at the Top o' th' Chimny He vanishd, seen of none; For they did winke, Yet by the Stinke Knew which way he was gone. The Country round about there Became like to a wilder- ness; for the sight Of him did fright Away men, women, and children. Long did he there Continue, And al those Parts much harmed, Til a wise-woman, which Some cal a white witch, Him into a Hogsty charmed. There when she had him shut fast, With brimstone and with Niter She singd the Claws Of his left Paws, With the tip of his Tayl, and his right eare. And with her Charmes and Oyntments She made him Tame as a Spaniel; For she usd to ride On his back astride, Nor did he do her any il. But, to the admiration Of al both far and neare, He hath been shown In evry Town, A[nd] eke in evry Shere.

      <field name="fulltext">MOCK ENCOMIUMS To the Honourable EDWARD HOWARD, Esq; Upon his incomparable POEM of the BRITISH PRINCES SIR, You've obliged the British Nation more Than all their Bards could ever do before, And at your own Charge, Monuments more hard Than Brass, or Marble, to their Fame have rear'd: For as all warlike Nations take delight To hear how brave their Ancestors could fight, You have advanc'd to wonder their Renown, And no less virtuously improv'd your own. For 'twill be doubted, whether you do write, Or they have acted at a nobler hight. You of their ancient Princes have retriev'd More than the Ages knew, in which they liv'd; Describ'd their Customs, and their Rites anew, Better than all their Druids ever knew: Unriddled their dark Oracles, as well, As those themselves, that made them, could foretell. For as the Britons long have hop'd in vain, Arthur would come to govern them again; You have fulfill'd that Prophecy alone, And in this Poem plac'd him on his Throne. Such magic Pow'r has your prodigious Pen, To raise the Dead, and give new Life to Men. Make rival Princes meet in Arms, and Love, Whom distant Ages did so far remove: For as Eternity has neither past, Nor future, (Authors say) nor first, nor last, But is all instant; your eternal Muse All Ages can to any one reduce. Then why should you, whose Miracle of Art Can Life at Pleasure to the Dead impart, Trouble in vain your better busied Head T' observe what Time they liv'd in, or were dead? For since you have such arbitrary Power, It were defect in Judgment to go lower, Or stoop to Things so pitifully lewd, As use to take the vulgar Latitude. There's no Man fit to read what you have writ, That holds not some Proportion with your Wit: As Light can no Way but by Light appear, He must bring Sense, that understands it here. A PALINODIE To the Honourable EDWARD HOWARD, Esq; Upon his incomparable BRITISH PRINCES It is your Pardon, Sir, for which my Muse Thrice humbly thus, in form of Paper, sues; For having felt the dead Weight of your Wit, She comes to ask Forgiveness, and submit, Is sorry for her Faults, and, while I write, Mourns in the Black, does Penance in the White: But such is her Belief in your just Candor, She hopes you will not so misunderstand her, To wrest her harmless Meaning to the Sense Of silly Emulation, or Offence. No; your sufficient Wit does still declare Itself too amply, they are mad that dare So vain and senseless a Presumption own, To yoak your vast Parts in comparison. And yet, you might have thought upon a Way T' instruct us, how you'd have us to obey, And not command our Praises, and then blame All that's too great, or little for your Fame. For who could choose but err, without some Trick To take your Elevation to a Nick? As he, that was desir'd, upon occasion, To make the Mayor of London an Oration, Desir'd his Lordship's Favour, that he might Take Measure of his Mouth, to fit it right; So, had you sent a Scantling of your Wit, You might have blam'd us, if it did not fit; But 'tis not just t' impose, and then cry down All that's unequal to your huge Renown; For he, that writes below your vast Desert, Betrays his own, and not your Want of Art. Praise, like a Robe of State, should not fit close To th' Person 'tis made for, but wide and loose, Derives its Comeliness from being unfit, And such have been our Praises of your Wit, Which is so extraordinary, no Height Of Fancy but your own can do it right; Witness those glorious Poems you have writ With equal Judgment, Learning, Art, and Wit, And those stupendious Discoveries, You've lately made of Wonders in the Skies. For who but from yourself did ever hear, The Sphere of Atoms was the Atmosphere? Who ever shut those Straglers in a Room, Or put a Circle about Vacuum, What should confine those undetermin'd Crowds, And yet extend no further than the Clouds? Who ever could have thought, but you alone, A Sign, and an Ascendant were all one? Or how 'tis possible the Moon should shrowd Her Face, to peep at Mars, behind a Cloud; Since Clouds below are so far distant plac'd, They cannot hinder her from being barefac'd? Who ever did a Language so enrich, To scorn all little Particles of Speech? For though they make the Sense clear, yet th' are found To be a scurvy Hindrance to the Sound; Therefore you wisely scorn your Stile to humble, Or for the Sense's Sake to wave the Rumble, Had Homer known this Art, h' had ne'er been fain To use so many Particles in vain, That to no Purpose serve, but (as he hap's To want a Syllable) to fill up Gaps. You justly coin new Verbs to pay for those, Which in Construction you o'ersee, and lose: And by this Art do Priscian no Wrong When you break 's Head, for 'tis as broad as long. These are your own Discoveries, which none But such a Muse as yours could hit upon, That can in spight of Laws of Art, or Rules Make Things more intricate than all the Schools For what have Laws of Art to do with you, More than the Laws with honest Men and true? He that's a Prince in Poetry should strive To cry 'em down, by his Prerogative, And not submit to that, which has no Force But o'er Delinquents, and Inferiors. Your Poems will indure to be try'd I' th' Fire like Gold, and come forth purify'd, Can only to Eternity pretend, For they were never writ to any End. All other Books bear an uncertain Rate, But those you write are always sold by Weight, Each Word and Syllable brought to the Scale, And valu'd to a Scruple in the Sale. For, when the Paper's charg'd with your rich Wit, 'Tis for all Purposes and Uses fit, Has an abstersive Virtue to make clean Whatever Nature made in Man obscene. Boys find b' Experiment, no Paper-kite, Without your Verse, can make a noble Flight. It keeps our Spice, and Aromatics sweet; In Paris they perfume their Rooms with it; For burning but one Leaf of yours, they say, Drives all their Stinks and Nastiness away. Cooks keep their Pyes from burning with your Wit, Their Pigs and Geese from scorching on the Spit: And Vintners find their Wines are ne'er the worse, When Ars'nick's only wrap'd up in the Verse. These are the great Performances, that raise Your mighty Parts above all reach of Praise, And give us only Leave t' admire your Worth, For no Man, but yourself, can set it forth, Whose wond'rous Pow'r's so generally known, Fame is the Echo, and her Voice your own. A PANEGYRIC UPON Sir JOHN DENHAM'S Recovery from his Madness Sir, you've outliv'd so desperate a Fit, As none could do, but an immortal Wit; Had yours been less, all Helps had been in vain, And thrown away, tho' on a less sick Brain: But you were so far from receiving Hurt, You grew improv'd, and much the better for't. As when th' Arabian Bird does sacrifice, And burn himself in his own Country's Spice; A Maggot first breeds in her pregnant Urn, Which after does to a young Phœnix turn: So your hot Brain, burnt in its native Fire, Did Life renew'd, and vig'rous Youth acquire; And with so much Advantage, some have guest, Your After-wit is like to be your best; And now expect far greater Matters of ye, Than the bought Cooper's Hill, or borrow'd Sophy: Such as your Tully lately drest in Verse, Like those he made himself, or not much worse; And Seneca's dry Sand unmixt with Lime, Such as you cheat the King with, botch'd in Rhime. Nor were your Morals less improv'd; all Pride, And native Insolence quite laid aside; And that ungovern'd Outrage, that was wont All, that you durst with Safety, to affront. No China Cupboard rudely overthrown; Nor Lady tip'd, by being accosted, down; No Poet jeer'd, for scribbling amiss, With Verses forty times more lewd than his: Nor did your Crutch give Battle to your Duns, And hold it out, where you had built, a Sconce; Nor furiously laid Orange-Wench aboard, For asking what in Fruit and Love you'd scor'd; But all Civility and Complacence, More than you ever us'd, before or since. Beside, you never over-reach'd the King One Farthing, all the while, in reckoning, Nor brought in false Accompt, with little Tricks Of passing broken Rubbish for whole Bricks; False mustering of Workmen by the Day, Deduction out of Wages, and dead Pay For those that never liv'd; all which did come, By thrifty Management, to no small Sum. You pull'd no Lodgings down, to build them worse; Nor repair'd others, to repair your Purse, As you were wont; till all you built appear'd Like that, Amphion with his Fiddle rear'd: For had the Stones (like his) charm'd by your Verse Built up themselves, they could not have done worse: And, sure, when first you ventur'd to survey, You did design to do't no other way. All this was done before those Days began, In which you were a wise and happy Man. For who e'er liv'd in such a Paradise, Until fresh Straw and Darkness op'd your Eyes? Who ever greater Treasure could command, Had nobler Palaces, and richer Land, Than you had then, who could raise Sums as vast, As all the Cheats of a Dutch War could waste, Or all those practis'd upon public Money? For nothing, but your Cure, could have undone ye. For ever are you bound to curse those Quacks, That undertook to cure your happy Cracks; For, tho' no Art can ever make them sound, The tamp'ring cost you Threescore Thousand Pound. How high might you have liv'd, and play'd, and lost, Yet been no more undone by being chowst, Nor forc'd upon the King's Accompt to lay All, that in serving him, you lost at Play? For nothing, but your Brain, was ever found To suffer Sequestration, and Compound. Yet you've an Imposition laid on Brick, For all you then laid out, at Beast, or Gleek: And, when you've rais'd a Sum, strait let it fly, By understanding low, and vent'ring high; Until you have reduc'd it down to Tick, And then recruit again from Lime and Brick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATIONS BOILEAU SATYR on RHYME Great famous Wit, whose rich and easy Vein, Free, and unus'd to Drudgery and Pain, Has all Apollo's Treasure at command, And, how good Verse is coin'd, dost understand; In all Wit's Combats Master of Defence, Tell me, how dost thou pass on Rhime and Sense? 'Tis said th' apply to thee, and in thy Verse Do freely range themselves as Volunteers; And without Pain, or pumping for a Word, Place themselves fitly of their own Accord. I, whom a lewd Caprich (for some great Crime I have committed) has condemn'd to rhime, With slavish Obstinacy vex my Brain To reconcile 'em, but, alas! in vain. Sometimes I set my Wits upon the Rack, And, when I would say white, the Verse says black. When I would draw a brave Man to the Life, It names some Slave, that pimps to his own Wife; Or base Poltroon, that would have sold his Daughter, If he had met with any to have bought her. When I would praise an Author, the untoward Damn'd Sense, says Virgil, but the Rhime— In fine, whate'er I strive to bring about, The contrary (spight of my Heart) comes out. Sometimes, enrag'd for Time and Pains misspent, I give it over tir'd, and discontent; And, damning the dull Fiend a thousand Times, By whom I was possest, forswear all Rhimes; But having curst the Muses, they appear, To be reveng'd for't, e're I am aware. Spight of myself, I strait take fire agen, Fall to my Task with Paper, Ink, and Pen, And breaking all the Oaths I made, in vain From Verse to Verse, expect their Aid again. But if my Muse, or I were so discreet, T' endure, for Rhime's Sake, one dull Epithet, I might, like others, easily command Words without Study, ready and at Hand, In praising Chloris, Moons, and Stars, and Skies Are quickly made to match her Face, and Eyes;— And Gold, and Rubies, with as little Care, To fit the Colour of her Lips, and Hair; And mixing Suns, and Flow'rs, and Pearl, and Stones, Make 'em serve all Complexions at once, With these fine Fancies, at hap-hazard writ, I could make Verses without Art or Wit, And, shifting forty times the Verb and Noun, With stol'n Impertinence patch up mine own. But, in the Choice of Words, my scrup'lous Wit Is fearful to pass one, that is unfit; Nor can endure to fill up a void Place, At a Line's End, with one insipid Phrase; And, therefore, when I scribble twenty Times, When I have written four, I blot two Rhimes. May he be damn'd, who first found out that Curse, T' imprison, and confine his Thoughts in Verse; To hang so dull a Clog upon his Wit, And make his Reason to his Rhime submit. Without this Plague, I freely might have spent My happy Days with Leisure and Content; Had nothing in the World to do, or think, Like a fat Priest, but whore, and eat, and drink; Had past my Time as pleasantly away, Slept all the Night, and loiter'd all the Day. My Soul, that's free from Care, and Fear, and Hope, Knows how to make her own Ambition stoop, T' avoid uneasy Greatness, and Resort, Or for Preferment following the Court. How happy had I been, if, for a Curse, The Fates had never sentenc'd me to Verse? But, ever since this peremptory Vein With restless Frenzy first posses'd my Brain, And that the Devil tempted me, in spite Of my own Happiness, to judge, and write, Shut up against my Will, I waste my Age In mending this, and blotting out that Page; And grow so weary of the slavish Trade, I envy their Condition, that write bad. O happy Scudery! whose easy Quill Can, once a Month, a mighty Volume fill. For, though thy works are written in despite Of all good Sense, impertinent, and slight, They never have been known to stand in need Of Stationer to sell, or Sot to read. For, so the Rhime be at the Verse's End, No matter whither all the rest do's tend. Unhappy is that Man, who, spite of 's Heart, Is forc'd to be ty'd up to Rules of Art. A Fop that scribbles, does it with Delight, Takes no Pains to consider, what to write; But, fond of all the Nonsense he brings forth, Is ravish'd with his own great Wit and Worth. While brave and noble Writers vainly strive To such a Height of Glory to arrive: But still, with all they do unsatisfy'd, Ne'er please themselves, though all the World beside. And those, whom all Mankind admire for Wit, Wish for their own Sakes, they had never writ, Thou then, that see'st how ill I spend my Time, Teach me for Pity, how to make a Rhime; And, if th' Instructions chance to prove in vain, Teach—how ne'er to write again. OVID CYDIPPE HER ANSWER TO ACONTIUS In silent fear I read your Letter o're; Lest I shou'd Swear, as I had done before! Nor had I read, but I fear'd t' engage By my neglect the peevish Goddess Rage: In vain I deck her Shrine, her Rites attend, The partial Goddess still remains your Friend. A Virgin rather shou'd a Virgin Aid, But where I seek Relief I am betray'd! I languish, and the Cause of my Disease As yet lies hid, no Medicine gives me Ease. In how much pain do I this Letter write! To my weak Hand my sicklier thoughts indite: What anxious fear alas afflicts me too, Lest any but my trusty Nurse shou'd know! To gain me time to write, the door she keeps, And whispering tells the Visitants—She Sleeps. Worse ills I could not for your sake sustain, Tho' you had merit equal to my Pain. Your Love betrays, my Beauty proves my Snare, I had been happy had I seem'd less Fair: Whilst with your Rival you contend to raise My Beauty's Fame, I perish by your Praise: Whilst neither will admit the others Claim, The Chase is hinder'd, and both miss the Game. My Nuptial day draws on, my Parents press The Sacred Rites, my blooming years no less. But whilst glad Hymen at my door attends, Grim Death waits near to force me from his Hands. Some call my Sickness Chance, and some pretend The Gods this Lett to cross my Nuptials send; Whilst by severer Censure you are guest, By Philtra's to have wrought upon my Breast. If then your love such mischief can create, What Misery is reserv'd for her you Hate! Wou'd I to Delos ne'r had found the way, At least not found it on that fatal Day! When in our Port our Anchors first we weigh'd, Th' unwilling vessel still i' th' Harbour stay'd; Twice did cross winds beat back our flagging Sails; Said I, cross winds? no! those were prosp'rous Gales! Those winds alone blew fair, that back convey'd Our Ship, and those that oft our Passage stay'd. Yet I to see fam'd Delos am in pain, And fondly of each hind'ring blast complain. By Tenos Isle, and Mycone we Steer'd, At last fair Delos' winding Cliffs appear'd; And much I fear lest now the Fairy Shore, Shou'd vanish, as 'tis said t' have done before. At night we Land, soon as the day return'd My platted Tresses are with Gemms adorn'd, Then to attend the Sacred Rites we go, And pious Incense on each Altar throw, My Parents there at their Devotion stay; My Nurse and I through all the Temple stray: We view each Court, and each, fresh wonder brings; Pictures, and Statues, Gifts of Ancient Kings. But whilst into these Rarities I pry'd, I am my self by sly Acontius spy'd. Thence to the inmost Temple we remove, The place that should a Sanctuary prove. Yet there I find the Apple with this Rhime— Ah! me, I'd like to have Sworn the second time! The Name of Wedlock I no sooner read, But through my Cheeks a troubled blush was spread. Why didst thou cheat an unsuspecting Maid? I shou'd have been intreated, not betray'd: Is then the Goddess bound to take thy part? And ratifie an Oath without the heart? The will consents, but that was absent there; I read indeed the Oath, but did not swear. Yet cannot I deny that I suspect Diana's Rage this sickness do's inflict; Glad Hymen thrice did to our Courts repair, Thrice frighted fled to find Death planted there. Thin Cov'rings on my Feaverish Limbs are spread, My Parents mourn me as already Dead. What have I done to merit this distress, That read but words whose fraud I cou'd not guess! Do thou, ev'n thou from whom my suff'rings spring, T' appease the Goddess Rage thine Off'rings bring. When will those hands that writ the fatal Rhime Bear Incense to remove my pain, thy Crime! Nor think that thy rich Rival, tho' allow'd To Visit, is of greater Favours proud. By me he sits, but still just distance keeps, Restless as I, talks seldom, often weeps: Blushing he takes a kiss, and leaves a tear, And once his Courage serv'd to Cry—My Dear. But from his arms still by degrees I creep, And to prevent discourse pretend to sleep. He finds, but wou'd his Sense o' th' flight disguise, He checks his Tongue, but chides me with his Eyes. With grief he wasts, and I with Feavours pine 'Tis we that suffer, but th' Offence was thine. You write for leave to come and see me here, Yet know your former visit cost me dear. Why wouldst thou hither come, thou canst but see The double Trophies of thy Cruelty. My flesh consum'd, my Cheeks of bloodless hue, Such as I once did in thy Apple view. Shou'dst see me now thou wou'dst repent thy cheat, Nor think me worth such exquisite Deceit. To Delos back with greater haste wou'dst go, And beg the Goddess to release my Vow. On new designs thy fancy wou'dst imploy, Contrive new Oaths the former to destroy. No Means have been omitted to procure My health, but still my Feav'rish fits endure. We ask'd the Oracle what caus'd my pains? The Oracle of broken Vows complains! The Gods themselves on your behalf declare: What hast thou done to merit this their care? But so it is—and I at last incline, Since that thou art their choice, to make thee Mine. Already to my Mother I've declar'd, How by your Cunning I have been insnar'd. I've done, and what I have already said, I fear is more than will become a Maid. My thoughts are now confus'd, and can indite No more, my feeble hand no more can write. Nor need I more subscribe, but this, Be True! And (since it must be so) my Dear, Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS PIECES REPARTEES between CAT and PUSS at a CATERWALLING In the Modern Heroic Way It was about the middle Age of Night, When half the Earth stood in the other's Light; And Sleep, Death's Brother, yet a Friend to Life, Gave weary'd Nature a Restorative: When Puss, wrapt warm in his own native Furs, Dreamt soundly of as soft and warm Amours, Of making Galantry in Gutter-tiles, And sporting on delightful Fagot-piles; Of bolting out of Bushes in the dark, As Ladies use at Midnight in the Park; Or seeking in tall Garrets an Alcove, For Assignations in th' Affairs of Love. At once his Passion was both false and true, And the more false, the more in earnest grew. He fancy'd, that he heard those amorous Charms, That us'd to summon him to soft Alarms, To which he always brought an equal Flame, To fight a Rival, or to court a Dame: And, as in Dreams Love's Raptures are more taking, Than all their actual Enjoyments waking, His amorous Passion grew to that Extream, His Dream itself awak'd him from his Dream. Thought he, what Place is this! or whither art Thou vanish'd from me, Mistress of my Heart? But now, I had her in this very Place, Here, fast imprison'd in my glad Embrace, And, while my Joys beyond themselves were rapt, I know not how, nor whither thou'rt escap'd: Stay, and I'll follow thee—With that he leap'd Up from the lazy Couch on which he slept; And, wing'd with Passion, through his known Purlieu, Swift as an Arrow from a Bow, he flew, Nor stop'd, until his Fire had him convey'd, Where many an Assignation h' had enjoy'd; Where finding, what he sought, a mutual Flame, That long had stay'd and call'd, before he came, Impatient of Delay, without one Word, To lose no further Time, he fell aboard; But grip'd so hard, he wounded what he lov'd; While she, in Anger, thus his Heat reprov'd. C. Forbear, foul Ravisher, this rude Address, Canst thou at once both injure and caress? P. Thou hast bewitch'd me with thy pow'rful Charms, And I, by drawing Blood, would cure my Harms. C. He, that does love, would set his Heart a Tilt, Ere one Drop of his Lady's should be spilt. P. Your Wounds are but without, and mine within; You wound my Heart, and I but prick your Skin: And while your Eyes pierce deeper than my Claws, You blame th' Effect, of which you are the Cause. C. How could my guiltless Eyes your Heart invade, Had it not first been by your own betray'd? Hence 'tis, my greatest Crime has only been (Not in mine Eyes, but yours) in being seen. P. I hurt to love, but do not love to hurt. C. That's worse than making Cruelty a Sport. P. Pain is the Foil of Pleasure, and Delight, That sets it off to a more noble Height. C. He buys his Pleasure at a Rate too vain, That takes it up beforehand of his Pain. P. Pain is more dear than Pleasure, when 'tis past. C. But grows intolerable, if it last. P. Love is too full of Honour, to regard What it enjoys, but suffers, as reward. What Knight durst ever own a Lover's Name, That had not been half murther'd by his Flame? Or Lady, that had never lain at Stake, To Death, or force of Rivals for his Sake? C. When Love do's meet with Injury and Pain, Disdain's the only Med'cine for Disdain. P. At once I'm happy, and unhappy too, In being pleas'd, and in displeasing you. C. Prepost'rous Way of Pleasure, and of Love, That contrary to its own End would move! 'Tis rather Hate, that covets to destroy; Love's Business is to love, and to enjoy. P. Enjoying and destroying are all one, As Flames destroy that which they feed upon. C. He never lov'd at any gen'rous Rate, That in th' Enjoyment found his Flame abate. As Wine (the Friend of Love) is wont to make The Thirst more violent, it pretends to slake; So should Fruition do the Lovers fire, Instead of lessening, inflame Desire. P. What greater Proof, that Passion do's transport, When, what I would dye for, I'm forc'd to hurt? C. Death among Lovers is a Thing despis'd, And far below a sullen Humour priz'd. That is more scorn'd, and rail'd at than the Gods, When they are crost in Love, or fall at odds. But since you understand not what you do, I am the Judge of what I feel, not you. P. Passion begins indifferent to prove, When Love considers any Thing but Love. C. The Darts of Love (like Lightning) wound within, And, though they pierce it, never hurt the Skin; They leave no Marks behind them, where they fly, Though through the tend'rest Part of all, the Eye; But your sharp Claws have left enough to shew, How tender I have been, how cruel you. P. Pleasure is Pain, for when it is enjoy'd, All it could wish for was but to b' allay'd. C. Force is a rugged Way of making Love. P. What you like best, you always disapprove. C. He that will wrong his Love will not be nice, T' excuse the Wrong he does, to wrong her twice. P. Nothing is wrong, but that which is ill meant. C. Wounds are ill cured with a good intent. P. When you mistake that for an Injury, I never meant, you do the Wrong, not I. C. You do not feel yourself the Pain you give; But 'tis not that alone, for which I grieve; But 'tis your want of Passion that I blame, That can be cruel, where you own a Flame. P. 'Tis you are guilty of that Cruelty, Which you at once outdo, and blame in me: For while you stifle, and inflame Desire, You burn, and starve me in the self-same Fire. C. It is not I, but you, that do the Hurt, Who wound yourself, and then accuse me for't: As Thieves, that rob themselves 'twixt Sun and Sun, Make others pay for what themselves have done. UPON PHILIP NYE'S THANKSGIVING BEARD A beard is but the Vizard of a Face, That Nature orders for no other Place; The Fringe and Tassel of a Countenance, That hides his Person from another Man's; And, like the Roman Habits of their Youth, Is never worn until his perfect Growth; A Privilege, no other Creature has, To wear a nat'ral Mask upon his Face, That shifts its Likeness, every Day he wears, To fit some other Persons Characters; And by its own Mythology implies, That Men were born to live in some Disguise. This satisfy'd a reverend Man, that clear'd His disagreeing Conscience by his Beard. H' had been prefer'd i' th' Army, when the Church Was taken with a Why not? in the lurch; When Primate, Metropolitan, and Prelates Were turn'd to Officers of Horse, and Zealots, From whom he held the most Pluralities Of Contributions, Donatives, and Salaries; Was held the chiefest of those spiritual Trumpets, That sounded Charges to their fiercest Combats, But in the desperatest of Defeats Had never blown as opportune Retreats; Until the Synod order'd his Departure To London, from his caterwalling Quarter, To sit among 'em, as he had been chosen, And pass, or null things, at his own disposing; Could clap up Souls in Limbo with a Vote, And for their Fees discharge, and let them out; Which made some Grandees bribe him with the Place Of holding-forth upon Thanksgiving-Days, Whither the Members, two and two abrest, March'd to take in the Spoils of all—the Feast; But by the way repeated the Oh-hones Of his wild Irish and chromatic Tones, His frequent and pathetic hums and haws, He practis'd only t' animate the Cause, With which the Sisters were so prepossest, They cou'd remember nothing of the rest. He thought upon it, and resolv'd to put His Beard into as wonderful a Cut, And, for the further Service of the Women, T' abate the Rigidness of his Opinion; And, but a Day before, had been to find The ablest Virtuoso of the Kind, With whom he long and seriously confer'd On all Intrigues, that might concern his Beard; By whose Advice he sat for a Design In little drawn, exactly to a Line: That, if the Creature chance to have Occasion To undergo a Thorough-reformation, It might be born conveniently about, And by the meanest Artist copy'd out. This done, he sent a Journeyman Sectary, H' had brought up to retrieve, and fetch, and carry, To find out one, that had the greatest Practice, To prune, and bleach the Beards of all Fanatics, And set their most confus'd Disorders right, Not by a new Design, but newer Light; Who us'd to shave the Grandees of their Sticklers, And crop the Worthies of their Conventiclers; To whom he shew'd his new-invented Draught, And told him, how 'twas to be copy'd out. Quoth he, 'tis but a false, and counterfeit, And scandalous Device of human Wit, That's absolutely forbidden in the Scripture, To make of any carnal thing the Picture. Quoth th' other Saint, you must leave that to us, T' agree what's lawful, or what scandalous: For, till it is determin'd by our Vote, It's either lawful, scandalous, or not; Which, since we have not yet agreed upon, Is left indiff'rent to avoid or own. Quoth he, my Conscience never shall agree To do it, till I know what 'tis to be; For, though I use it in a lawful Time, What, if it after should be made a Crime. 'Tis true, we fought for Liberty of Conscience 'Gainst human Constitutions in our own Sense; Which I'm resolv'd perpetually t' avow, And make it lawful, whatsoe'er we do; Then do your Office with your greatest Skill, And let th' Event befall us, how it will. This said, the nice Barbarian took his Tools, To prune the Zealot's Tenets, and his Jowles; Talk'd on as pertinently, as he snipt, A hundred times for every Hair he clipt; Until the Beard at length began t' appear, And reassume its antique Character, Grew more and more itself, that Art might strive, And stand in Competition with the Life: For some have doubted, if 'twere made of Snips Of Sables glew'd and fitted to his Lips; And set in such an artificial Frame, As if it had been wrought in Filograin, More subtly fil'd and polisht than the Gin, That Vulcan caught himself a Cuckold in; That Lachesis, that spins the Threads of Fate, Could not have drawn it out more delicate. But b'ing design'd and drawn so regular, T' a scrup'lous Punctilio of a Hair, Who cou'd imagine, that it shou'd be portal To selfish, inward-unconforming Mortal? And yet it was, and did abominate The least Compliance in the Church or State; And from it self did equally dissent, As from Religion, and the Government. PROLOGUE TO THE QUEEN OF ARRAGON, Acted before the Duke of York, Upon his Birth-Day Sir, while so many Nations strive to pay The Tribute of their Glories to this Day, That gave them Earnest of so great a Sum Of Glory (from your future Acts) to come; And which you have discharg'd at such a rate, That all succeeding Times must celebrate: We, that subsist by your bright Influence, And have no Life, but what we own from thence, Come humbly to present you, our own way, With all we have (beside our Hearts) a Play. But as devoutest Men can pay no more To Deities, than what they gave before; We bring you only, what your great Commands Did rescue for us from ingrossing Hands, That would have taken out Administration Of all departed Poets Goods i' th' Nation; Or, like to Lords of Manors, seiz'd all Plays, That come within their Reach, as Wefts and Strays; And claim'd a Forfeiture of all past Wit, But that your Justice put a stop to it. 'Twas well for us, who else must have been glad T' admit of all, who now write new, and bad: For still the wickeder some Authors write, Others to write worse are encourag'd by't. And though those fierce Inquisitors of Wit, The Critics, spare no Flesh, that ever writ; But just as Tooth-draw'rs find among the Rout Their own Teeth work in pulling others out; So they, decrying all of all that write, Think to erect a Trade of judging by't. Small Poetry, like other Heresies, By being persecuted multiplies: But here th' are like to fail of all Pretence; For he, that writ this Play, is dead long since, And not within their Pow'r: for Bears are said To spare those, that lie still, and seem but dead. EPILOGUE Upon the same. To the DUTCHESS. Madam, the Joys of this great Day are due, No less than to your royal Lord, to you; And, while three mighty Kingdoms pay your Part, You have, what's greater than them all, his Heart, That Heart, that, when it was his Country's Guard, The Fury of two Elements out-dar'd; And made a stubborn haughty Enemy The Terror of his dreadful Conduct fly; And yet you conquer'd it—and made your Charms Appear no less victorious, than his Arms: For which you oft' have triumph'd on this Day, And many more to come Heav'n grant you may. But, as great Princes use, in solemn Times Of Joy, to pardon all, but heinous Crimes; If we have sin'd, without an ill Intent, And done below what really we meant, We humbly ask your Pardon for't, and pray You would forgive, in Honour of the Day. AN EPISTLE to a FRIEND A FRAGMENT This Night we are met at the Globe of Purpose To Drink, and to write to thy Gentle Corpus; Where, having got Sack, Pen, Paper, and Inke, I wish I could write as easy as thinke; But th' best way of all to put us in, I think, is with Drinking first to begin. Here's a Health to thy self, and thy second Part, The wine's not so neare, as y' are both to my Heart, And that's not very far of[f], Pardy! For I feel it warme my Pericardy. This Night w' intend to sup, and lodge at Kingston, Where wee shal want a Poet, unles thou bring'st one. TO THOMAS ? Thomas, thou art so great a Drunkard, Th' art able to o'relay a Dung-cart. Thomas thou art all Ale, thy Skin Hath nothing else but ale therein. That Scull of thine, instead of Braines, Is Stuft with half a Peck of Graines, [Thy] Heart, thy liver, and thy Lungs, Is made of that, that stoppeth Bungs; Thou dost not drink at any club But tun Ale int' another Tub Which Learned Brewers call a Fat, And none can say but thou art that; Thence it Run's out at a Small Tap, That ha's indured man' a Clap; But now 'tis safe enough, No whore Can ever hurt it any more, Unless she could shoot Pox at distance A Furlung of[f], for such Resistance Thy Belly makes—Belly said I? No, Thomas, I confess I ly. It was a Belly once, but now It is a Tun, and like to grow As mighty, if our hopes it answer, As that at Heidleburg, thy Grandsire. TRIPLETS UPON AVARICE As Miners their own Laws Injoyn To weare no Pockets in the Mine For feare they should the Oare Purloyn; So he that Toyles, and Labours hard To Gaine, and what he Gets has Spard, Is from the use of all Debard. And tho he can Produce more Spankers Than all the usurers, and Bankers, Yet after more and More he Hankers. And after all his Paines are don Has nothing he can call his own But a meare Livelyhood alone. EPIGRAM ON A CLUB of SOTS The jolly Members of a toping Club, Like Pipestaves, are but hoop'd into a Tub; And in a close Confederacy link, For nothing else, but only to hold Drink. DESCRIPTION OF HOLLAND A cuntry that Draw[s] fifty foot of Water, In which Men live, as in the Hold of Nature; And when the Sea dos in upon them break And Drown a Province, dos but Spring a Leak; That always Ply the Pump, and never think They can be Safe, but at the Rate they stink; That Live as if they had been Run on Ground, And when they dy, are cast away, and Drownd; That dwel in Ships, like Swarms of Rats, and Prey Upon the Goods all Nations Fleets Convey, And, when their Merchants are Blown up and Crackt, Whole Towns are cast away in Storms, and wrackt; That feed like Canibals on other Fishes And serve their Coussen Germans up in Dishes: A Land that Rides at Anchor, and is moord, In which they do not live, but go abourd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POETICAL THESAURUS WIT AND FOLLY A man of Quick and Active wit For Drudgery is more unfit, Compard to those of Duller Parts, Then Running Nags to draw in Carts. Have wee not Built a Stately Colledge T' instruct Four Nations in all knowledge (Who now are Barbarus and Rude) As soon as once they are subdu'de? But what or where these Nations are Wee know as little as they care Nor when the Busnes wilbe don Unles th' are Colonies i' th' Moon. Fooles (like Philosophers) disdain All that's Impossible t' obtain, And b'ing incapable of wit Dispise, and undervalew it; And as the Greeks by Hors, and Bul, Discrib'd what s'ever 's great, and Full: So he that would discribe their wit By Horse and Bull must blazon it. —None but Sots Would put the Moon out for her Spots. No Asse 'Ere knew what kinde of Beast he was. Wit beare's no Rate but as it pleases: So Pearels in Fishes, are Diseases, And Perfumes of the Richest Sents In Beasts but sores, or excrements. Fancy in the Darke see's best When outward eies Discern the least. As we finde Small Partys are The fittest for Surprize in ware, So Feeble wits in Consultations Are best at Cavils and evasions. Wit and Prayse (like Salt and sweet In Cookery) can never meete. The Lives of th' old Philosophers of Greece, Were but their Apothegm's and Repartee's. For all their Actions Historys discover, Are what they us'd so often to say over. Dancers jog down all their wit Out of their Heads, into their Feet. The Ignorant and wise Are to each other of a Size; And both as nat'rally contemne The wise, th' Ignorant, and they them. Great wits have only been Preferd In Princes Traines to be interd; And, when they cost them nothing, Placd Among their Followers not the last; But, while they livd, were far enough From al Admittances kept of[f]. Wit Wil neither Love, nor money get. As Salt Rust[s] swords; so too much wit Debases valour when they meet. Th' one Half of wit's maintaind by Folly That finde's it Fresh supplys to Rally; For wit's unable to Invent What Idiots naturally vent. Wits who have little enough t' ingage, Are cold, before their time, to th' Stage. For these take measure of their own, That Cry all others Talent down. And by their own false Standards, try All others Ingenuity. One who had wanted long A Sphincter Mussle to his Tongue. So great a Thief, hee'd cut the wit From under a Smal Poets feet. All Prophesies that Rhime and Quible Are truer the[n] the Leaves of Sibil. Too much or too little Ingenuity and wit Do only render th' owners fit For Nothing, but to be undon Much easier, then if th' had none. Like Philosophers, A wittall Is with his Parts Content though ere so little; For hee believs, that has the least, Hee's better furnishd then the best. In th' Age of Turnaments, and Tilting All wit in Stiching lay and Quilting; When Men did weare their Prettyst Jests Imbroderd on their Backs and Brests, And None Invok'd a Muse or Phœbus, But to be Inspird with a Rebus; And He was Held the subtlest witted, Whose Motto, and Imprese best Fitted. From hence came Clinch, at first, and Quibble, At which the Revrend Men still Nibble, And hold their wit and Parts undon In overseeing of a Pun. When all our venerable Benches Gave Judgment and Pronouncd in Clinches, And he, who was but at a Loss, Was Counted very Dull and Gross; And none so worthy to sit there, As those who on a Poynt could Jeare. Next after these came Ends of Latin, Though now 'tis held but idle Prating, But then the Greates[t] Hight of Art To have most Sentences by Heart. For Nature never gave to Mortall yet A Free and Arbitrary Pow'r of wit, But bound him to the Good Behavior for't That he should never use it to do hurt. Most men are so unjust to looke upon Anothers wit as Enemy t' his own. For wit and Fancy, like a Diamond, The more exact, and curious, 'tis ground, Is forcd, for evry Caract, to abate, As much in valew, as it wants in weight. It is a harder thing for men to Rate Their own Parts at an æqual estimate, Then cast up Fractions, in th' Account of heaven, Of time, and motion, and Adjust them eaven: For modest Persons, never had a tru Particular, of all, that is their Due. All wit do's but Divert men from the Road, In which things vulgarly are understood, And Force Mistake and Ignorance to own A Better Sense, then commonly is known. For Men Learn sooner then they can Imagin, Take Folly and Ill habits by Contagion, And, as the Persons they converse with Hap, Catch Ignorance or Reason like a Clap And Propagate the epidemique Ach Which all the Rest of one another catch. As no Edge is accounted sharp and keene That by the subtlest Eie is to be seen, So no wit for Acute should be Allowd That's Plaine, and Easy to be understood. For those get least, that take the greatest Pains, But least of all i' th' Drudgery of Brains, A Natral Sign of weaknes, as an Ant Is more Laborius then an Elephant, And Children are more busy at their Play Then men that wisest pas their time away. LEARNING For what do's all Philosophy But teach men Learnedly to Ly? From false Grounds solidly t' infer And how Judiciously to erre, To universalls strech all Art Untill 'tis Lame in evry Part. What Nature had to human eies denyd, He with the optiques of his minde discry'd. Bookes and Schooles Made Few men wise, but worlds of Fooles. The History of Learning is so Lame; That 'tis unknown, from whence, at first it came: Or who Invented it; For th' old Ægyptian Do's only, claime a Title, by Præsc[r]iption, Time out of Minde; and the untutord Græcians, Were taught their Alphabet, by th' old Phœnicians. Whence some are Confident, The Hebrew-Jew Has better Right, to challeng, as his Due. Derivd from Adam: As their own Samboscer (The Rabins write) His Tutor was, and usher; Till many Ages after, Greece, and Rome, Were into Full Possession of it come. Whence some have thought; 'Twas but to call to minde Some Notions, left, in th' other world Behinde; And quite forgotten, in our Passage hither, Untill we Had Collected them, together. The Noblest Sense was never Learnt, nor taught But into this world with the owner brought As Naturally as a Part, or Limbe, That was Begotten, and grew up with him. From whence it was, The Antient world was wont T' ascribe Invention to some Gods Account. For there's no Liberal Art, nor Document That teache's how to Fancy and Invent. That's but a Natural Freehold of Merit Which only those wh' are born to can Inherit. Yet when The Freest Judgment, and first Starts Of Reason are the Signes of greatest Parts Some think they are but dainty Fruits that Drop, By Beast, or vermine to be Eaten up. The Faults of Language, are the variations, Of Dialects, and Moods, and Declinations, With æqual wants of Syntax, to Reduce, And make hang together, in their use. In which, the Nat'rall Temper of the Greek Is both the most Luxuriant, and to seeke. And yet their Sages, who are known, s' absurd, To put their Stress of Reason, on a word, Could never express exactly what they meant Untill they had Destroyd the Argument. In all mistakes, The Strickt, and Regular, Are found, to be the Desperatst ways to Erre: And worst to be avoyded, as a wound Is sayd to be, the harder Curd, that's Round: For Error and mistake the less th' Appeare In th' End are found to be the Dangrouser; As no Man mind's those Clocks that use to go Apparently to[o] over fast, or slow. More Proselyts, and Converts, use t' accrew To false Perswasions, then the Right, and true. For Error, and Mystake, are Infinite But Truth has only one way, to b' in the Right. As Numbers may t' Infinity be Grown But never be Reducd to less then one. The Stoiques believd, the Gods could do no good Nor Hurt, themselvs, but as the Fates allowd; But when they stickled for it, in their Porch, The Fates forsooke and left them in the lurch, Exposd them to maintaine it with the losses Of some mens lives, and others Eies, and Noses, And provd their own opinions, by their Fall, That some Mens virtu is an Animal. The Epicureans had no persuasion T' Imploy the Gods upon this worlds Creation; Believ'd 'twas Modeld not by Artifice But Fortune, and Haphazard, piece by piece; And to afflict 'em for their Ignorance Believd themselvs as Justly made by Chance, Until th' Athenians for their Principles Chargd them with luxury, and nothing else. So He that offers Nature best to know, Deny's the God[s], H' had made his Prayers to. Begs Venus t' use her Interest with Mars To Leave his Battles (for a while) and wars And, for his Patron Memmius, Intercede To be at leasure, what he sayd, to Read, But Presently conclude[s], The Gods Forbear To medle with our little Intrests here, And, when he makes the Heavy thing[s] ascend, Because the greatest Trees do upward tend, Forgot that Trees grow upward to their Hight When all the thin Attracted Parts are light. So he that put his Son to Socrates To learn to Prove, what ever, he should please, To pay his Debts with Arguments, chose rather To shew his skil in Beating of his Father, And after answer for it, in a Court, As he Design'd, and was acquitted for't. [Learned Men] Are wont to fortify the weakest Places Of all their Studies with the Hardest Phrases, Tho wholly unconcernd in Truth or Falshood But as they Chance to fall out for the Souls good But always Pin a Hebrew Alphabet Upon the Hangings where they use to eat; With Prints of Hieroglyphiques on the wals, With Kircher Box of whistles and Catcals, And many a Talismanical Device To Root out vermine with, and Rats and mice; Whose most Extempral and Careles Act Is stiffer then an antique Cataphract. No mathematician ever was Esteemd That had not been for Conjurer condemnd. The Metaphysique's but a Puppet Motion That go's with Screw's, the Notion of a Notion, The Copy of a Copy, and Lame Draught Unnaturally taken from a thought; That Counterfets all Pantomimique Tricks And Turnes the Eies, like an old Crucifix. That Counter Changes, whatsoe're it calls B' another Name, and make's it tru, or False. Turns truth to falshood, Falshood into Truth By vertu of the Babilonians Tooth. For Reason is not only found to Grow, But wast's, and weares out, with the Body too. Is Sickly, and In health, and Sleeps, and wakes, And whatsoere the Body feeles Partakes. When all their Reason[s] have but one Result, And that's Instinct, or Quality occult, That understand when Reason's at its Height, And when again Impertinent and slight; When it Approaches next to Demonstration, And when no Nearer then Imagination. If greatest Masters, ere they reachd their Height, Had not in Bungling, found as much Delight As After in their greatest Mastery, They never had Arrivd at that Degree. The Best Authority, instead of Reasons, Is but a Kind of Statute with Defeasance: For things that are Imperiously sayd Are but the sooner to be disobeyd. For all Inventions that the world Contains Were not by Reason first found out, but chance; But Pass for theirs, who had the Luck to light Upon them by Mistake, or oversight. A Language Dead can never be Restord So much to Life, to own a New made word; Were Tully now alive, Hee'd be to seek In all our Latin Tearms of Art, and Greek. Would never understand one word of Sense, The most Irrefragables[t] Schoolman means; As if the Schooles Designd their Tearms of Art Not to Advance a Science, but Divert; As Hocus-Pocus Conjures, to amuse The Rabble, from observing what he do's. The world had never been a St[r]aw the worse If it had never had Philosophers. For Metaphysique's but a kinde of Brandy Drawn out of Dead-wine Leeze, t' ingage, and bandy And yet wil serve Inceptors to Comence, And take Degrees, much easier then with Sense, To clabber-claw a tough and stuborn Theses To any Nonsense, either Party Pleases: For some Mens Fortunes like a weft or stray Are only Gained by losing of their way. So he that held th' Ete[r]nity of Nature In the next place, makes mention, of First matter; And after, to Interpret what he means, Put's on the words a Metaphisique Sense; Which some b' a second hand Mistake, have been So Confident, to take their Oaths, Th' have seene. For 'tis not strange for Disputants t' assert What both deny (Implicitly) by Art: The one to prove, the other, to Disclame, When both mistake themselves; and meane the same. The more men take upon them, and Profess To know all things, they understand the lesse; Who count it a Disparagment, and Shame To heare an unknown Booke, or Authors Name, Or aske the meaning of a word abroad, They never heard before, nor understood, For feare of being Suspected, For their want Of knowing all things, weake and Ignorant, The only course that never fayles, t' Advance, And fortify, their Nat'rall Ignorance. The Barbarousest Nations Adages Are wittyer, then those of Rome, and Greece, Which Pædants with their greatest Diligence Had rather breed their Pupils to, then sense. As Properer to fit the Idiom Of th' Antique Parrots and Jack-daws of Rome. The wits of Mankind are but subtle Spirits Designd to Hunt in th' underworld like Ferrets, But have no wings to Raise themselves and Fly Beyond their Altitude at things too High. For when the Circulation of the Bloud Tho ere so easy, was not understood, How should the world expect that things more hard Should ever be Discoverd afterward. ARTS AND SCIENCES Rules Were made for Novices, and Fooles. The old Ægyptians stered their Boats And Sayld down Cataracts of Spoats, Made Spectacles t' Improve the Sight And see i' th' Dark as wel as light. 'Tis strange how stubbornly industrious Some men are found t' appeare Preposterous, That spare no Drudgery, and Paines To wast their little stock of Braines, All Arts and Sciences perplex, And, with a thousand idle Freakes, The Government of Nature vex, And like Fanatiques in their Hearts Have visions, and New lights in Arts; From old Designes of water-engines Steal Gifts, and Lights of New Inventions, Make Pumps for water, and their wit, To Rayse 'em both so many feet, And forge their Gimcracks at the Rate Fanatiques use in Church, and State, And out of Antique Theorems New Jiggambobs of Light and Dreames. Smattrers are more Brisk and Peart Then those who understand an Art, As little spa[r]kles shine more bright Then Glowing Coales, that give 'em light, Whose sudden Vanitys and Flashes Are clouded by themselves with Ashes. 'Tis not the Art of Schools to understand, But make things Hard, in stead of b'ing explaind; And therefore Those are comonly, the Learnedst, That only study between Jest, and Earnest: For when the End of Learning's to Pursue, And trace, the Subtle steps, of false and true, They ne're consider how they are t' Apply, But only listen, to the Noyse and Cry, And are so much Delighted with the Chace, They never mind the Taking of their Preys. For Books are but a Kinde of Utensils Of Turning Children upon Potters wheels, That, when th' are ore'clogd with heavy men, Reduce 'em natrally to Boys agen. For Bookes were made for Men, not Men for Bookes, No more then Meat was made for dressing Cookes; Are Commonly the By-blows of an Author: Not one in Forty has an Honest Mother. PÆDANTS For Pædantry is But a Lewd Caprich Which Pupills Catch of Tutor's like the Itch; And many nere Recover, till th' are Men, But still grow worse till th' are twice Boys agen; That in the world at first was Introducd As but the Garbe, and meen, that Schollers usd, But since is so Inlargd it has outgrown The usefull Part of all that's to be known, And in its Roome Imported Affectations Of Obsolete, and Antiquitated Fashions; From whence the virtuoso-wit of France Do's not oppose to knowledg, Ignorance [But] Pædantry, as th' Horribler Defect And Imperfection of the Intellect. Besides the Crambe-Surfets of his Parts Diseasd, and Cropsick, with his Nauseous Arts: For all a Pædants Skill Ly's in his Tearms As conjurers and witches in their Charms, That never Speaks, But Consters, and Imbr[o]thers The Bumbast-Stuff, with Ends of Antique Authors More Insignificant, then Osce, and Volsce, Or Modern Macaronique Linsy-wolse, The Constant Pedlers Dialect, of Schoolers Patcht up with Scraps, of Diffrent Stufs, and Cullers, More Tawdry then a Botchers Chequerd Cushion He Sings, and stiches with his Legs a Cross-on, And (like a Fripprer) do's but Turn and Dress The wrong-side out-wards sevrall Languages Of which He smatters greater Stores at once Then th' Antique Hundred voyces could Pronounce. So He that usd to set the Highest valews Upon a word, of Meane Condition, Alius, A Paltry Epithite Prizd it beyond The Richest Jewells meerly, for the Sound, And Counted those the Eloquentst Clarks That Frequentst Introduct it, in their works. A Tru Pedantique writer in a worke Wil manage all his matters with a Fork And not omit the least Puntilio That might his Breding and Good-manners show. As Formall as a Ceremonious Author Quote's the Right worshipful his Elder Brother. A Pædagogue, that mounted in his Schoole Is but a Kinde of Master of Misrule, Is Puft up with his own conceipt, and Swels With Pride and vanity and Nothing else, Like Bladders in the Late Pneumatique Engine, Blown up with nothing but their owne Extension. And when he speak's in Languages unknown To those that hardly understand their own, Talke's to himself, as other madmen use, And only is Permited to go loose. For Pædants teach their youth, to Apprehend And take their Lessons in at the wrong end; And when they'r sick, have been præscribed by Leaches For exercise, to Labour at their Breeches. VIRTUOSO Logitians use to clap a Proposition, As Justices do Criminals, in Prison; And in as Learnd Authentique Nonsense writ, The Names of all their Moodes and figures fit; For a Logician's one, that has been broke To Ride and Pace his Reason by the Booke, And by their Rules, and Precepts, and Examples, To put his wits into a kind of Trammells. For as the Famous Trismegist, B' observing of a Beast that Pist, Is sayd t' have first found out a way To Reckon evry Howr o' th' Day, And, when he had the water Cast, Could tell Correctly how time Past, So some, by Chamber Pots and Glasse[s], Can tell as truly how time Passes; And, as the Tides of Liquor Run, Can Calculate the Course o' th' Sun, And [that] More Certain and exact Then all the Tricks i' th' Almanack. Until our Modern Curious virtuosos, By only knocking at the Doores of Houses, Will, by the Sound, unriddle the Just Sum How many Persons are in the Roome. Take Ptolomy That Liv'd in Adrian's Days For some Ægyptian King of th' antique Race And Joyn him with his Colleague in the Stars Alphonso Sovraine of Astronomers. And when no Atom in the universe The wit of Man (beyond the Name) can Pierce It has (like Powder of a Diamond) The Hardest Parts of Nature, Cut, and Ground, And taught men to Discerp and Penetrate All Form, and matter, simply as they say't. When al his wit's unable to unriddle The wonders of the Magnete, and the Needle That makes the Globe o' th' Earth a Thoroughfare To pass as Quick as Light dos through the Aire And at a Race of Motion to out-run And beat the Jaded Horses of the Sun. ANTIQUITY A little wit, and Reason's Necessary To Qualify an able Antiquary; Who has no Busnes for the Intellect But to Transcrible and Copy, and Collect; Is but an Antiquated Ghost that Haunts The Charnel-Houses of the Antients And calls the Dead Deponents up, to Answer And solve all Questions of the Necromancer, But has a Prejudice to all that's New Though 'ere so useful, Rational, and Tru; When al the Antients understood before The Moderns have improvd, and somthing more. As if Books, like a China-Potters Clay, Prepard for th' use of After-ages lay, And Time, that can the Hardest things devour, Ore Feeble Age and Error had no Power, And that which stubbornst Adamants can break Turnd Edge against the most infirme and weake. The Antients Had no Folios, nor Pages That have been since found out, by after Ages, Were Nice of Forraine words, and Affectations, Of Far-fet, and outlandish Imitations. Disdaind to Copy, and Translate, and Quote, And if they would, they Had no way to do't. Had not so much, as Indexes, to looke, And finde out what, they sought for, in a Booke. Knew nothing of a Table to an Author T' examine, and Discover what they sought for: But had a freer way of Sense, and wit, In all they left, of what they sayd, or writ. Had not so many Languages to Purchace, As Men are now Ingaged in, to no Purpose. For if the world Grow Elder ev'ry howr Since the Creation, then it was before, The Modern Ages wilbe found, to bee The Best Pretenders, to Antiquity. When all the Antique Globe of Heavn Containd Was but the furniture of Sea, and Land; And Men, and Beasts, and Birds, and Fish and Foul Was but an Inventory of the whole; The Orbes but Nests of Boxes, to Inclose And Shut up Nature fast, from Breaking loose; Whence al their Learned Men were of Opinion Nothing could Represent them better then an Inion That, in the Judgment of Philosophers, [Were] Natral Types of al the universe. The Antients in their writings are not found To be the least Pedantique, and Hide-bound. The Antients Layd up Stores of all Provisions Of Common Places, Topiques, and Transitions. For most men take their Learning upon Tick, From the Antient Roman, or the Elder Greek: And for the Revrence due to Age, believe It ought to have the sole Prerogative; And therefor whatsoere it do's, or says, The world is bound, Implicitly to Pass. For nothing is esteemd so Learnedish As t' Imitate the Antients, tho Amis. Who when in Publique Roads, Th' Interd the Dead, Mad[e] Epitaphs, for Passengers to Read, Which wee, to Imitate Antiquity, To Travellers through Churches now Apply, And Dedicate to all that Pass that Roade, To keep the Antique Custome up, and Mode. So when the Senate, and the States of Rome Were wont to Rayse (for Nations over-come) Triumphal Arches, to their Emperors, The Moderns do it to themselvs, of course: And when an Antique Book was but a Scroule, They usd (like Maps) about a Stick to Roule, And for the more Convenience of their use, Were faine to Frequent Sections to Reduce, Things that are now Impertinent, and vaine Which we have now no use of, yet retaine: The Moderns to preserve the Fashions, Reckon The Length of all their writings by the Section. As when the Antients counted Shepherds fit, To Pass for Men of Quick, and Ready wit, Though now the Ablest is as great a Dunce As any other Sort of Rugged Clownes, Wee to conform, write Eglogues in their Names To vindicate the Title of their Clames, Because No Sheep can shew so great a Stock Of Magots, as a Pastral Poets Flock: And Sillily have made to Sing, and Pipe, Of all Perfections else a Standing Type: So Aristotle was at first Debard All Christian Schooles, yet Counted Afterward The Schoolmens only Oracle, and Chief Apostle of the Mystrys of Belief: A Paradox not only against the Grain Of all their own Opinions, but in vaine. For why should they Reduce Belief to Proof, If it be stronger when 'tis further off? That's Necessary, by their own Confession, If Faith have more Authority then Reason? The Antients left the world more wise and Learnd Then After ages when their Books were burnd And other Barbarous writers in their Places Supplyd the world with all their Sottish Trashes. HISTORY Th' Ægyptian Pyramids were first Begun Upon the same Designe with Babilon T' avoyd an Inundation and Deliver The Founders from the Deluge of their River. The Antients held no act Adul[t]erous That was Committed in a Common house. Medea in a Pot could Stew Decayd old Age to youth anew, And could with herbs and spices season A youthfull Ragoust of old Æson; Yet half his Cunning had she not, That Could renew the very pot. The British Language has no word T' express a River but a Sword; As if their swords much antienter And long before their Rivers were, And war more Natural then th' earth Or Elements that brought them forth. When Adam had eaten the forbidden fruite, Of Leaves he made him a sligh[t] Summer suite; But, being Banishd Eden for his Sins, To labour like a Clown, h' was clad in Skins. Lik Stow and Hollinshead who tell us where The King did keep his Christmas evry yeare. The Antient Jews did morne in sackcloth As now the Christians do in black cloth. The antient Picts made feasts [Of] Sheperds Bums and womens brests. For who but Fooles and Knaves possess Those Antient Stately Pallaces, Of Bethlem Sion, and Bridewell, Where Princes heretofore did Dwell? In Spaine [T]hey count theyr yeares From Tubalkain, [Th]e Patriarch of Iron Trades, [T]hat Forgd Toled' and Bilbo-blades. A Roman Prætor, as he led His Army through the Gates of Rome, Had hornes appearing on his head: Which was interpreted if ere he Come Within the wals of Rome againe He wilbe crownd a King and Reigne. A great Philosopher did choke With laughing at a Jest he broke. Th' Embassador of France, Tooke out the Queen of Spain to dance And after made a vow, and Swore He'd never dance with Lady more After so great a Queen had daygned To let him take her by the hand. In Rome no Temple was so low As that of Honor, built to shew [How] Humble Honor ought to bee, Though there 'twas all Authority. The great Saint Lewis, king of France, Fighting against Mahometans, In Ægipt, in the holy war, Was routed and made Prisoner. The Sultan then, into whose hands He and his Army fell, demandes A thousand weight of gold, to free And set them al at Liberty. The king pay's down half o' th' nayle, And for the other offers bayle The Pyx, and in't the Eucharist The Body of our Savior Christ. The Turk considerd, and allowd The Kings Security for good; Such Credit had the Christian Zeal In those days with an Infidell, That wil not pass for two pence now Among themselves, 'tis faln so low. The Mores believe Granada Ly's Directly under Paradise, And that they differ both no more Then th' upper Roomes do from the Floure. The Antients payd respect and wonder To Trees or Person[s] struck with Thunder. Was not king Dor forcd by the Tartar To Keep Swine for a year and quarter, And after being restord againe Injoyd a Long and glorious Reigne? Indians of Siam (Authors write) Instead of Black do mourn in white. The Spartans, that were held of all the Græcians Most thrifty of their Language, and Expressions That could indure no length of Circumstance Yet cald themselves Lacedæmonians. Chineses took the Busnes most unkinde To see their Cuntry in our Maps designd, And mad[e] the Skirts of all the universe, Which they mistook to be the same to theirs. So all Inferiors of that Cuntry use Before their Betters to Pull of[f] their shoes: And [when] two æqualls civilly Salute, Neither wil yeld to take the upper Foot. So those that at the Battle of Cressy, make Theyr Bowstrings with a Showr of Rain, to slake Were Ignorant of Nature, to forget They were Contracted rather by the wet. Else th' Ingineres of Rome that strov to Rayse A great Aguglio, firm upon his Base, Their Cables b'ing too long, had fayld, if Nature Had not Retrencht them, when th' were drencht in water. Th' old Romans us'd to match, and pair Their servants with great Art and Care; Were critically exact to see Their Statures, and their Years agree; To match the colour of their Hair, The black with black, and fair with fair; And accurately fit, and size Their Mouths, their Noses, and their Eyes; And made them wear their Limbs, and Faces For Liv'rys of the self-same Laces. ABSURDITIES De Scudery make's Turks at Sea-shipt Sayl through the Baltique Sea to Ægypt. Predictions are but like Devises At Lotterys to draw all Prizes. Russian wives believe th' are usd Unkindely till th' are Drubd and bruisd. An Asse will with his long eares fray The Flys, that tick[l]e him, away; But Man delight's to have his eares Blown Magots in by Flatterers. At Saint Thomas Waterings Where men a[re] Angled for, with Strings And many a Tory-Navigator Choakd like a Fish with Hemp in water. The world has Long Indevord to Reduce Those things to Practice, that are of no use, And strive's to Practice things of Speculation And bring the Practicall to Contemplation. And by that Error, Renders both in vaine By forcing Natures Course against the Graine. What sort of Creature Summum Bonum was, Philosophers Describe, so like an Ass. If virtue were an Animall determine Or vice, but Insects, and Imperfect vermine. So Church Historians undertake to Tell Where Th' Hous stands yet, of an old Parable. And shew the Ruines of the Habitation, Of th' Antient Morall, and Interpretation: So most Religious Men have nothing else In all their Historys, but Miracles; When No Believer would Indure the Falshood Of what they write, but only for the Souls good; And Nature do's far greater Miracles Then all their Deviations from her else. A Roman Magistrate was made Supreme, Only to Knock a Naile into a Beame. So that wise virtuoso Sydrophel, Who in a Publique Tax is sayd t' appeale, And show how much he had bee[n] over-reckond To pay a Tenth for but a third, or second. The Germans when a Boy do's grow Fit for the wars: wil not allow His manhood, til he's kickt i' th' Arse And then he's listed for the wars. So Russian Lambs (some write) are wont to travel, Instead of Four-Lege's, only with a Navel: That Rooted in the Earth, both Feeds, and Grows, And eates the Grass on both sides as He goes. Some Deaf men (they say) see words If those that speake 'em have no beards; Others can heare a violin Holding between [their] teeth a Pin. Like him that drew th' Invisible Mountain Which all Philosophy do's Containe, Or like the Painter that designd A Noyse, or he that drew the winde. CUSTOME Custom is (like the moone's) Inconstant, vain, And always shifting 'twixt the Ful and wane: Was never known to weare one certaine face, And twice apeare to be the same it was, And therefore 'tis no Miracle, mens mindes Are to themselves more various then the winds. For as 'tis Natural for use and Custome To Reconcile things ere s' averse and Loathsom (As Ragusts of a Basilisque or Toad By Custome have been Renderd wholsom food) So use can make an obstinate Practician Do Feats beyond an ordinary Magician; As in Mechanique Practices the Hand Can See, and Hear, and Judge, and understand, And ev'ry finger in the Dark, finde out The Subtlest Mathematique Poynt by Rote, As Blinde men when they Play upon an Harp Unsight unseen, can hit a Flat or Sharp; And when that Fatal Desperate Impostume Contagious, and Pestilential Custome Is but Possest of any vital Part, The Remedy is Past the Cure of Art. To prove by Syllogism's but to spel A Proposition like a Syllable. OPINION Who dos not know with what fierce Rage Opinions Tru, or False ingage? And, 'cause they Govern all Mankind, Like the Blindes Leading of the Blinde, All Claime an equal Interest Of free Dominion, ore the Rest. And as one Shield, that fell from Heaven, Was Counterfeited by Eleaven, The Better to Secure the Fate And lasting Empyre of a State; The False are Numerous, and the tru, (That only have the Right) but Few. Hence Fooles, that understand them least Are Still the Fiercest in Contest; Unsight, unseen, espouse a Side, At Random, like a Princes Bride, To Damn their Soules, and Sweare and ly for And, at a venture, Live and Dy for. The Great Des Cartes with long thought and Study Had Run himself, out of his Soul, and Body: Had Forfeted the world, and what's in't, Till he Recoverd al, and more, b' a Hint. For since he could not think, He did not think, Found out, his Soul, and He were things Distinct; When Really 'twas not his Soul, and Hee, That differd, but his Supposd No Body. Opiniasters Naturally Differ From other men, as woodd[en] legs are Stiffer Then those of Plyant Joynts, to yeld and Bow Which way so ever th' are Designd to Go. That make Belief and Knowledge the same Case Because on tick both equally wil Pass And since th' are chargd on equal Principles Believe they are the same in al things else. Opinion governs all Mankind, Like the Blind's leading of the Blind; For he, that has no Eyes in 's Head, Must be b' a Dog glad to be led; And no Beasts have so little in 'em As that inhuman Brute, Opinion. 'Tis an infectious Pestilence, The Tokens upon Wit and Sense, That with a venemous Contagion Invades the sick Imagination; And, when it seizes any Part, It strikes the Poyson to the Heart. This Men of one another catch By contact, as the Humours match; And nothing's so perverse in Nature, As a profound Opiniaster. And as the Chast Penelope Unraveld all sh' had don by day When Night arrivd; so do's shee too, And all sh' had don before, undo. NONSENSE What Art have Jewellers t' Improve a Stone Unles with Dust and Powder of its own? For things Abhominable in Conversation, Will Pass in Bookes, for Modish, and in Fashion: As German Authors first found out the Trick T' Articulate their New Nicknames in Greek, And Mercers use to give a Rotten Stuffe A New hard Name, to go the easier off. That servs our modern Authors here to face The Titles of their workes, like Copperlace. Though Art, and Nature's no more Different, Then Characters from things they Represent: And when the one's exactly tru Designd It is but copyd from the other kinde To cheat Philosophers, who think th' are Matters Of sevrall kindes, and Disagreeing Natures, When Art has nothing Excellent, and Good, But what the Laws of Nature have allowd: Yet Learned men have sevral Scales, to weigh All that they write, Distinct, from what they say, As other Tradsmen, that in measures deale, Have long to buy withall, and short to sell: That b'ing compard together only Differ The more Elaborate, is but the Stiffer: Write things in Heats, which in the colder Bloud Of Fancy are not to be understood. The more they treat of things Methodically Do but the [more] impertinently dally And by Referring things that are most hard, To Proper Heads, nere mind them afterward. Believe that no man can be in the wrong, That is mistaken in a Learned Tongue. The very Sound o' th' Language is enough To keep all ordinary Censure off. Th' Ignorant World without Distinction, lookes On all, that Passe's on th' Accompt of Booke's; And when there are two Scollers, that within The Species only, hardly are of kin; The world wil pas for men of equall knowledg, If equally th' have Loyterd in a Colledge. The Curiousest Judgment's apt to loose The vigor of it's Sense, with too much use; For Mules at once, wil Travel, Eate, and Sleep Upon a Road, they have been usd to keep. Was not our Cuntry-man, the Great Manage The Noblest virtuoso of the Age? Before Morinus, a Cadet-Physitian Exchangd Professions, with a Mathematician, Who spent a whole week to Convince his Brother, But, in the End, Converted one another; And, while the one Maintaind, what th' other doubted, Both got the victory, yet both were Routed. The Prince of Syracuse, whose Destind Fate It was to Kepe a Schoole, and Rule a State, Found that his Scepter, never was so Awd, As when it was translated to a Rod; And that his vassals nere were s' obedient, As when he was Inaugurated Pedant: Whence those that use to teach the Liberal Arts, Are Princes al and Tyrants in their Hearts. And look as wise as if like Prester John Th' had been begotten al by Solomon: For to Instruct is greater then to Rule And no Command's Imperious as a School. For no Infatuations are so Bad As theirs, who to Improve themselves, Run Mad. As if to teach, were nothing but to Part With something of their Native Sense, and Art; Or put their Ingenuity to sale To those th' Instruct, by outcry, or Retayle. For the best Characters of Ignorance Are vanity, and Pride, and Arrogance; As Blind men use to bear their Noses higher Then those that have their Eiesight most Intire. As Campanella usd to screw and wrest His face like Theirs, to whom he then Addrest, And allways found he had the best Success, When best he did it, most of all to Please: So Famous writers think their very Looks Will ad a great Advantage to their Books; And therefore, when they put their works in Print, Their Pictures are the first things handled in't. [Cardan] that Admird Italian Doctor wrot His Parents Frenzies, when he was begot; Told how his Sire lookd one way, and his Mother In th' Act, when they committed him, another, For feare of b'ing surprizd, and taken, in So Infamous a Place, and Lewd a Sin. That in the Eies of th' Embrio, did Imprint The Native Signature he had, to Squint: And how their Hugs, and Locks, had Sprain'd his Toos They never could be fit, for any Shoos All which Past well; because such kinde of Freakes Had been Committed once by th' Antique Greeks; And since, some Later writers of Romances Have Matchd it with their Plagiary Fancies, Whose Great Examples have been thought enough To Justify Extravaganter Stuff. The Antients thought, that Men and Goats drew th' Aire To set their Longs on work, at either Eare; But whether that were but a Flam or Tru The Devil any of them ever knew! TRUTH Things Determind by most voyces Are not the Greatest Truths, but Noyses. All wise men should be just as kinde To Truth, as Truth to them they finde. For Peace, and Truth are found t' unite As Nat'rally, as to Ly and Fight; And Therefor when they Battle wage The Ly's the Signal to engage. To fight for Truth, is but the Sole Dominion Of ev'ry Idiot's Humor or Opinion, And what it fancy's Truth, maintaine's By ventring t' Hardest Blows, his Braine[s]; And he, whose Noddle is most tough, Demonstrate's with the Clearest Proof. For Naked Truth like naked women Is Impudent, Deboshd, and Common, A more Prodigious thing appeare Then Truth would to a Princes eare. For Truth and Kings have fierce Contests About their Pow'r, and Interests; And therefore by their Ministers Are never sufferd to Converse But Parted, as the Persian King And Queen were, for the Selfsame thing And by their servants at a Fitting, Convenient Distance, kept from meeting. Truth can be no older then The first original of men But Lying is much Antienter Ever since the Fall of Lucifer Who, b'ing the Patriarch of Lys, Then Raisd those older Family[s]. For Truth is no Original, but Lines Drawn Perfectly from Natures own Designes; And t' understand Truth is not to be wise, But to unriddle all intrigue of Lies. And some have doubted whether Knights of the Post Or Natural Historians Lie most, Have no Regard to Truth in All they write, But file their Forgerys the more Polite. The End of Learning's only to Persue The ways of Truth within and out of view, To Copy out th' Originals of Nature As Far as Human wit can Imitate her, And draw a Scheam exactly in the minde T' agree with that shee in the world Designd. For Truth do's stand in Need of no Excuse; Or if it did, 'Twould serve it to no use; That never Suffers on its own Account, But some things else that has been Layd upon't. Nothing a Tryal undergoes Without some Injury, and Loss, And cannot be prov'd true without The charge and trouble of the Doubt. The World's occasions cannot be supplyd With too much Truth and Reason on it's side; Is fain to take in Falshood, Fraud, and Error, To sell its own Commodities the dearer. For Truth, that is supreme and absolute, Must not be brought to question and dispute; But, like the sovran pow'r of Principles In Arts, and Sciences, try all things else, And not to any other Pow'r alive Submit its Int'rest, and Prerogative; Nor suffer any other Law to try The dictates of its high Authority. PHYSIQUE No Nation has such Physical Liefhebbers As th' English swarme withal, among their Neighbors, Where evryones Delight, as wel as Study, Is to store-up all medecines, for Mans Body. That serves them for their Natural Diversions, And Entertainment, of al other Persons. And this by People of all Trades, and Ranks, As if th' had beene Design'd for Mountebanks. For as the Antient Empriques, usd to lay Their Patients in the Publiquest High-way, T' have evry mans opinion, that past by, About the Sick mans Cure, and malady, The selfsame Course, our modern Patient[s] take, And all they meet with, their Physicians make. For all Pretender[s] of the virtuosos, Turn Doctors when the[y] do but talk of Doses. A Cook, an Host, an Herb-woman; or Nurse Are all Licentiats in the Art, of Course, A Barber for a Surgeon is Allowd But turns all-Doctor, when [he] lets men Bloud, And He, that has the least acquaintance Tampers With Sickmen, in their very Beds, or Chambers, Where those that are but talkative enough, Præscribe a Medcine when they hear him cough. No Parson did his office for the sick, But gave it over and turnd Emperique. So he that had been cured by Flys, that Got By Chance, into the medcine, and the Pot, But when the Dose was spent: He sent for more With those black Creatures in't, he tooke before. For universal Medcines are a Trick That Nature never Meant, to Cure the Sick, Unless by Death the Singular Receipt To Root out all Diseases by the Great, For universals deal in no one Part Of Nature, Nor Particulars of Art, And therefore That French Quack that Set up Physique, Cald his Receipt a General Specifique: For tho In mortal Poysons, evry one, Is Mortal universally alone: Yet Nature never made an Antidot, To Cure them all, as Easy as th' are Got; Much less, among so many variations, Of Diffrent Maladys, and Complications: Make all the Contrarieties of Nature, Submit themselves t' an Equall Moderator. A Farrier is a Doctor, nere the worse, For Shooing, and for Curing of a Horse: That dos not only fit him, with his shoos But when Hee's sicke, Administer a Dose. For nothing but their own Indispositions, Are Dangerous, and Fatall to Physitians. For all the Good they can pretend to do Are but for ostentation meant, and show. The Frequentst Leprosys, and b'ing Possest With Inmate Devils, at the same time ceast. For to examine Pulses, or cast water, Are but to pump Diseases hid by Nature. For Sickmen are no Patients held until They take the Medcine, as the Greater Ill. Like those that catch Diseases, with Conceipt, And Cure them, with a charme, or Amulet. For Empriques torture worse then Hangmen, To Rescue members from the Gangreen: And operators slash, and Mangle, To cure Inflamd Sores, when they Rancle. Whose Remedys are little lesse Then th' Insupportablest Disease, Recover wounds with greater Cuts, And Cure with Bullets, twisted Guts. Like him, who Nicely eate his Meals, And Nonchons in a Pair of Scales. And did not only Drink, and Eate, But Pist, and went to stoole, by weight. A Dog, that Grazes when hee's sick: Is th' only Natrall Emperique. Is't not the Greatest Art of State, To make those wh' are so obstinate, And mad upon their own undoing, That nothing can Preserve from Ruine: But by Diverting of these Freaks, To save them, that would break their Necks? And bring them back into their Senses, With faire, and Plausible Pretences? Whom all the Plainest Truth, and Reason, Had nere been strong enough to ceaze on? For nothing else in Nature's able, To Rescue from it self, the Rabble, With whom, there's Nothing Tru, or wise Will ever Pass, but in Disguise, And when th' are Mad, and Peremptory, Prescribe a whimsy, or a Story: And with mere Rallery, Impose Health, better then the luckyst Dose: And, with it self, Recover a Disease, More Natral then sovrainst Recipes. So Cardan cur'd himself of making mone Perpetual for the Hanging of his Son, And put an End, to all his whinneling, By Pissing only through a wedding-Ring. For nothing is more trite, and ordinary, Then shifting Medcines, by th' Apothecary That wants a Simple, in a Doctor's Bill, And put's in those, for any other Ill. For when the Doctor doubts of the Disease His best opinion's Cross, or Pile, to guess. Whence men are brought to Desprater Dist[r]esses, By catching Physique rather then Diseases: Whence 'tis observd they frequently Recover As soon as Doctors do but give them over. For when the sickly Body, and the Soul Do chance to fall on one another, Foul: Their Busnes is to talke Secundum Artem And, to Compound the Controversy, Part 'em. For 'tis not what th' have don, but what th' have earnd That makes the best Physitians, and most Learnd. And when there are but one, at most in Ten That Nature takes for Tithes, of all Sick men, Unles it be in Epidemique Aches When Nature makes the violentst Dispatches The Rest miscarry, for the greatest Part, By usinge too much, or too little Art. And by their own Neglects, or vain Excess Destroy themselves, instead of the Disease. The French hold Guicciardine, the best Historian, For treating civilly their Native Murrian: And Placing most impartially, The Staples Of that great Factory, at first, at Naples. For Nature when she's bent to do her Part, Acts more Effectuall, then the Greatest Art. That but Diverts the Course, she meant to take, And sets her Few, but better Medcines back: For who can tell what Nature would have don If sh' had been cald in to her self alone? A Doctor's sick of evry mans Disease And cure's himself first, with his Recipes And when he cuts and Slashes, and Dissects 'Tis only to finde out his own Defects. NATURE Leake's like a Tub and not a Boat: For th' one Runs in, and th' other out. The Sphere of Vapours rule's the Aire, And makes the weather foul, or fayre. The Moon do's never dare t' appeare In Heaven while the Sun is Neare, But still the further of[f] he goes The more her borrowd Splendor shows, And when shee's gotten opposite Set's up with all her borrowd light. Fishes with Scales are tyl'd about Like Houses to keep water out. An Army and a Populous Town Infected with the Plague's all one. Men's cornes are wont, before a Shour of Raine, But never when th' are in't, to be in Paine. So woodcocks that are Cullord like Dead Leaves The Crafty Fowler easily deceives. So in the western Sea of Spain, The Sun Is like a Taper, put out and go's down. That in a moment shines, and then go's out, As th' Antients in his Sea-Bed-Chamber thought. A single Feather breaks a Horses back And Drops of water greatest vessels wrack. Sleep that wearyd Life Redeemes Is fed with vaine and Idle Dreames. The most Divine of all the works of Nature Was not to make Model, but the Matter; As men may Build without Designs and Rules But [not] without Materials, and Tooles. A Salmon is both Bow and Arrows That is both Shot himself and carrys. The Lady (like a Fishes Row) had Roome For such a Shole of Infants in her wombe. Nature Denys Brute Animals expression Because they are Incapable of Reason. Punaises have as great a Brood I' th' Natives heads as in their wood, And multiply no where in France So numerous as the Peoples Braines. Pretious Stones not only do Foretel The Dire Effects of Poyson but Expel. When no one Person's able t' understand The vast stupendious uses of the Hand, The only Engin helpes the wit of Man To bring the world in Compass of a Span, From Raysing mighty Fabriques on the Seas To filing Chaines to fit the Necks of Fleas. The Left Hand is but Deputy to th' Right That For a Jorney man is wont t' imploy't. The moon herself do's never steal the Light She Pilfers from the Sun, but in the Night. For tho the Moone's Commandres of the Seas And all her various, Diffrent Nations sways, She never yet, has, at the ful, been sayd To make her Natral Subjects, Fishes mad, Like those that, out of her Supreme Command, Are Born, and Bred, and live upon the Land. Weeds grow of themselvs as Natrally As noble Plants degenerate and Dy. All Beasts, and Foules forsake their yong, They had been so tender of so long: As soon, as once they have no Need Of further Help, to shift, and Feed. In all the yeare, The Day and Night Have less of Darknes, then of Light In twilights, and the Dawnes of Suns Besides six months of Shining Moons. The light below, and upper-Darknes dy The Naturall Blew Tincture of the Sky For all the Heat, and light we finde appeare, Extends no further then the Atmosphere: The Rest all Darknes, only where the Moon, And other Planets, entertaine the Sun; That Hold no more Proportion to the whole, Then Glo-worms Tayles, or Sparcles of a Cole. Some guess the Earth is but a shell And all the Inner Concave Hell Th' Infernall Dungeons, and Dark holes Of Reprobate Departed Soules, Which Poets call the Stygian Lake From whence no Traveller Comes back. Water's the Clepsydra, to Cast How many yeares the world wil last. As an Arrow in the Sky Do's, like the Bow that shot it, fly, And make an Arch, so al things else Conform, stil to their Principles. Al Phænomenas May be expounded several ways. Nature permit's the mungrel Breed Of Mules, No further to proceed, For there's but one in evry Race, Begotten between Horse and Ass: Which makes the sons of zealous Saints, To prove the greatest Miscreants. And great Philosophers to think Al fooles begot in Love, or Drink. The Sunne-beames When they are empty will descend But when th' are Loaded upwards tend. Vermine were th' Originals of Cheats, As Spiders first taught men the use of Nets, And Lobsters first taught Armorers their Trade And how the Joynts of Cuiraces are made. A Madman's stronger in his Fits, But Drunkard less then in his wits, So much do Natral Parts Disdaine To vaile t' an Artificiall Braine. 'Tis sayd of vipers when they Breed The Femal bite's of[f] the Males head, Which th' yong-ones back in Kinde Repay And through her Bowels eate their way. Prop that cannot stand alone Grow's firm by being leand upon. No Water of it self do's Run Untill 'tis melted by the Sun. The Moon, by striving to out run And get the better of the Sun, Is lost herself, and all her Light Ecclips'd and vanish'd out of Sight. That silly Meteor Som call the Falling of a Star, That, 'till it fals, is never seen, Shines, and is out, as soon as in. Without the Tale of Numbers, Birds are wont To keep of Time, an exquisite Account Can cast up all their Recconings, How long They are to sit, before they hatch their yong. And all that while, can tell at what a Clock The Hen's expected to Relieve the Cock. To Recreate his wearynes, and when He is to do the same thing for the Hen. As Time is Accuratly told by Clocks That know not how to Reckon their own Strokes. Female Asses are more tall And sturdy then the silly Male. Nature Do's all her work by Fire and water, The two Divine Antagonists By whose Contests the world subsists. The Western Coasts of Wales, and Spaine Exposd to th' Indian Ocean; Have Mountaines, like Redouts, designd To breake the Fury of the winde, And turning of them, sevral ways, Divert the Storms, those vast Seas Raise. The Sun Appear's more glorious and Great The nearer he Approaches to his Set. As vaine as Dead men, when they have been drownd, Swim Nat'rally, when 'tis too late, on Grownd. The most Pacifique Seas with greatest Rage Encounter when in Narrow streits, th' Engage. Those Pigs the Devil did Posses Mistook themselves, for Porc-pisces And Ran into the Sea to finde, And mix with others of their kinde. Navigation, that withstood The Mortal Fury of the Floud And Prov'd the only Meanes to save All Earthly Creatures, from the wave, Ha's for it Taught the sea, and winde, To lay a Tribute on Mankind: That, by Degrees, has Swallowd more Then all it Drownd, at once before. The wounded whale dos Run on Shore The Salt sea vexes him so Sore, And Rather Runs himself on Ground Then to endure the Torment of his wound. No other members have those Graces As Eies, and—to be kept in Cases; And since, no others can import Mankind so much are kept like Jewels for't. A Stone that is but cast into a Pond Without a Compas, make's a Circle Round. Some Sorts of Fishes, only with the Tongue, (As virtuoso's say) Beget their yongue. As if the Greatest Mastery of Art Were only against Nature to take Part, Believe all knowledg of the Growth of Nature To be like the Rough unpolishd Matter And Art the Form, that bring's into being Though Spoild with Ignorance, and over-seing. As that Great Critique of the Trade took motion To be a Natural thing and not a Notion. A Horses Teeth are Ephemerides And calculate their own Nativities. An Ignis Fatuus against its Nature Instead of Burning 's wont to Duck in water. One Fish is but another Fishes vittle By Nature and the Sea, layd up in Pickle. The Hebrews, Spanyards and the Antique Welch Do not Pronounce their Languages, but Belch; And from the very Bottoms of their Throats Fetch up their Close and Intimatest Thoughts. All Arts and Arms of Excellence and worth Are now the Native Products of the North, Though their Originals were of the Growth And Manufacture only of the South, Which made the Ægyptians beare away the Glory Of all Inventions (Right or wrong) in Story, And al the learnedst Antiquarys writ The South's the worlds left Hand the North's the Right. Art is in vain unles it takes its Lesson From Nature or her Secretary Reason. For Nature gave an Ass the longer Eare The Charming Accents of his Brays to hear. Our Food is but a Medcin that Revive's The Natural Consumption of our Lives. Nature has placd so glorious a Shew Of other worlds and Suns within our view That only tempt us with Desire to know Without the Possibility of how; And, since th' are Placd beyond our own concern, Allows us no Capacity to Learn. For Stars of the first Ma[g]nitude appeare The least of all to those that view 'em here. The Sun and water at so vast Immeasurable a distance plac't Are both espous'd to one another, He nature's father, she her mother; And by the mixtures of their seeds Fill sea and land with various breeds. Guns do not Hurt, by making of a noyse; It is the Silent Bullet that destr[o]y's. As some Affirme A Bever, and his Taile, Is each a Diffrent Sort of Animall; And tho they seem by Nature of one Piece, The one is Perfect flesh, the other Fish: And therefore in his House, The Beast do's ly Above the waters Top, one Story high, Altho his Tayle would mortify, and Gangreen Without a Constant watry Cell to hang in. Hair is the Native excrement of seed That on the Cranion is observd to Breed, And the[re]fore, when the Sperm do's first Decay, The Hair fals of[f] or else turns grey: Whence 'tis untimely Discontents and Cares Bring men as Naturally to Grey haires. The Motions of the Earth or Sun, (The Lord know's which) that Turn, or Run, Are both performd by fits, and Starts; And so are those of Lovers Hearts: Which though they keep no eaven Pace; Move Tru, and Constant to one Place. As both the Longitude, and Latitude, Are only by each other, understood; And nothing else, but either Parallel What th' other mean's can Naturally tell. The under-Earth Degrees of Heaven show, And only Heavn, those of Earth below. But which move's Round; or which stands always stil, The Learned make a Doubt, and ever will; As much as whether Zealots use to move, From th' Earth with us below, or Heavn, above. So learned men, from Substance without Matter Conclude the Greatest Myracles in Nature, Demonstrate Artificially mere Fancies, And Prove Eaternity b' as Hard Nunc-stances. For if the water constantly grow lesse And th' Earth is found as Naturally t' Increase As virtuosos Naturally believe, By Lands the Sea has beene observd to leave. Besides th' Abundant Quantity, she uses In all mixt compositions, she Produces, Which 'tis unreasonable, and in vaine, T' expect should ever be Returnd againe, With other Instances as Evident, The stock of water, wil in th' end be spent, The ocean-seas perpetually wast Until they are utterly Dryd up at last; And if the Sun do's but draw neare to us As great Philosophers believe He do's, The Date of this worlds Charter will Expire And all its Moveables Consume in Fire. CHYMISTRY A Sottish Chymist in Dispight of Nature Think's to make Gold by Penetrating Matter: And, like a Spirit, Transubstantiate Brass-Pots, and Kettles, into Silver Plate Of which the greater Dose must be allowd, To keep th' Alloy from being understood: And therefore Ignorantly take Occasion, To pass it for as vaine Multiplication. In which th' Appeare as Idle and Absurd In Sottishly Mischanging of a word. For he that has but puzzl'd his Criss-cross-over Is learnd enough to make a Stone-Philosopher Who, when they undertake to Teach the Stone, Make Solemne vows t' impart the Truth to None; Which 'tis no Miracle but they may do, And yet sweare only what's exactly tru. The Ablest of their Spagirists are made, Of Hot-braind Bank-rupts, of some other Trade. For if but one, had got th' Hermetique Stone, All others had for ever been undon. The Meanest had Disdaind t' have Bought, or sold, But turnd their Tin, and Lead, and Irn to Gold. While all Professions else, had only serv'd For want of Necessarys, to be stervd. The Prices of all things had grown so Great That None but Chymists could afford to Eate. And when there were no other Men to Rob Had beene Reducd to th' Indigence of Job; And no men Held more wretchedly undon, Then those who Newly had found the Stone: Beside, if Fire cannot Distroy (as th' hold), By consequence it never can make Gold, For Art and Nature nere found out a way To make that, which it self Cannot Destroy. MAGIQUE The Devill was more Generous then Adam, That never Layd the Fault upon his Madam: But like a Gallant, and Heroique Elfe, Tooke freely all the Crime upon himself. For Men are never certaine of strange sights, Their Senses are so Distressed with Frights: Especiall[y] of Specters, that forbeare, Unless it bee in Darkest Nights, t' appeare. For Magique is a False Spirituall slur, And therefore subtler then the Secular: Is more Mysterious, as it is Infernall, And hard to [be] Disciferd then the Carnall: Whose Intricate Designes, are better Layd, Then those that use to be above boord playd. For Ages, when they are Inhumane Grown, Make worke, for Idle Sorcerers, to own: When all extravagant, and Lewd Capricches, Are Chargd upon the false Accompt of witches. As if th' Indentures between Hags and Fiends Were more Familiar then the Name Pretend's. When some have Hangd for swimming on their Backs And Sticking Pins, in Images of Wax. For Men are counted Atheists that Deny, Or doubt the Devils Infallibility: When Cats for Nine Lives have procurd a Lease, To serve him Co[n]stantly with Pigs and Geese. And witches both their Soules, and Bodys give To Please themselvs with mischief while they live; When nothing can fall out, tho ere so Common, But is Reducd to Prodigy, or Omen. [A Witch] Is Able to outly a Proselyte, That has been New-absolvd b' a Jesuite: And by Confession's orderd to Deny all He had acknowledg'd, when he comes to Tryall. Untill the Poore Deluded Creature Dy's, A Martyr, to the Patriarke of Lys. The Devil first Debaucht a modest Man To bee a Courtier quite against the Graine. And in Defyance of his Fatall Stars Trepand a Timorous Coward to the wars. For when the Devill ow's some Men a Shame, He put's-by all the Passes, that they Aime. And with his Cloven Diabolique Foot Kicks all the mischief down, they go about. There Need's no other Charme, nor Conjurer, To Rayse Infernall Spirits-up, but Feare: That makes Men Pul their Hornes in, like a Snayle That's both a Prisner to it selfe, and Jayle. Draws more Phantastique Shapes, then in the Graines, Of knotted wood; in some Men's Crazy Braines: When all the cocks they think they see, and Bulls, Are only in the Insides of their Sculs. So in the stable ty'd-up Nags Are Ridden Post, by mounted hags. The Prophesies of Dreams Prognosticate Mens Constitutions rather then their Fate. GEOMANCY Geomancy Is nothing but a Trick to fancy, That setting down a few smal Pricks More Short then other Magique tricks, Like throwing Dice upon the Square, P[r]edict at Random unaware, By which no Doubt can be so Hard, But in a moment may be cleard. ASTROLOGY The Antients held no Omen was so Dire, As to Spill water, when they ta[l]kd of Fire. And that the certainst Skemes they had of thieves Portended those that usd to weare Long sleevs: Believd the Stars knew less of our Affairs, And are as unconcernd as we in theirs: Who have no way to know, Believe, or guesse At what they should bee by Appearances. Whether the Fixt Stars are but Holes, to pass Th' Empyrium through, in Bright Effluvia's Or Suns to other worlds; It is No matter To all our own Discoverys in Nature. For he that only look's among the Stars To finde the Dark Events, of Peace or wars, And not among th' Affairs of Active men, Do's ten times, more Ridiculously then Hee that tooke Pills for finding-out his Ass Altho by Accident, it came to Pass. For those are frequentst by the Stars Detected, Whom most of all the wizard findes suspected: Is sure to be his own significator Whose Influence they most of all Look after. Astrology, and Magique, Charms, and Spels Are all that's Left, o' th' Devils Oracles: Have acted greater Diabolique Sorcerys, Then all the Litters of his Lapland-Nurserys. Fooles are Familiars to themselvs, That serve the Cunning men for elvs: And make them only pimp, and set, And owne the Tricks, they Counterfet. That Hire, and Promp them to Detect, The Parties, whom they most suspect: And tell them first what Kinde of Men That they may tell it them agen. The Factorys of Folly, and Imposture, That with the weak, and Ignorant pas Muster: Astrology, and all those Monstrous Fictions, To cheat the world with Counterfet Prædictions: That serve for nothing, if they should be tru, But to take up misfortune, ere 'tis Due. For Comets, and Ecclipses stil foreboad Distruction to Mankind, but never Good: With Chieromancy, Horoscopy, and Caball, The Drums, and Rattles, of the Sottish Rabble With all the vaine, Impertinent Delusion[s] Of Frantique and Fanatique Rosi-crucians All meant for Scarcrows false, and Counterfet, To fright the world out of its little wit: For all their stiff Formalitys of Arts, Are no more Revrend, then the Beards of warts. For did not once Astrologers perswade Th' Inhuman Emprour Nero, to evade The Dire Distruction, which a Star did seem, To aime and Level Purposely at him: To frustrat all the Black Designs of Fate, And turn their sad Effects upon the State? So some that passe for Deepe Astrologers Have made great Princes Presents of New-stars, As Virtuosos sillyly have don And giv'n away whole Ilands in the Moon: Although not fortifyd so Regular, With Natrall Strength, as Castles in the Air. Nor should their Art, or Science Mathematique Escape the Test, which th' Antients took of Magique, That undertake's the Universe to Fathom From Infinite down to a single Atom. And venturs to unriddle evry Cause That Nature uses, by their own By-laws. When all that's truly useful in the Art Is no more then the mere Mechanique Part And if they strive to aime beyond; Their Rules Will not fit Nature and their Gresham-Schooles. For though the Earth be Round, yet evry Span O' th' Superficies Rests upon a Plane, Or else Th' Antipodes could never meet On Equal Tearms, but with their Feet to Feet: And neither Drake, nor Candish, nor Columbus, Had 'ere been able al the Globe to Compas, But evry Pacquet-Boate, or Petty Trader, Had Sunke in th' Aire, and Founderd to Nadyr. So those that made a Planet of the Sun, Were Ignorant of what themselvs had don: When there's so vast a Difference, Betwixt The Rest and him, The world believ's He's Fixt. And all their Notions of a Planet were To be the Thickest Part of all it's Sphere: Can take the Height of Stars, yet do not know Whether they are Above 'em, or Below Or how so many worlds upon their Centers (With all their weight) should [be] hangd up on tenters: Believd the Spheres, were but a Nest of Boxes Only designd for Holding Paradoxes: Whence that of Fire, has been so long Retrencht Of all they had Contrivd it for, and Quencht. Have beat their Braines, about a Freak, and worme, To Square the Circle, they could nere Perform. Things so absurd, Ridiculous, and wild, That now they wil not Pass upon a Child. The Hebrew-Kalendar did never Cast The years Accompt up, till 'twas gone, and Past; Which shew's they gave no Credit to the stars Or those, that Prompted them, Astrologers. LOVE All Lovers in their Amrous fits Turn Poets and set up for wits, Make all their Mistresses of Stars, And, when their Ladys prove averse, Confound and damne the stars for doing Il offices to Cross their woing. For Lover's by their Lady's kindred, The Stars, are often Crost, and hindred. Love is a Boy, and when it's youth Is past, outlive's it self and truth. The Devill has him fast enough Whose stones are in his Cloven hoof. Love that's the work, and Recreation And Charter of the first Creation From whom all Soul's of things derive The Free Inheritance of Life That in a short time would expire But that 'tis lengthned by Desire. —For how Could Nature live But that Love give's it a Reprive, That has no more then one life in't If Love did not inlarge that Stint. All Love at first, like Gen'rous wine, Ferment's, and Frets, until 'tis fine: But when 'tis setled on the Lee, And from th' Impurer matter free: Becomes the Richer stil the older, And Proves the Pleasanter the Colder. As He that steal's away a Heart Has Right to all and evry Part. What woeman ever durst Resist A Diamond Locket at a wrist, Or could Refuse, th' untowardst Lover Imbroderd and Perfumd all over? For though, the less Love Cost's of Pains And Slavry 'tis the Clearer Gaines, As wine (the Friend of Love) Provs Best That Freely Runs, before 'tis Prest; Some Lovers are Besotted most Where most they finde their matters Crost, As other Beasts are Sharper set The lesse they are allowd to eat. Victory in Armes or Love Are Cozin-Germans one Remove. Lov's but an Ague in the old, Whose hot fit come[s] before the Cold. Lovers, like wrestlers, when they do not lay Their Hold below the Girdle, use Fair Play. Love shoots at Random in the Darke, Yet seldom fayles to hit his marke. Can any Powr Pretend to aw Love, Natures Fundamentall Law? Or offer to give Laws t' a Lover, They have no Jurisdiction over? Shall He that with his Magique Bow Strikes Hearts of Monarks through and through Submit his own Great Laws of war, To come t' a Trial at the Bar? To turn Solicitor, and Prog Suborn, Forsweare, and Pettifog? Lovers, that are eternal Haters Of all Impertinent Spectators, And hee's less odious that discovers A Statesman's Cabal, then a Lovers; That do their Busnes best alone And care not to be lookd upon To fight their Duels hand to fist And neede no Seconds to assist. ? As those that shite Abhor to do their Feats in sight. Love like Honor's Priviledgd, And cannot be by oaths obligd, No more then what a witnes swear's, Is valid in his own affaires; And Love has nothing to pretend, But its own Interest and end. Some have been with a look that sour Sharp-set upon a New amoure To set an Edge on Fancy with As Braying of an Ass do's teeth. For what Fond Lover can hold out Till things are fairly brought about? Who shew's he do's not Greatly heed her That can have Patience to consider. [Woman] A most incomparable Creature For want (especially) of a Better. None but Lovers are so absurd To play their false Dice, above Board. When a Surfet of Delight Has Duld the Lovers Appetite, He must have time, til New Desire Restore againe his Amorous Fire. Platonique Love Is from Socratical, but one Remove. Spanish Gallants with their Lances At once wound Bulls and Ladys Fancies; And He subdu's the Noblest Spouse, That widdow's most Tariffa-Cows. Why should not some love Age, and uglines, As wel as stinking meats and rotten cheese? Some time he thinkes there is no trick [O]f Love s' endearing as a kick. Indeed 't were not amiss to venture Men ought to knock before they enter. Love is to[o] great a Happines For this world truly to possess; Could it hold out inviolate Against those Injurys of fate Which all Felicitys below By Cruel Laws are Sentencd to, It would becom a Bliss too high For Perishing Mortality, Translate to earth the Joys above, For nothing go's to heavn, but Love. Love that's by Conversation gaind Must by the same way be maintain'd; Though Absence rayse the Appetite, Like Fasting, it destroy's it quite, When 'tis too long Continu'd. What makes two Buls such mortal Foes To fight to Death, but forty Cows? What Quarrel has a Cock to Cock But right to evry hen in th' Flock? Can Love use so preposterous a Course To take Possession of it's right by force? When Love to Love returnd becomes unkinde Desire is but the Feaver of the minde, That in its hot fit long's to entertaine That which injoyd do's but increase its Paine. Love never feard what Horror might attend In Consequence so it injoyd its end. Passion do's never fall into Distress But when Desire turnes Tenant to excess. O 'tis a Happy and Heavnly Death When a man Dy's above and a woman beneath. Do not mine Affection sligh[t] Cause my Locks with Age are white. Your Brests have snow without and snow wit[hin] While Flames of fire in your bright eies are see[n]. That Heart must be of Horn or tuffer That would not yeald to see you suffer. For though some one way, some another Yet al are Martyrs to Loves mother. Love is so far from b'ing derivd From Likenesses, as 'tis believd, That it may rather seem to bee Th' effect of Contrariety: For all Fair women Love black men, And black men stil Love them agen; Low men Love women that are tall, And they them as Fantastical; The Bewteous for the ugly burne, And they an equal flame return. Expecting Love stands at a Stay But in th' injoyment post's away. A woman's Like a Looking glas That entertains the shape of any face. If Love between a Man and woman Be nothing but Desire of union, No Man would hang himself to fly That which he cannot have, and Dy. Love and Fighting is the Sum Of all Romances from Tom Thumb To Arthur, Gundibert, and Hudibras, And all those worthys that De Scudry has. Doe not unjustly blame My guiltles brest For vent'ring to disclose a Flame It had so long supprest. In its own Ashes it designd For ever to have layn But that my sighs like blasts [of wind] Make it break out again. The lylly grows not, nor the Rose Upon your Chekes, but in my Hose. Love that has substance for its ground Must be more lasting, firm and sound Then that which has the slightest Basis Of Airy Virtu, wit, and Graces. Which is of such thin Subtlety In Man it Creepes in at the eie; But that which its extraction ownes From Solid Gold and pretious Stones, Must like its shining Parents, prove As Solid and as glorious Love. Not ten among a thousand weare Their own Complexions nor their haire. All Ladys what so ere that Dy Are Fair and good in th' Elegie. Tho Love, they say, all Natrall things subdues, The Impotentst the Conqueror Reduce. MARRIAGE Adam, who was but accessary to 's Wife, Was damn'd to dig and drudge for't all his life, While Eve, subornd by the Devil to betray him, Was sentenc'd but to love, and to obey him, Which made her Penance, like her Crime, the worse, Because oblig'd to do it as a Curse, And he at liberty to love, or hate her, Upon her good behaviour, or ill nature, Who is not bound to do it, but at will, Although she use him e're so well, or ill: For there's no Slavery so desperate As to b' impos'd upon to love, or hate. Hence 'tis, they are no sooner made one Flesh, And both compounded int' a civil mesh; But Sexes next become the sole debate, And which has greater right to this, or that; Or whether 'tis Obedience, or Dominion That Man can claim a title to, or Woman, Untill the Issue has been fairly try'd, And legally found oftest for the bride, Who can reduce the most imperious Brave To be her Drudge, and Utensil, and Slave: To Husband takes the Idiot during life And makes him but a Helper to his wife. The Bodys of all Animals Are Femals, and the Souls the Males, That Being Joynd like Man and Wife Maintaine the Intercourse of Life. There's forty Femal witches sent to Jail Condemned and Executed for one Male. A marrid Man com's nearest to the Dead And to be Burryd ['s] but to go to Bed. A Virgin when she works upon a Bed Do's like a Bird but Build a Nest, to Breed. Birds go a wooing in the Spring and wed And none but their own Lawful Spouses tread. A widow do's but Raise up Horns to the dead, As Antient Jews did Issue in their stead. For evry widow is but a Reversion That Brings a Joynter only of her Person. Illegal Matrimony Is but a Pagan Ceremony That in the Team of wedlock yoakes Illegally an As and Ox. A whimsy, in which evry one Believe's he ha's found out the Stone, The only True Receipt to marry, And all beside himself miscarry. One wife did Solomon more Hurt, Then all the Madams of his Court. The Credit of the Marriag-bed Has been so loosly Husbanded, Men only Deal for Ready money, And women Sep'rate Alimoney; And Ladys Errant, for Debauching, Have better Tearmes, and equal Caution: And for their Jorney-worke, and Paines, The Chare-woemen cleare greater Gaines. If he be a Beast that marrys, He's one that Rides, as wel as Carry[s]; As Centaures mount at once, and Beare, And are both Steed, and Cavaliere. A Bargain Clubd to by a Paire Of Dealers at a Chinese Faire, Where hee that want's a wife or money May give or take in matrimony. Virgins Marry just as Nuns; The same thing, the same way Renounce; Before th' have wit to understand The Bold Attempt they take in hand; Or having stayd, and lost their Tides, Are out of Season grown for Brides. And though one wife undid the Devil, That do's not Prove al others evil. One Mistress would have made Belpheger In half the Time as great a Begger. Some say that Lovers marry, As Criminals take Sanctuary, In Prison one another Clap, Until they finde a way t' escape. Agree and cleave to one another Like John Baptista, and his Brother. The Natural Difference Of Temper, Humor, wit, and Sense, And th' endles Cavils they Produce, Make all their Quiet but a Truce. Only with their Bodys worship, For Souls are not Concernd in Courtship. And yet some strive, as if the Curse Were not enough, to make it worse. When Ladys of the Fairst Deserts, For Virtu, Bewty, wit, and Parts, Will Squander al away at once Upon as wonderful Pultrones, And, though Disfigur'd with French Pock-holes Th' had got by Playing at Hotcockles Among so many, none knew who The Lady was that gave the Blow, Yet still th' Inhumaner they Prove Become the Stupider in Love Who all Inheritances owe To th' Tenure of the Marriage-vow. All Sorts of Vot'ries, that profes To binde themselves Apprentices To Heav'n, abjure with solemn vows Not Cut, and Longtail, but a Spouse, As th' worst of all Impediments To hinder their Devout intents. [Kings] By Proxy bring the Love Intregue To Consummation, with one Leg As Jews Contracted with their Hams And marry only with their Names, Espouse a Picture for a Queen And take their Chance unsight unseen. To Love, and Honor, and obey Things, that the Bride may sing, or Say, And when th' are spoken by the Priest Take 'em for th' Husband if she list. Who when th' are virgins and but woo'd Pass all for Gentle, soft, and Good But with their wedding cloath[s] and Rings Degenerat to other things. The Banes of Matrimony To Aloes turne all their Honey. Man brought nothing of his Bliss But woman, out of Paradise, No Relique of his former Life And blest Condition, but his wife [And] as that life, and Innocence Did never Part, before, nor since, All that is left of both, live's now Contracted in the marriage vow That all his earthly loss supplys With everlasting Paradise. For he who rashly interlopes, And ventures upon trading Sloops, Besid the Danger of b'ing fird, And blown up in the Pink he Hird, Makes forfeture of all he beares, And wracks the Title of his Heirs, Of all their Right (but shame) defeats 'em, And strives t' expose, before he gets 'em. No virtu can disparage A modish wit so much as marriage That scorn it as a Paltry vanity That has too little Inhumanit[y]. When unequal youth, and Age, I' th' Banes of Matrimony 'ngage, All other Matters run as Cross, When Expectation's at a Losse, When Feeble Impotent Fruition Determines, in as Idle wishing. And all the Sports of Love and Jumbling Conclude in Miserable Tumbling; In Driblets cannot pay th' Expence Of Dunning Due Benevolence, Until the Doteing Blown-up Lover Makes all he Ha's to Feoffes over, To pay th' Arrieres, with Use on Use, And all from time to time accrew's. When Love is still behind in Payment, And turne's Platonique in th' Injoyment: For Matrimony's a Quietus To Love, though ever so Impetuous. Yoaks are understood But Characters of servitude. In four hundred yeares, one Dozen Of Jews produc'd six hundred thousand. As the Romans drubd mens Bones To th' Cadences and Moods of Tunes, And Rack'd a Guilty Criminal With Fiddle strings through al the Skale, To shew, that Justice in their state Was don in Measure, Time, and weight; Our Ladies, with Inchanting Cords, They set to more bewitching words, Performe the same, and with the Charm Their Hearts as wel as eares Disarm— Those Passionate Croamatique Clamors Melodious as the Ratling Hammers By which Philosophers found out The Alpha-bet, of evry Note And from the Braying Tones of Asses Invented Trebles first, and Bases. Whence Lovers use, in all their Songs, To treat of nothing but their wrongs, Delight in Streames, that, as they Glide, In Purling murmurs vex and Chide. [Ladies] Whose Soules weare nothing of their own But what is Borrowd and put on; That, like their watches, weare their faces In delicate Inammeld Cases, And all their Sense and wit as Tawdry Except their Native Talent: Bawdry. Mean while, more By-blows are begot In Matrimony then without. Nor can Diseases, though begot By one, or Both, unty the knot: For Health and Sicknes b'ing al one Which both ingagd before, to own; And are not with their Bodys bound, To worship only when th' are sound: The worst that fals can be no more Then was provided for before. And when both sides have shard the Hurt, Who ever did it suffer's for't. The Giving of the Brid 's as fatall As Giving Sentence, wounds, or Battle. 'Tis Desperat t' espouse a Fool And not be able to controll. For in the Factory of wives, An Hundred break, for one that thrive's. Andromeda was chain'd t' a Rock On worse Tearms in the Marriage-yoake Then but to be Devour'd by a whale, More Gentle then the Rugged Male. He was a Man that only Marryd With Palisados t' arme his Forehead. For nothing but his easy Head Was of his Issu, brought to Bed, As once the Thundrers Pia Mater Is sayd t' have brought him forth a Daughter. Sick of a fatal Pleurisy, a Bride, The desprat'st inflammation of the side. When Continence and Chastity in Rome Was such a monstrous Prodigy become, Suspected Vestals nothing could relieve Less strange than carry'ing water in a Sieve; Or, with their Girdles from their Wastes unbound, Two mighty Ships that had been run on ground, Which all the Force of Rome in vain before Had strove to disengage and drag a shore. So necessary then were all th' Acquests Of Matrimony to their Interests. For Fortune had no other way so soon To set Men either up, or pull them down: Which all the noblest Romans then were fain T' assert with marks of Honour, and maintain; When greatest Magistrates enjoy'd their Peerage According to their elder dates of Marriage, And married Men of all the rest took place, Who had no Wives to shew for't, in the case; And therefore those that us'd t' adopt their Heirs, And for their Fathers turn'd their Fatherers, Ne're ask'd the real Parents, if th' were got Exactly in the legal Form, or not; Were bound to nothing else, but that the years Both of the new made Parents, and their Heirs Might prove s' agreeable, they might be hop'd To have begot, as well as to adopt. The Dutch (of course) lay Matrimony by Like th' extreme Unction, till they come to dye; And, if they wed within the nick of life, The Issue's lawful, and the Bride the Wife. The antient Jews were bound to do the deed, To raise their nearest Cousin-Germans seed, Who us'd to father, after they were dead, And own the Children gotten in their stead. Birds hatch the Eggs they use to sit upon, No matter whether th' are, or not, their own; And make their Cocks themselves to sit, and brood Upon the young ones, which they never trod. Whence 'tis, that far more Bye-blows are begot In Matrimony, than there are without, As oft as Hedghogs suck the Teats of Cows And Virgin-Pullets have been clap'd by Crows. The antient Greeks, the Oracle profest To be the wisest men of all the rest, Believ'd the Globe of Earth, the Fire and Water To be the greatest Deities in Nature, And those more holy and devout than the others, That marri'd with their Daughters, and Mothers. For Matrimony's but a bargain made To serve the Turns of Interest and Trade; Not out of Love or kindness, but designs, To settle Lands and Tenements like Fines; Where Husbands are but Copy-holds, and Wives Mere Messuages to have and t' hold for lives. Marriage either make's or mars More Certain then Ascendant stars. An Error that b'ing once Committed By death alone can be acquitted. That Bind's the Bridegroom, and the Bride, I' th' middle like a Fagot ty'd. A thing that's only usd for Forme Which none that undertake Perform. No more Concernd then Vouchers are In what they undertake to Sweare. A Happines that only Lyes Amonge the Sottish or the wise That oversee, or else Prevent Th' occasions of their Discontent. WOMEN A Parsons wife, some Critiques use to Recon Half-way in Orders, like a Fœmall Deacon That by their Husbands Copys, are ordaind, And made their Vicars, at the Second Hand; And by their Spirituall Callings, have their Shares In ordering the Parishes Affairs. And chang the Nature of their Sex, betwixt The Clergy, and the Layety Commixt. The one half of the world has been begot Against the other Parts Designe and Plot. The Soules of women are so small That Some believe th' have none at all; Or, if they have, Like Cripples, still Th' ave but one Facu[l]ty, the Will; The other two are quite layd by To make up one great Tyranny: And though their Passions have most Powr, They are (like Turkes) but slaves the more To th' Abs'lute will, that with a breath Has Sovrain Powr of life and Death. And, as it's little Intrests move, Can turne 'em all to Hate or love, For nothing in a Moment turn To Frantique Love, Disdain, and Scorn, And make that Love degenerate T' as great extremity of Hate And Hate againe, and Scorn, and Piques To Flames, and Raptures, and Love-tricks. Our women, though they have forsworn Virginity, like Nuns, are shorn. The chast Lucrecia durst not stand The fatal thrust of Tarquins hand, But rather let him have his will Then feel the sharpnes of his steel; But when the Feat was don and past All remedy (I mary was't) She did not feare to act his part, And boldly stabd her self to th' heart. The Sophy give's his Bauds Commission To Leavy, for his own Provision The Brightest Bewtys, and to Choose Those that are fittest for his use, With Powr, by Privy-search, to try Their fitnes, and Ability, If they Rest quietly t' explore Or in their sleeps break winde, or snore. LUST Compard with you, the Antique Dame Had never gaind her self, a Name, By Breaking of the wildest Horses Who do it better with their ?. What's Pleasure but the Repetition Of over-ridden, Tyrd Fruition? Harlotry's a Double vice As Cissors Cutting once Cut twice. There are more Naked, Baudy Pictures made Of Innocent Lucrecia with her Blade, Then all the Famous Lady Curtezans; In History, or fabulous Romances. Monsters got twixt Man and Beast Stil take to th' Human-Parent least Because the Beast, that do's but suffe[r], Is not so Beastly as the Lover. As Frenchmen with their Diseases As Fraile, and tender as Punaises. A Leacher's like a Bartl[m]ew fair Fiddle With nothing but a lazzo in the middle. One under Milstone, wil weare out, Six upper-ones that Turn about. And if she chance t' imploy a Neibor To save herself and him the Labour The Busnes is the better don Then if sh' had trusted him alone. What Lovers e're were so Capriccious To whip their own Socratique Breeches? Claps that in the Getting Please Delight as much in giving ease. Punks made their Easy Cullys truckle As witches Ride the Imps they suckle. More Arts are usd to bring in a ? whore Then to Create a French Pope heretofore. The Turks Seragl[i]o Is but a kind of Bawdy Hospital, Where Eunuch-Pimps and Virtuoso-women Are kept with smal Allowances in Common, Shut up and watchd in Secret Nunnerys Beyond the Reaches of the Publique Eies, And not allowd at Liberty to Ramble And clap the Sex with scandalous Example. [Courtiers] With costly Pride, and vanity, Proclame Their Infamous Prerogative of Shame, And by their Pompe, and Insolence, and Port, The Ignorance and weaknes of the Court, Until the very Name of Chr[i]stian Is but a Foyl to that of Musselman. The Antients in their times esteemd it more, Then Punishment enough, To be a whore. That Draw their faces after the Designe Of th' Antient Master, Peter Aretine, And for the Strokes and Cullor of the Paint, 'tis All coppyd out of famous Elephantis. HONOR Dishonor, tho a Negative, is Real But Honor Nothing but a Jugler['s] Spell. Has no more virtue in't, nor Influence Then th' Antient Powder, of Experience: That Smoke, the vaprous Excrement of Fire, Do's not more Naturally strive, t' aspire. That aime's at no Designe, but to exempt The Mean, and Despicable, from Contempt: And when they have no Honor of their owne To take a Dispensation of the Crown. A Priviledg of Pereage, and Free Grant, T' indulge the frayl Nobles with what they want; A Royall Bill of Store, and many times A Pardon for th' Intollerablest Crimes Which make's the New-Atchievments pass, instead Of Honorable, Heroique Act, and Deed. And servs for Compensation to Supply The Reall wants of tru Nobility. For those that only Clame the Priviledge To Ride to execution, on a Sledge Disdaine Inferiors, of less Deserts That only are allowd to Ride in Carts. The Turks caress a Drunken Prisoner And Drub them, till they greater men Appeare Then they would owne themselves, t' have been before, To set a greater Ransom on their score. And Painters made all Signes o' th' Saracen As big as Gyants, tho but Little men; Because the Christians in the holy wars Were sometimes beat by such smal Conquerors, To save their Credit, Drew their Heads and Faces As fierce as Gog-magogs, or Goliasses. Contempt of Honor in the Great is worse Then want of Conscience, in Inferiors. And when there are two Persons, that within The Species only, hardly are of kin, A great and lesser, both lay Claims t' allyance, With æqual Scorn of both sides, and Defyance: For Little Familys, are sure to claime, To be the Best Descended of the Name: And Antient Houses, that are under Hatches Have been Restord to Honorable by matches; And New ones half-gentile, Half-Mungrels, Have been erected into Great, from Dung-hills. How many Kitchin-mayds, and homely Drudges Have been espousd by Aldermen, and Judges? And Whetstone-Sinners, virtuous Ladys dubd As soon as Churchd of Child-bed-Claps, and tubd. The Raggedst Begger is the most Clinquant, And He the Richest that is most in want. For those that have the Plentifullest Stores, Of Broken Limbes, and Vermin, Scabs and Sores And own the Greatst Variety of Patches Are held the most Considerable Matches. So thievs abroad are held the most Gentile That oftest stand for Breaking on the wheel Have don their Exercises best to Boyl, For Forging Coyn, in Kitchen-stuf, or Oyl, On Gibbets strivd to take their last Farewels And Hang themselvs for their own Passing-bels; Have undergone the French Strapado oftest Down from the Top to Bottom and the loftiest. All wild, but Generous Creatures, Live of Course As if they had Agreed for better, or worse: The Lion's constant to his only Miss And never Leav's his Faithfull Lioness. And she as Chast and tru, to him, agen As virtuous Ladys use to be to Men. The Docile and Ingenious Elephant, T' his own, and only fœmal, is Gallant: And she as Tru, and Constant, to his Bed: That first Injoyd her single Mayden-Head. But Paltry Rams, and Bulles, and Goats, and Boars Are never satisfyd with New Amores, As all Pultrons with us delight to Range, And tho but for the worst of all, to change. THE WORLD Divide the world int' equall Halfes The one's all Fooles, the other Knaves. All Ovids Metamorphoses Turn Men to Beasts, or Stones, or Trees But seldom any where translate The Changlings to a Better State. Should [once] the world Resolve t' abolish All that's Ridiculous, and Foolish, It would have nothing left to do T' apply in Jeast or Earnest to, No Busnes of Importance, Play, Or State, to pass it's time away. Mankind's the same to Beasts and Fouls That Devils are to Humane Soules, Who therefor, when like Fiends th' appeare, Avoyd and Fly with equal feare; And to be tempted or to be tam'd Is but to be betrayd or Damnd; While Both have but one Reason for't, Their own Advantages or Sport. The world, the more it know's, The worse and wickeder it grows. Is but more vaine, and Foolisher The more it turns Philosopher: For Truth, and Reason are not fit For all mens Tempers, nor their wit, And knowledge honestly acquird More hard to come by, then th' Inspird Where Men may 'ssume with greater ease Then Pains, and Study, what they please; And, as they Grow more Rich by stealing By Cheats, and Fraud then honest Dealing, Appeare more wise by shifts and Tricks Then Just, and solid Politiques And sooner wriggle into Trust Then think to rise by being Just. When al the world for Sin was drownd, That which succeeded was not found To be much better, then Before, But to deserve that vengeance more. The Greatest People and the least Are much the same, like East and West, For Luxury the one, as much as The other Penury, Deboches. What Horrid Actions would the world forbear If Men were sure to be Immortal here? When those that do but think, they may be so, Such Barbrous Villanys Presume to do. For Innocence is a Defence For nothing else but Conscience; 'Twil not beare out the blows of Fate, Nor Fence against the Tricks of State; Nor from th' oppression of the Laws Defend the Plain'st and Justest Cause; Nor keep unspotted a good Name Against the obloquies of fame; Feeble as Patience, and as soon By being blown upon undon. If a few sober thoughts might be allowd Free from the Sottish Madnes of the Crowd; Or that it were not madnes now to dare But to be less mad then our betters are, I would say something faine, but truth and Sense Are now become a high and bold offence, And knowledg such forbidden fruite, [he] shows A desprat Folly, that Speake's what he knows. For men are grown so bad, they can indure The ? Disease no longer, nor the Cure, But rave like madmen in their hottest fits 'Gainst those that strive to bring them to their wits. Never for Satyr was there better times, Wee now are got up to the hight of Crimes: All that was don before was mean and low To that, which evry Day produce's now. When Death Come's to the happy and the blest They'r turnd out; and the wretched but releast. For to what end do's wit and Learning serve But to bring those, that own them most, to s[t]erve? There's nothing great, or high, or Noble, That is not ful of glorious trouble. Disclame the mean Applause of Ignorants Live with thy self and thou wilt know thy wants. As no excess can hold without supply, Rapine is Treasurer to Luxury. Think evry Day thy last and what remain[s] Comes unexpectedly and is cleare gaines. This world is like Noahs Ark In which few men but many Beasts imbark. Vices, like eeles, slip through a gentle hand, But with rough Leaves are held, or rugged Sand. A Pimp Is but a whores familiar or her Imp. The world would be more Just, if truth, and Lys And Right, and wrong, did beare an æqual Price; But since Impostures are so highly Raysd, And Fayth, and Justice equally Debasd, Few men have Tempers, for such Paltry Gaines, T' undo themselves, with Drudgery, and Paines. A Place so barbarous and foul The Devil would [not] go there for a Soul, And, if h' had left his eies behind, Rather then fetch 'em would be blinde. Our solemn Blacks are worn To cloath our selves not them for whom we [mourn]. Shame and Repentance are the Constant Price Of all our False and Idle vanities, And our best wisdom only to esteeme The world a vain and Short Fantastique Dreame. For most mens Lives are nothing but Diversions T' avoyd th' uneasinesses of their own Person's. Had rather tumble Sisiphus his Stone Then but indure themselvs, to be alone. Man of all Creatures the most Fierce and wild That ever God Made, or the Devil Spoyld. For Mankind Naturally resents the Need Of nothing more then what they are forbid. There is no honest meanes of Rising high: The Stairs of Rooms of State are built awry. So wax, that is the worst of all things else, Is therefore usd to serve the world in Seales, When nothing in the world can be more fit To be Defacd, and Forgd, and Counterfit. Dead mens Graves Consume and Bury their own Epitaph[s]. Life is a Game that'[s] lost before 'tis Playd And is but not thrown up, when 'tis Injoyd. VULGARITY How various, and Innumerable Are those, who live upon the Rabble? 'Tis they maintaine the Church, and State, Imploy the Priest and Magistrate, Beare all the Charge of Government, And pay the Publique Fines, and Rent; Defray all Taxes, and excises, And Impositions of all Prices; Beare all th' expence of Peace, and war, And pay the Pulpit, and the Bar: Maintain all Churches, and Religions, And give their Pastors exhibitions. And those, who have the greatest Flocks, Are Primitive, and orthodox. Support all Schismatiques, and Sects, And pay 'em for tormenting Texts. Take all their Doctrines of[f] their Hands And pay 'em in good Rents, and Lands; Discharg all Costly Offices, The Doctor's and the Lawyers fees, The Hangmans wages, and the Scores Of Caterpiller Baudes, and whores; Discharge all Damages, and Costs Of Knights, and Squires of the Posts, All Statesmen, Cutpurses, and Padders, And pay for all their Ropes and Ladders; All Pettifoggers, and all Sorts Of Mercats, Churches, and of Courts; All Sums of Money payd or spent, With all the charges Incident, Layd out, or thrown away, or given, To purchace this world, Hell, or Heaven. For should the world but take account To what it's Charges do amount, One third at least of all the Sum Is spent upon the world to Come. Nothing make's Hell s' intollerable As the bad Company and Rabble. All Mankind is but a Rabble As silly and unreasonable As those that Crowding in the Street To see a Show or Monster meet; Of whom no one is in the Right, Yet all fall out about the Sight; And when they chance t' agree, the choyce is Still in the most and worst of Voyces; And all the Reasons that prevayle Are measur'd not by weight but tale. Non live so happy and at ease As those who mortifying profes. The two wicked Elders Susanna would grope While she sent out her mayd to fetch her some sope; But when they could not make her a whore They swore she had swiv'd with another before. A Thief, whose Destiny's forespoke, And sentenc'd by his hanging Look, As soon as he's condemn'd to dye, Looks handsome in the Rabble's eye. MORALITY All mens Intrigues, and Projects tend By sevrall Courses to one end, To Compass by the Properst shows, What ever their Designes propose; And that which ownes the fairst Pretext 'Tis often found the Indirect'st. Hence 'tis that Hypocrites stil paint Much fayrer then the Real Saint, And Knaves appeare more just, and true Then honest men, that make less show; The Dullest Ideots in Disguise Appeare more knowing then the wise; Illiterate Dunces undiscern'd Pass in the Rabble for the Learnd; And Cowards that can damn, and Rant Pass muster for the Valiant. For he that has but Impudence To all things has a Just Pretence; And Put amonge his wants but shame To all the world may lay his Clame. In Ballances the lightest end Do's always Naturally ascend: So in th' Affaires of Church and State Men soonest rise for want of weight: And as those Names are Counted best, That signify and meane the least; So 'tis with Persons in th' opinion Of Church and State, that have least in 'em. Al great Men are found to rise As Pigeons mount with seald-up eies. For as in great and Crowded Faires Monsters and Puppet plays are wares, Which in the less wil not go of[f], Because they have not money enough: So men in Princes Courts will pass, That will not in another place. Most of all great Persons Fates Deserve mens Pitty or their Hates. Men flatter with their Tongues, more false, And base, then Dogs do, with their Tayles, And creep more vilely into favour, Then Hounds that drivel, with their Chaps, and slaver. To aske Forgivenes, and excuse An Injury, and past Abuse Is such a Plaister for a wound As that o' th' weapon Salve is found, That only has virtue to restore And Cure the Hurt it did before. Willows are weak and yet beinge Bow'd Have Powr to binde the stubborn'st wood. Mens Armes grow next their heads t' infer Advice and Action should be neare. As Thistles wear the softest Down, To hide their Prickles, till they're grown; And then declare themselves, and tear Whatever ventures to come near: So a smooth Knave does greater Feats Than one, that idly rails and threats, And all the Mischief, that he meant Does like a Rattle-snake prevent. As al men Live by one anothers Deaths The Murthrer gaine's but what the Dead bequeaths. AVARICE As he, whose destiny do's prove To dangle in the Aire above, Do's loose his life for want of Air, That only fell to be his share: So he, whom Fate at once design'd To Plenty and a wretched minde, Is but condemnd to rich Distress, And starves with Niggardly excesse. So Ships that chance to run aground Are oft for want of water drown'd. [A Miser] Who with an upright Heart Lov'd Gold, Not to injoy but t' have, and hold, And was it's tru, and Real Friend Without the least Designe, or end. Observd it only for it self As hidden Treasure's by an Elfe. In all the world, there is no vice Less Prone t' excess then Avarice; It neither cares for food, nor clothing: Nature's Content with little, that with nothing. FORTUNE [DAME] Fortune some Men's Tutelar Takes charge of them without their Care, Do's all their Drudgery, and work, Like Fairies, for 'em in the Dark, Conduct's 'em Blindfold, and advances The Naturals by blinder Chances: While others by Desert and wit, Could never make the Busnes hit, But still the Better they Deserve, Are but the Abler thought to sterve. Fortun[e]'s never so Perverse As when Sh' oblige's Conquerers. For Victorys acquird too soon Are Lost as Easyly as won. Men at their Hight of Fortune are undon As all Ecclipses Happen at Ful moon. There is no more, but a mere cast at Dice Between the Greatest Idiot, and the wise But Cross, and Pile between the Great, and Smal And which shal Prove the Female, or the Male. For some Mens Fortunes like a weft or Stray Are only Gaind by loosing of their way An[d] fall from one mans, to anothers Hands By chance and Destiny like Deodands. The Cunningst Gamsters are not lik[e] to win That Put out Better Cards then they take in. Man is supreme Lord and Master Of his own Ruin and Disaster, Controuls his Fate, but nothing else In ord'ring his own Happiness: For all his Care and Providence Is too too feeble a Defence, To render it secure and certain Against the Injuries of Fortune; And oft, in spight of all his Wit, Is lost with one unlucky hit, And ruin'd with a circumstance, And mere punctilio of Chance. As Gold, that's proof against th' Assay, Upon the Touchstone wears away; And, having stood the greater Test, Is overmaster'd by the least: So some Men, having stood the Hate And spiteful Cruelty of Fate, Transported with a false Caress Of unacquainted Happiness, Lost to Humanity and Sense, Have fall'n as low as Insolence. WEALTH The fishes of the Sea have more And Richer Banks of wealth in Store With Pretious Stones of greater worth Then all the Princes of the Earth Brought freely in by evry Storme But do 'em neither good nor Harme; Which, if they were on Land, th' excess Would bring their valew down to less And render them as useless here As now th' are to no purpose there; So Dutch men to Keep up the Price Are fain to burn vast Stores of Spice. Partners in Distress agree Much better then Prosperity. The Restles Drudgery of Fooles That for their work mistake their Tooles And, like the silly Prussian, eate, And swallow Knives instead of meate, And know no use at all for Money But Slavery and Parcimony. [Fooles] That have no use, beside their Drudging, For all their Miserable Curmudging, But, for an Itch of getting more, Will venture all they had before, And for an Idle Flam of Hopes Stake Necks and all to th' ods of Ropes. The very Paint of Gold is Poyson And Gold to some have provd as Noysom. An Old Curmudgin Grown Rich with Penury, and Drudging, As Usurers Tooles work night and Day And earne by Passing time away, The more his Time is idly Lost And thrown away, improv's it most Let's out his Heralds fields of Gold For Mortgages, to have and hold Until h' has Raysd his Silver-Acres Beyond th' Unconscionablest Rackers. Men are not Limited with less, or more: Desire and Fancy makes them Rich or Poore. WRITERS As 'tis the greatest Mastry in the Art Of Painting, to Foreshorten any Part Then draw it out, So 'tis in Bookes, the Chief Of all Perfections, to be Plain, and Brief. For He that Plainly writs his Busenes down, He is obligd to Justify and owne, Appeares more wise, then if he did Compile Far Greater Matters in a Polishd Style. It is impossible to write Satyrically, and not light On something of him unawares As Spaniels Casually Start Hares. The Modern times have no Arithmetique Of th' Antient Roman Masters, nor the Greek. The Antients Seldom did translate a Book, But only what was for their Purpose tooke, And left the Rest for others to make use Of what they Pleasd, and freely Pick and Choose. But what is more Familiar in their Books Then Men begetting children upon Brooks? From which they fetch their Antique Pedigrees And own themselves at first a Spawne of Fish. Others derive their Races from the Gods That Ravisht silly Virgins in the woods, As Naturally as the Spanish Kinde Of Running Nags ingendred by the wind. As Cutpurses do never minde what Sum Nor who the Person is, they take it from, And, though their Throttles are layd down at Stake, Know nothing if they Gold or Silver take, Some strive the Cheapest ways to understand And take their Notions up at second Hand. All Plagiarys do but Steal, and Poch And upon other Careless wits encroach. Converst with wits, and Rallyers, to way lay And Intercept, all that they Chancd to say. Made Topiques, Indexes, and Concordances, Of smart Reflexions, Repartees, and Fancies, When that which may be tru enough, turn's False When 'tis but weyd in false uneven Scales. As He that both condemnd and stole from Hobs Like a French Thief that murthers when he Robs. For evry Author is a Criminall, That by his Pere's is Bound to stand, or Fall; And like the Laws Mediety o' th' Tongue By Fooles, or wise men, Censurd Right or wrong; Altho in one Epistle Dedicatory, He Pawnes the Notes, He gatherd under Glory; And lays out all the Inventory of Prayses, H' had Scrapd together, in his Comon-Places: To settle all the Property upon Some Honorable, Singular Patrone, Provided the Mecænas undertook Against the Critiques, to secure his Book: And, like a Man of Honor, kept his Promise, To Rescue him from Zoilus, and Momus, That when his Felonys, should be Detected, They might by him, as vainly, be Protected; When all the Powr he has, will not afford A Dispensation, to one Faulty word; A Lewd, and most Ridiculous Divice, And yet by Custome Past for Learnd, and wise. Next this the Præface Follows, with excuses For all the Faults, the Author knows, but uses. Makes his Submission to the Grave, and wise, But the Ignorant, and Criticall De[f]y's: Put's in his own Exceptions before Hand, 'Gainst all that shall Prætend to understand. And like a Guilty Criminall in Books Excepts against his Jury by their Looks Only to Put in Caveats, and Demurrers And Cuningly Assignes himself his Errors; Calls all his Gentle Readers, Thou, and thee: But styles himself, Our Person, us, and wee. Makes Honorable Mention, of all others Who've undergone the Dignity of Authors, And never Names them, but for Honors sake, Especially, of those that seeme to take And have the Naturallest Inclynations To all his own Opinions, and Perswasions. But as the Devill blows both Hot, and Cold So if it be His Chance to Rayle, or Scold H' has foul words enough, for th' extirpation Of all Good maners, in the Civillst Nation. With Tropes, and Figures such as Western-Pugs, Repeate upon the Thames in Dialogues. Until the Porch grow's Bigger then the House: As Mountaines Swel and Ly-in of a Mouse. The Smartest of all Libels and Lampoones Like vermin Scratch, and Bite, but break no Bones; For all their Edges and their Claws are turnd, As soon as once they are Dispisd, and Scornd. For some are stil most constantly Imployd In doing what they study to avoyd: For to consider's nothing but to Prune All that's superfluous, and over don, And not impertinently to ad more To what was too extravagant before; And, therefore, a Judicious Authors Blots Are more Ingenious then his first Free thoughts, And those that understand, are modester In telling truth, then Pedants, when they erre; Are most severe themselvs to all they write, As Candles tremble when they give us light. POETRY As wine, that with its own weight run's, is best, And counted much more noble then the Prest: So is that Poetry, whose generous Straines Flow without servile Study, Art, or Paines. [Poets] Make the Gods Stickle in Heroique Actions, And manage all Disputes in Armes by Factions, That set the Knights together by the eares, And part them afterwards like Dogs and Beares; For when the Champions valiantly have fought The Gods themselves, to part the Fray, fall out. Things that are written in Cold bloud Seldom prove excellently good. Can any thing be don or sayd That may not good, or bad be made? Poets are Free of evry Nation And need no Naturalization. For why should not affected Negligence Pass for wit here as freely as in France? Wits that are always in the State of war Hold it no Crime but Lawful Prize To plunder those that are their enemies. For one Admirer is enough To serve for good sufficient proof, Though ever so extravagant Among the weake and Ignorant. Why should a Man aske Pardon for a fault That's in his Power to commit or not? For as some Critiques use to make that wit, That never was so much as meant for it; [So] (to be like themselves) they'l make that pass For Nonsense and mistake, that never was; [Th]at like to Rookes bet on some fancyd hand, [W]hich they like better then they understand. [F]or what they finde not faulty they wil make, And Damne what's written wel, and they mistake; [F]or whatsoever is above their reach [To] their own Low capacity they'l stretch. It is not Poetry that makes men Poore; For few do write, that were not so before; For those that have writ best, had they been rich, [Had] nere been clap'd with a Poetique itch; Had lovd their ease too well, to take the Paines [To u]ndergo that drudgery of Braines; [B]ut being for all other Trades unfit, [On]ly t' avoyd b'ing idle set up wit. Some call it Fury, some a Muse, That, as Possessing Devils use, Haunts, and forsake's a man, by fits: And when hee's in, h' is out of 's wits. A Foolish Title, like a Foolish Look, Is a True Symptom of a foolish Book. He that creepes after Sense shal nere excel In Nonsense, Fustian, nor in Doggerel. No other Nation's so severely bent To see offenders brought to punishment As th' English are, for when a Thief is Caught, To be by officers to Justice brought, All People Crow'd to hurry him along, As if h' had don to evry one the wrong: So when a Poet happens to Commit Ever so smal a Robbery of wit, You al Cry upon him, and pursue, As if h' had stol'n from evry one of you. A Satyr, like a Roman Magistrate, Has Rods before him born in state, To fright the Guilty from their Crimes, And Scourge the faults of vicious Times: For in extent of Powr a Satyr Is absolute as a Dictator. Who always shootes his Bolts of wit Has ill Luck if they never hit. Nothing more moves the just disdain of men Then bold assumings of an Ignorant Pen. He that would understand what you have writ Must read it through a Microscop of wit; For evry Line is Drawn so curious there He must have more then eies that reads it cleare. All Elegies are false and Satyrs true If Prayse and Disprayse had its Due. As Pedants when they fayl in prose or verse Maintaine their Errors by committing worse Tel what they learnt when they were boys at Schoole An[d] Justify their Nonsense with a Rule. All writers, though of Diffrent Fancies, Do make all People in Romances, That are distrest and discontent, Make Songs and sing t' an Instrument; And Poets by their Suffrings grow, As if there were no more to do, To make a Poet excellent, But only want and discontent. They, that do write in Authors Prayses, And freely give their Friends their voyces, Are not Confind to what is True; That's not to give, but pay a Due: For prayse that's true, do[es] give no more To worth, then what it had before; But to commend without Desert Requires a Mastery of Art, That set's a gloss on what's amisse, And writes what should be, not what is. In Forraine Universities, When a King's born, or wed's, or Dy's, All other Studys are layd by, And all apply to Poetry: Some write in Hebrew, some in Greeke, And some more wise in Arabique, T' avoyd the Critique, and th' expence Of Difficulter wit, and Sense, And seeme more Learnedish then those That at a greater Charge Compose. The Doctors lead, and Students follow; Some call him Mars, and some Apollo, Some Jupiter, and give him th' ods Or even tearmes of all the gods: Then Cæsar he's nicknamd, as Duly as He that in Rome was Christend Julius, And was adrest to by a Crow As pertinently long agoe; And with more Hero's Names is Stild, Then Saints are clubd t' an Austrian Child: And as wit goes by Colleges, As wel as Standing and Degrees, He stil write's better then the rest, Who's of the House that's Counted best. All the wit At Play-houses is in the Pit. For Poets sing, and ne're speake Plain, As those that quote their works maintain, And no man's bound to any thing He do's not say, but only sing. For since the good Confessors time No deeds are valid writ in Rhime, Nor any held Authentique Acts Seald with a Tooth upon the wax: For Men did then so freely deal, Their words were deeds, and teeth a Seal; And 'tis not a Straw-matter whether 'Tis tru or false, or both, or neither, For all men write in th' Intervalls Of Sense is neither tru nor false. Melodious as the Bard, whose Muse Resound's in Galleries, and Pews, Or those Heroique Deathles sheets Are Chanted at the Ends of Streets. Stages are but Poets Banks On which they play Heroique Pranks. So Homer in th' Immortall Piques Between the Trojans, and the Greeks, That neither Party might Prevayl Bring's in the Gods to stave, and Tayl. For all Encomions are but meant to whedle Enchant and tickle writers, like a Fiddle, And Blow them up, with Rosen, and Horse-hair, As Bel once, and the Idol Dragon were. Some modern Authors have found out New ways To hedg applause in at the end of Plays, And cheat their Audience with a sly intrigue By turning of an Epilogue t' a Jigge, And, if yee clap it, as ye are always wont, To put th' Applause upon the Plays account. But he that makes a Conscience of his ways Wil not defraud you of one Jot of prays, But rather take whatever you think fit Then use the least cheat to set of[f] his wit. Brambles and Thorns weare Prickles to defend Their Harsh wild Fruite against the Fingers end While nobler Trees freely expose their Store And as that's richer, bend their Bows the lower. As Poets that for money write Do but make Sale-work Coarse and slight That for the cheapnes of the Stuff Is like to go the better of[f]. As al Fanatiques preach, so al men write Out of the Strength of Gifts, and Inward light, In Spight of Art, as Horses thorough-pac'd Were never taught, and therefore go more fast. As He that make's his Mark is understood To write his Name, and 'tis in Law as good: So he that cannot write one word of Sense Believ's he ha's as legal a Pretence To Scribble what he do's not understand, As Idiots have a Title to their Land. Some to that height of Impudence are grown To charge on others thefts that are their own. A Prologue is the usher of a Play Just as an Eave is to a Holiday. Critiques are like a kinde of Flys that breed In wild Fig-trees, and when they'r grown up, feed Upon the raw Fruit of the nobler kinde, And by their nibling on the outward rinde Open the Pores, and make way for the Sun To rip'n it sooner then he would have don. Some by whole Tribes and Familys do write New Plays as th' antient Jews were wont to fight. Al men of Judgment do not ask how soone A thing was doing but how wel 'tis done. Some hold it is Impossible to write One Act without a Song, or Dance, or fight, Or make al Different Intrigues accord Until th' have been decided by the Sword. For Gentlest Spectators at a Play, That throng and Crowd to see it the first Day, Feare nothing more then that it should prove Good Or by the wit-inquisitors be allowd, But chiefly those that have writ il before And do intend to try again once more. Who like those kinde Spectators in the Ring When Necks are broken at a Wrastling No matter whose, set up their throats and Bawl O'rejoyd when any man receive's a Fall. Al sorts of Ideots, like Fanatiques, Have pow'r in Comedy, and turn Dramatiques For just as when a Taylor make's a Suite What neede's the Cloth or stuffe he uses to't Should by himself be made? No more is't fit All a man writes should be of his own wit. For He that steales French wit do's worse Then he that Picks an empty Purse, And is an Ignoranter Toney Then he that files and clip's false money, And vainly think's to gaine by those, Who never had one Souse to loose, Worse then a Goldfinder that rake's For Spoones and Bodkins in a Jakes. No Man wants wit, for he that has the least Believes hee's as well furnishd as the Best. For hee's a Poet that write's bad, No less then he that do's excel, As he's a Merchant that do's loose as wel As he that thrives and grow's rich by his trade. As if the Plaine Expression of a Thought, The greatest Mastry, were the greatest fault. For as in Tale of Dead things men are wont To allow more in th' hundred on account Then to the Living: So men after fate, Have more allowd in th' hundred to their weight Then th' had before: For Nature has Contrived, That men are Fuller dead, then when they livd. GOVERNMENT The People have as much a Negative voyce, To hinder making War, without their Choyce, As Kings of Making Laws in Parlament, No Money is as Good as no Assent. For Cromwel found his Politiques Miscarry, By trusting but one Antient Adversary: For all his Arbitrary Empire sunk, As soon as He Employd, and trusted Munke. When Princes idly Lead about, Those of their Party follow Suite, Til others trump upon their Play, And turn the Cards another way. The Greatest Princes are not free from Paying The Cost and Charges of their own betraying, That (like Good Christians) stand faire To take another Cuff on th' Eare, As Jewish Prophets usd t' intreat And beg the Favour to be Beat. Queen Elzabeth Placd Officers to waite In London constantly at every Gate, To Cut the Ruffs of al that Past the Guard That were above a Naile deep of a yard. A womans Government is braver then, And far more Masculine then that of men: The Reason of the Paradox is Common; For woemen take to Men, and men to women. What makes all Subjects discontent Against a Princes Government? And Princes take as great offence At Subjects Disobedience? That neither, th' other can abide, But too much reason on each side? The Roman Empire raysd upon Revenge, for wrongs to Lucrece don, Was after by a Harlot savd From b'ing eternally inslavd; Yet 'tis not wise t' infer from thence All States are safe that use that meanes. For what Do's Hist'ry use to tel us But Tales of Subjects being Rebellious, The vain Perfidiousnes of Lords, And Fatall Breach of Princes words? The Sottish Pride, and Insolence Of Statesmen, and their want of Sense? Their Treachery, that undo's, of Custome, Their own-selves first, next those who trust 'em? Our Saxon Princes spent their Reignes In Building Abbies, Routing Danes That puld them down, and making Saints To fill 'em with Inhabitants. Our Saxon Princes beat the Danes From Pagans into Christians, Who in Requital gave no Quarters, But drubd the Christians into Martyrs. David, who was himself a mighty Prince, Diswade's the world to trust 'em for three Pins. The most Inhumane of the Roman Emprors Were Pædants, and Lief-hebbers in their Tempers; And those that Prov'd the most Infernal Monsters Began with Turning Fidlers first, and Songsters; Were but a kind of Dabling Virtuosos No better then Gitar-men, and Flut-douces; And those that Prov'd the Jockys, of the Cæsars, Forgot the Glory of their Predecessors. The Populace Is Head of all Republicas. [The Rabble] Injoy two equal Delights In Gallowses, and walking Sprights; And visit once a Month of Course The Tombe-stones of their Ancestors. The earth is easier undermind By Moles, and Vermine deaf and Blind Then those that have their senses Sound But cannot Dig so under ground. As those that are starke Blinde, can trace The Nearest ways from Place, to Place: And find the Right way easier out, Then those, that Hoodwink'd try to do't: So Tricks of State are Managd best, By those that are suspected least; And greatest Finenes brought about By Engines most unlike to do't. Tho world believes no Man the worse, That takes the Trecherousest Course: But like's his Jugling as a Cheat feat That's wittily perform'd, and neat: And what they cannot justly gaine, Believe's they ought by Art [t'] obtain. Some Tyrannys have been s' extreame To make it Criminal to dreame When Men for sleeping were condemnd For having traytorously dreamd. A Good Prince is a wonder that appeare's But once or twice in many hundred yeares. All Churches are but th' Interests Of Princes, and the Trades of Priests. No Crisis is so Desperate As Fatal Lethargies of State. For Remedys are spent in vaine, On those who have no sense of Paine. Lyons are Kings of Beasts, and yet their Power Is not to Rule and govern, but Devoure: Such savage Kings all Tyrant[s] are, and they No better then mere Beasts, that do obey. The old Burgundians cald their kings T' accompt for cold and Backward Springs And Punishd them if aught but wel Their Cattle or their Corn befell. Plato held what so ere incumbers Or strengthens Empire comes from numbers. Though once one Conquerd by Delay There were no more that tryd that way. As at th' Approach of Winter, all The Leave's of great Trees use to fall And leave them Naked to ingage With Stormes and Tempests when they rage; While Humbler Plants are found to weare Their Fresh green Liverys all the yeare: So, when the glorious Season's gon With Princes, and hard times come on, The greatst Calamitys oppress The greatest stil, and spare the less. Nothing's more Dul and Negligent Then an old Lazy Government; That knows no Interest of state, But such as serve a Present Streit, And to patch up, or shift, wil close, Or breake alike with Friends or foes; That runs behinde hand, and has spent It's Credit to the last extent; And the first time 'tis at a Loss Has not one true Friend, nor one Cross. Authority is a Disease, and Cure, Which men can neither want nor wel indure. 'Tis sad That those who rule the world should stil be mad. So Puddles when the sun shines faire In Cloudy Chariots mount the Aire, But when a Storm is raysd, in Raine Fall down in Ditches back againe. What is a Fellon In times of Prosperous Rebellion Such as we happily Live in? When all are Sinners there's no Sin. Authority like wine intoxicates And make's mere fooles of Magistrates, The Fumes of it invade the Braine, And make's them giddy headed, proud and vaine: By this the fool Commands the wise, The Noble with the base Complys, The Sot assume's the rule of wit And Cowards make the Brave submit. He that imploys men for respects, Besides their usefulness, neglects His service for his servants sake, And soon wil finde his own mistake. Authority must not admit Relations that grow under it; 'Tis witchcraft and not powr to know Familiars rising from below. They that go up hil use to bow Their bodys forward, and stoop low, To poyse themselves, and sometimes creep, When th' way is difficult and steep: So those at Court that do addresse By low ignoble offices, Can stoop to any thing, that's base, To wriggle into Trust and grace, Are like to rise to greatness sooner [Then] those that go by worth and honor. All Acts of Grace, and Pardon, and Oblivion, Are meant of Services, that are forgiven; And not of Crimes, Delinquents have committed, And Rather been Rewarded, then acquitted. For Pastures that are newly broken up Are wont to yeld the Plentifullest Crop, And Flowers, that grow among a Field of corn To weeds as bad as thorns, and thistlles turn. LAW For in all Parlaments, The Commoner[s] Are but a kinde of Nursery of Peres, Where all the Disafected to the Court Are turnd to Peres and Sons of Honor for't. A little wit wil serve, and lesser Law A Jury and the witnesses to aw. One Chanc'ler may suffice to Judge a Cause In æquity, but four t' unriddle Laws. The Antient Fleying-off a Judges Skin The best Specifique of the Law has been; Or those that made Frisillian take a swing At Tyborn in a Legislative String. Although Impartial Justice hold the Scales, The Ballance that receives prevayles. For Law can take a Purse in open Court Whilst it Condemne's a less delinquent for't. For Law that make's more knaves then ere it hung, Little Considers right or wrong; But (like Authority) 's soon satisfyd, When 'tis to judg on its own side. Law is like the Laberinth With the two form'd Monster in't, That usd t' eate mans flesh, and devour Al that it got within its Powr. Those that in Licencd Knavrys deal And freely rob the Commonweal And after make the Laws o' th' Land A Refuge against Justice stand, Like thieves that in a Hemplot Ly Securd against the Huon Cry, And make that which they most deser[v]e— A Halter, for Protection serve. Paupers are Plaintifs stil, for no man Sues One that has nothing if hee's cast to loose. In Law all men are understood To b' Infants til their Actions are allowd. There is a mean in things and certaine Lists Beyond or short of which no Right consists. Jury-men are never good and true Until there is a dozen of the Crew. The same man built the Royal Pallace In Paris and Moun[t] Faucon gallows, And afterwards was hangd upon't For bringing in a wrong account: He liv'd and might have don so long But that the fates had spun his thread too strong. When Rookes on lofty Tuf[ts] of Trees Do build their Airy Colonies, If both the owners of a Nest Leave it ungarded, all the rest Prepare t' invade with one Consent, And rob the Naked tenement; Fal on, and plunder it so fast Until their worke is Spoyld with hast. But if the watch, they set to Spy Th' Approaches of the Enemy, Discover the Right owner come, Though ere so far of[f], towards home, They al make hast to get away, And leave behinde the ? Prey. [Law] does not put the Least Restraint Upon our Freedom, but Maintain't. Or, if it did, 'tis for our Good, To give us Freer Latitude: For wholesom Laws Preserve us free, By stinting of our Liberty. As when a greedy Raven sees A Sheep, intangl'd by the Fleece, With hasty Cruelty he flys T' attack him, and pick out his Eyes: So do those Vultures use, that keep Poor Pris'ners fast, like silly Sheep, As greedily to prey on all, That in their rav'nous Clutches fall. For Thorns and Brambles, that came in To wait upon the Curse for Sin, And were no part o' th' first Creation, But for Revenge a new Plantation, Are yet the fit'st materials T' enclose the Earth with living Walls: So Jaylers, that are most accurst, Are found most fit, in being worst. Lawyers that Deal In Right, and wrong do never Buy but Sell, And are sufficiently Supplyd with Both From Publique Stocks, and those of their own Growth. The sword of Justice, Legally Compels All other Arms, to serve for Daggers else, All sorts of Drubs, and Bastinades and Bruises To Pass for Real Stabs in Law Reduces: From whence no Murther is accounted good, Before the Price, and valews understood, Of th' wooden Sword and Dagger, or the Gun Stone, With which the Mortal Feat of Arms was Don. And if the weapon is not worth a Straw The Homicide has don no Hurt in Law. When those that sate for Judges on the Bench Were False, and Senseles as their Pedlers French, Had vaulted ore the Bar with so much slight It was their Luck upon the Bench to light, More Nice and subtle then those wier drawers Of Equity, and Justice, Common Lawyers, And more Impartial then the Judge that Steard His Jurys by the Compas of his Beard And, as to th' Right, or left he turnd the end, Gave Notice for the Plaintif or Defendent. The Ins of Court, from their own Claws Protect the Prisners of the Laws. For what Court ere allowd of Common-bayle, In Coats that had been Primd with Grease, or Ale? Or would Admit the thread-bare, or the Torne, The Freedom to be Publiquely forsworn? Or ever minded Affidavit Oaths, In out-of-fashiond, and Illegall Cloaths? Like him that let out mony to be Payd Upon a Day, swore if it were Delayd And not Dischargd, but half a Day Beyond, He was Resolvd to Teare, or burn the Bond; Or he that su'd a man who told his clock, When falsly, and Erroneously it strook, And would have brought his Action for a Tryal, With one, that did but looke upon the Dial, Or He that Disinherited his Son For Riding on a Caus-way Pavd with Stone: To weare his Horses shoos out, when Beside, There was Plaine Ground, and soft enough to Ride. For Lawyers keep no Equity at all To serve their own occasions, but for Sale, The Real Gryffins of the Common Laws With Griping Talons on their Claws. The Statute-Law's their Scripture, and Reports The Antient Rev'rent Fathers, of their Courts, Records their Generall Councels, and Decisions Of Judges on the Bench, Their sole Traditions: For which, like Catholiques, th' have the greater Awe, As th' Arbitrary, and un-written Law. And strive Perpetually, to make the Standard Of Right, between the Tenent, and the Landlord; And when two Cases, at a Triall, meet And, like Indenturs, Jump exact, and fit: And all the Poynts, like Chequer-Tallys, Suite, The Courte Decides the obstinatst Dispute. There's no Decorum usd, of Time, nor Place, Nor Quality, nor Person, in the Case: But both Picquere in Endles Controversy, Until the one side's forct to yeld to mercy. How much have our Tribunals been Improvd Since Clergymen from Courts have been Removd; And if they had but understood the Law, Had kept the State and Government in awe. No Court Allow's Those Partiall Interlopers Of Law, and Æquity, two Single Paupers, T' Incounter Hand to Hand at Bars, and Trounce Each other Gratis, in a Suit, at once; For one, at one time, and upon Free-cost is Enough to Play the Knave, and Foole with Justice; And when the one Side brings Custome in, And th' other, Lay's out Half the Reconing, The Dev'l himself wil rather Choose to Play At Paltry Smal-Game, then sit out (they say); But when at all, There's nothing to be Got, The old wife, Law, and Justice, wil not trot. For he that trust's the Purblind Hostice Of th' Ins of Court and Chancery, Justice, Must pay his money down before, And be misreacond on the Score. For Justice put's her sword into the Scales, With which she's sayd to weigh out Tru, and False, With No Designe, but, like [the] Antique Gaul, To Get more Money from the Capitoll. For that which Law, and Equity Miscals By th' Empty Idle Names of Tru, or False, Are Nothing else but Maggots blown between False witnesses, and Falser Jury-men. Old Laws have not been sufferd to be Pointed, To Leave th' Interpretation more Disjoynted, And yeld a greater Latitude to wrest On all Emergent Cavil, and Contest. For all the Sense, the Latin tongue Affords Consists in the Last Syllables of words, And, when by Dashes those become in vaine, How should the Sense the same it was Remaine? For what supports the Law, or makes it Good But that it is not to be understood? And therefore Has been (in its own Defence) Writ in a Language, that wil Beare No Sense, And Study'd only in a French Jargone As Rude and as Insignificant as None. [Lawyers] Who never End, but only Prune a Suite, To make it beare the Greater Store of Fruite! For Ten times more is Easier to be Gotten By Interrupting Justice then Promoting. For Law, by Law, can only be Destroyd As Statutes by themselvs are Renderd voyd, Can never be Defeated of its Force But by some Legal, and Judicial Course In which the Forms of Law Destroy the Powr, As Gospell often has been servd before, Until it has Repeald it self and Run With Magna Charta Publique Freedom down: Hence 'tis, of Late, The Fundamental Laws Were forcd the Ruine of themselvs to Cause, For while Puntilios only were Asserted The Government stood Fair to be subverted. For Breaking of the Laws o' th' Land, at least Is more then Half, the Publique Interest, That might as wel have nere been made As Punctually, by evry man, obeyd; For then they would but signify al one, With wisest Governments as if they had been None. For what, but only Breach of Law, Supports The Costly Charge, and Dignity of Courts? That but for Murthers, Frauds, and Stelths, Would be no Parts of Stats and Common-wealths: For how could Justice beare the vast Expence, If none should dare to give the Law offence? For Laws are only valid then Reputed When they can force themselvs to b' executed; But whe[n] th' are freely broke, and do no Hurt, They are but Scornd and Antiquated for't. For 'tis the Constant Fashion of Law Cases To Put on (under one Disguise) two Faces, And Put the Client to the Charg, and Trouble To fine and Pay for understanding double. Those Judges, who before the Cause is Tryd Determine which shalbe the Justest side And Doom like Lightning that Destroys Before the Hearing of the Noyse. For those, that do but Rob and steal enough, Are Punishments and Courts of Justice Proof; And neede not Feare, nor be concernd a Straw In all the Idle Bugbears of the Law, But confidently Rob the Gallows too As wel as other Suffrers of their Due. A Reprobate, or Pious Man, bequeths Their Souls of Course to Heavn at their Deaths, Because there is no Trique in Law, to Pleade A faulse conveiance, to molest the Dead, That wanted Assets, fully to supply, And Pay the Charges, of the Legacy. Who can deserve for breaking of the Laws A greater Penance then an honest Cause? REBELLION The Devil was the first o' th' name, From whom the race of Rebels came, Who was the first bold Undertaker Of bearing Arms against his Maker; And, though miscarrying in th' Event, Was never yet known to repent, Though tumbl'd from the top of bliss Down to the bottomless Abyss; A property which from their Prince The Family owns ever since, And therefore nere repent the evil They do, or suffer, like the Devil. The worst of Rebels never arm To do their Kings or Country harm; But draw their Swords to do them good, As Doctors cure by letting blood. TREACHERY There's no Integrity, where Faith Is not obligd, on Paine of Death; Nor Obligation firm, and Good That is not seald with mutuall Bloud, Where both ingagers, can at will Breake one another on the wheel. There's no Integrity or trust Where Intrest do's not make men Just. Hypocrites with Acted Zeal Take more then tru Saints with the Real, That Pray and fast, but to devour With Greater Greediness and Power. As Truest Glasses Cheat the Sight By Representing Left, for Right, So Right, and wrong, are Counterchang'd And in each others Places Rang'd. One Enemy within the wals Is worth a Troop without as false. All the Politiques of the Great Are like the Cunning of a Cheat, That let's his False Dice freely Run, And Trust's them to themselves alone; But never let's a tru one Stir Without some fingring Trick, or Slur; And, when the Gamsters doubt his Play, Conveys his False Dice safe away, And leaves the Tru ones in the Lurch, T' indure the Torture of the Search. May they be Honest when it is too late, That is undon the only way they hate, Whose words and Actions are al one And both together, Past, and don, And most obliging Favours Civil As kind indearments of the Devil. To Promise only to Betray Is but to cheat, and loose at Play, To venture Credit upon Tick For nothing but to shew a trick. Chineses have their Publique Schooles to teach The Libral Arts to cheat and overreach. Treachery's a Princely Sport The only Royal Game of Court. It is in vaine for Cheats to fix 'Mong those, that understand their Trick[s]: Who therefor Change the Aire, and Stroul, To Catch the fresh unwary foul. The Man, that for Profit's brought t' obey Is only hir'd, on Liking, to betray; And when he's bid a liberaller Price, Will not be sluggish in the Work, nor nice. For those are but Probatione[r]s That have but once been Perjurers, And have no[t] don their Exercise Till Th' have betrayd and Perjured twice, The Sacrament of Confirmation To Fix 'em Constant to the Nation. Wheedleing and Shaming at the best Is but a kinde of Knavery in Jest. As Gamsters Practice for their Exercise The Liberal Arts of Cheating with tru dice. In the Dark and Secret Passages That ly between the other world and this, One mortal Cheat's another of his Right, As Burglares break houses in the Night, And, at the wills and Pleasures of theyr mothers, Transfer their Claimes, before th'are born, to others. What should I do at Rome? I cannot Ly, Or if a Book be Bad, Commend and Buy: I understand no Mathematique Skill, Nor can Prædict a Fathers Death, nor will. Others can beare, what Leachers use to send New marryd wives, and what the[y] say Commend: I cannot Steal; nor give the Least Releife, In Acting of a Robbery, t' a Thiefe: And therefore Go alone, like one, that's maimd Of his Right-hand, and for a Cripple Lamd. Words are but th' outside of the minde But all the Art is how 'tis lind. INJUSTICE Treachery and violence Are Dutys, binde the conscience, And such as no Man ought t' omit When Providence makes way for it. Murthers are bewayld and Pittyd By those by whom they were Committed. Ungratefull men do nere forgive The bad they do, or good receive. In little Trades more cheats and Lying Are used in selling, then in buying; But in the Great, unjuster dealing Is used in buying, then in selling. For Prejudice condemn's unheard And still the worst Sense is preferd. Many have been forcd to take A Turn at Tybourn by mistake; 'Tis but an Error of the Court: The Law is nere th' unjuster for't. Men who change Sides have no concerns For any, but to serve their Turnes. And that b'ing don; th' have learnd one way The Readier after to betray. MODERN WAR All Feates of Armes are now abridgd To sieges, or to b'ing besieg'd. And hee's the Formidablest Soldier Who fly's (like Crows) the smel of Powder. To digging up of Sceletons, To make Brown Georges of the Bones. It is not wearing Armes of Proofe Lin'd through with Shirts of Male and Buff But marching naked in the cold That makes men valorous and bold; Nor swords, nor Bullets, nor Bloudshed, But stealing one anothers Bread And eating nothing out of mode But what's in Season Frog, or Toad. All Blows are at the Belly aimd Untill 'tis slain outright or maymd; And one anothers motions watch Only to ly upon the Catch. To understand the Time, and Reason When Toads, and vermine are in Season, When Frogs come in, and what's the Cause Why July Spiders make best sause; As if the wars of Frogs and Mice Had been of ours but Prophesies: For greater Crowds are slaine of those Then upon both sides now of Foes. No feates of Armes are now in mode But only living without Food, Nor weapons handled but for show, Disease and Famine are the Foe; And he that against both is Proofe, Can eate his Bootes and feed on Buff, Is held impregnable in Armes, And more, then shotfree made by Charmes. They do not manage the Contest By fighting, but by starving best; And hee that's able to fast longest Is sure in th' end to be the strongest. He that can dine upon Mundungus, Is held the valiants[t] man among us And those the Formidablest Forces That never mount but eat their Horses And make 'em serve in th' expedition For Cavalry and Amunition; No Helmets now are in Request, Nor Curacer, nor back, nor Brest; Nor Armes of Proof accounted good Because they will not serve for food. Civil war, like letting-bloud To voyd the Bad let's out the Good. Fighting now is out of Mode, And Stratagem, the only Roade, Unless in th' out-of Fashion'd wars Of Barbrous Turkes and Polanders. They laugh at Fighting in the field Till one Side Run away, or yeld, But manage all a Safer way, Like th' Ancient sword and Buckler play, And Loyter out a whole Campaine To forrage only, and Trepan. All Feats of Armes are now Reduc'd To Chowsing, or to being Chowsd; And no Rencounters so Renownd As those on wals or underground. They fight not now to overthrow But Gull, and Circumvent a Fo; And watch all Smal Advantages, As if they fought a Game at chess. And he's approvd the most deserving, Who longest can hold out at sterving, Can make best Fricasies of Cats ? of Frogs and mice and rats, Potage of vermine, and Rhagoos Of Trunks and Boxes, and old Shoos; And those, who, like th' Immortal Gods, Do never eate, have still the Ods. ? All their warlike Stratagems Are subtle ferring over Streames, Or Playing at Bo-peep with Bridges, Or Crawling under ground at Sieges, Or swimming over deepest Channels T' avoyd the Fo, like water Spaniels. 'Tis Strange; That wars, that Lay Pretence To Piety, and Conscience, Should more Inhumanly be wag'd Then those on other Scores ingagd. What Arms Defensive but a wal Are Proof against a Canon-Ball Or strong enough to make Resistance Unles by keeping [at a] Distance? COWARDISE [Cowards] Like Horses, do Heroique Acts, Ingage by turning of their Backs, And use the same Heeles, both for fight With th' enemy, and persuite, or flight: So with the same Armes kill and slay And Rout the Fo and run away. He that ore-comes himself, and runs Do's more then he that takes great towns: If evry man would save but one No victory would ere be won: For he that runs may fight again, Which he can never do that's slain. Battles but in fancy wag'd With better Conduct are ingagd Then bravest fights at Sea or land Where Fortune has so great a hand. A Sword Fish fights with greater Art Because the warrior has no Heart. Strong Reserves in War are plac't To bear the Brunt of Danger last, As Hangmen blind the eies and ty The Hands of wretches doomd to dy. He that is all Heart Is kill'd with the least Prick in any Part, And, therefore, ougt to have the greater care In Fight than he, that has a lesser share. HOPE For greater Numbers have been lost by Hopes, Then all the Magazins of Daggers, Ropes: And other Amunitions of Despaire, Were ever able to Dispatch, by Feare. [Fears] Do better offices to Human Nature Then Hopes, that only humor us, and Flatter, That all our Future Happiness Fore-stalls, And Runs us out of it, before it Falls: When all our Expectations are alloyd And thrown away, before they are Injoyd: While nothing our Fælicity's Indear's Like that which falls among our Doubts, and Fears, And in the miserablest of distress, Improv's Attempts as Desprate, with success. Succes that owns, and Justifys all Quarrels; And vindicates Deserts of Hempe, with Lawrells. Or but miscarry[i]ng in the Bold Attempt Turnes wreaths of Lawrell back again, to Hemp. FEARE For Feare, and Fiends are Cussen-Germans And Partners in the same Determents, Apparreld in the same Disguise Of Hornes and Tayles, and Sawcer eies. Make Fancy Cut of[f] Child[r]ens Heads Before they're Born, with sudden Dreads, And more Impossibly, convey The executed Part away. Cowards, like Hot Iron Drencht, Are hardend more, the more th'are quencht. THEFT 'Tis Counted Cunning to Retrive And find out by a Thief a Thiefe; But nothing is more Sottish, then To finde out thieves by honest men. Crimes Punishd, like the weapon Salve Heal up the wounds and Hurts they gave. For as the Roman Souldiers once, When they were Plundering of Towns, And Robbing of their Churches; found In one a Little hole i' th' Ground, Which having greedily unclosd, To finde out Treasure, they supposd Was there conceald: out flew a Dampe That spread Contagion through the Campe, And suddenly strook many Dead; From whence, by slow Degrees, it spread From Place, to Place, til it Possest All the wide world, from East to west: So, when Rude Mortals boldly search For Gain, and Plunder, in the Church, And Sacrilegiously teare Her Schismes wider then they were, A Horrid Plague breaks out, that kills The wretches first, and after fills The whole world, like a General Floud Of Desolation, war and Bloud. Why should not Piety be made As wel as Equity, a Trade? And men get mony by Devotion As wel as making of a Motion? B' allowd to Pray upon Conditions As well as Suiters in Petitions? And in a Congregation Pray No less then Chanc'ry for Pay? A Roman Thief was not Affeard To Scrape the Gold of Jupiter's own Beard; And either shewd himself, t' have no Beliefe In Thunder-bolts, or was a Desprate thief. RELIGION A Godly man that has servd out his Time In Holiness; may set up any Crime; As Schollers when th' have taken their Degrees May set up any Faculty they Please, Are free t' administer to Soul or Body Although they never meant it for their Study. The Greatest Saints and Sinners have been made Of Proselytes of one anothers Trad[e]. 'Tis Hard to understand a Proselyte Distinctly, from a wholesale Hypocrite, That one Religion for another trucks: The money of all Fayths is orthodox And lofty'st Steeples have Guilt wethercocks. An Augur Scor'd Imaginary Lines In Heaven, Proper for his own Designes T' observe, and Note the Flight of any Bird That in the Circle of his Scheme Appeared And by the Computation understand Th' Event of his Inquiry before hand. When Egles, Hawks, and Vulturs on their wing[s] Bore all the Interests and fates of Kings A Daw, and Raven, and a Monedula Foretold the Issu of a Suit in Law. A Teachers Doctrine, and his Proof Is all his Province, and enough, But is no more concernd in use The[n] Shoemakers to weare all shoes. For to do Is one thing, and to mean is two. Th' Apostles were but Messengers, And Angels Letter-Carryers, But now a Saint's a Secretary, That open's what they did but carry, And has a Cipher to reveal What they brought only under Seal. Th' Apostate Jews, though zealous Brethren, That worship'd th' Idols of the Heathen, Were punishd by Idolaters Profaner then themselves and worse. A Convert's but a Fly that turns about, After his Head's puld of[f], to finde it out. The Saints, who had Designd to build upon Th' Imperfect Model, of Old Babilon. Had taught their Insignificantest Jabb[e]rers, A Language worse then that of all their Labour[e]rs: For 'twas confounding Languages Fore-run, The Fatal Slavery of Babilon. When Ignorance, and want of understanding, Was all Reducd to Controversy, and Bandy[i]ng. And vowd to settle Church, and Commonweal, Upon Dissenting Principles of Zeale. When all Pretenders venturd to Proscribe The Rest, that were not of their Chosen Tribe: And made 'em guilty Spiritual Bandittys, Exild from all great Burrough-Towns and Citty[s]: And Banishd them like Criminals, to Lurke In Obscure Cottages to do their work. The Good old Cause, Interpreters believe To be the serpent, that had tempted Eve, And taught her to tempt Adam out of Eden, With godlike Gifts, and Fruit that was forbidden, And when the Saints, began at first t' adore Was Titled old, for what it did before When all her Talent could not understand But how to break themselvs, and one Command, And ever since that time, do's still invite The world to Disobedience with New light. Whence Saints of all Religions, use t' exclame, And one anothers Dispensations Damne: Who once would have Admitted Presbyters, Upon their Good-behavior, for three years: But that there could no Common-Baite be found That to such hard Conditions would be Bound; By Rapine, Bloud, and Tyranny Profess New ways, of Suffering for Righteousnes; And by Revenge, and Insolence Propose The Evangelique Course, of taking Blows: For Pardons are Ill Characters of Saints, As due to those, wee have don Il against. And do but work, the same Effects; Reprievs Are wont to do, upon the stubbornst Thieves: Who apprehend, They have the Greater wrong, Only because they are but Half-unhung; And therefore understand the Grace, and Favour, To be but Binding to the Good Behavior: Which make's th' Afflicted wretches live in Paine, Untill th' have don the Injury againe. Which when an Opportunity falls out, They never let a Moment slip to do't. For when the Lashes of a Conscience smart, Layd on severly by its own Desert, The Guilty Suffrer thinks it comes from those, From whom (he knows) He has deservd the Blows: And still Abhor and hate 'em, more, and more, The more th' have don them Injury before. As Huntsmen use to chace the wounded Deare, But those that have Receivd no Hurt, Forbeare; For Zealous Men, must be Allowd The Hot Distempers of their Bloud: That is not calculated, for the Coole, And Sober Temper of a Christian Rule; Enough to make the Rigor of Devotion, Keep within Compass of Abundant Caution, But frequently is apt to loose his Credit, For being Peremptory, and Hot-Headed; When temper only has Supplyd the Place Of all their High Prerogativs of Grace: And that which once past for the word Reveal'd, Is only now the old Dead Letter Held: And that which was the Spiritual Light within one, Reducd to Fancy only and opinion. For the best Temperd Saints, are more Stiff-necked Then all the Hottest-headed of the wicked, Are Sons so Fierce, and Zealous of the Church, Some Guess they were begotten in the Porch. Have got themse[l]vs a General Reputation, Of welth, and Zeal, and Numbers in the Nation: By driving Proselyts like Head's of Beasts, From other Churches, and their Interests: For what else makes, a Richman's esteemd So hard, and Difficult to be Redeemd, But that th' have Mony, to lay down the Prices, Of all the Dearst Iniquitys, and vices? And tho the Cause profanely did Propose To take up Arms, for holy Purposes, That Scruple Awd th' Erroneous Rabble more Then all the Right of Just, and Lawfull Powr: As Post appeare t' have Spurs, and Switches, worse Then those that gen[t]ly Ride a Startled Horse. For Gifted men, in little Benefices, Use to conform, according to the Prices: Like him, who lately venturd to Ingross A Parish Church, and Conventicle House; Read Common Prayr, and after Preachd it downe, And hid his Surples underneath his Gown: Which some Free Consciencd Saints, affirmd hee wore, And to trepan the Visitation, swore: Untill in Contemplation of the oath, And Impious fraud, He was turnd out of both. For Zealous Saints are but Probationer[s], That have but once Incurd the Loss of Eares: But have not don their usuall exercise Untill they have Betrayd, and Perjurd, twice, The solemne Sacrament of Confirmation To fix Perfidiousnes upon the Nation. Abhord to Read the Common-Prair, as vaine, And Superstitious, Popish, and Profane: But Really, because th' have no Occasions, By Spelling, to Hold-forth their Dispensations: And th' Ablest of their Brethren, have no shifts, For Setting off the Meanest, of their Gifts. As if they were but such Notorious Knaves, In Nature, as they use to make their Braves; Before their Extraordinary conversions, And turning th' Inside outward of the[i]r Persons: Tho some are Confident, 'Tis but to Raise Their own cooperating work of Grace: Whose Gifts are not to be confided in, Where Nature was so Influencd by Sin. That never has been known to Quit the least Puntilio, wholly of her Interest. For Zeal is only Proper to Imbroyle, To overturne, Disorder, and to Spoyle, But has no Temper, Jugment, nor Discretion, To manage things of Consequence in Reason; But roote, and Branch, at Random, to demolish Unsight, unseen; and Cross, or Pile abolish. For Sober Reason, takes to Complesance, No less then Pertinacy, t' Ignorance: And as a Crutch, or wooden Leg, is stiffer Then one that has its Natrall Joynts, they Differ: That b'ing in Orders, to Divide the world, Was after to Divide the Church Impourd: And gave no Quarter to the Carnall, vaine, The Naturall, and Morall, or Profane; But always Prov'd abhominably shy At Taking Notice of Hypocrisy, For feare their Hands should slip, and hit upon These Natural Endowments, of their owne. As if the Brethren did not mean to win By fair Means, Heavn, but rather take it in: And therefore, like the Antique Gyants, Arme To fall by onslaught, on the Place, and Storme Had rather venture Force, and violence Then any other way before, or since: For all New lights avoyd the Beaten Path To Heav'n; Good works, and Charity, and Faith. Whose Piety, and Zeal to send a Martyr, T' æternity's so great, they give no Quarter: For were not swords, and Daggers, and Edg-tools The only means, to save Th' Apostles Soules? The Turks that have such gentle Tendernesses, For Brutish Animals, of evry Species: Are by their false Religion, taught t' have none, But Naturall Defyance to their own. Who when th' have payd, the Ransom of a Bird, Wil perjure, to have Christians Massacerd. Where Charity, and Cruelty are Drest, And in their Native Types at once exprest. Religion once was wrapt-up in Disguise Of mystique Fables, and Mythologies; But Modern Nonsense, without Parables, Pass Muster in Religious Shape, and zeales: Is like the Indian River-Fish, that's sed To have a Magot breeding in his head, And therefore Natrally 's observd, to stem His constant Directly against the Streame. No Phrygian Turk durst ever Counterfet Or Try to Act the Part, of Mahomet, Assumd his Borrowd Person, in Disguise, Upon his New Return from Paradice, With tru, or False Pretences, to maintaine His Antient Promise, to Come back againe: When Jews, and Christians, or some counted such, In evry Age have undertooke as much That more then twelve Messiases at least, Have ownd the sacre[d] Function, and Profest: That 'tis a Miracle, wee have no more, But Nayler, to set up, upon that Score: Enough to settle Infamy, and shame, Upon the Christian Interest, and Name: But that Fanatiques have been found t' attone, And blot out all, with what themselvs have don. For Saints are too transcendent and Sublime To be suspected, but to own a Crime; And when 'tis Acted, like a modern Saint Not ask a Pardon for it, but maintain't. Impenitence keep's up their Reputation, As if they never had deservd th' occasion. The Preachers in the Prologue of a Prayr, Turn Sins to Gifts, and tell how great they are. For 'tis the greatest Signe of Gifts, and Graces To Magnify their Sins, by varying P[h]rases. And he that dos it, with the Greatest Art Is held a Man, of Singular Desert. Men take up Religion, just As they do other things on trust: 'Tis all one at how hard a Rate To those who never meane to pay't. The Church of Rome bende's Heretiques With Flames of Fire, like Crooked Sticks. And transubstanciat's them with Tricks To zealous Fire-new Catholicks. So Chymists transubstantiate Base Mettles in the Fire to Plate. Religion is the Interest of Churches That sel in other worlds, in this to Purchase. Good workes are nothing but to give, And merit only to Relieve. The Antient Pagans kept their Chequers Securd in temples from their own Church-breakers More safe, then Christians can, the Poorman Box, Tho Double Fortifyd, with Plats and Locks. Our Blessed Savior never did Discover To his Disciples, what he was to suffer, Who therefore strove to Præposses th' Injoyments In his New Kingdom, of the best Imployments. ZEAL No seard Conscience is so fel As that which has been burnt with zeal; For Christian Charity's as well A great Impediment to Zeal As Zeal a Pestilent Disease To Christian Charity and Peace. Who did ever know a Saint That Acted th' Horridst Crime Recant? Their Priviledg is too sublime To condescend to own a Crime, Who Count it a Disparagment To be but thought to need Repent. Hypocrisy will serve as well To Propagate a Church, as Zeal; As Persecution and Promotion Do Equally Advance Devotion: So Round white Stones wil serve, they say, As wel as Egs to make hens lay. CRUELTY For the first Murther that we finde Was ere Committed by Mankind By zealous Rage, and Fury, about Religious worship first fell out; When fierce Cain having kild his Brother One fourth of Mankind slew the other. And ever since an æqual Rate Of all the world has had that Fate. For when a Gap was made for Sin Mad Zeal, and murther first broke in. CONSCIENCE For wise and Cautious Consciences Are Free to take what course they please. Have Plenary Indulgence, to Dispose At Pleasure of the strictest vows, And Chaleng Heavn they made 'em to, To vouch and witness what they do. And when they prove averse and loath, Yet for convenience take an Oath; Not only can dispense, but make it A greater Sin to keep, then take it; Can binde and loose all Sorts of Sin, And only keepe's the keys within; Has no Superior to Controul, But what it selfe sets ore the Soule; And, when it is injoyn'd t' obey, Is but Confin'd, and keepe's the key; Can walk invisible, and where, And when, [and] how it will, appeare; Can turn it selfe into Disguises Of all sorts, for all sorts of vices; Can transubstantiate, Metamorphose, And Charme whole Heards of Beasts, like Orpheus; Make woods, and Tenements, and Lands Obey, and follow it's Commands, And settle on a New Freehold, As Marcly-Hill, removd of old; Make mountaines move with greater force, Then Faith, to New Proprietors; And perjure to secure th' Injoyments Of Publique Charges, and Imployments: For True, and Faithfull, Good and Just Are but Preparatives to Trust, The Guilt, and Ornament of things And not their Movements, wheels, and Springs. How many Offices, and Places Would salve a Conscience in all Cases! Hence 'twas he raysd his Price so high That what one Place before would buy Now all together in a Lump Would not Come up to his Accompt. For He Reducd all things to Trade, And both for right, and wrong was payd. Conscience is a Damnd Lampooner, That Feares no Court of Law, nor Honor. Because a Feeble Limb's Carest, And more Indulgd then all the Rest; So frayle and tender Consciences Be humord to do what the[y] please; When that, which Go's for weak and Feeble, Is found the most Incorrigible, To outdo all the Fiends in Hel With Rapine, Murther, Bloud and Zeal. Tender Conscience, Th' half-stervd Snake, Which those that in their Bosoms take To cherish, are Rewarded for't And stung with Gratitude to th' Hart. FANATIQUES Saints of A Negative Profession Like Independent Sense, and Reason. A Mungrell Sect that has its Being From nothing else, but Disagreeing: Containes as many Diffrent Sects As Pillorys Fit Sevrall Necks. Fanatiques hold the Scripture do's not bar The Bearing of False witnes, for A Spiritual Neighbor, but against: For only that's forbid the Saints. When some, among 'em, have had cals To sweare for Brethren, tru, or False That have been Bred up by the Saints To sweare, without the least Restraints, Which when it do's not Reach to Bloud Weighs nothing with the Brotherhood. Like other malefactors, only heed Religions, that the Laws o' th' Land forbid. [A Brother] Who strayns so hard upon a Poynt Untill his Bones are out of Joynt, And, when his sermons don and Prayr, Is Rubd down like a Tennis-Player. Why should not Handicrafts be made A Church, as wel, as that a Trade? Are Holders-forth, or Presbyters The worse for turning Usurers? Or Was John ere the worst Divine For Selling Ale, and Cakes, or wine? Or do's a Cuntry Vicar Preach False Doctrine, when he turns a Leach? And makes it equally his Study T' Administer to Soul, and Body? And keep's his Parishes Glebe Lands Without Compounding, in his Hands? And should not shopkeepers as wel B' allowd to teach and buy and sel? Or in the Belfrey keep a School, Without neglecting of one Soul? People of such eternal Lungs, And indefatigable Tongues, That, though no Motive is so able, As Creature-comforts on a Table, T' engage them to put mod'rate stints Unto their spiritual Gifts, and Hints; Yet, if the Grace be not begun, Before the Dinner is laid down, It will be burnt, and cold agen, Ere they come half way to Amen. For Kings as well may lay Embargo Upon the heav'nly good Ship Argo As think by Laws to put restraint Upon the workings of the Saints. PRELATES That make the Grace of God Create a Prince But smallest Prælats, Divine Providence, And all of Th' order Lord's Spiritual call In meare Distinction from the Temporall, Altho their Honors are Intaild upon Their Families, when they themselvs have none: Would make a King believe, Hee's a Phantastique Mixt Person, Laique and Ecclesiastique; And, when they could not Render Prælats Princes, Made Princes Priests, to serve them for Pretences. The Roman Emprors, in their Hands at Home Preservd the Chief Epi[s]copacy of Rome; And had soe Absolute a Jur[i]sdiction, Their greatest Lawes were nothing but Rescription: But when some weake ones gave that Powr the Pope, The East, and west was lost beyond all Hope. All Revrend Persons never use to stick At Marriage, but for an Archbishopprick. POPERY The Pope himself allows a licencd Sinner, No more for once, then servs to buy her Dinner. [Priests] Are by their Lady votaries, with the Best Of all their Curiositys, carest, And when th' are searcht for, meet with no Anoyance But feeding upon Sweet-meats i' th' Conveyance. The Images of Saints, like Easops Logs, Are thrown from Heaven down to Govern Frogs. The Romish Priests, and Turkish Janizarys Are both Supply'd with Christian Seminarys; Who have no Lawfull Issue of their own T' uphold the Legend, or the Alchoron: Yet, by the Great Conformity between The Roman-Clergy, and the Musselmen, Will not Allow their Churches to Consist Of Mungrels, gotten by a Turk, or Priest: For Jesuits and Turks Improve the Breed Of both their Sects, by changing of the Seed. The Pope, that Lay's his Title, and Pretence, T' Infallibility, has the Least of Sense: Is faine t' avoyd a Street, in Rome, for Dread, Of being turnd t' a whore, and brought to Bed: By virtu only, of th' Infallible Chair To get the Church, upon himself, an Heir. Who first set Townes on Fire For Heretiques Till Canon-Law th' Inhabitants convicts. An old Religion, nothing but a Mode, Far-fet from Hence, and too Deare bought abroad. Which would have brought the Interlopers in Too Rich a trade of Slavery and Sin. That were Resolv'd to turn the Devils Tenants, And take to Farme of him, a Sinners Penance. To pay down all their Rents upon, their Skins, To him, and his Joynt Purchacer of Sins. According to the Custome of the Manner Which all his Native vassels hold by Tenure And first Receivd from the Fanatique Jews That put the Reformation first in use. For Popery with us was but in Type, Before the Greatst Impietys grew Ripe When in th' excess, and Fulnes of Deboshing, It was Declar'd and Publish'd for Devotion. Have Fairs and Mercats, of all Sorts of Tradesmen Fryres, Hermits, Munks, and Seculars, and Beads-men, The most Deplorable of all those Dunces That strove t' Import Religion from beyond Seas. For Roman Pænitents are wont to play The Guilt of all their Pænances away; Where He that looses, freely takes the Sins Upon his own Accompt, of him, that wins, And is content to lay the Heavyst Sack Of others consciences, upon his Back. The Roman Mufty, with his Triple crowne, Do's both the Earth, and Hell, and Heaven Owne: Besides th' Imaginary Territory He lay's his Title to, In Purgatory; Declares himselfe, an Absolute Free Prince In his Dominions, only over Sins. But as for Heav'n (since it Ly's so far Above him) is but only Titular. And, like his Cross-Keiys-Badge upon a Taverne, Has nothing there, to tempt, command or Govern. Yet when he come's, to take Accompt, and share The Profit of his Prostituted ware, He findes his Gaines Increse, by Sin and women, Above his Richest Titular Dominion. A Jubile, is but a Spiritual Fair, T' expose to Sale, all Sorts of Impious ware; In which his Holynes buy's nothing in, To stock his Magazins, but Deadly Sin, And Deale's in extraordinary Crimes That are not vendible at other times; For Dealing both for Judas, and th' High Priest, He makes a Plentifuller Trade of Christ. Can transubstantiate stamps of Lead or Brass And into gold turn Paltry Beads of Glass. For all the Horriblest Impieties Do never fayl to Flock to Jubilies. That Spiritual Pattern of the Church, Noahs Arck, In which the Antient world did once Imbark, Had nere a Helme in't to direct it's way, Altho bound through an universal Sea: When all the Modern Church of Rome's Concern Is nothing else, but in the Helm, and Sterne. An Antient French Pope chose himself, his Heir, And made the Nation Conclave to the Chaire: When all their Anti-Holynesses strove To stand for Antichrist, the next Remove. As He, that with Colonna, cuft a Fray; Was Routed in the fight, and born away: And eate his Fingers for th' Affront he had Receivd in Fight, until he dy'd starck-mad. [The Pope] By Chymique Transubstantiation turn's To Crowns of Gold, one Crown of thorns, And wear's them ore three words, instead Of ne're a Place to Rest his Head. When the Jews had kild the Heir, Priests took Th' Inheritance to share. There's no Cheat in al the world nor Trick But has a Twang, and Smack, o' th' Catholique. What numerous Ly's and Errors did the Days Of Popery, among the Rabble Raise! As Friers in their Long Capouches Store up their Privat Close Deboches And weare them on their Backs behind As out of Sight as out of minde. As in the Church of Rome, to go to shrift Is but to put a Soul on a New shift. The Greatest Complements are Found most False As Cardinals that visit Cardinals Are stript in Querpo, really to know If they have Armes under their Robes or no, And al their Counterfet Civility[s] Are nothing else but [t'] avoyd Surprize, But in Pretence, to let them understand They are at Home, and all things there Command. A Papist Is but an Ignorant, Implicit Atheist, That thinks to be Relig[ious] without Piety, And Eats, instead of worshiping the Deity, As Woolsy Puld down many a Monastery To build a Church to Christ and his own Glory. Jesuits are taught obedience Before they'r sufferd to Learn Impudence, And Counterfet a Sheepish Look before They come to set for wolvs up, and Devour. Their Leaving of[f] the Habits of the Brothers And wearing those they Please, of any others; Their Living out of Covents, Free and Cleare, From any thing, that's Rigid, and Severe, Their Arbitrary Intrest, [and] Dominion Ore other mens Concernments, and their women, Makes some in taking Orders, not so Nice, As Possibly they might have been, otherwise. Some zealous Men in orders more Confirms Tho Probably th' had been on other tearms. GLUTTONY A wretch ingendred in his food, As French Punayses are in wood, That ows his Being to his Guts, As Magots breed in Cheese or Nuts, Spawnd at the Mouth, as Fishes Breed, And formd for nothing but to feed. Had eate his Head out in a Trice, Like Adam out of Paradice. More Greedy then the Pox that swallow's So many Mortals; or the Gallows, That in a Quarter of an hour Cart-loads of Sinners can devour. As thousands are Distroyd by Surfet: For evry one that's found to sterv yet. That with their Glutony feed their other Sins, As Serpents use to cast, and eate their Skins. TIME Time Allow's the shortest measure, And Deale's with falsest weights, in Pleasure: Steale's th' Idle, and it selfe, away, And is the Greatest Cheate, in Play. There are no Vizard-Masks, nor Fans, To keep Age from a Countenance. Time made Truth (like Elnor at Queen Hythe) Sinke under Ground, for Feare to Spoyle his Syth: For, thoug[h] at once it mow down Age and Youth, It turn's Edge, when it ventures upon Truth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX TENTATIVE LINES ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS Wit and Folly And when his wit has leakd it's moysture Is empty as a Gaping Oyster. And might as wel for prophets pas As Livies Calf or Balams Ass. In Plays, the last Act's but the Fag And therefore may b' allowd to flag. That do's but Dictate and Compile At charge of nothing but the stile, Which al that chance to light upon May freely chaleng as their own. This sayd—Another of the Crew Stood up, and sayd—This is to shew How easy things that are above Or under Reason are to Prove, And how far wit upon the Stretch In things that are not fixt; wil reach, That may be wrested any way, But never Renderd at a Stay; Or if they are, unfix mens Braines, And seldom prove worth half the Paines: For Demonstrations rarely Rise T' outweigh mere Probabilities, And, though most Certaine, yet th' are such In matters that import not much, Are like Mecha[n]iques, Tru in small Designes, but greater, not at all: For who would give a Straw to know The Reason one and one make two? But Probables, that nere Conclude, Are of a Nobler Latitude. For Subtlety and Politiques Alloy great valours when they mix. Fooles in Judging Are Faine to swallow many a Gudgin. And Cheat themselves with Tricks as False As Gamsters Dice, or Juglers Bals. But, if she takes to virtuosing To Dabling, Scribling and Composing, Shee's more insufferable yet And gives no Quarter with her wit; On both sides Moote's upon all Cases With Love and Honor Common Places; Runs down the Stars, and has the Ods At Reprimands of all the Gods, And Rants, as if they were no more But Statues stil as heretofore And, like their Images, but Logs Thrown down from Heav'n to govern Frogs; And is a Dreadfuller Earestretcher The[n] the Ablest Conventicle Teacher; But, if she takes to sing or fiddle, Her vertus center in the middle, The Sphere to which al virtu tends, And leaves to vice ? Ends; Does all her Feates by mode and fashion And Clips false Coyn of Affectation; At selling Bargaines, far exceeds The Signe of the three Logger heads, And cry's down al that is not wit With Fire and Flame as Juglers spit. As if his Tongue had got the Bit, And Ran away with all his wit. Like Races, where the longest winde Leave's all the Shorter-breathd behind And strive's to make his Rams-horns blow With Noyses alone, down Jericho. Dilemmas of Polemique wits When if one misse, the other hit's. Pride As when Dogs set up their Tayles in Pride Th' expose those Parts that Nature meant to hide. Learning When most men have so hard a task, to shun Their being by themselvs imposd upon. An able Judge may have a Heavy head As Gold and Silver's tryd with Tests of Lead. Who, like a Skilful Rhetorician, Knew how to order his Transition So Cunningly, the Quickest Sense Could nere unriddle his Pretence, Nor what he went about Discover, Untill the whole Design was over. For Truth and Falshood, like a Gun, that's shot Make æquall Noyses, tho they hit, or Not: And some still growe the worse, the more they Reade As Elks (they say) Go Backwards, when they feed. The New Divice of Fiddle strings, to Rayse Above the Mean, or Tenor-Part; the Base: For when two Strings are straind t' an unison (A greater and a less) and stil straind on (Both æqually) the greater wilbe found, B'ing straind before, to have the Higher sound. A wondrous Hard Invention to unriddle The Natrall Reason of, upon the Fiddle, Which Gallileo shew'd himself an Ass To take no Notice of, but overpas. So those that by the Oracle had been Infallibly Declard the wisest Men, Were but affected Humorists and Drols, That might have past as wel for Errant Fooles, That held it wisdom freely to commit All sorts of madnes, when the Magot Bit. Which some were faine to counterfet and Act, T' avoyd the Law, that favours the Distract; And one of them, made statutes, that concern The Regulating al that Teach, or Learne. Did not omit Proviso's for their Play, But put it, in a Legislative way, That nobody could play at Trap, or Ball, Unless it were allowd Juridicall, With Peremptory Injunctions, and Commands About the Managment of Clokes, and Bands, Mad[e] Rules to spit, and after tread it out More Regular then ever had been taught, Made Politique Provisos, to Put off Their Breaking winde with sneeres, or a Coffe; That Tully (had he lived then) had abstained To rub his face so often with his Hand. For those that valew things too cheap, or Deare, More then the Standard of the world wil Beare: Mistake Th' Intrinsique Rate, and put their Talents, And Inclinations, only in the Ballance: And those, to whom the Hardest things are cleare, Will make the Plaine as Difficult appeare; When all the Antients fancyd of the Trick Was but a Stoiques Earthen Candle-stick, That to some Pædants of his Tribe was Sold, And Purchacd for its weight in Ready Gold. So he, that sainted Queen Elizabeth So many Scores of yeares, before her Death, And cald her Diva, Th' Antients nere allowd To any Prince, till Dead, and made a God. And, tho the Learnedst of our Antiquarys, Let such a Blemish on her Commentarys. The sturdy Gaul bore Cæsar, like a Sack, H' had Loaded Prisner ore his Horses Back, A Greater Captive then the Roman Foe, Who had been taken Prisner, by a Crow. Extravagances wil not Pass in Nature On those that live so many Ages After, Tho all the world indeavors to excuse The most Prodigious Custome of their use, Like Boys, and Girles Implicitly held best To Gather in their Spices, in the East. Or that Blind Moor that smelling to a Clod Led on the Caravan upon the Road, As one that is of Classical Esteeme Relates the Story, and the Rest from him. If any have so feeble a Beliefe To credit such a monstrous Narrative. For men that are in Greatest want of Sense Have all and more supplyd by confidence; And, as some Printers have (among the Popish) Been Hangd for Printing truer then their Copies, It is a Dangrous thing, for those that write All sorts of Truths, to bee too much i' th' Right. Like him that usd to stand al Day and night Congeald into a Posture bolt upright, A Deep occult Philosopher and Scribe, The Lutum Sapientiae of his Tribe. For those that take most Pains to under[stan]d, Like great Estates Run furthest behind hand, Retaine the measure, which at School they took, When only for the words, they read a book. And all their freest thoughts, can never leave What Custome first Ingagd 'em to receive; Who still the more, they Toyle in Books and Drudge, Are found the more untowardly to Judge, Resolve i' th' Dark of Matters ere so Hard, Like Jury men of Fire, and Light debard: That many a Learned Metaphysique Clarke Has been bred-up, Like Singing Birds, i' th' Dark. Chaldeans brag th' have been Astrologers, Before the Moon, so many Thousand years: But could not Cast their own Nativitys, For want of her, without so many Lyes; Yet those, that can Put down Astrologers And outly those five thousand Falkoners, And Huntsmen, which the Macedonian youth Allowd his Tutor, only to write Truth, The Learnd wil pas for tru, and Current all, If th' Authors have but Past for Classical. [Philosophers] That crack their brains to find out by what trade The fabrick of the world at first was made; Who drew the model of it, and what sect Produc'd the philosophick architect; Or whether chance, necessity, or matter Contriv'd the whole establishment of nature; That all the antique poets were not mad And crackt enough to do it half so bad, Until the deep and learneder Wiseacres Philosophers became the undertakers, Who more stupendiously perform'd the fact, And prov'd themselves more exquisitely crackt; That when the moon's at full a Madman's dreams Are sob'rer than their wisest theorems. Make one man's teeth grow in another's chops, And brew, with ginger, beere, instead of hops; Make silk of canvace, and Virginia grasses, And grind on flakes of ice new burning glasses; Make prawns and crawfish, and all shellfish else With sympathetick powder of their shells; Make chips of Elm produce the largest trees And sowing saw-dust furnish nurseries. For sentences have greater latitude To quibble in, than single words, allowd, The new rhetorick figure clinch and pun, To make two diff'rent senses pass for one, The dear delight of reverend men, whose wit Is grown no further back than childhood yet, And therefore may b' allow'd to play its wild Vagaries in its journey down to child, To jumble contradictions, and make good And bad in the same subject understood, Force wet and dry t' ingage, and hot and cold Like nature in another Chaos hold, A more ingenious and absurd device Then grinding burning-glasses upon ice, Which th' Irish prophet us'd so long ago To light a fire, and burn great heaps of snow, And ought to pass for modish, since the French Have not outgrown Carwichet yet and clench, But use to make the rime and equivoc The sole ingredients of a witty Book; And if they can by chance but make the fadge, Believe th' have gotten ground of all the age, And laugh at all the ignorant liefhebbers, And witless virtuosos of their neighbours. For those that treat of ? are wont To write down all that authours say upon't, But have no further prospect in their thoughts Of reason and invention then their notes; And when they have been laid by and forgot, Admire their parts anew, and put it out: As he that wrote a sturdy musick book, And never knew a note but those he took, Discover'd nations to be brave or base By their pronouncing I's and O's, and A's, Determin'd poetry only by the feet, No matter for the fancy, sense, and wit, Came over to instruct the English nation, And was not only paid with admiration, But for his pains had all he would but ask for, As Merchants Sell glass-beads at Madagascar, And th' Indian-company for paultry trinkets Bring over Orient pearles, and pretious ingots. Whence writers of the later times produc'd A list of all the Authors names they us'd, That alphabetically trac'd begun With Appian, and reach'd to Xenophon; And tho' they never read one syllable Of any one, their names prevail as well To make them pass the publick test instead Of learned men profound and deeply read. And like their Books in Librarys, their Braines Are always tyd up, where they were in Chains: For Scholle[r]s have no way to make a Thesis Hold-out, untill th' have taken it to Pieces, And when they would Determine False, or Tru; 'Tis but because Some other things are so. And all their Art to make obscure things good Depends on nothing but similitude. A vanity that's not the least Ingredient In th' Hotch-potch composition of a Pedant. T' invent's a faculty that's given By th' absolute free grace of heaven; Which nature keeps in her disposing; And all the arts of virtuosing By industry can ne're attain to By any human non obstante. Whence some have found out, how a Separate Ghost In Furious Stormes, and Hurricans, is Tost. Know what they use to Drink, and what they Eate And what they suffer in the Cold, or Heate. That use to write Stupendious Narrative[s] Of all th' Adventures of their After-Lives; Know what makes Form, and Matter stick together As Boys weights with Sope, and Scraps of Leather, Or two Stones ground with æqual Superficies Are Difficultly to be Drawn to Pieces: All which Demonstrated by D.E.F. Among the Learned never miss Belief. Learning and devotion Adord when both were lesse then nothing Had Colleges and Monasterys Erected for their Seminaries, But Scornd as soon as understood, For Better's a Curst Fo to good, And owe their Present maintenance To former Ages of Ignorance. In Sciences have Just enough To talk impertinently of. Like Virtuosos and Industrious The more their Aimes Appear Preposterous. Men are not Dumb, for want of Tongues, but Eares; For nature lets none Speak, before he Heares: To make them learne Good Manners, at th' expence Of such a wonderful Convenience. For Those that take (against her will) a Course T' extend their Latitudes, grow worse, and worse, A Crime as great, as to Remove the Bounds That have been set to th' Property of Grounds. Arts and Sciences Some Arts, and Sciences, are only Tooles Which Students do their Busnes with, in Schools, Although Great men have sayd, 'Tis more Abstruse And Hard to understand 'em, then their use. For, though they were Intended but in Order To better things, few ever venture Further; But as all Good Designs are so accurst, The best intended often Prove the worst. So what was meant t' Improve the world, quite Cross Has turnd to its Calamity and loss. For Scholers are but Jorny men to Nature That shews them al their Tricks to Imitate her; Though some mistake the Reason she Proposes And make her Imitate their Virtuoso's; Is both the Best, or worst way of Instructing As men mistake or understand her Doctrine. The French that Read anatomy-Lecturs Upon the Lineaments of Pictures; And by the Mussles of the Face, Can tell what Thoughts the Dumbe thing has; Could nere unrridle, by his Blinkes, The Crafty Subtleties he thinke's. Draw Models of th' Invisible Mountain That all Philosophy do's Contain, Of which the Sons of Art make Landskips And Copy out their unseen Transcripts. As water thrown on sayles of ships Serv Mariners for Spurs, and whips, And, by opposing of their Course, Do's make them sayl with greater force. Was like those Virtuosos, that Condole Their want of Breeding in a Publique School, Where they, by Robbing Orchards, might have Got The Cabal of Designe, Surprise, and Plot, The Arts of Keeping Counsel with their Fellows In time t' have gone forth Doctors at the Gallows; Such Moral Laws of Judgment, wit, and Art As good as those Tiberius made to fart No doubt, are wondrous like t' improve Mankind If th' are but halfe so wholsom, as the winde. For Raritys in Art Mechanicall Are most admird, when they are don in smal, As th' Indians have Birds as smal as Bees The[y] count their Greatest Curiosities. That count it Art, to understand the Nomen Cneus, or Gaius, of an antique Roman. The Courtly Science Of Application, and Complyance Changd in the Cradle of the Arts Like Soules, and Bodys by DesCartes, Imployd the best Artificers To Labour in their Trades, some years, And, when h' had Learnd their Arts, deducted And Stopt their Pay for b'ing Instructed, And what he understood amiss Past for their own Defaults, not his. Made Rules and Fables to abstract And Ad to evry matt'r of Fact, As if the Art of Horsman-ship Lay only in the Spur and whip. A Man of Eloquence and Stile, He usd to polish much and File, But had no further aime, then clothing In Phrase Polite, and easy-Nothing, Like Dressing Babies Spruce and Fine, Although Deformd in ev'ry Line; Espousd all Controversy of Course, And understood for bett'r or worse. And when he Playd his Tricks would stoop As low as Tumblers through a Hoop, Would make his Application Humbler Then a Two-legd, or a Four-legd Tumbler, As Mastive's on their Bellys Creepe To get a Bul upon the Hip, With all submission and Address Approach his High-and-Mightines, Until th' are got within his Guards And then they fasten their Petards. The greatest Part of Learning's only meant For Curiosity, and Ornament; And therefor most Pretending Virtuosos Like Indians bore their Lips and Flat their Noses, When 'tis their Artificial want of wit, That Spoyls their work, instead of mending it. He that would Pass for Learnd and Polite Must never Speak a vulgar word or write. For Arts and Sciences were over-don Before in Schools they came to be ful-grown, And since their Best Designes have been no more But to Retrench what was too much before, Or else that Pædant was a Ninni hammer That wrote two thousand Books of th' Art of Grammer. For there are more Anomalies in Reason Then in a Schoolboys Difficultest Lesson, That will not be obedient to Rules, Nor own the Jurisdiction of the Schooles. What but Powder of its own Can give a Luster to a Stone? For what's an Anchor but a Hook With which the Greatest Ship is took? Hieroglyphiques Th' Idiom And Language of the Deaf and Dumbe. Pædants An Elephant['s] Proboscis is a Paw That serv's him, to lay hold, and Pul, and draw. For when the Comment Creeps into the Texts No Critique such a Desprat Flaw Corrects. An Amorous Pædant at the same Time whips And makes Adresses to the School Boys hipes And when the Poor Delinquent cannot Pearce Apply[s] his services to Madam ? And, haveing had his Solace for a while, Waytes till his Happy Stars againe shall smile. Are unconcernd in Insides of their Books As some unsight unseen buy Pigs in Pokes And German Authors usd to set a Price Upon their works, according to the Size. When all his Study is t' appeare at once To Idiots Learnd, and to the Learnd a Dunce. That most unnaturally forcd their Brain In all they undertake against the Grain, As Carts draw Horses down the Steepest Hils Tho with their Natral Legs tyd up their wheels. For evry Language has an Idiom, That's only Graceful when it is at Home. Yet Pædants falsly think, it never Pleases So fully, as in Forraine Modes, and Dresses. The many Inconveniences they Run, Between their Tutors folly, and their own: Has been the Cause, That greater Stores of Fooles Have not been Changd i' th' Cradle then the Schools. That Breed up youth to expiate the Curse, Prepostrously, by making of it worse; Take Paines to Reconcyle those Languages That first had been Divided, for its Ease. For Jesuites are the Regularest Pædants Bred, all their Lives, like Schoolboys, in Obedience And Dare not own a word of Truth, or Reason Unles it be Prescribd 'em for a Lesson. Some use to write a Treatise in a Letter With half a Reame of Paper in't and Better, Enough to Fill the Largest Pacquet-male[s] That ere were sent to th' Jesuits-Generals. Northern Pædagogues Are brought to their Perfection, by the Lugs, As Large as Hounds to Keep their Hearing Close From Hindring, and Diverting of the Nose. Virtuoso That think unjustly to deny A Traveller his Right to Ly, Or Virtuosos Free Command Things how they please to understand. As silly as b' a weathercock To think to finde out what's a Clock. As Antient Statues without Arms or Noses Are Reverencd for their Age by virtuosos. Whence some believe Ægyptian Hieroglyphyques Are all that's left of Natural Specifiques; When evry Letter Signifyd the Nature Of Beasts, and Birds, and Fishes in the water; Which made the Antients Celebrate an Owl For th' only Proper Philosophique Foul. Of time take measure with a string And make it measure any thing. As modern Painters take it for a Glory To steal a Posture, or a Limb in Story, And use it as an Argument they Come Nearest to some Old Greek they stele it from. Who, by the smutty Coullers or the Fair, Can only Judge how New or old they are; Whence some, by being smokd like hams of Bacon, For Antique Masters Hands have been mistaken By those who have no Notion of the lines, The only Rule to Judge of tru Designes. Antiquity And when there is no Natral Difference Betwene the Antique and the modern Sense Admire the Excellencies of the one, And as Implicitly Cry th' other down; [Ap]prove of nothing til 'tis out of Date, [As] Drownd Men use to Swim, when 'tis too late. An Antiquary's better Pleasd with viewing A Prospect of some venerable Ruine Then if it stood as firm and undefacd As if it had not bee[n] s' antiquely raisd. For tho the Critiques, finde no Flaws of Sense In all the writings, of the Antients, Or if they did; Nere offerd to correct A Plain, and most Notorious Defect. But chargd it all upon the Ignorance, And careles Errors of Librarians, Yet in their works, th' are found, as Plentifull As modern Authors, of mistake, and Bull. Who take no Notice, where an Over-sight is, Like him that cald th' Athenians Quirites: Or he that gave Atrides Methridate Some thousand yeares before it's first Receipt. Were fain t' erect a Chancery of Figures, To Over-Rule the Peevish Critiques Rigors, That when the Learnd, were Guilty of a Flaw, Against the Sense, and Letter, of the Law, Th' Offender, by the known Rules of the Court Might be Relievd, and stand ackwitted For't. Which since has been allowd of, for a Trick In æquity, and held for Rhetorique. For had the Antients had the luck to know Our way of Binding Books that's Practicd now, The world had never lost so many Pieces Of Celebrated Authors as it misses. History The Saxons rooted al Religion out And afterward became the most Devout. The Barbarous Goth, and savage Hun Could by no Human Power be won T' indure Civility, and Artes Til th' had destroyd 'em in al Parts. So Paul the second was no sooner made Christ Vicar, from a Merchant by his trade, But he convicted those of Heresy That did but Name an university. Like the French Hercules, and as strong In all the Labours of the Tongue. As Socrates stood Day, and Night In one Stiff Posture Bolt upright. That for their goodly length and Space Are of the true Arcadian Race. Like Alexanders Steward Demophon, Scorchd in the Shade, and Frozen in the Sun. The antient Greeks, kept constantly their Guards To save, from Storms of Hayle, their viniards; And when the least Suspected Cloud Appeard, T' avert the Tempest, sacrificd a Bird. King Harry the eighth had many a Mistress And yet there's no News of their Names in Historys. As he that made his Queen to ride Naked through Coventry astryde. Like Chinese Ladys where the Fair and comely Are faine to pay the Portions of the Homely. Th' Americans had no wit, and less Beard, When to the first Discovrers, th' Appeard. In Spain the greatest Ladys that Ly in Are fancyd with Rich Presents by their kin, And for their Paines in serving of the State Are Payd in Duckatoons and Lumps of Plate: So are their Ladys, when they are let Bloud, As if They had spent it, for their Cuntry's good. The Antient Romans tooke great Care To match, and Size, and pair Their Varlets, as we do a Coach horse or a mare; And were as Curious to see, Their Statures and their Cullers just agree, To fit the Black and brown and Sorrel haire And Critically Size Their Beards, their Noses, and their eies. As Probable as that of Guicciardine, Who at Bolognia write they sprung a Mine So great, and high, That those that were within By those without, might Perfectly be seene; And yet the wal fell in the same Place It stood before, and so dos, to our Days; Which makes some doubt how much a smoke of Powder Should be transparant to the Comon Souldier. Absurdities A Man of Stile, and Eloquence Although as far from wit and Sense As He that made a house deliver A long Oration to a River. As if the Devil to make Proof He's a clean Beast, should shew his Cloven-hoof. As Just as 'twas for Burning Paules To build it with excise on Coales. Made an Empty Noyse with words As Fencers stamp upon the Boards, To Daunt the Enemy with th' Sound But go's for nothing on the Ground. Mistake the Meanes for th' Ends of Life, And like the Prussian eate a knife. Swift as two Taylors Run a Race At sewing twenty Score of Lace. A Trible More silly then a Statesman Quibble. As Curiously as Paper wasts in Print When evry Page has weight, and measure In't. And when th' have cald them by another Name Perswade themselves th' are Really the Same. As Brisk and Frolique in a Smoking-shop As Swallows are upon a Chimnys-top. As Horses when th' are Spurd and prickd But kick again, for being kickd. All Cattle use, the shorter Their Commons are, to feed the Heartier. Custome Custom, that Fatal Epidemique Ach Which all mankinde of one another Catch As in the Alphabet; No Letters Take place of one another, as their Better[s] But only use and Custome makes th' As Of all their Equall Followers take Place. For nothing is so Infamous, and Shameful But may be vindicated by Example. Opinion Opinions held by Custome and Prescription As Legally as Reason and Conviction: As Greatest Nonsense serv's for Tearms of Art The Mysterys of Science to Impart; When, if th' had been agreed on, Hum, and Buz Had don the Feat as wel, or Mumpsimus: For Sense has less to do, with Tearms of Arts Then Spades with Diamonds, or Clubs with Hearts. For as a Noose, the more 'tis Puld Is wont to take the Faster hold, So his Opinions allwayes far'd, The more th' were Hammerd, grew more hard: For confidence is nere so strong As when 'tis Certainst in the wrong Folly Those that have to do with Fooles Must turn themselves t' as very owles. Sober Folly is the worst Of all Sorts, and the most Accurst. An Idiot is but an Almes at Court The King bestows on those that aske him for't. For Idiots (Anatomists Maintaine) Have no Commerce, between the Heart and Braine. For no exact and true Proposition Pleases The Ignorant, like Pretty uglinesses, That serv's to set an Edge on Fancy with As vineger and Sowr Fruit do's the teeth. No wonder Ignorance is Counted Holy, Credulity it self's the Nurse of Folly, Or (as some say) a medcine to anoynt And Ease the Torment of a Gouty Joynt, When most mens memorys are found so Dul They cannot think on Death without a Scul. A Mad man Seldom forfets al his wits Without some Intervals Between their Fits. Eternal talking's but an overheat O' th' Brain, as some put rume in Parrot's meat. Nonsense As By-blows having Right to more then one Presumptive father, Legally have none. For those that undertake to Teach, have less Then other men of that which they Profess; For commonly the greatest Folly's wont To be Cast up, and Placd to their account; And all the Freaks and madnes of a noddy Ascribd to nothing but th' excess of Study; As 'tis the Constant Nature of Excess In any thing to turn to a Diseas; As Monsters seldom have been found to Neede A Natural Limb, but Frequently t' exceed. Truth For Truth in Morals and Mythologies With its own weapons Passes upon Lys. What more Prodigious wonder can appeare Then Naked Truth would to a Princes Eare, Whose Interests and wills b'ing inconsistents Th' are by their Ministers kept at a Distance? For Truth and Princes are Antagonists, That only meet t' incounter in the lists, And both are sayd t' have made Confederacies With wine and women ? Allies: For Truth has always been a Friend to wine And Kings with women Natrally Combine. Reason is but the ? way to Truth, Which seldom has been understood in Youth, That think they have a greater Latitude Ore Tru and False then Travellers allowd, That Fancy Things are not to be Receivd Because th' are Tru, but as they are Believd. Physique There was a Doctor, That with Sturdy Paines, And many years vexation of his Braines: Believ'd H' had found-out, (As they call their Guesses,) An Universall Cure, for all Diseases; And now Durst challenge Death to do it's worst, And Meet him at more woepons, if it durst, Then ever Charletan, upon a wall, Did Post him up, to Play a Prize with all. And Rout him Easily, at all the Ills, With which the Coward clogs the weekly Bills: This b'ing Resolvd, He now began to count To what his Fees, would in a yeare Amount: And found 'em Rise (each Malady b'ing ceast One with another) rather with the Least Then Over-Rated, To a Sum more vast, Then all the Publique Thieverys could wast. Some times He thought of Building Hospitalls And setting-up his Name, upon the wals, Where those of all Professions, that had livd By Physique formerly, might be, Relievd. But then he Guest; That would but make them worse, And hinder some to take a Better Course. For those Endowments allways are Possest, By none but those, that have deservd the[m] Least; And therefore Rather Pitcht on Colledges Where Lazy Drones might Study Sleep and Ease And Dunces, that are Fit for nothing else Might loose their time, Industriously in Cels; But then He cald to minde, there are such Store Of those Already, that to Set up more, Where Greater Numbers Freely might Retreat, And take Degrees, to Loyter, sleep, and Eate; The Church, and State, in Time, might want Supplys Of Able Men to be Imployd, and Rise, And forcd to take in, tho against their Hearts, Men of Indiffrent Honesty and Parts. One Afternoone, His wife unsatisfyd With what her Share amounted, to Divide; Who had endowd her, with some slight Disease, To buy her Pins, and Trinquets, with her Fees: After a Feind and Counterfet Caress Of False, and Artificial Tendernes, She thought, at last to whedle, and Trepan Of some Maladies the Good old Man, And told him in a Childs Affected Tone, She must have more Diseases of her own; For those she had already would not bring The Money in; as tru as any thing. And therefore some small Gruntling must to adjust The Sum, b' allowd, Indeed, my Deare, it must, Altho my only Naming of a Sum Has made thee look a little Tiny-Grum; For when but two are Buryd in a week, It is not like that many should be sick. And when Diseases happen to fall short I am not like to fare the Better for't. What Times were Those! Had wee but had it then When evry week eight Thou[sa]nd Dyd, or Ten! And when we shal againe have such a Season, I see but little Hopes, we have, in Reason: And therefor, as I sayd, some Paultry Aile Must be Allowd for what is like to Fail. Quoth he! That Mad Extravagance, The Pique Of which your Sex Perpetuall is Sick, That Longs for what, was never meant, for Food: And Loath's as much the wholsom, and the Good: I finde is Proof against the Greatest Pow'r Of Medcine, though my universall Cure: Is still unsatisfid in some Defects And Faylings, of our Better Temperd Sex. And Still, The Expectation of Fruition Determines in as Vaine, and Idle wishing. Have I not Freely given thee the Meazles, With one as Rich and Hopeful a Disease else? Only to buy thee Pins, and to Defray The Charg of Trinkets, to be Thrown away? That b'ing cast-up, have been found-out to cleare (All Charges Born) Two Thousand Pounds a year. And is not that Eno[u]gh to beare Expences Of little Trifles and Impertinences? At this Rate Nothing's Able to hold out Untill, at last, thou Hast my Pox, and Gout. I thought (Quoth She) you had not been so Nice Of Little Beggerly Infirmities. At least if you consider who it was That made your Credit first and medcine Pass, When all the Dose of Ginger bread and Manna And Isinglas, were but a Pen'north ana, Or who it was, First supplyd your Tub With Jorny-work, and brought in many a Job, Helped you to Patient-makers, of the Trade That trusted you to take off all they made, Who payd your Rent? the Apothecary's Bribe? H' allows of Course to all that but Prescribe? That did not only Furnish the Disease, But had you Freely Payd your Bills, and Fees: When all your Busness was to talke of Symptomes, Tho but of Th' Itch, and Meazles, or the Grincomes. 'Tis tru Quoth he, this Little Shifting Course, We have been forcd to take t' avoyd a worse: And thou hast not been wanting for thy Part In all a woman's wit can do or Art, Nor must we wholly give it over, yet Whatever 'tis our luck to loose, or Get. It has by others frequently been don And wilbe so againe, when we are Gone, Which make's me Confident, The safest Shift And Easiest way to bee brought about is Thrift. Thou knowst the Charges of my House and Table Must needs grow more, and more, considerable, And much must be, in Projects that begin, Layd out at first for Drawing vouchers in. For when 'tis Nothing, but Discourse and Talke, Wee ought as much for all things else Defalke: And much in Reason is to be allowd For making New Designes (beforehand) good. Besides the vast Expences for Materialls, Of Dead Mens Bones embalmd before their Burials: Proportionable Hogs-heads of May-Dew, That are not Like to be Supplyd b' a Few. With Competent Allowance of the mixture, Of th' universal Spirit, The Elixer. And Sevrall Inches of the Long-streit-Line, To which such wonders Natrallists Assigne; With equal Doses of th' ossacrum-Luz, Th' Immortall Redeviver of the Jews. And Central Fire, that Persecutes the Species, Of Plants, and Minerals to the Superficies: With Astral Spirits, and Intelligences, All Probable to multiply Expences. With other strange Ingredients never known, And therefore Like to go the better down. But if our Medcine do but finde Success We shal not want for what supplys wee Please, For all Inventions Difficult and Hard Do seldom Miss a competent Reward. But if it should unluckyly miscary, Wee shal not want at least things Necessary. For tho we commonly set-up so soon, T'is Hard to Get in Practice, or be known: Until w' have long applyd t' Apothecarys, Nurse-keepers, Coffy-houses, Ordinarys, All Sorts of Greatmens Laquais, and valets, Only to Bayt our Hooks, and Spread our Nets; Are sometimes forcd to Practice in Compliance To others Humors, Things below the Science; Have Tricks to set Diseases Back, and Aches To Nicks of Idler times, Like Finger-watches, And Prorogations to give Present Ease, T' Adjorn, But not Recover a Disease, With other curious Arts enough to live In such Deare times, but not Grow Rich and thrive, Like that Physitian, who to get his fees, Kept Store of Cats, to furnish him with Fleas; That, when they bit the Ladys, Did him service, To Pass for Sharpnes of the Bloud, and Scurvies: Or He that held mens inward Fabrique lay To Justify Anatomy, one way, And that Mankind was made to none effect But only for a Surgeon to Dissect. As He that came up then, to fetch down whores To fill the Cuntry's Magazins with Stores And fill his empty, and exhausted stocks With fresh Recruits for Botches, and the Pox. And, when th' Infected Chare-women had don't, He curd their Manges on his own account And sent them up to follow their occasions And bring down New Recruits the next vacations. For when Physitians were from Rome expeld All sickly People, their Diseases heald With eating Cole-worts only, simply taken, Without the least Ingredient of Bacon. When Health is at it's Height, 'Tis Naturall It should Decline Immediately, and fall. So Rings made of the Bones of Hippocamps, Are Amulets against the Rage of Cramps. He that would Cure a wound, must have a Care, To keep it close, from taking of the Aire. The least and most Innocuous of Diseases, Is Desprater, the Nobler Part, it ceases. Has more wounds then the Man, i' th' Almanack Run through by all the Signs i' th' Zodiack. When evry Spot, produces but the Name, And Nothing else, of Plants, that are the same: And Fruit-trees have as great a Difference, In their Productions, to the Dullest Sense. Whence 'tis so hard to meet with an Ingredient That to our own Præscriptions, wilbe obedient. For when a Plant Degenerat's t' a weed, They freely Pass, in one another Stead, An Antient Composition, and a Fresh, Have æquall virtue, over a Disease: That 'tis Impossible, t' administer, To th' Itch, and Mange, with safety, and not Erre. Beside the Dangerous Gibberish of Pædants To learn the Bumbast-Names, of all Ingredients, That No Man is permitted to be Sick, But must be Cur'd, in Latin, or in Greek, For No Men love so Naturally to Dabble, As those that Pass for Learnedish, and Able. That can put down (in fustian) th' Ablest Brushers Of hinder Parts, Inculcaters, and ushers. So he that knew a Tayler, by his Stale, Because with shreds, H' had stopt the urinalle. And tho He understands no Medcines Name He Know's them all by Sight, and Common fame. And has so great opinion, of their Skill, That he Dares trust 'em, to Destroy, or kill. For those that Do no Hurt, at least, secure Their Patients, from the Desperatst Fit, the Cure. The Patient give's the Doctor, Half th' A[d]vice That He Return's, and for his Fee, Apply's. When he Informe's him, of the first Accesse And Symptomatique Freakes, of the Disease, And Lay's out nothing, but as weake Reflexions Upon the Sickmans Tru, or False Directions, But oft exchanges for some other Course When he Perceiv's himself grow worse, and worse. Who ever was a more frequented Doctor Then th' Antient Trig? or late Inceptor Lockier? Created out of nothing, but their own And all the Rabble's mandate, of the Town. And did their Exercices, with Chimeras Not much below the Sorbonists vesperys, That Post their Theses, on their Colledg-wals With great mens Pictures, t' own 'em, tru or false. A very visitant's an Operator, That strives with Flams to Practice upon Nature, Tells what a Friend of [his] had strangly sufferd In that Distemper, but was now Recoverd, Untill the Leech must be calld in, to Try Th' experiment, and virtu, of a Ly, Mean while the wretched Patient is set back And Desperater Infirmity o' th' Quack. For most Liefhebbers usuall Relapse Upon the News of other Men's Escapes. Especially, if the Medcines operation Have but a Hint, of Supererrogation Which, when it is cunningly Designd, and layd Bring's in a great Advantage, to the Trade. And those, that Practice it, Have found it yeilds More Patients, then Padua, or More-fields. That never Dub a Doctor, till he has Givn Caution, not to Practice on the Place. As wounds in the left Leg, tho ere so slight, Are Harder Cur'd, then Greater in the Right. Nature And as in Animals the smell Is plac'd by Nature Sentinell Upon the Mouth; To pass, or stay, All Aliments that go that way. As Pliny's Partridges are sayd to Tread Another Covey flying 'ore its Head. So Beares (some write) are whelpd with Staring eies As large as when they are at their largest cize, Altho at first no bigger then a Rat, Until they have been lickd up to their Height. Thunder the sole Artillery of Nature Is Fird with Cold, and chargd with Ice, and water. Thunder is Natures Demy-Canon-Piece Dischargd by a Cold Antiperistasis. It is in vain, and Ignorant to force What Nature do's beyond her Constant Course, That, when she's Idly over-chargd, Recoyles, And all that's meant T' impose upon her, Spoyles. The sea itself throws up the Beech and sand, To Keep it from Incroaching on the Land, And th' Amplest River's never wont to Rise Above the Level, where it's fountaine Lys. The smallest Parcel[s] of the universe To all the Rest o' th' world are Forrainers, To Human Nature and Mankind within The Species only Hardly are of kin. And what the one half's naturally for, All others as Impetuously abhor. For all the Ruggedst and most Desperat Of Storms at Sea, are in a narrow strait. A single Thumb can equal strength command To all the Fellow-fingers, of the Hand. So lions hunt conducted by Jackalls And little fishes steare the vastest whales. As men with little fishes, use to Bayt Their Hooks, and Lines to tempt and catch the great. Birds have but one Lid, to preserve their sight From taking Hurt, when upon trees they light. As in the Middle of a River, Tides Run Counter, to the Current of both Sides, Against the Streames of Chanels, take their Course, Where Th' are encounterd with the greater Force. The Sun drinks up the Bottom of the Seas Before the Top, because it is more Fresh: From whence it is the upper Superficies Is only usd to prey on ships by Fishes. Great Rivers th[r]ough as spacious Lakes wil Flow And never mix their waters, as they go. Tides do but Change the Natrall Al[t]itudes And Constant Elevation of the Fluds. As Gold and Silver's in the Basest Mine, But 'tis not worth the Charges to Refine. As Thistles satisfy an Ass And serve for Sallets to his Grass, Whose Rude, and undiscerning Pallate Is fit enough, for such a Sallet. As by Antipathy Eagyptian Rats When ere they meet, destroy and Strangle Cats. London's serv'd with Fire by water That both together serve all Nature. As sure as Tumbling of the sheets The Death of men in mortal fits. As violent windes when th' are most fleet In Motion, are affirmd to sit. As Natural as 'tis for Sots T' Admire Phantastique Idiots. Begotten by an Excrement And born to give ease and Vent. There is no Doubt of things that are Perpetual And in a Constant Course of Nature Settle. So all the Backs of Fishes are by Nature Dyd of the Native Culler of the water, But all their Bellys, like the Airy Light Of the upper Superficies, perfect white. Chymistry What wil not Pass for the Philosophers Stone? An Art that has no Language of it's own? But is all Canting: a Confounded mixture Of all things else, as Quintessence, Elixer, A Spirit, and a water, and will Passe For any other Thing, it never was. Magique The Irish never Pray a Cow or Horse, But Spit upon it Constantly of Course, To Keep it safe and sound against the Harms Of witches Conjurations and their Charms. For if the Devill Publiquely were known His Deeds of Darkness never could be don: And therefore 's Forc't to manage out of Sight, His Hidden Principality of Night. Whom evry Small Magician would Disarme, And send upon his Errands, with a Charme; And when his witches, are but ceizd upon, He gives them over, to be Hangd for None. And, tho H' was bid to get behinde by Christ, Is chargd T' Avant before, b' an Exorcist; That Bayts his Hook with Witches to Beguile, And take 'em for his Croney-Imps a while, That when the Time's expird, the false Deceiver May take 'em in his vassellage for ever. The Antients usd to Draw th' Eumenides, Th' Infernal Furys, in a Fœmall Dress. The Devill who was Hidden in a Barne, And Thrash'd unmercifully in the Corne: Durst take no Notice of the Blows, for Feare, Of being worse usd, if H' had been taken there. For Fooles are but Familiars to themselves; That serve the Cunning-men Instead of Elves: And all their Magicall Contrivances, Impose upon themselves, with greater ease. With Drams of Opiats, and Narcotique Doses, Intoxicate Besotted virtuosos, Make Nets for Sub[t]le vermine in the Aire Invisible as Snakes in vineger; That use, to fetch, and carry, all Diseases, And Spot Infected Bodys like Punaises; Preserve 'em Ready Bottled-up in Glasses, For all occasions, and Designes, and Places. And vent in Blasts of Poysond winde, Their Share of Mischief to Mankinde. Make Charms t' Inable Irish Ratcatchers T' Inchant and Poyson vermine with, in verse. And these are th' original Traditions Of th' Antient Incantations of Magitians And all their Magicall Infatuations But upstart Heresys, and Innovations. As Learnd as those Great Doctors of the Chair Among those Academiques of the Aire, That Offerd to Dispute with Cardans Father In Metaphysiques of the upper Æther; From whence he grew a Deep Philosopher As well as Mad man, and Astrologer, And by their Nearer N[e]ighborhood, with the moon Knew better, how those Mystique feats are don. Astrology How Planets in Conjunction, evry minute, Are Chopt, and Changd, yet Do their Busnes in it: While those, that since the worlds Originall Have been unfixt, yet never Could forestall. As 'tis Impertinent for cheats to fix Among the understanders of their Tricks But rather strive, To change the Aire, and stroule To catch the Ignorant, and unwary foule: Whence 'tis the Stars, that dwel in th' upper Æthers, Have all their Intrests, only in the Neather: And as their Influences are sayd by some To give us, what they never had at home So all their other operations, tend To as Ridiculous, and vaine an End: For there's no other work of Nature else But æqually th' Events of things foretels. As Monsters, that for nothing were Designd, With Omens, and Prædictions stock Mankind: And greatest Empires steard their Interests With Flights of Birds, and Garbages of Beasts, Or He that Future Earth-quakes Could foretell By Feeling Mud, i' th' Bottom of a wel, As true as Conjuring with Virgils verse, T' unriddle all mens fates, and Characters: For all the Stars Conjunctions, and Ecclipses Prædict but Picking-Pockets, worse then Gypsies. The Sun, and Moon, in Heaven, at so vast A Geometrique Distance, have been Plact That all their Different Dimensions, Here Do of a seeming Magnitude, appeare. Some make the Sun to th' under-Earth draw neare So many Scores of his Diameter, But cannot tell, If th' Antients Days, and Houres, Were of a lesse, or Greater Length, the[n] ours: But have no more Ground, then Astrologers, Have for their worms, and magots of the Stars. But have less Sense, for all they undertake Then all their Frenzys in the Zodiack. And if the Heavns be but one Constellation, As all to Any, have the same Relation, (Except those Few Erroneous Vagabonds, With which, The Earth, as falsly Corresponds) The whole to all the Rest may Freely clame An æquall Property, beside th[e] Name. The Best Astrologers are always made Of Crackt Mechaniques, of some other Trade. And when the Planets are Designd to Erre, How much more must the Dul Astrologer? When those, He is to be directed by, Are Namd from Fraud, Imposture, and a ly? And have their most Erroneous Santrings made, The Principles, and Basis of a Trade. For Tradesmen, and Mechaniques are the Primest And Best of all Astrologers and Chymists. Only the Devil is, yourselves aver, The most Profound, and Deep Astrologer: With whom no other, ever durst compare, For, as hee's Prince, and Sultan of the Aire: Without whose Licence, and Commission had, No Influences dare Presume to Trade, For 'tis but Labour thrown away, T' Incline Unless he give them, Special Quarentine: And Hee, who Perfectst understands their use, Do's æqually know where to Pick, and choose, Then whether you Apply yourselvs to him: This way, or any else; 'tis but a whim. For whores, and Hectors, when th' are Past Their Labour, and grown Old and Cast, Turn Naturally, as the Imps To other Harlots, Bawds, and Pimps. As those that buy a Salmon-draught Pay for the Fish, before 'tis Caught. Suppose a Figure Calculated, The Geniture exactly stated: Another of the Self-same Person With æqual care, and Animadversion By way of Horary-Inspection, Th' Effect, of this, or that Erection Must be the very same; or else The one, or both must need[s] be False. Or He that snapt the Guards of Jupiter, And listed them to serve the Emperor. When all the sevral ways of virtuosing Are but a formal Sort, of Dry Deboshing: Which made the A[n]tients Celebrat an Owle As th' only Proper Philosophique Foul. For witches are no sooner taken By their Treacherous Imps [forsaken], And when by Law, th' are ceasd upon Are only Hangd for being None. As Empson with the sivs he wrought, Could never finde his Fortune out. One Night the Sun far more obscures, Then all th' Ecclipses He Endure's. All Poynts of Heaven, are at Noone, As soon as Entred by the Sun. A Prophet has no need of Being wise When all his Art, in Dreams, and visions Ly's. And like a Second sighted Scot Could foresee, all the Heavens Plot. Did not Menippus mounted in the Moon, Discover all, that upon Earth was don? Or shee at th' Entrance of th' Ecclyps, foreshow The Macedonians Kings overthrow? And did not only make the Dire Portent But was the Real Cause of the Event. For th' Antient Romans, only by their Cuninge In our Profession, stoutly overrunne him. And if wee can th' Ecclyps it self foretell Why should wee not th' Event of it, as well? Love Love's but a Running of the Fancy, A Clap of fond extravagancy, That, if it be not stop'd in time, Break's out in Botches of vile Rhime: And when 'tis with Love-powder laden, And prim'd and Cock'd by miss or Madam, The smallest Sparkle of an eie Give's fire to his Artilery. Th' Arabian Goat Inragd and Furious turns When any other Beast has touchd his Horns. Some Love with Orenges, Boon Christians, And some with Lemon-Pils and Citrons. Loves Arrows are but shot at Rovers, Though all they hit they turn to Lovers, And all the Desprate Consequents Depend upon as Blinde events, As Gamsters, when they play a Set With greatest Cunning at Piquet, Put out with Caution, and take in They know not what, unsight-unseen. So Fairest Gamsters at the Banes Take paines, and Plod to win by chance, And study how to Draw a Prize With greatest Skil at Lotteries. Like Bucephalus Brutish Honor Would have none mount but the Right owner. As Ladys, not to see nor heare A Play, frequent the Theater, But to be seen, and tempt some Squire At a feigned Passion to take fire. When by the swelling of the Girdle The Lover findes his Soyl fertile. Welth is all these, she that has that Is any thing she would be at: Wit, Bewty, honor, virtu, vice Are always valu'd by the price; For what are lips, and eies, and Teeth Which Bewty fights and Conquers with, But Rubys, pearles and Diamonds, With which a Philter Love Compounds? Or what is Hair but threads of gold That Lovers Hearts in fetters hold? Your eies are not two Pretious Stones Nor twinkling Stars but radiant Suns, That Dazle those that looke upon yee And Scorch all other Ladys tawny. Your Shining Hair of the same Fleece is With that of Hev'nly Berenices; Your Lips no Rubys, but the Staine Of th' Hev'nly Dragons bloud in graine: Your Teeth not Pearles but whiter far Then those of th' heav'nly Dog-star. One who was still as warme with Love As a Dutch-vrister keeps her Stove, And weares in winter time between her thighs To keep her Dyke from freezing with Ice, But always fayld to hit his mark Unless it were in Whetstones Park, Where Lovers Arrows oft Rebound And those that shoot at Random wound. As Irish Lovers use to make Adress By Darting Rushes at their Mistresses, That do more Execution then the Darts And Bows and Arrows us'd to Conquer hearts. As Ladys of the Greatest Quality Make Love themselves to those of less degree. For Love, that is both man and Beast, Is equally with Both possest, And like a Pythagorean Soul, Run's through al Sort[s] of fish and Foul, Retaine's a Smack of evry one He shews his mighty Powr upon; And when so ere hee's mad and fond Has something of the vagabond. That in the Game of Ladys Hearts Know how to pack and Marke the Carts. What ere the Devil shee do's ayl This Bearers Spouse looke's very Pale, And, by the Culler of her Cheekes, Eate's cheese of Chalk and bread of Bricks. [I] know y' have Store of Remedies [For] maladys much worse then this; Then, pre'thee, looke among thy bookes [F]or something that wil Cure her lookes, [For] hee's asham'd to have it sed [He] has not had her Maydenhead; Though, to Confess the truth to you (Who are my friend), it is too true; For he is no such sturdy Porter T' indure a Woman made of Morter; For, if h' had venturd to have ? her, [He'd] be no Husband, but a Doctor; And he is loath to have his ? To save his Purse turn Emperique. Then, Prethee, thinke upon his Case, And give him something for her face; For while it looke's so like a Clout [It] will still be lent and wedding out. His face on which appeard no bristles But gentle as the Down of Thistles; But as those Thistles weare the softest down To hide their Prickles til th' are grown, So did that softnes do Lovs Darts Until it surprizd and piercd their tender hearts. That Bewty Nature give's to flowrs And sweetnes too is Dul to yours, And that bright Luster which she paints On Eastern Stones, grows dim and faints, More glorious then those she limnes On Tayles of Birds and Eastern Jems. That Relique must be most Divine That's kept in such a bewteous shrine. Marriage The ? spawn of Love and Feare That Haunt, and Hag the Marryd Paire And make them both Ride one another With Fits of th' Incubus, and Mother. Devourd by Great, and little Friends, Like Candles burning at both ends, The Insolence of Great Relations, And Petulance of mean, and Base ones. [Who] Would have hang t' have been possest Would do as much to be Releast. That with worldly Goods Indow each other, Claps, and Nodes, Until his Horns become the Theams Of Western-pug-wit on the Temes, The Everlasting Subject matter, Of Repartees, upon the water. Whence Lovers who had often been slighted For b'ing Adventurers, unknighted, As soone as once they have been Dubd Or else more honorably Tubd: Their Names in Blazon vamp'd with Sirs Have now the Damzels, and their Spurs. Make marriages a Greater Sin Without Degrees then those within; No wonder then th' are no more ty'd To Articles on either side, But rather use their Freedom more, And own it, then they Durst before: For those who take but one at once All others for the Time Renounce, And that's sufficient to perform Engagements only made for Form, And, if at Certaine times th' are free, 'Tis at their Choyce when they shalbe. Who Henpeck none to that Degree As Grave men in Authority, And still the more th' are great and Rich The more they Hug, the Dear Caprich. For whores of Hectors get the Pox As Pullets have been clapd by Rooks. Turn's her gentle Soft Compliance To Endless Quarrels and Defyance. That would not sel his Liberty His ease and Quietness to Buy. Marryd a Crossgraind Lady, more Ill Naturd Then Malice (in the Letany) and Hatred. A man that like a By-blow, and his mother, Were æqually ashamed of one another. Especially, so great a Son o' th' Church, Th' h' was thought to be begotten in the Porch. Women So Homer stole his wars of Troy, and Greece, In Ægypt, from a Spinster Poetesse. A Lady with Top-gallant Fowr And Busk behind her and before, Relict of all those virtuosos Disceasd of French Stoccades in Nose, Or all those Hospitaler-knight[s] Disceasd of wounds in single fights. Make Nature operate out of Season Or women to submit to Reason. As easy as a Lady Buxome Dos make a Cully of a Coxcomb. Lust Had got a Grant for al the Bodys Of Gossips, Gammers, Dames, and Goodies, And by Abolishing the Notion Of Chastity, Prevent Deboshing. Who[se] Forehead spread as Lazy and Full As his wh' was Got and Horn'd b' a Bull. That do their work in Hugger mugger As Cautiously as Pædants Bugger. And Swathd together by a Surgeon As Feeble as a kick of Sturgeon. As Common as it is for Misses To Pass with Revrend men for Neeces. The Jews that by their Laws allow An ox to Thrash as well as Plow. Honor How many Sinners Dissolute, and Common, By Cuntry Squires made Honest Gentlewomen? And won, and wedded out of Puddle-Dock To Eldest Sons and Heirs of Antient Stock. When Having in the Quality of Neeces Servd out the best of all their time, for Misses. By uncles, or Imaginary Cusses Have been put off to worshipfullest Houses. B' Adopted Uncles, have been past for Spouses To Worshipfull, or Honorable Houses. That's puft up with his own conceipt, and swels With vanity, and Pride, and nothing else, Like empty Bladders, i' th' Pneumatique Engine, Blown up with nothing; but their own extension; Whose Titles, like French Noble Mens Degres Are but distinguisht by their Gallowses, Where those that on Most Numerous Pillers stand Take Place of Monsiers of the Greatst Command, And he['s] the Richest Person, that is full Of most work for his stallion-Horse or Bull. When he that by the Crop, lets out t' his Tenants, His Land, and ovens, has the greatst convenience. As one Descended of the Empereres Of th' East; In Rome, sold lately all Th' Arriers And Tittles in Remainder, of the Honors The Turk usurp's still, from the Legall owners. For t' hang ones self is counted No Disgrace, But to be hangd, by others, vile, and Base. And when the Sottish Ignorant extold him, Found Human Nature was too weak to hold him. For Puft-up Greatness has a Speciall Care Before its Haughty Selfe, of standing Bare: Is his own Betters, and not Proudly sufferd Among Inferior Persons to bee Coverd, But like an Usher, is obligd to stand Before himself with awful hat in Hand And by his own Respect, t' himself, invite His lesser Visitants to do him Right. Least others freely should Presume to do, The same things, in his Pers'nal Presence too. But by his own Example take occasion, To Imitate his ways of Application. For Haughty Greatnes must not stoop so low As those that only serve to make it so: Must turn it's careless Back to all Inferiors And proudly look before upon Superiors. Approchd with Distant aw and Reverence As terrible as Plague, or Pestilence, But no man Introducd without a fine Untill h' has wayted out his Quarentine. For Saints noe other votaries Receive Untill th' have watchd and wayted out their Eave. And Lay for't most Religiously, before They can be freely Admitted to Adore; And when they are, An Insolent vouchsafe Is all the Favour they can hope to have. So the Great Cham proclame to the Grand Signor When he has din'd free leave to go to Dinner. Put of[f] His Hat, and Bowd, and made Addresses, And Boun Professes, to his Footmans Sneezes. Grew Proud, tho of the wretchedst Priviledge, To Ride to execution on a sledge, To shew his Rank, while those of less Deserts, Are only alowd to be conveyd in Carts: Tho he Disparagd, and Contemnd them for't, As born t' an æquall Penance through the Durt, While He was Drawn more Easily, and Cleane, To shew the Diffrence of the great, and meane. The World As Diamonds of Ordinary weight, For evry Caract, beare a Certaine Rate, But, when they once outgrow the Common Size, The least Addition multiplys the Price. 'Tis easier to Counterfet a Stone Of any Dy, then Diamonds of None. As 'tis more gallant to command Then to be able to know how, So 'tis to Censure then to know, And to Controll then understand. For knowledge is a thing below, And 'tis more noble to appeare Above it, without Charge or Paines Or the Dul Industry of Braines, Then earne it at a Rate so deare: For as all People would be rich, But Fortune only ha's the Power Or Industry to appoint which, And makes some Poore Only t' advance the other more, Soe all men would be wise and know, Though Nature only orders who Shalbe and shal ne're be so. Devour's his Fortune in a Trice And eates himself like Adam out of Paradice. The Magique of Mens Native Soyles Though 'ere so Homely, stil Prevailes To make them rather Settle there Then ? better any where. And 'ere they dy would faine Return To be buryd, where th' were Born. When that which Order's all the matter Is th' High and mighty Powr of Nature; Nature the Universal Sovraine And Custom her Colleague, that Govern. He that's Drunkest Is in the Fairest way of Conquest. The world for other Sins was drownd Before the use of wine was found, When Fishes that by Drinking Live Were only worthy a Reprive. The smooth fac'd youth freed from his Tutors care Loves Dogs and horses and the Chirgeon Aire, Prone to debauch, but obstinate t' advice, Regardles how his time and money flys. Our Sighs and Feares give no relief To them at al but our own grief. So when the unwise are Powr shun Into the Contrary they run. And as in Ships of war we do not State Their greatnes from their Burden or their Rate, Nor as in Merchantmen count by their Tuns But by the men she carrys and the Guns, So he, that would know her Proportion just, Must reckon by her mischief and her Lust. Vulgarity That went to Heaven in a slip As Seamen swing from ship to ship, And might have been for just desert Raysd from the Dongeon to the Cart, And after Risen step by step, Untill he fetched a higher leap, And swung to New worlds by the Neck, As sea men do from Deck to Deck. Morality A man may be a foole with sense As well as mad with Patience. Punishment[s] do not grow less But rather by Delays increase; For all they by Forbearance gain Do's only aggravate the Pain. A Man that swell Pride and Fat, Like the Scotch Minister of State. Who when they are Intrap't and Caught Are but possest of what they sought; And if they like the Artifice They need not quarrell at the Price. The Spider do's not seek the Fly, But leave's him, of himself t' apply, Nor do's the Trap pursue the Mice, But freely they themselves surprise. Avarice As Poorest Beggers are the Best And those the wretchedst that want lest. And those who venture to climb high In th' Air, for want of Aire dy, As men on Tenarif are se'd For want of Aire to fall down dead. To whom no Honey combe nor Sugar Was ere so sweet as filthy Lucre. To nothing tru in no Condition But filthy Lucre and Ambition, And, like a Greedy Cormorant, Devouring but increast his want; Knew all the Secret ways t' amasse, And drove more Trades with Publique Cash Then all the Scribes and Publicans In Princes Customs and Divans. So greedy and Insatiable He layd on Right and wrong a Gabel. Fortune Our Fortunes now are such, Remorse Can never mend but make it worse, And 'tis Below the worst of Fooling To think to Help it by Condoling, To spend our little Time and thoughts In Quarreling and finding Faults: For None are wretcheder undon Then those Condemnd to wayl and mone. Wealth Why should not wit as wel as wealth Be raysd by Forgery and Stealth? Vice One who had no Leisure Between his Bus'nes, and his Pleasure To think of any thing but what To th' one, or th' other did relate. ? Could carry on his Load Like Mules that travel in a Road And understand which way to take As well asleep as broad awake. A Prodigal nere fayles to hate Those who have purchacd his Estate, Although at ere so great a Rate; Is safer trusted with untold Cabals and Secrets, then with Gold. Begotten as great Princes wed By Proxy in his Fathers stead. One that was Peevisher and testier Then Botches when they Rage and fester; Revenge, and Mischief, and Despight Were both his Bus'nes, and Delight. Though Squemish in her Outward woman As Lewd, and Rampant as Dol Common. Poetry This may be don by those that shall come after, But no Age wil indure its own Satyr. There has been such a glut of Plays of late The Plenty of them ha's brought down the Rate. Prologue If I could hope you would not tell agen, Fayr Ladys and most worthy Gentlemen, I've something to say t' yee; but am afeard I should, by some within, be overheard: In brief 'tis only this, wee have within Two Poets such as yet were never seen: One is a writer, and of great Renown, But by an envious Faction now kept down, And yet in this new Play he has thought [fit] To entertaine a Partner of his wit, One that did never write, yet understands How to put of[f] what Ly's on th' others hands, And now th' are setting up with a Joynt ? To deal for what you at the Dores have payd, Like Indian Merchants, that, for Beads and Trinkets, Make rich Returnes of Orient Pearls and Ingots. I wish they may do so; but how so ere We are securd, and run no hazzard here: They have insur'd us against al mishap, You shalbe pleasd, and cry it up, and clap. W' have let 'em but our house, the Cloaths, and paines, And have no venture in their loss, or gaines. Then, whether you do Cry it up, or down, The gaine or loss is sure to be their own. A man may be a Poet that nere writ, As some that cannot read set up for wit; Critiques no doubt, that might impartial seeme, If good and bad were but alike to them. But they, out of a Bravery of minde, Are always to the weaker side inclin'd, As Courts of Justice use: else right and wrong Would not be able to hold out so long. And such a Court are some of you that sit By your half-Crown-Commissions in the Pit. To Judg, according as your Talents are, Between the King and Prisner at the Barre. But, as some Judges, whether wrong or right, Are found, in hanging men, to take Delight, A Poets ruine gives you more content Then Fals of Great men in the Government, Though you gaine nothing by 't: For seldome comes A Better (say's the Proverb) in their Roomes. For Poetry, like other Heresies, By being persecuted multiply's, And, the more wickedly some authors write, Others to write worse are encouragd by't. Thus, whether you do cry Plays up or downe, The Thing is found in th' end to be al one, And the best way is to let both alone; For, should they leave the Trade, they would get more Then ere they did by dealing in't before: For some are made by being crackd, as wel As Birds are hatchd by breaking of the Shel. He has observd there's but one certaine way To please you al, in writing of a Play, And that's by Scribling such a Paultry one Of Purpose as you'r surest to cry down: For then you have your wishes to the height And al you're wont to hope from those that write; Which is uncharitable and severe To those that have so hard a Province here. For what in England can a Poet hope, Though one of late beyond Sea is turnd Pope, In spight of Robert Wisdom, and some feare The rest o' th' Tribe wil fare the worst for 't here. As Birds and Beast[s] of Rapine heretofore Had their Heads payd for at the Churches Dore, So Poets have at ours: and if you were As Just in al your other Censures here, You were brave Judges, for to steal and prey On Others wits is now to write a Play, That's like a Cuckolds Child, no man can gather By any Feature of it who's the father, But, as in China when a Child is born The Man lies in for't in the womans turne, So when a woman do's but write a Play Some male-wit fathers it and ha's a day: Hence 'tis that while such Numbers strive to write, So few among them honestly come by't. For few bring any thing here of their own, But, like a Case in Law by Counsel drawn, Put in, and out, b' advice before it pas, Til 'tis another thing from what it was, Or else 'tis stollen out of Pedlers French That is French wit: while you upon the bench Allow it and beleive the Author made it, Because he did not tel you where he had it. Those rob the State of wit, and have undon yee, Like those that have to do with publique money, That, in their bottomless and hel-like purses, Store up the Peoples money and their Curses. He do's not write to gaine Applaus or Fame And therefore that way cannot miss his Ayme. Has taken of[f] the Quibble and the Rimes To make it fit the fashion of the Times. For, as a Durty Pond is aptest For Launching of an Anabaptist, So Durty Fopprys are most fit For those of Durty braines, and wit. For Poets are more rayld at then the Gods Or Stars by Lovers when they fal at ods. That swel and looke as Big, as if th' had payd An Empire for each Comedy they made, As once a Learned Critique but to own An old Song, swore he freely would have don. Plato, thinking to exile All Poets from his Sancho's Isle, Unwittingly expeld himself His own Poetique Commonwelth, With all his Sect of Followers, Mere Poets, only bating verse. Government The Sun ecclips'd in water best appeares, So should the fall of Kings be seen in Teares. What has this Government don more Then what the other did Before? When State, Religion, and the Laws, Have all espousd the Good old Cause. The selfsame Ministers imployd, That were before on th' other side: And all that has been Past, and don Is but the same Continud on. Raysd to preferment in the State Like False Scale, for want of weight. Mighty monarchs, are exprest In visions by some horned Beast. A Government so silly and perverse Is only fit to be destroyd by Beasts. For what can hold, when truth, and kings And wine, and women Rout all things? 'Tis Desperate to trust th' Advice And Pardond Faith of Enemies, Who use t' accompt the Grace and Favor But binding to the good Behavior: For there's no Livery, no Ceasin, Nor Fines in alienating Treason, Nor Bonds, but merely at Discretion One Minute to secure Possession, Who thinke they have the greatest wrong Because they are but half-unhung And only listed for the Gallows Against the next mischance that Follows; Which they believe has rather earnd Revenge, then Fayth to be returnd; And those that have venturd and came of[f] Long most to make a Second Proof. False Designes require more Care In Management then Just and fair. As Princes Favorite, when th' are Boys, For all his Faults by Proxy pays, So in Miscarriages of State, The Favorite is sure to pay't. When once a Princes wil meetes with restraint His Pow'r is then esteem'd but his Complaint. That meet not to consult, but Snap And th' Adverse Interest intrap To snatch all small Advantages As if they Playd a Game at Ches. More subtle at unriddling Cabals Then Foxes are in Æsop's Fables At over-reaching other Beast[s] And Jugling with their Interests. Nothing sinks so soon as Empires Upheld by Feeble Crazy Tempers. Bees are Governd in a Monarchy, But 'tis some more noble Femal Bee; For Femals never grow Effeminate As men Prove often, and subvert a State: For as they take to Men, and men to them It is the safest in the worst extreame. The Gracchi were most Resolute and stout Who only by their Mother had been taught. And though he livd a Beast and Sot That still his word, and Faith forgot: And nere was, till he came to Dy, In Perfect minde and Memory; To make his will, in which He gave Profusely, what He could not save: As first his Soul to his Creator, But nere Considerd the maine Matter; Whether 'twere Just He should Receive A thing he did not give, but Leave, Which He so Carelessly Had Kept, The Devill hardly would accept. As those, who by the Law o' th' Land, Are Sentencd to be burnt i' th' Hand: Give thanks upon their Bended knees, For Having th' honor of th' Imprese. That have more Politique Intrigues In Poynts, and Knots, and Periwigs, Then Statesmen have in breaking Leagues. Law For how can a Lawyer though 'ere so infirm Have Leasure to dy in the midst of a Tearm? That poore Rogues fate and thine are one, Who being ready to bee hangd Behold's the worke himself had don, The Hemp he has so often bangd; And when hee's dead wil hang in th' a[i]re As sure as Mahomet's Sepulcher. Laws to their Executions Prefer At best but th' Executioner. For when a Nation is a Slave, What Crowns of Monarchs can be safe? And still the less we wast our Right W' Injoy the greater Freedom by't. For Constant Right's The Tru streit Line To which such wonders some Assigne, For Forfeiture in Law, or Reputation Is Irrevocable as Privation, From which it is as much Impossible To be Redeemd, as Souls that are in Hel. As, in Utopia, Judges Hands Are burnt for taking Bribes, with Brands, To give the Court, and Hangman Reall Security under Hand, and Seal. That use t' ingage Both Houses, in Contest Against the Nations Publique Interest; Trot up, and Down, the Hall, to meet, and Heard, And cast up what Course next is to be steard. Make Publique Tests to Sweare to, ex Officio With many [a] subtle Politique Proviso, T' establish Perjurers, that can forsweare, And Honest Men, that cannot do 't, cashiere; All urgent Busnes of the House Abridge To nothinge else but breach of Priviledg. Admit the Important, and the Necessary No nearer minding then Præliminary And vote the Sessions, more Compendious To be against the Orders of the House. Th' expences of Dividing what th' had gaind Had Run the Publique money behind Hand, That Rapine, Sacriledge, and Providence, Could not Supply th' extravagant Expence; Nor turning all the Churches of the Nation Into one singular Impropriation: Nor Sale, nor Sequestration, could suffice; Nor Decimation, forfiture, Excise, Nor Selling Scots, by th' Head, our Pretious Brethren, To stock Plantations, 'mong the Indian Heathen. That Prayd, and taught, and Fasted to Devour With more Insatiate Greediness, and Powr, And Run through all the Difficultst Affairs Upon th' Account of Zeal, and Fasts, and Prayers, And by their owne self-seeking of the Lord Gave Revelations as Designs concurd, Destroyd Religion by Humiliations And strove to sow, and Sprinkle down three Nations. For Laws and Money are the same, And from the selfsame Derivation Came. As Daughters pass for Sons, in Legal Authors But not all Sons Indiffrently for Daughters. As in Sealing writings, He allone That take's the seal off, 's held to Put it on. Are held of Bums the bravest fellows, The Hangmans Life-guard at the Gallows, Without whose Ayd, the Populace Would hang him up, in his own Place. As equal Jurys use to Hang one Half Of Criminals, and th' other moeity save. As sinners in the Church of Rome do trust To be savd by the Suffrings of the Just. A Pirat do's more mischief of himself Then all together Storm, and Rock and shelf. When He, whose Present Turn it is to Read, Do's both their Talents, and their Bodys, feede, Expounds upon all Diffrent Sorts of Meates, And on, at least, five Hundred Dishes treates, Resolv's the Case in Law, the Poynt, and Reason, Of ven'son, Fish, and Foul, that are in Season: And with a most Judicious Tast, Defines, And states the Cases, of all Sorts of wines: And all his welcome Hearers Edifys With Hammes of Bacon, Tongues, and Red-Dear-Pies. Treachery A Man as Virtuous and Good As ever in a Galley Rowd. Discover Secrets but in whispers For th' Easy Credulous to Disperse. Whose words and Deeds are Counterfet And like a Printers letters set, Are not to be interpreted Unles by being Backward read. As Hangmen aske Delinquent Mercy And truss 'em up with wondrous Curtsy. No Jew ever had more Care To do his Busnes neat and fair And not like Judas, who betrayd So like a Bungler, and Delayd But was more Civil in his way And never let his Master stay. Like Rookes that use to drive subtle Trade By taking all the Odses that are Layd, And who so ever hap's to have the Best Are sure to win, or save themselvs at Least. But strive's t' assert a Supererrogation Of Inhumanity, and Profanation, Disdains to tread in any Beaten Path Of Vulgar Treachery, and Breach of Faith, But findes new ways, as some have don of Lechery The Sponsors and the Collarys of Treachery, Take's naturally to all Expedients Of the great work, to ruine Government; For those that have been hangd, and Cut in Quarters For Treachery are but the Devils Martyrs, Had servd in all Perfidiousnes, between The Legal years of Sixty and Sixteen. Injustice Was falser then the Mercury He trust's to, in his hollow Dy. There was no Gouty Politique Of which he could [not] streit be sick And wel again with equal Speed As with his Bus'nes best agreed. Look'd as Politique and shrewd as His antique Predecessor Judas, For those that make, no more keep Oaths Then Taylors make and weare al Cloaths. War For what but Risings was the Stubborn war Between the Clans of York and Lancaster? He thought no Stratagem so warlike As ceazing Danger by the Forelock, Nor any martial Disingagments So honorable as Detachments. He knew the force of woman Conduct By h[i]s Cuntry woman bold Queen Bonduc, And what H' had found himself by proof And therefore Soldierlike drew of[f] Surprizd him in his new Redout Without a Sentinel or Scout. Glory gaind by fighting's little Unless it be in Stealing Vittle. Hope That use to magnify in Microscopes All that concern's their Losses, or their Hopes. That some times Pass for greater, sometimes lesser, According as they happen to take Measure. Feare Feare keepes all other Passions out As Lesser Pains decline the Gout. There neede's no other Conjurer To Raise all Sorts of Fiends, but Feare, That give the Enemy no quarter When 'tis upon it's last Departure. Courage Mens Courage is not Limited, between The Periods, of Sixty and Sixteen; In which The yonge, are Entred in the List, And when th' have servd so many years, Dismist: The only Trade that men begin so yongue, To serve a Prentiship, that lasts so longe. Life may be boldly taken from Superiors, But never Given, but to mean Inferiors. Some warlike Nations have Receipts for Courage, By seasoning, with Gunpowder, their Porrige, That Renderd Cowards Bold, as if th' had layd The Devill, in the Pummel of a Blade. That in the Fortresses, upon their Backs Instead of Belts weare mighty Zodiacks, In which they Paltry little Cutlaus ty Like th' Antique Cabales in a Needles eie; That out of Politiques, make Choyce of those As Proprest Engines to Encounter Fo's, That, if their Courage should (by Chance) miscarry Against too Confident an Adversary, Th' excuse of all the Feat of Armes ly I' th' feeble weapons Imbecility. Religion As Confounding Languages Forerun The Fall and slavery of Babilon, So Canting brought the thorow-Reformation T' inslave and over-run the English Nation. All this is Right—but 'tis a Fiction To pass the Trick upon Conviction, Or put it on th' Accompt of Conscience Or opend eies,—a Flam, and Nonsense: 'Tis Temper make's a Renegado, To which Conviction's but a Shadow. Their Perilous Designes upon Hierusalem and Babilon, Which, being faythfully expounded, Meant only Cavalliere and Roundhead, Two Names the Rabble understood Both went by in the word of God. T' assume the Cause like th' old Croysado, And weare it only for a Shadow, Set up above all Ordinances, But only those of Dreames, and Traunses, As if the Powr of Godlines Were but a Lunatique Disease, And all New-lights but meare Effects Of th' Incubus, and Apoplex. Despise the Common-Prayer, as vaine And Superstitius, and Profane, Because they meet with no Occasions To shew by reading Dispensations, And ablest Saint[s] can make no shifts To hold forth, the meanest of their gifts. What was once but mere pretence Is now made good by Providence. All Miracles of Furthest Places ceast, And wonders of the Revealation-Beast: Whose Feats, that had so long, and oft appeard, The Joy, and Admiration of the Heard: And had a Magique Influence to win, And whistle all the Long-ear'd Rabble in. Had been so many yeares, in Publique shown That now they were grown out of Date, and known. And brought to a Generall Nauseous lothing, Men would not see, not heare of them for nothing: The Heavy'st Blockheads Scornd, and over-reacht, Th' Impertinent Designes, they Prayd and Preac[h]t. All Characters of either Good, or evill, That walkd in utter Darknes, like the Devill: Or usd to lurke in one anothers shapes, Broke out in Murthers, Thieverys, and Rapes: And that which had before been understood, For Good, Prov'd Bad, but seldom Bad the Good. As Evill Spirits, have been, in Adust, Black Choler, sayd, to find a Tempting Gust (From whence their own Familiar-Imps, like Leaches Are Nursd, and Suckled, at the Teats of witches) So crazd Phanatiques make The Just, and Good, Take Pleasure in their Bishops-footed Bloud: And from their Foul unwholsom Constitutions, Derive their Spiritual Graces, and Infusions. A Mungrel-Breed of Men, as Cross, and Aukerd, As those that were Producd, by Stones cast Backward: Or Evangelique Myrmidons, turnd Saints, From Busy, and Pragmatique swarms of Ants: That strive to cheat their Publique Interests, As Rookes to Pilfer one anothers Nests. So Oliver, when he had sought the Lord, But was affeard to give him back his word, Had Dund his Privy Counsellers to Dun him, To take the Crown, and Royalty upon him. Had Forgd him selfe an Answer, and Subornd, His Pack of Seers, what should be Returnd: But durst not undertake it, for his Eares, And upstart Saints, as wel as Cavalliers. 'Tis now the most Impertinent, and vaine, Of all the Hopes we once had, to Complaine. And no less Mad, to Dream awake of Force, As long as all the British world Concur's: When those we freely Made, the supreme Powrs, The English Nation, have Disposd of ours Impossible, by us, to be Restord; By Acting Politiquely, above Boord, But by the craftier Intrieges of State, T' Impose, and Juggle, and Insinuate: The Devils Dark Georgiques, which some write, He Practices, to sow his Tares by Night Heapes-up, and Spreads his Dong, on Barren Soyles, To bring up Plenteous weeds of New Turmoyles: To make us, undertake, to Prog, and Tamper: Between the Hall below, and Painted Chamber: For who but we alone, are Fit, and Able, To Manage so Mysterious a Cabal? Have Gifts, and Dispensations Necessary, Such wonderful out-goingses to Carry? Wee who have been bred-up, and Edifyd To steare Designes of Providence, and Guide: Have Powr to Rais them, for the Causes service, Supplys of Mony, Able men, and Purveyse; It is but only shifting of the Scene For th' Antient Actors, to come in agen: The Plot, Designe, and Actors, are the same Persue the self-same Argument, and aime: When all the Church Preferments in the Nation, Are but one Generall Impropriation. Which tho w' Indeavor to Inlarge, and Stretch Wil never, to our Hopes, and Projects reach: Altho w' have Bred-up all our Ablest Pupils In all the Curiositys of Scruples: To know why Horrid Crimes are swallod easy And little Faylings Difficult, and Queasy: The sevrall Methods of Improving Scismes, Upon the Least, and Slightest Criticisms: As those that could not beare with Bays, and Rings Made nothing of the Heads, and Bloud of Kings. 'Twil serve to make our Former Doctrine good, The Covenant can never be withstood: Nor any Powr on Earth prevayl against The soveraine Right, and Intrest of the Saints; Who Human Nature æqually Improve, By vice below, as wel, as Grace above: And carry all their Actions, closer then The Good or Bad of other Pious Men. For when Religion's settled in a state 'Tis nothing, but a Church Incorporate, In which, both Saints, and Sinners are inrould, And all their Gifts by æqual Charter Hold: A spiritual Rabble, where the Bad, and Good, Are undistinguisht Priviledge allowd; And when 'tis Renderd Uniforme, is made, And Regulated only like a Trade; Designd for Natural, and Carnal Ends, And not Religious unity of Friends: So all our zealous taking Parts, and Siding At first grew out of Nothing, but Dividing: And all our Prizes, Playd at Fasts, and Prayer, And Holding-forth, but New Designs, to share; When Saltmarsh, Sedgwick, Arrowsmith, and Jenkins Had Jealous Eies of one anothers Sinkings And evry Pretious, and Enlightend Brother, Suspected th' over-Earnings of another: 'Twas only sharing of our Dividends That first of all, Divided Saints, and Friends Untill they turnd to Sects, that had their Being From mutual Jealousy, and Disagreeing. Did nothing but from others Lights Dissent, As stubbornly as Laws and Government. When all their Saints, for virtu, and Religion, Might have been Chaplains to the Devil Legion: And when the Independent Disciplin Had turnd us out, and brought their own tribe in: The Good old Cause became another thing, To make their Patriarch Oliver a King: Which those that had been most Imployd upon, Obstructed all, that others would have don; Provd Brethren of a Negative Profession, With Independent Consciences, and Reason. Tho No men else Free wil so much Disown, And what th' are most Devoted to, Cry down: Had rather suffer all the Despratst Ills, Then to be Debard the wretchedst of their will: And when wee by th' Immutable Decres Of Providence, can Sentence whom we Please, They gave themselvs, a voluntary warrant, Of æqual Powr, to execute before hand: Enabled both the one, and th' other Saint Like Æacus, in Hell, and Rhadamant; As both a Judge to Destiny, and Sherife T' Arraine, Condemn, and hang-up or Reprieve: That servd for Partys, witnesses, and Jurys, And Executioners to all the Furys. And scornd as much In Spirituals t' obey, As in Profane Ingagements, but for Pay. Were wont the Christian Faith t' adulterate, With Jewish Principles of Church and State, And cobbled a Religion up, that's neither, The New, nor Old, but forgd of both together, Made Peacefull Precepts o' th' New testament, For Rapine, Bloud, and war, as Pertinent As Orthodox, and Apostolique Hold As all the Desolations of the old For since both æqually wee, Scripture name, In all things else they ought to be the same. A Levits Concubine, that Nation stood In more Distruction, Massacres, and Bloud Then Greece, and Troy did either give, or take, In ten yeares time, for Bewteous Hellens sake: And, if they were so lavish of their Bloud, Why should the Saints less Freedom be allowd? Especi[a]lly that have so great a Stake, Deposited for what they undertake? Which makes some other Zealots, to Proscribe And worry all, that are not of their Tribe: Omit no time t' Increase, and Propagate The mutual correspondences, of Hate: For no wars else, of Turks, and Renegados, Were ever so Inhuman, as Croysados. That Breaking Ground Accompt as th' only Course, Of taking in the Gates of Heavn, by Force: Or working in a Strong fortification, The very same with working-out Salvation; And therefore spends his Longs, and melts his Greace, In Picking Quarrels with the Publique Peace: And where there was no kinde of Government, About Absurd Dividing it Dissent; For no seard Conscience ever was so fell As that, which has been burnt with zeal. At conventicle Dutys, do's but say His more then Houres Canonique, and not Pray. Who censure, and condemne the Papist[s] for't, Because they do the same thing, but more short; That Bear's up Confidently, by mere force Of Ignorance, against his Governors, Indures no Power on Earth to be supreme, As Empty Boates sayl best against the Streame. For Nonsense being neither False nor true, A little wit to any thing, may Screw! Tell all the sottish Tales of Former Clergies And lay 'em only to the Moderns Charges That make the Independent-Church Metropolis, Of all their Simoniacall Monopolys: And forcd the Brethren to conforme to one, That in their Hearts, and Principles had none. But like the Antient Sanctum of the Jews, Held nothing else, but Lumber, and old shoos! And since Christ, when he was to be betrayd, Appeard Impatient of his b'ing Delayd He is more civil, when it lights in's way, And has a Special care he should not stay. For as the Turkish Sultan makes his Farms, To beare him Mighty Crops of Men at Armes: And evry Cuntry Messuage, and Timar, Instead of Beasts to breed him Men of war. So where the Brethren Are Impourd, They turn To Bloud, and Massacres, the whole Concern: And make all Cuntrys serve for Nurserys, To furnish Desolation, with Supplys: And tender Consciences, are always found Of such Recruits, to bee the Richest Grounde. For the Religion, when it wages war It go's against its Native Character, Yet nothing has a greater Powr to further Their out-ward men, then Sacriledg and murther. And as their Interests agree, or Differ, Make evry man a Saint, or unbeliever. That leave the Church, their Hives, like Swarms of Bees, To build in Rotten Holes, or Hollow Trees. Zeal Proselyts are stil most Real And busy with their smattring zeal, Like other Thievs, that Before Christmas Steal To keep the Holy Feast with Greater Zeal. Cruelty Who Taunted with a Silly Flurt Buryd alive an Army for't. Conscience The Tongue of Conscience is no slander, For, though it call a great Commander Pultron and Coward to his face, He nere considers what he says. Prelates Who since they Could not make a Priest a Prince, Have made them Convertible ever since; And, by Inferring a supposd mixt Person, Maintain the proud sophistical Conversion, By which all Truth and Reason's Sacrifict To th' Arbitrary Intrest of a Priest. Popery As Proper as Figleaves did Suite With Eating of Forbidden Fruite. The Catholique Religion, for the Souls Good, Make's no Distinction between Truth, and Falshood And as they use to falsify a Blow 'Tis all their Art to pass upon the Fo. Infallible as the Pope made Henry th' Eighth Defender of his Signory of Faith, Who in a few months Provd a brave Defendant And did his uttermost [to make] an End on't. As Naturally as a Jesuite To th' Gallows turn's a Zealous Proselyte. As Fewest Popes, and Cardinals, and Priests Of al Saints else, are in the Churches Lists: And more Consecrated women, then The Rubrique can Produce of Sainted men. For Pasquil and Morphorius are the Sum Of all th' Apostles modern Acts in Rome. As Barbers in the Church of Rome Degrade Or shave a Priest int' Orders by his Trade. As Papists cannot Pray to Saints, unless Th' are Prompted to it by their Images, Forget th' are in the Number of Mankinde Unless th' are by a Deads head put in minde. Trade Ships are the Only Caravan That Trades upon the Ocean, And travels through the wildernes And Barren Deserts of the Seas Without the Feare of Beasts of Prey Or wilder Arabs in their way; And the wooden Dromedary The Merchant and his Cargo Carry. For trade has wonderful Effects T' Improve the Factory of Sects, For which Dutch Brethren, in Japan, Renounce the Name of Christian: Turn Musselmans again in Afrique To Propagate the Faith of Traffique. As Holland Merchants when the States in Peace Do finde their Actions constantly increase; But English Banians, that Deal with Sects, In Doubtful Times improve their Lewd Effects. Friendship Those whom Conscious Crimes indeare Are Friends ingagd by Hate and Feare; Are but united with the Cement Of Fellow-Sufferers Agreement. Infancy The wit of Children that begins too soon Before th' outgrow their Infancy, is gone. For words are Fitter for a Child to learn Then Matters of a weightier Concern. The only Cloaths, that Embryos weare in th' womb But leave them off, when in the world they come, And Put on others which the Midwife trims To fit the Fashion of their Tender Limbs. Musique Musique is Bewty to the Eare, That charm's the Soules of all that Heare; Attracts Devotion, with its Aire, and words; To string its Beads upon its Charming Cords.... Can se[w] Devotion to an Aire And set a Saraband t' a Prayer. Stinke A Stink that's able To cure th' Infection of a Stable And Prove as great an Antidote Against the Horse-pox as a Goate. A Goat, the Antient say, is never Without an everlasting Feaver. Raysd like a mighty Lord in Mary-land Where he that stinks most, has the greatest Command. Sidrophel Imploy your old Malitious Arts To undermine all Mens Deserts, And, like a Pauper, question those Who you believe have most to loose, Discover Counterfets and Fooles By your own Practices and Rules, Fall foul on all that's good, or Rare, To gaine a Base Informers share, And lewdly intitle others to What you your self are wont to do, Although it yeald you in Returne, Nothing but Infamy, and Scorne. Provoke the Enemy by whom Y' have been Subdu'd, and overcome And by the Law's, and Right of war Have forfited t' your Conqueror All Right and Title you had once T' your Inward, and Outward Dunce. You take a Right Course to reclame The world from Infamy and Shame: For Slander e're so foul, or true, Turnes Honor when it comes from you, And though no Flesh can 'scape the wrong Of your unworm'd, Impetuous Tongue, That still stand's ready to attack Th' unknown, and known behinde his Back (As Cutpurses nere minde what Sum Nor who it is they take it from) You never slip the least occasion T' invade the Instant Reputation: As Heraulds in a wolf or Beare Make Tongue, and Nayles one Culler weare, So you, whose valour's to defame, Make Slander, and Revenge the same; And, as when haughty Sathan fell From Heaven, to the Pit of Hell, He made it his first worke t' intice Mankind to fall from Paradise: So 'tis your Aime to bring all down To that lewd Infamy of your own; An Envoy to negociate in Transactions of Decrepit Sin, In Baudery a Heretique And Pimp to those, that whip and Lick, Has vented many a Strange opinion As if the Dev'l himself were in him. Unclassified verses Iris, on the Banks of Thames, Her Eies bedewd with Teares, To Chloris sayd, Reserve your Flames, For Men are Flatterers. They'l sweare and tell you, it may bee, They Passionately Love, But after ten days Absence—see What Traiters they wil Prove.</field>
