      <field name="fulltext">The .XIII. Bookes Of ÆNEIDOS. TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL Maister Robert Sackeuill Esquire, most worthie Sonne and heire apparant to the Right honorable Syr Thomas Sackeuill Knight, Lorde Buckehurst. A GENERALLSVM whereof all the xij. Bookes of Aeneidos do entreate. When Troy was destroyed by the Greekes, and most of their Nobilitie slayne, Aeneas beinge Sonne to prince Anchises, and begotten of VENVS, a man of most valient courage and vertue (after great slaughter made on his enemies) was forced to flee his countrey, and taking with him his Images and Goddes, whom he than worshipt for his auouries, withdrewe himselfe to the sea, with his sonne Ascanius and his olde father Anchises and family to whom a great number of Troians, from euery quarter resorted, and ioyninge togethers vnder him, erected a Nauie of twentie ships and departed to seas, perswaded by their Goddes, that they should come to a land, where their kingdome should florish. First he arriued in Thracia, and would haue remayned there, but vnderstanding that yonge Polydorus his cosin was murthered there by the kinge thereof, for his Golde, he forsooke that couetous land, after he had builded a citie called by his name Aeneas. From thence he sailed into Candy, where he was setled a while, but he felt his prophecie wrong expounded, and was put from thence by a pestilence. Than remembringe that his auncient forefathers came out of Italy and being better instructed by his Gods, that Italy should be his place and kingdome appointed: hee cut another course to the land of Chaonia, where one Helenus raigned, being his kinsman a Troi?, of whom he learned many thinges touching his Prophecie, and was newly refreshed with men, armour, and treasour. He passed from thence to the yle of Sicil, and was there well receiued of king Acestes his cosin, and there he buried his old father Anchises, by which time, vij. yeres were almost expired. Than hauinge but a short iourney to Italy, hee went thitherwards out of Sicil, and by the waye was taken with an horrible tempest, and driuen from Italy an extreme course, to the countrey of white Moores in Affrike, and after extreme desperation, was honourably there enterteyned of the Queene DIDO a widow, with whom he ioyned in loue, and remayned till his Gods commaunded him forth, and thence he returned in all hast into Sicill. There for his fathers honour he deuised games of actiuitie, &amp; set forth his Obite or yeeres minde, with great solempnitie and triumphe, building a citie called Acesta, where he left much of his people, and with the residue arriued in Italy at Cumas, but by the way he lost Palinurus his cheife maister and Pilot. At Cumas that time vnder a gorgeous temple, Sibly the Prophetisse inhabited deepe in the ground, of whom at length he obteyned, to be conducted to Limbo, and to speake with the soule of his father Anchises, and passed with her through all the places infernall, and at last to the feildes of blisse, which the Pagans tooke for their Paradise: where he conferred with his father, and of him was instructed of all his predestinations and fortunes: but before he descended with Sibly, he buried his noble Trumpettour Misenus. At his comminge vp he buried his nurse, and called that coast of her name Caieta. Then he came saufe into Tyber with all his ships, and landed his people, &amp; shortly compo?ded to marry Lauinia the doughter of king Latinus there raigninge, who beforetime was promised to king Turnus, vpon which occasion arose war betweene the two kings, where in most of al Italy conspired against Aeneas: but he with helpe of a poore king called Euander, and of one Tarchon capitaine of a great people of Etruria, who had expulsed Mezentius their king for his tirranny, did so valiantly behaue him selfe, that after most greeuous conflictes, he slew king Turnus in combat, &amp; wan the Ladie and the kingdome by conquest. Of whose issewe afterward proceeded the greatest Princes of the world, by whom Rome was founded, that sometime was ruler of the vniuersall earth, and yet amonge all christen kingdomes beareth no litle sway of authoritie, and dominion. THE ARGVMENTES OF the thirteene bookes of Aeneidos, expressed in verse. 1. AENEAS, in the first, to Liby land arriueth well. 2. The fall of Troy, and wofull dole, the second booke doth tell. 3. The thyrd of wandringes speakes, and father dead, and laid full low. 4. In fourth Queene Dido burnes, &amp; flames of raginge loue doth show, 5. The fift declareth plaies, and how the fleete with fier was cought. 6. The sixt doth speake of ghosts, and how deepe Plutoes reygne was sought. 7. The seuenth booke, Aeneas bringes vnto his fatall land. 8. The eight prepareth war, and power how foes for to withstand. 9. The ninth of battels telles, and yet the captaine is away. 10. Aeneas greeuous wrath Mezentius, in the tenth, doth slay. 11. The eleuenth in vnequall fight Camilla castes to ground. 12. The twelfth with heauenly weapons giues to Turnus mortall wound. 13. The thirteenth weds Æneas wife, and brings him to eternall life. THE FIRST BOOKE OF the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. When Troy was taken, Aeneas the sonne of Anchises and Venus, a man endued with singular godlinesse, and like valiencie, whilst in the seuenth yeare of his wandring, he sailed vpon the Tyrrhene sea from Sicil, towards Italy a mighty tempest beinge raised by Aeolus the kinge of windes at Iunos request: was driuen to the shoare of Afrike, where entring on the land, he slew with bow and arrowes seuen great Stags &amp; deuided them equally to each Ship one, for so many saile hee had gathered together of his dispearsed fleet, and hartned his souldiers ouerweried now with trauaile, with the hope of future rest: manfully to indure the labours that were yet to come. In the meane while Venus pleadeth her sonne Aeneas, and all the Troians cause before Iupiter, and imputeth all those calamities vnto Iuno: but Iupiter on the other side, disclosing al the order of the destinies, recomforteth his daughter with hope of happy posteritie, and power of the Romanes, wherwith Venus being wel satisfied: meeteth with her sonne Aeneas, being ignorant of the place, and roming vp and downe in the countrey, and sheweth him how that his dispersed ships be safe and telleth him that Carthage is not farre of, a Citie which Dido builded in that place, wherfore Aeneas by his mothers meane beinge shrowded in an hollow cloude accompanied with Achates: entreth into Carthage, where both he findeth his mates safe, and is curteously entertayned of Dido the Queene. Venus notwithstanding not ouermuch trusting to Iunos entertainment, nor the vnconstancie of women, laying Ascanius a sleepe in the woods of Ida: addresseth Cupide in his steede, who amongst embracings, and kisses, priuily inspireth the Queene with the loue of Aeneas. I that my slender Oten Pipe in verse was wont to sounde Other bookes made by Virgil before that great worke. Of woods, and next to that I taught for husbandmen the ground, How fruite vnto their greedy lust they might constraine to bring, A worke of thankes: Lo now of Mars, and dreadfull warres I singe, Of armes, and of the man of Troy, that first by fatall flight Did thence arriue to Lauine land, that now Italia hight. But shaken sore with many a storme by seas and land ytost, And all for Iunos endles wrath that wrought to haue had him lost. And sorrowes great in warres hee bode, ere hee the walls could frame Of mighty Rome, and bring the gods t'aduance the Romaine name. He calles for diuine power.Now Muse direct my song to tell for what offence and why: What ayled so the queene of gods to dryue thus cruelly, This noble prince of vertue mylde from place to place to toile, Such paines to take? may heauenly mindes so sore in rancour boile? There was a towne of auncient time Carthago of olde it hight, Against Italia and Tybers mouth lay loofe at seas aright: Both ritch in wealth and sharpe in war, the people it helde of Tyre: This towne aboue all townes to raise was Iunos most desire, Forsooke her seate at Samos yle and here her armes shee set, Her chare, and here shee mindes to make (if all gods do not let) Affrik otherwise called Lybia, did worship Iuno which was enemie to troians.An empire all the world to rule: but heard she had beforne From Troy should rise a stock, by whom their towres should al be torne, That far and wide should beare the rule, so fearce in war to feele: That Lyby land destroy they should, so fortune turnes the wheele. For feare of that, and calling eft the old war to her minde, That shee at Troy had done before for Greekes her freends so kinde. Ne from her hart the causes olde of wrath and sore disdaine Was slaked yet, but in her brest high spite did still remaine. How Paris Venus beauty praised, and hers esteemed at naught. Shee abhors the stock and Ganimede whom Ioue to heau? had raught, Thus flamed in her moode, shee kest through all the seas to throwe The entent of this work is only to tell the begining of Rome.The sely poore remaine of Troy that Greekes had laide so low. And them that wilde Achilles wrath had spared aliue at last From Italy shee thought to keepe, till destnies should be past. And many a yeare they wandred wide, in seas and sundry pyne, So huge a worke of weight it was, to build of Rome the lygne. Scant from the sight of Sicil yle, their sailes in merry aray Went vnder winde, and through the seas, &amp; salt some made their way: When Iuno her bethought againe of her immortall wound Iuno fretting with her selfe.Unto her selfe. And shall I thus be conquerd, and confound? And shall I leaue it thus quoth shee? shall yet this Troian kinge For all my worke to Italie this people safely bringe? I trow the destnie wils it so, but did not Pallas burne A fleete of Greekes, and in the seas them all did ouerturne For one mans sinne, and for the fault of Aiax made to fall? Shee threw the fiers of mighty Ioue from skies vpon them all. And drownd their ships, and hee him selfe with whirlewinde set a fier All smoking on the rocks shee kest his carcas to expier. But I, that queene of gods am calde and sister of Ioue in throne And eke his wife, how long I war with this poore stocke alone? So many a yere? and who shall now dame Iunos godhead know, Or shortly vpon mine altars who due honours will bestow? Thus rolling in her burning brest shee straight to Æolia hyed, Into the countrey of cloudy skyes where blustring windes abide. Aeolia a windy countrey. King Aeolus the wrastling windes in caues hee locks full low: In prison strong the stormes hee keepes forbidden abrode to blow. They for disdaine with murmour great at euery mouth do rage, But hee a loft with mace in hand their force doth all aswage. If hee so did not: lands and seas and skyes they would so sweepe Within a while, that all were gone. Therfore in dongeons deepe Almighty Ioue did close them vp and hilles hath ouerset, And made a kinge, that should know when to louse them, when to let. Whom to intreat this Iuno came, and thus to him shee spake: King Aeolus, for vnto thee the great god hath betake And giuen thee leaue to lift the flouds and calme to make them still: On Tyrrhen sea there sailes a fleete that beares mee no good will. To Italy they minde to passe, a new Troy there to bylde. Let out thy windes and all their ships do drowne with waters wylde. Disperse them al to sundry shores or whelme them downe with deepe. An angri goddesse. Of goodly Ladies seuen and seuen about mee I do keepe, Wherof the fairest of them all that cald is Deiopey, Shalbe thine owne for euermore, my minde if thou obey, And of a goodly sonne (quod shee) shee shall thee make a syer. To that said Aeolus: O Queene what needes all this desier? Commaund me dame, I must obey, my duty it is of right, By you this kingdome first I gat, and grace of Ioue on hight. You make mee sit among the gods at bankets this ye know, You gaue mee might these stormy windes to straine, or make to blow. Hee turnd his sword when this was said, and through the hill he pusht And at that gap with thronges atones the windes forth out they rusht. The whirlewindes to the land went out, and then to seas they flewe, Both East and West, and from the sands the waues aloft they threw. The stormy South againe the cliues the waters driue so hie, A sodayn storme.That cables all began to cracke and men for dreed to crie. Anon was taken from Troians eyes both sight and light of sonne And on the sea the grim darke night to close all in begonne. The thonders roard, and lightninge lept full oft on euery side: There was no man but present death before his face espide. Aeneas than in euery lim with colde began to quake, With hands vp throw? to heauens aloft his mone thus gan he make. O ten times treble blessed men that in their parents sight, Before the loftie walles of Troy, did lose their liues in fight. O Diomedes, valiaunt lord, and guide of Greekes most stout, drowning is miserable.Could I not of thy force haue fallen, and shed my life right out: In Troian feeldes? where Hector ferce lyeth vnder Achilles launce King Serpedon and many a lord, how blis-full was their chaunce? Whose bodies with their armes and sheeldes in Simois waters sinkes. A piteus tempest.As hee thus spake, the Northerne blast his sailes brake to the brinkes, Unto the skies the waues them lift, their ores bin all to torne, Away goeth helme, and with the surge the ship side downe is borne, In come the seas, and hie as hilles some hang in floods aboue, Some downe the gaping water sends against the sands to shoue. There three at once the Southerne winde into the rocks hath cast (So they call stones that in the seas like altars lie full fast) And three the Easterne winde also (that pittie it is to thinke) Out of the deepe into the sholdes, and quicksands made to sinke. And one that men of Lycia land, and trustie Orontes helde, Afore his face there fell a sea that made the puppe to yelde. And hedlong downe the maister fals, and thrise the keele aground The water whirld, and at the last the wilde sea swallowd round. Than might you see both here and there, men with their armor swim, The robes and painted pompe of Troy lay fleeting on the brim, And now the ships where Ilionee, and where Achates strong, And where as Abas went, and where Alethes liuing long, The wether had won, and through the ribs the seas came wonders fast A frende in extremitie.When sodenly the god Neptune vpstart him all agast. With wonder how so great a rage should hap to him vntolde, And forth his noble face he puts the waters to behold, There saw hee how Aeneas ships through all the seas bespred, And Troian folkes ydround with flood, and stormes falne ouer head. Anon the craft therof hee knew, and Iuno his sisters yre. Strait by their names hee calls the windes, who than began retire. Are you so bold you blasts (quod hee) without my licence here The lands and skies and seas also with such a storme to stere? I will be quite: but first is best the floods to set in stay, And after this for your deserts be sure I shall you pay. In haste begone, go tell your king the seas is not his charge, But vnto mee that lot befell with mace threeforked large. Not here, but in his caues of winde, his court go bid him keepe. There let him if hee list, you blasts enclose in prison deepe. This spoken with a thought he makes the swelling seas to cesse, Obedi?ce of waters And sunne to shine, and clouds to flee, that did the skies oppresse, The Mermaids therwithall appeares, and Triton fleetes aboue, And with his forke they all the ships from rocks do softly moue. Then lets he lose the perlous sands that ships away may slide, And on the sea full smooth his chaire with wheeles hee made to ride. And like as in a people stout whan chaunceth to betide The multitude to make a fray of wit full often wide, That stones, and weapons flies abroad, and what come first to hande, Some sad man comth, that for his right is loued of all the lande: Anon they cease and silence make, and downe they lay their rage, To harke at him, and he with speech their wood mindes doth asswage. So fell this deadly fray at sea, when Neptune had controlde The waters wilde, and through the seas his chaire abroad had rolde. The men of Troy vnto the shore that next was in their sight Made haste to draw, and on the coast of Africa they light. They were driuen to Afrike. Far in the shore there lieth an yle, and there besides a bay, Where from the chanell deepe the hauen goeth in and out alway. On either side the reaches hie, to heauen vp clime to grow, And vnder them the still sea lyeth, for there no breath can blow. But greene wood like a garland growes, and hides them al with shade And in the mids a pleasaunt caue there stands of nature made, Where sits the Nimphes among the springs in seats of mosse and stone When ships are in, no cables neede nor ankers neede they none. Then from the ship to walke a land Aeneas longed sore, And chose of all the number seuen and brought with him to shore. There by a banke their weary limmes of salte sea did they stretch, And first Achates from the flint a sparke of fier did fetch, Ease after trauaile. Which he receiued in matter meete, and drie leaues laide about, Than vittailes out they laid a land, with seas welnere ymard. And corne to drie they set, and some with stones they brused hard, Ther whilest Aeneas vp the rocke was gone to walke on hie, To see where any ships of his astray he might espie, If Caicus armes vpon the sayle, or Capis haps to showe. No boat in sight, but on the shore three Harts there stood arowe: And after them the heard behinde along the valley fed. Hee stayed, and of his bow and bolts Achates strait him sped. The cheefe that hiest bare their heads, adowne with darts he kest, And to the woods he followed than with like pursuite the rest. Hee left them not till seuen of them were falne with bodies great, To match the number of his ships that now had neede of meate. Than to the hauen hee doth the flesh among his men deuide, And pipes of wine departed eke that was abourd that tide, Which good Acestes had them giuen when they from Sicile went. Good comfort of a captaine.And than to cheere their heauy harts with these wordes hee him bent. O mates quod hee, that many a woe haue bidden and borne ere this. Worse haue wee seene, and this also shal end when gods will is. Through Scilla rage (you wot) and through the roring rocks we past, Though Ciclops shore was full of feare, yet came we through at last. Plucke vp your harts &amp; driue from thence both thought and fear away, To thinke on this may pleasure be perhaps another day. With paines and many a daunger sore by sundry chaunce we wende, To come to Italia where wee trust to finde our restinge ende, And where the destnies haue decreed Troys kingdomes eft to rise, Be bolde, and harden now your selues take ease when ease applise. Thus spake hee tho, but in his hart huge cares him had opprest, Under y? name of Aeneas, is described in Virgil y? parte of a perfit wise man &amp; valiant captaine [illeg.] marke it.Dissembling hope with outward eyes, full heauy was his brest, Then all bestird them to the pray, the bankets gan begin, The skinnes from of the flesh they pluckt, and eke thentrailes within. Some cut their shares and quaking yet on broches gan to broyle, Some blew the fier to burne, and some their cawdrons set to boyle. Good cheare they made and fed them fast as on the grasse they sat, With wine and vittailes of the best, and red deare good and fat. Whan meat was done and honger past, and trenchers vp were take, Great search and talking for their freends that were behind they make. In hope and dread of them they stand, and whether a liue they bee, Or what is else of them become, or shall they them euer see. But chiefly good Aeneas did the case full sore lament Of stout Orontes and Amicus whom the seas had hent, And other whiles he sighed sore for Licus pitteous fall, And mighty Gias and Cloanthus mournd hee most of all. And now an end therof there was, when Ioue him selfe on hie Beheld the seas where shippes do saile, and broad londs vnder skie. And from the tops of heauens aboue hee cast his eyes adowne, And staid to looke on Affrike land and who there bare the crowne. And vnto him as to and fro his carefull minde he cast: Came Venus in, and sad shee was vnlike her custome past. With teares about her eyes so bright she thus began to playne: O king (quod she) that ouer vs all both gods and men doost raigne For euermore, and with thy dints of lighting makest a fright: What hath my sonne Aeneas wrought or spoken againe thy might? What hath the simple Troians done? that after tormentes all, From Italy to keepe them of the world is made to small? Somtime ye saide there should arise (whan yeares were comen about) The men of Rome that of the ligne of Troy should be so stout, That seas and londs should to their rule both far and nie suppresse. What makes O mighty father now your will away to dresse? In hope therof ywis I tooke the fall of Troy so light, And thought amends should now be made and pleasure paine to quite. But now I see the same mischance the poore men yet to chase. What ende therof shall we awaite at your almightie grace? Antenor through the mids of Greece had fortune safe to steale, And to Lyburnus kingdome came as destnie list to deale. Euen to the middes therof, and head wherout Tymauus springes, Where issues nine the sea makes in, for noise the mountaine ringes. Yet for the men of Troy to dwell a cittie bylte he there, Padua by name, and gaue them lawes and armes of Troy to beare. Now lieth he there in pleasaunt rest, no wight him doth disease, But wee your stocke whom to the starres of heauen admit you please, Our ships destroyed (I abhor to thinke) and for the cruell spight Of one alone, wee be betraied and spoiled of our right, Ne to the coasts of Italy for ought we can attaine. Is this the fathers loue wee finde? so stablish you my raigne? The maker of the Gods and men to her all sweetely smiles With countnance such as from the skies y? stormes &amp; clouds exiles. And sweetly kost his daughter deare, and therwithall hee speakes: Feare not (quod he) thy mens good hap, for none their fortune breakes, Thy kingdome prosper shall, and eke the walles I thee behight, Thou shalt see rise in Lauine land and grow full great of might. Prophesies spoken by Ioue to Venus of thinges that after ensued.And thou thy sonne Aeneas stout to heauen shalt bring at last, Among the gods be sure of this, my minde is fixed fast. And now to thee disclose I shall (for sore I see thee dout) The long discourse of destenies that yeres shall bring about. Great war in Italy haue he shall, ere hee the people wilde May vndertread, and learne to liue, and then the cittie bilde. That sommers three, ere hee shall sit as king them shall renew, And winters three, before he can the Rutyls al subdew. Than shall Ascanius (now a childe) whose name Yulus hight, (Was Ylus cald when Troys estate and kingdome stoode vpright) Till space of thirtie yeares expire his kingdome shall obtaine, And hee from Lauyne shall translate the olde state of the raigne, And strongly fortifie the towne of Alba longe shall hee, Where whole three hundred yeres the stocke of Hector kings shall bee. Romulus &amp; Remus were nourished of a shee Wolfe.Till Ilia Queene, with childe by Mars two twinnes to light shal bring Whom wolues shal nurse, &amp; proud therof he growes that shalbe king. He Romulus shal take the rule, and vp the walles shall frame Of mightie Rome, and Romaines all shal call then of his name, No ende to their estate I set, ne termes of time or place, But endles shall their empire grow, and Iunos cruell grace That now with feare the ground beneath turmoiles, and eke the skies, Shall leaue her wrath, and worke with mee, and take more sad auise, To loue the Romaines lords of peace, and people clad in gowne. Let it be so: let time roll on, and set forth their renowne. Then shal be borne of Troian blood the emprour Cæsar bright, Whose empire through the seas shal stretch &amp; fame to heauen vpright And Iulius his name it is of mighty Iule deriued: Him laden ful of Esterne spoiles by him in wars atchiued, In heauen thou shalt bestow full glad, and vowes men shal him hight Then downe goth war, men shal be milde, in armes shal not delight, Then truth and right and Romane gods shal sit with lawes in hand, The gates of war with bolts and bars of hard steele fast shall stand. And therewithin on armour heapes sits Batail rage, and wailes With brazen chaines an hundred bounde, his wrastling not auailes. Thus much hee sayd, and downe anon the sonne of May he sent, That new Carthage, and all the coasts of Affrike should be bent The Troians to receiue a land, least Dido there the Queene Mercurie, the sonne of May. Might from her shore expell them of, ere she the cause had seene. And downe he flies him through the skies, with winges as swift as winde, And on the land of Lyby stoode, and did his fathers minde. With that the Moores laid downe their rage (as god did bid) and eeke The Queene her selfe gan turne, and to the Troians waxed meeke. But good Aeneas all that night his minde about hee tost, And in the morning went him out to search and see the cost, To learne what land they were come to, what people dwelt theron, If men or saluage beasts it hold, for tild he could see none. This would he know, and to his men the truth of all to tell. Therwhilest within a water caue his ships hee made to dwell, Whom trees &amp; woods with shadowes thicke and eke the rock doth hide. Than forth he goth, and tooke but one Achates by his side. And launces two they bare in hand of mettall sharpe and light, And as they went amid the wood he met his mother right, Most like a maide in maidens weede, she maidens armour beares, As doth Harpalicee the Queene that horses wilde outweares. So wight of foote, that Heber streame so swift she leaues behinde, For hunterlike her bow she bare, her locks went with the winde Behinde her backe, and tuckt she was that naked was her knee. She cald to them and said, good sirs, I pray you did you see To stray this way as ye haue come, my sisters any one? With quiuer bound that in the chase of some wild beast are gone? Or with a cry pursueth a pace the fomy bore to paine? So Venus said, and Venus sonne her answerd thus againe. None of thy sisters haue I seene nor heard, I thee assure O maide, what shall I make of thee, thy face I see so pure. Not mortall like, ne like mankinde thy voice doth sound, I gesse Some goddesse thou art, and Phebus bright thy brother is doubtles, Or of the noble Nymphes thou comest, of grace wee thee beseech What euer thou art, and helpe our neede, and now vouchsafe to teache What land is this? what coast of heauen be wee come vnder here? Where neither man nor place we know, so straied we haue in fere, Out of our course wee haue beene cast with windes and floods yshake. Afore thine altars many a beast to offer I vndertake. As for mine altars (quod she tho) no such estate I beare, The manner is of virgins here this short aray to weare. In purple weede wee vse to walke with quiuer light vnbounde, The realme of Affrike here thou seest, and men of Tyrus ground. Here is the citie of Agenor, fearce be the lands about, Queene Dido rules and weares the crowne from Tyrus she came out, And lately from her brother fled, the cause is long to lere. The story long, but touch I will the chiefe and leaue it there. Sicheus was her husband tho: the richest man of ground In all that coast, and deepe (good hart) in loue with her was dround. For her to him her father gaue a virgin yet vntwight, And to her brother came the crowne of Tyrus than by right Pigmalion, a sinfull wretch of all that euer raignde, Whom couetise did blinde so sore, and rage of fury strainde, That vnaware, with priuye knife before the altars pure He slew Sicheus, and of his sisters loue he thought him sure. And long he kept the deede in close, and she good soule full sad, The crafty theefe made wondrous meanes &amp; tales her minde to glad, But in a dreame (vnburied yet) her husband came t'appere With visage pale, and wondrous hewes, full deadly was his chere, And told her all, and wide his wound disclosing shewd his brest, How hee before the altars was, for what intent opprest. And bad her flee the wicked soile ere worse might her befall. And treasor vnder ground he shewd to helpe her therwithall, Both golde and siluer plenty great vnknowen til than, and so This Dido did, and made her freends and ordeind forth to go. Than such as for his wicked life the cruell tyrant hates, Or bin afraid of him for ought, them gets out of the gates In ships that readie lay by chaunce, the gold with them they packt They spoild also Pigmalion, this was a womans acte. Than past they forth and here they came, where now thou shalt espie The hugy walles of new Carthage that now they rere so hie. They bought the soile and Birsa it cald whan first they did begin, As much as with a bull hide cut they could inclose within. But what are you faine would I know, or what coast come yee fro? Where would you bee? demaunding thus he answerd her vnto With sighing deepe, and from his brest heauy his tale he fet. O lady mine (quod he) to tell if nothing did mee let, And of our paines ye list to heare the stories out at large: The day were short, and ere an end the sunne would him discharge. Of auncient Troy (if euer Troy beside your eares hath past) Of thence be wee: by sundrie seas and coasts wee haue ben cast. And now the tempest hath vs brought to Lyby land by chaunce, My name Aeneas clepid is: my countrey gods (t'aduaunce) In ships I bring: vnto the starres well blased is my fame, Of Italy I seeke the lond, and Ioues of-spring I am. A Troian fleete I tooke to sea with twentie vessels wide, My mother goddesse taught my way, as destnie did mee guide. Now seuen therof do skant remaine, the rest with wethers gone, And I vnknowen in wildernesse here walke and comfort none. From Asia and from Europa quite thus driuen I am: with that Shee could no longer bide him speake, but brake his tale therat. What euer thou art (quoth shee) for well I wot the gods aboue Doth loue thee much to saue thy life to this place to remoue. Go forth to yonder Palais straight, assay the Queene to see, For safe thy companie a land be set beleeue thou mee. And safe thy ships are come to shore, with Northen winde at will, An old superstition of diuinati? by birds, called augurium. Onles my cunninge failes mee now whom wont I was to skill. Behold the flocke of sixe and sixe that yonder cheerly flies Of Swannes, whom late an Egle ferce did chace through all the skies, Now toward lond, or on the lond, they seeme their course to keepe, And as for ioy of danger past their wings aloft they sweepe With myrth and noise: right so thy men and all thy ships a row Be come to hauen, or neare the hauen in safegard, this I know. Now get thee forth, and where the way thee leades hold on thy pace. Skant had she said, and therwithall she turnd aside her face, As red as rose she gan to shine, and from her heauenly heare The flauour sprang, as Nectar sweet, downe fell her kirtell there, And like a goddesse right she fled. Whan he his mother wist, He folowed fast and calde (alas) what meane you, thus to list In fained shapes so oft to mee begiling to appeare? Why hand in hand imbrace we not, and iointly speake and heare? Thus plaining sore he still his pace vnto the citie holdes. But Venus as they went, a weede about them both she foldes, Of myst and cloud and aire so thicke, that no man should them spie, Venus inclosed th? both in a cloude. Ne do them harme, nor interrupt, nor aske them who nor why. Her selfe by skie to Paphos yeede where stonds her honor seates, And temple ritch, and of encense a hundred altars sweates, And where of flowres and garlands fresh her flore is alway spred. They in that while went on their way wherto the path them led. And now come vp they were the hill that nere the citie lies, From whence the towres and castels all bin subiect to their eyes. Aeneas wondred at the worke where sometime sheepe were fed, And on the gates hee wondred eke, and noise in streetes yspred. The Moores with courage went to worke, some vnder burdens grones, Some at the wals &amp; towres with hands were tumbling vp the stones. Some measurd out a place to build their mansion house within, Some lawes and officers to make in parlament did begin. An other sort a hauen had cast, and deepe they trench the ground. Some other for the games and plaies a stately place had found, And pillers great they cut for kings to garnish forth their halles. And like as bees among the floures, whan fresh the sommer falles In shine of sun applie their worke, when growen is vp their yonge, Or when their hiues they gin to stop, and honie sweete is spronge, That all their caues and cellers close with dulcet liquor filles, Some doth onlade, some other brings the stuffe with ready willes, Some time they ioyne and all at once do from their mangers fet The slouthfull drones that would consume, &amp; nought will do to get. The worke it heates, the hony smelles of flowres and Tyme ywet. O happy men whose fortune is your walles now thus to rise Aeneas said, and to the tops of al hee kest his eyes. Encompast with the cloude he goth (a wondrous thing to skill) And through the mids of men onseene he comth and goth at will. Amids the towne a groue there stoode full gladsome was the shade, Where first the Moores by wether cast, and stormes into that trade At y? fo?dation of Carthage a horses head was fo?d, like [illeg.] at the buildinge of Rome the hed of a man.Had made a marke, and digde the place, where shortly they had founde A horses head of courage hie, so Iuno did compound, That by that signe they vnderstood their stocke should prosper stout In wars and fame, and light to finde in time by lands about. And in that place Queene Dido had a gorgeous temple set With ritches great, no spare of cost should Iunos honor let. The brasen grees afore the doores did mount, and eke the beames With brasse are knit, and vauts &amp; doores of brasse and mettal streames. There in that wood a sodaine sight his feare began to slake, And there Aeneas first him dares to trust, and comfort take. For, as within that temple wide on euery thing hee gazed, And waited whan the Queene should come, and stood as one amazed To see the worke, and how to state so soone the towne was brought, And wondred at the precious things the craftsmen there had wrought: Hee seeth among them all the iests of Troy, and stories all, And wars that with their fame had filde all kingdoms great and small. King Priame and Atridas twaine, and wroth to both Achille. Hee staide with teares, and said alas, what land hath not his fille Of our decay (Achates mine) what place is void? beholde Where Priam is, lo here some praise is left him for his golde. Here is a sight for man to mourne, and sample take in minde. Cast of thy care, for of this fame some comfort thou shalt finde. So said, but yet with picture vaine a while his minde hee fed With many sigh, and largy streames out from his eies he shed. For there hee saw, how in the fight the walles of Troy about Here fled the Greekes, and them pursued the youth of Troian rout. Here they of Troy be chased afore Achilles wilde in chare. The battels and siege of Troye painted at full in the temple. Not far aloofe was Ryses campe that white in banners bare. Hee mournd to thinke how soone betraide they were, and fast a sleepe Tytides them in bloody fight destroied with slaughter deepe, And brought away their horses stont, ere once they had assaid The taste of Troian pastures, or their feete in water laid. Another way was Troylus seene to run with armour broke, Unlucky lad, and match vnmeete Achilles to prouoke. His horses fled, and hee along in chare was ouercast. Yet held hee still the raines in hand, and ere a while is past, By heare and head vnto the ground Achilles hath him hent, And with his speare to cruell death in dust he hath him sent. Therwhiles vnto the temple great of angry Pallas went The wiues of Troy, with heare vnfolde a veill they did present With humble teares, and on their brest to knock they nothing spares. Shee turnes her face, and fast her eies vpon the ground she stares. Three times about the walles of Troy was Hector haled on ground, His carkas eke Achilles had for gold exchaunged round. Then from the bottom of his brest a hougy sigh hee drew, Whan of his freend the cruell spoile, and chare, and corps he knew. And Priamus hee saw to pray with hands abrode on knee. And eke him selfe among the lords of Greece he saw to bee. And armies out of Inde there came and Memnons blacke aray, And from the realme of Amazon with thronges and targets gay Penthasilee Virago feers, amids the millions standes In armour girt, her pappe set out with lace of golden bandes, A Queene of war, though maide she bee, with men she likes to trie. Shee would be knowen for a woman.While thus about this Troian duke Aeneas led his eie With maruel much, and ernest stoode him still in one to vew, To temple comes this Dido lo, the Queene so faire of hew. Of lordes and lusty yonkers fine about her many a rout. Most like vnto Diana bright when shee to hunt goth out Upon Eurotas bankes, or through the cops of Cynthus hill, Whom thousands of the ladie Nimphes await to do her will. Shee on her armes her quiuer beres, and all them ouershines, And in her brest the tikling ioy her hart to mirth enclines. So Dido came, and freshly glad among the prease shee past. And forward shee their worke set forth and cherly bids them hast. Whan shee into the temple came, before the goddesse gate Amids her gard, her downe shee sat in seate of great estate. There iustice, right and law she gaue, and labours did deuide In equall parts, or els by lot let men their chaunce abide. Whan sodenly Aeneas seeth with great concourse to throng Both mighty Anteas and Serestus, and Cloanthus strong. And other Troians many one, whom wethers wide had spred And driuen abroad in sondry sortes to diuers coastes yled. Astoind with him Achates was, for ioy they would haue lept To ioyne their hands, but feare againe them held and close ykept. They looked on, and through the cloud they hid, did all beholde What chaunce they had, &amp; where their ships, &amp; what shore might them holde, What make they there, for men yculde of al the nauy cheefe With cries into the temple came, to seeke the Queenes releefe. Whan they were in, and license had before the Queene to speake, The greatest lord sir Ilionee, thus gan the silence breake. The oration of Ilioneus to Dido.O Queene, to whom is giuen of god to bilde this citie new, And for your iustice peoples proud and saluage to subdue, Wee Troians poore, whom through the seas all tempests tossed haue, Beseeke your grace our seely ships from wicked fier to saue. Haue mercy vpon our gentle stocke, and graciously relieue Our painfull case: wee come not here with wepons you to greeue, To spoile the coast of Lyby land, nor booties hence to beare. Wee conquerd men be not so bolde, our pride neede none to feare. There is a place the Greekes by name Hesperia do call, An auncient lond and stout in war, and fruitfull soile withall. Out from Enotria they came that first did till the same, Now Italy men say is calde so of the captaines name, To that our course was bent, Whan sodenly there rose at south a winde and tempest wood That toward shore enforst to fall, and so tooke on the flood, That in the rockes we be disperst, wee few this coast haue caught. What kind of men be these of yours? what maners wild ytaught This countrey keepes? to lodge in sand wee can not suffred bee, They fight, and none to tread a land they can content to see? If mortall men you do despise and care for none in fight: Yet haue respect to gods aboue that iudge both wrong and right. Wee had a king Aeneas cald, a iuster was there none In vertue, nor in feates of war, or armes could match him one. Whom if the destnies keepes aliue (if breath and aier of skies Hee drawes, nor yet among the goasts of cruell death hee lies) There is no feare it shalbe quit the fauour now you showe, You first his kindnes to prouoke shal neuer repent I know. In diuerse yles some cities be that Troian armour beares, Of Troians blood there is also Acestes crowne that weares. Now giue vs leaue our shaken ships to lay a land wee pray, And timber to repare them eke, and ores to passe our way: That with our king if wee can meete, and eke our felowes moe: To Italy by your reliefe with glad chere wee may goe. But if that comfort all be past, and mightie father thee The Lyby seas hath had, nor of Ascanius hope may wee: Yet at the least to Sicil yle, and seates that will not swarue, From whence we came let vs depart, and king Acestes serue. So said sir Ilionee, the rest of Troians cried the same At once with murmour great. Than Dido shortly full demure her eies downe set, and thus Cast of your care you Troians, set your harts at ease for vs. Great neede, and yet the raw estate of this my kingdome new, Compels mee thus my coast to kepe, and wide about mee view. Who knowes not of Aeneas? who? or hath not heard the name Of lusty Troy: and of the men and all that war the flame? The further from the son, y? duller wittes. The c?mon people imagined the son to be caried about in a charet w? horses.Wee Moores be not so base of wit, ne yet so blunt of minde, Ne from this towne the sunne his steedes so far away doth winde. Go where you please, to Italy to old Saturnus feeldes, Or get you into Sicile land that king Acestes weeldes. I will you helpe, and see you safe, and giue you goods to go. Will you remaine euen here with mee? can you content you so? This towne is yours, I haue it made, set vp your ships anone: A Troian and a Moore to mee indifferent shalbe one. And would to god your king had hapt this way also to bend, And were him selfe Aeneas here, forsooth I wil out send Along the coasts and wildernes, perhaps he may be found, If any where in townes hee straies, or woods of Affrike ground. With this the Troians comfort tooke, and now Achates strong, And lorde Aeneas through the cloud to breake they thought it long. Achates to Aeneas first him drew and to him said: Thou goddesse son what meanst thou thus? how long shal we be staid? All thing thou seest is safe and sure, our fleete, our freends, and all. Wee misse but one whom in the mids of floods we saw to fall And drownd, but in the rest I see your mothers tale is trew. Skant had he spoke, and sodainly the cloud from them withdrew, And vanisht into aier alone, and left them bare in light. Aeneas stood and freshly shinde, al men behold him might, Most like a god with face and hew, for than his mother deare Set forth her sonne with shoulders faire, and comly shind his heare. And with a roset youth his eies and countnance ouer cheard, And white as burnisht Iuerie fine his necke and hands appeard. Ful like as if the siluer cleare, or pearles are put in golde. Than to the Queene hee steps, and said (all sodainly) beholde Hee that you seeke, lo here I am, Aeneas Troian I: Escaped from the Lyby seas where lost I was welme. O Queene that in our woes (alone) such merry doost extende To vs the poore remaine of Troy, that welnie brought to an ende By seas and lands are tost and tierd, of all thing bare and peld, Our towne, our house, our peoples eke: you worthy thankes to yeld It lieth not Dido in our power, nor what is euery where Of Troian blood, not all that through the wide world scattred were. The almighty gods (if pitie they regard, or if there bee Of iustice any whit, or soule that vertue loues to see) Do pay thy meede: what happy world forth such a treasor brought? What blessed father thee begat, and mother such hath wrought? While floods into the seas do run, while hilles do shadowes cast, And while the stars about the skies doth turne and tary fast: Shall neuermore with me thy name thy praise and honor end, What land soeuer calth me too. So said, and than his frend Sir Ilionee by hand he tooke, and than Serestus strong, And Gias and Cloanthus eke, and other his lordes in throng. The Queene astonied gan to bee, whan first she saw the sight, And waied the chaunce of such a lorde, and thus her words she dight. Thou goddesse son, what fortune thee through al these dangers driues? What force vnto this cruell shore thy person thus arriues? Art thou not hee Aeneas whom from Dardanus the king, Anchises gat on Venus hie, where Symois doth spring? Ere this I well remember, how that Teucer from his raigne Expulsed was, and to the towne of Sidon flee was faine, Some helpe at Belus hand toptaine, his kingdome to restore. Than ward my father Belus wide in Cypers land so sore, And conquerd all and kept the state, that time I heard the fall Of Troy, and eke the name of thee, and kings reheased all. Their enmies of the Troians than great praise abrode did blow, And of the auncient race of Troy to come hee would be know. Wherfore approche, and welcome al, my houses shall you host, For like mischaunce with labours sore, my selfe somtime hath tost. And fortune here hath set me now, this land thus to subdew, By proofe of paine I haue ben taught on painfull men to rew. Thus talked shee, and than Aeneas to her pallais brought, Whan on their altars they had done such honors as they thought. Yet ceassed not the Queene to send vnto his men that tide A skore of bulles, and eke of brawnes a hundred rough of hide, And with the dammes a hundred more of lambes both good and fat, The gladsome giftes of god. The inner court was all beset with riches round about, And in the mids the feastes they gan prepare for all the rout, With precious clothes &amp; conning wrought, &amp; proudly enbrodred wide. And on the bourdes the mighty piles of plate there stoode beside, Wheron was grauen in golden worke the stories all by rowe, And deedes of lordes of antike fame a long discourse to know. Aeneas than (for in his minde could loue not let him rest:) His freend Achates for his sonne Ascanius hath him drest Unto the ships, and bad him tell the newes, and bring him there As fast as may, for in Ascanius fixt was all his feare. And gifts with him he had to bring from Troy destroied yfet. A royal pal, that al with gold and stones was ouerset, And eke a robe with borders rich, sometime it was the weede Of Helene bright, whan Paris her from Greece to Troy did leede. Her mother Ledas gift it was, a wondrous worke to vew. A scepter eke that Ilionee king Priams daughter trew Was wont to beare, and more a brooch that from her necke went down With precious pearles, and double set of fine golde eke a crown. These things to fet Achates hast vnto the nauie makes. But Venus strange deuises new, and counsails new she takes, Venus transformeth Cupide her son into y? likenes of Ascanius.That Cupide shall the face and hew of sweete Ascanius take, And beare the presents to the Queene her heart a fier to make With feruent loue, and in her bones to fling the priuy flame. Suspect she doth the Moores, that haue of dooble toong the name, And Iunos wrath her frets, and in the night her care returnes. Therfore shee thus exhortes her son Cupide that louers burnes. My son, that art my stay alone, my great renowne and might, My son, that of the thonderblastes of hye Ioue setst but light, How through the seas Aeneas mine thy brother hath ben thrown By cruell Iunos wicked wrath, to thee is not vnknown. And often mournd with mee thou hast therfore, but so it is. With Dido Queene he lodgeth now, and faire he flattred is. But wherto Iunos Innes will turne, is matter hard to know, In such a time of daunger great thou maist not bee to slow. Wherfore preuenting al mischaunce, I list to worke a wile, And with the flame of loue I meane the Queene now to begyle. Lest by some misaduenture bad her minde she haply turne, But for Aeneas loue with mee somedeale I like she burne. And how this thing ywrought shalbe, giue eare and know my minde. Now goth the child, my cheefest care vnto his father kinde Into the town, and from the seas the presentes forth he brings That from the flames of burning Troy was kept as worthy things. Him purpose I a sleape to make, and into hie Cithere, Or to my seates in Ida mount, all onaware to beare, That from this craft he may be far, ne let herein do make, Thou for a night, and not beyond, his forme and figure take Her to begile, and of a childe thou childe put on the face, That whan within her lappe the Queene thee gladly shal embrace, Among the royall pompe of meate and wine of Bacchus blisse, Want?snes after good fare And clippes thee sweete, and on thy lipps doth presse the pleasant kisse: Disperse in her the secret flame and poyson sweete inspier. Loue doth obey, puts of his winges, and after her desier Puts on Ascanius shap forthwith, and like the same he went. But Venus on Ascanius sweete a restfull slomber cast, And in her bosome vp she beares, and forth with him she past To Ida woods, where beds of Tyme and Maioram so soft, And lusty flowres in greenewod shade him breathes and comforts oft. And now is Cupide on his way, Achates with him yeid, The royal presents to the court they bare as they were bydde. Whan in they came, the Queene her set in chaire on carpet gay, Of kingly state, with hangings riche in golde and proud aray. And now the Lord Aeneas eke and youth of Troian rout Together came, in purple seates bestowd they were about. The waiters gaue the waters sweete, and princely towels wrought, And eke the bread in sondrie gyse on baskets fine they brought. And fifty ladies far within there was, that had the charge Of all the feast to be set forth, and fiers on altars large. A hundred more to wait and carue, and like of age and trade, A hundred gentlemen, the bourdes with deinty fare to lade. And many lords of Moores among, at euery bourd to dine Came in, and were commaunded sit on picturd carpets fine. They wondred at the presents there, they wondred at Iule, His countnaunce quick, and wel that god his eyes &amp; toong could rule. But specially the Queene was caught in meruell to behold Upon the chyld, vpon the pall, the giftes and robe of gold. No sight her eyes could draw therfrom, and as shee looked more: The more shee fell into the flame, that after paind her sore. But chiefly to the noble boy she moues, who in a while Whan he his father false with loue and kissing did begyle: Unto the Queene he drew, and her with eyes and brest and all About her necke embraceth sweete, and whole on her doth fall. She on her lap somtime him sets, good Dido nothing knowes How great a god vpon her sits, what cares on her hee throwes. He thinking on his mothers art, by small and small doth make. The Queene forget her husband dead, and him from minde to shake. And where of loue she nothing feeles her hart she kept so true: Her wonted heat and old desires he steeres and doth renue. Whan men from meat began to rest, and trenchers vp were take, Great bolles of wines along they set, and crownes on them they make. Great chere in all the chambers wide, of noise the hall it ringes, And tapers toward night they burne hie hangd with golden stringes. And with the light of torches great the darke ofdriue atones. The Queene commaunds a mightie bolle of golde and precious stones To fill with wine, whom Belus king and all king Belus line Was wont to hold, than through them al was silence made by signe. O Ioue, quoth she, for thou of hostes and gestes both great and small Men say the lawes hast put: giue grace I pray, and let vs all Both Moores and also Troians here this day for good be met, That all our offpring after vs this time in ioy may set. Now Bacchus maker of the mirth, good Iuno goddesse deere, And you O Moores go do your best these Troians for to cheere. Thus said she, and whan the grace was done, the boll in hand she sipt, And in the liquor sweet of wine her lips she skantly dipt: But vnto Bitias she it raught with charge, and he anon The fomy bolle of gold vpturnd, and drew till all was gon. Than all the lordes and states about: And on his golden harp Iopas with his bushie locks in sweet song gan to carp, Of stories such as him had taught most mighty Atlas olde. The wandring Moone, and of the Sonne the daily toile he told. Songs of astronomie for princes.How mankind was begoon and beast, wherhence the fier and shoures Proceeds, and how the stars arisen and fallen in certein houres. The waine, the plough stars, &amp; the seuen that storms &amp; t?pest loures. What meanes the sonne that to the seas hee westward hieth so fast In winter daies, and why the nightes so short in sommers wast, The Moores with cries cast vp their hands, so doth the Troians eke, And all that night of them the Queene new talke began to seke. Full oft of Priam would she know, of Hector oft enqueeres, In what aray Aurotas son came in, she gladly heres. What horses Diomedes brought, how great Achilles was Shee learned all to soone, and of long loue she bibbes (alas,) And from the first (quoth she) my gest, vouchsaue I pray to tell The treasons of the Greekes, and how your towne and people fell. And of your chaunce and trauailes all, for thus these seuen yeere About the lands and all the seas thou wandrest as I heere. DEO GRACIAS. Per Thomam Phaer, 25. Maij finitum. Inchoatum 9. eiusdem. 1555. in foresta Kilgerran Southwallie. Opus 11. dierum. THE SECOND BOOKE OF the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. Aeneas at the request of Dido, declareth the destructi? of Troy, which was after this maner. The Greekes in the tenth yeare of their siedge, when their force was quailed, &amp; distrusting their owne abilitie: fel vnto crafts, &amp; subtilties, &amp; co?terfaiting a flight the night before the towne was burned: hid them selues in the Ile of Tenedos, leauing in the Troiane fields a wodden horse of such inesteemable bignesse, that it could not be receaued in at the Citie gates, in whose wombe they had enclosed the most valient souldiers of all their nobilitie. The Troians perswaded partly through the subtiltie of SINON, and partly afraid by LAOCONS punishment: pul downe part of their towne wall, and so bringe in this horse into their Castle. But in the dead time of the night, the Grecians returning from Tenedos, entred into the citie through the same bretch which was made to bring in y? Horse. SINON openeth the wombe of the Horse and letteth foorth the armed men, who immediatly spoyle al with fier, &amp; sword. Whiles these things were doing, Aeneas is warned in his dreame by Hector to prouide for him self by flight, &amp; to delyuer his countrey Gods from the fier. But he preferring an honorable death, before a cowardly flight: in vaine betaketh him to armes, wherin at the first assault the Troians had the vpperhand, vntill, following the counsell of Chorœbus, they put on Greekish armour, and so one of them slew another. Then Priamus pallayce is besieged, and Priamus slaine by Pyrrhus, Achilles sonne. Thus, when Aeneas had assayed all things in vaine, when he was now quite out of hope: betaketh the reliques to his father Anchises, and taking him vp on his shoulders, with Ascanius his sonne, and Creusa his wife: committeth himselfe to flight. The Grætians follow fast after, and in that tumult he lost his wife Creusa, vpon occasion to seeke whom, when as he wandred about all the towne: he met with her ghost, who certified him that she was dead. Hee returnes againe to his companie, whether as now were gathered together a great numbre of men and women, ready to follow him whether so euer he would carie them. They whusted all, and fixt with eies ententiue did behold. Whan Lord Aeneas where he sat from hie benche thus hee told. A doleful worke me to renew (O Queene) y? doost c?strain, To tel how Greekes y? Troian welth, &amp; lam?table raigne Did ouerthrow, which I my selfe haue seene and been a part No small therof, but to declare the stories all: what hart Can of the Greekes or soldiour one of all Vlisses rout Refraine to weepe? and now the night with hie heauen goth about, And on the skies the falling stars doo men prouoke to rest: But if such great desier to know, such longing haue your brest Of Troy the latter toyle to here, to speake or yet to thinke For all that it my minde abhors, and sorows make mee shrinke: I will begin. Forsaken of Gods, and tierd with warres at last, The Lords of Greekes, whan all in vaine so many yeeres had past, A Horse of tree by Pallas art most like a Mount they frame With timber bourds, and for a vow to leaue they blow the fame. Pallas goddesse of wisd?e &amp; inu?ti?, whom y? Greekes &amp; Troians did honor There is an yle in sight of Troy and Tenedos it hight, A welthy land while Priams state and kingdome stood vpright, But now a bay, and harber bad for ships to lie at roade, To that they went, and hid them close that none was seene abroade. Wee thought them gon, and with the winde to Greece to haue been fled. Therfore all Troy for ease of labours long, abroad them spred, With open gates they ronne to sport, and Greekish campes to see, And places long of souldiours kept wherof they now be free. Here lay the men of Dolop land, here fearce Achilles fought, Here stood their ships, and here to trie were wont the armies stout, Some gazed at the straungy gift that there to Pallas stood, And wondred at the Horse so great: and furst for councell good, Tymetes straight would into towne and market haue it brought, God wote if craft or whither so of Troy the fortune wrought. But Capis and a few beside that wiser were of skill, Bad throw the treasons of the Greekes and giftes suspected yll Into the seas, or with a fier ymade to burne outright, Or hew the ribs and serche within what thing yhid be might, The commons into sundry wits deuided were and stood, Till from the town Laocon came in hast as hee were wood, And after him a number great, and ere they gan to throng Hee cried, O wretched citizens, what rage is you among? Beleeue ye gone the Greekes? or do you thinke that any giftes Of them be good? so know you well that false Vlisses driftes? In this tree (for my life) is hid of Greekes an hideous rout, Or this is but an engin made to skale our walles without: And sodenly to slip them downe and on the citie fall, Or other worse deuise there is, take heede ye know not all. What euer it is, I feare the Greekes, and trust their gifts as small. Hee said, and with a corage good his mighty speare hee driues Against the side beneth his ribs, that where it hits it cliues. It shakes aloft, and still it stood that through the belly round The vautes within and crooked caues of noise did all rebound. And if the will of gods had not, had not our hartes ben blinde: Ynough was don all vp to breake, and all the craft to finde, And Troy y? shouldst haue stond as yet, &amp; Priams toures haue shinde. Caused him selfe of purpose to be taken.Behold the shepherds in this while a yongman haue ycaught, And piniond with his hands behinde vnto the king him braught. That for the nonce had done him selfe by yelding to be take To compasse this, and to the Greekes, Troy open wide to make. A fellow slie, and stout of minde, and bent in both to trie, To win by guile, or if he faile, with certeine death to die. On euery side about him drew the Troian youth to see, And some of them to skorne him gan, but now take heede to mee: You shall perceiue the treasons false of Greekes, and of this one, Coniecture all. For as vnarmed in the mids all vexed there hee stoode, And with his eies on Troian men did looke with piteous moode: Sinons lamentaci?.Alas (quoth hee) what gruond may mee, what sea may mee receiue? What shal I caitif miser doo? what hope may I conceiue? That neither with the Greekes dare bide, and now the Troians heere, (As worthy is) my blood to shed for vengeance do requeere. With mourning thus our mindes gan turne, our force we left alone And bad him tell what man hee was, what ment hee thus to mone, What newes he had he should expresse, and forth his minde to breake. Hee at the last set feare a side, and thus began to speake. All thing (quoth hee) O king, what euer it is I will confesse, Nor mee a Greeke I can denie among them borne doutlesse. A fine dessimuler.This first: for though that fortune fals hath Sinon captiue brought, Yet lier shal she neuer make, nor faine or flatter ought. In speech if euer to your eares the name of Palamede Hath come, and of the glory great that of his fame did sprede. Whom by a treason false the Greekes in spite by wicked law Ungiltie did condempne (alas) for hee from war did draw, To death him put, and now him dead they morne to haue againe. His squier, I was and kinsman neere, my father (to be plaine) He toke vp? him to bee kinsman to Palamedes a Grecian y? always did fauour the Troians, To him for pouertie mee put in armes my youth to frame, Whiles yet his kingdome stood [illeg.]wight and (truth to say) some name And honor eke wee bare with men: but whan through false enuie The wicked wretch Vlisses had betraid and done him die: For wo my life in corners darke, and wailing forth I drew, Lamenting sore the fall of mine vngilty freend so trew. And foole I could not hold my peace, but if that fortune serued, If euer to my countrey come I might, as hee deserued, With him I threatned to be quite, and great things did I crake. Here was the cause of all my wo, this did Vlisses make New crimes against me to inuent, and cause mee be suspect To all the campe, as one by Troy of treason than infect, Nor would not rest till Calchas had by his vngracious wit, But what do I reherse these things to shew that be not fit? If all the Greekes in one estate you hate, if I it wist It is ynough: you haue mee here, take vengeance if you list, Vlisses and Atridas twaine great goods for that would spend. Than kindled be wee more to know the circumstance and end, Not thinking of so great a craft, and Greekes deuise so fell. All trembling on his tale hee goth with fained hart to tell. Full oft the Greekes would haue bene gon, and Troy haue left at last, For wery of the war they were, that long in vaine had past. And gon they had, but often times rough seas, and cruell tide, And winter storme, and sotherne winde them staied and made to bide. But chiefly whan this timber horse was raised and stood on ground, Such noise among the clouds was hard that all the skies did sound. Euripilus to Phœbus straight for councell all amaasd Wee sent, and hee returning home this heauy answere blaasd. With blood (O Greekes) ye wan the winds and with a virgin slaine, Whan first the seas to Troy ye tooke, and now through blood againe Agamemnon slew his doughter to haue good winde. Seeke to returne, a Greekish soule for wind you must bestow. That word whan to the commons eares was soone abrode yblow, All men agast, and trembling feare on euery person falles To thinke who now this death should die, and whom Apollo calles. Vlisses here his time espied, and Calchas forth he drew The prophet great, and him before the states of Greekes anew Bad vtter plaine what man it was Apollo so desierd. And here and there men murmurd mee: for priuily enspierd, Men smeld the compasse of this wretch, and some me warning sent. Ten daies in silence Calcas was and seemed not content, That by his tale should any man to cruell death be drest: Till at the last Vlisses cries him forst withouten rest As couenaunt was, with open voyce, and mee to death they name. All men agreed, for of him selfe eche one did feare the same, And to be sure with glad assent they all cried out on mee. And now the day was neere at hand whan offred I should bee. The garlands on my head were set, and frutes (as vsage is.) From death my self I drew, and brake my bonds I knowledge this, And in a slimy lake of mud all night lay hid in wose, Till they were past and vnder saile, I durst me not disclose. And now my natiue contrey deere for euer haue I lost, Nor see my children sweet I shall, nor father loued most, Whom they perhaps for mine escape all giltles put to paine, And with the death of them poore soules this fault redeeme againe. That I thee, by the mighty gods, and heauen that truth doth heare, By (if there doth among mankinde remaine yet any where) Unfained faith: (O king I pray) haue mercy on mine estate, Relieue my woo whom cares oppresse that all men kindly hate. Than pardon wee for pitie gaue, this wailing smartes vs so, King Priam first his men commaunds to vnbind him free to go. What euer thou art forget the Greekes, from hence y? neede not care, Thou shalt be ours, and now the truth of my request declare. What meane they by this monster big, this horse who did inuent? Wherfore? religion sake? or for the warres some engin bent? Thus said: and he with Greekish wiles and treasons fals yfreight, His loosed hands to heauen aboue with great cry held on height. O euerlasting fiers of god, whose wrath no wight can beare, You altars, and you swords also (whose force I fled) I sweare, And you to witnes now I call, and by the garlandes gay That like a beast to slaughter brought (quoth he) I bare that day: Not by my will, I am compeld great secretes here to spreade, Not by my will my countrey I hate, but since their cruell deede Hath forst mee thus, it lawfull is, all gods me pardon shall, Though mystries hie whom they conceale, I blaze and vtter all. Thou Troy therfore (which I preserue) with like faith saue thou mee, Performe thy word, if treasures great, great fortune bring I thee. The hope of Greekes and comfort all since first the war began, In Pallas ayde was euer set, and not in vaine, till whan Titides, and of mischief all the father Vlisses, had By treason Pallas temple take, by night like people mad. They slew the watch, and in they brake, and all with blood embrued. Away they brought with sinfull hands her signe with blisse endued. From that day forth good fortune flew, nothing to minde ensues, No hope ne force they finde, the goddesse quite doth them refuse. Nor by no doubtfull signes of wrath them Pallas did affright, For skant her ymage to the campe was brought, and there ypight: A fliyng flame from out her eyes vpstart, and ouer all Her body ran with swet, and from the ground (wee wondred all) Three times alone she leapt, and thrise her sheeld and speare she shooke. Anon to flight, and to the seas bids Calcas men to looke. This hope is lost (quoth he) by Greekes shall Troy not now be teard, But least this goddesse from our campe they fetche, is to be feard. And now that to their contrey land the long seas haue they past: Tis but a wile, for there a new their godes to win they cast, Some time they caried their ydols to y? warres. And with a fresh force gods and men, whan winde may serue to driue, All vnaware anew they come, thus Calcas can contriue. And for amends to Pallas wrath so vext with sore offence: By visions warnd this ymage here they set ere they went hence, But it so huge in timber worke, so nere the skies to lift, For feare of you did Calcas make, for this was Calcas drift: That to your town, ne through your gates ye might it not receaue, Nor yet the people worship should, but Pallas honours leaue. For if by chaunce ye should attempt this gift of hers defile: Destruction great and long (the god on his head whelme therwhile) Withouten doubt on Priams blood, and all his empier falles. But if by your deuotion great it had stand on your walles: All Greekes should for your fortune quake, and conquests far and wide Ye should obtaine, and wee and ours those destnies must abide. By this deceit, and through the craft of Sinon false periewrd, This to beleeue vs falshood taught, and wee with teares allewrd, Pitie destroied them. Whom neither all Titides force, nor fearce Achilles fame, Not ten yeres war, nor yet of Greekes a thousand ships could tame. An other monster worse than this, and worse to dread, our eies Amazed made, and quite from doubt confounds our harts so wise. For as by chaunce that time a priest to Neptune chosen new, Laocoon a mighty bull on the offring altar slew: Behold from Tenedos aloofe in calme seas through the deepe Laocon y? smote the Horse was killed with his children by serpents.(I quake to tell) two serpents great with foldings great do sweepe. And side by side in dragons wise, to those their way they make. Their heads aboue the stream they hold, their fiered manes they shake, The salt sea waues before them fast they shouen, and after trailes Their vgly backes, and long in links behind them drag their tailes. With rushing noise the fome vpsprings, and now to land they past With blood red lookes, and glistring fiers their sparckling eies out cast, Where hissing out with spirting tongs their mouths they lickt for yre. Wee dead almost for feare do flee, they straight with one desier On Lacon set, and first in sight his tender children twaine Eche one they tooke, and winding wraps their tender lims to straine, And gnawing them with greedy mouthes (poore wretches) fed they fast. Than hee him selfe to their defence with drawn sword making hast, In holde they caught, and wrething gript his body about at twise, And twise his throte with rolles they girt themselues in compas wise, And than their heads and skalebright neckes him ouer aloft they lift. Wh? fr? their knots himself to ontwine, with hands he sought to shift, Their poisons rancke al ouer him ronnes, and lothsom filth out flies. Therwith a grisly noise he castes, that mounts vp to the skies. Likewise as from the mortall stroke some wounded bull at stake, The slaughtring axe hath fled by chance, and roaring loud doth make. But they anone the dragons twaine all gliding swift they leapt, And to the goddesse sacred seat in Pallas temple crept, There vnderneth her sheeld and feete they couching close them kept. Than trembling feare through al our harts was spred, &amp; wonder new Wee thinke how Lacoon for sinne was paid with vengeance dewe, For hurting of that holy gift, whom he with cursed speare Assailed had, and worthy was (men said) that plage to beare. Bring in the holy horse they crie, this goddesse wrath to appeas, They op[illeg.] their walles to bring in the horse.And her of mercy great beseeke. Than wide abroad we breake the wals, alway through them we make. With corage all men fall to worke, some sort doth vndertake, His feete on sliding wheeles to slip, some thwart his necke begin The cables bind, and on the walles now climes the fatall ginne With armour fraight, about him runnes of boyes and girles the skull With songs and himpnes, and glad goth he that hand may put to pull. It enters, and a front the towne it slides with thretning sight. O countrey soile? O house of gods? thou Ilion, O the might Of doughty Troian walles in war, for there foure times a ground It swaied, &amp; four times through the wombe was harneis hard to sound. Yet we went on, and blind with rage our worke we would not let, But in this cursed monster brought, by Pallas tower to set. Than prophecies aloud to preach Cassandra nothing spares Cassandra a prophetesse, doughter to king Priam. As god enspired, but neuer of vs beleeued who nothing cares. And wretches wee that neuer day beside that day should bide, The temples strowd, and through the town great feasting made y? tide. This while the firmament doth turne, and darke night vp doth rise, And ouerhides with shadow great both londs, and seas, and skies, And falshed of the Greekes withall: and now along the walles The weery Troians laid at rest, the dead sleepe on them falles. Whan with their fleete in goodly aray the Greekish armies soone From Tenedos were come (for than full freendly shone the Moone) In silence great their wonted shore they tooke, and than a flame Their Amral ship for warning shewed, whan kept all gods to shame Sir Sinon out by stelth him stirs, and wide he sets abrode His horses paunch, and he disclosed straight laith out his lode, Thersander, Stelenus, and false Vlisses, captaines all, And Athamas, and Thoas eke, by long ropes downe they fall. Neptolemus Achilles broode, Machaon chiefe of pride, And Menelae with numbers moe full gladly forth they slide. And hee him selfe Epeus there this mischiefe first that found, The inuenter of the horse was in it him selfe. The towne inuade they do forthwith, in sleepes and drinking drownd. They slew the watch, and than the gates broad vp they breke, &amp; stands Their fellowes ready to receiue, and thicke they ioyne their bands. That time it was, whan slumber first and dead slepe deepe opprest On wery mortall men doth creepe, through gods gift sweete at rest. Midnight. Unto my sight (as dreame I did) all sad with dolefull cheere Did Hector stand, and large him weepe with sobs I might wel heere, With horses haled, as blooddy drawn sometime he was in dust, And all to swolne his worthy feete where through y? thongs wer thrust. Alas to thinke how sore beraied, how from that Hector sore He chaunged was, that in Achilles spoyles came home before, Or whan among the ships of Greece the fiers so fierce he flonge. But now in dust his beard bedaubd, his hear with blood is clonge. With naked woundes, that in defence of Troiane walls sustainde Hee often had: and mee to weepe for pity woo constrainde, Aeneas to Hector in vision.With heauy voice me thought I spake, and thus to him I plaind. O light of Troy, O Troian hope at neede that neuer failde, What contrey thee so long hath kept? what cause hath so preuailde? That after slaughters great of men, thy towne, thy people tierd, With sondry paines and daungers past, thee long (so sore desierd) At last we see? what chaunce vnkind thy face before so bright Hath made so foule alas? and why of woundes I see this sight? He nothing hereto spake, nor mee with vaine talke long delayed, But heauy from his brest hee fet his deepe sight, than he said. Flee flee thou goddesse sonne, alas, thy selfe saue from these flames, The walls are won (quoth he) the Greekes of Troy pul down y? frames. For Priam and our contrey deere our duety is don, if hand Or mans reliefe might Troy haue kept, by this hand had it stand. And now religions all to thee with Goddes doth Troy betake, New fortune thou and they must seeke: thou vnto them shalt make More mighty wals, wh? through the seas long iourneis hast y? take. So said, and with his hands me thought he from their altars drewe The mighty gods, and all their fiers aye lasting out he threw. By this time diuers noyse abroad through al the town is steerd, And wailinges loude, and more and more on euery side appeerd. And though my father Anchises house with trees encompast round Stood far within, yet brim we heare the noyse, and armours sound. Therwith I wooke, and vp the towre I clymbe by staires on hie. And laied myne eare, and still I stood about me round to spie. And euen as fier in boystrous wind some contrey ripe of corne Doth burne, or as a mountaine flood with great force down hath borne The grain, y? grasse, the toyle of men y? plowes &amp; beasts haue wrought, And trees it hedlong drawes withall, for stones it forceth nought, The plowman wayling from the rocke beholds and heares the sound: Right so this wofull sight I saw; and Greekish treasons found. And now the great house downe was falne by fier that wild doth flie Of Deiphobus furst, and next, his neyghbour burnes on hie Vcalegon, and shores and strondes with blasings shines about. And shriking shoutes of people rise, and Trompets blowen are out. Amazed I mine armour tooke, nor what to doo I wust, But hedlong ran, and through the throngs to fight I thought to thrust. And to the castleward I hied more aide to call mee nie. With anger wood, and faier me thought in armes it was to die. Behold where skaping from the Greekes, &amp; through their weap?s past Doth Panthus ronne, that of the towre was Phœbus preest, and fast His relikes with his conquerd gods hee bare, and him beside, His Neuew smal hee haling drew, and swift to shoreward hied. Panthus? where goth y? worst? what shift? what towre is best we take? Skant had I said, whan hee all straught in cries this voice out brake. Our vtter houre is comen alas, fell destnies death hath brought. We haue ben Troyes whan Ilion was, our glories great to nought The spiteful gods haue ouerturnd our pompe, our town, our toures, The city burnes, and who but Greekes are lords of vs and oures. The hougy horse abrode his men in harneis poureth out, And Sinon ouer all triumphes, and fiers he throweth about With conquest wide, and euery gate is fild with peoples armde, With thousands such as out of Greece so thicke they neuer swarmde: The straites in euery streat they keepe, the waies with wepons pight, And stout in rankes they stond with steele fast bent to death in fight: Skant doth the watche that keepe the towres, resist with feeble might. This whan I heard, no lenger hold my selfe I could, but right Into the flames and weapons flew, where most resembling hell Men roaring made, and where with cries to heauen the people yell. Than Ripheus him selfe adioynd, and mighty most with launce Came Iphitus vnto my side, by moonelight met by chaunce. And Hipanis, and Dimas eke, and about mee flocke they more, With yong Chorœb duke Migdons son, that few daies than before To Troy was come, Cassandras loue with woode desier to win, And socour than for Priam brought to assist her Troian kin. Unhappy man, that what his spouse him rauing told in traunce, Would not regard. Whom as I saw to battel bent, thus bold mee clustre about: Aeneas to his c?pany about him. I thus began, O lusty youth of valiant hartes and stout, In vaine, if into daungers most attempting after mee You minde to run, the state of things and fortune here ye see: The temples left and seates alone, and altars quite forsake, The Gods wherby this empier stood are gon, you vndertake A citie burnt to seeke to saue, what shall we doo? but die Like men, and in the mids of armes and wepons let vs flie. One chiefe reliefe to conquerd men is desperatly to trie. Whan this the yong men heard me speake, of wild they waxed wood, And than like wolues whom hunger driues to rauine for their food, In cloudy mistes abroad to raunge, their whelpes with hungry iawes Them bides at home, and they for rage do run to feede their mawes. Euen so through thick and thin we flang, through foes &amp; wepons pight To doubtles death, right through the streetes encompast all with night. Who can the slaughters of that night with tong declare? or who With worthy teares can tell the toyle that death men draue vnto? The citie falth, that auncient long and many a yeere the crowne Hath borne, and euery street is strowed with bodies beaten downe, And heapes in euery house there lieth, and temples all are filde With bodies dead, and not alone the Troians poore are kilde. Somtime when tirid ben their harts their manful stomacks steeres, And downe their conquerours they quell, on euery side appeeres The fearfull dreed, and wailing wide, and face of death at hand. There furst against vs of the Greekes with men a mighty band Androgeos vs met, and thought his contreymen we were, Androgeos a Greeke.All on aware, and like a freend he cald vs void of feare. Set forwards sirs: what trifling thus so long you linger makes? Whan other men the burning towne doth sacke, our fellowes takes The spoyls of Troy while you for slouth scant from your ships can pas. He said, and straight (for answere none that liked him giuen ther was) All sodenly amids his foes him selfe betrapt he knew, He shranke therwith, and stopt his tale, and foote he backward drew, As one that vnbethought hath hapt some snake among the briers To tread, and quickly sterting backe with trembling feare retiers, Whan swolne with angry teene he seeth his blew necke bent vpright. So quaking whan Androgeos vs spied, he tooke his flight. But we pursued, and thicke with armes them all encompast round On euery side, and them affraied (and nothing knew the ground) We ouerthrew, and fortunes lucke our first assay succeedes. Yong[illeg.]? proud of the first good luckFor ioy wherof, triumphing fierce Chorœbus nothing dreedes, Now mates (quoth he) where fortune first hath shewed reliefe, &amp; where Our valiant hands our aide hath wel begoon, proceed we there. And let vs chaunge our sheeldes with Greekes, &amp; armd in Greekes aray Let vs set on, what skilles it force or falshood enmies slay? Our enemies lo their wepons yeeldes against them selues to fight, So sayd, and on his head he puts Androgeos helmet bright, And with his gorgeous sheeld him selfe he clad full gay to beare, And on his side the Greekish sworde hee comly gyrt did weare. So Ripheus, so Dymas doth him selfe, and therwithall Policy in apara?ce The youth of Troy w? Greekish spoiles them deckes both great &amp; small. Than mixt among the Greekes we gon, our selues vs doth not gyde, God led them. And many a skirmish sore that night we blindly fought and tryde. And many a Greeks to Hell we sent, some other away for feare To shipboard ran, and some to shores with coursing here and there. Some foule afrayed their hougy horse agayn do clime, and take Their wonted seates, &amp; in his paunche their harbrow old they make. Alas, what may mankinde preuaile whan gods him doth forsake? Behold, where haeld by heare and head from Pallas temple sure, King Priams doughter drawen we see Cassandra virgin pure. And vp to heauen in vaine for helpe her glistring eyes she cast, Her eyes: for than her tender hands with boltes were fettred fast. That sight Chorœbus raging wood could not him hold to see, But euen among the mids he lept, with will to die, and wee Him after sued, and thicke in throngs of armes our selues wee thurst. Passion of loue &amp; wrath. There from the temples top aloft, with Troians weapons furst Our own men vs did whelm, where doth most piteous slaughter rise, Our armours fals mistake, and Greekish sheeldes deceiued their eyes. Than all the Greekes whan from them take the virgin was, for yre Craft hath yll ende. By flockes on euery side with cries inuade as wilde as fyre. Atridas twaine, and Aiax chiefe, and egre in armies stout, And after them their battayles all, and youth of Dolop rout. None otherwise than whan somtime the whirlewinds out are brast, And sondry stormes from sondry coasts are met, and strugling fast, Conflicts, both east, &amp; west, and south, that woods with cracking quakes, And Neptunes forke the fomy seas from bottoms wild vp rakes. And they also whom through the darke, that night wee chasyd had, And ouercame by chaunce before: they first with corage glad Appeard in sight, and first our sheeldes and armours fals eskried. They knew, and marking by our soundes our seuerall tongs espied, There downe by heapes the numbre vs threw, Chorœbus first of all At mighty Pallas sent of Peneleus hand doth fall. Gods wil must be don.And fall doth Ripheus to ground, the iustest man that was Of Troian kinde, and one that most of right and law did pas. But god of them did otherwise than dispose: and them beside, Both Hipanis, and Dimas eke were lost and slaine that tide. Their own men through them wepons threw, nor thee O Panthus pure Thy vertues great, nor Phœbus crowne, from death could than assure. Yet by the flames extreme I swere that all Troy brought to dust, At your decayes I witnes take (if trueth protest I must) I neuer man ne wepon shund of Greekes, ne from you swarued, If gods will were, my death I sought, and sure my hand deserued. Than out we brake both Iphitus and I, and Pelias kinde, The gret assault at the kings palaisThe one for age, the other Vlisses wound made come behinde. And by the cries to Priams court our king forth with enclinde. There now the battaile great was vp, as if no place els where Had felt of war, as die did none through all the towne but there. So raging Mars and Greekes vp run to houses tops wee see, And postes puld downe and gates vp broake beset, that none should flee. The walles with scaling ladders laide, and stulps of scaffolds hie, And vp by staires they clyme, and backe they driue the dartes that flie With sheeldes: and battilmentes aboue in handes they catche and hold. Against them Troians down the towres and tops of houses rold, And rafters vp they reaue, and after all attemptes, at last Those fooles for shift at death extreame, to fend them selues they cast. The golden beames, their auncient fathers frames of comely sight They tombled downe, some other alow with wepons pointed bright At gates and euery dore doth warde, and thicke in rancks they stand. Anon the pallais of our king to helpe wee tooke in hand, Our aid to put, and adde reliefe to men with labours spent. A wall there was, and through the same by postern gate there went An entry blinde, that secret serued Priams lodgings wide. Wherthrough somtime whan yet in state their kingdomes did abide, Full oft Andromache was woont her selfe alone to passe Andromache was Hectors wife.Unto the kinge and Queene her father and mother in law that was, And young Astianax her childe his graunsier to shee brought. Therthrough I skope, and vp the tops of houses hie I past, Where downe the sely Troians darts in vaine for fainting cast. A towre that steepe vpright did stand and hie to skies vp reard Aboue the roofes from whence all Troy full broad in sight appeard, And whence the ships and campes of Greekes &amp; tentes in times of wars Men wonted were to vew, that towre with ginnes and mighty bars Wee vnderheaued, and where the ioyntes and timber beames it bound, Beneth together at once we lift, at last it lose from ground We shogd, and with the shog for heft, with ratling noyse and fall Downe ouer along the Greekes it light, and far and wide withall Great slaughter makes, but other vpsteps for th?, nor stones this while, Nor kindes of wepons cease theron. Before the porch all ramping first at thentry dore doth stand Duke Pyrrhus in his brasen harneis bright with burnisht brand. Pirrhus y? sonne of Achilles. And glistring like a serpent shines whom poisoned weedes hath fild, That lurking long hath vnder ground in winter cold ben hild. And now his cote of cast all fresh with youth renewd and pride Upright his head doth hold, and swift with wallowing backe doth glide Bresthigh against the sunne, and spits with toongs thre forked fier. And hugy Periphas with him, with him Achilles squier Antomedon, his maisters steedes that wonted was to chace. Than all the youth of Scyrie land ensues, and to the place They enter thicke, and fiers about on houses hie they fling. Him selfe in hand among the cheefe a twyble great doth bring, And ther withall he through the gates and doores with dints doth driue, And downe the brasen postes doth pull and timber plancks doth cliue. And now the bars a sonder brast, and ioystes vp hewed doth fall, An entry broad, and window wide is made now through the wall. There houses far within appeares and hals are laid in light, Aperes king Priams parlours great that auncient kings had dight. And harneyst men they see to stand at thentry doores to fight. But the inner lodgings all with noise and woful wailing soundes, A wonderful briefe description of a city inuaded. With bounsing thick and larums lowd the buildings all rebounds. And howling women shoutes, and cries the golden stars do smite. Th? w?dring here &amp; there w? dreed through chambers wide affright, The mothers clip their contrey postes, and kissing hold with might. But Pirrhus with his fathers force on preaseth, neither walles Nor keepers him therout can hold, with rammes and engins falles The portall postes and thresholds vp are throwen &amp; doores of halles. Than forceing foorth they shooue, &amp; through they push, &amp; down they kill Them first that meetes, and euery floore with souldiours fast they fill, Not half so ferce the fomy flood whose rampier bankes are torne With rage outronnes, whan diches thwart and piers are ouerborne With waues, and forth on feelds it fals, and waltring downe the vales, And houses down it beares withall, and heardes of beastes it hales. Neptolemus my selfe I saw, with slaughters wood to rage, And brethren twayn Atridas ferce, theyr furies none could swage. Queene Hecuba and her hundred doughter lawes, and Priam there With blood I saw defile the fiers, him selfe to god did rere. And fifty paramours he had, and childrens yssewe, told No nomber lesse: the stately spoyles and postes full proude of gold Abroad are thrown, and what y? fier doth leaue the Greekes doth hold. The fatall end of Priam now perhaps you will requier. Whan hee the citie taken saw and houses tops on fier, And buildings broke, and round about so thicke his foes to rage, His harneis on his shoulders (long on worn till than) for age All quaking, on (good man) hee puts, to purpose small, and than His sword him gyrt, and into death and enmies thicke he ran. Amids the court right vnderneth the naked skies in sight, An altar huge of sise there stoode, and by the same vpright An auncient Laurell tree did grow, that wide abroad was shed, And it, and all the caruyd gods with broade shade ouerspred. There Hecuba and her doughters all (poore soules) at the altars side In heapes together affrayd them drew, like doues whan doth betide Some storme them headlong driue, and clipping fast their gods did hold But whan shee Priam thus be clad in armes of youth so bold Espied: what minde alas (quoth she) O wofull husband you In harneis dight: and whither away with wepons run ye now? Not men nor wepons vs can saue: this time doth are to beare. No such defence, no not if Hector mine now present were. Stand here by mee, this altar vs from slaughters all shal shelde, Or die together at ones we shall. So said she, and gan to welde Him aged man, and in the sacred seat him set, and helde. Behold where skaping from the stroke of Pirrhus fers in fight Polites, one of Priams sonnes, through foes and wepons pight, Through galeries along doth run, and wide about him spies Sore wounded than, but Pirrhus after him sues with burning eyes In chase, and now wel nere in hand him caught and held with spere, Till right before his parents sight he came, than feld him there To death, and with his gushing blood his life outright he shed. There Priamus, though now for wo that time he halfe was dead, Him selfe could not refraine, nor yet his voice nor anger holde. But, vnto thee (O wretch) he cried, for this despite so bolde, The gods (if any iustice dwels in heauen or right regard) Do yeeld thee worthy thankes, and thee do pay thy due reward, That here within my sight my son hast slaine with slaughter vyle, And not ashamd with lothsome death his fathers face to fyle. Not so did hee (whom falsly thou beliest to be thy sier) Achilles with his enmie Priam deale, but my desier Whan Hectors corps to tombe he gaue for golde, did entertaine With truth and right, and to my realme restorde me safe againe. So spake, and therwithall his dart with feeble force hee threw, Which sounding on his brasen harneis hoarce, it backward flew, And on his targat side it hit, where dintlesse downe it hing. Than Pirrhus said, thou shalt go now therfore and tidinges bring Unto my father Achilles soule, my dolefull deedes to tell. Neptolemus his bastard is, not I, say this in hell. Neptolemus and Pyrrhus were brethren. Now die, and (as he spake that word) from the altar selfe he drew Him trembling there, and deepe him through his sons blood did embrue. And with his left hand wrapt his lockes, w? right hand through his side His glistring sworde outdrawen, he did hard to the hiltes to glide. This ende had Priams destnies all, this chaunce him fortune sent, Whan he the fier in Troy had seene, his walles and castels rent, That somtime ouer peoples proud, and lands had reingd with fame Of Asia emprour great, now short on shore he lieth with shame, His head besides his shoulders laid, his corps no more of name. Than first the cruell feare mee caught, and sore my sprites appalde, And on my father deere I thought, his face to minde I calde: Whan slaine with grisly wound our king, him like of age in sight Lay gasping dead, and of my wife Creusa bethought the plight. Alone, forsake, my house dispoild, my childe what chaunce had take I looked, and about mee vewd what strength I might me make. All men had mee forsake for paines, and downe their bodies drew To ground they leapt, and some for wo them selfs in fiers they threw. And now alone was left but I, whan Vestas temple staier To keepe, and secretly to lurke all couching close in chaier Dame Helen y? was cause of al this war and slaughter Helen I might see to sit, bright burnings gaue mee light Where euer I went, the waies I past, all thing was set in sight. Shee fearing her the Troians wrath, for Troy destroid to wreke, Greekes turments, and her husbands force whose wedlack she did breke, The plage of Troy, and of her contrey monster most vntame: There sat she with her hatyd head, by the altars hid for shame. Straight in my brest I felt a fier, deepe wrath my hart did straine My contreis fall to wreke, and bring that cursed wretch to paine. What shall shee? into her contrey soile of Sparta, and hie Micene? All safe shall shee returne? and there on Troy triumphe as Queene? Her husband, children, contrey, kin, her house, her parents old With Troian wiues and Troian lordes, her slaues, shal she beholde? Was Priam slaine with sworde for this? Troy burnt with fier so wood, Is it herefore that Dardan strondes so oft haue swet with blood? Not so: for though it be no praise on woman kinde to wreke, And honour none there lieth in this, nor name for men to speke, Yet quench I shall this poison here, and due desertes to dight. Men shall commend my zeal, and ease my minde I shall outright. This much for all my peoples bones, and contrey flames to quite. Venus letted him to kill Helene.These things within my selfe I tost, and fierce with force I ran. Whan to my face my mother great, so brim no time till than Appearing shewed her selfe in sight, all shining pure by night, Right goddesse like, with glory such as heauens beholdes her bright. So great with maiestie shee stood, and mee (by right hand take) She staied, and red as rose with mouth these words to mee she spake. My son, what sore outrage so wilde thy wrathful minde vp steeres? Why fretst thou? or where away thy care from vs withdrawn apeeres? Not first vnto thy father seest? whom feeble in all this wo Thou hast forsake? nor if thy wife doth liue thou knowest, or no, Nor yong Ascanius thy childe? whom thronges of Greekes about Doth swarming run, and were not my reliefe, withouten doubt By this time flames had vp deuourd, or swordes of enmies kilde. It is not Helens face of Greece this towne (my son) hath spilde, Nor Paris is to blame for this: but gods with grace onkinde, This welth hath ouerthrowne, and Troy from top to ground ontwinde. Behold, (for now away the cloud and dym fog will I take That ouer mortall eies doth hang, and blind thy sight doth make) Thou to thy parents heast take heede (dread not) my minde obey. In yonder place where stones from stones, and bildings huge to swey Thou seest, &amp; mixt with dust and smoke thicke streames of reekings rise: Himself the God Neptune that side doth turne in wonders wise With forcke thretinde the walles vprootes, foundations all to shakes, And quite from vnder soil the town with ground workes all vp rakes. On yonder side with furies most dame Iuno fiercely standes, The gates she keepes, &amp; from their ships the Greekes her frendly bands In armour gyrt she calles. Lo there againe where Pallas sits on fortes and castle towres, With Gorgons eies in lightning cloudes inclosed grim she loures. Gorgon was a monster, that kilde men with looking only. The father god him selfe to Greekes their mightes and courage steres Him selfe against the Troian blood, both gods and armour reres. Betake thee to thy flight (my son) thy labours end procure, I will thee neuer faile, but thee to resting place assure. Thus said she, &amp; through the darke night shade her selfe shee drew from sight. Appeares the grisly faces than, Troys enmies vgly dight The mighty powers of Gods. Than verily right broad I saw whole Ilion castles sinke In fiers, and vpsodown all Troy from botom turne to brinke. And like as on the mountaine top, some auncient oke to fall The plowmen with their axes strong do striue, and twibles tall To grub, and round about hath hewd: it thretning from aboue Doth nod, and with the braunches wide al trembling bends to moue, Till ouercome with strokes at last, all cracking down to fall, One wound it ouerthrowes, and ground it drawes and rockes with all. Than down I went as god me led through flames and foes to trie. All weapons as I pas, giue place, and flames away do flie. But whan into my fathers mansion house I came, and there Him first I thought to shift, and vp the mountaines next to bere: His father wold not flee. My father after Troy destroied no longer life desiers, Nor outlaw would he none become. O you whose youth requiers To liue, and blood in lust vpholds (quoth he) your limmes to weelde Take you your flight. For as for mee, if Gods aboue would life haue had me led, This place they would haue kept mee: ynough to much, and ouerhed Of slaughters haue wee seene, our citie brent we do suruiue. Go foorth, let me remaine (I pray) for mee do you not striue. Mine owne hand shal my death obtein, my foe will rue my plight, My corps he can but spoyle, for of a graue the losse is light. This many a yere to Gods abhord vnweldy life I finde, Since time whan mee the father of Gods and king of all mankinde Anchises was striken with lightning in his youth.Beblasted with his lightning winde, and fiers on me did cast. Thus spake hee, and in his purpose still he fixt remained fast. Wee theragainst with streaming teares, my wife also shee stood, Ascanius, and our houshold all, we praied that in that mood All things with him good father turne he nold, nor slaughter make Outright of all, nor vs to death and destnies fell betake. Hee still denied, and stif his minde nor purpose would forsake. Againe to wepons fourth I flew, and death most miser call, For counsell what? or what reliefe, or fortune now can fall? Thinke you that I one foote from hence, you father left behinde Can pas? or may there such a sin escape your mouth vnkinde? If nothing of so great a towne to leaue the Gods be bent, And fixt in minde you haue decreed Troys ruines to augment With losse of you and yours, agreed, at this dore death doth stand, And here anon from Priams blood comth Pyrrhus hote at hand, That children in their fathers sight, and father on the altar killes. For this O mighty mother mine, through fiers and foes and billes Haue you mee kept till now for this? that in my parlour flores Mine enmies I must see to kill my folkes within my dores? Ascanius my childe? my wife Creusa? my father olde? All sprauling slaine with blood in blood embrued shal I beholde? Weapons seruaunts, bring mee wepons, our last houre doth vs call, And yeeld mee among the Greekes to fight, let me to battails fall Afresh, for neuer shall wee die this day vnuenged all. Than mee with sword againe I girt, my left arme vnder sheeld I put, and out at dores I ran with rage to fight in feelde. Behold at thentry gate my wife, embracing both my feete, A pitiful meeting.Doth kneele, and vp to mee she holdes my childe Ascanius sweete. If toward death thou goest, take vs with thee to chaunces all, If socour ought or hope thou findst in armes, than first of all Defend this house, to whom forsakst thy childe Iule alas? To whom thy father leauest, and mee sometime thy wife that was? Thus wailing al our house shee filde, thus cried she through the halles. Whan sodenly (right woonder great to tell) a monster falles. For euen betweene our hands and right before our face in sight, Beholde, from out Ascanius top a flame ariseth bright, And harmeles lickes his lockes, and soft about his temples feede, A visi? of fier came out of his sons hed. We straight his burning hear gan shake, al tr?bling dead for dreede, And waters on the sacred fiers to quenche anon wee sheede. But than my father Anchises glad, to heauen doth lift his eyes With hands vpthrowne against the stars, and voice exalted cries. Almighty Ioue (if mans respect or praiers doost regard) Behold vs now this ones, and (if our deedes deserue reward) From henceforth father helpe vs send, and blesse this grace with more. Skant from his mouth the word was past, whan skies aloft to rore Begin, and thonder light was thrown, and down from heauen by shade A streaming star descends, and long with great light makes a glade. We looking, brim behold it might, and ouer our house it slips, A token fr? heau? to bid him flee. And forth to Ida woods it went, there downe it selfe it dips, Us pointing out the way to flee, than straking light along Doth shine, and broad about it smokes with sent of sulphur strong. Than straight my father ouercome, him selfe aduauncing welds. And prayeth his gods, and worship to that blessed star he yeelds. Now now no more I let, leade where ye lyst, I wil not swarue. O contrey gods our house behold, my neuew safe preserue. This token yet is yours: yet Troy in your regard remaines. I yeld me son, nor further stay with thee to take all paines. So spake hee, and now about our walles the fiers approching sounds At hand, and nere and nere the flames with feruent rage redounds. Deare father now therfore your selfe set on my necke to beare, My shoulders shall you lift, this labour mee shal nothing deare, What euer chaunce betides, one daunger both wee must abide, In safety both a lyke wee shalbe sure, and by my side My childe Iule shall go, my wife shall trace aloofe behinde. He appointed wher they shal meet. You seruantes what I say take heede, imprint it well in minde. There is a hill whan out the towne ye come, and temple old Of Ceres long vnvsed, there beside ye shall behold An auncient Cipers tree to grow, that for religions sake Our fathers there did set, and there long time did honor make. In that place out of diuers waies wee all shall seeke to meete. You father take your contrey gods in hand, our comfort sweete. Tooke his ymages with him. For mee, that from the battailes fresh am come and slaughters new, I may not them for sin presume to touche, till waters dew With floods hath washt mee pure. Thus said I, and on my shoulders broad and thwart my necke I kest A weede, and in a lions skin ful read my selfe I drest. And vnder burden fast I fled, my childe my right hand kept Iule, and after mee, with pace vnlike in length, he stept. My wife ensued, through lanes and crokes and darknes most we past. Anchises espied enemies comming after.And mee, that late no shoutes, nor cries, nor noyse, nor wepons cast Could feare, nor clusters great of Greeks in throngs agast could make: Now euery winde and puffe doth moue, at euery sound I quake, Not for my selfe, but for my mate, and for my burdens sake, And now against the gates I came, which out of daunger found, I thought I well escaped had, whan sodenly the sound Of feete we heare to tread, and men full thicke my father skand. Flee flee my son (he cried) lo here they come, lo here at hand, Their harneis bright apeares, and glistring sheeldes I see to shine. There what it was I not, some chaunce or God (no freend of mine) Amazed than my wit, for while through thicke and thin I pas, And from the accustomd waies I draw to seke to skape (alas) My wife from mee most wofull man Creusa beloued best, (Remaine she did, or lost her way, or sat her downe to rest, He lost his wife.Onknowen it is) but after that in vaine her all we sought, Nor of her losse I knew, nor backe I looked or bethought: Till vnto Ceres temple old and auncient seate, ech one Was come, and there togethers met wee all, but shee alone Did lacke, and there her freends and childe and husband did begile. What man or god (for anger mad) did I not curse that while? Or what in all that towne vpturnd saw I so sore befall? My father and my childe Iule and Troian gods withall Onto my men I tooke, and in a crooked vale then hidde, Againe vnto the citie gyrt in glistring armes I yede, All chaunces there againe to trie my minde I fixed fast, All Troy for her againe to seeke, my life to daungers cast. First backe vnto the walles and gate I turne, and thentry blinde Where out I came I sought, and steps of feete I marke behinde, Where night to see could serue, and fiers that glistring shines about. Great feare on euery side I see, the silence makes mee doubt, My house at home, if haply there, if haply there she heelde, I went to looke, the Greekes were in, and houses all they filde. Deuouring fier doth all consume, from house to house it flies. The wind encreaseth flames, and vp the rage to heauen doth rise. To Priams court I turne, and to the castle view I cast. The temples great were spoylde, and Iunos holy dores were brast. Amids the flore the keepers stoode, the chiefe of capteines stout, Both Phenix and Vlisses false with them their traine about The pray did keepe, and Greekes to them the Troian riches brought, That from the fiers on euery side was raught; all temples sought And tables from the gods were take, and basons great of gold, And precious plate and robes of kingly state and treasours old, And captiue childern stoode, and trembling wiues in long aray Were stowed about and wept. I ventred eke my voice to lift, and through the glimsing night The waies with cries I fild, and Creusas name full loud I shright. In vaine I cald and cald, and oft againe and yet I cried. Thus seeking long with endles paine and rage, all places tried, At last (with wofull lucke) her sprite and Creusas ghost (alas) Her soule appeared vnto him. Before mine eyes I saw to stand, more great than wonted was. I stoinid, and my heare vpstood, my mouth for feare was fast. She spake also, and thus fro me my cares she gan to cast. What meane you thus your raging minde with labours sore to moue O husband sweete? these things without the powers of gods aboue Hath not betide: mee now from hence to leade, or by your side You shall see neuer more, hee doth resist that heauens doth gyde. Long pilgrimage you haue to pas, huge feelde of seas to eare. Onto Hesperia land you shall ariue do you not feare, Where Tyber flood through fertill soyle of men doth softly slyde. There substance great, and kingdome strong, and Queene to wife beside She prophecied to him of an other wife. You shall enioy, for mee thy Creusa deare do weepe no more. To Mirmidons nor Dolop land shall I not now be bore, Nor to the ladies proud of Greece shall I be seruant seene, Of Dardan and of goddesse Venus doughter law. But mee the mightie mother of gods wil not from hence to moue. And now farewell, and of our childe, for both, kepe thou the loue. Thus whan she said, I weeping there, &amp; more things would haue spoke, She left mee, and with the wind she went as thin from sight as smoke, Three times about her necke I sought mine armes to set, and thrise In vaine her likenes fast I held, for through my hands she flies Like wauering wind, or like to dreames that men ful swift espies, Than to my company at last whan night was gon I drew. And there a multitude of men full huge and number new I found, with maruell much, both men and women yong and old A rable great exylde, and piteous commons to behold From euery coast were come, and with their goods and harts assent, What lond or sea so euer I would them lead they were content. And now from vp the mountaine tops the dawning star doth rise, And brings againe the day, the Greekes (as best they could deuise) The gates possest and held, all hope and helpe was gone: at last I yeelded, and my father tooke, and vp the hill I past. DEO GRACIAS. Per Thomam Phaer, in foresta Kilgerran mense Iulij. Anno. 1555. Opus viginti dierum. THE THIRDE BOOKE OF the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. When Troy was vtterly subuerted, Aeneas hauinge gathered together in flight his company, that remained after the great fier and slaughter, and hauing obtained of Atander a fleete of twenty sayle: arriueth first in Thracia. Wheras, when he began to build a citie, being terrefied through the prodigious tokens of Polydorus y? was slaine by Polymnestor: he departeth to Delos, &amp; there taking counsel of y? Oracle of Apollo, and aduertised that he must go to y? land from whence his auncestors first descended: through the false enterpretation of Anchises his father, arriued in Creta where he began also to lay the foundations of a Citie. And being there afflicted with a great plague of pestilence: was warned by his houshold Gods in his slepe, that he should leaue Creta, and goe to Italy. In which iorney, by a tempest he was driuen to the Ilandes Strophades, and there much troubled by the Harpyes, &amp; shortly after arriuing at Actium: made playes in the honour of Apollo. From thence he sayled by Corcyra into Epyrus, wheras Helenus y? son of Priamus raygned, y? maryed Andromache after the death of Pyrrhus. By whom he was courteously entertained, and admonished of the perils which he should substayne both by sea and land. Fr? thence he sayleth to Tarentum, and passing along by the first shoare of Italy: arriueth on that side that lieth neare to the Mounte Aetna, and there hee receaueth Achæmenides who was left in the Cyclops den by Vlisses: anon from thence he hoyseth sayle as Helenus commaunded, and passeth by Scylla &amp; Carybdis. And coastinge along the shoare of Sycilye taketh land at Drepanus, where Anchises partly weakened by age, and partly by trauaile ended his life. From thence sayling towardes Italy: hee was driuen into Affrike by a tempestous weather raised by Aeolus, as is expressed in the first booke. Whan Asia state was ouerthrowen, and Priams kingdome stout All gitles by the power of gods aboue was rooted out, And downe the fortresse proude was falne that Glorious Ilion hyght, And flat on ground all Neptunes Troy lay smoking broad in sight: To diuers londes and diuers coasts, like outlawd men, compeld By tokens of the Gods we were, to seeke from thence expeld, And vnderneath Antander hill, and mountes of Ida name, In Phrygi lond our nauy great we wrought and vp did frame, Uncertein wherupon to stay, where destnies vs doth gyde, And power of men assembleth fast. Scant sommer first wee spied: Whan sayles onto the windes to set my father Anchises cries. Than parting from my contrey shores and hauens with weeping eies, The feeldes where Troy did stand I leaue, forth outlaw fare I right, My son my mates &amp; frends w? me through deepe seas tooke their flight My sayntes my cuntrey Gods also that are full great of might. There lieth a land far loof at seas, where Mars is lord, and wheare Thracia.The largy feeldes and fertill soyle mee Thracia cald, doth eare. Sometime Lycurgus fearre therin did reygne and empier hold. An auncient stay to Troy, and like in faith and freendship old While fortune was. To that I went, and on the crooked shore Foundations first of walls I laid with destnies lucke full sore. And of my name their name I shoope, and Aeneads them call. Unto the mother of Gods that time, and heauenly persons all Great sacrifice I made, for lucke my woorkes to prosper new, And to the king of heauen himselfe a bright bull downe I slew. A banke by chaunce by mee there stoode, where bright as horne of hew A tree called a Mirtill.With rods vpright and braunches thicke a Myrtill bushe there grew. I drew mee neare, and from the ground the greene brush vp I pull, Myne altars to adorne therwith with bows and shadowes full. A dreedfull sight and monster (maruell great to tell) I found. For from the twig that first I brake and rootes I rent from ground. The blacke blood out doth breake, &amp; downe with trickling drops it trils Defiling foule the soyle, with that for feare my body chilles. My limmes do quake, my blood for dread doth shrinke with frosty colde. Another braunche againe to plucke with force I waxed bolde, The cause therof to learne, and see what thing therunder lay. Feelde Nimphes otherwise called faieries.That other braunche againe doth bleede, and blacke doth mee beray. Great things in minde I kest, and straight the feeld Nimphes I adore, And Mars the father great that prince is of that lond and shore, Good fortune mee to send, and turne that sight to good they shuld. But whan the thyrd time twigs to take with greater might I puld, And knees against the sand I set with force, what shall I doo? Speake out, or silence keepe? a piteous wailing vs vnto Was heard from out the hill, and voice thus groning spake me to. Why doost thou thus Aeneas mee most wofull miser teare? A voyce to Aeneas made by Polidorus his neuew there slayne. Abstaine thy graue to file, from sin thy gentle hands forbeare. I am to thee no straunger borne, nor thus deserue to speede, This blood thou seest from out this stub ywis doth not proceede. Flee, flee (alas) this cursed shore, flee from this greedy land, For I am Polidore, in this place slayne I was with hand, This bush of dartes is growne, &amp; sharp with pricks on me they st?d. Than more with doubt and dread opprest my minde fro me was past. I stoinid, and my hear vpstert, my mouth for feare was fast, This Polidore sometime, with gold of weight full huge to tell, His father Priam king (good man) by stelth had sent to dwell Unto the king of Thrace, whan first to Troy he gan mistrust, Whan hee the citie sieged saw, that needes defend hee must. A false kinge. But hee whan Troy decay began and fortune fourth was past, The stronger part he tooke, and (Agamemnon ayding fast) All truth hee brake, and Polidore of chops, and than the gold By force into his hands hee caught, and held, What can be told? Or what is it that hunger sweete of gold doth not constraine Men mortall to attempt? whan feare my bones forsooke againe, Unto the peoples lordes I went, and first vnto my sier, The monsters of the Gods I shew, their councels I requier. All they with one assent do bid that cursed lond forsake. To leaue that hostrie vile, and ships to windes at south betake. Anon therfore to Polidore a herse we gan prepare, And huge in heyght his tombe we reare, all altars hanged are with weedes of mourning hewes, and Cipres trees and blacke deuise, They make Polidorus obyt. And Troian wiues about with hear vnfold as is theyr gise. Great fomy boolles of milke wee threw luke warme on him to fall, And holy blood in basons brought wee poure, and last of all Wee shright, and on his soule our last with great cries out wee call, Than whan the seas we see to trust and winde with pipling sweete Is out at sowth, and to the seas to sayle doth call the fleete: My mates their ships set forth, and shores with men they mustred all, To seas wee flee, and as we flee, both townes and hilles do fall. They w?t to y? yle of Ortigia. There is a lond in mid sea set whom Neptune deere doth loue, And mother of the Mermaides eke, that lond sometime did houe In floodes, and to and fro did stray, till Phœbus it did binde With landes about, and fixt it fast, and bad defie the winde, With Giarus and Mieonee (two countreys) strongly stayed. Whan in we came, our weary ships in hauen at rest wee layed. And went to worship Phœbus towne, and giftes with vs we beare. Kinges y? time were preestes.King Anius, king of men and Phœbus preest against vs there, His head with holy labels layd and crowne of laurell greene Came out, and welcome bad his freend Anchises long vnseene. Than hand in hand wee set, and lodging tooke in houses hie. He maketh his praier to Apollo for knowledg whither to goe.I worship eke the temple there that to that God I spie Of auncient stone: O Phœbus bright giue me some house to dwell, Giue walls to weary men and town from whence may none expell. Haue mercy vpon our blood and saue of Troy this last remaine, The leauinges of Achilles wilde and Greekes abiectes vnslaine. Who shall vs leade? or where apoint our place it may thee please? Our rest to take, giue token God, enspier our hartes with ease. Scant this I said, whan trembling fast with sodein shew to shooue The Laurel trees gan quake, and dores, and thresholdes all do mooue. The mount therwith doth bend, and vp the gates with roring brekes, Adown to ground all flat wee fall, and strait a voice there spekes. Ye Troians tough, the ground that you first bare from parents bold: The same shal you receiue againe, seeke out your grandame old. Apollos aunswere doubtful.For there Aeneas house shall stand, whom contreis all shall dreede. And childerns childe and all their ligne that of them shall proceede. This Phœbus said, and wee for ioy great noyse and murmur make, And what those walls should be wee scan, and councel great we take What place it is that Phœbus bids to seeke, and where to finde. My father than the stories old of auncient men to minde Doth call, and than, you lordes (quoth hee) lay now to mee your eare, Anchises enterpretes the prophecie to lead to Candy.And marke mee well, for now of mee your great hope shall you leare. Candy from hence in mid sea lieth, Ioues ylond great it is, Where Ida mount doth stand, and where first sprang our stock ere this. A hundred mighty townes they keepe, most frutefull soile to till: From whence our auncient gransir great (if true report I skill) King Teucrus issued first, and on the coast of Rhoeta hyt. And there his kingdome first began, Troy was not vp as yet, Cibele a goddesse.Nor Ilion toures did stand, but there in low vales did they dwell. Cibele wildernes doth haunt therin with sounding bell. And Coribantes beat their brasse the moone from clips to cure. Corib?tes people y? beat basins wh? y? moone is in the clips. From thence wee haue that seruice time we keepe with silence pure, For Lions in that ladies chare their yokes to draw do beare. Come on therfore, and where the Gods do call, let vs go there. Please wee the windes, and foorth to Candy kingdomes let vs wend, The course is not so long (if Ioue vs lucke vouchsaue to send) Our ships on Candy shore to stand the third day shall we see. So speaking, on his altars there due honours kill did hee, A bull to thee O Neptune first, a bull to Phœbus bright, A blacke beast to the winter storme, to western slaws a white. There flieth a fame that of his fathers kingdoms quite forsake, They heare that Candy is voide of a kinge. Idomeneus duke therof expelde his flight hath take. And all the coast of Candy lieth wide open for their foes, Unfenced, and the townes of people voyd, so rumour goes. Anon therfore our hauens we left, and through the seas we flie, By geeene Donisa, and Naron hills where men to Bacchus crie. Olearon, and Paron white as snow, and skattrid wide Of Cicladas we compas lands, that rough seas makes to ride. Their course to Candi out of Thracia The mariners their shoutes vp set, eche man his mate doth bold, To Candy let vs cheerely fare, to seeke our gransiers old. A mery coole of winde them fast pursueth, and foorth doth driue, And at the length on Candy coast our ships wee do arriue. My town therfore (with great desier) and walls I gin to frame, And Pergam I the citie call, right glad they take that name, He bildeth a towne in Candy. I courage them that lond to loue, and towres and temples byld. And now welneare our ships vp set, drie lond our nauy hyld, With weddings and with tillage new the youth them selues applies, And houses eke and lawes I gaue: whan sodenly doth rise Among them (foule) a plage, and piteous murreyn to be thought, The skies corrupted were, that trees and corne destroied to nought, And limmes of men consuming cottes, such yere of death them deares, That sweete life of they leaue, or long their greeuous wo them weares. The Dog star vp doth rise, the soyle for heat of sonne doth frie, A pestilence. That graine and grasse vp dries, and feelds of foode doth men denie. Agayn to Phœbus holy seat, yet backe againe our way Through seas my father bids vs turne, and Phœbus mercy pray. What end of wo to wery men he puts, and how from paine Our selues we may relieue, and where from thence to turne againe. Than was it night, and on the ground all creatures laid a sleepe, His images gaue him answere.The gods of Phrygi lond, whom I with me full deare did keepe, Whom from the mids of burning Troy with mee I brought in flight Before mine eyes (as dreame I did) I saw to stand vpright, All shining in their glory bright beholde I might them cleere, The way that through my window than the full moone did appeere, They spake also, and thus from mee they lighten gan my cheere. The thing that of Apollo now to know you doo entend, He speakes it here, and vs to thee with glad will doth hee send. Wee from the flames of Troy with thee thine army came to gyde. Wee vnder thee with nauy great the salt seas broad haue tried. Wee be the same that to the stars thy ligne shall lift with pride, And empier great we shall thee geue, and citie great to reare, For mightie men make mighty walles, long flight do thou not feare, Chaunge yet thy place, not here it is that Phœbus bids thee bide, It is not here to Candy shore Apollo thee did guide. There is a place the Greekes by name Hesperia do call, An auncient lond and feirce in war, and frutefull soile withall. Out from Oenotria they came, that first did till the same, They apoint him to Italy.Now Italy men saith is cald, so, of the captaines name. There be our dwelling seates fr? thence king Dardan selfe was borne, And Iaseus the prince from whom our ligne descends beforne. Arise, go to, and tell this thing vnto thy father deare, Seke out Italia land, the shores of Corit coast enqueare, Be bolde, proceede for Ioue doth thee from Candy contreis take. Astoined I with this was made whan gods to mee so spake. For slomber was it not (me thought) but plaine their faces bright, And solded hear be wrapt I saw, and knew them sure by sight: With colde swete all my body than did ronne, and therwithall From out my bed I leapt, and strait on knees there downe I fall. My hands to heauen I held, and praied, and giftes and offringes pure, In fiers to them I threw, and all my duty don with cure: Th? they knew they had expounded the prophecie wrong. Anchises I asserteyne than, and him declare the caas. Anone the doubtfull ligne he knew, how hee begylid was, By graunsyrs twain and children twain, and places olde mistake. Than said he thus, O son whom Troy by destnies tough doth make. Cassandra alone, of all mankinde, these things to mee did tell, These chaunces of our stocke she sang, I now remembre well. Of Italy full oft she spake, oft of Hesperia shore. But who could euer thinke that time, or this beleeue before? That Troians to Hesperia land should come to dwell at last? Of prophecies, or who that time of mad Cassandra past? To Phœbus let vs yeeld, and after warning take the best. So spake he, and anon with ioy all wee obeyed him prest. That seat also wee than forsake, and (few folke left behinde) With beames through hugy seas wee cut, and sailes set vp for winde. Whan to the deepe our ships were come, and now on neither side Appeeres no land, but seas and skies about vs broad are spied: A shoure aboue my head there stood all dusky blacke with blew, A storme. Both night and storme it brought, &amp; rough the waters dark their hewe. Straight all the seas with windes are tost, and mighty surges rise, And through the deepes we to and fro be thrown in wonders wise. The cloudes inclosid haue the day: dim night hath hid the heauen: And from the skies the lightning fiers do flash with grisly steauen. From out our course we be disperst, and blinde in waues we stray, Eke hee him selfe our maister there can skant the night from day Discerne hee sayth, so trobleth him the tempest Palmure, Nor in the waters wilde his way to hold he can be sure. Three daies therfore vncerten where wee go, withouten sun In seas we wander wide, and three nights like in darke we run Withouten star: the fourth day land to rise we spied at last, And mountaines far in sight are seene, and smoke do seeme to cast. Our sailes forthwith do fall, and vp with ores, and than anon The mariners do sweepe the seas, and through the fome they gon. Escaping so the streames on shore at Strophades I light, At Strophades, for so their names in Greekish toong doth hight. They ariue at Strophades For Ilands in the salt sea great they stand, wherin doth dwell Celeno foule mishapen bird, and Harpies more right fell: Since Phines house from them was shut, their former fare they fled. A monster more to feare than them, nor plage was neuer bred. Description of m?strous foules called Harpies. Nor from the pit of hell vp start the wreke of god so wilde. Like foules with maidens face they ben, their paunches wide defilde With garbage great, their hooked pawes they sprede, and euer pale With hungry lookes. Whan there we came, and first in hauen wee entred, lo wee see The heardes of beast full fat to feede on euery side full free, And goates also to grase, and keeper none there was to vew: Our wepons on them fast we lay, and downe them thicke we slew, And bankes vpon the shore we make, and gods to part wee call, And Ioue him selfe to blesse the pray, and fast to meate wee fall. But sodenly from downe the hilles with grisly fall to sight, The Harpies come, &amp; beating winges with great noys out they shright, And at our meate they snatch, and with their clawes they all defile, And fearefull cries also they cast, and sent of sauour vile. Againe into a priuie place where rockes and caues doth hide, With trees and shadowes compast darke our tables wee prouide. And altars vp againe we make, and fiers on them we tinde. Againe from out a diuers coast, from holes and lurkings blinde, The preas with crooked pawes are out, and sounding foule they flie, Polluting with their filthy mouthes our meate, and than I crie: That all men weapons take, and with that vgly nacion fight. They did as I them bad forthwith, and in the grasse from sight Their swords by them they laid, &amp; couching close their sheelds they hide. Than wh? the third time from the cliues with noise again they glide: Misenus from aloft with brasen trompet fets a sound. My mates inuade them than, and felt the fight but newly found, And on the filthy birdes they beat, that wild sea rocks do breede, But fethers none do from them fall, nor wound for stroke doth bleede, Nor force of weapons hurt them can, their backes and wings no speare Can perce, but fast away they flie, full hie from sight, and there The pray to vs halfe maunched, and begnawn full foule they leaue. Celeno a Harpye.But one of them, Celeno, than her selfe on rocks doth heaue Unhappy tale to tell, and thus her lothsome voyce she brake. And is it war (quoth shee) with vs? war Troians do you make? And for our cattell slaine, do you with vs to bataile bend Pore Harpies, and our kingdome take from vs that nought offend? Take this with you therfore, and well my words imprint in minde. That God him selfe to Phœbus said, and I by Phœbus finde, That am the chiefe of furies all, and thus to you I tell: To Italy your course you take, whan winde shall serue you, well: In Italy ariue you shall, and hauen possesse you there, But power you shall not haue your towne nor walles therof to rere Till famine for your trespas here, and for our cattell slaine, Shall pinche you so, that tables vp to eate you shalbe faine. She said, and into woods therwith full fast she tooke her flight. She prophecieth, hunger which afterward is fulfilled in the seuenth booke. But than my mates, their blood for colde did shrinke, and sore affright, Their corage downe doth fal, and now no wepons more they welde, But vowes and praiers make, and downe for peas they kneele in felde. If goddesses perchaunce they bee, or furies, or of seas Some boistous birdes, what euer it is, full fain they would them pleas. But than my father Anchises vp his handes to heauen on hie Doth hold, and to the Gods aboue with honours great doth crie. O Gods defend this feare, O Gods from this chaunce vs preserue, God saue good men from harme, than from that shore he bids to swarue, And cables vp to winde, and sailes vp hoys with halsers hie. The northen winde vs blows, and fast through foming seas we flie, Another course. Where winde doth driue, &amp; where our master calls our course to keepe. Zacinthous ylond, full of woods, appeeres amids the deepe. Dulichium, and Samey londes, and cragges of Nerite hye, Of Ithaca we flee the rockes, and (as we passe them by) The kingdome of Laertes there, syr false Vlisses nurse, That land aloofe we leaue, and it with good cause oft we curse. Anon the point Leucates cald, and cloudy tops of hyll Apeeres Apollos point, and coast that shipmen trust ful yll. All weary there wee land, and there the citie small wee vew, Our ankers out we layd on land, and ships to shore we drew. All this while he had passed the daungerous ylands adioining to Greece. Therfore, to main land whan we came long looked for at last, Processions great to Ioue we make, and altars kindle fast. And on the shore in Troian gise our games and places we point, Some wrastling for disport with naked limmes in oyl anoint, And maistries with th? selfes they try, great ioy they make to see: That through so many townes of Greekes, and foes they skaped bee. This while the sonne with compas wide the great yeare brings about, And winter windes &amp; northen frostes rough seas doth make men dout. A sheeld of beaten bras, sometime that Abas strong did weare: He set vp a monument ther with a tytle. On postes I fixed fast and tytle wrote, and left it there, Aeneas from the victor Greekes, these armes hath offred here, Than portes I bid them leaue, and foorth to sea them selfes to stere. Strait w? their ores they skom y? seas, &amp; salt fome through they sweepe, And strait from sight Pheaea towres we hid with mountaines steepe. And round about Epirus cost we ronne, and than anon Againe to seas. To Chaon hauen, and vp the towne of Butrot hie we gon. A wonders fame there fils our eares, and rumour thought but vaine, That Helenus king Priams son on Greekish townes doth raigne, And wedded vnto Pirrhus wife, and Pirrhus kingdomes keepes, Andromache maried to Helenus.And how Andromache eftsones with Troian husband sleepes. I stoinid, and with woonders loue my hart in fier did glow, To see the man, and of that chaunce the fortune great to know. From out the hauen I went to walke, my fleete bestowed behinde. Great sacrifice by chaunce that time, and giftes with heauy minde, Before the towne in greene wood shade by Simois water side, Andromache to Hectors dust with seruice did prouide, And deintees great of meat she brought, and on his soule she cried, At Hectors tombe, that greene with gras and turfes stoode her beside. And causes more to mourne therby, two altars had she set. Whan toward her she saw me come, and Troian armours met: Al straught with monsters great she stert, &amp; frantike like, affright, Astoynid stark she stoode, her limmes had heat forsaken quight. She fell ther with, and long at last with these wordes out she shright. And is it true? see I thy face? true tidings brings thou mee? O Goddesse son? and art aliue? or (if we chaunged bee Into some other world) where is my Hector now quoth shee? And with that word her eyes on water brast, and therwithall The court with cries she filde: and I whom sorow thus did pall, Few wordes could I reply for woo, and answerd thus again, I liue in deede, and after daungers all in breath remain, Doubt not for trueth thou seest. Alas, how from so great a fall, so great a husband slaine, What chaunce doth thee restore, or fortune due doth entertaine? Andromache, of Hector wife, Pirrs wedlockes dost thou keepe? She kest her eies on ground, and soft with voyce she did be weepe. Polixena was slain by Pirrhus, whom she calleth happy in respect of her selfe.O happy most of happies all, king Priams doughter bright, That vnderneth the walles of Troy was done to death outright Before her enmies tombe, for lots on her were neuer cast, Nor neuer she to maisters bed was captiue fixed fast. But wee, when brent our contrey was, through sundry seas with paine The pride of fears Achilles ympe, and yonglinges hie disdaine In thraldome, to our trauailes great haue borne, but he at last, His minde on Helenes doughter, (gay for Greekes to wed) did cast, And me his maide, to Helenus his man, for wife he left. But shortly him, for ielous rage, and for his spouse bereft, Se sheweth what she had w? Pirrhus, &amp; of his end Orestes full of furies wood, all onaware with knife Him slew, and on his fathers tombe him chopt, and tooke from life. Than died Neptolemus also, and of his kingdomes all This part to Helenus befell, which hee did Chaon call, Of Chaon Troian lord: and Chaon fieldes their name is yet. This Pargame towne hee bilt, and Ilion tour theron he set. But thee what destny thus doth gyde? what winde thee here doth driue? Shee stops in her tale for sorow. What chaunce or god onto this coast vnknowen doth thee arriue? How doth Ascanius thy childe? doth life and breath him feede? Whom timely Troy to thee. How farith hee? how? for his mother lost doth hee not long? Doth he not manfull vertues great embrace? and them among Example of his father take, and vncle Hector strong? These things with teares she tolde, and weeping long for wo she drew, Whan from the towne the prince himselfe descending there we vew, King Helenus, king Priams son, with lordes a stately traine. His countreymen he knew, and vs to towne he brought full faine, And teares from out his eies in talke, at euery word did fall. I went mee forth to walke, and Troy by name that citie small, In countenaunce like to Troy the great, and Pergam wals I vew: And slender brooke of Xanthus name, and gates well like I knew. The Troians in their countrey towne also, their easment take, The kinge him selfe great cheare to them in parlours wide doth make, A feast. And wine in plenty great they quaffe, and deinty meates in golde They feede, and seemely set in hall, their cups in hands they holde. And thus a day or two the time we past, whan winde at wils Begins to blow, and calling foorth our sayles with puffing fils. Onto the sacred king I went, and freendly prayed him thus. O Troian king, that secrets hie of great Gods canst discus, He desireth some knowledg of his fortune. Whom Phœbus token trees, and stars of heauen, hath taught to skrie, Both chirming toongs of birdes, and winges of foul that swift doth flie. Tell sooth I thee beseeke, for lucky course, and happy trade Religions all and all the gods with one voice do perswade. But one alone, (a monster straunge to thinke, and sin to speake) Celeno, harpie foule, doth woonder tell, and fearfull wreake Of hunger vile, what daunger furst shall I escape alas? Or wherunto shall I mee trust through paines so great to passe? There Helenus (as custome was) furst heyfers downe he slew, And praied his God of peace, and than the labels he withdrew From of his holy head, and to thy blessed secretes, mee O Phœbus hand in hand he brought, all trembling them to see, Answere, of HelenusAnd than with mouth diuine he spake, both priest and prophet hee. O goddesse son, (for greater lucke than mankinde, through the deepe Doth gyde thee thus, and greater might to greater things doth keepe Right true it is, the king of gods him selfe so destny gydes, So lots doth fall, and so the wheele of fatall order slydes. Few thinges of nombers mo, to thee, that bolder through the seas Thou maist endure, and to thy port at last arriue with eas He declareth him his courses.In brief I will declare, for destnies deepe I leaue ontold, I know them not, and Iuno more to tell my toonge doth holde. First Italy, whom nere at hand onware thou doost suppose, And nere at hand in hauen thy rest to take thou doost propose, Far out aloof, and long aloof it lieth, in compas sore, And furst in Sicil streame thou must embathing bend thine ore, And fleeting in the salt-sea fome long coursings must thou make, For Circes yle must furst be seene, and lands of Limbo lake, Ere thou thy citie safe on land maist builde, and resting finde. Tokens.These tokens I thee tell, do thou imprint them well in minde. Whan thou alone with carefull hart shalt sit besides a flood, And see a sow of mighty sise that late hath layed her brood, Beneth a bank among the rootes with thirtie sucklings out, All white her selfe on ground, and white her brats her dugs about: There shall thy citie stand, there lieth thy rest of labours all. Nor dread thee not the plage that shall of tables eating fall, The destnies will inuent a way therfore, and Phœbus bright Shalbe thine ayde, and thee therof from dangers all acquite. But yonder coast, and all that lond that ouer next vs lies, He bids him fetch a compasThough part of Italy it bee, attempt it in no wise. Leaue all aloof, the cursed Greekes all cities there haue filde, One quarter men of Loerus hath, and castels strong they bilde. Another were in Salent field, all places pestring wide, Idomeneus duke his army keepes, and there beside Petilia smal, whom Philoctetes wall doth compasse round, Duke Melybee therin doth dwell, and Greekes possesse the ground, Moreouer, whan the seas are past, and ships in safety stand, And altars thou shalt make to pay thy vowes vpon the sand: He teacheth him a new maner of sacrifice. With purple weedes and hoodes of purple hews your selues attyer, In purple hide your heads from sight, before the sacred fier, For honour great of Gods: that no vnfrendly signe or face, Of enmytie apeere, disturbing all, and hinder grace. This custome keepe thy selfe, so let thy mates and all thy traine, In this religion pure also thine ofspring shall remaine. But whan approching Sicil coast the winde thee foorth doth blow, And that Pelorus crooked straites begin them selues to show. He shews him of diuers dangers. Than left hand land, and left hand sea, with compas long alee, Fetch out aloof from londs and seas on right hand, see thou flee. These places two sometime, by force with bretche and ruines great, (So Tyme doth alter thinges, and what is it but Age doth eate?) From soonder fel (men say) whan both in one the ground did grow, The seas brake in by force, and through the mids did ouerthrow Both townes and fieldes: and Italy forthwith from Sicill side Sicil and Italy were sometime but one land. Did cut, and yet with narow streame and sharpe it doth deuide. The rightside Scylla keepes, the left, Carybdis gulf vnmilde, With gaping mouth she sits, and to her wombe the waters wilde Three times to ground she gulps, and thrise the same to skies on hight By course aloft she lifts, against the starres the surges smight. But Scylla couching close in caue, if pray she haply findes, Her head aboue the streame she holdes, and ships in rockes the windes. Carybdis. Scylla. From shoulders vp a man she seemes, in breast a mayden bright, But from the nauell down, a whale, with vgly shape to sight. Compacted of the wombs of wolues, and mixt with Dolphins tailes, Behind her long they lag, and thus in seas her selfe she trailes. Yet better is Pachinus point, and crookes both in and out By leysure all to seeke, and courses long to cast about: Than once this Scylla monster wilde behold in dongeon foule, Or heare the roare among the rocks of dogs that there do houle. Besides all this, if cunning ought of prophecies, or skill To Helenus is giuen, if Phœbus mee doth truely fill: One thing to thee thou Goddesse son, one thing, and ouer all One thing I will thee warne, and yet againe, and yet I shall. Great persons must be won with humility. Dame Iunos Godhode great adore, with hart and praiers meeke. To Iuno make thy vowes that lady great and mightie seeke To win with humble gifts, so shalt thou to thy minde at last, All safe to Italy aryue, the lond of Sicill past. There whan thou comst, and Cumas town thou entrest first at shore, Where holy lakes, and woods, and floods (Auerna cald) doth rore, The descripti? of Sibyll.A frantike Prophet priest of womankinde thou shalt behold, That deepe in ground doth dwell, and vnder rockes her selfe doth hold, And destnies out she sings, and leaues with notes and names she signes What euer thing that virgin writes, in leaues and painted lines, In rimes and verse she sets, and them in caues in raunges couche: There still they lye, nor from their orders mone if nothing touche. But whan the dore by chaunce doth turne, &amp; winde the corner blowes: Their heapes a sonder fall and forth they flie, and breake their rowes, She them to stay, nor from their caues to flie doth neuer let, Nor seekes them eft to ioyne, nor of her verses more doth set. Away they ronne, and Siblyes house their maistresse seate they hate. There let no time be lost, but though for hast thou thinkest late, Though all thy mates do call and cry to seas, and winde at wil Allureth forth thy fleete, and sailes thou maist with puffing fill: Assay the prophet first, and her with praiers due beseache Thy destnies thee to tell, and chaunces all by mouth to teache. Of Italy she shall thee shew, and peoples all declare, And wars at hand, and how thy self therto thou mayst prepare. He byds him resort to Sibyll.And euery labour how thou maist auoide, or how endure, And all thy course she wil thee tell, that preist and prophet, pure. These things I may thee shew, and this to heare hath been thy chaunce, Go, play thy part, and mighty Troy to heauen with deedes aduaunce. Which things, whan thus the prophet me so like a freend had tolde: Great gifts of Yuery wrought, and treasour great in weight of golde, He renewes them with furniture.To ships he bids vs beare, and rowmes abourd he made to lade With siluer plenty great, and Plate full riche and massy made. A gorgeous armor coat also, threefolded gilt with hookes Of golde, and helmet eke, with crest theron that glistring lookes, Neptolemus his armes. My father eke hath his rewardes. And horses more, and captaines more. And armour eke vnto my mates he gaue, and doth supply Our want of Ores, my father all this while doth bid them hie, And sayles in order set, that nothing lacke whan winde doth call. Whom Phœbus prophet spake vnto with these wordes last of all. Anchises, whom dame Venus proude in bed did not disdaine, Thou care of gods that twise from Troyes destruction doost remaine: Lo Italy, lo yonder it to thee, set vp thy sayle And take the same, yet must thou passe by this lond out of faile. That further lond it is, Appollo sheweth that further shore. He sheweth them Italy from Sicile, but they must go about. Go forth, O happy man with such a son, what should I more Prolong the time in talke? and you from winde that riseth keepe? Likewise Andromache no lesse at parting gan to weepe. And robes of riche aray, and broyded deepe with gold she brought, A Troian mantell for Ascanius wondrous gorgeous wrought. And him with giftes, and weauinge workes of gold full gay doth lade. Than said she thus: take this of mee, mine owne hands hath it made, Take this my childe, that long with thee my loue in minde may last. Of Hectors wife receiue thy freends good will, and tokens last, She resembleth him to hir own son y? was kild. O figure, next Astianax, alone to me most deere, So he his eyes, so he his hands, so like he bare his cheere, And now alike in yeres with thee his youth he should haue led. Than parting thus to them I spake, and teares for weeping shed. Now fare ye well, O happy men, whose fortunes end is past. New destnies vs doth call, and we from care to care ben cast. Your rest is ready won, no feeld of seas you haue to eare, To seeke the land that backe doth alway flee you neede not feare, Your citie faire in fashion like to Troy and Xanthus old, Your riuer like, and bildings worthy praise you do behold. Your proper hands them made, the frames therof your selues do reare With better lucke (I trust) and lesse shal neede the Greekes to feare. If euer I to Tyber flood and fieldes of Tyber fayer May come, and see my citie bylt, wherof I not despayer: Two freendly townes hereafter, that and this, both neere of kin, Aeneis before his departure maketh a leage perpetuall betwene their issue Agayn to seas and rested awhile vnder a mo?tayn. Two peoples neighbour like shal dwell, and frendship fast betwin Epirus and Italia lond, whose founder both of name King Dardan is, one blood we bee, and chaunce haue had the same. And now of both one Troy to make in minde let vs prepare, And to our ofspring after vs likewise we leaue the care. In seas we went, and at Cerauniæ neere our selfs we put, From whence Italia lyeth, and shortest course there is to cut. The sonne this while doth fall, and shadows great doth hide the hilles, We spred our selues on lond, and layd vs down with gladsom willes, Whan ships to shore was brought, and chere we make on corners all, Our wery limmes we fresh, and slomber sweete doth on vs fall. Nor yet from vs the midnight houre his compas quite had ron: Lodesman.Whan Palinurus quicke from couche himselfe to stere begonne, To feele the winde, and quarters all with eares attentiue harkes, And euery star that still doth stand or moues in heauen he markes. The waine, the plowstar, &amp; the seuen that stormes &amp; tempests poures, Orion grim with fauchon great of gold also that loures. Whan all thing sure hee seeth, and all thing faier in skies aboue, From shipbourd loud he giues a signe, we than our campe remoue, The way we seeke to keepe, and wings of sailes full hie wee houe. And now the morning read doth rise, and stars expulsed bee, They espy Italy.Whan far aloof with mountaines dim, and low to looke, wee see Italia lond. Italia first of all Achates cried. Italia than with greeting loude my mates for ioy replied. Anchises praier at the sight of Italy. Anchises than my father, straight a mighty boll of gold Did crowne, and fill with wine, and vp to Gods on hye did hold, Auauncing forth in ship. O gods, that londes and seas, and tempests great haue might to gide: Uouchsafe your grace to send, and speede vs fast with winde and tide. They entred a hauen of Italy to sacrifice to their gods on the lande.The winde at wish doth blow: and hauen more open now is neere, And Pallas temple towre to vs doth broad in sight appeere. My felowes made to shore, and downe their sailes they do bestow, The port lyeth in from esterne seas, and crooketh like a bowe. A front it rocks do stand, and salt sea some about them falles, But close it selfe it lieth, on eyther side with hugy walles Two rocky towres arise, the temple shrinkes away from shore. There for a lucke foure horses first I saw to feede in gras, The ground with teeth they share, and white as snow their colour was My father than Anchises: war (O contrey land quoth hee) Thou thretnest war, these beasts betoken war, right wel I see. Lucke &amp; unlucke.But than againe, for in the cart I see they wonted were, To draw like matches meete, and glad their bits and yokes to bere, I hope of peace (hee said) than last our blessed gods we pray, And Pallas great in war, that first vs did receiue that day. And heades with purple hoodes before the fiers in Troian gise Again to sea for they must go about to come to Tiber.Wee hid from fight, as Helenus with great charge did aduise, And vnto Greekish Iuno there, with gifts and honours new We sacrifice: and after all things don with order dew, Our shroudes aloft wee lift, and sailes abroad on hie we heaue. Anon the Greekish townes, and contrey sore suspect we leaue. Than passe wee by Tarentum bay, where Hercules sometime (If mens report be trew) did dwell, and there against doth clime Lacima goddesse seat, and towres of Caulon castles hie. And than to Scyllas wrackfull shore with ships approche we nie. Than from the flood a far, wee do the mountaine Ætna see, Aetna the burning mo?tayne in Sicille. And hugy noise of seas we here, and stones that beaten bee Against the cliues, and flapping voice of waues and water sounds, The surges leapes aloft, and from the sands they stere the grounds. Than sayd my father Anchises, lo, here is Charybdis hold, These stones did Helenus declare, these gastly rocks he told. Scylla and Carybdis two da?gers. O mates, lay to your might, and vs with ores from hence remoue. They did doo his commaund, and Palinurus first aboue, His tacle to the left hand set, and sterne to left hand wried: To left hand all my mates their ships, with windes and ores aplied. As hie as heauen we rise, with mounting waues, and therwithall Whan down we come, vnto the soules of hell wee thinke wee fall. Three rorings loud among the rockes wee heard and surges flash, And thries the falling fome to breake, and stars we saw to wash. This while the winde our weary fleete forsooke, so did the sunne, And onaware, on Cyclops coast from out our curse we runne. A hauen right large there is, whom force of winde can neuer moue, Discription of Aetna. But Ætnas brasting noise, and grisly thondring, rores aboue. Sometime therout a blustring cloude doth breke, and vp to skies All smoking blacke as pitche, with flakes of fiers among it flies, And flames in foldings round, to sweepe the stars, the mouth doth cast, Sometime, the rockes and mountaines deepe entrailes, a sonder brast. It belching, bolketh out: and stones it melts, and vp it throwes In lompes with roaring noise, and low beneth the botome glowes. Enceladus (men say) halfbrent, (some time,) with lightning blast A Gia?t. Is pressyd here with waight, and Ætna houge on him is cast. Whose flaming breath along those furneis chimneis vp doth rise. And whan his weery side he haps to turne, in wonders wise All Sicil doth shake with noise, and smoke doth close the skies. That night in woods with straungy sightes &amp; monsters far from kinde Wonderful noises by night in y? wildernesse. Wee troubled were, nor cause of all that nois or sound we finde. For neither star nor light in skies there was, nor welken cleere, Nor yet for cloudes and tempest dim, the Moone could ought apeere. The morning next doth rise at east, and light abroad was spred, And from the skies the drowping shade of night away was fled: Whan sodenly, from out the woods, with flesh consumed leane, A desperat man came to them.A straungy man to sight apperes, in piteous fourme vncleane. To vs hee came, and downe did kneele, with handes abroade vpthrown. Wee loked, foule araied he was, his beard was ouergrown, His vesture rent with thornes, and like a Greeke in weede he went, And was sometime among the Greekes to Troy in armour sent. He whan that Troian enseignes out, and armes of Troy beheld, Affraied, hee pawsyd first, and still him selfe a while hee helde. Anon in hast, all hedlong downe hee ronnes, and praiers meeke, With teares hee wailing makes. Now by the stars I you beseeke, By all the Gods, and by this breath of heauen that men do fede, Take mee from hence (O Troians) where ye list away mee lede, To londes, or seas, I recke not where, I know my selfe a Greeke, And in their ships I came, the spoile of Troy your towne to seeke. For which, if my offence so great deserueth such a wreke: In floods do you mee drowne, or all my limmes in waters breke. If mankinde me doth kill, it doth mee good my life to loose. So said hee, and his knees before vs still hee keept in woose. What man he was wee bid him straight to tell, what kinred borne, And what him ailes, and why hee lookes so like a man forlorne. My father Anchises gaue to him his hand him self anon, And bad him comfort take, for harme of vs he should haue none. Hee set his feare aside, and thus his tale proceeded on. Achæmenides telleth them his hard adu?ture.I am a man of Ithaca, Vlisses wofull mate. My name is Achæmenides, to Troy I came but late. My father sent mee there, and Adamastus is his name, Of poore estate, I would wee yet continued had the same. For in this place, whan all my fellowes fled this coast vnkinde For hast, in Cyclops dungeon wide, they left mee here behinde. A bloudy shop, where slaughters vile, and deynties foule do stinke: But houge and broad within: but he him selfe is worse to thinke. Cyclops were Giauntes.The stars hee reatcheth: such a plague God from this world defend. No hart can him behold, nor tongue in talke can comprehend. On flesh of men he feedes, and wretches bloud hee gnawes and bones, I saw my selfe, whan of my fellowes bodies twaine at ones, With mighty hands he caught, and groueling on the ground outright Against a stone he brake them both, the dongeon floore in sight Did swim with bloud, I saw the bloud, and filthy slauer drop From out his mouth, whan he with teeth their quaking lims did chop. But paied hee was, nor there Vlisses in that daunger great This mischeif could sustaine to see, nor did him selfe forgeat. For whan hee gorged had him selfe with meates and drinking drownd, Hee bowed his necke to slepe, and there hee lay along the ground. An hideous thing to sight, and belching out the gubs of blood, And lompes of flesh with wine he galpyd fourth, wee all vpstood, And praied our Gods for helpe, and all atones him round about We spred our selues, and did his eye with weapons sharpe put out. How Polyphemus eye was put out. His mighty eye, that on his frowning face full broad he held, In compas like the sonne, or like a Greekish arming sheld. And thus our fellowes liues at last full glad we be to wreke. But flee (alas) O caitiues, flee, and fast from shore do breke Your cables. For of the sort that Polyphemus is in dongen deepe, And closeth beastes, and straungers all doth kil, and milketh sheepe, A hundred more a long this crooked coast, of Cyclops fell Among these mountaines hie do stray, and deepe in dens they dwell. Three times the moone her light hath filde, and thrise her light exilde: Since I my life in woods, and hauntes of beastes and monsters wilde In wildernesse do lead, and Cyclops hie from holes and rockes All quaking I beholde, and of their feete I feare the knockes. For hunger, sloes hath ben my foode, and mast on trees I found, And Hawthornes hard, and rootes of herbes I rent fr? out the ground. All things about I spied, this fleete at last on sea, I see. What euer it were, I did my selfe bequeth therto to flee. And now escaped from this wicked kinde, I am at ease. Destroy mee rather you, and giue to mee what death you please. Skant had he said his tale, whan on the mountaine tops aboue, Him selfe among the beastes we see, with boystrous noyse to moue. That vgly Polyphemus, and to shore him selfe enclinde. They see y? Giaunt A monster foule, mischapen, lothsom great, vneeied, and blinde. A post in hand he bare of mighty Pyne, and therwithall He felt his way, and led his sheepe, there was his comfort all. About his necke a pipe there hong, his griefe therwith to ease. Whan to the floods he came, and set his foote within the seas, From out his greeuous eye, the blood hee washt and poison foule With gnashing teeth for wo, and loude for wo began to houle. And through the streamy waues he stamping goth, and yet aboue His brest is nothing wete, and thus him selfe in sea doth houe. They flieWee all affrayd in hast away do flee, and vp wee take Our gest as worthy was, and soft our cables of we brake. Than sweepe we through the seas, &amp; Ores we pull with might &amp; main. Hee heard vs, and against the sound, hee turning stept againe. But whan with hand on vs to gripe, he could not haue his retche, Nor wading through the deepe of seas, vs backe he could not fetche: A roringe loude aloft he liftes, wherat the seas, and all The waters shooke, and londes therwith affrighted gan to pall Of Italy, and Ætna mount did yell as it would fall. The giaunts gather.But from the woods, all Cyclops kinde, in swarmes on euery hill Arose and to the portes they run, and shores along they fill. Wee saw them stand (but harme they could not do) with louring eyes, The brethren grim of Ætna mount, their heades were vp to skies, An vgly councell, like in sight for number to behold Onto a forest great of okes, or trees of Cipres old, Or like Dianas wood that hie to heauen their tops doth hold. All headlong feare enforceth vs to flee, nor way wee know, But foorth to seas in hast wee flew where winde vs list to blow. But than againe king Helenus commaundments did vs stay, To keepe betweene Charybdis gulfe, and Scylla middle way. Betweene them both we past with danger great, an glad we were, If course wee could not keepe, yet backe againe wee thought to bere. Behold, a northern blast from out Pelorus mouth was sent, Therwith Pantagia stony cragges I past incontinent. The winde hope th?.And Megarus, and all those bayes where Tapsus low doth lye I left them all, and through the seas with winde at will I flye. These places vs repeted than, where left hee had beforne, Pore Achæmenides, Vlisses mate vnlucky borne. Against the race of Sicil lond, there lieth in seas an yle, Plemmyrium of auncient men it hight, but later while Ortigia. Ortigia doth it call: the fame is, how Alphæus brooke By secret waies, all vnder seas to this lond passage tooke, His long course about Sicil.And here it brasteth out, and Arethusas mouth it meetes, And therwithall to Scicil seas it ronnes, and foorth it fleetes. The blessed gods that in that place do dwell wee honour than, And strait Elorus fertill soyle we past, and foorth we ran. Than through the rockes that steepe do stand against Pachinus nookes Our waies we share, with labours great we ouercame the crookes. Than Camerina poole whom destnie neuer graunt to moue, And Gelas towne full great, and Gelas hils apeeres aboue. Than Agragas his gorgeous walles aloof sets out on hie: Where horses ferce somtime did breede, the towres a far we spie. And thee with all thy dates Selinus soone I left behinde. And Lilibeas lurking stones and sholdes I passed blinde. Than hauen at Drepanus I tooke, in that vngladsome shore: He tooke hauen at Drepanus in Sicill &amp; there died his father Whan dangers all of seas and tempests great were past before. Alas my father, there, my onely ioy in care and wo, Anchises I, do lose (alas) he there departes me fro. There mee, O father dere, in labours all thou doost forsake: Alas in vaine from daungers all of seas thou hast ben take. Nor Helenus whan he to mee great fearfull things did tell, These wailings did forspeake to fall, nor yet Celeno fell. This is my labour last, there was my iorney long at end. Goinge fr? Sicill y? storme tooke him as in the first boke appereth. From thence departing now doth god me to your contreys send. So lorde Aeneas, to them all ententife to beholde, The destnies of the Gods did shew, and all his courses tolde, He staied at last, and making here an end, did silence holde. DEO GRATIAS. Per Thomam Phaer, in foresta Kilgerran x. Octobris. Anno. 1555. Opus viginti dierum. THE FOVRTH BOOKE of the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. DIDO enraged with the loue of Aeneas discloseth the grief of her minde to her sister ANNE, &amp; following her aduise: she bent her hart fully vnto meriage. Iuno also, to thintent y? she might the more easely kepe Aeneas from Italy: c?muneth with Venus, that she would graunt her assent, that Aeneas might take Dido to wife, &amp; the better to bring the matter to passe, she promiseth to giue great opportunitie therto. The next day following, Aeneas and Dido ride forth on huntinge, wheras, when all the company were busie about their game: Iuno sodenly sendeth a tempest. The many run, some one way, some an other, but Aeneas and Dido meete togither in one Den, and there with yll lucke, they ioyne amarously togither. In y? meane while, Iupiter wearied with the continuall praters of Iarbas kinge of Getulia, who tooke it greeuously y? a straunger should be preferred in loue before him: sendeth Mercury down to Aeneas, to commaund him to forsake Affrica, and to go seeke Italy. Who then obeyinge the commaundement of Iupiter: willeth his mates priuely to prepare all things y? were necessary for sayling. But whan Dido vnderstoode y? his nauy was in repayring &amp; rigging, suspecting the matter to be as it was in deede: greeuously expostulateth the case with him, and through entreatie, &amp; teares, both by her selfe &amp; her sister: endeuoreth to detaine him from his purposed iorney. But Aeneas, admonished agayne by Mercury: late in the night wayeth anker, and departeth away. Then she, through extreame sorow impatient counterfeyting to do sacrifice: caused a great fier to be made in the hiest place of her Pallace, and sendinge away Barce, Sichæus nurse, that she should not hinder her in her apointed death: there slew her selfe most piteously. By this time pereld sat the Queen so sore with loues desier, Her wound in euery vaine she feedes, she fries in secret fier. The manhood of the man ful oft, full oft his famous lyne She doth reuolue, &amp; fr? her thought his face c?not vntwine, His countnaunce deepe she drawes, and fixed fast she beares in brest His wordes also, nor to her carefull hart can come no rest. The morning sonne with shining beames al londs had ouerspred, And from the skies the drowping shade of night away was fled: Whan thus onto her sister deare she spake with vexid head. Deare sister Anne, what dreames be these y? thus my sleepes affrights? What wondrous gest is this that thus among vs newly lightes? How like a lord? how valiaunt strong of hart and armes he seemes? I see right well no fables ben that men of Gods esteemes. Of kinde of gods he is doubtles, by drede are dastards knowen. Alas what wars hath he gon through, what destnyes him hath throwen? If fixid in my minde I were not fast, and shall not flyt, That to no wight in wedlocke band I would vouchsaue to knit, Synce first in vaine my loue I lost, and death did me deceiue, That comfort none in chamber deedes nor ioyes I can conceiue: Perhaps to this offence alone I might be made to slyde. For Anne, to thee confesse I shall (nor trueth I will not hide) Since of my husband first the death and fatall end I knew, And that my brother with his blood his altars did embrew: This only man hath bent my hart, and sore my minde doth moue, I know the steps of old, I feele the flames of former loue. But rather would I wish the ground to gape for me bylowe, Or god him selfe with thonder dynt to hell my soule to throwe, To hell beneth in darknes deepe, with ghosts and furies blake, O vertue, ere I thee refuse, or shamefastnes forsake. He that him first to me did knit, he toke from me my loue, He keepes it, in his graue it lieth, from thence it shall not moue. Thus speaking in her bosom full the teares of water ronne. Than answerd Anne, O sister mine more deare to me than sonne, O sister whom I more regard than life or light of day, Will you alone for euermore your youth thus mourne away? Will you not seeke for children sweete? nor Venus comfort craue? Do dead men care (trow ye) for this? or soules that sleepe in graue? What though sometime (whan sicknes sores and greeues opprest your mind) Of worthy princes none to wed your hart was than enclinde? Nor husband none of Lyby land, or lords you would elect, Nor king Hiarbas eke before whom Tyrus did reiect, Nor capteyns proud of Affrike land of wide renowne and fame: Whan loue that likes you shewes himselfe, will you resist the same? Nor way you not what case ye stand, whose contrey here you hold? Getula townes a people wyld in warres, and vncontrold, And sturdy Moores on euery quarter closes, and beside, The sandes of Sirtes coast, and wildernesse both long and wide, And desertes drie, where saluage men of Barcey broad do stray. Than of the wars of Tyrus now that rise, what should I say? And of your brothers threatnings? I hope the gods of purpose good, and mighty Iunos grace, Hath made the windes to bring the Troian ships into this place. What citie sister shall you see of this? what empier grow? Whan Troian armes to vs are knit, and men this wedlocke know? With what renown and glory great shall Affrike, thinke you, rise? Do you your gods of pardon first beseeke (I thus aduise) And after seruice don, do him in gestwise entertaine, And causes finde from day to day to make him here remaine, While winter winde endures, and while the skies haue laid their rage, And while the ships reparing ben, and force of seas aswage. With this her burning mind incensyd more began to flame, And hope in doutfull hart she caught, and of she kest her shame. First vnto temples all they gon, and peace on altars all They pray their gods to giue, and slaughters down they make to fall, To Ceres first that lawes did giue, to father Bacchus pure, To Phœbus, and to Iuno chiefe that hath of wedlocks cure. Her selfe with boll in hand, Queene Dido Queene most fresh of hew The maner was than to know fortunes by looking vpon the inwarde parts of their slain sacrifices, &amp; by sothsaiers. A louer like a wounded dere.The wine betweene the hefers hornes (so white as snow) she threw, Or at the stagys great of gods with gifts and vowes she walkes With musing minde, &amp; fortunes new by wondrous meanes she calkes: On beastes entrayles she pries, and liuers hote, and from their throtes The breathing lungs she seekes, and euery signe therin she notes. O calcars dreaming heads: what helps her vows, her pilgrim deedes, What helps her temples sought? whan soking flame her mary feedes This while, and festring deepe in brest her wound the faster breedes. So sely Dido burnes, and through the towne with raging cheere Astray she wanders wide, as doth sometime the striken deere, Whom ranging through the chase, some hunter shooting far by chaunce All onaware hath smit, and in her side hath left his launce. She fast to wildernesse and woods doth draw, and there complaines Alone, but vnderneth her ribs the deadly dart remaines. Sometime about the walles she walkes (Aeneas by her side) And towne already made she shewes, and pompe of Tyrus pride. Begins to speake, and in the mids therof her tale she staies. Sometimes againe, and towards night to bankets him she praies, And Troian toyles againe to tell she him beseekes, and harkes With burning minde, and euery word and countnance al she markes. Than whan they parted were, and light of Moone was downe by west, And on the skies the falling stars do men prouoke to rest: She than alone (as one forsaken) mournes, and in his place She laieth her downe, and thinkes she heares and seeth him face to face. Or on her lap Ascanius for his fathers likenesse sake She holdes, if happely so she might this yrksome loue aslake. The workes of towres are left, no feats of armes the youth applies, Nor hauons are wrought, nor for the wars the mighty bulwarkes rise. All things vnperfit stand, the buildings great, and thretnings hie Of hugy walles, and enginnes for their height that match the skie. Whom whan dame Iuno saw with plage so wood to be dismaide, Iuno doth practise w? Venus to keepe Aeneas stil in Affrike y? he might not come to Italy to bild Rome (The mighty spouse of Ioue) nor for no speeche it could be staide: To Venus first she came, and thus to her began to breake. A goodly praise (in deede) and worthy conquest great to speake Thy boy and thou do get: a gaye renowne you do obtaine, If one poore woman trainid be by heauenly persons twaine. Nor thinke not but I know that thou my walles of Carthage hie Hast in suspect, and dreding still the worst, all things doost trie. But shall we neuer ende? or why do we so fearcely striue? And do not euerlasting peace and freendship fast contriue? Why wedlockes ioyne we not? thou hast thy selfe thine owne desier, Now loue in Didos bones is bred, she fries in raging fier. Two people now therfore in one let vs conioyne, and guide With equall loue: to Troian husband (lo) she shall be tyde, And Carthage all I giue to thee for ioynter fast to binde. To her againe (for well she knew she spake with fained minde That Rome she might reiect, and Carthage kingdome empier make) Than Venus answerd thus. Who is so mad that will forsake This thing? or gladly would in war with thee so long contend? If what thou speakest now will fortune bring to parfit end. But distnies makes mee doubt, and whether hee that raignes aboue One towne of Troy and Tyrus made can be content to loue: Or will alow the peoples twaine to mixe and league to binde. Thou art his wife, thou maist he bold to frame and feele his minde, Begin, I will proceede. Than saide dame Iuno Queene so stout, Let mee alone for that: now how this thing shal come about Giue eare to mee, for now my minde thou shalt perceiue outright. A hunting forth Aeneas goth with Dido wofull wight In woods and forest wide, whan morning next begins to spring, And sonne with glistring beames againe to sight the world doth bring. I from aloft a stormy cloude, and mixt with fleet and hayle A tempest darke as night on them to powre I will not faile. While in the woods they walke, and while the youth enclose the toyle: The raine shall rise, and heauens with thonders all I will turmoyle. Their company from them shall flee, eche one his head shall hide, A caue the Queene shal take, the Troian duke with her shal bide. I will be there, and if thy will accord vnto my minde: For euer I shall make them fast and wedlock stedfast binde. There shall begin the day, that sorowes all shall quite exile. Dame Venus graunted that, and to her selfe she gan to smile, She gaue a nod, and glad she was she could perceiue the gile. The morning rose, and from the sea the sonne was comen about, Whan to the gates assemblith fast of noble youth a rout With nets and engins great, and hunter speares full large of length. The horsmen rush with noise, and dogs are brought a mighty strength. The great estates of Moores before the doores await the Queene. In chamber long she staies, and redy brydlyd best be seene The plafrey standes in gold, attirid riche, and feerce he stampes For pride, and on the fomy bit of golde with teeth he champes. At last she comes, and forth with mighty traine she doth proceede, All braue with mantell bright, encompast fresh in glistring weede, Her quiuer on her shoulder hanges, her heares with knots of gold Are trust: and gold about her brest her purple garments holde. The Troian peeres also went on, Ascanius glad of cheere, Aeneas eke before them all that fairest did apeere Aduauncith foorth him selfe, and with the Queene hee ioyneth hand. Most like vnto Apollo cleere, whan to his contrey land To Delos downe he comes, and winter cold he doth forsake, And feastes among his contrey lords and bankets great doth make, The daunsers do disguise them selues, and altars round about, The husbandmen do hop and cry, with noyse and ioyfull shout. Him selfe aloft on hilles doth walke, his wauering lockes behinde He wags, and they with garlonds gay and twists of gold are twinde, His arrowes on his shoulders clattring hanges: in maner like Aeneas went, so great a myrth to men his face doth strike. Whan to the mountaines out they came and hauntes of beasts on hie: Behold, adown the rockes the deare with bounsing leapes do flie. And ouer laundes they course, and many an heard of hart and hynd, With feet through dust vpthrown they skud, &amp; hilles they leaue behind. But in the vale his prauncing steede Ascanius swift bestrides, And sometime these, and sometime those, with swift course ouerrides. With dastard beastes his minde is not content, but maketh vows Some fomy Bore to finde, or Lion ramping read would rowse. By this time heauen with rombling noise and cloudes is ouercast, And thonders breake the skies, and raine outragious poureth fast, And shoures of haile and sleet so sharpe, that fast on euery side The Carthage lordes and Troian youth eche one them selfs doth hide In woods and houses, here and there they seeke, both man and childe For feare, and down from hilles the floods do fall with waters wilde. A caue the Queene did take, the Troian duke with her did bide. The ground proclamyd myrth, and Iuno selfe did giue the bride. The fier and ayre agreed, and to this cowpling gaue their light In signe of ioye, and ouer head the mountaine fairies shright. The fairy ladies. There first began the griefe, that day was cause of sorowes all, For nothing after that by fame she sets nor what may fall, Nor longer now for loue in stelth Queene Dido her prouides, But wedlocke this she calles, with wedlocks name her faut she hides. Anon through all the cities great of Affrike, Fame is gone, The blasing fame, a mischief such, as swifter is there none. Fame the daughter of earth, &amp; sister to y? Giauntes y? attempted to skale heauen. By mouing more she breedes, and as she ronnes her might doth rise. By lowe for feare she lurketh first, than straight aloft in skies, With pride on ground she goth, and percith cloudes with head on hight. Dame Earth her mother brooded foorth (men say) that childe in spite Against the Gods, whan Giantes first of serpent feeted line Enceladus and Ceus wrought hie heauen to vndermine. Than for disdaine (for on them selues their owne worke Ioue did fling) Their sister crawlyd foorth, both swift of feete and wight of wing. Fame. A monster gastly great, for euery plume her carcas beares, Like number leering eyes she hath, like number harckning eares, Like number toonges &amp; mouthes she wags, a wondrous thing to speake, At midnight foorth she flies, and vnder shade her sound doth squeake, All night she wakes, nor slomber sweet doth take, nor neuer sleepes. By dais, on houses tops she sits, or gates, or townes she keepes, On watching toures she climes, and cities great she makes agast, Both trueth and falshed foorth she tels and lies abroade doth cast. She than the peoples mouthes about with babling broade did fill, And things onwrought and wrought she tolde, &amp; blew both good and yll. How one Aeneas of the blood of Troy was come to land, Whom Dido fresh for wanton loue full soone had caught in hand. And now this winter season long in pleasure passe they must Regarding none estate, but giue them selues to filthy lust. These things in mouths of m? this goddesse vile ful thick did thrust. Than turning, straight her way she tooke vnto Hiarbas king, A woer.Whose minde with tales on fier she set, and sore his wrath did sting. This king was Ammons sonne of Garamanth the Nimphe his dame, A hundred temples huge about his kingdoms wide of fame, A hundred altars hie to Ioue hee kept, with waking fiers Both night and day to God, and holy priestes had their desiers Of beastes and slaughters fat: the soiles with blood were all embrued, And sweete with floures and garlondes fresh, the floores alway renewd. Hee mad in minde, and through these bitter newes incensid wood, Men say, as hee before his altars prayed and humbly stoode: His handes to heauen vp threw, and thus hee cryed with vexid mood. Almighty Ioue, whom duely Moores esteeme for God and king, Antiquitie fed vp? beds as the Turkes do yet.And feastes of broidred beds to thee, and wines of ioy do bring, Beholdst thou this? and mighty father thee with thunder dintes Despise wee thus? and yet from vs thy strokes of lightninges stintes? Nor quake we not, wh? through y? cloudes thy sounding breakes aboue? In vaine thy voyces run? will nothing vs to vertue moue? A woman, lately come to land, that bought of vs the ground, To whom the soyle we gaue to tille, and citie new to found, And lawes also we lent, my wedlocke (lo) she hath forsake, He compares Aeneas to Paris.And now Aeneas lorde of her and all her lond doth make. And now this pranking Paris fine with mates of beardles kinde: To dropping heare and sauours nice, and vices all enclinde, With Greekish wimple pinkid, womanlike: yet must the same Enioy the spoiles of this, and wee thy seruauntes take the shame, For all our offring giftes to thee wee finde no fruite but fame. Thus praying in his feruent moode, and altars holding fast, Almighty Ioue him heard, and to the court his eyes did cast, Where now these louers dwell forgettyng life of better fame, Then Mercury to him he calles, who straight obeyed the same. The commaundment of Ioue to Mercury. Go son, come of, and call the windes, and wynged slip thee downe Unto the Troian duke, that now aloofe in Carthage towne Doth linger time, and of his fatall cities hath no minde. Go speake to him, and thus conuey my words as swift as winde. Not such a man his mother deere did promise hee should proue, Nor him from daungers twise of Greekes for this did she remoue: But one that should Italia lond where dreedfull wars do swel By conquest vndertread, and them to right and peace compel, And Troian blood hee should aduaunce to due renowne and fame, And all the world should vnder lawes subdue and rule the same. If glory none of things so great nor corage him doth moue, Nor for his praise him selfe to take the paines he doth not loue, Yet from Ascanius why doth hee the towres of Rome remoue? What meanes hee? why remaines he thus within his enmies warde? And had not vnto Lauin lond and ofspring there regarde? Bid him to sea, this is the somme, (quoth hee) go tell him this. This spoken, hee his fathers minde obeyed as duety is. And first his slender feete with shoes and winges of gold he ties, Mercury busketh him forward. That him both vp and downe doth beare, where euer coast he flies, Both ouer seas and ouer londes, in post in ayer aboue. He tooke his rod also, wherwith from hell he doth remoue The louring soules, and soules also to dongeons deepe he sendes, And sleepes therwith he giues and takes, and men from death defendes. The windes by force therof he cuts, and through the clouds he swims, And now, approching neere, the top he seeth and mighty lims The descripti? of his iorney from heauen along the mauntain Atlas in Affrike, hiest in earth. Of Atlas mountaine tough, that heauen on boistous shoulders beares, Of Atlas olde, whom beating shoures and stormes &amp; tempestes weares: Whose head encompast all with trees of Pine in garlond wise, With louring cloudes is euer clad, that more and more do rise, His shoulders hid with snow, and from his hoary beard adowne, The streames of waters fall, with yse and frost his face doth frowne. There first on ground with wings of might doth Mercury ariue, Than downe from thence right ouer seas himselfe doth hedlong driue, Most like a byrd that nere the bankes of seas his haunting keepes, Among the fishfull rockes, and low byneth on water sweepes. None otherwise Mercurius between the skies and lands Did sheare the windes, and ouerflew the shores of Lyby sands. Whan first the dowres of Affrike land with wingid feete he twight: Aeneas he might see to stand among them broad in sight Aduauncing vp the towres, and houses hie was altring new, Begyrt with hanger bright, beset with stones as stars to vew, And shining read in roabe of Moorishe purple, mantle wise, Hee stood, and from his shoulders downe it hing Morisco gise. Queene Didos worke it was, her precious gift of loue to hold, Her selfe the web had wrought, and warpyd fine with wreath of gold. Straight vnto him hee steps and sayd. Thou now of Carthage hie Foundations new doost lay, and doting doost thy minde applye To please thy lusty spouse, and citie fayer thou doost prepare, Alas, and of thine owne affaires or kingdoms hast no care. Him selfe the mighty god doth me to thee on message send, The king of heauen and earth, that al this world with becke doth bend. Himselfe hath bid me through the windes so swift these thinges to tell. What gost about? why spendest time in Lyby land to dwell? If glory none of things so great thy corage do not moue, Nor thou for praise to take the paine wilt for thine owne behoue: Yet by Ascanius rising now haue some regard to stand, And hope of heyres of him, to whom by right Italia land And empier great of Rome is dew. So said this heauenly wight, And in the middes his tale he brake, and fled from mortall sight, And out of reatche of eyes as thin as aier he vanisht quight. Aeneas than affrighted stood in silence domme dismaid, His heare vprose for feare, his voyce betweene his iawes it stayd. Faine would he flee, and of that contrey sweete his licence take, Astoinid with so great commaundment giuen, and god that spake. Alas what shall he doo? how dare he now attempt to breake Unto the Queene of this? or where his tale begin to speake? His doubtfull minde about him swift he kest both here and there, And sondry waies he wayed, and searcheth dangers euery where. Thus striuing long, this last deuise him liked best of all. His captiynes. Cloanthus and Serestus strong, and Mnesteus he doth call, And bids them rig their fleete, and close their people draw to shore, And armors all prepare, and left therof might rise vprore: Some causes els they should pretend, him selfe whan time shal serue, Whan Dido least doth know, and lest suspectes his loue to swarue, He will assay to seeke most pleasaunt time with her to treat, And meetest meane to make (for craft is all, who can the feat.) They glad without delay their lords commaundment did fulfill, All things in order set, and close they kept their princes will. Anon the Queene had found the gile. What craft can compas loue? She did forcast no lesse, and first she felt their practise moue, All thinges mistrusting straight, and fame also that monster wood Her fumes encreased more, with newes, the ships in armor stood, And Troians for their flight (she said) all things prepared had. Her hart therwith did faint, and frantike (like a creature mad) She railes with ramping rage, &amp; through the streates &amp; townes about With noise she wanders wide, most like a gide of Bacchus rout, Whan shouting through y? fields w? trompet sound they run by night, In freke of Bacchus feast, and mountaines hie they fill with shright. At last vnto Aeneas thus in talke her wordes she dight. To hide also from mee this mischiefe great, hast thou the hart? Thou traitor false? and from my lond by stelth wouldst thou depart? Nor my vnfained loue, nor thy remorse of promise plight, Nor Dido, like to die with cruell death, can stay thy flight? But in the mids of winter storme away thou wilt in hast? In these outragious seas, and through the force of northen blast? O caytife most vnkinde: what if it were a contrey knowne The lond thou gost to seeke, no straungy realme, but all thine owne? What if that Troy, sometime thy natiue towne, did yet endure? Should Troy through all these boystous seas this time thy ships allure? And fleest thou mee? Now by these weeping teares, and thy right hand (For nothing els I left me miser now wherby to stand) By our espousayll first, and for the loue of wedlocke sought: If euer well deseruid I of thee, if euer ought Of ioy thou hadst of mee, haue mercy now, I am ontwind. Destroy not all my house, O be not so extreme onkind, If prayers may preuaile, let prayers yet relent thy mind. For thee alone the tirantes all and kings of Lyby land Do hate me now, for thee alone my people mee withstand, For thee also my shamefast life I brake, and euermore My fame I lost, that to the stars exalted me before. To whom alas shall I be left (O gest) since die I shall? That surname must remaine (for husband thee I dare not call) Why should I longer liue? should I abide the day to see Mine enmies ouerthrow this towne for hate and spite of thee? Or tyll that king Hiarbas come and mee his captiue make? Yet if I chaunced had some frute of thee before to take, If yet before thy flight there were some yong Aeneas small Resembling mee thy face, to play with mee within this hall: Than slaue I should not count my selfe, nor yet forsaken all. These things she spake, but he remembring Ioues commaundment stil, Did stand with fixid eyes, and couchyd care his hart did fill. Few wordes at last he spake. All that (quoth he) and nothing lesse But rather more, what euer toong may tell I will confesse, Nor neuer (noble Queene) shall I denay thy goodnes kinde, Nor Didos loue on mee bestowd shall neuer out of minde, While on my selfe I thinke, while life and breath these lims do gide. To purpose this I speake, I neuer thought nor hoapte to hide (Do you not faine) this flight, nor did prepare from hence to steale, Nor I for wedlocke euer came, nor thus did minde to deale. For as for mee my life to leade if destnies did not let, As I could best deuise, and all my charge in order set, Mine auncient towne of Troy for me and mine I would againe Restore with labour sweete, and Priams towres should yet remaine, For though they conquerd be, their walles againe I would aduaunce. But now Italia lond to seeke, and there to take our chaunce, To Italy Apollo great, and mighty gods vs calles, There lieth our contrey loue. If you delite in Carthage walles, And you a Moore among the Moores reioyce this towne to see: Why should the Troians from their contrey land restrained bee? What reason is but wee likewise may straungy countreys take? My father Anchises soule to mee (as oft as shadowes blake By night doth hide the ground, as oft as light of stars do rise) He warns me through my dreames, &amp; mee with fearful gost doth grise. My child Ascanius eke, to mee most deare, I put to wrong, Whom from Italia realme, and fatall feeldes I keepe so long. And now the message great of God from hie Ioue downe is sent, I call to witnes doth as swift as winde his warning went. I saw the god my selfe as cleare as day, when on the ground He lighted first, and from the walles these eares did heare the sound. Cease for my loue, with wailing thus to fret both mee and thee, Italia against my will I seeke. These things while he did speake, she him beheld with looking glum, With rolling here and there her eies, and still in silence dum His gesture all she vewd, and musing long against him stoode. At last thus out she brake, and thus she spake with burning moode. No goddesse neuer was thy dame, nor thou of Dardans kinde Thou traitor wretche, but vnder rocks and mountaines rough vnkinde Thou were begot, some brood thou art of beast or monster wilde, Some Tigres thee did nurse, and gaue to thee their milke vnmilde. For what should I regard? or wherto more should I mee keepe? Did hee lament my teares? did ones his eyes on water weepe? Did hee not comfort shew? or turne his face to me for loue? What should I first complaine? now now dame Iuno great aboue, Nor god him selfe on my mischaunce with equall eyes doth looke, No stedfast truth there is: this nakyd miser vp I tooke Whom seas had cast on shore, and of my realme a part I gaue, His fleete I did relieue, and from their death his people saue. Alas, what furies driue me thus to rage? Lo now anon, Apollo laith his lottes, to Phœbus now he must be gon. Now Ioue him selfe hath sent his fearefull mandat through the skies, The post of gods is come: here is a fetche of fine deuise, What els? be not the careles gods with these things coombryd sore? These labours vexe them much: who euer heard this like before? They carke for this? I neither that defend, nor hold thee more. Go, seeke Italia through the windes, hunt kingdoms out at seas. In mids therof I hope thou shalt (if good gods may displeas) Upon the rocks be thrown, that vengeaunce due thy carcas teare. On Dido shalt thou crie, with brondes of fier I will be there. And whan the cold of death is come, and body voyde remaines: Ech where my haunting sprite shall thee pursue to giue thee paines. Yea thiefe it shalbe thus: and as I sit in Lymbo low, These tydings when I heare, I shall reioyce thy wo to know. And in the mids of this her tale she brake, and from the light She fleed with heuy hart, and drew her selfe a way from sight, Him leauing there perplexed sore in minde, and sore in feare. Hee would haue spoke, her ladies lift her vp, and vp did beare, To chamber her they brought, in precious bed they laid her there. But good Aeneas though full faine he would her griefe aswage, And wordes of comfort speke to turne from her that heuy rage, In hart he mourned much, and shaken sore with feruent loue, Yet to his ships he went to do the charge of gods aboue. Than all the Troians them bestird, in hast on euery side, Their ships they launched out, the anointed plankes on water glide. And Ores they made of bows, the woods with them to seas they beare Unshapen yet for hast. The disciription of pismires or emotes.From all the towne they ran, you might them swarming thicke behold. And like as Antes apply their worke, that thinke on winter cold, Whan heapes of corne they spoyl, and to their house conuey their store: Their army blacke goeth out, and from the feeldes with labour sore Their booties home they bring, and some the kernels great of graine With might of shoulders shoue, and some behind suruey the train, Correcting some for slewth, with cheering forth the worke it heates, The waies are worne with weight, and euery path of labour sweates. What minde alas O Dido now? what griefe was this to thee? What wailing vp thou setst? whan so on shore thou didst them see? And whan thou mightst be hold before thy face from toures on hie The seas on euery side resound with such vprore and crie? O Loue vnmilde, what doost thou not man mortall driue to seeke? Againe to teares she goeth, againe she falles to praiers meeke, She yeeldes to him for loue, nor nothing will she leaue vntried, But practise all to proue, if ought will helpe before she died. Lo sister Anne, thou seest how swift to shore this people hies, From euery coast they come, their sailes are set for winde to rise, With crownes for ioy their seamen deck their pups in garlandguise. If euer, sister, such a griefe had come within my thought, I would haue borne the same, or els some other shift haue wrought. Yet one thing sister, in this wofull plight do thou for mee, For this periured wretche regarded none so much as thee. To thee alone he would commit both secret thought and deede, Thou knowest y? mans good houres, &amp; pleasant time with him to speed. Go sister, and go tell my wordes to my disdainfull foe: I was not she that did conspier with Greekes to Troy to goe, Nor did subuert his townes, nor ships nor armour euer sent To stroy the Troian blood, nor to his foes assistens lent. I neuer brake his fathers tombe, nor bones in peaces chopt. Why hath he thus to my request his eares so stifly stopt? Where now away to ronne, will he remoue in all this hast? O let him yet haue one respect to me for token last, This one reward I craue, for duties all most miser wight, O let him bide a while, till winde and seas may serue his flight. I seeke no more the wedlocke olde, which he hath now betrayed, Nor from Italia goodly land hee lenger should be staied. I seeke no longer him to keepe his kingdome to forbeare. A vacant time I aske, and respit small my wo to weare, While fortune learne me to lament, and brooke my fatal fall, For pity (sister) sue for me this pardon last of all, Which whan thou doost obteyne: requite it with my death I shall. Thus talked she with teares, and weeping thus both to and fro Her sister went and came, and bare and brought encrease of wo. But weeping nought preuails, nor wailing ought his mind doth moue His brest so stifly bent, entreatinges all from him doth shoue, God worketh so, his gentle eares are stopt from heauens aboue. And as an auncient Oke of timber stout is tost and torne With northen boystous blastes, now here, now there w? bending borne, Whan struggling windes do striue, the craking noise aloft doth sounde, The braunches breake aboue, and bows abrode are spread on ground. Yet still on rockes it standes, and as the top doth climbe to grow To heauens in height: so reacheth downe the roote to Limbo low Non otherwise afflicted is this prince with message brought, Incessauntly with teares, and greeuous cares opprest his thought, Yet standes he fixed still, and teares of eyes do trill for nought. Than Dido (wofull soule) with plagues of destnies soule affright Desires to die, she lothith now of heauen to see the light. Her purpose also further foorth to set, and life to leaue, As she on burning altars did encense and offerings heaue, (A lothsome thinge to speake) the sacred liquors blacke they stood, And wines in powring foorth she saw them turne to filthy blood. This vision to no wight, no, not her sister deere she tolde. Princes had temples in their houses, wher they worshipt them that they loued as god. There was also within her court, to serue her husband olde A marble temple pure of wondrous worke, that day by day Deuoutly she did dresse with fleeses white, and garlandes gay. From thence were voices heard, and speeches plaine did seeme to sound Her husband her to call, whan darcke of night did hide the ground. And oftentimes on houses tops the shriking Oule alone Her deadly song did draw, with wailing voyce and weeping mone. Much things also that prophets old of long time spake before Amazed made her minde with grisly threatnings more and more. Dreames contrary.And visions in her sleepe she seeth. Him selfe Aeneas there Pursues her fierce in chase, and she away doth fle for feare. And euer left alone she seemes to bee, and long alone, She walkes in desert waies, and people seekes and findeth none. Her Moores also she thinkes hath her forsaken fled and gon. As Pentheus whom fables faine with feends enchanted was, Two sonnes at ones, and townes of Thebas twaine did seeme to pas: Or as Orestes bayted was with bugs and ghosts vnkinde, Whan hee his mother fled, and she pursued him fast behinde All girt with serpents grim, and shaking brondes of vengeance fell With fier, and euery doore beset with wrekefull hagges of hell. Desperation.Whan she therfore conceyued had these monsters wood, for wo She gaue her selfe to death, and from this world decreed to go. A time therto she seekes, and what deuise is best to take She studies fast, and to her heauy sister thus she spake. She dissimuleth to her sister y? she hath gotten an old woman to heale her of loue by magike.Lo sister, now reioyce with mee, for I haue found a way, That either I shal hold him still, or els my loue shall stay. There is a lond in Ocean sea, that furthest lieth of all, Where Æthiops do dwell, and where the sonne from vs doth fall, Where Atlas mighty mount on shoulders strong the Heau? doth turne, And vnderprops the pole that stars doth beare that euer burne. From thence a virgin priest is come, from out Massila land, Sometime the temple there she kept, and from her heauenly hand The dragon meate did take. She kept also the fruite deuine, With herbes and liquors sweete, that still to sleepe did men enclyne The mindes of men (she sayth) from loue with charmes she can vnbind, In whom she list, but others can she cast to cares vnkinde. The running streames to stand, &amp; from their course the stars to wreath, And soules she coniure can, thou shalt see sister vnderneath The ground with roaring gape, and trees, &amp; mountayns turne vpright. I call to witnesse God, and vnto thee my trouth I plight O sister sweete, and by thy head whom I so deare do loue, Compeld against my will I must these artes of Magike proue. Under this colour she causeth her funeral fier to be made, for than they vsed to burne their ded. Go thou therfore, and in mine inner court (in secret wise) Prepare the pile of wood, and frame it large aloft in skies. Than take his harneis all, and euery thing that thou canst finde, Which in my chamber yet this wicked theefe hath left behinde. Than all his wearing weedes, and than my bed of wedlocke wo Where I was cast away (alas) lay that with them also. All monumentes and tokens where that sinfull wretche hath past I will consume with fier, so doth my priest commaund in hast. This speaking sodenly she stopt, and stood with loking pale. Yet could not Anne suspect by that, nor by her sisters tale, That vnder such pretence of seruice new, her death she ment, Nor of so fierce outrage she thought, or minde on madnes bent. No greater thing she feared now, than whan Sichæus died. Therfore as she was bid, she did. The Queene, when she prepared had the pile in skies on hie, With logs in peeces cut, and pitche and gummes and timber drie, With garlonds them she decks, &amp; bowes &amp; herbes doth on them strowe, In mourning guise, than all the robes theron she doth bestowe, His sword also she layed, and faier on bed his picture new, She couched all her selfe, and well she wist what should ensue. Her altars stands about, the priest her selfe with heare vnfold, Three hundred gods with thondring mouth she calls, and Chaos old, Coniurations of magike. And gods of vnder ground, and on the threfoldshapen dame, And on Diana virgins faces three she doth exclame. Than waters sprinckling (black as Lymbo pit) on them she throws. And forth by night they gon, where weedes &amp; herbes of mischief grows, With hookes ful hard of bras, by light of moone they seeke and crop Their heary buds, and milke of poison blacke that from them drop Thinges pertein?g to witchcrafte. They seeke also, and from a tender colt they take the knap That from the front at foaling first the dam for loue doth snap, Whom now they do preuent. Her selfe at offring alters pure deuout with giftes in hand, With one foote naked bare, in garment lose vngirt did stand, Protesting loude before her death her gods, and stars aboue, That know her destnies all. Than if there be for them that loue Remembrance ought in heauen, or god that iustice keepes in skies, Regarding breach of faith: to that she prayes and humbly cries. Discription of midnyghtThan was it night, and creatures all that weery were on ground, Did take their slomber sweete, both woods and seas had left their sound, And waues of waters wylde, whan stars at midnight soft do slyde, Whan whust is euery field, and beastes and birdes of painted pride In bushes broade that breede, and countrey foules of land and lake, By night in silence still are set on sleepe, their ease to take, Forgetting labours long, and care away from hart they shake. But not so Dido could, nor neuer rest relieues her minde, On sleepe she neuer fals, her eyes or hart no night can finde. Her cares encreasing rise, with raging loue in brest she boyles A fresh, an surges wylde of wrath within her selfe she toyles. Betweene them thus she striues, &amp; thus her heauy hart turmoyles. Lo, what shall I now doo? shall I againe go seeke with shame, My former suters loue? shall I go sue to wed the same? Whom I so oftentimes to take to mee disdayned haue? Or shall I in the Troian fleete go serue, and lyue a slaue? What els? for where they had before this time reliefe of mee, They wil remember that, and well they quite me now you see. Admit I would so doo, what is he there will me receiue To their disdaynefull ships? O foole, thou doost thy selfe deceiue. O creature lost, doost thou not yet the falshed vnderstande Of that periured nation false of Laomedons bande? What than? shall I alone pursue these boatmen braue in flight? Or shall I rayse my people all in armes with mee to fight? And them that out of Sydon land I skarsely brought with paine, Shall I go bid them sayle, and send them out to seas againe? Nay rather dye thy selfe, as worthy well thou doost deserue, And with this weapon quenche away thine owne distresse and sterue. Thou sister ouercome with teares, on mee this mischiefe furst Didst put, and to my mortal foe didst throw mee most accurst. Could I not yet my life haue led without reproche or misse, As doth some saluage beast? and not haue felt the cares of this? My promise broken is, that I my husband dead did make. These waylings she within her brest with hart full heauy brake. Aeneas than abourd in ship assured foorth to passe Was taking rest, and for the flight all thing prepared was. To him the god agayne in habit lyke, and former face Appearing shewed him selfe, and thus in dreame bespake his grace. All things like Mercury he bare, both forme and voyce and hew, And glosse of shining heare, and comely youth of beauty new. Thou goddesse sonne, in all this parlous season canst thou sleepe? Nor how thou art beset with dangers great hast thou no keepe? Thou foolish man? these goodly westerne windes doost thou not here? She now on mischiefe thinkes, and wicked craft her minde doth stere Assured bent to death, and waues of wrath her hart doth cast. Wilt thou not hedlong flee betime, while power to flee thou hast? Anone the seas enclosed vnder ships, and blasing brondes On euery side shall shine, thou shalt see burning all the strondes, If thee this morning sonne about this countrey finde to raunge. Breake of dispatche: a diuers minded thing, and full of chaunge Is woman kinde alway, dispatche. So spake this heauenly wight, And through the darke of night himselfe withdrew from mortall sight. Aeneas with that sodaine voice in minde right sore appalde: Him selfe from sleepe he shooke, and on his mates he freshly calde. Now euery man awake, bestow your selues on hatches hye, In hast hoyst vp your sailes, againe the god is come from skye, In hast foorthwith to shift, and cables cut from hence to flee, Lo ones againe he calles. O blessed god we waite on thee What euer thou art: thy will againe with glad cheere we obey. Be with vs now for speede, and send vs stars to guide our way, And weather good (he sayd.) With that, he drew his fauchon out, That bright as lightning shone, and cables strake with courage stout. Than euery man bestirs: they seeke, they snatche, they take, they teare, The shores aloofe they leaue, the seas for ships appeeres no where. And now the morning read had left syr Tythons paynted bed, The morning was taken for a goddesse &amp; imagyned nightly to lie w? Tithon king of the East. And broade on earth her glistring beames and light had newly spred. The Queene as dawning waxed white from tooting towres on hie, When she the fleete thus vnder sayle in order did espie, And winde at will to driue, and nothing left behinde at shore, And saw the hauous all emptie stond withouten boate or Ore: Three times her hands she beate, &amp; foure times strake her comly brest, Her golden heare she tare, and frantikelike with moode opprest: She cryed, O Iupiter, O god (quoth she) and shalla go In deede? and shalla flowte me thus within my kingdomes, so? Shall not mine armies out? and all my peoples them pursue? Shal they not spoile their ships, or burne them al with vengeance due? Out people, out vpon them, folow fast with fiers and flames, Set sailes aloft, make out with ores, in ships, in boates, in frames. What speake I? or where am I? what furies me do thus enchaunt? O Dido wofull wretch, now destnies fell thy head doth haunt. This first thou shouldst haue don, whan thou thy kingdom putst fr? thee. Lo this it is to trust. This goodly faith and trouth hath hee That so deuout, his countrey gods men say doth seeke to reare, And he that on his shoulders did his aged father beare. Could I not him by force haue caught, and peece from peece haue torne? Or spred his limmes in seas, and all his people slaine beforne? Could I not of Ascanius chopping made? and dresse for meate His flesh? and than his father done therof his fill to eate? Than grown a doubt there had perhaps in fight, what if it had? Whom dred I bent to death? than would I straight with furies mad Haue brent his campe with bronds, &amp; fild his ships with fier &amp; flame. Both sier and son destroyd, and of their nation quench the name, That done, I would haue thrown my selfe full glad vpon the same. O Sunne with blasing beames, that euery deede on earth doost vewe, And Iuno goddesse great, that knowest what thing to this is dewe: Diana deepe, whose name by night all townes in crospathes crie, And fends of vengeans fell, and gods that Dido make to die, Receiue my words, and turne from me the wreke of sinners paine. Heare now my voyce: yf destnies do that wicked head constraine To enter hauen, and needes hee must with mischiefe swim to land, If god will needes dispose it so to bee, there let it stand. Yet let him vexed bee, with armes and wars of peoples wilde, And hunted out from place to place, an outlaw still exylde, Let him go beg for helpe, and from his childe disseuered bee, And death and slaughters vile of all his kinred let him see. And whan to lawes of wicked peace he doth him selfe behight, Yet let him neuer raigne, nor in this life to haue delight: But die before his day, and rot on ground withouten graue. This is my prayer last, this with my blood of you I craue. Than to their linage all, O you my people shew despite, Other came Hannibal [illeg.]ter plaged Rome.O Moores applie them still with strife, let hatred hate acquite, This charge to you I leaue, these offring presents send you mee Whan dead I am, let neuer loue nor league betweene you bee. Than of my bones arise there may some impe reuenger fell, That shall the Troian clownes with force of fier and sword expell, Now, than, and euermore, as time shall serue to geue them might Let shore to shore, and streame to streame, be still repugnant right. This I desier, let them in armes and all their ofspringe fight. Thus sayd she, and her minde about in compas wyde she kest, Desiring soone this hatefull world to leaue and be at rest. Than thus to Barcey straight, Sichæus nurse she shortly said, (For at her contrey old, her own, in dust before was laid:) Deare nurse (quoth she) go bid my sister hast that she were here, Attyre her selfe she must, and washe with streames of water clere, And offryngs bid her bring, and beastes appointed here to leade. And thou thy head (O nurse deuout) with vesture see thou spreade, Than let her come. To Pluto deepe such vowes as I haue take My minde is to performe, and of my cares an end to make. The tokens all of Troy to burning fier I will commit. She hearing stepped furth, and hasted on with aged wit. But Dido quaking fearce with frantike moode and grisly hewe, With trimbling spotted cheekes, her huge attemptings to pursue, Besides her selfe for rage, and towards death with visage wan, Her eyes about she rold, as red as blood they looked than. Anon to the inner court in hast she ronnes, and vp the pyle She mountyng climes aloft, and on the top therof awhyle She stoode, and naked from the sheath she drawes the fatall blade A gift of Troy, that vnto these effectes was neuer made. There, whan she saw the Troian weeds and couch acquainted layd With triclyng teares awhile, and mourning hart her self she stayed. Than flat on bed she fell, and these her last wordes than she sayd. O sweet remain of clothing left, and thou O dulcet bedde, (While god and fortune would, and while my life with you I ledde) Receyue from me this soule, and from these cares my hart vntwyne. A time of life I had, of fortunes race I ran the lyne: And now from me my figure great goth vnder ground to dwell. My walls I reysed haue, and citie riche that doth excell. My husbands death, and on my brother false I wroke my teene. O happie (welaway) and ouer happy had I beene, If neuer Troian ship (alas) my contrey shore had seene. This sayd, she wried her head, and vnreuenged must wee die? But let vs boldly die (quoth she) thus, thus to death I plie. Thus vnder ground I glady go, lo thus I do expier, Let yonder Troian tyrant now with eyes deuor this fier, As on the seas he sittes, and with my death fulfill his yre. Thus speaking, in the mids therof she left, and therwithall With brest on persing sword, her ladies saw where she did fall. The blade in fomy blood, and hands abrode with sprauling throwne. To heauen the shoutes arise, and through the towne the fame is blown. Lamenting loude begins, and wailings wide, and roarings hie, In euery house they houle, and women cast a rufull crie. The citie shakes, the noyse rebounding breakes the mighty skie. Non otherwise, than if some rage of enemies all their towne At ones had ouerrone, and houses hie were tearing downe, As all at ones should fall, Carthago proude, or auncient Tyre, And buildings both of gods and men should burne with blasing fier. Her sister heard the sound, as dead for dreede she stood vndrest, With nailes her face she tare, and with her fistes she beat her brest, And ramping through the mids of men she ronnes, and by her name She calles her, now in death. O sister mine, and lady dame, Is this the cause that I from thee so far beguiled was? Did I this pyle of fier and altars builde for this? alas, What should I now forsaken first complaine? O sister sweete, Hast thou despised, me to take with thee, a mate so meete? Why didst thou me thy sister to this death disdaine to call? One wepon should vs both dispatch at ones from sorows all. And with my handes haue I so wrought? haue I my gods so cried? That from this cruel plight of thine my presens was denied? O sister, now thou hast vndon this day both thee and mee, Thy towne, thy peoples all, thy worthy lords confounded bee. Carthago quenched is: O let mee wash these wounds in hast, And if there be remaining yet some life or breathing last, My mouth shall fetche the same forthwith. So said she, and now aloft The pyle she clymed had, and in her bosom clasping soft Her sister heauy helde (in pang that was) and with her weede She wailing wiped of the deadly blood that blacke did bleede. She towardes her, her heauie fainting eies would faine haue cast, But fixed vnderneth her brest her wound reboyleth fast. Three times her selfe she lift, and on her elbow sought to stay, And thrise she sounding fell, and there vpon she gaue a bray. Than thrise on bed she tost, and with her eyes vprolling round, Of heauen she sought the light, and groned sore whan it she found. Almighty Iuno than, these labours hard, and passage long Lamented sore to see, and downe she sent in message strong Dame Iris hie, that on the Rainbow read in heauen doth sit, This struggling soule to take, and from these paines her lims vnknit. For wheras no deserued death, nor destnies her did kill, But sely soule before her day, by rage of frantike will, Her golden heare as yet from her not taken was, nor yet Diana dampned had her head to lake of Lymbo pit: Dame Rainbow down therfore with safron wings of dropping shoures, Whose face a thousand sundry hewes against the sunne deuoures, From heauen descending came, and (on her head.) Here I doo thee Lo Pluto now bequeath, and from this corps I make thee free, She sayd, and with her hand she clipt her heare so cleare that shynde, And therwithall her limmes at ones their heate from them resynde. And thin as ayer her life went out, disperst abrode in wynde. DEO GRATIAS. Per Thomam Phaer, in foresta Kilgerran ix. Aprilis, Anno. 1556. Opus Quindecim dierum. THE FIFTH BOOKE of the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. Aeneas leauing Carthage, and sayling towards Italy, by force of a tempest is driuen into Sicil, where, being freendly receaued by Acestes: he celebrateth his father Anchises tweluemonethes minde, wh? he had buried at Drepanus y? day tweluemoneth before. And maketh playes, and games at his graue, and distributeth rewards to such as win them. Cloanthus getteth the price in fight on sea. Eurialus, through the sleight of Nisus: winneth the best in running, &amp; so doth Eurytion in showting. Entellus the auncient, ouercometh Dares at the game called Cæstus (which is fightinge with bags or flaps of leather hanginge by strings, wherin is either lead, or sande) who youthfully boasted of himselfe. Howbeit the cheif rewards, &amp; honour, in respect of age, and dignitie: were adiudged vnto Acestes, whose arrow when it flewe into the ayer: sodenly waxed a fier. Ascanius in the honour of Anchises his grandfather with the other youth of nobilitie practizeth fight, &amp; feates on horsebacke, resembling warlike prowesse. In the meane time the Troiane wiues, at the instigation of the Raynbow and for wearysomnesse of their long trauaile: cast fier among the fleet, &amp; quite destroyed foure tall ships. The rest by a soden showre of rayne sent by Iupiter: were preserued from burning. The night following, Anchises appeareth to his sonne Aeneas in a dreame, &amp; warneth him fr? Iupiter, that following the counsell of Nautes, he leaue behind him the women, and the impotent old men, in Sicil, and himselfe with the force of his army, and the lustiest youthes of all the company: sayle into Italy. Where he should first go seeke Sybillas den, by whose direction hee should be brought vnto him into the fieldes called Elysij, or fieldes of pleasure, where he should bee enfourmed of all the race of his posteritie, &amp; learne the euentes of all wars that should shortly befal him. Wherfore Aeneas then obeying his fathers commaundement: buildeth a citie in Sicill named Acestes, &amp; there maketh a Colonye of women, &amp; old men that were vnfit for war, and him selfe with the strength of his army taketh his viage towards Italy. Therwhiles, Neptunus at the entreaty of Venus maketh the sea calme, whilst Aeneas sayleth. In this goodly calmnesse Palinurus the stearesman fallinge a sleape: is cast helme and all into the sea, whose turne Aeneas supplyeth. Aeneas on his way this while with ships the seas did sheare, Amids the working waues of Northen winde full rough that were, Assured now to passe, and backe full oft he kest his eien To Didos wofull wals, on euery side that now did shine With flames of burning bright, what kindled hath so great a fier, The cause vnknowen it is, but wondrous feates in feruent yre, Is wrought by woman kinde, whan breach of loue hath made th? mad: Thus pensiue passe the Troians from that sight and token sad. Whan to the deepe their ships were come, and now on neither side Appeares no land, but seas and skies about them broad are spide: A showre aboue his head there stoode, all dusky blacke with blew, Both night &amp; storme it brought, &amp; straight the waters darke their hew. Him selfe the Lodesman Palynure from pup at sterne on hie Alack, why hath these clouds so thicke encompast thus the skie? What workst thou father Neptune now? he sayd, and therwithall He bids them trusse their tackels, and with ores to labour fall, And sailes to leeward set, than thwart the winde he kest about, And thus he spake Aeneas prince of might and corage stout. If god him selfe, as now this wether stands, would say to mee, To fetch Italia land, yet would I thinke it could not bee. So worke these wayward windes, and from by west the tempest grim Doth rise with boistous noise, and aier with cloudes encloseth dim. Nor striue no more we may, nor if we list we can come there, Since fortune therfore doth preuaile, let vs with fortune beare, And turne where fortune calls, not far it is (as I suppose) Unto thy brother Erix coast and hauons of Sicil woose, (If I in minde my wonted course of stars do well retaine.) Aeneas gentill said, in deede I see thee striue in vaine With labour all this while, and so me thinke these windes require. Turne thou therto thy sailes, is any lond to me more deere? Or where should I my wery ships more wish to set at rest, Than where Acestes Troian dwells my freend beloued best? He l?deth in Sicil fr? whence he came out at y? first. The king of Sicil. And where my father Anchises bones entombed lyen in chest? He said, and towards hauons anon they make, and windes at west Doth blow them through the deepes, y? chanell swift their nauy driues, And glad at last on their acquainted shore their ships ariues. And from the mountain top, with meruell great to see them fleete, Acestes hasting ran, his contrey ships at those to meete. All hunterlike, in hide of boystous beare, with dart in hand, His father (flood Crinisus) him begat in Troian land. Dame Troy his mother was, his worthy stocke ful stout he bare. He bad them welcome backe, and ioyfully with mountayne fare He did them entertaine, and freendly comfort after care. The morning next, whan first the dawning stars expulsed were, And cleare the day began, Aeneas out from euery where Assembled all his mates, and into counsell did them call. Than from a banke on hie, he thus pronounced to them all. You mighty Troians, from the blood of great gods that descend, This time is comen about, a perfit yere is now at end, Since whan my father Anchises blessed bones were put in ground, And mourning altars for his holy relikes we did found. And now the day (if I do not mistake) approcheth neere, That vnto mee shall euer dolefull bee, and euer deere, Since gods hath pleased so: if I this day were cast a land, Among the saluage Moores, or on the shores of Sirtes sand, Or caught on Greekish seas, or in Micena towne a slaue: Yet pay my yerely vowes I would with pompe of dueties braue, And gifts in feastfull gyse on altars large I would aduaunce. Now here in hauen we bee, among our freends, not by no chaunce, But by the gods (I trust) of purpose wrought, and for the nones, To worship here my fathers blessed dust, and precious bones. Come on therfore, let euery man set foorth these honors pure With mirth on euery side, that of good windes we may be sure. And as I yerely now these offring daies to him do make, So whan my citie builded is, in temples he shall take. They feasted alway before their Idols.For euery ship Acestes giues to you of oxen twaine, With charge your selues to chere, set out your contrey gods againe, And with our host Acestes gods to feasting see you fall: In worship of this day, let vs reioyce with corage all. Moreover, whan the morning ninth to mortall men doth spring, And sunne with glistring beames the world againe to sight doth bring, For prises proud to striue, I will prouoke the Troian fleete. And who so wrastleth best, or best can ronne with force of feete, Or surer driues a Dart, or archer best his bowe can drawe, Or fighting dares combat, with boystous bags of lether raw: Rewards I shall set foorth, and prises meete for euery matche. Be present all, and he that best deserues, the best shall catche. Say all Amen, and crowne your heads with bowes of Laurell greene. So speaking on his head he set his garlond fresh beseene, So Helimus, so kinge Acestes doth, (full graue of age) So child Ascanius doth, and after him both man and page. He from the counsell came with thousands thicke in mighty throng, Unto his fathers tombe, in mids of all his princes strong. Two bolles of blessed wine in solempne guise he kest on ground, And milke in basons twaine about the tombe he powred round, And twaine of sacred blood: than al the graue he spred and layd With flowres of purple hewes, and thus at last full loud he prayd. All haile O blessed father mine, yet ones againe all hayle: From death preserued twise, but nought to me can that preuayle, Thy bones I worship here, vnto thy soule mote glory bee. My lucke was not Italia fatall feeldes to finde with thee, Nor Tyber flood (where euer it is) could we togethers know. Thus talked he, whan from the tombe at secret caue by lowe, A serpent great did slyde, with circles seuen of mighty sise, Along the graue he drew with foldings seuen in compaswise, Embrasing soft the tombe, and tombling soft on the altars rolde, His backe as azure blew, bespotted gay with specks of golde, And glosse of burning skales, as in the clouds with diuers hewes Against the sunne, the rainbow red in thousand sortes renewes. Aeneas with that sight astoynid was, but he along, Came lagging forth in linkes, and all the deynty meates among He tasted euery dishe, and home againe in hermeles wise, Returning tooke his tombe, and was not seene againe to rise. So much the more his fathers tombe he plied with offrings than. For what it was, or how therof to thinke he could not skan. If priuat ghost it were, or sprite that in that mountaine dwelles, Or seruant from his father sent, but slaughters downe he felles Of sheepe number fiue, and fiue of swyne full large of syse, And mighty hefers blacke in number fiue, as is the gyse. And wines in bolles he shed, and on the mighty soule he cried, Of great Anchises ghost, and sprite that ouer ground was spied. His mates also full glad, as euery man was sped of store, Their offring presents brought, and laded altars more and more, And hefers downe they slew, and som by rowes their pans of brasse Did set to seeth in sight, and downe they spred them selues on grasse, On vmbles fat they feede, and broche, and broyle, and time they passe. And now the ninth desired day was come with morning bright, And Phœthons horses faier had mounted vp the sonne to sight, And by the fame, and for Acestes worship round about The contreys all were come, and shores they ful with ioyfull rout Wagers for rowinge.To see the Troian lords, and some in minde themselfes to trie. First prises great in sight, aloft a bancke, aduaunced hie, Were set amids them all, three footed bolles of precious mold, And crownes and garlonds gay, for them that win the wager shold. And poudryd purple robes, and armor gorgeous glistring bright, And talents great of gold, and plenty plate of siluer pight. With glee the game begins, the trompet blows with noise on hight. First vessels foure, that cheife elected were from all the fleete, Auncetors of certeine y? noblest m? in Rome when he wrot this booke.Come forth to coape with Ores of hugy weight as matches meete. Syr Mnesteus his galeon swift whose name was Pistrin, driues, Syr Mnesteus Italian prince, whence Memmus lyne deriues. Syr Gias than with hugy monster ship Chimera calde, A cities worke she was, with ranckes of rowers treble walde, And Troian youth with triple tyre of Ores did shoue the same. Sergestus than, from whom the house of Sergis drawes the name, Centaurus him did beare (that galee great.) But Scylla blew Cloantus brought, from whence thy race (O Romain Cluent) grew. Far out in seas there stands a rocke against the fomy shore, That sometime vnder water lyeth with surges beaten sore, Whan stormes of winter winde encloseth stars in cloudy skies, But smooth in calme it lieth, and in the mids therof doth rise A pleasant plaine of feeld, where often Mewes, and birds of seas Do keepe their haunting walke, and sun their fethers whan they pleas. Aeneas there aduauncing set a signe of braunches greene, A marke of oken bows, that of the boatmen might be seene, To know their turning place, and courses long from whence to folde. Eche man by lot their standing tooke, and glistring bright in golde, The gorgeous capteins stood, on hatches hie in garmentes gay. The rest of youth with crownes of garlonds greene in due aray, Their neckes and shoulders shine with oyles annointed naked bare, On fettels downe they sit, their Ores in hands prepared are, Their armes ententiue bent, whan at the signe they shall begin. Their harts for ioy doth hop, and fear doth flap their brests within, And greedy pride of praise, and feruent loue renown to win. Than whan the blast of trompet first doth sound, they all arise Atones, and from their bounds they breake, their clamors perce y? skies, Their stroks at ones they strike, the fomy waters through they cliue, The stremes resisting breake, and with their stems the seas they sliue, Their ores w? labor creaks, by strength of armes themselfs they driue. Not headlong halfe so swift, doth coursing steedes bestir their heeles, Whan for their wager fast with all their force they flie with wheeles. Nor charet gyder non more free on feeld doth let them slip, Or slacker shakes his raines, or louder them doth lash with whip: Than with the shoutes of men that clap their hands, and parties takes, The cries encreasing rise, that euery wood with sounding shakes. The noyse repulsed ronnes from banck to banck, and through the shores The voices broken ben, and hill to hill rebounding rores. Before them all sir Gias first escapes through all the throng, And first to seas he flies with noise, and him Cloanthus strong Pursues at hand, and better was with ores, but sluggish keele And mast vnweldy lets. Than after him euen hard at heele, Centaurus preasing glides, and Pistris her doth equall matche, They striue with sturdy strokes, and formost place they seeke to catche. And now Centaurus gets the vauntage, now doth Pistris win: Now ioyntly both, with side to side, and equall speede they spin. And now approching neere the rocke they were, and marke they held, Whan Gias victor prince, (of conquest proud) the land beheld. And as from chanell deepe his barge to land he would haue hied: Unto Menetes lodesman than therof full loud he cried. Why roust away so wide? take here I say, loue nie the shore, Fetch mee this left hand land, and on these rocks let beat thine Ore. Let others keepe the deepe, he said, but fearing rocks, and sholdes, Menetes still at sterne his hand on helme to seaward holdes. Where yet astray so wide? yet (whan I bid thee) fetche the stones, Sir Gias on Menetes cried and cald, and (lo at ones) Hee seeth Cloanthus come, euen hard at backe, and formost glide, He through the roaring rockes, and vnderneth sir Gias [illeg.]ide Did sheare his lefthand way, betweene them twaine, and swift anon Escapes them both, and suer in seas beyond the marke is gon. Than verily for feruent wo, the yong mans bones did glowe, Nor teares his eyes could hold, but by and by Menetes slowe Menetes is cast ouer bord (Forgetting worship all, and that he was his helpe at helme,) Yet hedlong down he threw, and him in seas did ouer whelme, Him selfe to sterne he stept, him selfe his maisters roume supplies, Exhorting men with noyse, and fast to shoreward helme he wries. But whan (good aged man) Menetes vp was cast on brim, From botom deepe of seas, and in his garmentes wet did swim, He caught the rocke on hie, and on the drie land there he sat. The Troians had good game, and sporting all they laught therat, Whan first in seas he fell, and whan he rose and flat did fleete, And whan to pourge his gorge he kest vp floods of salt on sweete. Than hope and comfort kindled is vnto the twaine behinde. Sir Mnesteus and Sergestus strong, they both with burning minde Would passe sir Gias by, (that hindred is) and passe they do, Sergestus first the place doth take, and rocke approcheth to, And yet not formost all, nor all her keele hath forhand won, But part before, for halfe with her doth Pistris striuing ron. But kindling fast his mates on euery side sir Mnesteus steeres. From man to man he steps, and chafing vp their corage cheeres, With loude exhorting noise. Now now (quoth he) with might &amp; maine, Now cheerely stur your Ores, now all your force do you constraine. O Hectors worthy peeres, whom I at Troys extreme decay, Did matche to be my mates, and chose with me to take our way, Expresse me now y? might y? somtime brought vs through the streames, And sturdy waues of seas, and sondry gulfes of Greekish realmes. I seeke not now the chiefe, nor of this game renown to bost, (Albeit O,) but let it go where Neptune fauours most. Yet last let vs not bee. O liuely laddes of noble kinde, Let neuer man for shame behold vs last to lag behinde. Now for our contreys loue, (if any thing your hartes reuiues) Now pull or neuer pull. They than at ones all for their liues, Laid on with lusty strokes, the brasen pup with plucking quakes, With strength of arms they striue, y? skudding furth y? stem it strakes. The land aloose withdraws, than pantinge breath doth beat their lims, Their mouths of moisture dry, on streming swet their bodies swims. Fortune also to them desired lucke and honour sent, For as Sergestus (mad in minde for hast) in turning bent Too neere the shore, and straighter would haue cut the shorter space: Among the stones he stack (vnlucky man) in parlous place. The rockes therwith they shoke, and on the craggy pointed pikes Their Ores with crashing breke, &amp; keele on grosid with danger strikes. The boatmen rise with noise, &amp; loude with cries them selues they let And proppes, and pyked poales, with hurlyburly great they get. And some their broken Ores, in peeces fleeting vp they fet. But Mnesteus reioysing than, and proud for this mischaunce, With cluster swift of Ores, and windes at will that did aduaunce, All groweling through y? seas he skouring ronnes, &amp; through the deepes The waues hee smothly cuts, and swift his way on water sweepes: Most like a Doue, whom chaunce distourbyd hath from pleasant rest, That in some corner close within some house, doth keepe her nest, Affraid she sterteth first, and flushing loud she flaps her winges, That all the house resoundes, than vp to skies aloft she springes, And fast to field she flies, where gliding soft in aier aboue, She sheares her tender way, and wing for hast doth neuer moue. So Mnesteus, so Pistris makes her way with might extreeme, So slides she through the seas, and so with force to flye they seeme. And first Sergestus strong, that on the rocke did yet remaine, He leaues him struggling there, and calling helpe full oft in vaine, Among the sholdes, and glad with broken Ores to learne to creepe. Than Gias, than Chimera ship her selfe that monster steepe, He ouertakes, (for of her maister late she spoyled was) And now remaynes there none but sir Cloanthus last to passe, Whom fast he doth pursue, and hard at hand he hath in chase, With power and pith he pulles, and towardes him he drawes a pace. Than noyses dubbled been, and shoutes of friendes exalting cries, Prouoking foorth with prayse, that vp to heauen the clamours flies. They proude of former prayse, their honour won they will not lose. And if they should, no longer than to liue they do dispose. Those other fortune feedes, they thinke to win for win they may. And with the prise (perhaps) or halfe therof had gon their way: Had not Cloanthus to the seas his handes abroad displayed, And cald his gods for helpe, and thus to them full loud he prayed. O Gods that empier keepes on seas, whose kingdomes here I strake, Upon this water shore to you mine altars will I make. A white elected Bull I vowe to giue with seruice braue, And cast his flesh in floods, if I mine honour now may saue. And plenty pure of wines, I will to you in waters throw. He spake that word, and him beneth in botoms deepe by low, The god Portunus heard, and virgin rout of Mermaydes all, And ladies bright that daunsing liues in seas with bodies tall, Him selfe his mighty hand to send her foorth did set behinde. So did the noble water Nimphes, she swifter than, than winde: And swifter glaunsing smooth than arow gliding goeth from bow, To land she leapt, and safe in hauen her selfe she did bestow. Aeneas than eche man in order due let call by name, And sir Cloanthus victor chiefe by Heraldes did proclame. And crowne of Laurell greene about his browes himselfe he set. Than giftes for euery ship, three hefers large he bids to fet, And plenty great of wines, and talents faire of siluer bright. But specially the capteins all with due rewards he dight. A mantell riche to him that wan the chiefe was giuen of gold, Whom purple borders broade enuironned with diuers fold, And wrought therin there standes a princely child of precious face, That in the woods with Dart in hand both Hart &amp; Hinde doth chace, All liuely, breathing like, whom, falling downe from Ioue on hie: The storye of Ganimedes.An Egle feerce vptooke, and in his pawes conueied to skie. His keepers wailing stand, and handes abroad to heauen they hold In vaine, and barking noyse of dogs against the cloudes do skold. But he that second place by doughty deedes deserued had: A harneys coat to him with heauy hookes of gold bestad, A harneys coat he gaue, whom he him selfe in battell broyle Did vnder Troian walles from Demoleus brest dispoyle. That worthy gift he had, and strong defence in armes to weare. Skant yemen twain with shoulders ioyntly set the same could beare, So sondry folde it was, but Demolee him selfe alone, Was wont therin to hunt the stragling Troians one by one. Than for the third renowne, two caudrons great he gaue of brasse, And siluer cups, with signes of stories old engrauen that was. And now rewarded all, eche man full proude in best aray, They went with garnisht heads, and bare their giftes galanta gaye. Whan from the parlous rocke, with much a doo to skape the same, (Besides his losse of Ores, and of a rancke of rowers lame) With laughter great of men, his praiselesse ship Sergestus brought, In maner like, as whan some serpent (by some bancke vnsought) Is brused by some wheele, that ouerthwart his backe hath past: Or pilgrim passing by, with stroke of stone welnere hath brast, In vaine he seekes to flee, and wrigling wreathes his limmes about, His angrie halfe onbroke, and hissing necke he launcheth out All bright with burning eies, and though his limping halfe him holdes: He knits him great in knobbes, and in him selfe him selfe he foldes. None otherwise, and like, with feeble Ores his ship did steere, Yet saile he makes with winde, and into hauen approcheth cleere. Aeneas to Sergestus gaue reward of duety there, Reioysing for the ship, and for the men that saued were. A woman him was geuen, a seruant good to weaue and spinne, And sucking boyes a payer, of Giaunts kinde, her paps betwinne. Than good Aeneas went (whan all this matche discharged was:) Running Into a goodly field, that ouerspred was all with grasse, Whom woods and crooked hilles on euery side did compas round, And in the mids a vale there lay, and pleasant plaine of ground, Where he with thousands thicke did make for playes a seemely plat, And in the mids of all, in stately seat, as prince hee sat. Here they that list to ron, and trie themselues with force of feete, With gifts he them prouokes, and sets before them prises meete. On euery side they came, both men of Troy and Sicill land, Eurialus and Nisus first. Eurialus a springold fresh of youth, and beauty cleere, And Nisus that of all mankind had him in loue most deere, And yong Diores, of king Priams blood a princely childe. Than Salius and Patron auncient stocks and vndefilde. Panopes than, and Helimus, of Sicill, striplings twaine, That hunters were in woods, and men of old Acestes traine. An many more also there came, whom fame in darkenes hides. To whom in middes of all, Aeneas thus his tale deuides. Take this for certaine trueth, and in your mindes conceiue it so, Not one of all this number here shall vnrewarded go. For dartes I will them giue, with pointed steele full bright a paier, And wrought with siluer fine to beare in hand a Pollax faier. All men alike shal here rewarded bee, saue onely three, With bowes of Oliues greene, as victors chiefe shal crowned bee. The first a palfray bright, with harneys gorgeous glistring braue Shall get, the second for his paines a quiuer gay shal haue. A quiuer gay, with girdle broad of gold and arrowes fret, Embroydred fine that is, and precious stones theron are set. The third shall with this Greekish helme depart and be content. Whan this was sayd, their place they teke, and right incontinent, At signe of trompet heard, their bounds they breake, &amp; out they powre, As light as whirling windes, and to the marke in sight they skowre. First and before all other bodies, nimble Nisus springs, More swifter yet than winde, and than the dint of lightnings wings. Next vnto him, but long aloofe, in distance next of place, Doth Salius pursue, and after him a certaine space, Eurialus the thirde. And next Eurialus sir Helimus ensues, and ioyntly than Behold he flies, and heele to heele with him Diores ran, With elbow next and next, and if the race do long remaine, Is like to scape them all, or one to leaue in doubtfull gaine. And towards now the latter end they drew, and wery all, They ran with panting breathes, whan sodenly did Nisus fall. (Unhappy man) where hefers had ben slaine by chaunce on grasse, And ground was slipper made by certaine blood that shed there was. There now the gentle lad, (whan conquest proud he had in hand) His legges he could not hold, nor stombling so, could longer stand, But groueling flat he fell and in the slime embrewd him vile. Yet not Eurialus his freend, did he forget that while: For quickly sterting hee, sir Salius way with foote did stop, That headlong downe in dust he ouerturnid taile and top. Eurialus than springing skudded forth, and through his frend, With ioyfull shoutes of men, he gets the chiefe at races end. Than Helimus and now Diores third in place succeedes. There, whan the lords were set, &amp; ech came forth to claim their meedes: Sir Salius before them all, with noise exclaming cried, And praied his honours dew, that by deceit was him denied. The peoples fauour helpes Eurialus, and comely teares, And vertue found in body fayer the greater grace it beares. Diores eke, that third in wager was, doth him complaine What wrong sustaine he must, and all his course hath ron in vaine, If Salius without desert, the first reward shall haue. Than lord Aeneas said, you shall not neede to striue nor craue, Your prises certaine ben, shall no man them from order steere. Yet let me rue the plight of mine vngilty frend so deere. He sayd, and than a Lyons heauy hyde of combrous folde, To Salius he giues, full rough of hear and pawes of golde. Quoth Nisus than, if such rewards haue folkes that conquerd bee, And pity shew thou doost to falling men, what giftes to mee Shall worthy yelded bee? that chiefest prise did first deserue, Had not enuious fortune mee (as Salius made to swarue. And as hee talked thus, his face he shewd with dirt defilde, And body moist of mud. The noble prince on him than smilde, And bad bring out a shied, a target great full costly wrought, That by the Greekes somtime was for a gift to Neptune brought. That seemely gift he gaue vnto that gentill lad to beare. Whan courses all was past, and all the gifts dispatched were, Now he that manhood hath, or corage bolde doth beare in brest, Fighting w? bags or flaps of lether and lead. Shew forth himselfe, and with his armes in thonges let him be drest. He sayd, and therwithall he sets rewardes of honours twaine. A crowned Bull, all clad with gold, shall be the victors gaine. A sword and sheeld to him that beaten is, shall comfort bee. Nor linger long they doo, but straight with force full huge to see, Aduaunceth Dares forth, with murmour great of men extolde, Alone somtime that durst with Paris fight in armour bolde. He, in the place where Hector most of might entombed lies, Did ouerthrow sir Buten, giaunt big of monstrous sise, That wrastlinges all did win, and Bebrix linage boasted strong, Yet Dares him to death did ouerturne, and laide along. Such one this Dares was, and hie on feeld his head he lifts, And shewes his shoulders broad, and to and fro his armes he shifts, And brags with boistous brawnes, and with his fists he beats y? winde. A matche for him they seeke, but through them all is none to finde, That durst with Dares coape, nor ones his slings with fingers touche. He proud therof, and thinking all mens might to him did couche, Before Aeneas feete he stood, and longer nothing staied, But by the horne in left hand toke the Bull, and thus he sayd. Thou goddesse son, if no man dare come forth to trie with hand, What end of wayting is? How long am I thus bound to stand? Let me rewarded bee, the Troians all did crie the same: And, yeeld vnto the man his promise due they do proclame. Acestes there, as on a bancke by chaunce he next did sit, With these rebukes of speech Entellus old at hart he smit. Entellus, thou sometime of doughty knightes the captaine chiefe, (In vaine) so goodly giftes to lose is it to thee no griefe? How canst thou suffer this? shall from thy side with triall none These worthy prises passe? O where is now our maister gon? Erix our maister good? where is become that glorious fame That Sicill land did fill? and spoyles with thee recordes the same, Within thy halls y? hang, is it for nought thou knewst that game? He theronto, it is not sure for feare (you may well thinke) Nor loue of praise I lacke, nor for no doubt therof I shrinke. But age mee feeble makes, and slouthfull blood congealyd cold, Hath spent my former force, and dull doth make my carcas old. If I had now the strength sometime that was, and yet therwith This yongling proudly brags, if of those yeres I had the pith: Not for the prise, nor for the bull, but gladly, and (onpraid) I would haue come, for gifts I care not for. Whan hee thus said. He brought before them all, of bags onweldy, matches twaine, And threw them downe in sight, wherwith somtime in battail plaine Syr Erix wonted was to giue combat, and hand to hand Against all men to striue, and sturdy strokes he did withstand. Mens hartes astoinid were. Of backs of bulles seuen boistous hides All vnderlaid with lead, and stif of steele they stoode besides. Aboue all other wondreth Dares most, and doth refuse Such great vnlawfull tooles, or in conflict the same to vse. Aeneas eke their massy wondrous weight, and endles fold, He vewd with maruell much, and vp and downe full oft he rold. Than onto him with brest onfayned, spake Entellus old. What if a man had seene the dredfull bags, and wepons sore Of Hercules him selfe? in dolefull fight here on this shore? These tooles thy brother Erix than did beare, with these he stood Against syr Hercules most strong, here yet thou seest the blood, And braines that broken were, thou seest how yet they ben enbrewd. These wepons I somtime (whan better blood my strength endewd) Was wont in vre to put, whan not as yet enuious age, Nor head with hoary heares my lusty corage did aswage. But if this Troian Dares here, these tooles will needes refuse, If so Aeneas please, and mee Acestes will excuse: Let vs matched meete. These Erix bags I pardon thee, Cast of thy feare, and thou of Troian bags onburdend bee. Thus speaking, from his shoulders twaine he kest his garments all, And bare with mighty bones, and mighty ioyntes of membres tall, And sinows great in sight, among them all he stood full stout. Than bags of meaner matche Aeneas prince him selfe brought out, And eche with equall weight and hands of both, he bound and drest. Upright forthwith they stand, and face to face, aduauncing prest, Their arms to heau? they heaue, &amp; void of fear they throw their slings, Eche one from others dints their heads ful boistous backward wrings. And strokes in strokes they mixe, &amp; hands in hands, and fiers they fight, That one with lusty legs, and fresh of youth in shifting light, The other huge in height, and large of lims, but mouing slowe, His trembling knees him lets, &amp; troubled breath doth panting blowe. Full many a wound is geuen between them twain with leaden lomps, And many a stroke in vaine, and on their ribs full thicke it thomps. Their sides within th? sounds, &amp; loud their brests w? bobbings rings, And stil their armes they stur, about their browes the buffets flings, About their eares, &amp; craking both their iawes their weapons swings. Entellus heauy stands, and in his place onmoued bydes, With armes &amp; watching eyes, and for the strokes defence prouides, But hee, as one, that with some engin worke doth siege a towne, Or towre or castle strong, and long therat is beating downe, And this way now, and that way now he seekes, and entries all Assautes with sondry sleyghts, and fayleth yet to breake the wall. Entellus rowsing than, his righthand bent on hie did lift: He from the stroke that came, with good forefight, and body swift Aduoiding shrancke for feare, and from the dint therof declinde. Entellus mist his marke, and all his force he lost in winde, And ouer that, himselfe, with heauy peyse and heauy sound, All groueling flat he fell, and with his lims he spred the ground. None otherwise, than whan some auncient oke and ouergrown, From mountaine top on hie, by vnderminyng down is thrown. The Troians rise for ayde, so doth the youth of Sicill land, To heauen the cries ascend, and first to him with helping hand Acestes swiftly runnes, and from the ground his freend he takes, Of equall age, and in his hart for him great mone he makes. But nothing slacke for this, nor with his fall one whit affright, This valiant knight vpstood, and fiercer yet renewes his fight: And forceing preaseth foorth, &amp; wood for wrath his strength vpsteres, Than shame prouokes his might, and manhood felt of former yeres, And headlong Dares downe, through all the field, he dashing dynges, And now the righthand strokes, &amp; now the lefthand sends the slinges. Nor time, nor rest there is, but as a stormy shoure of hayle, On houses ratling falles: so doth this knight with force assayle, With thondrings thomping thicke, and wery Dares wretch on soyle With both his armes he bumpes, and vpside down doth tosse and toyle. Than lord Aeneas would no longer wrath should in them fret, Nor more Entellus bitter moode on rage he would haue set. But end of fighting made, and tyeryd Dares vp did take, And soft with gentill speech in comfort thus to him he spake. Unhappy man, what fond outrage hath thus possest thy minde? A stronger force than thine, and Gods against thee doost not finde? Giue place to god, he said, and with his word the battell brake. Him dragging weake his legs, and to and fro his head did shake, And casting much at mouth, and cloddrid blood with teeth among, His trusty mates vptooke, and bare to ships away from throng. And than commaunded came, and sword and helmet did receaue, And to Entellus did the Bull and fame of combat leaue. Than bragging proud in minde, and of his Bull conceiuing ioy: O goddesse son behold, and you (quoth he) ye men of Troy, What strength in lusty yeres somtime I had now iudge in mee, And from what death your Dares taken is, now shall you see. He spake that word, and right afront before the Bull he stood, That there for gift was set, and vp the slinges with corage good In righthand marking held, and iust betweene the hornes at ones He strake, and brake the braines, and all in peeces droue the bones. The beast is ouerthrown, and groueling dead on ground it quakes. He stamping therupon, with feruent minde his praier makes. This better soule to thee for Dares death I victor send, (O Erix) here of bags, and all mine art I make an end. ShootingAnon Aeneas them that list contend with arowes wight, For wagers he prouokes, and sets before them giftes in sight. And from Sergestus ship aduauncing huge in height a mast, He hanges a pigeon there, and by a cord he made her fast, A marke for men to shoote, and where their darts they should direct. Assembly great there came, and by their lots they were elect, In brasen helmet cast, and first of all with ioyfull cryes, Unto Hippocon worthy lad by draught the lot doth rise. Next whom sir Mnesteus, that late at seas was victor seene, Syr Mnesteus with crowne and garlond gay of Olyue greene. Eurition was third: (thy brother deere thou noble knight O Pandarus, that didst somtime the league asonder smight, And first commaunded didst, among the Greekes thy wepon throw) Acestes last of all, and last in helmet lay by lowe. Him selfe also with hand, the yong mens game did not disdaine. Than bending all their bows, with corage great they do constraine, And eche to serue him selfe from quiuer draweth his tooles amaine. And first from sounding string along by heauen his arow driues Hippocon lusty lad, and swift therwith the skies he cliues. It lightes apace, and in the mids the mast it stacke and staied. The tree with trembling shooke, and of the stroke the bird afraied, Did flickring flush her wings, and noyse there riseth round about. Than Mnesteus his bowe to drawe, forthwith with strength stoode out, And stretching hand aloft, his dart and eye did leuel right, Yet could not he (good man) for all his art the culuer smight. But hyt the hemping corde, and of the knot the bandes he brast, Wherby the byrd was bound, and by her foote did hang at mast. She toke the winde forthwith, and to the cloudes full fast he flew, And euen that time (as he his bowe and dart directing drew) Eurition, and for his brothers helpe in heauen, he cried: The byrd he saw was lose, and sporting her in skies he spied. Yet marking well with eies, and stedfast hand, in cloudes aboue, He quickly brake her play with sodeyn stroke, and slew the Doue, That tumbling downe she fell, and in the stars her life she last, And dead she came to ground, and in her body brought the shaft. Acestes than alone, with no desert did yet remaine, Who nerethelesse his dart to hurle in ayer did him distraine, And shewd his former might, and of his bowe to proue the sound. There sodenly his eyes a wondrous monster did confound, And token sore of things, as afterward the end did teache, And all to late for nought their fearfull songs did prophets preache. For as in tender cloudes his arow swift from him did flie, In sight it caught a fier, and flaming forth it went in skie. And wasted thin in winde, as oftentimes we thinke do slyde, The fixed stars of heauen, with drowping tayles along that glyde. Astoinid all they stood, and on their Gods aboue they prayed, Sicilians and Troians both, nor he him selfe denayed Aeneas peerelesse prince, to take that same in signe of grace. But glad with great rewards, he did Acestes thus embrace. Most noble father deere, (for by these tokens well I see, The mighty kinge of heauen for thy good will doth honour thee,) Thou shalt haue here a gift of olde Anchises freend of thine, A drinking bolle of gold, that portraied is with figures fine. Which vnto him somtime, Cisseus, great of Thrase the kinge, In token gaue of loue, for euermore with him to bringe. So spake he, and with Laurell greene his temples twaine he tied, And loude before them all Acestes victor chiefe he cried. Nor good Eurition did his preferment ought enuie, Though he alone it were, that brought againe the byrde from skie. Aduaunced next with giftes was he that cord a sonder brast, And last of all was he that with his arow strake the mast. Than lorde Aeneas, ere these matches all dissolued were, Epitides to him, Ascanius mate and keeper there, He calde, and rounding thus to him he spake in secret eare. Go bid Ascanius (if by this time he the childerns crue Assembled hath with him, and horses put in order due) Before his graunsire here let him bring out his bands in rowe, For worship of this feast, and let him selfe in armour showe. Dispatch (quoth hee) with speede, the people than he bids deuide, The children com w? their triumpheAnd broader spread them selues, &amp; made a lane both long and wide. Than come the childern foorth, and proud before their parents sight In order seemely shine, on barbed coursers brideled bright, Whom for their fresh aray, and comly marching through the felde, The youth of Sicill land, and Troians all with ioy behelde. Eche one as was their gyse, with rounded hear, and garlond bands, And horny dartes a paier, with poynted steele they bare in hands, With quiuers light at backes, and downe their breasts in diuers folde, About their gorgets runnes, the rolling cheines of wreathed golde. Three bandes of horsmen were, &amp; captaynes three their bands did gide, And rankes of riders three, and childern twelue on euery side In glistring armour went, with maisters like and equall peeres. One ward of stronger youth, whom trim triumphant fearce of yeeres, Did Priam yong conduct (thy noble childe Polites fall, That of his gransirs name encrease Italians shortly shall.) A valiant steede him bare, bespotted white, of kinde of Thrace, And white his foote before, and lifting white his lofty face. Another trowpe there was, that litle Atis giding lad, The litle Atis, whom Ascanius small for darling had, From whence the line at Rome of Atis name doth now proceede. Than last of all, and most of beauty bright, and precious weede, Ascanius himselfe on palfray gorgeous borne aboue, Whom vnto him somtime Queene Dido gaue for pledge of loue. The rest of youth, and such as were of olde Acestes trayne: On horses fayer they rode. The Troians them did chere, and did receiue with wondrous ioy, And in their mindes conceiue resemblaunce old of former Troy. Whan mustred all they had, and all the feeld had compast round, And vewd Anchises tombe, they ioyned all on equall ground, Epitides to them with noyse and whipping gaue a sound. They coursing brake their bands, and three from three disseuered all, By matches halfe from halfe, and fast againe they turne at call, With wepons brest, to breast and compas round returninge met, By coursings bickring braue, and race with race entangling let, Inuading skyrmish wise, and like the face of battall fight. And now retire they done, now shew their backes in signe of flight. Now turning throw their darts, now truce they make w? hand in hand, Like Labirinthus maze, that men report in Candy land, Is compast deepe in ground with sondry walls, and crokings blinde, And thousand wandring waies, and entries false for men to finde, Where tokens none there bee, nor skape can none that steps astray, Such turnings them begiles, and so deceytfull is their way. None otherwise, the Troian youth by coursings round about, Disporting chace them selues, and windinges weaue both in and out. Like Dolphin fishes light, that for their pastime daunsinge swim, In mids of deepest seas, and play them selues on water brim. This kinde of pastime first, and custome boyes to learne at Baase, Howe play of Baase come vp. Ascanius whan Alba walles he made did bring in place, And taught the Latines old, in solempne sort to vse the same, As he sometime a child, with Troian youth had made that game. The Albans than from thence with practise like their children taught, And thence hath perelesse Rome and most of might, y? custome caught. And for their contreys loue, with honor due this day it standes, And yet the name remaynes of Troyan boyes, and Troian bandes. Thus farforth worshipt was, his father deere with seruice due. There fortune false to trust, did turne their case with chaunges newe. For, as about Anchises tombe with playes the time they spent: A newe vexation by Iuno.Dame Iuno downe from heauen the Rainbowe read her seruant sent, Reuoluing former griefe, and rancours old not yet from minde, Against the Troian fleete, and as she went she gaue her winde. She swiftly bent her bowe, &amp; through the clouds with thousand hewes, Full virginlike she falles, her new deuise onknown, to vse. A huge concourse she seeth, and compas wide she vews the strandes, How bare the hauons are left, and nauy dry defenceles stands. But secret by them selues, the Troyan wiues assembly kept, And for Anchises losse lamenting sore they stood and wept Beholding broad the seas: alas, alas, O wretches wee, So much of boistous waues remaines vs yet that wery bee? A towne to dwell they craue, and of the seas abhor the payne, Eche one to other wayles, and all with one voice do complayne. Dame Rainbowe subtile there, amids them all her selfe did place, Her garmentes gay she left, and laid a side her goddesse face, And of Doriclus wife the likenes toke, a sober dame, That sometime great renown, and children bare of noble fame, And Beroe was cald, and thus to them she did proclame. O women misers most, whom hands of Greekes would neuer kyll, O cursed nation, whan of thee shall fortune haue her fill? What death, or mischiefe more are we thus kept to bide at last? Since Troy vproted was, now sommers seuen are comen and past, That we through seas and lands, and contreys all (the world beside) To straungy stars of heauen, and endles streames we wander wide, In seekinge land that fleeth, and wee alway with surges tost. Here is our contrey ground, here dwels Acestes deere our host. Why should we hence remoue? who lets vs here our walles to bilde? O former natiue soyle, O contrey gods (in vaine exilde) Shall neuer Troy vpryse? shall citie Troian neuer bee? Those Hectors holsome streames shal I from henceforth neuer see? Come on good wiues, come burne with mee these ships of luck vnkinde, For so Cassandra through my dreame apeering did mee binde. And gaue me burning bronds, seeke here (quoth she) your Troian walls, Here lieth your contrey rest, this is the time that fortune calls, What neede we longer looke? lo Neptunes altars foure on fier, Lo god himselfe (you see) with mindes and might doth vs enspier. Thus talked shee, and with a brond in hand full fierce she sprang, With (whirling loofe aloft) against the fleete the same she flang. The rest amazed were, their hartes astoinid stood with rage. Than one among them all, dame Prigo matrone most of age, King Priams nurse that was, and princely children vp did reare. Not Beroe (quoth she) this woman is, you wiues I sweare, Nor neighbor none of ours, behold what beauty bright deuine, What liuely sprite she beares, and marke me well her glistring eyen, Her loke, her sounding voice, and of her pace the great estate. I left dame Beroe my selfe at home full sicke but late, Full sicke lamenting sore that she her selfe from vs alone, This day must absent be, and yeld Anchises worship none. This spoken: Therwith the matrons first, with wauering mindes began to dout, And with peruersid eyes beheld the nauy round about. And what betweene the loue of present land, and present rest, And fame of fatall realmes: they wot not which of them is best. Whan lifting vp her selfe to clouds aboue with equal wings, In flight before them all, with bowe full broad the goddesse springs. Than verily with monsters wilde affright, and mad for yre, They cry to burne their ships, &amp; from their tentes they reaue the fire. Some spoile their altar piles, &amp; burning bows, &amp; stickes and brandes, Abourd the ships they spreede, vpleapith flame with loosid bandes, On hatches, decks, and Ores, and plancks anointed thicke on sides. Unto Anchises tombe, Eumelus post with panting rides, And shews the ships are brent, and they them selues beholding spie, The sparcklings rising broad, and blustring smoke to spred in skie. And first Ascanius as coursings still he kept and plaied, He toke the campe in hast, and with vprore was all dismayed, Nor for their liues his maisters him could hold, or backeward send. What sodeyn rage is this? where now (quoth hee?) what do ye entend? O neighbors, wretched wiues, your enmies host you haue not heere, This is no Greekish campe, you burne your owne reliefe most deere. Lo I Ascanius your owne, and downe his helmet kest, Wherwith in bataill playes, he for disport that time was drest. Aeneas eke with hast, and Troians, all therto them sped, But stragling diuers wayes, through all the shores the women fled, To woods, and mountaine caues, and holes of rockes they miching ron, And creeping hide them selues, repenting foule their worke begon, Abhorring sight of heauen, and on their freends they thinke and quake, With better chaunge of minde, and from their brest dame Iuno shake. But not therfore the flames, nor burning rage the lesser spreedes, But catching still encrease, it more and more preuailing breedes. And spitting spewes a smoke, whom vapor wild of pitche and towe, And dropping timber feedes, and mischiefe close in keele doth growe, Nor might of men can helpe, nor water floods that on they throwe. Aeneas from his shoulders than his garments tearing brast, And calde his gods for helpe, and broad to heauen his handes did cast. Almighty Ioue, if not as yet all Troians from thy minde Reiected ben to death, if seruice old of poore mankinde Not vtterly be lost: now saue these ships from burning fier. Good father now, preserue these Troyan goods, and small desier, Or thou thy selfe (which one thing yet remaines) with lightning fell Here whelme me down to death, if I deserue, and driue to hell. Skant spoken were these words, whan ratling storme not seene before, And raine downraging falles, and thonders thicke doth romblinge rore, That tremblith hils &amp; fieldes, down rolle the skies in gushing shoures, The shyps are are saued by rayne.And troublous water streames from all y? heauen the tempest powres: That ships therwith are filde, &amp; burning bourds are quenched quite, And still descending driues, and on the fleete with force doth smite, Till smoke was ceassyd all, and all the ships from plage was kept. So saued all they were (by gift of god) but foure except. But lord Aeneas whom this great mischaunce did pinche at brest, With heaps, of hugy cares, now this, now that, was sore opprest, Reuoluing much in minde: should he remaine in Sicill lond Forgetting destnies all, or still go seeke Italia strond. Than father Nautes old, whom goddesse Pallas learned had, With artes of worship great, and famous name of wisdome sad: These answers him did tell, which either gods eternall yre, Or fatell destnies wrought, or fortunes course did so requyre, And thus with freendly speeche Aeneas minde he set on fire. O goddesse son, where destnies drawes and driues let vs go there, What euer it is, who conquer fortune will, must fortune beare. Thou hast Acestes here, of Troyan blood and stocke deuine, His counsell take to thee, and ioyne with him aduise of thine. And leaue with him those people which thy ships can not receyue, And such as of thy great affaires no corage doth conceiue, Both aged feeble folkes, and wiues of seas that wery bee, And all that fearfull is, or weake of strength should comber thee, Let them be chosen foorth, and here on gods name citie frame, And of Acestes name, Acesta they shal call the same. Incensid so by this (for from his freend this councell past) Than verily from care to care his minde discoursed fast. And night with darknes dim, the poles of heauen had vndercast. That time his fathers face descending downe, in vision cleere, From heauen appering came, and sodenly thus did him cheere. My son, more deere to mee than life sometime, whan life I had, My son, whose vertues Troy doth trie, by destnies good and bad, Commaunded here I come, from mighty Ioue in skies aboue, That comfort sent at last, and from the fleete did fire remoue. Obey the counsels good, which faithfull Nautes thee hath told, And for Italia land, pike out of a youth of corage bold, To take with thee to seas: an eger nation feers and tough Thou hast to vainquish there, and must subdue in batailes rough. Yet first Auerna caue, and vnder ground the dwellings grim, Of Lymbo must thou see, and dangers passe of darknes dim. And thence ascend to mee, for I (my son) am not in hell, Nor with no wicked kinde of woful ghostes haue I to dwell. But fieldes of pleasure pure, and Paradise doth me retaine, With ioyfull sort of foules, in blisfull state that do remaine. There Sibly pure, by offrings blacke of beastes shall thee conduct, And there thine ofspring all, and fortunes all I shall thee instruct. And now farewel, for midnight moist her half course hence doth wrethe, And dawning day with blast of horses, hote on mee doth breathe. He spake, and thin from sight as smoke, in skies disperst he styed. Sprites can not abide the daylight. What now? where gost away? why doost thou shrinke? Aeneas cried. Whom fleest thou thus? or who from sweet embracings vs withst?ds? Thus talked hee, and from the dust he steres the sleeping brandes, And Troian sacred fier of Gods that euermore doth dure, And offred simple floure, and frankinsens, in plenty pure. Strayt for his mates he cald, and first onto Acestes old Commaundments great of Ioue, and what his father deere had told, He shewes before them all, and wherunto his minde enclines. Nor counsell long they make, nor good Acestes ought repines. A towne they measure foorth, and wiues and people there they plant Of baser hartes, deseruing worship small, for corage skant. Themselues their ships repare, and burned bourdes anew restores, And cables meete they make, &amp; shrowdes and sailes, &amp; strength of Ores. A youth of number few, but liuely bluddes in batayll tough. Therwhiles, Aeneas did the cities plat describe with plough, And houses laid by lot, here Ilian toures, here gates of Troy He sets, and of his kingdome new Acestes maketh ioy. And market place he made, and lawes he taught and iudges gaue. Than large and broad in sight right nere the stars, a temple graue To Venus founded is, in hiest place, and priest deuine To serue Anchises tombe, and sacred groue theron to shine. And now nine dayes this people feasted had, and altars all Applied with offringes due, and sunne had made the sea to fall, And sound of pipling winde, eftsones to deepe their ships doth call: A wondrous weeping noise through all the shores is reised wide, And all that night and day they tween themselues embracing byde. The matrones now themselues that of the seas were earst affraied, And dowted labours long, and of their strength dispairing staied, Now gladly go they will, and trauailes all sustaine at seas. Whom good Aeneas did his best with frendly speeche to apeas, And weeping did commend vnto Acest his kinsman deere. Three Calues to Erix than, and to the stormes a lambe full cleere, He bids for offring kill: and cables loose through all the strandes. Him selfe with garland fresh, and crownet greene of Oliue handes, Aduancing stood in ship, and bolle in hand he held on hie, And flesh in floods he threw, and wines in plentie kest in skie. Behinde them blowes a coole, and winde at will them forth doth driue, His mates they skom the fome, and saltsea brine to turne they striue. But Venus in this while, whom care for Troians fore did straine, To Neptune straight she came, and thus to him began to plaine. The greeuous wrath of Iunos brest, whom no reuenge can slake, Compels mee (Neptune) now to the, all humble sute to make. Whom neither length of time, nor pitie none, from rancor staies, Nor destnies order none, nor Ioue him selfe one whit she waies. She thinkes it not ynough the Troians towne to haue downe torne, And all their last remaine with turmentes long almost forlorne, The bones and pouder poore she persecutes, and all their broode She would destroy, let her declare one cause of such a moode. Thy selfe can record beare, how in the waues of Lyby coast, What wild vprore she made, and seas and skies turmoyling tost. With stormes of Aeolus her freend, and all with labour vaine, So bold within thy kingdomes thus to do. O vile despite, lo yet of late how Troyan wiues in fume She made their ships to burne, and foule their nauy to consume, And leaue their kinred there, in contrey straunge vnknowne to bide. There is no more, but let vs now (I pray thee) saufly ride In sayling through thy seas, let vs arriue where Tyber flowes, If graunted things I axe, if destnies vs those kingdomes showes. Than spake Neptune, that hie seas doth control with lordly browes. Good reason Venus is, that in my kingdomes thou be bolde, From whence thy linage leades, I haue deserued eke of olde. Full oftentimes ere this, both seas and skies vnkindly rage I bridling couched haue, and madnes wood did oft aswage. Nor lesse my care on land, as all the streames of Troy can tell, Was for Aeneas thine, whan fierce Achilles did compell His throngs in field to fall, whan thousands thick down tombling dead He vnder Troyan walls with slaughter wood did trampling tread. That brokes and riuers cried, whan peoples heaps their chanels filde, Nor fall to seas they could, nor finde their waies for bodies kilde. I from Achilles than, Aeneas thine, full sore bestad In fight, (that neither force with him nor gods indiffrent had) Conueyd away by cloud, whan peece from peece I would haue torne, (Mine owne handworke y? was) the walls of Troy so false forsworne. And now also that minde with me remaines, cast of thy dreede, In hauons where thou doost wish he shal ariue right sause with speede. One only man shall bee, whom lost in deepe seas he shall seeke, One poll shall walke for all. Whan he the goddesse brest with speaking thus had put from care, As prince his horses proud hee cupling set and bound in chare, With fomy bridlyng bittes, and lowsing gaue them all the raines, Full smooth his charet slide, and blew sea brim it skantly straines. Down sinke the surginge waues, &amp; great sea swolne in thondry skies, Doth couche their waters close, from all the heauen the catches flies. Than sondry fourmes and faces shew them selues, on weldy whales, And mossy Glaucus grey, and mankinde monsters voyd of skales, And Pollantines, and armies broade of Seales, and Dolphins blew, And Tritons blowe their Trumpes y? sounds in seas w? dropping flew. Dame Thetis lefthand keepes, and daunce doth lead of Mermaydes all, And Ladyes bright, that leaping liues in seas with bodies tall. There Lord Aeneas secret minde a sodaine ioy did fetche, He bids them reyse their Mastes, and all their sayles abroad to stretch. Together to their tacles all they step, and slacking lines, To Larbourd now they set, and now to Starbourd sayles enclines, And haling hoyse their wings, y? shrowds &amp; hookes &amp; bowlines bendes, Palinure his principall pylot.And swift in seas they swim, the windes them selues their nauy sends. But prince and pilot chiefe, sir Palinure his course doth beare, Before them all, and eche to marke at him commaunded were. And now fr? heauen y? drowping night her mid course nere had past, And folkes in slumber sweete, their wery limmes on rest had cast, And Mariners had layd them selues on hatches hard of bars: Whan lightinge swift, from skies the God of sleape did fall from stars, And brake the darke of night, with glimsing shade of fayned beames. To thee (O Palinure) and brought to thee right heauy dreames, Without desert, and on the pup full hie his seate did take, Resembling Phorbas face, and vnto him these wordes he spake. Freend Palinure, lo how the tydes them selues conueys the fleete, This gale by measure blowes: an houre of rest to take is meete. Lay downe thy head, and steale thy painfull eyes one nap of sleepe, I will for thee my selfe supply thy rowme thy helme to keepe. Whom aunswerd Palinure, skant lifting eyes for slumber deepe. Know I not yet my seas? what? thinkst thou mee so small of wit, To trust this fawning face? shall I my lorde and prince commit, To this inconstant beast? should I beleeue that monster wilde? So oft as I with flattring seas, and skies haue ben begilde? Such things he spake, and holding hard at helme he cleauid fast, And still did serue the streames, and still on stars his eyes did cast. Behold, the God on him a dropping braunch of Lymbo pyt With deadly sleeping dewe, on both his temples dashing smyt. And struggling to resist, his swimming eyes with sleepe opprest. Skant first resolued were his weery limmes with sodeyn rest, And leaning noddid lowe: whan halfe the pup with him he drew, And rother helme, and all, in myds of seas he falling threw Quite hedlong ouer bourd, and calling oft his mates in vaine. The God than toke his winges, and thin in winde he went againe. Yet nerethelesse therfore, with safe conduct their fleete did pas, And careles ronnes their course, as god Neptunes promise was. And now they entring were the straytes, Sirenes rockes that hight, A parlous place sometime, and yet with bones of people whight. Than breaking broad the floods, the saltsea stones full hoarce did sound, Whan lord Aeneas felt his ship to stray and maister dround. And toke himselfe the giding than therof in seas by night, Lamenting much in minde his freends mischaunce and heauy plight. O Palinure, that flattring seas and skies to much didst trust, All naked on some straungy sand onburied lye thou must. DEO GRATIAS. Per Thomam Phaer, in foresta Kilgerran finitum .iiij. Maij. Anno, 1557. post periculum eius karmerdini. Opus xxiiij. dierum. THE SIXT BOOKE OF the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. When Aeneas was come to Cunias, he went vnto Sybillas den, where doing sacrifice according to the custome: hee asketh counsel at the Oracle of Apollo, &amp; there learneth both the dangers at hand, &amp; the successe of future wars. Misenus body which he found on the shore he burneth, his furniture, and spoyles he buryeth vnder the next hill, which therof was called Misenus. From thence, by directi? of Dooues, he was brought to the golden boughe, which being gathered, &amp; hauing worshipped and appeased the infernall gods with slaine sacrafice: by conduct of Sibylla he goeth downe to hell, through the mouth of Auernus. He findeth Palinurus wandringe about the lake of STYX, bycause his body was vnburied, &amp; when Sibylla had refused to take him ouer vnto the farther shore, which he requested: Aeneas putteth him in good comfort with exequies, &amp; hope of honorable burial. Fr? thence Aeneas passing ouer Styx, and casting Cerberus in a sleape with a medcined sop, takinge his iourney through the place of Infantes, aud of such as were wrongfully condemned, and put to death vnderseruedly: he cometh vnto the seats of those, y? through impaciencie of loue, had shortned their owne dayes, where espying Dido, when he would haue purged him selfe vnto her: disdaynfully she auoyded his sight. Then departing thence, he came to the habitation of those that were somtime famous in war, where he saw Deiphobus torne, and rent with many wounds, and is there by by him enformed by what cruell &amp; shamefull meanes he came to his death. Afterward, leauing Tartarus on the left hand, and being by Sibylla instructed in the punishments of the wicked: he approacheth nigh the walles of Pluto, &amp; there sticketh vp the golden bough euen in the Queenes entrie, and from thence he proceedeth to the fields of the blessed and is by Musæus brought vnto his father. There Anchises declareth vnto his sonne Aeneas the order, and succession of the Albane, and Romane kinges, and running ouer the names of certen of the Romane nobilitie: cometh to the commendation of Iulius, and Augustus Cæsars, and wonderfully extolleth Marcellus the sonne of Octauia, who was sodenly cut of by vntimely death. Then going forth through the Iuery gate vpon the earth: visiteth his mates and leauing Cumas, sayleth to Caieta. Were he c?meth to Italy at Cumas. So talked hee with teares, and to his fleet he gaue y? raines, And at the last on Cumas coast Italia land attaines. Their forships all fr? seabourd than they turne and ankers strong They pitching laid a land, and all the croked shores along Their ships in order set, out leapes the youth with long desier To tread Italia land, some seeke for seedes of lurking fier In secret vaines of flints, some breake the beds of beastes onkinde, And reauing spoile their dennes, some shew what woods, what floods they find. He visits y? temple of Apollo at Cumas, where Sibylla that time did prophecy. Dedalus made the temple at Cumas. Diuerse histories grauen vpon the walies. Citie of Athenes. But good Aeneas to Apollos church, and temple towres, He went to seeke the secret caue of Siblyes dreedfull bowres. A vaute of widenes wast, where mighty sprite, and mighty minde Apollo her inspires, that all thing knowes in secret kinde. And things that fatall ben he doth to her full broad vnfolde. And now the sacred groues they see, and houses bright of golde. By old report whan Dedalus from Minos kingdoms fled, With bold attempt of wings he toke the skies hie ouerhead, And Northward fast he flew, a passage straunge vnseene before, And lighting downe at last, hee stood a land on Cumas shore. There he ariued first, and there (O Phœbus bright to thee) Did consecrate his wings, and made a temple huge to see. Upon the doores Androgeos death there stands, than yeere by yeere How Athens was compeld, (a wretched thing,) their children deere By couples seuen and seuen, both sonnes, &amp; doughters bound in bands, To send to slaughter vile, the pot with lots there redy stands. Right theragainst in seas doth Candy kingdoms answer full, There Pasiphee was made, and next to her there stood the Bull Pasiphae wyfe to King Minos of Candy. A m?ster half man half bull. With tokens foule of loue, and how by stelth, in metall thin She vnderlay that beast, with stinking lust of lothsome sin. And Minotaure there was, the mongrell vile of mixed kinde, Inclosed kept in maze, where issue none there was to finde. There lay the labour sore, and wandring house of endles wayes, In corners crooking darke, a wofull worke for them that straies. But Dedalus, that pitie did the Queenes outragious loue, Him selfe the craft did teache, and dangers all he did remoue, By giding through the darke her passage blinde by threde full fine. Icarus son to Dedalus flew from Candy w? his father and was drowned by y? way in the sea, now called therof mare Icarium. And thou O Icarus also among those workes deuine Hadst had no slender part, if sorowes him not letted had. Two times in shining golde, thy drowing fall with hart full sad Thy father there began, and twise his hands for fainting fell. These stories olde, and things of former fame right long to tell They should haue ouervewd, whan (sent of purpose there before) Achates did returne, and brought the priest with head full hoare, That seruid Phœbus church, and did Dianas offrings make, And Deiphobe she hight, and to the king these wordes she spake. This time requireth not with gasing thus to linger there, Now hefers seuen to kill, to serue the gods more wisdome were. And seuen of chosen sheepe (as custome is) you should haue brought. Discription of Siblyes caue in y? temple &amp; how she prophecied at certain houres by fits. The saide caue yet remaines.These things she spake, &amp; they forthwith her iust c?ma?dment wrought Than she the Troian lords into the temple gorgeous calles. A caue there is, cut out in rocke, euen through the temple walles, Both huge and broad at mouth, a hundred vautes, a hundred doores, A hundred roarings sound, whan Siblyes answers beates the floores. Before the same they stood, whan she the virgin close within, Deskried her selfe and spake. Now doth (quoth shee) my time begin To learne at god, lo here comes god. As she thus babling prates, All sodenly, with faces more than one, before the gates, And colours more than one, disfigured wild she stood in traunce. Her hear vpsterting stands, her trembling brest doth panting praunse, Her hart outraging swells, nor mortallyke she lokes at last: Aboue mankind she speakes, whan of the god she self the blast No grace without prayer.In sprite approching neere. And standst thou still, and doost not pray, Thou Troian thou? (quoth she) &amp; standst thou still? shall not this day One doore disclose it selfe till prayer come. Whan shee thus sayd, She silence made: than quaking cold in Troians limmes affrayd Aeneas oration to Phœbus &amp; to Siblye.Did ron through all their bones, &amp; thus their king ful humbly prayd. O Phœbus, whom the painefull toyles of Troy did euer greeue, Thou that sir Paris hand and dart (poore Troians to releeue) Directing didst conduct, and gauest Achilles mortall wound, Thus many mightie seas that mighty landes encompas round I entred haue by thee, through nations wilde, and parlous strands, Through coasts of mountaine Moores, and contreys close of Sirtes sands. And now Italia shore (alwayes that shrancke) we touche at last, Thus farforth now haue we through dangers all our fortune past. And you also your indignations great is time to end, You gods and goddesses eche one, whom Troy did ought offend With glory great of pryde, eke thou, (O sacred prophet trewe) That fortunes doost forsee, (I aske nothing but kingdoms due That destny doth me giue,) Italia land let vs enioye, Our wandring gods to place, and relikes deere outcast of Troye, Than I, to Phœbus cleere and to Diana, temples pure Of marble stone shall make, and feastes that euermore shall dure. This was acc?plished afterward, &amp; in Rome there wer ten interpreters of Siblyes bokes, called Dec? viri Sibyllini, w? a college of y? same. Sibyl resisted til y? sprite c?pelled her. Siblyes voice. Rewardes also to thee, and offrings great for thee shall stand Within my kingdomes all, and I my selfe shall out of hand Enrolle thy sacred lots, and dities deere of holy rimes. My people shall them learne, and chosen men at standing times Shall consecrated be, thy mighty minde that shall expound. Do thou this time thy selfe thy verses speake with perfit sound, Nor write no line in leaues, lest whirling wind therwith may play, Confounding then from course, and lest in skies they flie their way. He ended thus. Speake thou (quoth he) thy selfe I humbly pray. But wrastling wild as yet, against the god in thentry large Dame Sibly mombling made, and strugling strong withstood y? charge, If haply so she might the gods enforcing shake from brest. But he preuailing still, with more and more her spite opprest. Her hart, her raging mouth, he taming stayed and fixed fast. And now along the caue, a hundred dores were open brast Of proper strength, &amp; through the vaute these answers out she cast. O thou that dangers great of seas at last hast skaped all, But greater things on land remaines for thee. The Troyans shall To Lauin kingdom come, cast from thy brest that point of feare. But sone repent they shall, and curse the time that brought them there. Repent right sone they shall: was, dredfull wars vprising growes, And Tyber flood I see, with fomy blood how thicke it flowes. Eft sones of Troyan streames nor Greekish camps thou shalt not faile, And in Italia thee a new Achilles shall assail, That borne of goddesse is, nor from the Troyans Iuno stout Shall onewhere absent be, whan thou at neede extreme for dout, What nation of Italia land shalbe? what cities great? That thou that time for ayde with humble sute shalt not entreat? The cause of all this wo, shall be a wife of forayne line, A foraine spouse yet ones againe to Troyans. Yet for these mischiefes all do thou not shrinke, but bolder prease, Where thee thy fortune leades, thy chiefest helth and cause of peace, (Where least thou doost suspect) shall from a Greekish towne apeere. These words did Sibly speake, and rapt with spright in caue oncleere, Her compas croked songes, and doubtfull rimes she belwing soundes, Inuoluing trueth in darke, such bridling bittes and rauing boundes Apollo giues his preest, and close to preache he prickes her brest. Truth in darknes.Whan first her pattring mouth and raging lims were left at rest, Aeneas prince began. No trauaile new this is to mee O virgin pure, nor face of labour none vnfelt I see. All this I do conceiue, and in my minde considred late. One thing I shall desire, (for here men say begins the gate Of great infernall king, and darcksome floods by hell that fleete) Giue licence mee to go to seeke and see my father sweete. Uouchsaue to guide my way, and holy doores do open make. Him I from thousands swordes, and burning flames away did take, These shoulders, eu? these shoulders, through y? foes did bring him out, He passage toke with mee, with mee all streames and londs about, And threatnings all of seas and tempestes all with wery payne, Aboue his age and strength, onweldy man, he did sustaine. And now that I this time before thy dore so meekely pray: Hee mee commaunded thus. Haue pitie now of both vs tway O sacred virgin pure (for thou maist all) nor here in vaine Diana thee hath set, on Lymbo woods to rule and raine. If Orpheus obtained ones his wife from vnder ground, By singing sweete at harpe, and striking stringes of pleasant sound: If Pollux did his brothers death redeeme with his exchaunge, And went and came so oft, what should I talke of Theseus straunge? Or strongest Hercules? my selfe from hie Ioue do discend. These things he talked thus, and fast he held the altars end. Than prophet Sibly said. O borne of blood of heauenly kinde, An easie way to hell.Thou Troian duke, the way that leades to hell is light to finde, Both nightes and daies, the dore of Limbo blacke doth open gape. But backward vp to clime, and free to skies eftsones to skape, There worke, there labour is: few men whom equall Ioue did loue, Or vertue percing all, did to the stars aduaunce aboue, Could worke so great a worke: that midwaies all are compast wide For he must neuertheles afterward.With desertes darke of woods, and slimy flood full blacke doth slide. But if so great desier, such feruent loue thou hast in minde, Two times to loke on hell, two times to swim those lakes onkinde, If pleasour ought there bee, this frantike toyle to lake on thee: She apointes him first so y? gold? tree, wher by is signified wisedome y? ouerc?meth all things.These things first must thou doo. In shadowes great there lurks a tree, With golden crops &amp; bows, with leaues &amp; braunches smooth of golde: Which to Diana deepe, infernall Queene, is sacred holde. This tree hath euery wood, and darke in vales doth hide with shade. But no man breathing life can vnder ground haue power to trade, Till from those goldilocks of bows he brings one braunch deuine, Which to her selfe for chiefe reward Diana doth assigne. Whan one bough broken is, another springs as fresh in sight Of gold, and twigs are euer like, with buds of metall bright. Seeke out therfore with speede, and whan thou duely hast it spied, Lay thou theron thy hand, for willingly with ease, onwried It selfe it shall release, if destnies thee therto do call: For otherwise not breake it will, for strength, nor wepons all. Moreouer, now thy freend deceassid lieth with corps on ground, Alas vnware thou art, and all thy fleete he doth confound, While here thou harkning standst, &amp; councels great of God doost craue. Him first go bring to earth, and giue to him his worthy graue. And slaughters blacke of beastes for sinnes redemption see thou lead. So maist thou Limbo woods, where breathing man may neuer tread, Behold at last (quoth she.) With that, her mouth she stopping staied. Aeneas mourning went, with fixed eyes on ground dismaied. And leauing thus the caue, these fortunes hard and chaunces blinde He found his trompetour Misenus dead on the lande He pondring did reuolue, so did with him Achates kinde, And ioyntly step by step with equall cares they walking went. Much talke between them twaine of sondry things they speaking spent, What frend dame Sibly means, what corps it is they should entiere. But whan to shore they came, onware on sand approching neere, Misenus slaine they see with giltles death, their frend full deere. Misenus trompet sounder chiefe, whose nobler neuer was, In kindling men with noise, and fighting fieldes to chere with bras. Somtime sir mighty Hectors mate he was, to Hector strong With trompet bold and speare he corage gaue in battaill throng, But whan that him from life Achilles victor spoiled had, Unto Aeneas Troian prince this valiant captaine sad Did place him selfe as peere, and nothing worse his chaunce he drew. But than (as mischiefe was) while brasen trompe he swimming blew Triton a fish with a trompet did drowne Misenus in the sea for spirit. For pride, and callinge to compare the Gods of seas did greue: Him Triton toke for spite (if men may boldly this beleue) And dragd him through the rockes, &amp; deepe in seas his enmy drownd. The Troians than with noise his body dead encompast round, And good Aeneas chiefe, than to acomplish Siblyes charge, No longer time they take, but weeping fast an altar large They lade with timber logs, and hie to heauen a pile they bilde. Into a forest old they gon, and hauntes of beastes vnmilde, Down tombling crake the trees, vpriseth sound of axes strokes, Both holmes, and beches broad, and beames of ashe, and shides of Okes, With wedges great they clyue, and mountain elmes with leauers roll. Aeneas eke their worke with corage kindling did controll, And tooles in hand he tooke, and formost man amongst then wrought. Yet heauines in hart he bare, and often thus he thought, If now this golden braunche will through this forest thicke apeere, Than verily right true it is (as all things els ben cleere) And too too true (alas) of thee she spake Misenus deere. Skant spoken were these words, wh? culuers twain by cha?ce in sight, Came ouerhead in skies before his face, and downe they light, And softly sat on ground, he knew forthwith his mothers burdes Doues are Venus birds for their encrease. Aeneas mighty prince, and thus he praied in silent wurdes. O, be my gides (if any way there be) and through these glades Direct mee to the place where fertill soile in darcksome shades Doth beare this golden braunche, and thou O mother great, I pray Now faile me not at neede. Thus speking still himselfe did stay, Beholding brim those byrdes, and how they rise, and where they flie. They feeding there a while amounted forth, and went in skie, Mysteltew callid of some mistelden growing on trees in winter w? a yelow slimy bery cl?my like byrd lyme, it commeth by donging of birds on the trees. The funerals of Misenus maruelously expressed of Virgill. Warme water &amp; cryinges, for many seeme ded &amp; be yet a liue.So far as eyes of man could them pursue, or marke could make. Than whan against Auerna mouth they came, (that stinking lake) They lyft them selues aloft, and through the tender aier they slyde, And falling down at last, they toke their tree, and there did bide, Where glistring braunches shewes of sondry glossid shining gold. None otherwise, than misteltewe on woods in winter cold Renewes his bushes greene, whom tronck of tree did neuer breede, But saffronfrutid bows the stubs therof doth ouerspreede: So from the tree the golden braunch did shew, such was the kinde, So wauering soft it wagde, and tincling sweete it made in winde. Aeneas at it straight, and caught a crop with much ado, And glad with comfort great, dame Siblyes house he brought it to. Nor nothing lesse this while, the Troyans all in solempne gise Did wayle Misenus corps, and gaue to him their last outcries. First, cut in culpons great, and fat of sap with pitche among A stately pile they bilde, with timber trees and Cipers strong. (That dead mens treasour is) his gorgeous armes also they set, Some brought the water warme, and caudrons boyling out they set. The body cold they wash, and precious ointments on they powre. Lamenting loude is made, than close his limmes in bed on floore They couch with weeping teares, &amp; purple weedes on him they throw: His robes, his harneis bright, and ensignes all that men may know. In mourning sort, some heaue on shoulders hie the mighty beere, (A dolefull seruice sad) as children do their father deere, Behinde them holding bronds, than flame vprising, broad doth spreede, And oyles and deinties cast, and frankinsens the fier doth feede. Whan falne his cinders were, and longer blaze did not endure, His reliques and remaine of dust with wines they washed pure. Than Choriney his bones in brasen coffin bright did close, And sprincling water pure, about his mates three times he goes, And drops of sacred dewe with Oliue palmes on them did shake, Nouissima verba. And compas blest them all, and sentence last he sadly spake. To fieldes of ioye thy soule, and endles rest we do betake. But good Aeneas than, right huge in height his tombe did rere, And gaue the lord his armes, his Ore and Trompet fixed there. On mountaine nere the skies, that of Misenus beares the name, And euerlasting shall from world to world retaine the same. This done, dame Siblyes further minde to execute he shapes. Discription of a place in Italy called Auerna, where antiquity supposed to be the entry into hel and is yet a terrible place to loke on. A dongeon darke there is, that euermore wide open gapes, Full rough of rocky stones, and lothsome lake there flowes about. Therouer dare no byrd attempt to flie, for deadly dout, Such prison breath outbreaks, &amp; through the throte with stifling stink, Such smolthring vapour smokes, and vp to skies is born from brinke, Wherby the Greekes by name Auerna mouth that place do call. There hefers chosen foure, full blacke of backes, he first of all Did bring, and wines betweene their fronts the priest of custom threw, And with her hand she pluckt the hear betweene their hornes y? grew, Lo cast in sacred fier, redemption chiefe of deedes amis. And on Diana calles, in heauen and hell that mighty is. Some other sturs with kniues, &amp; blood lukewarme in bolles they take. Him selfe a lambe by darke, vnto the dame of furies blake, And to her sister great with sword he strake, and vnto thee, (O Proserpine) a frutelesse cowe he kilde full blacke to see. Than vnto Lymbo king his altars large he made by night, And bowels whole of Bulles in burning fier enflamed bright. Sibly brought Aeneas into Auerna mouth, &amp; so vnder ground to Lymbo wherin Virgil expresseth all the beliefe &amp; opini? of y? Pagans.And plenty fat of oyles, till offrings all were wasted quight. Behold, before that light of sonne did rise in skies aboue, The ground with roaring shooke, and vnder feete did trembling moue, And tops of trees do turne, and dogs in shade did seeme to houle, Whan first the goddesse came. Auaunt, auaunt, you sinners foule Dame Sibly loud did crie, from all these woods stand out beneath. Kepe thou thy way by force, and naked sword pul from thy sheath, Now time of corage is, now fixe thy minde Aeneas fast. And with that word into Auerna mouth her selfe the cast. He void of feare doth stalking her pursew at elbow fast. O gods that empier keepes on ghostes, and soules of silence dum, Thou Chaos, and you firy boyling pits and places glum, Giue license mee to tell your secret workings vnder ground, Giue pardon to disclose thinges deepe in mist, aud darkenes dround. They walking went in night, alone, in silence through the shade, By Lymbos kingdoms wast, and houses empty voide of trade. Like as the feeble Moone doth giue sometime a fainting light To men y? walke in woods, whan clouds do kepe the skies fr? sight, And all things altred ben, and coulours cleere are hid by night. Euen at the porche, and first in Lymbo iawes, done Wailings dwell, And Cares on couches lyen, and Settled Mindes on vengeance fell. Diseases leane, and pale, and combrous Age of dompish yeeres, And Feare, and filthy Neede, and Hunger hard that mischiefe steeres, Misshapen things in sight. Than Death himselfe, whose neighbor next Was Slepe that kinsman is to Death, than proud Mindes vnperplext Reioysing vile in sin, and mortall Warres afront the gate, And Furies sight in beds of steele, and Discorde far from state With bleeding brows, and vgsome starling heares of angry snakes. Amids them all an Elme with armes out spreding, shadow makes, An Elme both huge and olde, that seat, men say do Fansies keepe, And Dreames vncertaine dwell, and euery leafe they vndercreepe. And diuers monsters more there was, of sondry sortes vnkinde, As Scyllas and Centaurus, man before, and beast behinde, In euery doore they stampe, and Lyons sad with gnashing sound. And Bugges with hundred heads as Briarey, and armed round Chimera fightes with flames, and gastly Gorgon grim to see, With heardes of Harpies vile, and Goblines foule of figures three. Aeneas sodenly for feare his glistring sword out tooke, And as they threatning came, he towards them his fauchon shooke. And (but his learned gyde instruct him did, to let go by Those flittring tender formes, and not to touch those shappes that flye Which nothing ben but life, and substance none, but likenes thin) He would with them haue fought, and did in vaine to beat begin. Here now the way doth lead to Lymbo lake and filthy flud, Whose chanell chokid is with troublous grounds of miry mud, And belching boyles a sand, which to the bancks it throws from deepes. A dreedfull feryman that streame with visage lothsome keepes, In tattrid wretched weede, and Caron he by name doth hight. His hoary bush and beard both ouergrown and foule vndight, With skouling steaming eyes, and from his shoulders down his loines Caron the fery man of hell fluddes. His filthy mantell hanges, whom sluttish knot vncomly ioynes. Himselfe with pyked poale his boate doth guide, and beares a charge, Transporting still the soules, in rusty dusty cankred barge, Well aged now, but sappy strength hee keepes of greener yeres. To this place all the rout doth draw themselues with louring cheres, By numbers great, both men and women dead, nor long delayed. With princes, preaced boyes and girles, that wedlocks neuer sayed, And flouring youth, that in their parentes time were layd in ground, And all that life had borne, about the banke they clustred round, As thicke as leaues of trees among the woods in winter winde Whan first to ground they fall: or like as foules of waterkinde Assembling flocke them selues, whan yere of frost hath first begonne, And ouer seas they seeke in warmer londs to take the sonne. They stood, and crauing cried, that first transport they might before, And stretching held their hands desiring much the further shore. The churlish feryman, now these now those by course receiues, And some down thrusting throws, &amp; from the sand restraining weiues. Aeneas than, for of this great tumult he merueld sore, O virgin tell (quoth hee) what meanes this busie great vprore? What seeke they thus? why to this water bancke ron they so fast? Wherfore be these reiect? and yonder those their course haue past? And some with Ores I see are sweeping yet this chanell blew? Than shortly thus to him dame Sibly spake, that prophet true. O great Anchises son, vndouted child of gods in blisse, Now Lymbo lake thou seest, infernall poole this water is. Cocitus cald it is, and Stigies moore the name doth beare, By which the gods them selues so sore affraid ben to forsweare. This prease that here thou seest, ben people dead that laid in graue, A piteous rable poore, that no reliefe nor comfort haue. This boateman Caron is, and those whom now this water beares, Are bodies put in ground with worship due of weeping teares. Nor from these fearefull bankes nor ryuers hoarce they passage get: Till vnder earth in graues their bodies bones at rest are set. A hundred yeres they walke, &amp; round about these shores they houe, And than at last full glad, to further pooles they do remoue. Aeneas stopt his foote, and stayed him selfe against that place, Reuoluing much in minde, and pitied sore their wofull case. He saw lamenting there, and lacking graues and worship due, Leucaspis and Orontes, lords of Troyan fleete full true. Whom ioyntly both from Troy, as through the swelling seas they past, The southwind whirling toke, and ship and men did ouercast. Behold, his maister chiefe, and pylot guide, syr Palinure Chafing did vexe him selfe, who late in Sicil seas full sure His course with sailing kept, while stars of heauen he vewd at helme He through the pup was falne, and seas him quite did ouerwhelme, Him scarse he could discerne among the soules with frowning face. Than first he spake. O Palinure, what god with heauy grace Hath spoyled mee of thee? and thee in deepe seas thus hath dround? Declare to mee, for neuer heretofore that fals was found, With this one tale vntrew Apollo mee did feede in vaine, Who said, that safe from seas, Italia land thou shouldst attaine, Lo where a man may trust. Is this his faith so vndefilde? Hee theronto. It is not Phœbus thee that hath begylde O Troian king, nor mee that god in seas did ouerwhelme. For as at sterne I stood, and steering strongly held my helme Wherwith I charged was, and course of ships with sailes did beare, The care of a good guide, or Pilot.I hedlong fell therwith. By all the seas full rough I sweare, Nothing so sore I dred, nor for my selfe so much did care, As lest thy ship dispoild, and of her guide and maister bare: Should by misfortune faile, as waues so great that time did rise. Three weery winter nightes, in combrous seas in waltring wise, With waters borne I was: the fourth day skant at last I spied Italia land, as ouer waues full hie my head I wried. By small and small to landward than I swam, and sure I was, Had not the nation wild destroyed me there vnknown, alas. The cruell m?ner of saluage seacoasters. And as I creeping held with crooked hands the mountaines top, Encombred in my clothes that dabbing downe from me did drop, They slew me there with swords, and thought by mee to gaine a pray. Now still in floods I fleete, and to and fro with windes I stray. That I thee, by the gladsome light of heauen and ioyfull skies Now for thy fathers loue, and for thy son whose lucke doth rise: Unwrap me fr? these wrongs (O pereles prince) &amp; bring me a ground, I pray thee, (for thou maist) in Velin hauens I shall be found. Or thou, if any way there bee, if goddesse mother thine Hath shewd thee how to shift (for not without some power deuine This place I thinke thou seest, nor Lymbo pooles thus canst thou swim) Reatche mee thy hand, and take mee wretche with thee by water brim, That after death at least, in pleasant rest I may remaine. Such things he talking spake, whan Sibly thus replyed againe. Since whan O Palinure, hath all this madnes comen on thee? Wouldst thou the Lymbo poole and dolefull floods vntombed see? Unbidden from this banke doost thou in deede to skape entend? Seeke neuer Gods eternall dome with speech to thinke to bend. Yet take with thee his worde, and comfort thus thy greeuous fall. For they that border next vnto that mount, and cities all, By tokens great from heauen, shall be compeld thy bones to take, And tombe they shall thee byld, and solempne seruice thee shal make, And Palinurus name for euermore the place shall keepe. This spoken, from his heauy hart his cares abating creepe, And sorowes partly shranke, and glad on earth his name he knew. They on their iourney went, and towards now the flood they drew. Whom as the boteman first, with eyes vpcast in comming spied To walke in silent woods, and how to shore their feete they plied: He thus began to chafe, and towards them full loude he cried. What euer thou art, that armed thus vnto our floods doost trace: Tell what thine errand is, and stay thy selfe, and stop thy pace. Here is the seate of soules, the place of sleepe and slumbry night, Nor breathing bodies none this boat may bear by law nor right. Nor Hercules (whom I did last receiue) did mee no good, Nor Theseus, with Pirithous, that passed here this flood, Though borne of Gods they were, &amp; peereles lords of strength &amp; minde, Hee with his mighty hands the mastif hound of hell did binde Before the king at benche, and dragde him trembling out to light, Those other did attempt to steale from hence our empresse bright. Than Sibly prophet preest, with gentle speeche thus did entreat. Here is no treason such, do thou not chase nor further freat, These wepons worke no harme, the porter huge for euermore May barking keepe his caue, and bloodles soules affray from shore. Well may Diana chast her vncles chamber long enioy. Aeneas famous here, the curteis prince, in armes of Troy Unto his father goeth, vnto the soules of Lymbo lowe. If vertue none so great may mooue thy minde this man to know, Behold (quoth he) this braunch, &amp; from her garment out she tooke The golden braunch, than angry wrath his swelling hart forsooke, Nor, more she spake, but wondring at that blessed gift of grace, And fatall rod, that seldome seene had ben within that place, She shouid forth his ship, and on the bancke approching hit. Than other soules, that on the sides in long arayes did sit: He tombling draue them downe, and made a rowine, and in he takes Aeneas mighty prince, the boat in ioyntes for burden crakes, And through that lethrin seames the filthy flood in plenty drinkes. Yet landed safe at last both preest and man, on the vtter brinkes, In miry woas, and slimy mud mischapen foule that stinkes, Cerberus the porter of hell.There Cerberus, infernall hound, with throtes wide open three, Doth bawle with barking noyse, at Lymbo mouth full huge to see. Whose necke whan Sibly saw with startling snakes to swelling fixt: A sop of bread with sleepy seedes, and hony sweete commixt Against his throte she threw, he gaping wide his threefold iawes, All hungry caught that gub, and couching strait with stretching pawes, He bowed his boistous backe, and on the ground himselfe be spred, Encombring all the caue, and groueling lay with slumbry head, Aeneas toke the place, while thus the porter slurging was, And skoope the further shore, where backward home no life can pas. Anon were voyces hard, and piteous cries, and wailings shrill, Of soules of tender babes, and infantes weeping void of skill, That pleasure sweete of life did neuer tast, but from their brest Untimely death them tooke, and fortune grim hath down opprest. Next them be such, as false surmise haue don to death by law, Nor they without their iudge, and for their seates their lots they draw, King Minos moues their boxe, and as a iudge their liues enqueres, And calles enquestes of soules, and all their sinnes in silence heres. Than louring next in place, ben they that fell with wilfull death, And giltles slew them selues, with hasty hands, abhoring breath, And shoke from them their soules, how gladly now in skies againe, Would they full poore estate, and hardnes all of life sustaine? The destnies do resist, and lake vnlouely them detaines, And pooles of Lymbo nine in compas ronning, them restraines. Not far aloofe from thence, disperst abroad on quarters all, The mourning feeldes they see (for so by name men do them call.) There they whom cruell loue consumed hath with fretting moodes, In secret pathes they walke, and hide them selues in Mirtill woodes, Encombred still with cares, nor death it selfe their sorowes slakes. There Phædra, Procris, Eriphyle he seeth that mourning makes For loue, and of her son vnmercifull the woundes doth beare. Euadnee than, and Pasiphee, likewise that martryd were. And Cenæus, a lad somtime that was, but now a wife, Conuerted eft by kinde to former shape of females life. Among all these, Queene Dido late that died of fatall wound, He meeteth with Queene Dido in Hell. In forest wandring went, whom when the Troyan duke had found Approching nere and knew, in shimring shadow darke and thin: Much like, as after chaunging new whan prime doth first begin, Men see, or thinke they see, that doubtfull moone in cloudes aboue: He blubbrid out in teares, and thus did speake for dulcet loue. O wofull Dido deere, the tale to trew (as now doth seeme) Was brought mee of thy losse, and of thy stroke and wound extreeme. I was thy cause of death, alas, now by the starres I sweare, By all the Gods, and if there be remaining yet one where Unfained faith, if trueth on ground or vnder ground may bee, Against my will (O Queene) from thy dominions did I flee. But mee, the threatnings great of gods y? through these glimsing glades Compels to seeke, these hoary moory mufty darksome shades, Hath forced mee to this, nor neuer (Queene) could I beleeue, That my departing thee, so sore at hart could euer greeue. Now stay thy selfe, and from my sight withdraw thee not so fast. Whom sleest thou thus? this vnto thee must be my talking last, Aeneas thus to her, that frowning stood, with skouling eyes, He spake to swage her minde, and teares out gushing still did rise. She turning, fixed fast her face on ground with louring looke, Nor more to him did moue, nor at his tale regard she tooke, Than sturres a standing stone, or mountaine rocke for blast of winde, At last from him she brake, and backe she fled with spitefull minde, To shadows thicke of woods, where ioynt with her, her husband olde Sichæus doth complaine, and equall loue with her doth holde. Aeneas nethelesse, whom this mischaunce full sory shooke, Pursude her, weeping long, and at her parting pitie tooke. From thence their way they sought, &amp; now the borders last they helde, Where worthy lords of armes enhabit thicke in secret felde. There met he with sir Tydeus, and valiaunt noble knight Parthenopee, and pale Adrastus ghost, that wofull spright. There, they that much lamented were on earth, and died in war, The Troian lords, he knew them all in long arayes a far. Thersilochus, and Glaucus deere, he sobbid them to see, And Medon, of Anthenor stout the famous children three. And Polybetes, Ceres priest that was, both strong and bolde, Idæus eke, that horses swift and armours yet doth holde. By flockes about him drew the soules full thicke on euery hand, Nor satisfied they ben with loking ones, but still they stand, And steps with him they ioyne, and glad they be his cause to lerne. But all the Greekish lordes, and Agammenons captayns sterne, Whan first the man they saw in glistring armour through the night: They trembling shoke for feare, some turning toke their wonted flight, As to their ships sometime they ran, some others squeking thin Would lift their voice, but in their iawes begonne, it stacke within, Deiphobus y? maried Hel? after the death of Paris.There Deiphobus, Priams son he saw, all boucherwise Bemanglid foule in face, with body torne in cruell gise, Both body, face, and handes, and temples twaine, and eares dispoilde, With lothly cropped nose, and shamefull woundes eche where defoilde. Skarse him he could discerne, that trembling shrank, and couered wold His filthy wounds, than thus he spake with voice acquainted old. O Deiphobus, mighty most in armes, O Troian blood, What saluage tirant beast hath giuen to thee this plage so wood? Who might so great a powre obtaine on thee? The rumour went How in the night extreme, of Greekish slaughters wery spent Thou headlong threwst thy selfe on mixid heapes of enmies slaine. Than I my selfe to thee, an empty tombe on Rheta plaine Aduaunsing vp did bilde, and thrise thy soule saluted cleere. Thy name &amp; armes that place preserues, but thee (O freend so deere) Could I not see, that in thy contrey ground I might enteere. Than Deiphobus said. Nothing (sweete freend,) can I requier. All dueties done thou hast, nor more my ghost can thee desier. But mee, mine own mischaunce, and Helen strompets mischiefe more Hath plunged thus in paines, these tokens mee she left in store. For whan that latter night with ioyes deceitfull vs did feede, Thou knowst: and ouermuch therof to thinke we must of neede. Whan first that fatall horse our contrey walles did ouerskip With armour freyghted full, and harneist footemen downe did slip: Dissembling than to daunse with songes, and himpnes in streets about She drew the Troyan wiues, and in her hand amids the rout She bare the burning torche, and from the towres the Greekes did lure. Than ouercome with cares, I wofull miser sleeping sure Within my chamber was, in pleasant ease, and laid at rest, And slomber sweete and deepe, most like to death had mee opprest. My goodly spouse this while, my wepons all way she cloind, From all my house, and from my head my trusty sword purloind. And Menelae her former husband cald, and fild the floores With clusters great of Greekes, and open wide she set the doores, And mee to them she gaue, for token chiefe of former loue, That same of olde offence by that amendes she might remoue. What should I longer make: into my chamber all they thrust, With false Vlisses helpe. O gods redub them vengeaunce iust, If due rewards I seeke it, Greekes with mee vniustly wrought. But thee, aliue, what wondrous fortune here this time hath brought? Declare to mee, by wandring wide at seas art comen astray? Or gods appointment great, or what mischaunce doth thee dismay, To see this troublous place, these houses heauy voide of sonne? With talking thus, the Morning golden bright had ouerronne The compas halfe of heauen, and mids of skies she now did clime, And haply speaking more, they should haue spent their pointed time, But Sibly warning gaue. The night approcheth fast, we weepe away the time in vaine. Here is the place where now the way deuides it selfs in twaine. The righthand path goth vnderneth the walles of Pluto deepe. That way we must, if path to Paradise we thinke to keepe. The lefthand leades to paine, and damned sinners sends to hell. Than Deiphobus said. O prophet pure that doost excell, Do thou no further freat, I will depart to yonder feeld To fill the number there, and mee againe to darkenes yeeld. Go worship, go thou glory great of Troy, with heauenly grace, God send thee more good lucke, and with that word he turnd his pace. Aeneas turnd his eyes, and in the rocke on lefthand side A castle broad he seeth, with three thicke walles encompast wide. Whom enuironned with rage of flaming flood that fier out spewes, A dampish firy flood, that sounding stones outbelching stewes. A gate against it stands, full huge of height, with pillers great Of Adamant vncut, whom force of mankinde none can beat, Nor gods themselues of heauen: vpstands to skies a brasen towre, Where sits Tisiphonee with blood read tooles, and visage sowre, That combrous monster feend, both daies &amp; nights the watch she keepes Before that entry grim, with gargell face, and neuer sleepes. From thence wer howlings heard, &amp; wretches wawling tost in paines, And clinching loud of Iron, and gingling noise of dragging chaines. Aeneas sterting stood, and all that bustling harkned to. What vengeance nose is this? O virgin tell, what haue they do, That thus tormented ben? what meanes this bounsing? this outrage? Than Sibly thus began. O Troian duke of wisdome sage, No good man may come neere this cursed house of dampned Hell. But mee, whan in Auerna woods Diana set to dwell, She taught mee than their paines, and through these places all did gide. Radam?tas was a iust kinge &amp; therfore is feined to a king in Hell.This boistous empier keepes sir Radamanthus, king of pride, Correcting men for sinne, and all their falshodes heares and tries, Constraining to confesse what euer thing they did in skies, Differring till their death, as if all paines escaped were. Anon, the giltie soules with ramping force and grisly feare Tisiphonee doth take, and scourging them she swaps with whips, And serpentes grim she shakes, and ouer them she stamping skips, With flockes of swarming feends, and all her sisters out she calles, Infernall hideous hags, and to their turments them she stalles. Than verily with thondring fearfull noise, the sacred hookes Doth opening turne their gates, seest what a gard against vs lookes? What faces? what a watch there stands at euery gate in sight? With fifty garing heads a monstrous dragon stands vpright? Yet sits a worse within. Than, Hell it selfe, that sinkehole steepe Two times as broad descendes, two times as hedlong downright deepe: As heauen vpright is hie, if men therto from thence might peepe. There lie the Titans brood, and of dame Earth the linage olde Downthrown with lightning dints, and in that gulf are tombling rold. There saw I serpentfeeted bastards twaine, of Giaunts sise, That in conflict with heauen, to teare the skies did enterprise, Despising Ioue himfelfe, whom from his throne they would haue thrust. Eke Sulmon there I saw, in cruell wreake of turmentes iust. For he the flames of god, and thondring soundes would counterfeat. He borne with horses foure, and shaking bronds and torches great Through contreys all of Greece, and townes triumphing went about, And honors due to God vsurping tooke of euery rout. A frantik man, that peereles lightning clouds would thinke to skorne, With brasse and ronning steedes, that footed ben with hoofe of horne. But Ioue almighty than, a firy dart on him down flang, His artes could him not helpe, nor cressets fierce wherwith he sprang. But hedlong he to hell in whirling storme was thrown to deepes. There plunged now in paines, he in the botom crawling creepes. Eke Tition the darling deere of Earth which all thing breedes You should haue seene, that furlongs nine of ground w? bodies spreedes. An euerlasting torment of lust vnqu?chable. And huge on him there sits, with crooked beake and croming pawes A gastly Gripe, that euermore his growing guts outdrawes, And tiring teareth forth his euerduring liuer vaines, Nor neuer rest there is, but fresh renewes his endles paines. What should I now rehearse the beastly Centaures rable all? Whom ouer hangs a stone that euermore doth seeme to fall. Their bridebeds faier are spred, and golden carpets shine full bright, And precious princely fare before their face is set in sight. Than comes the foulest feend, and all their deinties ouerbroodes, Forbidding them to touch, and from their hands doth snatch their foods, And beats with burning bronds &amp; th?drings thicke her mouth doth cast. There they that did their brethren most abhor while life did last, Or beat their parents, or their clients cause haue foule betraied, And such as gathered goods vnto themselues and no man paied, Nor almes neuer gaue, wherof there is to great a throng, Or for aduoutry haue ben slaine, or reisid warres in wrong, Or rebells to their prince, or maisters goods would not discerne: Included in that Iaile their paines they bide. Seeke not to lerne. What paines: what world of wo there is: how eche his fortune feeles. Some rolles vnweldy rocks, some hangs on hie displaid on wheeles. Some tombling tyre themselues. There euer sits and euer shall Unhappy Theseus, and Phlegias most of misers all, Among those caytiues darke and loude with voice to them doth rore, Learne iustice now by this, and gods aboue despise no more. One wretch his contrey solde, and prince of strength therto did call, He forged lawes for bribes, and made, and mard, and altred all. Another leapt into his doughters bed, confounding kindes, All ment outragious deedes, and fild their foule outragious mindes. Not if I had a hundred mouthes, a hundred tonges to spend, And voyce as strong as steele, yet could I neuer comprehend Their sondry sinnes &amp; paines, nor of their names shuld make an end. When Sibly to Aeneas thus had sayd. Now make mee speede, Go furth, kepe on thy way, performe those things that thou hast neede. Dispatch we now (quoth she) I spie from hence the chimneis tops Of Ciclops boistous walles, I see their gates their forge, and shops, Where we commaunded be to leaue this gift of golden spraies. She said, and ioyntly both they past through crooking darksome waies, And marching through the mids, vnto the gates approched neere. Aeneas through them rusht, and than him selfe with water cleere Besprinckling, toke the braunche, and at the gate he fixt it fast. Description of ParadiseThese things so done, and all the goddesse gift fulfild at last: Into the gladsome feeldes they come, where arbers sweete and greene, And blessed seates of soules, and pleasant woods and groues are seene. A fresher feeld of aier whom larger light doth ouerstrow, And purer breath, their priuat sonne, their priuat stars they know. Some to disport them selues there sondry maistries tried on grasse. And some their gambolds plaid, and some on sand there wrastling was. Some frisking shake their feete, &amp; measures tread &amp; rimes they sowne. And Orpheus among them stands, as priest in trayling gowne, And twancling makes them tune, with notes of musike seuerall seuen, And now with Yuery quill, now strings he strikes with fingers euen. There were the Troyan lords, and antike stocke of noble race, Most prudent princes strong, and borne in yeres of better grace. Both Ilus, and Assaracus, and founder first of Troy, King Dardan, at their armour weedes he wondred much with ioy. Their speares beside them stand, their charets strong are set on ground, Their comly coursing steedes along the launds do feede vnbound. Whan minds, what loue they had, to deeds of arms wh? life they drew, Or what delite in steedes: the same them dead doth now pursue. Another sort he seeth, with hand in hand where gras doth spring, That feasting feede them selues, and heaue and how for ioy they singe. Among the Laurell woods, and smelling floures of arbers sweete, Where bubbling soft with sound the riuer fresh doth by them fleete. There such as for their contreys loue while liues in them did last In battel suffred wounds, or priestes that godly were and chast, Or prophets pure of life, and worthy things to men did preach: Or to adorne mans mortall life did science goodly teache: Their heads are compas knit with garlond floures right fresh of hewe. To whom than Sibly spake, as round about her fast they drew, Onto Musæus first, for he inclosed is in throng With numbers great of soules, and him they keepe alwaies among, Bresthigh aboue them all, and all to him their heads incline. Declare (quoth she) you blessed soules, and thou priest most diuine. What place Anchises hath? where shal we find him? for his sake We be come here, and passed haue the floods of Limbo lake. Than vnto her the sacred priest with wordes full gentle spake. No man hath certen house, but in these shadowes broad we dwell, In beds of riuer bankes, and medowes new that sweetely smell. But you, if such desire you haue, passe ouer yonder downes, My selfe shall be your gide by easie path into those bownes. He said, and went before them both and fieldes ful bright that shynd He shewd them from aboue, and all the downes they left behind. Anchises prince, that time in pleasant vale surueying was The soules included there that to the world againe should passe. And reckned all his race, and childers childerns line he told, And kest their destnies all, and liues, and lawes, and manhods bold. He whan against him there Aeneas comming first beheld, As he did walke in grasse, his hands to heauen for ioy vp held, With tricling teares on cheekes, &amp; thus his voyce from him did yeld. And art thou comen at last, long looked for, my son so deere? Thy vertue ouercame this passage hard, and now so cleere, Do I behold thy face? with rendring speech to speech of thine? So verily mee thought, and in my minde I did deuine Acompting still the times, nor mee my carcke hath not begilde. What contreys thee (my son) what combrous seas? what nations wilde Turmoyld with daungers all, thee scaped now do I receiue? How sore affraid I was, lest Lybie lands should thee deceiue? He therunto: Thy ghost O father sweet, thy greeuous ghost, Perturbing in my dremes hath me compeld to see this coast. On Tirrhen shore my nauy stands at seas, now let vs ioyne Good father hand in hand, now thee from mee do not purloyne. Thus talked he with teares. Three times about his necke his armes he would haue set, and thries In vaine his likenes fast he helde, for through his hands he flies Like winde, vngropable, or dreames that men most swift espies. Lethee a floud of forgetfulnes.This while Aeneas seeth a croked vale, and secret wood, And shrubs of sounding trees, and fleeting through them Lethee flood, With sleeping sound, that by those pleasant dwellings softly ran: And peoples thicke on euery side that no man number can. As bees in medowes fresh, (whom somer sun doth shining warme) Assembling fall on floures, and Lilies white about they swarme, With huzzing feruent noyse, that euery feeld of murmour ringes. Pagans opinions Aeneas with that sight amasid stood, and of those things The causes all did axe, what flood it is, so dull that glides? And what those peoples ben, that fill so thicke those water sides? Anchises than to him. These soules (quoth he) that bodies new Must yet againe receiue, and limmes eftsones with life endue, Here at this Lethee flood they dwell, and from this water brincke These liquors qu?ching cares, &amp; long forgetful draughts they drink, That of their liues, and former labours past, they neuer thinke. These things to thee, full trew I shall set forth before thine eyes, And shew thee all our stocke, of thee and mee that shall arise, That more thou maist reioyce Italia land to finde at last. O father, is it true? may soules that ones this world hath past And blessed ben in ioy, to bodies dull againe remoue? What meane they so? why wretched wordly light do they so loue? I will declare forsooth, nor long (my son) I will thee holde, Anchises aunswer made, and all in order did vnfolde. First heauen and earth, and of the seas that flittring feeldes &amp; fines, These glorious stars, this glistring globe of moone so bright that shines, One liuely soule there is, that feedes them all with breath of loue, One mind through al these m?bers mixt this mighty masse doth moue. From thence mankinde, &amp; beasts, and liues of foules in aier that flies, And all what marblefaced seas conteines of monstrous fries, One chafing fier among them all there sits, and heauenly springes Within their seedes, if bodies noisom them not backward bringes. But lompe of liueles earth, and mortall members make them dull. This causeth them, of lust, feare, griefe and ioy, to be so full. Nor closed so in darke, can they regard their heauenly kinde, For carcas foule of flesh, and dongeon vile of prison blinde. Moreouer, whan their end of life, and light them doth forsake: Yet can they not their sinnes nor sorowes all (poore soules) of shake. Nor all contagions fleshly, from them voides, but must of neede Much things congendred long, by wondrous meanes at last outspreed. Therfore they plaged ben, and for their former fautes and sinnes Their sondry paines they bide, some hie in ayer doth hang on pinnes. Some fleeting ben in floods, and deepe in gulfes them selues they tier The painims purgatory. Till sinnes away be washt, or clensed cleere with purgin fier. Eche one of vs our penaunce here abides, than sent we bee To Paradise at last, we few these fieldes of ioy do see: Till compas long of time, by perfit course, hath purged quight Our former cloddrid spots, and pure hath left our ghostly spright, And sences pure of soule, and simple sparkes of heauenly light. Than all, whan they a thousand yeres that wheele haue turnd about, To drinke of Lethee flood, by clusters great, God calles them out. That there forgetting all their former liues, and former sin, The mortall world afresh, in bodies new they may begin. Anchises said, and therwithall his sonne and Sibly takes, And drawes them through y? mids of all that prease y? sounding makes, Unto a mount, from whence they may their orders long a rowe, By leysour ouer read, and as they come their faces knowe. Now let vs see what glory great our Troyan line shall spreede, And what redouted lusty lads, Italia land shall breede, Most princely sprites, our noble Troyan fame aduaunce that shall, In briefe I will dispatch, and thee declare thy destnies all. Seest thou not yonder liuely child that leaning bendes his speare? His lot is next to rise, and next in world his head shall reare, Of Troyan and Italian blood commixt, thy worthy childe, Thy Siluius, borne after thy deceasse in forest wilde. Here Virgill taketh a wonderful occasi? to discourse the posteritie of Aeneas, and to set forth the glory and nobilitie of Rome. Whom late at last to thee thy wife Lauinia bearing bringes, A stately king him selfe, and father great of stately kinges. From whom our linage long shal Alba kingdoms riche enioy. Than yonder Procas next, the proud renown of former Troy, And Numitor, and Capis good, and hee that thee by name Shall represent, Aeneas Siluius of noble fame, And deedes of armes with vertue mixt, if euer he may raigne, If euer hee his Alba lands, and kingdoms may obtaine. Which lusty lads behold, from them what corage doth redound, And how their tops with oken bows, and ciuill crownes are bound. They vnto thee Nomentum land, and Gabios townes shall tame, And Fidenas, and cities great and proud they shall reclame. The chiefe crowne of honour among Romaines was of grasse and ok? bow. Romulus the founder of Rome. Pometium, and Innus castles strong, and Bolam bowres, And Collantine, and Coram hilles, suppresse they shall with toures. These names shal than vprise, now nothing is but nameles dust. Than Romulus, that valiant impe of Mars, him forth shal thrust, To match his graunsir great, whan Ilia Queene shall bring to light Of Troyan blood, seest not his dubblecreastid head vpright? And with what grace the king of heau? doth mark his chosen knight? Behold my son the man, for through his lucke and huge deuise, That peereles mighty Rome, that glorious Rome aloft shal rise. Whose rod shall rule the total earth, whose mindes shal match y? heuen, And reyse their wals they shal, including toures, and mountains seuen, Most fortunate in frute of men, as Berecinthia Queene, From whom the race of Gods, and linage all discended beene. She riding through the world, in charet borne with godly grace, Her hundred deerlings sweete her childerns childern doth embrace All heauenly wightes, all scepter bearers bright, in stars on hie. Now this way turne thy face, and on this nation cast thine eie. He puts Augustus next Romulus for dignitie, being many yeres after in time.Behold thy Romains, see where Cæsar is, and of Iule The progeny that vnder poles of heauen shal beare the rule. This man, this is the man, of whom so oft I haue thee tolde, Augustus Emprour, prince deuine, he shall the world of gold Saturnus Golden world (sometime that was) eftsones restore. On Garamants, and Indes, and contreys conquerd more and more His empier out shall stretch. Beyond the starres the kingdoms ronne, Beyond the firmament and signe, from course of yeare and sonne, Where Atlas (mighty mount) on shoulders strong y? heuen doth turne, And vnderprops the pole that beares the stars that euer burne. At this mans comming, lo, euen very now, all Asia quakes For Augustus subdued Aegipt. For drede, and temples great of Gods with aunsweres gresly shakes. And Nilus flood for feare his issues seuen doth foule confound. Nor neuer Hercules him selfe could walke so much of ground, Though hee with dart the windy footed hinde did ouertyer, Though monsters swift hee slew, and dragons quaking brent with fier. Nor Bacchus victor so could nations wild and proud reclame, Though he with bridling bits of vines did ride on Tigers tame. And stand we still in doubt by valiaunt deedes to purchase fame? Here he returneth to Romulus succession. Or for Italia land to fight, should we our destnies blame? But what is yonder hee, that Oliue palme so comly beares? Most like a priest? lo now I know, I know those hoary heares, And whitish bearded chin of prudent Numa, Romain king, That vnto lawes and peace shal first the simple people bring, From poore estate to mighty kingdome cald, whom shal succeede He that his contreys ydlenes shall breake, and force of neede To stur them selues in armes, king Tullus, he shal vp reuiue Their sluggish sprites, and teach to win, and triumphes eft atchiue. Next vnto him, with greater boast, king Ancus them shall guide, That of the peoples praise to much already takes a pride. Wult see the Tarquin kings? and stately soule of Brutus brest? Of Brutus, mischief wreaker? and by him the kings supprest? Brutus slew his sedicious sonnes. He first the Consulship on him shall take, and first of all, His onely sons vnto their death, for welth of Rome shall call, Whan they with battailes new against the Consuls would rebell, Himselfe for freedom fayer, with edge of axe shall do them quell. Unlucky man, how euer latter age shall praise the same, His contreys loue him driues, and greedy lust of endles fame. See Decios, and Drusos, and his axe that doth distraine Torquatus, Lo Camillus, standards lost that brings againe. But yonder matches twaine, whom shine thou seest in harneis bright, Camillus recouerer of ensignes Iulius cæsar, and Pompeius. Now louing soules they bee, while both are wrapt in darke of night. Alas, what wondrous wars? if euer they in life apeere, What bloody fighting feeldes? what slaughters wild shall they vpsteere? The fatherlaw from Alpes hilles, and towres of Fraunce shal fall. The son in law, from Estern lands shal moue with armies all. Not so my lads, not so, such greeuous wars do you not minde, Nor with your hands your contreys wombe to teare be so vnkinde, And chiefly thou, thou from the gods of heauen that doost descend, Cast from thy hand thy wepons, O my blood. He with triumphant ioy, in charet borne, and mighty traine Shall clime the Capitoll of Rome, whan lords of Greekes are slaine, And townes vprooted ben, Corinthus, Argos, great Micene, Pompeius. Quintius.He victor conquer shall, and from the ground subuert them cleane. Another vanquish must Achilles brood, sir Pirrhus wilde, And wreke his graunsirs old of Troy, and Pallas church defilde. Cato.Who can but thinke of thee, most worthy Cato sterne of minde? Cossus.Or noble Cossus thee who can forgetting leaue behinde? Gracchus.Or gracious Gracchus line, or captaines twaine who can withstand Scipios destroied Catthage.Two Scipios? two thonderboltes of war: for Lybie land A deadly fatall plage: or who can thee extoll ynough Fabritius. Fabritius? that much canst do with small, or from thy plough Serranus. Serranus thou that comest? and after conquests sowest thy corne. Where now away withdraw you wery mee? you noble borne Fabius max.You Fabij? thou Maximus, thou onely art the man That all our welth forlorne, by sober lingring reskue can. Some forsing metals fine shal brasen shappes with breath endue, I weene they will to marble stones giue life with likenesse true. Cicero.They causes best shal pleade, and course of heauen in wondrous wise, Firmicus.They shall describe with rod, and teach the state of stars that rise. Remember Romaine thou, to rule thy realmes with empier iust, Good counsell.Let this thy practise bee. To much on peace set not thy lust, Thy subiectes euer spare, and stomacks proud downe vanquish plaine. So lord Anchises said, and (as they wondred) spake againe. Behold, how gorgeous gay with spoyles Marcellus goth vpright, Aboue all men, by shoulders hie he doth surmount them quight. Hee, whan the Romaine state with great commotion troubled is, Marcellus.Shal stay with horsemen stout, &amp; make the Moores their purpose misse, And ouerthrow their throngs, and rebell French in combat kylde, His armour spoyles to Ioue, for offering third he shall vpyelde. Yonge Marcellus, Augustus sisters son, that should haue ben his heir in the empier. Aeneas there, (for walke with him he saw a seemely knight, A goodly springold yong in glistring armour shining bright, But nothing glad in face, his eyes down cast did shew no cheere.) O father, what is he that walkes with him as equall peere? His onely son? or of his stocke some child of noble race? What bustling makes his mates? how great he goth with portly grace? But cloud of louring night his head full heauy wraps about. Than lord Anchises spake, and from his eyes the teares brake out. O son, thy peoples huge lamented losse seeke not to know. The destnies shall this child, vnto the world, no more but show, Nor suffer long to liue. O gods, though Rome you thinke too strong He died in youth, and was buried with sixe hundred hearses. For these xxvi. verses Octauia mother of Marcellus did giue, in reward to Virgill, asmuch as amo?teth to more th? v.M. french crownes, which in English mony is more th? 1075. poundes. And ouermuch to match, for enuie yet do vs no wrong. What wailings loud of men in stretes, in feeldes, what mourning cries In mighty campe of Mars, at this mans death in Rome shall rise? What funeralls? what numbers dead of corpses shalt thou see? O Tyber flood, whan fleeting nere his new tombe thou shalt flee? Nor shall there neuer child, from Troian line that shal proceede, Exalt his graunsirs hope so hie, nor neuer Rome shall breede An impe of maruell more, nor more on man may iustly bost. O vertue, O prescribed faith, O righthand valiaunt most. Durst no man him haue met in armes conflicting, foteman fearce, Or would he fomy horses sides with spurres encountring pearce. O piteous child, if euer thou thy destnies hard maist breake: Marcellus thou shalt bee. Now reatche mee Lillies, Lilly flours, Giue purple Uiolets to mee, this neuews soule of ours With giftes that I may spread, and though my labour be but vaine, Yet do my duety deere I shall. Thus did they long complaine. And compas round the campe they wandring went, and vewd about, In borders broad of ayer, and of the soules surueied the rout. Which whan Anchises thus had shewd his son in order due, And kindled glad his minde with fame of things that should ensue: Than him of all his warres, and great affaires to come, he told, Of king Latines towne, and of his realmes and peoples bold, And how eche labour best may voided bee, or easely borne. Two gates of sleepe there bee, the one men say is made of horne, Wherthrough by passage soft do sprites ascend with sences right. That other gate doth shine, and is compact of Yuery bright, But false deceitful dreames that way the soules are woont to send. With talking thus, whan lord Anchises first had made an end, And counsaile gaue his son, and al his minde had put from dout, He brought them both, and through the Yuery gate he let them out. Caieta in Italy between Cumas and Tyber. He toke his way forthwith, and to his nauy went by land. And finding there his mates, he brought them to Caieta strand. Their ankers fr? their foreships cast, their pups on shore they stand. DEO GRATIAS. Per T. Phaer in foresta Kilgerran 13. Augusti, 1557. Opus triginta dierum. THE SEVENTH BOOKE of the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. Aeneas burieth Caieta his Nurse, and calleth the place Caieta, by her name. From thence he passeth by the seat of Circes, &amp; by prosperous wind is brought to y? mouth of Tiber, &amp; driuen with a contrary streame: he arriueth on y? coast of Laurentum. And vnderstanding there by Ascanius wordes, that the same was the land that was predestinate vnto him: he sendeth vnto king Latinus, y? ruled those quarters, an hundred oratours, which should both carie gifts vnto him in his name, &amp; request a place wherin to build a Citie. King Latinus gently hearing their embassadge, ouer &amp; besides their request voluntarely offreth vnto Aeneas, his daughter Lauinia to wife, whom by the prophecy of his father Faunus, &amp; the answere of the southsayers: he was commaunded to bestow vpon a straunger. This while Iuno displeased with the prosperous successe of the Troians: calleth Alecto out of Hell to disturbe this peace. Who first enrageth with her fury Amata, king Latinus wife, &amp; Turnus also. Then, turning her self to the Troian youth, which then haply was busied in hunting: bringeth vnto their hands a tame stag which was dearely beloued among Tyrrheus the kings heardmans children. Whom when Ascanius had wounded with an arowe, the husbandmen betaking th?selues to weapon, set vp? the Troians. Alecto from an hie place giueth thalarme, in which tumult are slaine Almon, Tyrrheus eldest sonne, &amp; Galesus the ritchest husbandman in all that countrey. Who when they were brought dead vnto the citie, Turnus &amp; Amata do prick forth king Latinus to make war, and to reuenge this iniurie. But he calling to remembrance the destnies, and the league which he made of late with the Troians: could not be perswaded to make war against them. Then Iuno her selfe openeth the gates of war. Mezentius with Lausus his sonne do accompany Turnus into battell. Likewise Auentinus son to Hercules by Rhea. Also Catillus &amp; Coras Tyburtine brothers, and Camilla of the realme of Volica, a most valyant woman, and diuers other, whose names are recited in the end of the booke. He burieth his nurse Caieta and giueth hir name to y? coast. And thou Caieta, Aeneas nurse, deceassing on our shore, Hast therby giuen therto a lasting fame for euermore. Thy bones, and name, thine honor there preserues, and setled bee. In great Italia land, if that may worship do to thee, But good Aeneas, whan her obyt rightes were ended all, And tombe vpreisid round, as soone as hie seas downe did fall, He toke his way with sayles, and from the port departed quight: The wind with pipling blows, nor moone doth lack to giue th? light, He sayleth al?g the coast of Circes a famous ench?tres or witche th? dwelling in Italy, which turned men into beasts. The trembling water shines with beames reflected glistring bright. Along dame Circes coast adioynant next, their course they cut, Where Circes Phœbus doughter proud her welthy seats hath put, In sounding saluage woods, and sauours sweete by night she burns, And precious weauing webs, with clattring tooles she works &amp; turns. From thence were wailings heard, and lions wrathfull loud did grone, Resisting in their bands, and nere to night they make their mone, Both bristled groining bores, and beares at mangers yelling yawle, And figures foule of wolues they heare for wo to fret and wawle, Whom from the shappes of men, to brutish beasts, and faces wild Dame Circes did transforme, with herbes of might, &amp; charmes vnmild. Which sore mischaunce, lest simple Troyans poore should feele the lyke, Or in those hauens ariue, or on that parlous coast should stryke: Neptunus fild their sayles with prosprous winde, and gaue them way To flee that cursed shore, and from that daunger did conuey. And now the sea with sonne beames waxed read, and hie from skies The golden morning bright with roset wheeles did mounting ryse, Here he espieth y? ryuer of Tiber in Italy. Whan euery winde was laid, and sodenly no breath did blowe, And they their ships in marble seas with Ores did wrastling towe. And there Aeneas from the seas beheld a hugy wood, Where fleeting swift with whirling streames most pleasant Tyber flood Breakes out it selfe in seas, with sandy waters troblous read, Where sondry sortes of foules, on euery side, and ouer head, Their wonted chanell keepe, and banks, whose cheerefull noises shrill Reioyced sweete the skies, and in the groue they flew at will. Their forships all to landward than to turne, and inward bend They enter Tiber. He bids his mates, and to the deepe flood glad he doth descend. Now muse, now let vs see, what gouernment, what state of thinges, In Italy that time there was, what captaines great, what kings, In y? first six bokes he described y? trauailes of Aeneas now in other sixe he declareth of his wars perfourming his promise of armes and of the man I singe. Whan first this straungers fleete in Latium land did ships ariue I will setfurth, and causes first of fight I shall descriue. Thou goddesse giue mee might, of gastly warres now must I sing, Of mortall battailes fought and slaine with armies king by king, Uprores of angry realmes, and all Italia mixt with blowes I must report, a greater course of things to mee there growes, A greater worke I steere, King Latin than that contrey helde, Well aged now, and cities long in welthy peas did welde. This man was Faunus son, Marica goddesse was his dame, King Picus, Faunus father was, and he doth fetch his name From thee O Saturne great, thou art his syre and first of blood. No son to him there was, none issue Male (so fortune stood) For in his springing youth withdrawen he was, and life did yeelde. One doughter did remaine, and all that house susteining helde, Now husbandrips, now wedlockable full, of lawfull yeeres. From large Italia land, full many a lord, and princely peeres Full glad for her did sue, but ouer all, of beauty most, King Turnus lusty prince (of kingly stock that best might bost) Aboue them all was chiefe, and him the Queene did see most meete, And wondrously did hast, to ioyne with him her doughter sweete. Laurent? y? citie of king Latinus.But monsters great fr? gods, &amp; heuenly threatnings makes her drede. A Laurell tree there was, amids the court, that hie did sprede, With sacred crops and bowes, and many a yere in reuerence had: Which whan king Latin first that tower did builde, by destny glad He found, and vnto Phœbus great did consecrate the same, And of that Laurell tree, did Laurent call that cities name. A wondrous thing to speake, this Laurell bush full thick of browse, From skies descending down, a swarme of bees beset the bowes, Incessant thicke with noise, and fast with feete in cluster clung, All sodenly did close, and on the top with heft they hung. Anon the prophet cried. An alien captaine, O (quoth hee) And alien army comes, and gets possession here I see. And parties clustring cleaue, &amp; gathring strength the tower they take. Lauinia king Latinus doughter.Besides all this, whan she her selfe to gods did offring make Lauinia virgin pure, and stood at the altars next her Syer, A wondrous sight was seene, that all her hear had cought a fier, And crakling flame outspred, and all her garmentes brent at ones. Her robes, her virgin lockes, her crown beset with precious stones, Which sodenly did stint, than blustring smoke, and blasing light With violence vpflew, and to the roofe it ran vpright. This dreedfull signe, and on this wondrous sight men marueld much. For like to her in fame all prophets sang, should be none such. But causes great of war, betokened were by her to grow. But Latine king, that on these monsters all did muse and carck, His father Faunus minde and sentence sooth he went to harck, That time spirits gaue aunswers in woods. To darke Albumea wood, which on the mountaine growes full great, Where sacred flood doth sound, and fountaines falling downe do sweat. From thence the contreys nere, and through Italia nations all Do fetche their councell chiefe, and in their doubtes for answers call. The preest his offring makes, and killes the sheepe at dead midnight, And laieth his limmes at rest, and soundly sleepes on fleeses white. There visions straung he seeth, and many a sprite ful thin that flits, And sondry voyces heeres, and with the gods in taske he knits, In heauen, in Lymbo pooles, and soules hee seeth in hell that sits. There: whan king Latin first deuoutly prayed for answer full, A hundred chosen sheepe he down did kill that bare their wull, And spred their backs on ground, and resting slept vpon their skins, With meeke desier: than through that groue a loud voice thus begins. Seeke not to set thy doughter deere with none of Latin land, O worthy son, nor trust this wedlocke now thou hast in hand. A son in law from contreys far there comes, whose stately race Unto the stars our name shall lift, whose issue great of grace, All things within this world, where euer sonne doth round recule, On both sides londs and seas, shall vnder feete down tread, and rule. These warnings of his father Faunus giuen at dead midnight, King Latin did not hide, but Fame the cities filde forth right, Of all Italia realmes, whan to the shore this Troyan fleete In landing toke their bancke, and fastned ships with cables meete. Aeneas with his captaines chiefe, Ascanius faier to see, On greene grasse toke their ease, and vnderneth a seemely tree Their deintes forth they drew, and meate they set on cakes of meale, Refreshing sweete their mindes, so Ioue him selfe did please to deale. And mountaine frutes they toke, and heapes of apples hie they pight. Whan all things els were spent, &amp; they by chaunce were driuen to bite Their crusts of cracknell cakes, and eat for skantnes vp their croms, And hungry brake with hands their leauings last, and set their goms Upon their fatall bread, nor trenchers broad they did not spare: Here the prophecie of y? harp: was fulfild, mencioned in the third booke y? they shuld be driuen to eate their tables. How now sirs? haue we eat our tables vp for want of fare? The childe Ascanius said. Nor more to this did hee allude. That voyce receiued strait, all feare from them did first exclude, And end of labours brought, and from his mouth as hee it saide His father toke that word, and with deuotion great he staide. Than kneeling, thus. Alhayle O contrey mine by destnie due, And you all hayle (quoth he) O Troian goods of promise true. Here is my dwelling house, my resting lond: my father old (Now comes it in my minde) these secrets mee full often told, Whan thou (my son) thy ships on coast vnknowne doost first ariue, And hunger hard for lacke to eate thy tables thee shal driue, There maist thou trust thy resting place to byld, and safly there Foundations make of walles, and houses hie be bold to rere. This was that hunger sore, this is our last of labours all, All sorowes now shall cease. Wherfore come of, and in the morning next at light of sonne, What people dwels hereby, what towns they kepe, &amp; where they won, Let vs enquire and loke, and from the hauen withdraw we all. Now skinke your cups to Ioue, and great Anchises cheerely call, And pray to gods for helpe, and fetch forth wines in plenty round. This spoken, hee with garlond bowes his temples freshly bound, And praied his gods of peace, and worship gaue vnto dame Ground, (That formost is of gods) and aungell good that keepes that place, And Nimphes, &amp; fairie Queenes, &amp; fluds vnknown hee sought of grace. Than gods of night he calde, and signes of stars by night that rise. A token from heauen to Troians.And chiefly Ioue, and both his parents strong in hell and skies. The almighty father than, three times arowe from heauens on hight, Did signe of thondring showe, and golden beames with burninge light Was seene, and with his hand himselfe in cleare skie shooke the cloude, Anon the rumour spred, and through the campe was blasyd loude, That now the daye was come, that houses hie they should possesse. Their bankets they restore, and man to man their ioyes expresse. And wines in bolles they set, and cups they crowne, and feasts renew. The morning next, whan torche of burninge sonne the world did vew, And day dispersyd was, on euery side they seeke, and send Surueyours through the coast, and tops of mountaines next ascend. A citie chiefe they finde, of Numik lake, here springs the Well. This Riuer Tyber is, here Latin peoples strong do dwell. Than lorde Anchises son, from all his bands a hundred knightes Embassadours did choose, and to the king on message dightes. Their crownes in compas knit with bows of peace, and myld attyre, To beare the king his giftes, and leage to Troyans to desyre. They forth without delay, with speedy feete did plie their pace, Whiles he describing drew to bilde his walls a comly place, In fashion like a campe, with trenche and bulwarkes strong and hie. And now the knights their iourney nere had past, and toures they spie, Of king Latinus towne, and lofty castels large appeere, And orderly they set them selues, and walles approched neere. Before the towne the liuely youth, and children fresh of lust On horses tried them selues, and coursers wilde vpturnd in dust. Or whirling drue their darts, or launces long with str?gth they shake. And some their bowes did bend, &amp; some for wrastling matches make. A riding post forthwith vnto the king doth tidinges beare, How forein knights vnknown, in garments strange approching were. He bids men them receiue, and to his court to bring and call. Himselfe to counsell went, and in the mids he sat in hall. A Hall of huge estate, with pillers hie a hundred borne, The description of king Latinus hall. Aboue the towne there stoode, king Picus court in time beforne, Beset with sacred woods, where olde religion dredfull dwels. There wonted were the kinges to take their crownes &amp; no where els. And there their scepters stoode, this was both minster, court, and hall, Here stood their offring pewes, and many a slaughter down did fall. And Lordes at tables round in solempne dayes did feast and dine. There was besides all this, full many an image olde and fine Of antike Cedar wrought, and row by row his graunsirs tall Both Italus and Sabin kings, and he that first of all Did plant Italia vynes, Saturnus olde, with crooked hooke In hand, and doublefaced Ianus slie did backeward looke, At entry first they stood, and other kings of olde discent, That for their contreys loue, in battayle fight their blood had spent. And ouer this, there hangs much enmies harneis fixt on height, And spoyles, and captiue chares, and halberd axes, huge of weight, And helmet crestes, and brasen bolting bars of conquerd townes, With speares, &amp; battred sheelds, and tops of ships, &amp; garland crownes. Himselfe in kingly throne, with cutted coape, most like a God In heauenly armour sat, and held in hand his bagle rod. A bagle staf wh? prelats y? time did vse in their religion, and was called Lituus King Picus, king, and tamer proud of steedes, whom caught with loue Dame Circes deere his spouse from shape of mankinde did remoue. She chaunged him by charme, and smit his head with golden spray, And poysoned drinking draughts, and him of man she made a Iay, And to the woods he flew, with speckled wings of colours gay. In such a temple, and so costly seat, and comly wrought, King Latine sat, and bad before him Troians should be brought. Whan they were in, with gentle speech him selfe did thus begin. Tell on you Troyan knights, for of your name, nor towne, nor kin We neede not aske, nor vnbeknown to vs your ships ariue, King Latinus to y? Troians.What seeke you here? what cause or neede of things do you thus driue To touche Italia land? so many a port as you haue past? With wandring from your way? or by some storme haue ye ben cast? As like mischaunces oft, in depth of seas do shipmen byde. How entred you this hauen? and in our rode so saufly ride? Refuse not our reliefe, nor let it be to you vnknowne, How wee of Saturns stocke, that quietly possesse our owne, Do iustice truly deale, not bound by leage, nor by no lawes, But vncompeld, our gods example old our freewils drawes. And now I call to minde (the fame by yeres is made obscure) Of aged mens report, and mencion yet therof doth dure, How from this nation first king Dardan sprang, and from these bowns Departed first, and perced Asia land, and Troyan townes, And Samos yle, that Samothracia yet by name is calde. Now hie in heauen he sits, and on the golden stars is stalde, In pallais bright of skies, and power of gods he doth encrease. Oration of Illioneus to king Latin most artificiall.He said, and Ilioneus thus began as he did cease. Most noble king, O Faunus worthy blood, by neither blast Of storme, nor winter winde, we to your contrey shore be cast. Nor stars haue vs begilde, nor we our way mistaken haue. Of purpose here we come, and with good will did alway craue To reatche this coast. Expulsed out from realmes, that none so stout The sun did euer see, that all the round world whirles about. From Ioue our linage leades, the youth of Troy from Ioue on hie Reioyseth to descend, our king in blood to Ioue is nie, Aeneas Troian prince, from him we seeke your sacred tower. What plage, what tempest wood, fr? cruell Greece did late down power On Troian feeldes and townes, and how the world on mischiefe set, Both Asia and Europe sides in fatall conflictes iustling met, Well knowen it is: and hee that furthest dwelles in furthest yles Hath heard therof (and if there be) whom scorching flame exiles, Disseuered out from men by strength extreme of stragling sun, In mids the circles foure, as far for heat as man may run, From that deluge, through many a desert seas we turnd and tost: Beseeke your grace of rest, and for our gods a harmeles cost, Of water, winde, and ayer, that open is to all mankinde. No losse to your estate, nor vs vnthankfull shal you finde, Nor small your fame shalbe, nor neuer we will you deceiue, Shall neuer Latins greeue, the Troyans poore they did receiue. By king Aeneas fortune great I sweare, and valiaunt might Of his right hand, who list with him to trie in faith or fight: Full many a nation strong (despise vs not that here we stand As suters poorely sent, with wordes of peace and palmes in hand) Haue sued likewise for vs, and faine with vs would haue compound. But we commaunded come, and by predestin seeke this ground, By tokens straunge from heauen. King Dardan hence that did descend, Now claimes his right, and gods enforcing vs doth homeward send To Tyber flood, and to the sacred fourdes of Numikes Well, Our wandring gods to place, and peasably with you to dwell. He giues you here also, these tokens small of fortune left, Remaines of former welth, from burning Troy by force bireft. This offring bolle of golde Anchises great was wont to lift, This royall pall king Priams garment shewes, this stately gift, His kingly scepter was, whan lawes in peace he did pronounce, Or nations subiect cald, or leagues of princes would renounce. Lo here also, embroidred sacred robes, and crownes attire, And clothes, the Troyan ladies worke. At this oration of sir Ilionee, the king Latine With fixed countnance stood, and round about him kest his eyen, Considring much in minde, nor him the pall nor purple weede Doth moue so much, nor to king Priams scepter giues such heede, As on his doughters fortune thinkes, he therin wholy staies, And in his brest his father Faunus answers deepely wayes. How this the straunger is, whom gods appointment did prouide To match his doughter to, and him his realmes to helpe to guide. Of whom there should (as lately bruted was by prophets true, An issue spring, that all the world with vertue should subdue. At last hee cheerely said. God worke our meanings to the best, And send encrease of grace. Thou shalt haue Troyan thy request. Your gifts I not reiect, and while king Latin hath his health Abundant soyle shal you not lacke, nor wish for Troian wealth. Now let your kinge him selfe (if such desire he beares in minde, If freendship such he seekes, and if he list this leage to binde,) Prophecies had setled his minde before the comming of Aeneas.Approche our presence to, let him not feare his freend to see. His right hand once to touche, shal pledge of peace remaine to mee. Depart your way and to your king do you my wordes declare: A doughter I haue, whom ioyne to neighbour none I skarcely dare For tokens downe from heauen, for wonders daily thicke that rise. The destnies do forbid, and prophets bookes pronounce likewise, That for the peoples welth a straunger borne should haue that chaunce, Whose famous blood should to the stars of heauen our name aduaunce. Perhaps him fortune calles, and if in minde I rightly gesse: This man is hee, and if gods will so bee, I would no lesse. These things he spake, and horses straight from stables forth he calles, Three hundred fresh there stoode, at mangers hie bestowd in stalles. For euery Troyan knight, a palfray braue he bids out bring, In crimsin couered all, and of their feete as swift as wing. Their brestes embroidred gilt, their poitrels pendant compas folde, All gilded glistring bright, and vnder teeth they gnaw their golde. A charet for Aeneas eke, with coursers like in tire, Of heauenly seede, and from their nosethrils fierce outbreathing fier. Circes inuented to ioyne celestial horses to mortall Mares, wherof came a diuine race of steedes.Engendred of that race, whom Circes liuely did inuent To mixe with mortall steedes, and stale the stormes for that intent. With such rewards, and with king Latins words, the knights of Troy On horses hie returne, and peace they bring with feastfull ioy. Behold, from Græcia land dame Iuno Queene did than remoue, (The testy spouse of Ioue) and hie on cloudes she stoode aboue Beholding all these things, and from the Cape of Sicil strond She vewd the Troian fleete, and army saufly set a lond. She seeth Aeneas glad, and plats vprise for men to dwell, And nauy desert stand: with boyling moode her brest doth swell. Than shaking mad her head, her wrathfull hart did thus expell. A new vexation by Iuno.O hated broode, O spitefull fortune, mee that alway frets, This fortune vile of Troy, how euery chaunce my purpose lets? Were they not cleane downkilled? yet could they not be clean distroid? Were they not caught? yet could they not be caught? hath fier th? noid? Hath burning Troy th? burnt? but through y? throngs, &amp; through y? fiers They found away? I weene against their lucke my power expiers. Or haue I lest my wrath? and yet not filde am falne at rest? Expulsed from their land I them pursued, and downe opprest With totall power of stormes, and totall seas on them I brought. Both force of skies and deepes on them I spent, and all for nought. What good did Scylla mee? what could preuaile Charybdis wood? Or Sirtes parlous sands? be they not now in Tyber flood? In spite of seas, and mee? and where they wisht are setled sure? Yet Mars could haue the might to kil downe quite without recure, The hugie Centaurs kinde. Diana did of gods obtaine, On auncient Calidon to wreake, while one man did remaine. For what offence? or how could Centaurs so, such wrath deserue? But I, the mighty spouse of Ioue, whom all things els should serue? That nothing left vntried, to euery shift my selfe transformd, My strength, my practise spent, and yet my purpose vnperformd: Aeneas makes mee shrinke, and Troyes of mee shal conquest crake. What should I therfore doubt where euer I can my frends to make? Since heauens I may not mooue, yet pits of Hell I will vprake. From Italy to keepe them of, no shift I see can holde. Let passe Lauinia wedded needes shalbe by destnie tolde. Yet still prolong the time, and discord foule betweene them breede, And peoples both distroy, were in my minde a worthy deede. The stepson and the father both, shal haue their loueday fee, With Troians and with Rutils blood, this wenche endowde shalbee. This Venus goodly broode, and second Paris, fine and nice, She resembleth him to Paris, whose mother in vision semed to bring forth a fier brond Alecto is reysed. Shall bring againe to dust this second Troy, by mine aduise, Nor Priams wife alone shalbe, whose wombe a brond of fier, To world did bring, but like successe I giue this gentle squier. These things whan she had said, adown on earth she greesly falles, From darke infernall damps, Alecto mournfull vp she calles. Alecto foulest fende, in dolefull warres that doth delite, And wrathes, and treasons vile, and sinnes, and slaunders, and despite. A dampned monster grim, whom all her sisters deadly hates, Her father Pluto lothes, and euermore she breedes debates. Such faces foule she shiftes, so many mouthes she turning makes, So serpentfull she seemes, and ouer all begrowen with snakes. Whom Iuno quickned thus, and soone with speeche she set on fier. Thou childe of night: Do (virgin) this for mee at my desier. Uirgin for none will haue her. This trauaile shalbe thine, let not our honour shrinke nor quaile, Let not the Troians league with king Latinus ought preuaile. Nor let them land obtaine, nor yet this wedlocke to perswade, Thou best canst worke this feate: Of strife and wo thou hast the trade. Thou freendships all canst cut, and brethren kinde constraine to fight, And townes vntwine with hate, and cities whole subuert with spight, And houses burne with bronds, a thousand shiftes thou hast to spill, A thousand names of harmes, now shake thy selfe, and worke thy fill. Giue causes thicke of war, disturbe this peace that is begonne, Set all their youth in armes, and to their slaughters let them ronne. She tarieth not to answerAnon Alecto vile, with poisons ranke infected, flies. And first to Latium land, and vp king Latines house she sties, And to the Queene Amata first in secret sort she slides, Behinde her chamber doore, and close her selfe in silence hides, Amata y? queene vered by Alecto.Where shee, with comming of this Troian nation much turmoyld, Both Turnus care and wrath, her female brest enflaming broyld. To whom this goddesse, from her vgly hear one viper blew Did draw, and in her bosom soft against her hart she threw. That therby all her house with sondry mischiefes should be vext. Hee creeping through her clothes, her tender breast approching next, Did folde himselfe vnfelt, and serpents foule within her breathes. Than shifting sondry shappes, about her necke himselfe he wreathes, And seemes a golden cheine, sometimes a hearlace long to knit, To rolle her lockes, and thus from lim to lim doth fall and flit. And while the poison first, and tickling sting with soking sinkes, And gropes her gristlebones, and venim drops her fences drinkes, Nor yet in minde the burning flame did rage without restraint, More soberly she spake, as mothers vse, and made her plaint, Oft weeping for her child, and oft for Troians wedlocke day. To wandring outlawes shall Lauinia thus be giuen away? O man: nor of your selfe regard, nor doughter mercy showes? Nor mee her mother (wretch) whom with the next northwind y? blowes This traitour will forsake? and to the seas the pyrat theefe, Our virgin doughter steale, and spoyle from mee my comfort cheefe? Dissembling rouer vile? hath not the like, ere this be seene? Did Paris so not cloyne from lands of Greece dame Helen queene? Where is your godly minde? your wonted carck of contrey deere? And faith so often plight in Turnus hand, your kinsman neere: If son in law from contreys straunge, wee only must admit, As Faunus answers bids, and in your breast it doth so sit: All landes that of themselues from our estate are seuered cleane, I call them straunge, and so I take, in deede the gods do meane. Than Turnus (if ye list his elders line to call in minde) Of great Micena towne, and mids of Greece you shall him finde, Of Inachus descent, and of Acrisius noble kinde. With language like, whan she Latinus minde in vaine had felt, And seeth him still withstand, and poyson more did inward melt, Which from the serpent shed, and all her limmes infecting straied: Than verily with monsters huge affright, and deepe dismaied, She railing rampes &amp; runnes, and through the towne she troubleth all. Much like, as whan by strength of sling is cast a whirling ball, This play is yet vsed in Wales, &amp; the bal is called knappen. Whom boyes for their disport, in cloyster wide, or vacant halles Intentif driue with noise. It thrown with force, before them falles. The carelesse prease pursues, with wondring much the bowl of boxe, From youth to youth that rolles, their courage kindleth more by knoxe. None otherwise, and with no lesse concours she gads about, Through cities mids and townes, and people thicke she gathereth out. Besides all this in woods, with fayning feast of Bacchus name, Bacchus tri?phes: much like to our morice daunces in s?mer. A greater mischiefe springs, and fransie more and voide of shame, She flies abroad, and in the bushie hilles her doughter hides, The Troians to preuent, while day of wedlocke passing slides. With heaue and hoaw, on Bacchus name they shout. For thee alone, This virgin worthy is, thou shalt her wed or neuer none. Thou god, thy custome is, to shake triumphant hie thy speares, Commotion of women. Thy chiefe delite is daunse, thou comly keepest thy holy heares. The Fame outflies, &amp; madnesse like enflames the mountayne wiues, To seeke them dwellinges new, the Queenes example out them driues. Their houses all they leaue, and with their heares disheuilid bare, Their naked neckes they wag, and frantiklike they rage and fare. Some other lift their voyce, and skies they fill with quauering shricks, And girt in skinnes they iet, with vinetree garlands borne on prickes. Her selfe among the mids with flaming torch in hand outspringes, Proclames her doughter bryde, and Turnus wedlockes feast she singes. With wrestling wilde her face, and sodenly with bloodread eyen She makes a noyse. O matrons wise, O freends, O subiectes mine, Who euer Latine blood doth loue, and you that mothers bee, Unlace your heades attire, and celebrate this daunce with mee. To Bacchus let vs singe and to the mountaines out go wee, If any gentell hart doth pitie this my wofull plight, If any touched be with iust remorse of mothers right. Thus into desert mountaine woods, and hauntes of beastes vnmilde, Alecto stinging driues this carefull Queene with madnesse wilde. Whan she with mischiefe such king Latins counsell troubled had, And topsituruy tost his houshold all with sorowes sad: Alecto incenseth Turnus king of y? Rutils, to whom the virgin was despoused. Arde in Italy.Incontinent this dolefull dame vpsterts, with waylfull winges, And to the walles of Turnus bold, in Rutil realme, she flinges. Which citie, whan dame Danae by stormes was cast on ground, Men say she first did builde, and for a vow the same did found. A place, which of our gransirs olde did Ardea name obtaine, Of anticke date, and yet the name of great Arde doth remaine. The fortune, sometime was: there Turnus king in toures of might, Was taking sweete his rest, and sleeping sound at darke midnight. Alecto than, her frowning face, and fendly limmes of wormes Puts of, and to a woman olde in likenesse her transformes. Her forhead foule with wrinckels long she plowes, &amp; horewhite heares In cap and kerchiefe knits, and Oliue braunch theron she weares. Like Calibee, dame Iunos temple Sexten, old of yeeres. And sodenly before his eies with these wordes she appeeres. Why Turnus? wilt thou see thy labours long thus lost in vaine? And canst thou suffer Troian clownes thy kingdome thus obtaine? King Latin thee reiectes, and with thy blood that thou hast bought, Thy wedlocke he denies, and heyres of aliens in are brought. Go now, go venture yet thy selfe in danger, laught to skorne. Go fight, and vanquish yet the Tirrhens host, their enmies sworne. Bring Latines to their peace, and kill their foes, for thanke forlorne. These things to thee to tell (where now thou liest in pleasant rest) Almighty Iuno bad, and mee this time on message drest. Wherfore come of, in mustring call thy youth, and through thy landes In harneis put thy power, come boldly forth with all thy bandes, And Troians now by Tiber flood that sit, with captaines all, Destroy them downe to death, and burne their ships resist that shall, The great assent of heauenly gods so bids, and king Latine, If he refuse to obey, and to thy wedlocke due encline: Than let him feele, and Turnus power at last repenting know. The bachler hearing this, to her in mocking made a mow. Than thus he said. The nauy lately brought to Tiber shore, Not as thou doost coniect, hath been to mee vntolde before. Faine mee no needelesse feare, no such tumult, nor Iuno Queene Unmindefull is of vs. But thou a doting trot, whom withryd age from trueth exiles, In vaine thy self doost vexe, with causelesse carke (O foole therwhiles) And kings affaires, &amp; wars with needelesse feare thy minde begiles. More meete thy temple keepe, and serue thy gods good aged crone. To men belongs the wars, let men with wars and peace alone. In talking thus: Alecto flaming wood with wrathfull looke Uprose, and sodenly his limmes a trembling palsie tooke. His eyes vpstaring stoode such sundry faces out she sets, So many hissing snakes, so many waies she foming frets. Than burning broad w? eyes, as he in space would more haue spoke, She thrust him of, &amp; serpents twaine from among her locks she broke And strake him, loud th? fr? her mouth these words she kest w? smoke Lo, I the doting trot whom witherid age from trueth exiles, Whom kinges affaires and wars with needlesse carke affraid begiles, Looke hereupon: lo, here I am, of hags infernall most, Both warres, and death in hand I bring. So speaking, to the yonge mans brest a firebrond hoat she cast, With blustring smoky light, and in his hart she fixt it fast. Than from his dead sleepe feare him brake, his bones and all his lims On water brasting out, and streaming swet down gushing swims. For armour, mad he crieth, for armour, house, and bed he turnes, With cursed rage of warres, and loue of steele that inward burnes. His wrath vpswels, as whan a caudron great is set on fire, And stickes are kindled fast, and flame with noise doth close vpspire, The liquor leapes for heate, and water waues vptossing toyles In smoke, and ouer flowing flood of fome redounding boyles, Nor can it selfe receiue, the vapor blacke in ayer vp flies. A choyce therfore of youth to king Latine to send he hies, Renounsing league of peace, and bids him straight prepare to fight, To cleare the coast from foes, and to defend Italias right, Or hee against them both with power sufficyng will descend. Whan this was said, his gods he calles with vows, good lucke to send. Than straight the Rutils striue, who shalbe first to serue the wars, Eche man himselfe exhorts, him beauty fresh of youth prefars. Him kings his gransirs moues, him deeds of armes before time tried, While Turnus thus the Rutils mindes with boldenesse fiercely plied: Alecto trobleth y? Troians. Alecto to the Troian nation drew, and foule with winges, For new deuise a place she spies, and theron swift she springes. Where fayre Ascanius stood, and on the shore the time to passe With engins after beastes, and course of running hunting was. There sodenly, among his houndes, this virgin vile of Hell Did cast a traine, and by the suite their noses fild with smell, A Harte to finde and rouse, which afterward of mischiefs all Was chiefest cause, and first the plowmen made to fighting fall. A tame stag.A Harte there was of comely porte, and huge with hornes yspred, Whom Tirrhus children (from the dug withdrawen) for pleasure bred, And Tirrhus great their sier, that for the king had all the charge Of beastes, and trusted was with heardes that fed in pastures large. Him tame at euery becke their sister Siluia deere did loue, And wreathing garland flowres, would trimly trick his hornes aboue, And pure in fountaines wash, and comely kembe his wanton lockes. He suffring euery hand, his maisters bourd, and feeding flockes Did vse, and thence abroad in woods, and through his wonted gate, He would returne to home, though night on him were nere so late. Him wandring loofe astray, where childe Ascanius swift did hunt, His houndes before them had, as hee by custome kept his wont, To soyle himselfe in flood, and vnder banckes to voyde the heat. Ascanius kindled than, with loue of praise and corage great, His dart for ioy outdrew, and crooked bowe he bent of horne, Desirous of that stag, and seldom saw the like beforne. Nor from his hand the goddesse absent was, but sharpely sent The quarrey through the paunch, &amp; through the guts w? sounding went. The wounded beast forthwith vnto his maisters house he drew, And brayed with piteous noise, and wailings loud he bleeding threw, Like one beseeching helpe, and all the house with mourning vext. Their sister Siluia beating both her handes, for wo perplext, Out calles the hines for ayde and plowmen tough, &amp; neighbors next. They sodenly (for in the woods the plage yet lurking sat) Assembling flocke themselues, one brought in hand a burned bat, Another caught a club, with heauy knobs, and what they found Echman outbrings, wrath wepon makes, them Tirrhus gathreth round As hee by chaunce that time with earnest minde an oke did cliue In quarter shides, and wedges strong with force therin did driue. He tooke his axe, and downe with threatning huge descending blowes, But from her tooting place Alecto foule that mischiefe sowes, (Whan she her time espied) she flew, and tooke the houses hie, And on the stable top she sat, to reare the countrey crie. Her fendly voice she lifts, in crooked crinkled horne on height, And blew the heardmans blast, and wonted signe to rise and fight, So loude: y? with the sound therof, the trees with trembling shakes, And caues of mountaine rocks, &amp; woods of deepnes thondring makes. The lakes aloofe it heard, and floods and fountaines neighbours all, And sulphur streames of Nar and mountaine waters downe that fall, And trembling mothers to their breast did clasp their children small. Than verily vnto that noyse, where first their trompet blew, The contrey clownes vprose, with tooles, and wepons thick they drew, Stifnecked plowmen stoute: the Troian youth also brake out, With open campe, and to Ascanius rescue drew for doubt. Their armies out they spreade not now like fraies of countries chubs, Nor worke with burned bats, nor sharped stakes, nor mountaine clubs. But trie with edged tooles, and euery feelde with swords vpright, As stubble starckly stands, &amp; thicke with pointes of weapons pight, The sheelde with sun vpshines, and to the cloudes repulse their light. As whan the tempest riseth first, and seas doth white begin By small and small to swell, and belching flouds reboyle within, At last aloft it mountes, and to the skies the bottom skips. Before the voward first, an arowe swift that sounding slips, Doth Almon throw to ground, that Tirrhus childe and eldest was, Beneath his throat it stacke, and where his breath and voice should pas It stopt, and with his tender life expiring left his blood. About him bodies thicke of men, and olde Galesus good In medling making peace, a man of right and iustnesse most That was, and greatest wealth sometime in all Italia cost Fiue flockes of sheepe he had, and heards of cattels feeding fiue, And soile so much did turne, as plowes a hundred still did driue. While these things working were w? equal chaunce on both the parts, The spitefull Goddesse spied so great successe in all her artes, And peoples fierce of both, with blood and battell full embrewd, And saw their armies ioynt in slaughters vile together glewd: She left Italia land, and through the skies of compas wide, Dame Iuno to she comes, and thus she spake with bragging pride. Lo thy request is done, now strife, and warres among them is, Alecto to Iuno.Go bid them freendly ioyne, and louingly like neighbors kisse. Since Troians haue begun Italians blood thus much to spill, Yet more I shal augment (if I may know it be thy will.) The townes and borders next I wil with rumours set on fier, And make them such vprore, that battels mad they shal desier, And bustling run to helpe, and euery feelde with armour spreede. Than Iuno said: ynough there is of false deceit and dreede, Good causes stands of war. Together now I see they run, With bloodshed both embrued, this game of thine is wel begun. Such wedlocks let them make, that goodly broode, that Venus elfe. Such feast is for them fit, and for the king Latine him selfe. Thy person ouer mortall skies with longer leaue to stray, The guider great of heauen for ease of mankinde doth denay. Giue place this time, if any chaunce or trauaile be behinde, My selfe shal take that charge. So Iuno speaking told her minde. She mounting forth did flie, with squeaking wings of lothly snakes, And leauing light of skies, her wonted seat in Hell she takes. Description of a place in Italy where Alecto went downe to Hell.In mids of Italy, there is a place in mountaines colde, Right notable, and for the maruell much in contreys tolde. A darsome vale and deepe, with woods encompast thicke on sides, And headlong downe there sinkes, in mids of rocks that hils deuides, A roring stinking poole, and breaking stones the brooke doth sound. A dongeon darke there is, and dreedful gulfe of gaping ground, Where deadly breath outbreakes. Alecto there (so god did please) Did hide her hatefull head, and heauen and earth therby did ease. Nor nothing lesse this while, dame Iunos hand did working cease. The numbers all of heardes, vnto the citie came with prease, To king Latinus court, and brought in sight the bodies twayne, Of Almon flouring lad, and good Galesus fouly slayne. They crie their gods for ayde, and to the king their case complayne. In mids of that, is Turnus nere at hand, with sworde and fire He threatneth Latin king, that Troians wedlocke would require. Outlandish blood brought in, himselfe reiect, the realme defilde. Than from the woods the wiues, whom Bacchus daunce astoined wilde Came ramping down w? droms, y? queenes respect doth giue them sprite. From euery coast men come, and with the Troians crie to fight, Eche one against all right, against all gods, for war doth call, The subiectes swarming rise, and to king Latins court they fall. Hee, like a rocke in seas resisting stands, vnmooued, fast, Full like a rocke in seas, whan surging waues with winde are cast, Whom strokes of water strikes, with barking sound, and beates about, It selfe with weight it staies, the floods in vaine their foming spout, With ratling loud of stones the sides repulse the fleeting weedes. Whan nothing doth preuaile, and blinde outrage his counsell leedes, And after Iunos becke he seeth how backward thinges appeeres, Protesting much his gods, and aier of skies that nothing heeres, We run to wracke (quoth he) that wo is mee, with tempest borne. Your selues shall first repent, and pay for this your blood forsworne. O wretched soules, O sinfull Turnus, thou shalt bide the paines, And call to late thy gods, a dolefull death for thee remaines. For I am safe at rest, my feeble ship is brought to shore, Of happy funerals I am dispoyld. And made no talking more But lockt himselfe in walles, and rule of things did cleane forsake. The maner was in Latium land, which cities all did take, And sacred custome kept, now Rome most mighty still retaines. Whan first their wars they moue, or for renowne will take the paines Description of Ianus temple at Rome y? neuer was shut but in peace and most in Augustus time. Ianus had two faces wherby was signified prudence to looke both before and behind in beginning of warre. To conquer seas or landes, or to the Moores giue mortall wars, To nations vnder North, and countreys distant far from stars, Or peirce with power to Inde, and seeke the seat of morning sun, Or from the Parthies people fetch, with bloudshed standards won: Two gates of war there bee, for so their names at Rome they beare, Religious, sacred kept to dredfull Mars, and temple there, A hundred brasen boltes, and euerlasting strength of steele Doth locke the same, and Ianus keeper stands at threshold heele. These gates, whan sentence first of fight the lordes haue full decreed, Himselfe the Consull chiefe, in robes of pompe, and purple weede, In warlikewise begyrt, with rombling noise abroade displaies. And first proclames the wars, than al the youth in their araies. And blastes of brasen hornes with hoarce assent concording braies. In such a sort, king Latin than the Troians to defie Commaunded was, but hee the greeuous gates would not come nie, The good prince did refuse, and from that seruice vile he fled, And kept him selfe in close, and vnder darkenes hid his hed. Dame Iuno than her selfe, the queene of heauen, adown did slide, And tooke the lingring gates, and shouing set them open wide, Them turning swift with noise, and brasen postes and hinges brast. Than all Italia land (vnmooued earst) their peace vpcast. Uncald they stur themselues, some runs as footemen fierce in feelde, Some stur their startling steeds, &amp; dust vpthrowes &amp; speares they weeld. Eche man for armour cries, and some their sheeldes and harneis light With fat of lard they scoure, &amp; whetstones hacke to make them bright. Their streamers glad they beare, &amp; trompets sound with ioy they here. Fiue cities great therfore, with forges set in contreys nere, Renew them fighting tooles, both Tyber proud, and Atin stronge, And Arde, and Crustum toures, and great Antemna large and longe. Their metall masse they bowe, and for their heads the stedfast plates, And buckler bosses broade, and wickers weaue for target grates. Some beat them coates of brasse, or sturdy brestplate hard they driue, And some their gauntlets gilde, or bootes with siluer nesh contriue. Regard of shares and culters all they leaue, both sithe and plough They turne to this, &amp; swordes, and glauies, in furneis neale they tough. And sagbuts now they found, vp goeth the signe to battell strokes. One gets his sheelde for hast, an other swift his horses yokes In chace to ride, and helmet bright on puts, threedubbled shyrtes Of Golde, with gorget great, and trusty sworde about him gyrtes. He describeth y? musters, &amp; gathering of princes conspired against Aeneas.Now Muses mooue my songe, now let me sup your learning springs, To tell what nations tough, what captaines fierce, what noble kinges. With armies filde the feeldes, what armour stronge, what manred bold, Italia sacred land did flourishing that time vpholde. You ladies, you remember best, and vttring best can speake. Skant breathing thin of fame by vs doth passe with pipling weake. First entreth war from Tirrhen coast, Mezentius, tirant king, Despiser proude of Gods, and armies strong with him doth bring. Than Lausus next his son, whose corps in beauty peere had none That time, and chiefest fame did beare, saue Turnus corps alone. Prince Lausus, conquerour of beastes, and tamer stronge of steedes, A thousand men from Agillina towne him after leedes In vaine that followd him for loue: well worthy to haue had A father not so naught, and of his realme to be more glad. Next them, triumphant fierce with steedes that wager all did win, Duke Auentine, sir Hercles worthy seede, of heauenly kin, Uictoriously out shewes his charet faier, and bare in sheeld His fathers armes, a hundred dreadfull dragons huge to weeld, A hundred serpents grim, and Hidra monster girt with snakes, Whom Rhea virgin preest, as she to God her seruice makes, In Auentinus mount, and bushes thicke by stelth out brought Engendring mixt with God, whan Hercules had conquest wrought In Spayne, and Gerion downe kild, and to Italia strand Arriuing brought his beastes, and oxen faier had set a land. Their parlous pikes in hand, &amp; puncheons close in staues they beare, And pykes like broaches long, and fight with foyne of pointed speare. Him selfe on foote, a fold of Lions huge vnweldy hide, With brestlid heares vnkemt, and tusked white, and gaping wide In helmet wise did weare, so to the court he come full rough All terribel, and his fathers weede he bare on shoulders tough. Than brethren twaine of Tiber strong, forsooke Tiburtus walles, (A towne that of their brothers name the people yet so calles,) Both Coras and Catillus, eger knights of Greekish kinde, Before the voward went, in weapons thicke as swift as winde. Like Bulles, or misbegotten Centaures twaine, from cloudy hilles Descend with stamping noise, and hedlong downe with restles willes They run, that woods do rustling yeld, and bowes with breaking crack, Nor of Prænesta towne, the founder first therof did lacke Vulcanus dredfull sun, a king of beastes and mountaines cold, A fondling found besides a fier (as all report hath told) King Ceculus, a legion large of heardmen next his side, And men of hie Præneste towne, and all that compas wide, Dame Iunos sacred land, and Auiena riuer chill, And all that Hernick stones (with watry springs bedewed) do till. Whom Amasoni pastures feedes, and ritch Anagnia feelds. Nor harneis to them all, nor charrets ratling ben, nor sheelds, The greatest sort with slings, their plummet lompes of lead outsquats. And some their sheues of dartes, their heads defensed broade with hats Of heary skins of wolues, their rightside shankes be naked bare. Such is their shift, their leftside legs with raw hides couered are. But king Messapus, Neptunes child, that coursers wild can tier, Whom neither strength of steele can ouerthrow, nor force of fier, His peoples long in rest, and out of vre of battell strife, Doth sodenly vpcall, and teach to handle sword and knife. They from their Fescen hilles, and from Faliscus equall toftes, They from Soractus towers, and yelow feeldes of Flauine croftes, And mount of Ciminus with lake, where Capens woods outsprang, By numbers like they went, and on their king in praise they sang. As swannes, that in the wauering clouds do flie, with sounding sweet, Returning from their foodes, whan singing flockes in one do meete, With stretched necks, their melody they yeeld, their mixed voyce, Rebounding beates the skies, that lakes and riuers do reioyce, And Asia longe aloofe. Nor by their noyse men knew, that harnest bands their clattring cast. But like a cloude of foules, that from the seas were forced fast, And neare to shore were come, &amp; hoarce with cries their chanel past. Behold from Sabines auncient blood, sir Clausus doth proceede, With mighty throng, and like a thronge him selfe, asmuch to dreede. From whom descending comes both tribe, and house of Claudia line In Latium land, since Rome to Sabines first did part incline. Togither Amiterna manred strong, and burgeis townes, And all Mutusca strength, that Oliues beare, and all their downes, They that Nomentum citie kept, and rosy countreis pure Of Velin, and Seuerus hilles, and all that thought them sure In Tetrix rocky crags, and such as turne the fertile soyle Of Forulos, and where Himella streame full fast doth boyle. And they that Tiber waters drinkes, or Fabaris good floods. Or whom Casperia sent, or Nursia colde for want of woods. And peisants all of Latine land, and seamen come from ships, Allia a riuer where the Romans had diuers ouer throwes, &amp; therfore cursed it.And all that feete in cursed streames of dampned Allia dips. As thicke as winter waues in marble seas are turnd and tost, Whan stormes and tempest rise, and sight of stars and light is lost. Or like to standing corne, that parched is with heat of sonne: So thicke the people prease, from euery coast to war they ronne. The ratling shieldes resound, the soyle with trampling beaten quakes, Than Agamemnons childe, an enmy olde of Troy, awakes, Halesus, borne on steedes, and to king Turnus armies great, A thousand people bringes, of them that ground with mattockes beat To till the blisfull vaines, and they that rake the mountaines fat Of Messica, and nere the seas all husbandmen that sat. And all Auruncus youth, and they that Caleis land forsooke, And dwellers all beside the fourdes of sholde VVlturnus brooke. Saticula their testy people sent, and Osca strength, Their weapons troncheons be, and malles of maces, small of length, But them by lethrin thongs they while and draw, such is their gise, Their lefthands Targets keepe, and hooded Fawchons from them flies. Nor thou from this accompt, and verses mine shalt passe vntolde O Ebalus, whom Telon gat (as goeth reporte of olde) Of lady Sebethis (that Nimphe) whan he the kingdome bent Of Capreas, and landes, but not his sonne therwith content, Sarrastes people riche with empier sore that time did tread, And welthy countries large, where Sarnus brooke to sea doth lead. And they that Batulus doth holde, and Rufas feeldes obiect, And all that frutefull vale, that Bella city may prospect. Like Almain rutters, borespeares longe they whirle, or foyning forks, Their nuddockes bolstred ben, &amp; skulles of heads with barkes of corks. They shine w? brasen sheelds, they shine with swords, &amp; rapiers bright. And thee to warres thy countrey Nursa sent, O noble knight, O Vfens, much renowmed both of deedes, and great good chaunce, Whose mountaine people strong, with practise long of sword &amp; launce, And hunting still in woods, and breaking clots ben hard of flesh. They weaponed till the ground, and euermore their prayes a fresh They fetch from countreys nere, it doth them good to driue and watch. They liue by bootie spoyle, it is their owne what ere they catch. Than from Marrhubia there came a Priest, and prophet gay, His helmet compas knit with lucky bowes of Oliue spray, From king Archippus sent, most valiaunt knight of Vmber land, That woonted was with songes, and with his charmes, and holy hand, All poysoned adders kinde, and serpentes dreadfull cast on sleepe, And calme their wrathes &amp; stinges, &amp; from their biting peoples keepe, And ease with art their wounds, and venims all confound and choke. But not the Troyan blade could hee auoyd, nor heale the stroke Of great Aeneas dint, nor to his woundes could helpe him ought His sleeping songs in vain, nor lechecraft herbes on mountains sought. For thee, the woods did wayle, for thee the fountaines cleare as glasse, For thee, the waters wept, and lakes lamenting cried alas In all Angitia land. Than of Hyppolitus also, the childe most worthy went, Syr Virbius, whom fresh of fame his mother Aritia sent, Brought vp in saluage wood, and by the bancks of holsome streames Of dame Dianas walke, and Nimphe Egerias desert realmes. For whan Hyppolitus (by olde report) was put to paine, And by his stepdams craft, was of his father giltlesse slaine, In peeces drawn with steedes, againe to breath and worldly skies, He was (men say) vpcald, and eft from death to life did rise, By power of Phœbus herbes, and at Dianas sute for loue. The almighty father than, and king of heauen that reygnes aboue, Disdaining, that a mortall man from dead soules might reuart: Esculapius was thro time to Limbo for reising of Hyppolitus to life.The finder of that phisick first, and him that made that art, (Apollos learned son) with lightning dint to Lymbo threw. Diana than, Hyppolitus to secret woods withdrew From sight of man, and to Egeria Nimphe did him betake, Where hee alone in desert groues doth worldly care forsake, Nor praise of people seekes, but leading life as he best can, Virbius. i. bis vir.He yet remaines, with name conuerted Virbius, twise a man. Therfore it is, that from Dianas woods, and temples cleere All horses ben forbid, nor to her seruice may come neere. For they affraied did flee, at sight of monsters than that sprang From seas, and down the yong man threw, and charet ouerflang. Yet nerethelesse his son, couragiously with horse in feeld Did run, and firisprited steeds in charet fierce did weeld. Turnus.Himselfe among the chiefe, with valiant body, Turnus bright, Displaies himselfe in armes, aboue all men with head vpright. Whose triple crowned creast, and helmet hie, with vgly pawes Chimera monster holdes, and sparcling flames she spoutes at iawes. The more she fretting fumes, &amp; more with burnings waxeth wood, The more that fighting feeldes embrew them selues in sheding blood. But on his target smoothe, dame Io stands, with hornes vpright, Imboasid pure in gold, euen like a cow, with hear in sight. A storie huge to learne: and Argus, with his hundred eien, Did keepe that virgin there, so portraid was that worck deuine: And Inachus his noble streame did powre from pitcher fine. A cloud of footemen following him pursues, and mixt with dust, The shields &amp; harneis dimmes, &amp; clustring thick in throngs they thrust As well the Greekish youth, as all the strength of Rutill handes, Auruncus ayde, and all Sicanus cities auncient bandes. Sacrana crewes, Labicus painted bucklers, and besides All such as Tyber hilles, and sacred shore therof deuides, That Rutil ground vpgrubs, and with their shares apply the soyle, And all that on the mountaines necke of Circes seat do toyle, And Anxurs holy hilles, where Ioue himself is patron chiefe. Faronia ioyfull towne, of greene wood groue that tooke reliefe. The way that Vfens mighty streame doth stray, &amp; blacke with pooles, Doth seeke by deepest vales, and in the seas himselfe he cooles. And ouer this, there came from Volsca realme, Camilla stout, With trowpes of horsemen fresh, and glistring footemen many a rout. Camillas Lady. She closid last her crewes, a woman warlike, strong and sterne. She neither weauing tooles, nor distaffe worke did vse or lerne. Nor female fingers had, but bruntes of warres Virago grim Would beare, and ouerpasse the windes, with lightnes swift of lym. She for a pastime would, on crops vpright of standing corne Haue flowen, and with her tender feet, haue neuer an eare down borne. Or in the mids of seas, on swelling waues before they reele, Would course haue fet, and neither dipt in water, toe nor heele. From houses all and feeldes, the youth with wondring issued out, And matrons gasing stood, both how she rides behind the rout, How princely purple keepes her shoulders light, how trim her heares With gold are vnderknit, her quiuer gorgeous how she beares, And dreadfull launce of length, and pointed like to fosters speares. DEO GRATIAS. Per Thomam Phaer, in foresta Kilgerran finitum .iij. Decembris. Anno. 1557. Opus xij. dierum. THE EIGHT BOOKE of the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. Turnus giueth a signe of war out of Laurentum castle, and ioyneth vnto him self in ayd all Latium, and the cities neare about: Venulus also is sent to Arpos vnto Diomedes to perswade him to war by likenes of the danger. Wherat Aeneas moued, &amp; distrusting the smalnesse of his power: is admonished by Tiberinus, &amp; brought vp along the riuer into that place where Rome was afterward builded, and there requireth ayde of king Euander, who flying forth of Arcadia: founded a citie vpon the hill Palatinus, called Pallanteum. When Euander vnderstood y? cause of Aeneas comming, he courteously receaueth him into his house, and taking him with him vnto the sacrifice and solemnities of Hercules wherin he was then busie: sheweth him the cause, and the maner of the sacrifice, and reciteth to his gest the names of the chiefest places in those quarters. The next day Aeneas being ayded with four hundred horsemen whom Pallas, Euanders only sonne did gouerne, the one part of the power he sendeth vnto his men downe the streame, him selfe with the residue goeth to Agylla, the most flourishing citie of Tyrrhens, who bare deadly hatred agaynst Mezentius, whom for his intollerable cruelty, they had driuen out of his kingdome. In this while, Vulcane entised therto by the flattery of Venus maketh armour for his son in law, which she bringeth vnto Aeneas. Who being surprised with the beutie therof: diligently wondreth at euery thinge therin, especially his Targat, wherin were curiously engrauen such noble exploytes as should be valiantly atchiued, by his worthy posteritie. When signe of war from Laurent towres king Turnus vp did reare, And hornes vp blowen w? blastes, their trembling tunes full hoarce did teare, Wh? first his egre steeds, &amp; armour clattring gan to clash: Mens mindes molested rose, and sodenly vnbrydeled rash The youth for madnesse runnes, all Latin townes for quaking feare Tumultuous clustring ioyne, and league confeddring knit they sweare Messapus and duke Vfens leaders chief, and puft with pride Mezentius gods dispiser, power of men from euery side They draw, and voide of tilmen wide dispeopling spoyle the shyrne. Then to the mighty towne of Diomedes with desires Is Venulus out sent, his needefull strength in time to call, Instructed plaine by mouth, what thing to him declare he shall: How Troians to Italia landes are come, and what a fleete Aeneas bringes of ships, and how their gods that vnder feete Were conquerd late by Greekes, he now exalting sets in fame, And king will needes be cald, and saith him destnie giues that name. Dilatyng more, how many nations been that ioygne their deedes With Troy: and how the Troian name in Latium shrewdly spreedes. What these beginnings meane, &amp; if his chaunce should giue successe What sequel worke he would, more manifest him self may gesse Then either Turnus kyng, or kyng Latinus list expresse. Such woorke in Latium land there was. All which considering great, The Troian prince did view, and floods of care his breast did beat. His wisdome swift now here, now there, he kest, and did deuide In sundry thoughts his minde, and eche deuise he tost and tried. As in some brasen cawdrons lips, where water standing streames, When sun reflected shines, or face of Moone with quiuering beames, The twinckling light vp leapes, eche corner seekes and flickering flits, Now hie, now low, and tops of house, and rafters wauering hits. Then was it night, and creatures all that weery were on ground, Both byrds &amp; groueling kindes of beasts deepe sleape hath setled sound: When lorde Aeneas vnderneath colde skies in sight of stars, Perturbed much in minde with troublous carcks of heauy wars As on a banke he sat, sore musing sad with careful brest: He layd him downe at last, and late his limmes he gaue to rest. To him the god of Tiber flood, which rules that pleasant place, Tyber a riuer nigh Rome. In vision showed himself, vprising graue with antique face, Among the Poppler leaues in grisell gowne of dropping weedes, A sayle his shoulders spred, his hear beshadowed was with reedes, Than speaking thus, Aeneas hart with comfort wordes he feedes. O heauenly childe of gods, that Troy destroyed doost new restore, Which bringst vs Troian wals, and lasting wealth for euermore, Long looked for of Laurent feeldes, and townes of Latium great, Here is thy certein house, do thou not shrinke thy certein seat, Nor feare thee not for all these threatnings huge: all dreede and yres Of gods appeased cease. And now to thee (least fansie vaine this dreame thou do suppose) A Sow of mightie sise furth with thou shalt see layd in woase Beneth a banke, among the rootes, with thirtie sucklings out, All white her selfe on ground, and white her brats her dugs about, There shall thy citie stand, there is thy rest of labours last: Where thy Ascanius prince, whan ten times three of yeres are past, Shal famous Alba builde, and of that surname call this land. No fables I pronounce, now of this thing thou hast in hand, How thou shalt victour bee: giue eare in briefe I will thee tell. A nation on these fronters cald Arcadia neare doth dwell, From Pallants line they came, and king Euander vp they tooke, They chase their place, and citie builded on that mountaines nooke, Which of his grandsier Pallant slaine, now Palanteum hights. This nation with Latinus folkes, discording dayly fights. Take them to thy reliefe, &amp; league with them compound and smight. My selfe along these bancks shal thee conduct with passage light, Against these streames with Ores, that nothing let thy speede to stay. Arise, go to thou goddesse son, and first when stars decay To Iuno make thy vow, her threatning moode and wrathful tene With praiers meekely please: and when thy conquests ended bene, Than mee thou shalt reward, for I am hee that fleeting deepe Do straine these bancks thou seest, and pastures fat do feede and keepe, Most ioyfull Tyber blue, best liked streame to heauens on hie, Here is my mighty house, here cities great my head may spie. He sayd: And sodainly his flood, he foltring mixt in lake From sight. Aeneas eies both night and sleepe did than forsake, He rose, and with his face vpright against the mounting sonne, Whan first his hands he dipt in waters pure that there did ronne, He held them vp to skies, and thus his voice he straight begonne. O Nimphes, O Laurent Nimphes, O Queene of streams &amp; waters cleere, And thou O Tyber O thou blessed flood and father deere, Receaue Aeneas now, and from these daungers last defend. Where euer sacred lake, that pitie such doost vs extend In our extreme distresse, what euer soyle and fountaine faire Conteines thy holy head, vnto thy seate will I repaire. Mine honours euer due, and euer gifts thou shalt haue good, Hornfronted kingly god, of westerne streames Imperial flood, Be with vs, O this time, and all thy grace do prosper full. So spake he than, and from his fleete two barges apt doth cull, With rancks of rowers twaine, and all his campe in armour set. Behold, for sodenly their eyes a wondrous monster met. For by the shore among the rootes on ground in greenewood shawe A Sowe of syse vnseene, all colour white with broode they sawe. This sowe was prophecied of before. Whom good Aeneas vnto thee (O Iuno most of powre) Euen all to thee he kild, and on thine altars did auowre. That liuelong night did Tyber flood his streames downe couch &amp; calme With lingring soft, that neither moouing made of waue nor walme, But milde most like a poole, or pleasant ponde of water dull, So setled smooth it stood, that nothing lets their Ores to pull. Their way therfore begun with talking cherely plied they fast: Thannoynted Firtree slides, by shelues and fourdes along they past. The waters wondring stoode, and woods with wondring gasing made At shining sheeldes of men, far glistring straunge of newcome trade, They gase at gorgeous ships, and painted pups aloft that swims. They plucking swift their Ores, that night and day do tyre their lims, And reatches long they win, that trees with bowes do hide them oft, And circles wide they cut in waters greene of shadowes soft, And through the woods they wade, &amp; gladsom groues that grow a loft. The flaming sun his compast midst of heauen had entred in, When towre and walles they spie, and from a far the houses thin, Which now the Romain might to match the stars haue made so tal. They came where Rome now st?ds Euander king that time, that citie kept of substance small, They swiftly turne their ships, and to the towne approching fall. That day as fortune was, Euander king in solempne guise His patrone feast did keepe, with honours great to gods in skies. But vnto Hercules most chiefe, in greenewood groue vpstald Afront the towne. His onely son with him was, (Pallas cald) With him the chiefe of youth, and Senate counsell poore and good, To gods encense they gaue, on smoking altars moist of blood. When first the lofty ships they saw, and darke in shadowes lowe So sliding through the woods, and swift with Ores so silent rowe: With sodaine sight affraied they rose, and tables troubling reaue. Whom Pallas bold forbids that offrings holy they not leaue, Himselfe with sword outdrawne, against them fast to shore he flew. Then from the banke aloof, how sirs ? he? what causes new? What moues you thus these waies vnknow? to serch? wher would you light? What people? what place dwel you? bring you peace, or list you fight? Olive in token of peace.Than lord Aeneas from his pup on hie this answere told, And Oliue braunch in hand betokening peace he forth did hold. The men of Troy thou seest, and Troian weapons, Latins foes, Whom they with armour proud thus wandring still to driue dispose. Euander king we seeke, go cary this and say that knights Of Troians strong are come, and pray with him to ioyne our mights. At such a reuerent name, did Pallas then astonied stand. Come forth (quoth he) O prince, what euer thou art, and here at hand Go speake my father to, and strait his righthand clasping held, They landing left their flood, and to the frith they came and feld. Then lord Aeneas to the king these wordes did freendly moue. O best of Græcian blood, to whom dame Fortune strong aboue Compels me now to seeke, and bowes of peace and garlands beare, I nothing fearfull was, that thou of Greekes a leader were, And cosin neare in stocke, to twayne Atridas, Troian rods. But mee my valiant life, and holy motions great of Gods, Our Gransiers ioynt of blood, thy wide renoume in countreis spred Haue knit me thus to thee, and glad by destnies here haue led. How Aeneas &amp; Euander ar of kin.King Dardan founder first of Troian towne and parent old, That sun to Dame Electra was, as auncient Greekes haue told, To Troian kingdomes came, Electras father void of doubt Most mighty Atlas was, that heauens sustaines on shoulders stout. Your line from Mercury proceedes, whom May most white of hew, On olde Cilenes Mount, conceyuing bare by storie trew. Mayes father Atlas is, if iust report hath fild our eares, That Atlas her begat, that stars of heauen on shoulders beares, So both one blood we bee, from one good spring our stocke departes. These things considering I, by neither message, freend, nor artes, Did practise thee to groape, euen I my selfe my person here I ventred haue my head, and to thy court I sue most dere, That nation proude of Turnus land whose warres doth thee molest, The same doth vs likewise most deadly vexe, were we supprest Nothing they thinke should let, but all Italia landes at eas They may subdue with yoke, and East, and West possesse the seas. Receaue and render faith, we lacke no brestes in battaile bolde, Wee lacke no feruent mindes, and youth wel tried in warres of olde. He holding still his eyes his tale did harke, And fixed vewed his face, and lims and countenance all did marke. Few words at last he said: Most pusaunt lord (O prince of Troy) How glad am I of thee? how welcome here thou bringest me ioy? How well thy parent great thou doost present? his words and voyce Me thinkes I heare, in great Anchises face I do reioyce. For I remember wel, when Priam king in progresse went, To vew Hesiones his sisters lands, he was content From Salamina coast that time this countrey colde to know, Then flowing fresh in youth, my budding beard on cheekes did grow. I wondred at the Troian dukes, I wondred sore in dede Such princely states: But ouer all most hie Anchises yede, My youthfull minde for loue did in my brest with burning sit Till we acquainted were, and hand in hand conioyning knit. I led him furth, and to my towne of Pheney glad him brought. He vnto mee a quiuer riche, with arrowes finely wrought At his departing gaue, and golden mantel brodred faire, And bridle bits with gold (which now my Pallas keepes) a payre. At your request therfore, confedring fast with you I cling. And when the morning next, on earth her light shal rendring bring: With succour home I shal you send, and aid with comfort more. Therewhiles, this offring feast (which to differ were sin to sore) This yerely sacrifice diuine (since here O freendes we bee) With gladnes let performe, and celebrate this day with mee, And your confederates fare accustom now your selfe to byde. Whan he thus said, the deintie meates and cups withdrawen asyde, He bids againe restore, and Troyans set on greene grasse bancke. But chiefe, on beds bespred with Lyons hyde of heare full rancke Aeneas he receiues, and Maple throne to him prefarres. Than all the princely youth, and temple preest from the altar barres Contending bring their meates, entrayles of bulles, and seruice rost, And bread in baskets lade, and wynes they skinke with cakes compost. Aeneas ioyntly fed, the Troian youth also did dyne With tripes of sacred steeres, and total backes of oxen chyne. Whan hungre staunched was, and lust of eating first gan slake, The king Euander sayd: This cheere quod he, that here we make, This offring deintie day, this yerely feast religious pure, This altar great of god, no superstition vayne obscure, Nor errour blinde began (O curteis gest) but cause extreeme, And due deserts of him that vs from daunger did redeeme, Deliuering free from paines, as by good signes thou shalt esteeme. The stori of Hercules and Cacus.Now first behold yon rock, which hang thou seest with threatning sway, Like halfe the mountaine falne, and stones downe wrested shew decay. The bulwarke broken stands, whom rocks and hil down ratling drew. A dongeon caue there was, of widnes wast, most deepe to vew, Which vgly Cacus kept, that halfe was beast, and halfe mankinde, A lothly lurking den, whom beames of sun could neuer finde. Whose floore did alwaies reeke with slaughters new, and euer fresh, His heauie gates were hung, with heads of men, and dropping flesh. Vulcanus to this monster father was, whose flamings blacke He spued at mouth, and where he went al things he threw to wracke. At last also for vs long looking helpe, time comfort brought, And ayde at last we found at god. For after conquest wrought In Spaine, (and Gerion triple bodied kilde) with booties braue, Most mighty Hercules here came, and herds of bulles he draue This way, with steeres right huge of syse, this riuer side they fed. The beasts but setled were, and brooke and vale along they spred: But Cacus fendly sprite that nothing ment but shameles theft, No mischiefe left vntried, no craft vnsought, but all things reft. Foure goodly bodied bolles he from their pasture stealing tooke, And foure of heifers large, and most of beautie faire to looke. And lest perhaps their feete bewray them should by steps of cleaze, He by their tailes them drew al backward plucking from their leaze. Their treadings outward shewd, and euery path did outward guide, And to his caue th? brought, where darke with stone he did th? hide. Wh? men shuld seke, no signe they saw, al tracts were outward tried. This while when Hercules from hence departing would remoue, And gathering tooke his beeues, that ful were fed fro laundes aboue, The cattayle roaring cried, and euery wood with bellowing fild Lamenting thence to mooue, and hils with noyse they left ylwild. One heifer lift her voice, and loude in dongeon sounding shrill She yelling answere gaue, and Cacus hoape dispointed yll. Than verily sir Hercles furious minde for egre paines Did burne with bitter gall, his armour tooles in hands he straines, His heauy club with knobs, and vp that hill he ramps on hie. There Cacus, shrincking furst and furst affrayed, our men did spie, With troubled eies more swifter then than winde he trudging flings, Straight to his caue he flew, feare to his tentoes added wings. Whan he his lodge had lockt, and by his chaines a sunder wrong His huge vnweldy stone downe let, that there for rampier hong With yron and Vulcanes art, his bolts and barrs he fastening ramd, His dongeon mouth he stopt and strong with stuffe he stifly cramd. Behold, furthwith syr Hercles present was with flaming brest, And entries al he vewed, now here now there his eies he kest, For angre gnashing teeth: three times alone in feruent moode, All Auentinus mount he compast round, and thrise he stoode Attempting still those gates, and strong assaulting bounst therat In vaine, and three times in this vale he weery refting sat. A rocke right sharpe of flint there stood, with crags ofcut from sides, Against the dongeons backe vprising hie where clouds deuides. A nestling fortresse fit for birdes of spoyle, and foules vncleane. That rocke where hedlong next the flood it partly low did leane, With shoulders shooning long in vaine he tried, yet adding strength He shogging still did striue, at last it shooke, and quite at length, He lowsened low the rootes, than sodenly where most it swaied, He ouerthrewt that with the throw, hie heauen rebounding braied. The banks w? murmor brake, y? streame ran backward wild affraied. But than the caue and Cacus vgly court disclosed cleere, His hoale, with all his darksom dennes, and kennels close appeere. None otherwise, than if by force whole earth should gaping cliue, Hercules broke vp Cacus den And show the infernall seates, and kingdoms pale reueling riue Most hatefull sight should be: an endles gulfe down reatching deepe, Should fowle apear, and crauling soules at light should quaking creepe. When he with day vnloked for was caught, and shrinking low His deepest den he tooke, nor neuer earst so lowde did blow: Sir Hercles with his tooles on him did prease, and weapons all He fearcely plied both logs of tymbre long, and milstones tall. He grunting foule at mouth (for hope was none to scape by flight) A cloud of stifling stinking smoke (a wondrous thing to sight) He from his iawes outspued, that all the vaut with darknes stuft, Depriuing eies from sight, and through the dongeon thicke he puft His fumes as blacke as night, and mixt with mist he perbrakt fier. That thing sir Hercles wold not bide, but hedlong down for yre, Euen through y? flames he lept, where smolthring stremes did most redound Of smoke, and where most boiling breth did caue most darke confound. There Cacus black in cloud, and belching fearce his burnings vaine Cacus slaine.He groping straitly gript, and round in knot he wound in twaine. Then crushing necke and eyes, his thirstie throte of blood did choke. Anone the gastly den wide ope is set with gates vpbroke, The cattel furth are fet, then pyles of pelfe and robbery spoyles To heauen are shewd, his carcas eke misshapen vile of foyles, Is by the legs outdrawen, mens harts in looking take no rest. His grisly squeased eien, his lothly face, his bristled brest, His mongrell members rough, his quenched fier in iawes opprest. From that time furth this honor grew, y? youth with gladsome game, This holy day do keepe, Potitius first began the same, And great Pinarias house, that Hercles offring euer serues From yere to yere, and for his worship more that thus deserues This groue and altar set, which euermore the chiefest shall Be cald of vs, and shall in deede be euer chiefe of all. Wherfore come of, O youth, and for the praise of so great gift With braunches binde your heads, and cups in quaffing loke you lift And call our general God, and skinke furth wines with glad good wils. He said, th? twisting Poppler braunch, his crowne with leaues he hils. With Hercles Poppler leaues (all dooble huid) his temples tide, And sacred boll with wine in hand he gripte, then side by side All men with feasting dranke, and bords they lade, and gods did pray. The sun this while from skies did neere to night discending sway. And now the seruice priests, and furst Potitius led their bands, Of custome great in skinnes, and torches burning bare in hands. Their banquets they renew, and ionkets courses after meates. Their presents hie they heape, that euery boord with bourden sweates. Than singing measure layes, at the altars burning daunsing round, The skipping Salij were come, with poppler braunches bound, In raye men set them selues, the yong men here, the old men there, Hercules prayses.That Hercles praises great, and doughty deedes to heauen may beare. How first he tender childe his stepdames monsters kild with ease By hand, and serpents twaine to death he wringing flat did squease. How stoutfull he by war did cities downe destroy full strong, Both Troia, Oechalia with more, how thousand labours long At king Euristeus request, by Iunos deepe despite, He ouercame and bare, thou lord vnuicted most of might, Thou slewest the mongrell beast, misshapen Centaures gotten of cloud. Both Hileus, and Pholus foule, thou Creslies monsters proud Didst kill with hand, and Lion bolde in Nemec rocke didst quell. At thee did Lymbo quake, to thee the Porter huge of hell, To thee he trembling shooke, and left his bones begonne vngnawn, He left his murthering caue, by thee from thence he was furth drawn. Nor was there neuer face that euer could thee make affrayde. No not him selfe Typhœus, in burning armour vgly rayde With hundred hands that fought, nor thee that time thy reason failde Whan Lerna dragon thee with heapes of heads all round assailde. Alhayle vndoubted childe of god, new ioy to saincts aboue, Come visit vs with grace, and these thy gifts accept and loue. Such things in hymnes they sang, but ouer all of Cacus hoale They mencion make, and of him selfe with breath as burning coale. The woods with song resounds, and hils with carols aunsweres yeelde. Than euery man whan seruice all deuine was first fulfilde, Unto the towne them drew, the king him self of stouping age, Aeneas next him toke for mate, his sonne him led as page, With sundry speech of things to ease their way the time they past. Aeneas wondring much on euery side his eyes did cast, With euery place in minde he rauisht was, and oft enqueres Eche thing, and monuments he gladly learnes of elder yeres. Than king Euander spake, that first the towres of Rome did found. The woods (quoth he) somtime both Fauns, &amp; Nimphs, &amp; gods of ground, And fairy Queenes did keepe, and vnder them a nacion rough, A people saluage strong, and borne in troncks of timber tough: Who neither nurture knew, nor trade of life, nor bullocks taught, Nor goods vpstore they could, nor wisely spare those things thei caught. But bowes of trees them fed, and hunting hard them kept from cold. Furst from Olympus mount (right neare the skies) good Saturn old, Whan hee from Ioue did flee, and from his kingdoms outlawd stood, Hee first that wayward skittish kinde disperst in hilles, and wood, Did bring to thrift, and gaue them lawes, and all the land this way Did Latium call, for saufly here long time he lurking lay. Latium way so called. And vnder that good king men say, the golden world did dure, Such pleasaunt peace he taught, and peoples kept in iustice pure: Till worser age at last, of baser sort by small and small, With mad desier of wars, and loue to haue, corrupted all. Than came Ausonia strength, than Sicil folkes and countreys straunge, And oftentimes her name, Saturnus land was driuen to chaunge. Than kings, and chiefly Tyber great with body burly tall, By whose surname Italia folks this flood did Tiber call, (For Albula the former name it lost forgotten quite.) My selfe expulst from out my countrey land by wrongful might, And folowing long the seas, with course extreame as cause did shape Almighty fortunes lucke, and destny strong whom none can skape, Haue planted in this place, and here my mother did mee chase Carmenta prophet Nimph, by dredefull songs of Phœbus grace. Skant this he said: and walking furth her altar huge of state He shewd, and Carmentalis cald by Romain name the gate, Which builded was, men say, for dame Carmentas mencion deere, That prophet destnie speaker, furst that sang in dities cleere Of great Aeneas lyne, and Pallantee that noble fort. From thence the shirwood great, where saulf defence, and free resort, Duke Romulus vptooke, and in the rocke full cold outhewd Lupercal temple close, and mistryes all therof he shewd. He shewd also the sacred groue of Argilethus heath, Detesting in that place where Greekish gest was done to death. From thence to Tarpey seat, and Capitoll he furth him led All gilded now, but than with briers and brambles thicke bespred. Euen very than, religious feare the plowmens harts did shake, Euen than, that dredfull rocke &amp; groue for reuerence did them quake. This groue (quoth he) thou seest, this bushie hil so slope that clymes (Unknowen it is what god,) here dwels a god, full often tymes Arcadia men beleeue there Ioue they saw, whan darcksome blacke His fearful shield he shooke, &amp; thundring stormes there made to cracke. These boroughs twaine besides with walles downe cast decayed y? bee (Their ruines lo thou mayst, and monuments of old men, see) This Ianus auncient built, that other towne Saturnus wald, Ianiculum this was, that other than Saturnia cald. Such talk between themselues they had, and now they entring drew To poore Euanders house, and herds of beasts ful thick they vew And bellowings loud they heare, where now the shambles fat of Rome Are kept, and where the markets stands, and Iudges sit in dome. Whan to the court they came: This gate (? he) this threshold small Hath Hercules gon through, here he was lodged in this hall. Be bold good gest, and learn to shake of pompe, and worthy deeme Thy self by God, and with good wil our welcome poore esteeme. He said, and to his simple hall be brought full voyd of feare Aeneas mighty prince, and him on bed he setled theare, On mattresse stuft with leaues, and laid with hide of boystous beare. The night down fals, &amp; blacke w? winges embrasing hides the ground. But Venus as a mother, whom great carks did much confound Of Laurent threatning lords, these tumults hard in brest she rolde. Venus spake to Vulcane. To Vulcan than he spake, and in her husbandes bed of golde She thus began, and loue deuine enspiring thus him tolde. Such time as Greekish kings did Troian walles with fire deface Well worthy th? to fal, and towres with warres did quite downe race, I neuer help to them (poore soules) nor armour yet requierd, Of thy relief or craft, (o husbande sweeteloue most desierd) Nor thee (deere hart) could I permit that time thy selfe to straine, Nor see thy labours lost, or cunning works to wast in vaine, Though I to Priamus sonnes for great deserts good will did beare, And for Aeneas labours hard I wept haue many a teare. Now he in Rutil Realmes by Ioues commandment setled stands. Most lowly now therefore to thee I sue, and at thy handes Enforced craue relief, O sacred spouse most vndefilde: A mothers part I worke, I aske but harneis for my childe. Dame Thetis for her sonne did like request obtaine er now Of thee, so could Aurora cleare thy minde with weepings bow. Beholde what nations ioine, what cities wald with gates vpshut Do whet their fighting tooles, that me and mine to wracke would put. She said, and with her armes as white as snow his necke she heelde, Him softly colling sweet, with tender toyes: he loth to yeelde, At last conceiued flame, and sodenly the acquainted heate Outran through al his bones, and mary tickling moist did sweate, In maner like, as through some thundring cloude with r?bling ript, The lightning shining shoots, and fire at clift outsprings vntript. She felt her beautie work, and false her hart for gladnesse skipt. Then father Vulcan spake, constraind with loues eternal lust. What needs this circumstaunce far fet? where is thy stedfast trust Vulcanus answer to Venus. O lady, fled from me? If I had knowne thou hadst thus caard, Defence for Troian walles we might that time haue wel prepaard. For neither God almighty, neither destnies were so sore, But Troy mought stil haue stand, and Priam liue yet ten yeare more. And now, if warre thou wilt, and therevpon thy mind is bent, What euer I with craft or cunning casting may inuent, What can be wrought in steele, or siluer pliant mixt with brasse, Looke what the fier, or breathing blastes may make (let praying passe) Of mee, and all my strength assure thy selfe, be bolde of this, What euer lieth in mee, vndoubtedly, thine owne it is. These words he spake, &amp; close imbracinge sweete his spouse he clipt, And gaue desiers of ioy, with lap to lap relenting dipt, Resoluing limmes at rest, and sences deepe in slomber slipt. Than first whan midnight course w? race outrun, him brake fr? sleepe, As doth some wedlocke wife, some thriuing dame y? house doth keepe, Who life by labour seekes, and distaf worke doth weaue and spin, Her couched harth she steeres, and sturging sparke of fire doth tin, Encroching worke by night, and hard with taske her maydens all By candels early plies, wherby she may her children small Bring vp, and chaste her self mainteyne, and husband helpe withall. In likely sort this firie puissant god, nor slacker wise From bed full soft that time, to smithie works did earnest rise. An Yle there is, by Sicill side vplifted large in skies, Cald Liparen where smoke from stones to starres vpsteaming sties. There vnder creepes a caue, and Ciclops chimne is gnawne in rockes, Through Ætnas thundring dens, of smiting strokes &amp; bounsing knockes That wailes, w? sighing sounds, such battring beating through y? chinks Far rendring aunswers ring, and yngot gads with clashing clincks, In blustring forges blowne, where dints replied with peyse, and pithes Done metals dinging driue, and sturdy steele they stretch on stithes. Vulcania, Vulcanus house it is, and Vulcans name that land doth here. The firy puissaunt god that time from heauen descended there, The gyantes in that caue of wydnesse wast their tooles did plie, Pyragmon nakedlimd, and Steropes, and Brontes hie. A worke in hand they had vnfashiond yet, but part made bright One thundring burnisht bolt, w? many a such from heauen doth smight. Whan Ioue to ground them throwes, but part vnperfit did remaine. Then store of strugling windes, &amp; stormfull cloudes of clodded raine. Three winterwrested showres, three firyforked flashing beames. Three ratling tempest bals, three southwind winged lightning leames. Now glistring blasing lights, now gastly sights mens harts to skeare, In forging fire they shope, w? thump thump sound both noise, &amp; feare, They mingled through their worke, &amp; wrangled wrathes of following flame. Another sort for Mars a charet swift with wheeles did frame, A charet wyld wherby the god vpsteeres both campes and townes. A sheeld for Pallas eke, in troublous feelds full grim that frownes All horrible, with serpent skales beset, and fine with gold Were dragons drawen in wrethes, and poolisht pure in plated fold, And monster Gorgons head (with necke ofchopt) amid her brest They put, that men to stones may turne with eies to death comprest. Set set aside all things, cast of (? he) your workes begon, You Ætna lads, let studies all to this one charge now ron. An egre man must valiaunt armour weare, now show your speede, Now shifting hands requiers, now maisters all of craft is neede, Breake hedlong al delayes: nor more he spake. They swiftly than Besturring striue to stoupe, and by their lots to labour ran. Outgushing flowes in streames both gold, and brasse, and siluer swelts, And lumps of murthring steele, in furnies glowing softning melts. A huge hie sheeld they shape, one sheeld alone for weapons all Of Latines, and against all foes and force resist that shall, Emboasid brode with hoopes, whom bars in bars entangling bindes Seuenfolded thick. Som thrusting furth fr? bellowes blasting windes Incessaunt yeld and draw, some dips in lakes and troughes of stones Hoat hissing gleads: All Ætna vauts with anuilds mourning grones. They still among themselues their armes in course by force vp lift With n?brings iump, &amp; grasping tough in tongs their masse they shift. While these things hasting were by Vulcan lord in Lemnos lande, Euander king from bed, the dawning day bad vp to stande, And early songs of birds his roof that fild with mirthfull note. He riseth aged man, and on his limmes he puts his coate, And thongs in Tyrrhen guise about his feete he wrapt and tyde. Then sword with girdle strong from shoulders down he next his side Did girt, and baldrick wise his wreath he ware of Panthers hyde. Two waiting dogs also that thentrie doore at threshold kept Came furth, and matching foote by foote their maisters pace they stept. Unto his gest Aeneas chambre straight, he softly drewe, Remembring former talke, he of his word a lord full true. Nor morning styrer lesse, Aeneas then abroad was stalkt. Son Pallas with Euander, but with him Achates walkt. They meeting ioyne right hands, and in the mids of hall downe set, In speeche at last they fall, of causes vrgent free from let. The king thus furst. Most doughtie Troian guide (which while thou art aliue in helth I neuer Troy destroyed shal thinke, nor vanquisht voyd of welth) To such a carefull war, and for the fame of thy regard Small succour we can geue, here Tyber streame vplocks vs hard. On this side Rutils wring, and at our walls their harneis sounds. But peoples huge to thee, and kingdoms rich of larger bounds I go about to ioyne, whom very now euen chaunce vnsought Doth show to thee, euen destnies lucke this time thee here hath brought. Not far from hence a towne there is, with auncient stones vpfraamd, Which Agillina hight, where people somtime Lydia naamd, A nacion strong in war Etruria downes possesse and till. This land that many a yere did flowing raign with welth at will, A proude king caught at last, and long by force with armes opprest, The crueltie of Mezentius Mezentius lawles wretch, whose moode misecreaunt neuer ceast. What shall I tell the furious slaughters foule? to shame to speake That tyrants odious deeds? god on his head and seede so wreake. Mens bodies dead he did deuise to ioyne to bodies quicke In tortures, hands to hands, &amp; mouthes to mouthes them binding thick. (O plague most miserous) and them through filth, and rotting cloied In wretched claspings vile, with lingring death most lothly stroied. But weery long at last, when he more mad would worse haue wrought, His subiects weaponed rose, and him in house beseiging sought. His mates they slew, and to his rafter tops their fier they flang. He through their slaughter throngs to Rutil realme outskaping sprang. Where with his hoast and mate king Turnus fearce him selfe he fends, With iust reuenge therfore Etruria land al whole ascends, Their king by war they clayme, and him by death they minde to quit. These milions strong of men I will to thee Aeneas knit. Their nauy furnisht full already thicke at shore remaines, And streamers out they crie, an auncient prophet them restraines By destny singing. O you chosen youth of liuely lust, You flowre of former yeres, you strength of men, whom anger iust Prouokes to vengeaunce due, whose wrath Mezentius doth deserue, No prince Italian borne may for this armie captaine serue, Seeke alien lords for guides. Than all Etruria sore affright Did setling stay them selues, and in that field their campe haue pight. Him self embassadours to mee with crowne, and scepter sent Duke Tarchon, and with kingly robes mee here he did present. But vew the campe I should, and Tyrrhen kingdoms al possesse. But mee my slouthfull colde, and worlds outworn in yeres excesse, Enuies me now to raigne, and feeble strength to late to steere. My son I would exhort, saue he by mother mixed neere Of dame Sabella part that countrey drawes. But thou whose yeres, And kinred fortune loues, whom destnies lucke and goods requeres, Go thou O Troian, and Italian prince, most strong of might. Besides all this I shall, our onely hope and deere delight My son sir Pallas here to thee commit, that vnder thee Pallas committed to Aeneas. He may the feates of war as with a maister learne, and see Most weightie works of Mars, that from his youth thy worthy deedes He wondring may conceiue, and practise like if chaunce him needes. Two hundred horsmen strong of freshest youth take here in hand, So many more also shal Pallas bring of priuat band. These words he scantly spake, and fired fast with eyes on ground Aeneas sadly sat, so did Achates freend most sound. Much heauie things in hart they through their brests considring waied. Had Venus not from heauen by signe downe sent their musing staied. For sodenly with whirling noise the skies broad open flusht, And lightning whistling came, as round about all things had rusht, And blast of trompet blown in welkin brim was heard to roare. They looke: lo yet againe, and yet, two, three, great thundrings more Bright armour through the clouds in coast of heauen most cleere of sun Readshining rough they see, that back repulsing rombling run. All other stood astoind, but he him selfe most valiaunt knight Aeneas, knew that noyse, and what his mother him had hight. Than thus he spake. Be you good hoast, be you no whit appald, What newes these monsters meane, tis I aloft in skies am cald. This token me from heauen my mother said she would downe send, If warres should roughly rise, and Vulcans armes me to defend She brings me through the clouds. Alas, what slaughters wilde on wretched Laurents hang at hand? What turments thee (O Turnus) must I giue? how mixt in sand Both shields and helms of men, with many a body strong and tall O Tyber flood with waters troul thou shalt? and many a fall In fight susteine they must, wh? truce they aske yet breake they shal. These things when he had said, him self vplifting hie from benche, To Hercles altars first and sleeping fiers whom night did quenche He went them to reuiue, and seruice left since yersterday He gladly vprestores, and houshold gods they please and pray, Both king Euander self, and Troian youth with whole assent. Than to his ships furthwith, to visit there his mates he went. Among which number such as him to warfare should pursue Most hardy practiue knights he chose, the remnant downward drue. The groueling streme them beares, &amp; swift they home by water dresse To bring Ascanius newes, both of his father, and successe. To Troians than are horses geuen, to passe to Tirrhen towne, A royall courser for Aeneas, whom of Lion browne One hyde al ouerspreds with guilded clawes bright pendant downe. The rumour runnes, and through that citie small is blasid wide, How horsemen vnto Tirrhen coast with swift course posting ride. For dreed mens wiues with vowes do lade their gods, &amp; more and more Men dangers cast, and face of Mars appeares not seene so sore. Than good Euander olde, Aeneas righthand clipping hyld, And thus at parting spake, and weeping still could not be fyld. O if almighty god would mee my yeres of youth restore Euen as I was, whan at Præneste walles (my troupes before) I fought, when heapes of conquerd sheelds I victor offring brent, And with this right hand than, king Herilus to hell I sent, Whose mother at his birth him gaue three liues in limmes to lag, (A grisly thing to speake) three weapons he by course did wag, Three times to death he must down vanquisht be, yet breathings all This righthand him bereft, and soules, and armour thrise made fall. Not now deere son, from thine embrasings sweete should I be pluckt, O dulcet son: nor so Mezentius borderer, blood had suckt Dispiting still my head, such murthering deathes had not ben seene, Nor such asort of burgeis wiues should widowes now haue beene. But O you glorious gods, thou chiefe in heauen that raignst on hie The pattern of a kind and louing father.Most mighty Ioue, of poore Arcadia king respect the crie, Giue gracious eare this time, and to my prayers piteous bend. If destnies mee by your good grace my son home saufly send, If looking him I liue, and wee in one may meete againe: Than craue I longer life, and glad I shal receaue all paine. But if (as god forefend) some sore mischaunce doth fortune threat, Now new let mee depart, and cruel life ofcasting freat, While doubtful carck me keepes, while hope in minde vncertein is, While thee my derling childe, mine onely ioy my parting blis, Thus haulsing here I hold, ere tidings worse mine eares may wound. These things his father shed at leauing last, and flat in sound With sobbing fainting fell: his pages him to house conueyed. And now the horsmen band at open gates went out vnstayed. Aeneas with the first, Achates trustie next his side. Than other Troyan lords, him self in mids did Pallas ride In glistring painted armes, and gay with cloke embroidred newe, Like Lucifer that gracious dawning star, whom pure of hue Dame Venus chiefly loues aboue all fiers in heauen that shine, All darknes he resolues, and gladneth skies with face deuine. The women stand on walles with trembling harts, and far with eyes Pursue their glittering harneis troupes, and cloudes of dust that rise. They through the thornie downs wher nerest way no compas makes In armour ioyntly ryde, hie shoutes vprise, and clustring strakes. They gallup, &amp; vnder their trampling feete the ground with breaking quakes. There is a groue of greenewood frith, by Cerits riuer cold, Religious, long and broad in reuerence kept by fathers old, Whom caues of crooked hils with dales and downs that compas sets On euery side doth close, and woods of firtree blacke besets. To Siluan god of beasts and fields that auncient Greekes men say Did consecrate that place, and gaue both groue and feastfull day, Which Greekes somtime possest of Latium countrey first the lands. Not far from thence duke Tarchons host, and all Ætruria bands Incamped saufly lay, and from the hill their legions strong All plaine might now be vewed, that broad in fields outstretched long. Aeneas to that place, and warlike youth, in minde wel pleasd Alighting, wery went, and horses trymd, and bodies easd. But goddesse Venus white, from through the cloudes descending clere Was ready there with gifts, and to her sonne approching nere, Whan secret him she saw, far from the flood in crooked vale She offring shewed her selfe, and thus she shortly brake her tale. Lo here my husbands worke, my promise due, cast of thy doubt O son, nor feare not now to coape with all proud Laurents rout, And Turnus now to combat call, though he be ner so stout. She said, and of her son th'embrasing sweete furthwith she fet. Than vnderneath an oke in sight, those glistring armes she set, He gladfull of those gifts, with minde for ioyes in myrth extolde With sight could not be fild, but eies on eche thing stil he rolde. He wondreth, and betweene his armes, and handes he oft vpturnes A helme most horrible, with crests, out spitting flames that burnes. A murthring fatall blade, a brestplate stif of bras most fine, All bloodread, sanguine, byg, like many times whan sun doth shine, Some blue cloud catcheth beames, &amp; burning bright with ruddy rayes A loofe it selfe it shewes, and streaming light likewise displayes. Then bootes of siluer light enameld gorgeous mixt with gold. The famous deedes of Romanes, were engrauen in y? armour of Aeneas.A speare also with sheeld, whose wondrous worke can not be told. There all Italia state, and peereles Rome with triumphes all (Not ignoraunt of age to come, and destnies that should fall) The firie puissaunt god had made: there all Ascanius race In order faire was wrought, and foughten fields in euery place. He there also had put, where greene the caue of Mars begins A she wolfe downe was layed, and next her dugs two goodly twins, Two daggling sucking boies, her flanks betweene they hanging plaide, Their mammies teats they lap with hungry lips nothing affraide. She turning round her neck, now one, now one, them sweetely lickt Reforming soft their limmes, &amp; soft with tong them smoothly strickt. Nor far from thence was Rome, and Sabines virgins rashly raught At sight of stately playes, and thence by force for wedlocks caught, The story all there stood, and sodenly new war did rise To Romulus and Tatius old, and lords of Sabines wise. Within a while those kings (their all contencions quenched quite) Before Ioues altar came, and holding bolles in armour bright They stood, and with a swine downe slaine did leag conclud &amp; smite. Not far from thence was Metius torne, in quarters pluckt by steeds, But why thou Alban to thy words accorded not thy deeds? And of that lying lord did Tullus drag those false entrailes Euen through the wood, that thornes &amp; briers with blood besprinckling, hailes. Than king Porsenna strong commaunded Romains eft restore Their Tarquin outlawd king, and long be seiging wrang them sore. Aeneas people fearce for freedom fast on weapons ran, Him angrie, threatning like, you mought see chaafe disdaining than, That Cocles durst resist while bridge behind him broken was, And Clœlia captiue wench with broken bands the streame did pas. Upon the Tarpey rocke, and Capitoll most lordly braue, Stood Manlius that champion chiefe, his countrey wals to saue. He for the temple fought, and enemies clambring downe did pull With stubble starke of steele, the Pallas court of Rome was full. And flickring there in golde, the siluer Gander keakyng cried At hand, and in the Porches next the Frenchmen entring spied. The Frenchmen entring were, and taking Towres did fearce inuade, By bushes climing close, and kept with helpe of darke night shade. Of Gold their Tresses were, their golden garments trim them decks, In garded frocks they shine with roddid welts about their necks, In partles knit with Golde, two slinging speares eche one doth lift, In Mountaine guise, and shields of length defend theyr bodies swift. Than came the skipping sort, in daunce disguised shaking shanks, The Salij praunsing Priests, with mitred crownes, and coppid tancks. The Luperts naked went, and armour holy liften aloft, That downe from heauen did fall, the matrones chast in Charets soft Religious led their gods, and through the towne procession brought. Along way far from thence, the dennes of Hel most deepe wer wrought, And louring Limbo gates, with sundry sinfull wretches pangs. Thou Catilin wert there, on threatning rocke thy carcas hangs, Thy turments there thou bidest, and still doost feare those fendly iawes. But good men by them selues, and Cato them did giue their lawes. Among all this there went the salt sea broad with swelling broth Of Gold, but greene the frisking floods did fome with hoary froth. And cut in siluer cleere the Dolphins swimming compas daunst, The streams w? tailes they swept, &amp; through y? tides they sher?g gla?st. In mids were brasen fleetes of ships, and Actia wars at large Men might haue seene, how battels both conioyning bent their charge. The seas with harnies shines that boyling floods with gold did spring. There all Italia strength Augustus Emprour prince did bring, Augustus Cæsar. With commons all, with lords, w? saints, w? gods most great of might, Aduauncing cheif in ship, whose temples twaine with flames vpright Outsparkling spoutes a fier, his fathers siar his crowne bespreds. Another wing with prosperous windes, and Gods in army ledes Agrippa lofty prince, whose pendant streamers proud stands out, His crowne couragious shines with garlond wun from topshipsnout, On th'other part with all Barbaria force of diuerse armes Anthonius drags his traine of nacions thick, in throngs that swarmes, He victour late in wars, from countries far where Sun doth rise, From peoples blacke of Inde, from red sea shore, from eastern skies, All Ægipt and all Asia strength extreme with him he drew, Cleopatra concubine to Anthony.Whom proudly (fie for shame) his Gyptian wife doth next persue. Togither all they rusht, and pluckt with ores conflicting clasht, The waues w? wrastling fumes, &amp; fr?ts to fr?ts their ships they crasht. To chanell deepe they draw, a man would thinke y? mountaynes meete In seas, or iustling woods with woods hole rocks, and Ilandes fleete. So huge w? weight m? work: fr? towres, &amp; tops their darts down strikes Their wildfire Okam flies, &amp; stormes out thrown of tooles with pikes. The clouds with cries are mixt, both ships &amp; seas with slaughters spred, All Neptunes flittryng feelds with bloudshed stremes are darkned red. The Queene in mids them al with timbrell noyse her bands vpcheeres, Nor yet two deadly serpent snakes, to her at backe appeeres, All monstrous kinded gods, Anubys dog that barking slaue, Against all Romain guids (both Venus, Neptune, Pallas graue) Their weapons vp they holde, outragious Mars among them stamps, All cut in carued steele, and hags infernall fearcely ramps. Dame Discord through th? runs, with garments torne the ioyful skips, Whom grim Bellona mad pursues at hand with blooddy whips. These things beholding thus, Apollo shooting plied his bowe, Aloft from skies, all Ægypt than, all Inde downe couched lowe, All nations wilde of South Arabia proude for all their cracks, All Asia scattring fled, all Sabey kingdoms turnd their backs. The Queene her self was seene with winds aduaunst vplifting sayles To flee, and still with slacking shrowds she more and more preuayles. Among those slaughters, her (for death at hand) w? countenance pale, The firie god hath made be borne with waues, and westerne gale. But there against with body great, was Nylus mourning put, His bosom opening broad, and calling home their course to cut. His garment gowne he spred, and wide his lap of waters blue, And to his lurking floods his conquerd men alluring drew. But Cæsar through the Romain wals three times triumphant borne To great Italia gods he payed his vowes eternall sworne. Three hundred Churches Mynsters chiefe along the towne wide open stands, All streets with mirth reso?ds, with games, w? sports, w? clapping h?ds In euery temple wiues, at euery altar singing queeres, At the altars, euery floore with offring slaughters strowd of steeres. Himself at Phœbus porch (so white as snow) in throne downe set, Surueys al countreys gifts, and garnisht posts with present frets, In long arayes they gon, the conquerd nacions captiue sad, As diuerse of their tongs as in their weedes and armours clad. Three sundry sorts of Moores had Vulcan cast, some tuckt in shyrts, Some trayling mantels loose, or sirpleys windie wide of skyrts: Of Cara, Lelega, by south, and archers bred in caues Of Gelon sands, Euphrates now did fleete with softer waues. And Flemings furthest out from men, and Rhyne with hornes in twaine, Unconquerd Danes, and flood Araxes (bridge that did disdaine.) Such works in Venus gift he wondring saw by Vulcans sheeld, And knowing not the things, their figures glad he long beheeld. At last, his childrens chaunce, and fame he did on shoulders weeld. DEO GRATIAS. Per Thomam Phaer, in foresta Kilgerran x. Septembris. finitum. 1558. Opus xl. dierum per interualla. THE NINTH BOOKE of the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. Whilst Aeneas is busie in Tuscia to seke aid, Turnus is by the Raynbow admonished not to omit so good an occasion, who speadeth him self forth as neare as he can to his enemies. And seeing them defensed on euery side in their tentes, to the intent that he might cut away from them all hope of flight, assaieth to burne their fleete. But at Venus ernest sute: Iupiter deliuered the ships from present burnings, and transformed them into so many Nymphes of the sea. Towards night, Turnus sayeth a watch before the towne gates for feare of soddein eruptions of the enemy, in which watch Messapus is chiefe. Therwhiles the Troians take take counsel whom to s?d to Aeneas to make him priuy of these things, which Nysus &amp; Euryalus, a paier of faithful freends take in hand to do. Who departing forth of the towne, &amp; finding the watch ouercome with wine &amp; sleape: they sley Rhamnetes with a numbre of Rutilians, &amp; lade them selues with the spoyles. But in the morning, being spied of Volscens horsemen: they flie to the woods. There Eurialus by weight of his armor, and ignorance of the way much hindred, falleth into his foes handes &amp; is by Volscens slayne. Nisus likewise, when he had slayne Volscens, and valiantly reuenged Eurialus death beeing strooke through with many a mortall wound falleth downe dead vpon his freends body. Their heads are caried vpon speares pointes into the tentes, where the Troians knowing them from the walles, a great sorow riseth through the whole towne. Turnus ceaseth not to assault his enemies with al force, and great slaughter is committed on both parts. There Ascanius killeth with the shoot of an arow Numanus, that ouer proudly aduanced himself: Pandarus &amp; Bitias proud of their good successe, open the gate, and driue backe the enemies entring in with great slaughter. Whereof Turnus being certefied: issueth into the towne through the open gate, and putteth the Troians to flight, but at length oppressed with multitude, retyreth to the side of the towne which is next the riuer, &amp; armed as he was, leapeth into the streame, and so escapeth. Iuno pricketh forth Turnus by the Raynbow While these things working were, on sundry sides with purpose bent, Dame Iuno downe from heauen the Rainebow red her seruaunt sent To Turnus dredeles prince, King Turnus than did seat depose In great Pylumnus vale, his parents woods whom round did close. To whom dame Rainbow thus, with mouth bespake as red as rose. Turnus (? she) that thing which neuer god if one had sought Could graunt to thee: lo, tumbling time alone it self hath brought. Aeneas now from home to king Euanders house is gone, And left both campe &amp; mates, and town, and fleete with sauegard none. The fines extreme of Corytes townes he seekes, nor yet ynough, But Lydas power he drawes, and armour giues to men from plough. Leaue doubting, take thy time, call charets out, now set furth steeds, Breake boldly all delayes, go take that campe that al thing dreeds. She said, and lifting equall wings to heauen she mounted slowe, And huge in flight she spred, and vnder clouds, cut of her bowe. The yong prince her beknew, and holding hands to skies on hie He wondring her pursued, and as she fled he thus did crie. O Rainbow beautie bright of heauen, who through the clouds this tide, Hath drawne thee thus to ground? I see, I see, whole heauen deuide. I see the stragling stars, that from the poale their course declines, Such clearbright storme? I folow fast all these miraclose signes What euer thou art that mee to armour calst, and with that word Went foorth, and from the swelling streame, he water sipt at ford Requiring much his gods, and aire did lade with vowes outpowrd. And now the totall hoast in fields displaied their pace did hold, Right rich of hors, right rich of broydrid robes, and braue of gold. Messapus voward held, the rerward kept yong princes twaine Of Tirrhus, but him self king Turnus midst in battaile maine, Uauntsquaring spreds his armes, and ouer all by shoulders shines. Resembling Ganges flood that ouerflowes seuen streames, and fines In silence burbling broad, or Nylus fresh with waters fat Whan couching close he swels, and seasoneth fields with fleeting flat. There sodainly a darksom dusky fog most like a cloud The Troians might behold, y? round with rolles the skies did shroud. Furst from a banke on hie did Caycus watchman crye aloud. What is yon blacke, O mates? that like a bowle such dust vp skralls? Set swiftly furth your tooles, bring weapons out, and clym your walls. Here is our enmy lo, heylagh, loud clamours than they throw. The Troyans all about at gates and wals, them close bestow. For such commaundment them Aeneas best of martiall skill At his departing gaue, if any chaunce should rise them yll, Not rashly ioyne they should, nor trusting field their strength extend, But closely kepe their campe, and saulf their wals with bancks defend. Though shame therfore w? wrath prouokes to fight disdainful deepe, Yet gates to them they set, and due precepts obedient keepe, And harneyst hie they stand, forstalling foes on rampiers steepe. Turnus (as he before the people slow, in post did flye) With twenty chosen knights, on horsback stout the fortresse nye, All sodenly vnlooked for is come, whom white with speckes A Thracian steede vpheaues, and helmet red gold crested deckes. Is any here good lads, wil furst with mee prouoke our foes? And to the winds a dart he whirling shooke: lo, there it goes Quod he, this fight begins, and boystous large on field he flyes, His mates with noyse pursuen, with grisly shouts vplifting cries. They wondren at the Troyans dastard harts, their corage weake, That neither geue them dare in open field, nor fearce outbreake In armes as men, but faintly kepe their fort, now here, now there He troublous vewes their wals, and ryding seekes ech entring where. The noble valur of TurnusAye watching like some Wolfe, that counterwaiting shipfold cots, Through stormy showres and winds about mens deiries houling trots At midnight seeking stealth, whan careles loud the lambes do bleat In saulfgard nere their dammes, he fretting false and mad for meat Doth absent teare their lims, so gripes his guts that gathring gnawes, Long fasting furth him driues, and thyrst of blood vpdries his iawes. Euen so to Rutile prince, as serching wals and campe he turnes, His fumes vpsparkling spreds, and sore in bones his grief him burnes. What shift inuent he shal to giue thassault, or where finde place To breake the Troians trench, or driue them down to equall space. Their fleete that secret lay, euen at the side of Troian wall, Enuironed with trench, whom water floods encompast all He sodenly onsets, and to his mates for fire exclames. Him self outcasting flings his pynetree bronds with feruent flames. Than echman stoutly sturs, the kings owne presence men furth pricks. On euery side fresh youth for armour takes blacke burning sticks. They sparpling spoile their fiers. Than blasing cloud with pitch c?mixt Doth rise, and smoke from torches mount, to stars with sparks betwixt. Now Muses tell what god did from the Troyans turne this yre So great, and who then kept their fleete from fumes of fatall fyre? Speake trusting old report, but fame therof shal neuer expyre. What time Aeneas prince in Ida woods his nauie made A fable of Aeneas ships. At passing first from Troy, and through deepe seas should take his trade: The mother of gods men say, that Berecinthia heauenly hight, Peticion that time made to Ioue celestiall great of might Entreating thus by speech. Giue son (? she) to thy deare dame, One boone which I must aske, since heauens to thee bin brought so tame. A Pynetree frith I had, which many a yere I fauoured much, And in the top a groue there grew of trees, there was none such For beames of timbre blacke, and firtree bourds with pitch and tar. Great offrings there I tooke, and folks to serue me came from far. Those trees to Troian prince, whan he so much of ships had need I gaue with glad good will, now care my hart doth gripe for dreed. Releas my fear, let now thy parents words thus much obtaine. Let neuer surge of seas, nor whirlwind storme their nauie straine, Nor course of sayling shake, since on my hilles somtime they grew. Her son to her than spake, whose wind doth stars and world subdue. O mother what thing meanst? or which way destnies wouldst y? presse? Can frames of mortall hands immortall state by right possesse? Or should Aeneas prince in doubtfull daungers wandring stray? That certein is of seate? what god so great such maistries may? Nay whan fulfild they haue their fatall course, that ports, and realmes Of Latium lands they touch, what ship somtime so skapes the streames, Their mortall shape from them I will withdraw, and chaunge them all To maidens bright of seas, like water Nimphes with bodies tall. Lyke Clotho goddesse clere, or Galatee with membres white, Who through their foming waues with persaunt brest doth swimming smite. He spake, and by the fens of Stigies flood his oth he tooke, By pitch of Lymbo pits, by gulfe and banks of Plutos brooke. He gaue a nod, and at his becke, whole heauen trembling shooke. The day therfore of couenaunt present was, and destnies dew Performed had their time, whan Turnus fearce with dredfull vew, Compeld that lady sainct from sacred ships that fire to driue. There furst a sodain light before mens eyes did straunge ariue, And huge from morning skies descending cloud down gliding ran, With queeres of sprituall wights, than dredfull voice wide aire beg? To fill in Rutiles eares, and troupes of Troians brim to skan. Do not affright your selues to saue my ships with labour vaine, You Troyans, nor in armour put your strength, nor take that paine. For furst shal Turnus waters all consume, and burne vp seas Ere hee my sacred trees haue power to touch, go loose at ease, Go saltsea goddesses, your lady bids, and as it spake, Incontinent ech ship their bands at shore, and halsers brake, Aeneas shippes transformed into Nimphes of y? seas.And down (as dolphins don) conuerting sharp their beaking snoutes, In deepe sea sands they drown, whence vp furth w? they ryse by routes. A maruell monstrous much, in virgin shapes and faces trym On seas them selues they shoue, and sporting swift in sight they swym, Like Mermaides ladies light, of number iust, and not one more As they before did stand, with brasen stemmes in ships at shore. Astonyed Rutils stood, euen he him selfe in minde affrayd Messapus, and his horses troubled were, the streames eke stayd Their waters hoarce of sound, and Tyber trembling foote retrayd. But not to Turnus bold did corage ought relent or hope. Mens harts w? words he lifts, &amp; cheering chydes with skornes at skope, These monsters to the Troyans come, lo god him selfe you see Hath take from them their strength, and wonted shift alwayes to flee, No Rutile powre doth neede, our fiers, our swords, they durst not byde, The seas therfore to Troians fast are stopt, no place to ryde Nor hope to skape they haue: lo, halfe the world beraft them is. As for the land in our possession lieth, and ouer this So many thousands strong Italian nacions armour beare. The Troians fatall songs, nor iuggling sights can me not feare, Nor answers from the gods, if any such the wretches boast. Ynough for Venus is, and destnies past, that once this coast Of rancke Italia land the Troyans poore had leaue to touche. By fortune them withstands, and I likewise may destnies vouche To kill that cursed broode, and for my spouse vproote them quite. Nor not alone this griefe doth Agamemnons kindred byte, Nor Greeks haue onely cause for wedlock spoyle them selfs to arme. Yet had it bin ynough to stroy them ones, if but one harme Suffized had their sin, and not with spite all female kinds Thus villaynly disdain? what? doth this half trench puff their minds? Doth dichwors giue them pride? so neare the death? such saufgard thin? Saw they not Troyan wals in fiers down sinke with gods within? But what is he (good mates) wil yonder trench with mee go teare With tooles, and ouerrun this campe, that trembling sinks for feare? I neede no Vulcans armes, nor thousand ships, I seeke them not. Let all Etruria ryse, and ioyne for helpe in Troyan knot. They shal not feare no darke, by night on them we list not steale, He preferreth him self before Græcians. We will betray no watch, nor keepers kill as Greekes did deale, Nor blinde in horses paunch will we go lurke, but cleere by day Their walles in compas round with fier, and soarce assaulting fray. They shall not thinke vs Greekes, nor at our youth haue cause to skof, I warrant them, nor such as Hector ten yeres long kept of. And now therfore since better part of day from vs is fled, Remaines no more, but sith we haue our things thus far wel sped, Prouide your selfe good cheere, and looke for fight to giue dispatch Therwhiles to set the skoute, and euery gate with ward to watch Messapus charged was, and walles to girt with fiers and lights. Of Rutils seuen and seuen to gard the siege, most actiue knights Elected were by lot, ech one his hundred souldiours led, Carnation creastid youth in burnisht gold gay glittring red. They stray, they shift their turnes, and al along down laide on gras, With wines them selfs they cheere, &amp; cups vpturne &amp; bolles of bras. Their fiers before them shine, and long with watch y? night they pas. Auoyding sleepe with mirth. These things beholding brim did from their walls the Troyans spie. In armour strong they stood, and some their towres did hold on hie, For drede they grope their gates, &amp; some did bridges clampring ioyne, And bulwarke banks they wrought, &amp; engine tooles to fend and foyne All weaponed, them or Menesteus and Serestus sharply plies, Whom lord Aeneas had, if any fortune hard should rise, Made maisters ouer youth, and gouernours all things to guide. Afront the vaumures long by lots to daungers truly tried The legion waiting stood obseruing course, ech keepes his charge. One gate did Nisus keepe most egre knight with speare and targe, Whom huntresse Ida sent as freend to serue Aeneas part, A bowman stout with shafts, and swift with stroke of whirling dart. Next him Euryalus his mate, whose fairer was there non Through all Aeneas campe, nor Troyan armour did put on. Fine princock fresh of face furst vttring youth by buds vnshorne. One loue between them was, &amp; ioyntly fought like brethren sworne. That time also they twaine one standing kept with gate beforne. Sir Nisus first, what is it? god sets thus mens minds on fire? Sweet freend? or is ech mans mind his god furth driuen by dern desire? Some great conflict or famous fact to attempt long while my brest Incessaunt mee prouokes, nor can content with quiet rest. Thou seest how careles now these Rutils bin this watch that keepe, Their lightes disseuered shine, and they them selues in wines &amp; sleepe Resolued slurg on ground, wide Silence walkes, now freendly harke What rising mooues my sprite, and wherupon my thought doth carke. Aeneas home to call bin Lords and people firmely set, And men they seeke to send, that tidings certaine soone may fet. If they will giue to thee such benefites as I requier, (For vnto me shall fame of so great fact suffice for hier,) By yonder banke thou seest, I could a way mee thinks finde out To passe to Euanders court, and by the same reuert about. Euryalus astonid stood, such loue him prickt of praise, He could him not conteyn, but to his freend thus feruent sayes. In things of so great weight my felowship doost Nisus grutch? Forsakst thou mee? should I send thee alone to daungers sutch? Not so my father Opheltes beaten in warres did mee conduct Through fearefull Græcia frayes, nor so my minde did euer instruct In trembling toyles of Troy, nor I with thee such parts haue played Since great Aeneas campe, and destnies mee extreme haue stayed. I beare a minde perdee dispising death, I lacke not spright To thinke this prayse well bought, with losse for thee of life and light. Nisus to this. Such things in faith of thee did I not dred, Gods forbod so to thinke, no, mee almighty Ioue so sped Or who so els of gods indifferent lookes, my head so strike. But if there should as many things thou seest in daungers like, If any sore misschap or chaunce or god should backward shooue, One fr?d wold saue the other fr? d?ger.I would thou shouldst remaine, thy yeres to liue don best behooue. Let one suruiue that mee from foes may take, or my dead corse For money may redeeme, and to enter haue some remorse, Rewarding mee with earth: or if my lucke not so vouchsaue, Giue offrings for my soule, and it set foorth with tombe or graue. Nor cause will I to thy deere mother be of so great grief, Who thee alone (O lad) pursues good soule of matrones chief, Respecting daungers non, and left Acestes land so lief. He there against. Excuses vaine, in vaine thou doost but knit, Nor mine affection first doth from my brest ought chaunge or flit. Let vs be gone (? he) and calles the skoute, they strayt supplied Their roumes, &amp; kept their turns. Thei leuing sta?dings both furth hied In one minde knit like mates, and for their king enqueering spied. All other breathing soules, on soyles disperst, than easments tooke, Releasing paines with sleepe, and cares from harts forgetfull shooke. The dukes of Troians chiefe, and chosen youth about them bolde, Their counsaile than supreame for kingdoms weight did carkfull hold, What should be don, or to Aeneas now who message beares, They leane with shields in hands, consulting sad vpon their speares. Amids the campe in field than Nysus to them fresh of chere, With mate Euryalus beseekes accesse, to speake them nere, A thing of burthen great and worthy of thanke they haue to breake. Ascanius furst them tooke, and Nisus quiuering bad to speake. Than thus, giue equall mindes, and eares to vs O princely peeres, Nor iudge not our deuise by our apparaunce light of yeeres. The Rutils silent lien in wines and sleepes and surfets dround, Eke wee our selues haue vewd for our atempt good space of ground, Where from our gate the way deuided parts, their fiers vnbroke, Descries their vacant shore, and to the stars the thicke blacke smoke, Disseuering spreads in skies, giue vs but leaue to take our chaunce, Wee to Euanders court vnto Aeneas close will glaunce. Him here with slaughter strong, &amp; spoyle more great than wee conceiue You shal see straite returne, nor vs our way can ought deceiue. Wee saw from far that towne in vales obscure downe crooking low, Continuall hunting there, and all that flood besides we know. Whan this Alethes heard right graue in age and ripe of yeeres, Gods, Gods, O countrey Gods, in whose protection Troy still steeres, You minde not (I perceiue) poore Troians yet to quench downe rights, Whan such coragious youth, such brests so bold, so liuelike sprights, It pleaseth you to send. And as he spake, he did embrace The necks and armes of both, and teares downe trickling fild his face. What gifts? what worthy gifts for such attempts and ventrous deedes May recompence you Lords? but for your vertues such must needes From gods come best reward? your maners eke no worse can gayne, All other things to you Aeneas prince shall pay full fayne. Ascanius also when he to perfit age attaynes Such kindnesse will requite, nor neuer shall forget your paynes. Yea I my selfe Ascanius than sayd, whose onely wealth Depends on you to see my syers retourning swift in health, By puissaunt Troian gods, vnto you Nysus both I sweare, By mine aduoury saints, by Vestas secretes hoare of heare, I here protest my fayth what euer chaunce or fortune haps What euer luck be mine, I put it whole in your two laps. Call backe my parent sweet, let one of him haue once a sight, No heauines my minde can in his presence make affright. Two cumly siluer cups I shall you giue with grauing drest, My father wan them both, when he Arisba towne supprest, Two big threefooted bolles, eke talents twaine most large of gold, An auncient bason broad Queene Didos gift of price vntold. And if our chaunce preuaile, that we our kingdome here may stay, To take Italia land, and by the lots deuide our pray, Thou sawest what palfray steede, what armor braue king Turnus bare All guilt, what sheeld? and how his helmet crest did streaming stare? Euen them to thee shal I from out the lots except with cure. Already thine they bee, thou maist accompt them Nisus, sure A dosen matrones eke, of thriftie kinred largest limd My father thee shal giue, with bondmen twelue of all things trimd, Besides those whole demaines, which king Latinus self doth keepe. But as for thee, O lad, to whom my yeres more nere do creepe. Thou reuerent stately child, how deepe in brest I thee receyue? Thou euer art my mate, whom force nor chaunce nor time can weyue. Shall neuer pompe to mee without thy porcion sure be fought, What euer peace or wars I make, my deeds, my words, my thought, Shall most remaine to thee: And hee againe made answere thus. No day shal mee disproue, nor of my deedes vnlike discus Fall fortune good or bad, thus much I graunt, but one thing thee, One graunt let mee require that passing all gifts is to mee. I haue a mother here, of Priams stock she comes of old. Whom neither Troian soyle could after mee (good creature) hold, Pietee and duety towards parents.Nor king Acestes walls, but mee at all times folowing sues. She hereof nothing knowes, what euer chaunce may mee misuse, Ungreetid her I leaue, this night I take and thy right hand To my record, that I my parents teares could not withstand. But thy relief to her I must needes craue to appeas her woo, Let mee that hope of thee for certain beare, the bolder goo Lo daungers all I shall, Than teares of eyes did thicke downe fall From Troyans pearced brests, and from Ascanius first of all. Eke print of pure paternall loue, his piteous minde gan gall. Than thus he spake. I promise all to thee that worthy is for so great fame. My mother she shalbe, and sauing only Creusas name: No diffrence make I shall, nor small rewards doth her remaine, Who such a fruit furth brought, what euer chaunce this fact obtaine. Now by this head I swere wherby my fire did oft protest, What euer graunt I gaue thy saulf returne if things did best: Unto thy mother sure and all thy kin shall firmely stand. So spake he weeping than, &amp; from his shoulders gaue with hand His bright broad golden sword, whom wondrous arts and works did wreath Of smith Licaons craft fine fitted light with Iuery sheath. Duke Mnesteus Nisus giues a Lions hyde of roughnes straunge, Unspoild with pawes, Alethes iust did helme with him exchaunge. Strait armed but they gone, whom lords and captains chief of sway Conducted through their gates, than youth and age for them did pray. Eke faire Ascanius tame furth nor vowes to gods did spare Discreete beyond his yeres, endewed with sprite and manly care. With things vnto his father tell he bad, but blastes did breath His words with wind, and scattring vain to clouds, did all bequeath. They ouer diches went, and by the shade of darke midnight Their enmies campe they pearce, there to destroy first many a wight. On euery side lay drinke, and strowne on gras all fast on sleepe Mens bodies thick they see, and carts with chardges non did keepe Here wheeles, here halter thongs, and men on traces slurging laid. Their armour mirt with wines. Than Nisus first bespeaking said. Eurialus, now bold bestur thy hands, now time prouokes, Here lieth our way, take heede, looke well about, bestow thy strokes. Let no man rise behind, make all things sure anenst our backes, I lead thee through this lane, and wide, and wast put all to wrackes. This spoken, speach he stopt, and sodenly with foine of sworde Proude Ramnes through he strake, that on his carpet clothes at borde Slaughters done by Nisus. Lay stretched breathing big, outsnorting sleepe with puffs from brest. A king he was, and to king Turnus deere he calkinges kest. But not with calking craft could he his plague betwitch that day. Than seruaunts next him three, which by the weapons rashly lay, With squire of Remus chief he strait supprest, and strait did fang His charet keper there, and cut their throten that down did hang. Than he their maisters head with sword of chopt, and left his tronke, Furth yexing belching blood, the soyle, the streames the tents vpdronke, With Lamirus, and Lamus, and Seranus stripling gay, Which daunsed had that night with amorous face, &amp; prompt did play. His limmes had Bacchus bound most lucky lad if he that night Suruiued had his sport, and drawn his ioy to broad day light. Euen Lion lyke, that troubling flocks of sheepe when folds are full (Wod hunger him prouokes) doth feede, doth fret, doth feare, doth pull, The sely soft beast (dim for feare,) his bloody teeth doth gnash. Slaughters committed by Euryalus.Nor nothing lesse this while, Eurialus did slaughters lash He throughly waxeth mad, and people much not worthy name, With Fabus, Hebesus, and Retus strong he kild for game, Eke Abaris, vnwares they were dispatcht, but Retus than Broade wakened all things saw, and hiding shranke behinde a pan. But folowing face to face he through his brest did thrust his blade Euen whole as he did rise, and in much death he made him wade, He spued his purple soule, and as he died his blood did spoute Uprendring wynes with life, he still by stealth besturs him stoute. And towards now Messapus mates they drew, where fiers on ground They saw did furthest fayle, &amp; steedes there stood at maungers bound, On forage feeding faire. Than thus in eare care did Nisus round, For him he did perceaue to sore, to furious set abroache. Let vs now leaue (? he) malicious day doth neare approche. They meetely well bin paied, our way is won through mids our foes. Much plenty siluer plate behind them left they glad did lose, Good armour, chardgers great, and costly carpets tapstry gay. King Ramnes trappers had, of gorgeous works that much did way, With bulions broad of gold, and gyrdling gyrthes miraclose fine, Which old duke Cedicus (men say) whan he furst did combine In absence freendly league with Remulus of Tyburt coast, He sent that present then, for he of wealth had ryches moast. Bequethed then from him his nephew kept them many a day, But after his decesse, the Rutils wan by war that praye. Eurialus them caught, and on his shoulders strong in vaine He fitly them bestowd, and of his spoyle he was right fayne. Than duke Messapus helme with beauteous crestes adorned pure On head he prits, than campe they leaue and passe their iorney sure. This while from Latin town, one troupe of horsmen sent that way, (While all the rest in legion armed stood and did but stay) Came furth, and answere brought of theyr estate to Turnus king. Three hundred shieldmen all, all vnderneth duke Volscens wing, And towards now the campe they drew, and walls approched nie, Whan from a far these men take left hand course they might espie. And by the glimsing night Eurialus that swift went on His hie helme him betraied, that brightsom beames reflecting shone, Was not for nought espied. Duke Volscens cryed amids his troupe, Stand felows, where this way? what be yee so that shrinking stoupe? Where run you armed thus? they not an answere to them gaue, But swiftly through the woods made hast in trust that night shuld saue. The horsmen kest them selfes in crokings knowen of quainted ground, Here, yonder, there, ech where, and entries all with keepers cround. A wood with bushes broad there was begrowne with bigtree bows, Whom thick entangling thornes, and bryry brambles fild with brows. No trade but tratling pathes, som here, som there that secret straies. Eurialus the braunches darke of trees, and heauy praies Don let, he cleane contrary runs beguild by wandring waies. Nisus went on, and enmies all vnwares had scaped quite, And past that place which afterwards Albanus mountaine hight Of Albas name, king Latin there great pastures did maintaine Whan furst he stood, and for his absent freend did looke in vaine. Eurialus poore lad, what countrey now shall I thee seeke? What path should I pursue? strait back againe from creeke to creeke Through that deceitfull wood vnwinding wayes perplext he sought, Still tracking marking steps through thickets silent stragling blind. He heres their horse, he heres their rustling noise, and enmies wind. Not long between there was when to his eares the cry came hot, And furst Eurialus he seeth whom all mens hands had got, Eurialus is taken. Through fraud of night and place of troublous tumult wareles trapt, Uainstrungling working much, but round about him all they wrapt. What should he do? what strength? how could he shift or dare dispose To rescue thus this lad? should he run rashly mids his foes? Enforcing faire to death with comely wounds his life to lose? He swiftly shooke his dart, and hie beholding bright the Moone He whirling bent his arme, and thus he feruent made his boone. Thou goddesse, thou this time, thou in our labours lende reliefe, Thou beauteous Queene of stars in forests virgin keeper chiefe. If euer gift for mee sir Hirtacus my father gaue Unto thine offrings seates, if euer I encreased haue Thy sacred altars fees, with hunting daily through my costs, Or deckt thy church with spoyles, or hangd about thy holy posts, Giue me to breake this plumpe, &amp; through y? skies now guide my dart. He spake: and straining totall strength his toole with hand and hart Kest furth, it whirling flew, and through the shade of shimring night It past, and into Sulmons backe with noise did sharpely light, In peeces there it brake, and to the hartstrings perst the wood. He tumbling (cold) outspued al hoat from brest his reking flood, Farfetching yexing slow, his guts vpgathering smites his sides. Eche man about them looke. Lo, yet againe a smarter glydes, Which he with force outslang, and leauel kest direct from eare. Whiles all they troubled stood, to Tagus whistling ran that speare, Athwart his head it came, and thirld him quite through temples twain With noise, where fixed fast it stack warme waxing through his brain. Duke Volscens storming frets, nor him that did that weapon fling He one where could behold, nor whither feruent mad to spring. But thou this while (? he) these two mens death shalt surely rue, If any hoat blood in thy hart there bee. And strait outdrue Against Eurialus his sworde. Than verely in deede dismaide Did Nisus loudly shrinke, nor more to lurke in darknes staide, Such torments than him tooke, he cried amain with voice affaied. Tis I, tis I, here, here I am that did, turne all at mee, O Rutils with your tooles, my onely craft here it is, not hee, He neither durst nor could, this heauen, these stars, I witnes take. Onely for to much loue his wretched freend he nold forsake. Such words he gaue, but deepe with dynt the sword enforced furst Had ransakt through his ribs and sweete white brest at once had burst. Down falles Eurialus in death, his limmes, his faire fine flesh Al runs on blood, his necke down fainting nods on shoulders nesh Wel like the purple floure that cut with plough letfalling lops In languish withring dies, or like weake necks of poppis crops Eurialus sleine.Down peising heauy heads, whan raine doth lading greue their tops. But Nisus to his enmies fearcely ran, and through their mids, Duke Volscens out he seekes, he onely Volscens battaile bids. Whom Rutils clustring close on ech side shoues, and stout withstands. Yet nerethelesse his sword like lightning bright with both his hands He swindging sturde, and as duke Volscens cried, he smote him so Volscens sleyne. Nisus sleyne. That through his throte in went, and euen in death he kild his fo. Than wery digd with woundes, on his dead freend him selfe he kest Expyring life at last, and tooke his death for pleasaunt rest. O fortunate both twaine, and if my verse may get good lucke, Shal neuer day nor time from mindfull age your praises plucke, While prince Aeneas house, while Capitol most stately stone Unmooueable shal stand, while Romain rules this world in one. The Rutil victor knights with spoyles and pray departed there, And Volscens dead their duke all weeping sad to campe they beare. For waiting lesse there was, whan Ramnes king was headles found, So many Lords at once through all the campe so strowd on ground, With Numa, with Serranus huge concourse and preasing strong About their bodies came, some yet halfe panting stretcht along. Ech place of slaughters smokes, &amp; stremes of blood did flushing fome. Anon they knew their spoyles, and duke Messapus helme come home. King Ramnes trappers eke with no small swet recouered sore. And now dame Morning furst bespreding lands with light renewd, Forsooke syr Tythons bed all heauenly paynted saffronhewd. Now sun disperseth beames, now things discouered broad bin vewd. King Turnus fresh his folks and strength of men, and armour steeres In complet harneis bright his brasen troupes to wars vpcheeres. Ech captein cals their bands, and rumours run mens moodes to prick. Besides all this (a piteous grisly sight) on speares they stick The heads of these two knights, and loud with cries they them pursue, They stick there heads vp on speres Eurialus, and Nisus. The painefull Troians tough did on their left hand walles within Resisting set their front, for flood their righthand compast in. Their trenches hie they hold, and lofty towres defending keepe, All pensiue standing sad, and heads on poales before them peepe To well poore wretches known w? filthy blood down dropping deepe. This while doth flickering Fame on message flie with fethrid wings Fame. Through all the trembling town, and swift in moment tidings brings. And filles the mothers eares of that yong strippling earst of tolde. All sodenly poore wretch, all heat her bones forsooke for colde, Lamentacion of Eurialus mother. Her weauing web down fell, &amp; spindels scattring thrown on ground, She flies furth (wofull soule) and howling shrill in womans sound Dissheuillid teares her heare, and to the walls in hast she speedes, She neither daunger kest, nor men regards, nor weapons dreedes. But heau? w? moane she fils, &amp; thus through people wailing spreeds. And is it thus, Eurialus, that I thy face behold, Mine ages late reliefe mine onely ioy, my comfort old? And couldst forsake mee thus thou cruell hart to leaue me alone? Nor entring daungers such might I thy mother caytiue crone, Obtayne thy talking last, and make on thee my latter stoundes? Alas, in land vnknowen, alas, to feede Italian houndes, To foules a pray thou liest, O welaway for euermore. Nor wretched mother I, thy funerals brought out before, Nor could come close thine eyes, nor wounds w? waters washing bath With clothing couering soft, which I both nights and dayes to rath Did ordaine gay for thee, and hourely hasting did prepare, In webbing wasting time to ease therby mine aged care. Where should I seeke? what countrey land containes my lims distract? What nacion teares my flesh, my funerals my membres ract? Is this thy gift O son, thou bringest me home, thy works of hands? Is it therfore that I thus folowed haue such seas, such lands? Dig, dig mee downe with darts, throw all on mee your weapons keene O Rutils (if ought pitie be) consume mee I be not seene. Or thou most mighty father of gods, haue mercy on my vnright, Down thrust this hateful head to Lymbo lakes most lurking light, Since otherwise my lothsome life to breake I haue no might. With sorowing thus mens mindes molested shrank, &amp; sad through all Deepe mourning makes them slacke, vnuicted strengthes begin to pall. She blobbring still, and kindling further greif two kinsmen stept, Commaunded by sir Ilione and Ascanius much that wept, Between them her they tooke, and bare to house and there her kept. But brightbras troupe from far, his fearfull shiuring sounds expels, Thick, thick, and therupon men shout, that hie heauen yalping yels. They giue an assault.The Volscans ioyntly knit, with targates couering close their heads, The trench attempting teare, &amp; rampier stakes with dich down treads. Some seeke their entring breach on skaling ladders clambring quicke Where few resisters stand, and soldiours round ring not so thick, Where wall most entershines. Against them Troians hie from tops, Al sorts of turments turne, &amp; thicke them down they thrust with props, Expert in long defence, and practise old to keepe their towne. Great stones also they weld intollerably tumbling downe. If any where that couered plumpe might breake, whan they againe Did vnderneth theyr shields all chaunces hard conioynt sustaine. Nor now they more can byde, for where their engine ioynes his iolle, A huge vnweldy weight the Troyans rumbling downe did rolle, Whose fall did Rutils whelme and brake their tortais roof distwinde. No more with such deceit they care to coape in conflict blinde Strongharted Rutils bold, but from the trench they seeke to driue With darts and hurling tooles. On th'other side with odious noise a lothsome sight to looke, His fyriesmoking bronds on standarstaff Mezentius shooke. But d[illeg.] Messapus tamer strong of steeds, god Neptunes brood Cuts down theyr trench, &amp; skales their walls, he cries outragious wood. Now muses help, now help, now to my song aspire your breath, What murthring quars of m?, what heaps down thrown, what toils of death King Turnus then did giue, and who? what man sent downe to hel? Reuolue with mee this war, and chaunces huge what things befel. You ladies, your remembre best, and vttring best can tell. A towre of steepe vpsight there stood, with skaffolds large of length In place vpframed fit, whom all the Italians total strength Incessaunt still did sault, and force extreame of charge at ones They spent to ouerturne. The Troyans it defend with stones, And through their launcet loupes their whirling darts do thick bestow, A blasing burning linke of cresset light did Turnus throw, And to the side the flame did fixe, whom winde vpheauing hoysts, Which fastning caught the bourds deuoring posts and timber ioysts. They bustling quicke within for feare gan quake, and as to flee They sought, and toke the side, which of that deadly plague was free, Whiles clustring close they cling: Than sodeinly the towre for weight Down fel with thondring force, that heauen did ratling rore on height. Haulf mangled dead to ground men by that building huge opprest Came peecemeale tottring down, som torne with timber through theyr brest, Some w? their own tooles thirlid were, yea scant with much ado, One Helenor, and Lycus skoope, the elder of them two Helenor borne of Meons concubine Was Helenor, whom bond Lycinia maide to Meon king Broughtforth by stealth, his father him to wars while youth did spring Unlawfull sent to Troy, his worship win he should in feeld, All light with naked blade, yet honourles, yet blanke in sheeld. He whan him selfe he saw so many thousand men among, Great armies here, great armies there, on ech side Latines strong: Euen as a beast whom hunters round in ring haue gotten in hold, She seeth no way to scape, than willingly to slaughter bold She frantike runs on death, &amp; beares downe tooles, &amp; boaresperes edge. Nonotherwise this lad, where enmies thickest him did hedge, With will to die did breake among the mids constraining stripes. But Lycus better far with feete, euen through his enmies gripes, Euen by their weapons swift escaped had, and swift with hands Endeuouring climes his wall, his mates to reach on roofes that stands. Whom Turnus in pursuit did with his weapon thrown arest, Lycus taken.Him catching railing thus. What doost thou think y? madbraind beast, To skape scotfree from vs? and as he there did pendant skrall, He pluckt him backe by force, with great peece folowing from the wall. Euen as an Egle doth some tymrous Hare, or neare great brookes Some Lilywhyted swan vplifting heaue, in talent hookes. Or suckling lambe whom bleating long the dame still seekes about, Which from the coat the rauening Wolf hath caught. On ech side shout Doth ryse, inuasion hoat begins, than rampier bankes are brast. Some other burning bronds to houses tops do flingring cast. And as Lucetius came with pitch and flame to fier the gate, Syr Ilionee with stone downe tumbling, quite did quath his pate, With stone downe toppling great, no litle lumpe of broken hill. Than Lyger did Emathion, Corynee Asylas kill, He good at dart, that other chiefe with shaft that far begyles. Syr Ceneus Ortagium slew, but Turnus him exyles From life, and Turnus Ityn kilde, and Clonyus, and with him Syr Promulus, and Sagar, syr Dyoxip large of lim, With Ida boystous knight, before the towres that ward did beare. Pryuernum Capis kilde, him furth before Themillas speare, Had pinched small with prick, he like a dolt kest of his targe, And handling groapt his griefe, an arrow therfore swift with charge His left side wing came by, and to his ribs his paw made fast, That loongs, and breathing pipes, that mortal stroke with brusing brast. There stood in armour fine, the worthy son of Arceus duke, Gay needle wrought in cloke, embroided brown in Spaniards puke, Much noble, fayre in face, his father him to warfare sent, Syr Arceus bred in woods, and by the floods of Simeth bankes, Where stands Palycus church, and altars gracious rendring thankes. A whistling whirling slyng Mezentius tooke, and armes downe flang, Him selfe three times the thongs about his head in compasse twang, And leuel right him strake, that in the mids the melting lead His temples twaine did sliue, and large on dust outstretcht him dead. Than furst, Ascanius in war his swift shaft (as men say) Ascanius first exploit in war. Did shoote, which woonted was before wilde skittish beastes to affray, And with his hand sir Numan proude downe layd, whose surname hight Duke Remulus, he Turnus yonger sister lately plight, Then wedded had. He royster furst in forefront rayling loude, Things toto bad reuiled, of kingdomes new promocion proude, All spyteful swolne in brest, and byg with noyse him selfe did beare. Are ye not yet ashamed to lurke in hoales eftsoones for feare? Twise captiues Troians? what? thinke ye by walles to saue your liues? First by Hercules, next by Greekes. These be the princocke bloods, lo how they looke that fight for wiues? What deuil? wha mischa?ce? wher were your wits, what madnes blind Italia made you seeke, you shal not here Atrydas finde, Nor pratler preaching lyer Vlisses fine to teache men speake. Wee be a stouter stocke, in other sort our sonnes wee breake. Our children furst from byrth into the floods wee throw to swim, With waters numme and frost wee harden tough both hart and lim. Our boyes on hunting run, they study still to beate their woods, Their playes are Darts of horne, and for disport breake horses moods. As for our youth they toyle, and either ground they tame with rakes, Contenting mindes with small, or towns in wars besieging shakes. We wear our liues in spending steele, w? speares our beasts wee pricke, Our droue of heards, our booties daily encrease, nor age vnquicke Enfebleth ought our mindes, nor altreth natures force in fleshe, Our hoare heares helmets hyde, and ouermore our prayes afreshe Wee fetch from countries far, it doth vs good to dryue and watche, We warlyke lyue by spoyles, euen by the things our hands can catche. You must haue painted weed, gay ioly Ierkins, saffron shirts, Your slipcoats must haue sleeues, your coxcom coiues, b?graces girts, Your study chief is daunse in pampring feasts with giglet flirts. O very Troyan trulles (for Troians are you non) go fooles, Go fisgigs, frisk your woods with double pype in skipping skooles Hark how your minstrels cal, your tabrets, bagpypes, shalms, of boxs. Go trim your treslock tyres, get on your gloues, your finest frockes. Geue weapons vp for men, let warrs alone for catching knocks. Him cracking thus, and iangling more dispite with odious songs Ascanius could not beare, but sinnowy bow of horse hide thongs He bent, with pointed shaft, and armes disbukling seuerall wayes. Before hie Ioue he stands, and humbly thus with vowes he prayes. Almighty Ioue giue to my bold beginning good successe, Unto thy temple shall I solempne gifts of offrings dresse, A yong steere white as snow, with guilded front of liuely lust, Hyeheaded like his dame, and with his horne desyres to iust, Already strong which with his feete vpsparpling spredes the dust. The father aloft him heard, and vnder cleare skie lefthandlowe, Did signe of thondring shew, than with a sound from deadly bowe, The swift shaft whistling fled, &amp; through sir Numans temples twain It grisly strake. Go go mens manly dedes with mockes disdaine, Twise captiues Troians lo, these aunsweres Rutils send againe. Ascanius spake put thus, the Troyans then with ioyfull voyce, Al ioyntly gaue their shouts, and lifting minds to starres reioyce. That time as fortune was brightheaded Phœbus for disport Behold from ayry coast bothe Latines hoasts, and Troyan fort, As hye on could he sat, and thus to Ascanius gaue report. Thats thats my peereles lad, such vertues new leades lords to stars, Begotten of gods, and gods engender shalt, by right al wars Must vnder Dardanes line, in time by destny quite downe sinke. Nor Troy can thee containe, and with that word er one could winke, Him selfe from skie down skips, &amp; breathing puffs remoues from aire. Than to Ascanius he drawes, and chaunged countenaunce faire, Phœbus res?bleth Buten.Resembling Buten old. He to Anchises great from childe Was henchman bearing armes, and kept his garde of trust vnfilde, The old man him to Ascanius then had put, so Phœbus went, All thinges like aged man, both voyce, and hew he did present, White heary locks and angrisounding armour, calme of brest, And to Ascanius thus that feruent was his words he drest. Let it suffice thee now that Numan freely vanquisht is Good child: lo now Apollo great commends thy prayse for this. He geues thee chief renown, nor lyke with tooles to match doth passe. Abstaine hencefurth from blowes my boy, so Phœbus entring was: And in the mids his tale, mens mortal eyes he cleane forsooke, Desserring thinne from sight, and flittering fourme to skies betooke. The lords beknew that god, perceiuing strayte his tooles deuyne, His arrow sheues they heard, and ratling noyse of boltbag fine. At Phœbus word therfore, and in respect of his great grace, Ascanius backe they kept that egre was, them selfs in place Succeeds, and ventring liues eftsones to daungers turne their face. A clamorous noise vpmounts on fortres tops and bulwarkes towres. They strike, they bend their bowes, they whirle from strings sharp shoting showres. Al streets with tooles ar strowd, th? helmets sculs with battrings mard, And shields dishiuring crack, vpryseth roughnes bickring hard. Loke how the t?pest storm, whan winds outwrastling blowes at south, Raine ratling gets the ground, or clouds of haile from winter mouth Down dashing headlong driues, whan god from skies with grisly steu?, His watry showres outwrings, and whirlewind clouds downe breakes from heauen. Pandarus &amp; Bitias. Syr Pandarus and Bitias, two brethren, Troyans stout, Whom to Alcanor knight dame Hera saluage Nimph brought out Among Ioues sacred woods, in firtree groues of mountaines colde, Two valiaunt boystous knights, coragious, strong, and equal bold, A gate that by their captaine damned was they broad set oape, So trusted they their strength, and bids their foes come neare to coape. Them selfes before their towres, both right, &amp; left hand braue out stept All armed stif in steele, and bright with crests their standings kept, Hyheaded like two trees, like two great Okes by Padus banks, Besides their ioyfull flood, aboue their mates they ryse by rancks, Their heads to heauen they lift with lofty tops vnshorne they beck, Beshadowing broad the bows, and hie surstretching skies they check. The Rutils in they breake whan furst they saw their entrie free. Immediatly the Dukes in armour gorgious gay to see, Syr Quercens, and Equicolus either beaten turne their backs, Or they with all their bands euen in the gate went dead to wracks. Th? more &amp; more mens minds disordring chafe c?tempning doubts, And thither Troians now round gathring draw, by plumpes &amp; routs, Conflicting hand to hand, and further salyeng dare ron outs. To captain Turnus fierce, than troubling folks on backfort side A post with message runs, how Troians now haue caught new pride, Great murther stoutly made, and how their gates broad ope they set. He leaues his works begun, and huge with wrath to giue the onset, To that presumptuous gate, and brethren proude, he rushing runnes. And furst Antyphaten, of king Sarpedons bastard sunnes The chief by Theban dame, for he against him furst did shoue, He threw down dead with dart, the Italian tronke in skies aboue Disseuering, tender aire, came through his brest and out at back, His stomack round it rent, y? wound from caue giues out blood black Permixt with foms, and fixt in loongs the steele warme waxing stack. Than Merops, Aphidnus, and Erimanth with sword he slew. Than Bitias that boystrous sturd with eies of sparckling hew, Not with no dart, for dint of dart, could life not make him yeld, But thrown w? strength extreme, a tronched speare most str?g to weld, Big like a lightning bolt at him he draue, whom doubled folde Could neither backs of bulls, nor brest plate faithfull strong of golde Susteine from mortall plague, his membres huge down foltring flusht, Bitias sleine.The ground at falling grones, and thondring huge his shield he crusht. As by the Bayon shore men building hauens done for the nones With laboring l?g beforn, through engins means lay m?strous stones. Down sinks the weldlesse weight, and on the ground it setled stands. The wilde seas meeting mixe, and darkning skies vpleapes the sands. Than with the soundes the soyles adidynant shake, &amp; mountains next, Where whelmd by gods reuenge in dongeons deepe are giants vext. Their army puissant Mars both pricks, and force to Latins harts Did ad, and stings of egre wrath, in ech mans brest vpstarts. He made the Troians flee, and gaue them blackday mixt with dreede, From euery side they flocke since now the sight proceedes in deede, And in their mindes the murthering angell sits. Whan Pandarus his brother saw down falne before his eyes, In what case fortune stands, and how things now in daunger Iyes: The gate with much turmoyle conuerting hinges hookes on rings, With shoulders shouing broad at last he shuts, and bolts vpwrings, And many his mates in hard conflict he leaues, and out them lockt. But other he receyues as with the preas they rustling shockt. Unprudent man, that whan the Rutil king did through intrude Could him not entring spie, but in the fort did him include, Euen like a Tyger wilde among the flocks of cattailes rude. Incontinent new light theyr eyes distraines, and armour straunge Did grisly giue theyr sound, his quiuering crest with bloodread raunge Like beames of lightning burns, &amp; from his shield that flames outflew, Anon theyr hatefull face, and monstrous lyms the Troyans knew, Distraught with sodein sight. Than for his brothes Pandare huge Incenst with feruent wrath: Thou shalt haue here but bad refuge, This is no ioynter towne, king Latyns wife gets here no gage, Nor she (? he) thy fathers walls this time empounds in cage. Thine enmies fort thou seest, hence neuermore shall Turnus out. To him than Turnus spake, all smyling sober free from doubt. Begin (if any manfull minde thou hast) approch mee round. Ish make thee Priam tell that here thou hast Achilles found. Thus speaking an vnshapen bunchy speare with barke vnpilde, Sir Pandare whirling threw, with strength extreme it went welwilde. Iuno preserued Turnus life. The winds vpcaught that stroke, and Iuno Queene the daunger brake, Wrongwresting as it went, and in the gate did sticke the stake. But not this toole, of mine which in my right hand here I shake, Shalt thou escape, great difference now shall our two puissans make (Quod he) and stretching broad with armes his sword did mo?ting lift, His brainpan through it smote, and in the mids it made a clift, Deuiding chekes, &amp; chaps, and heares vpgrowen with gaping wound. The soyle than shuddring shooke, and with the weight did yeld a sound. Downe liueles falls his lims, and armour mixt with blood and brain With corps he strowd the ground, &amp; equal clyuen in porcions twain, His head on shoulders hung, one here, one there disseuered slain. The Troians than for fear theyr feete gan take with trembling flight, And if he victor than remembred had, and tane foresight, Strait waies to breake the bolts, and through the gates his folks let in, That day to Troyan war, and to their lynage last had bin. But furious feruent minde, and greedy lust of slaughters more Enforst him forward still. Furst Phalarim and maister veines of Giges huge he sheares. And as the people fled he gathering darts, and skattred speares Bestowed them in their backes, for Iuno gaue both might and minde. Than Halim felow vnto them he ioynes, and kylls behinde Syr Phegius with targat pyke downe pusht, than vp the wall He runs, and such as fighting there, of this knew nought at all Neomonus, and Prytanis, with Hellus he downe slew. Alcander than and Lynceus which toward him stout drew, Outmustring mates for helpe, he leaping trench did swift preuent, And with his glittring glayue he such a stroke vnwares him lent, As hand to hand he fought, that quite from shoulders at on chop Lynceus slayne. His head with helmet fel, and far from him did hobbling hop. From thence sir Amycus he slits that wilde beasts euer stroyed, More lucky none there was, nor neuer man more oft them noyed, With oyntments arming steele, w? poysoned tooles he stil them cloyd. Than Clytius, and the dulcet freend of Muses Cretea fine. Syr Cretea Muses mate that euermore with voyce deuine Melodious warblid songs, his pastime chief was harpe and kit, By numbring ran his Rimes to synowy cords concurrant fit: Alwayes of steedes, of armes, of men, he sang of battails maine. At last the leaders great, whan they first heard their men so slaine, The Troyan captaynes came, sir Mnesteus and Serestus strong, They saw their stragling mates, and enmy entred thicks among. The Troians are rec?fortedAnd Mnesteus, what auayles this flight? where run you now (? hee?) What better bulwark walles? what other townes or trench haue yee? One man alone (O sirs) euen in your mids inclosd in campe, So many slaughters made? in such a fort round skotfree rampe So many chieftain knights vnuenged sends to Lymbo dampe? Make ye no more of countrey soyle remorse? faintharted fy? What shall we shame our gods? and great Aeneas nought set by? With such rebukes mens minds vpkindled staied, &amp; thick with preas They stood. But small and small from flight did Turnus than surceas, Retiryng to that side where flood the fortresse gyrdes about. So much the more pursute the Troyans make with restles shout, And clustring close they shooue. As when sometime men gathring thick A Lyon wilde assaylne, and hard with tooles oppressing pricke. But he affraied resists, sowerskowling grim he backward strides, And neither taile to turne his pride him lets, nor wrath his sides Will suffring make him shew, nor forward can set furth his ioynts, Though faine he would, not able he is yet for men, for weapons points. None otherwise did Turnus than retracting seeke bypath, With stalking doubtfull steps, and deepe in minde reboyles his wrath. Yet notwithstanding twise his enemies mids he did inuade, And twise conuerting backs them take their walles in flight he made. But th'uniuersall campe together ioyning whole did rise, Nor Iuno Queene durst more against such strength so great suffice. For Ioue vnto his sister downe her ayry Raynbow sent With message nothing milde, and how that some should soone repent If Turnus from the Troians loftie walles did not reyeeld. The yong prince now therfore, with neither right hand yet, nor shield Enduring can resist, so thick thrown tooles on ech side prest About his temples round bigbounsing beats, nor neuer at rest His helmet tinckling tings, &amp; stones with bumpes his plates disglosse. His topright crest from crown downe battred falles, nor brasen bosse Sufficient is for strokes so doubledriuing they not stint. The Troians all with speares, eke he him selfe with lightning dint Syr Mnesteus forward shoues, than euery lym on streaming swet Doth drop down black as pitch, nor giues him time his breth to fet. Faint panting puls his ioynts, and tyerd with pains his entrails beat, Than with a leape at last to Tyber flood in all that heat He headlong kest him selfe, in complet armour compast all. He smooth with chanell blew did softly him receyue from fall, And to his mates him glad (fr? slaughters washt) home sent withall. DEO GRATIAS. Per Thomam Phaer, 3. Aprilis finitum 1560. Opus 30. dierum THE TENTH BOOKE of the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. Iupiter calling a parliament of Gods, exhorteth th? to concord. Venus complayneth of the Troians danger, and Iunos vnsaciable malice, and requireth at length some end of calamities. Iuno layeth all the blame in the Troians, as the first causers of war, &amp; in Venus her selfe. When Iupiter perceaueth they would grow to no agreement, to offend neither his wife nor his daughter: he promiseth to take part with neither, but will put of all to the indifferencie of destenies. This while the Rutilians returne to thassault with all their force, whom the assaulted repel w? all their might, &amp; this in Latium. Aeneas hauing brought al things in Etruria to wished end, beinge assisted by diuers peoples: returneth to his mates with a nauye of thirtie sayle. There hee meeteth with the Nimphes that were not long before transformed from ships, &amp; is by them certefied both of the losse of his fleete, and of the daunger of his men. Then he landeth his power within the sight of his enemies. The Rutilians leaue the siege, and run to shoare to kepe the enemy from landinge. There they fight with great losse on both sides. Where Pallas, after many slaughters on his enemies: is at length slaine by Turnus. With sorow wherof, Aeneas all enraged: maketh plenty bloudoffrings on his foes for his frends soule. Th? Ascanius issueth forth, and ioyneth power with his father. Iuno carefull for Turnus, casteth before his eyes a false representation of Aeneas. Which, whilst he pursueth into a ship: Iuno breaketh the cables, &amp; by force of a tempest, bringeth him to the shoare neare Ardea. Mezentius then, at Iupiters c?maundment, entreth y? battle, and sleyth many both Troians and Etruscans, vntil Aeneas haue wounded him, &amp; being rescued by Lausus his sun: is scarce able to depart the field. Lausus is also sleyne by Aeneas whilst he endeuoreth to reuenge his fathers wound. Which when Mezentius vnderstood: he returneth into the battle, &amp; is sleyne by the same hand y? his sun was. Broad open in this while of glorious god th'almighty hall, The father of gods, &amp; king of men him self doth councel cal Into the starbright seat, whens kingdoms large in seas and landes He lofty low beholds, both Troians fort, and Latins bands. In parliment house they sat twigated wide: him selfe begins, Celestials great, how happens now so soone your sentence twins Reuoltyng iudgement fixt? why shew ye thus with minds vnmeete, Ioue foredefending warres, by Latins now on Troyan fleete? What discord now contrarious makes you fearce? what wroth, what feare Sets these or those on gog not suffring rest to shield nor speare? A time to fight there comes, call not to fast for fatall houres, When wilde Carthago proud in tract of yeres to Romish towres Destruction great shal send, and mountaine tops down tearing breake. Punick warres. Than spare not your despites, than rap and reaue who list and wreake. Now let them rest, and quiet league compound your selues to smight. Thus Ioue in brief, but not in brief than golden Venus bright Replied as thus. Venus c?playnt. O father, O thou euerlasting strength of god, and man, For what thinge els haue we to whom for helpe now cry we can? You see how Rutils rampe and with what brauery bolne in pride King Turnus prosperous rydes, scant in their wals can Troians bide, But euen amids their gates, euen on their bulworks rampier brims They bickring dayly die, that trench and dich with bloodshead swims. Aeneas absent knowes not this, will you giue neuer leaue To rest poore soules from siege, must enmies euer still downe reaue The walles of springing Troy? and yet more stil with stra?gers hoasts Poore Troians troubled bin, yet ones againe from Greekish coasts Must Diomedes ryse? I wene my flesh must yet be cut, And mee your heauenly child man mortall shall to daungers put. But if contrary to the pleasue of your heauenly grace, In Italy ben Troians entred wrong, vsurping place, Than let them buy their sinnes, nor ayde them not, but if they haue But folowed your precepts, which gods and spright such numbers gau Why now should any creature dare controle or hang down groyne To bend backe your decrees, or destnies now presume to royne? What should I now reherse our nauy brent at Sicil shore? Or name the king of stormes with all his tempest winde vprore Against vs whole vpraisde, and Raynbow clouds so oft down strainde. And now the fends forsoth, for that one quarter yet remainde Unsought besides the world, yet sodenly lo thence to skies Alecto reare she did, and made by madnesse towns vprise. Supremitie, nor for their empier moues me not such things, We looked long in vaine while fortune was, but this not wrings. Make victours whom you fauour most, our hope so hie not springs. If no one corner be that your spouse can vouchsafe to giue To Troians poore for spite, nor countrey none, nor place to liue, Yet by the piteous fall of smoking Troy from soyle destroyed, Good father I beseeke, let me Ascanius keepe vncloyed: Let me my nephew small withdraw from Mars, as for my son Aeneas, he shall tosse in seas vnknown as earst hath don. And what way fortune leades, where euer it bee, let him go proue, Yet let me saue his childe and him from battails hard remoue. In Cypres land some cities faire I haue, I haue Cythere, Idalium, Paphos hie, and Amathus, let him dwell there, Unfamous free from wars, and honourlesse lead out his age. Than may your grace condempne all Italy to great Carthage In slauedome vnder Moores, no hindraunce than to Affrick towres Can come, large empier rule they may no Troians nere their bowres. What hath our seruice now preuaild, what goodnes haue we got By skaping Greekish fiers, and mortall plagues of Mars so hot? So many parlous lands, such wast wide seas with paines outworne, While Troians Latium seeke, to reyse the walles so oft down torne? Had it not better been, if in their countreys reking dust, On soyle where Troy did stand they setled had, than thus to trust? Yet giue them wretches leaue to turne their backs, and home retier Unto their natiue streames, lorde be so good at my desier. Reuert their former toyles, all miseries that earst haue beene Iunos reply.Giue ones againe to Troians gracious sir. Than Iuno Queene Enforst with furious rage vprose: why doost thou me constraine Deepe silence now to breake, and to disclose my couched paine? Did either god or man Aeneas thine to war compell? King Latin to impugne, or yet his subiects cause rebell? Italia land he tooke by destnies worde, admit so were Through mad Cassandras sprite, yet did we euer tyre him there To leaue his campe vnkept? and to the winds his life commit? To giue his childe the charge of walles, and wars did we giue writ? Or make him nacions moue in rest that sate, or faithes remit? What god did such deceit? where was that time that power of ours So sore? or where was Iuno than, or bowe down sent with shoures? Is it so vyle a thing that springing Troy besieged stands With fier? and that king Turnus seekes to saue his countrey lands, Of king Pilumnus blood Venilia Nimph that had to dame? What is for Troian theeues, all Italy with bronds to flame, Subdue their neighbours lands, and robbrie booties riue by snaps, Compel men giue them wiues, and spouses reaue fr? parents laps, Entreat for peace by beckes, and traitors arme their ships for traps? Thou couldst Aeneas thine from hands of Greekes somtime withdraw, Suppliedst his place with cloude, with empty winde of wauering flaw. Thou couldst conuert their fleete to seuerall ships with storms renewd. If wee helpe Rutils ought, lo what a sin, what broile is brewd? Aeneas absent knowes not this? nor may he absent know. Thou hast Cithera townes, hie Paphos, and Idalium low, Why troublous sturst thou thus mens angry moodes, why doost procure New warres to Latium town that trauayls old could scant endure? Ist wee that will vpturne the flittring state of Troy from soyle? Came it by vs, or first by him, that Greeks made Troy a spoyle? Who first began that cause, why rose in armour fixt on wreke Europa and Asia both? who did their leage by theuedom breke? Was it by my conduct, th'aduoutrer stale the Sparta Queene? Gaue I them tooles to trie, or louers wars mainteind with spleene? Then oughst haue ben affraid for thine, now causles doost but square In vaine, and flimflam flirts out throwst at them that nothing care. Such talkings Iuno gaue, and heauenly wights with murmor round All sondry cried assents, as first whan blasts begin to sound, With puffes they wag the woods, and tombling blind with soft vprore, They nere pronostike winds, and tels the seaman stormes before. Th'almighty father than that all thing rules in totall some, Bespake, and at his speech, the court of high gods staggred domme, And from the grounds the soyle contrembling shooke, than lofty ayre, Than winds layd downe their noyse, and calme sea surges setled fayre. Take this therfore in minde, and in your brests imprint my saws, Since Rutils with the Troians will not knit nor take no laws, And forasmuch we see your quarell striuings make none ends: Loke how mens fortune stands, this day what hope ech one pretends, Be it Troian or Italian he, no difference finde they shall, Our iudgement right shall stand, this is our sentence once for all. If fatall fortune be that Troian campe besieged is, Or Troians by deceit Italia lands haue taken amis, Nor Rutils we discharge, ech mans owne medlings euen or od Shal praise or penaunce bring, Ioue sits in different all mens god. God is indiffrent to al men.The destnies will inuent a way, yea by our brothers brooke, By pitch of Lymbo pits, by gulfs and lakes so glom that looke. He gaue a nod, and at his beck, whole heauen obedient shooke. This end the talking had, king Ioue from golden throne vprose, Whom home to heauenly court celestials garding all did close. The Rutils all this while, at euery gate their battries plyes, With dead men ground they strow, and wals beset with fire that flies. The Troyan garisons in campe with hard siege be bestad, Nor hope of flight they haue, on towres poore men they stand ful sad. Smal furthring ro?d at vamures tops, w? str?gth which thin thei had Duke Imbras out of Asia land, and duke Tymetes bold, Assaracus two captaines, with sir Castor Tyber old, At forefront battell kept, with them there stoode the brethren twaine Of king Serpedon great, than noble Ethmon dragd his traine With lords of Lycia land, him selfe right huge with total might, For burthen bare a rock, a mountaines peece not small in fight. Syr Agmon at Lyrnesia borne, inferior not in facts To great sir Clitius his syre, or his brother Mnesteus acts. Those ply their darts, these other striue to fend with stones and bowes. Their wield fire fast they fling, from sinowy strings sharpe shafts out throwes. Ascanius described.Him selfe amids them chief dame Venus darling, iustest care, Their yong prince loth proceedes with reuerent face headnaked bare. As perle it precious shynes, or glistring stone bright gold that parts, Which garnish maidens necks, or set forth heads, or as whan arts Haue medled finely moldes, and Iuery cleere enclosd in boxe, From tablet seemly shewes, his milkwhite shoulders lifts his locks, His heare downshadowing shed, but gold embroiding bindes their docks. Thee there also coragious knight sir Ismar all men saw, With cast of canes enuenimed, thine enemies blood to draw. Thou gentle knight of gentle Meons house, where fields right fat Bene batfull wrought with men, where flood Pactolus gold doth scrat. Syr Mnesteus also there was seene, whom proud of al mens praise, For Turnus hard repulse, much glory hie to heauen doth raise. And Capis, he to Capua towne did surname furst deriue. They still among them selues, in hashards hard of wars did striue. Distrest Aeneas than with ships at midnight streames did cliue. For from Euander first whan to Etruria campe he came, He met their king, and to their king declared his blood, and name, What help he seekes, what help also he brings, what peoples mights Mezentius gathering drawes, of Turnus brest the spitefull sprights He shewes, and wherupon mans wit in such case may conclude He giues aduise, with mixt entreating words: all which thing vewde, Strait Tarchon ioynes his strength, &amp; leage c?po?ds, th? free fr? crime By destny songs of gods, the Lydian host did nauie clime, Duke Tarchon. With alean, lord for guide. Aeneas formost helde shith ship, Her stately stem on streames, with Lions large of Troy doth slip, With Ida mount on pup most freendly signe to Troyans lost: There great Aenas sits, and with him selfe reuoluing tost The various ends of warres. On left hand Pallas next his side. And now the stars he seekes that ships in dim night serue to guide. Now call to minde he doth, by seas and lands his trauailes tride. Now muses moue my song, now let me sup your learning streams, To tell what manred strong, what company from Tuscan realmes Aeneas armed brought, conueyed by waues on timber beames. Duke Massicus with brasen ship cald Tyger, cuts the floods, With him a thousand hands from Clusa walles, all youthful bloods, The names of such as tooke Aeneas part. And they that came from Cosa towne armed with shafts, and dartes. Corites with shoulders light, and from their bowes but death departs. Grymskouling Abas big, his bands fine harnest gorgeous steames Reflectes, and Phœbus on his golden pup stood light with beames. Sixe hundred valiaunt lads dame Pupulon his dame him gaue, Expert in feats of war, three hundred more from Ilua braue, Where neuer cessing soyle doth steelebright stuff send out from mines. Than don Asila priest, that gods and men can skrie by signes, Whom secret vaines of beasts, whom stars of heauen obeyen at beck, And thretning lightning fiers, and chattring birds with toong y? queck, His .M. people thick in throngs he drawes rough ranckt with speares. All these obedient came from Pisa coastes whom Alphe reares, Their towne is Tuscan soyle. Than fairest Astur next pursues, Syr Astur trusting steed, and armour braue of chaunging hewes: Three hundred they do ad, all issued out with one good will, Such as Cerites house did keepe, or Mymon croftes did till. All Prigus antique brood, Grauisca timeles troupes did fill. Yet will I not neglect thee also lusty Lumbard lord, Thou Siquus warriour strong, and with thy few of ioynt accord Syr Supaue from whose helmet crests rise fethered winges of swan, Your slaundring grew of loue, your cognisaunce your sier began. For Tignus (as men say) whan he for Phaeton mourning made Among the Popler bows, and vnderneth his sisters shade, Whiles whewling sad he sat, and long lamenting sang for loue, Al fethered white with down, hoar age did him from man remoue. Than Swan he left his lands, and folowed stars with voice aboue. His son with equall bands accompanied with fleeting ships, His m?strous Centaure shoues with ores, she huge with tugging trips, And to the water threatning stone she shewes, with strength men pull The vnweldy weight in waues, &amp; deepe seas long she shears with hull. Eke from his natiue countrey coasts great strength sir Ocus tooke, Mantua of Mantus.Of Mantus destnie speaker, and the sonne of Tuscan brooke. Which gaue thee Mantua walles, and of his mother made the name Of graundsiers Mantua rich, but all one of one discent not came. Three nacions rule she doth, and vnder them foure peoples good, She prince on peoples sits, her strength proceedes from Tuscan blood. Fiue .C. knights from thence against him self Mezentius armes, Them Mintius lake, Benacus child, whom grey reeds close beswarms, Sent forth to seas in Pinetree ships, ful strong to venge their harms. Than graue Auletes went, and with his hundred beating Ores He topsy turnes vp streames, the marble fomes reboyles at shores. Him Tryton combrous bare, that galeon blew with whelkid shell, Whose wrinckly wreathed flue, did fearfull shrill in seas outyell, He swam with swinging sides, and bresled heary rough from haunch, His face like mankinde showes, but foule in fish decaies his paunch. His monstrous saluage lims through froth, through some with flushing launch, So many chosen lords in threetimes ten of ships did slide To new Troy fast for ayde, and salt sea fome with brasse deuide. And now the day departed was from heauen, and hie with wheeles Night wandring dame Diane did midskie beat with palfreis heeles. Aeneas (for in carke to rest ons lymmes it nought preuailes) The ships of Aeneas transformed into Mermaids met him on y? wayHim selfe at sterne he sits, he guids his helme, he serues his sailes. To him in mids his way, th'assembly faire of ladies whight, Somtime his mates that were fr? ships transformed creatures bright, To whom great power of seas Queene Berecinthia did commit, They ioyning sweetely swam, and sweeping salt sea skum did flit. As many iust as ships with brasen stemmes did stand at shore. They knew from far their king, and sporting daunst his fleete before. Of whom the talker best, Cymodocee by name that hight, With right hand held his pup euen hard at back, and bolt vpright She brest high shewes her selfe, than faire in sight she cleare apeerd, With lefthand coutching waues, and smooth her self she vndersteerd. Than him vnwares she spekes, now wakest thou? wakest y? gods elect? Aeneas wake (? she) and sailes to bowling ropes obiect. We were thy sacred trees, on Ida mount sometime that grew, Now salt sea maides we been, thy fleete of late, whan force vntrew Of Turnus king, would vs, with swords &amp; flames haue quite consumed: Unwillingly thy hands we brake, and thus far haue presumed To seeke thee through the streames, in this forme vs our Lady put, Lamenting thy mischaunce, and made vs Mermaides seas to cut, In water lyues to lead, from whence non age vs out can shut. Thy child Ascanius in walles with deepe trench is beset Amids thy mortall foes, and Latines grim that armours fret. Euanders horsemen saufe at place commaunded keepes the lands, Conioynt with Tuscan strength, to set against them halfe his bands (Lest force to thee they ioyne) king Turnus full determinde stands. Arise, go to, and in the dawning first call forth thy mates, In armour first appeere, and take that shield which brode in plates The fyrypuissant god vnuict, gaue thee with golden grates. This morow morning next (if thou beleeuest I speake not vaine) Shalt slaughters huge behold of Rutils bloods by heapes downe slaine. She said, and in departing she with righthand pup did shoue, In sort as well she knew, the ship than straight in streames aboue Fled swifter forth then swiftest dart, or shaft that perceth winde. Than others mend their course, himself vnwares astoined in minde, The Troian prince did muse, yet with good lucke mens harts he cheres: Than shortly thus he praied, beholding round the Zodiac spheres. Almighty mother of gods, in whose great mercy Troy yet sits, That rulst both townes and towres, &amp; lyons yolkst with brideling bits, Thou be my patron prince, my guide in fight now prosperous stand To Troy good gracious dame, confirme thy signes with mightfull hand. These onely words he saied, and in this while the gray day light Returning ripe appeerd, and darknes far did chase of night. First to his mates he byds, that they their standars shal pursue. With armour match their mindes, and waite for fight in order due. And now in sight his Troian campe he hath, and vewes their field, Aduauncing stout on pup, in lifthand than his glistring shield Uplifting large he shewes, the Troians gaue to starres a crie, Ioy for succour.Upmounting on their walles, hope kindleth wrath with comfort nie: Their weapons vp they throw, as in the clouds done herds of cranes With crockling casting signes, wh? l?g in ayre they la?ch like lanes, Wh? southwind first they flee, &amp; glad w? sounds their ioy proclames. But these to Rutil king, and Latin lords great meruels were, Till toward shore they loke, than fleetes arriuing bustling there They saw, and vnder ships the seas all couered shew no where. His topright crest it burnes, and flame forth sparkling hie from head Outbelching spouts forth beames, his goldbright shield fire perbrakes read None otherwise, than whan by nighttime nesh som blasing star All bloodred sanguine shewes, and louring lookes on men from far. He not for creatures welth, but sores, &amp; droughts, and sicknes straunge Doth spring, &amp; sad with frowning soure due light fr? skies doth cha?g. But not from Turnus bold did corage ought or hope remoue To fend them loose from land, or from the shore with force to shoue. He cheres their sprites which speech, and of him self to his men doth cry. That ye haue long desired, lo here it is with swords to try, Euen to your hands is Mars descended syrs, let ech man needes Now thinke on wife, on house, your liues, your lands, y? valiant deedes And honour of your auncetours, encountre them at land Whilst fearful they come forth, and their first steps do sag in sand. Fortune is freend to venturers, and cowards hateth most. When this was said: he doth deuise who shal defend the coast, And who shall still the Troian wals besiege with armed hoast. Therwhiles Aeneas from his lofty ships his mates to shore By planks conueyes, but diuerse stay till flood the sea restore. Duke Tarchon.And some by letters short, to set them selues to land apply, And some by Ores. Tarchon, the coast along doth searching try, Where he ne foord doth finde, ne noyse of broken surges heares. But when the calmed sea to swell by force of tyde appeares, He quickly wendes his ship, and to his mates request doth make. O chosen crue, now to your sturdy Ores your selues betake. Hallawe, set forth your ships, and with the beakes cleaue out of hand This enmies shore, let weight of keele turne vp, and cut the land. My self do not refuse in such a rode my ship to breake, If once the shore I might obtayne. These words no sooner speake Did Tarchon, but his mates arise in Ores, tyll Latine ground The foming ships do touch &amp; keeles echwhere dryland haue found. Their beaks do beat the brinke, &amp; sand with earth theron they sound. Where all in salftie syt, saue barke, O Tarchon thine, alone. For whilst on sand it smites, and strikes on banks of beach and stone, Uncerten on which side to fall, and surges sore it beates, It splits in twaine, and men in midst of waues, and water weates. Whom hatches, broken Ores, and fleeting sliues of boord, and beame Do stay, and ebbe pulles backe their feete againe into the streame. Ne Turnus sluggish slouth doth stay, but fierce with speede he bends Gainst Troians all his power, and on the shore afront them tends. They blowe alarme. Aeneas first the rusticke sort sets on For happy hansils sake, and Latines layes the ground vpon. Where Theron tooke his bane, the mightiest man in all the field That set vpon Aeneas, whom with sword through brasen shield, Theron slayne. And through his golden plated Iacke he thrust into the side. Then Lycas next, from mothers wombe cut forth wherof she died, Anoured Phœbe, to thee, who might in youth haue shund before Lycas. Warres doubtful haps, and Cissee hard, not pausing enymore, With cruell Gias, who with clubs the rancks to ground did beare, He sent to death: nought Hercles armes which they in fight did weare, Nought might their valient hands, nor sier Melampus helpe that was Alcides mate, whilst he on earth his trauailes great did passe. To Pharon loe, with boasting talke which doth him self aduance, Into his gaping mouth his hugie dart he threw by chance. And thou likewise, with yellow tendre downe on cheekes in prime O Cydon whilst syr Clitie thou pursuest in luckles time, By Troian hand yslaine, quite carelesse of thy wonted loue To boyes still borne, poore wretch, the force of death wast like to proue, Had not a troope of brothers rescued thee, sir Phorcus seede, Who seuen in number were, and darts they seuen did cast indeede, Wherof some from his shyeld, some from his helmet backe do flye All voyde, and Venus noble dame directeth some awrye As they were throwne. Aeneas then to good Achates spake. He hartneth him self by rem?brance of former prowesse. Reach mee my dartes (for none in vaine with righthand he did shake Against the Rutils) which sumtime in Grætian bodies ran In Troian fields: a mighty speare he ketcheth quickly than And throwes it foorth, which flying strikes of Mœons shield the brasse, And percing through, with brest plate strong, into his breast doth passe. To whom Alcanor steps, and downe his brother falling stayes Up with his hand, through whose arme streight y? speare flies forth his waies, And all with blood imbrued his course he keepes yet stil amain, The arme from shoulder hanging stays by synewes one or twaine. Then Numitor from out his brothers corps doth pull the dart, But lawfull tys not sure like wound on him againe t'impart, Achates wounded in y? thighThere through Achates thighe he forced it, and foorth it flies. Then Lausus stout of lim, and trusting speares him thither hies, Where Driopis with sturdy lance full sore he strikes from far Right vnderneth the chyn, the bloody wound his throat doth mar, And with one blow, of language both and lyfe him reeues, that hee With forhead beats the ground, and blacke blood spues that all may see. And three likewise in Thracy borne in farthest northern coast, Three also which of Idas sier, and Ismare soyle might boast, By diuerse meanes he throwes to ground. Halesus in that space Comes on into Aruncas hands, and of Neptunus race Sprongfoorth Messapus braue with steeds, now these, now they do striue In very brinke of Latine land ech other thence to driue. Lyke as contrary winds amid the aier that roue about Do striue among them selues, with equall force, and courage stout, Not one to others power, not cloudes, nor seas do yeld a whit, The battell doubtfull hangs, ech thing aduerse so close doth sit. Noneotherwise the Troian bands, and Latin ranks they ran Togither, setling foote to foote, and thronging man to man. On tother side, where as the streame of peablestones great store Togither rouled had, and thrown downe trees vpon the shore, The Archadians put to flight.Th'Archadian band whose wont was not on foote their force to trie, When Pallas saw to Latines turne theyr backs, and fast to flie, Whom sharpnes of the place had forst from horses to alight, The last, and only shift which serues for men in such a plight, With prayers oft, and oft with taunts hee them prouokes to fight. O whyther fly ye mates? now by your selues, and deeds of might, And by your prince Euanders name, and battels won or this, And by my hope which match vnto your countrey prayses is, Trust not vnto your feete, through midst of foes a way we must Breake forth, where now the thickest rout of foes vpon vs thrust. This way both ye, and Pallas, and your natiue soyle requests. No gods against vs fight, tis mortall foe that vs molests Mortall like vs, as many soules, and hands we haue as thay. Behold, we are beset by mighty sea that stops our way, By land we can not flie, shall we to Troy by sea againe? This said: into the thickst of all his foes he thrusts amaine. And first by cruell destnies thither brought he meeteth streight Pallas slaughters after his exhortacion. With Lagus, whom whilst he pluckes at a stone of hugy weight, With bended weapon sticks, in myddle space the rybs betweene As backbone would permit, and foorth he pulles the speare ageene Earst sticking in the bones, on whom sir Hisbon falles not iust Though hoping so to do, for whilst in rage to ground he rusht Unwares of fellowes chance, with cruell death him Pallas slewe, And soone his mighty sword quite through his swelling lunges he drue. At Helene next he goes, of Rhœts eke auncient stocke ofspred Anchemolus, that durst with incest straine his stepdames bed. And yee likewise O Twinnes, your fall in Rutil fields yee tooke Of Daucie impes, Larid, and Tymber, who most like did looke, And scarse could be discernd, to parents kinde a sweete deceat. But Pallas now, vnto you both hath giuen a diffrence great. Larid and Tymber sleyne. For why O Tymber, thy head off, Euanders sword did streeke. Thy righthand Larid, once chopt of, thy corpse doth forthwith seeke, And fingers halfe a liue do mooue, and weapons downe let fall. Th'Arcadians thus hartned on, and viewing therwithall His valient deedes, both greefe, and shame do them to battell call. Then Pallas soone sir Rhoetee which in charret fled him bie Through girdes, and tarience like he giues to Ilus or he die. For he at Ilus did from far direct a mighty dart, On Rhoetee which, (betweene that came) did light, and strake his hart, Whiles Teuthra thee, and brother Tyren thine he flies, and reeles Downe from his charret, beating Rutil ground with both his heeles. And like a wisshedly when winds in sommer season blowe, The sheepheard doth his fiers in diuers parts of woods bestow, Which quickly taking hold, togither ioyntly run apace Through largest fields, sir Vulcans power doth take his cruell race. He lyke a conquerour his fires doth sitting looke vpon: None otherwise their fellowes force togither meets in one, Which Pallas, thee delights. And stout Halesus fierce in field Sticks such as do withstand, and close defends him self with shield. He Ladon sleys, and Pheretus, and Domodocus quite, Strimonies righthand eke he soone strikes of, with sword full bright Raught to his throat, and Thoas face he batters with a stone, And goary bloodly braines together dashes with the bone. The father telling things to come, in woods Halesus hid, But when to auncient fier, colde death his vitall twyne vndid, Destnies.The destnies hands layd on his threede, and him bequeathed thay Unto Euanders armes, whom Pallas meeting first doth pray. Graunt father Tyber to this Dart, which here in hand I rest, Good fortune, and a redie way into Halesus breast. This armour, and the spoyles of this the man thine Oke shall haue. The god did graunt. Halesus whilst Imaons spoyles would saue, Couetousnes cast him away.Unhappely his bared breast yeelds to Archadian steele, But Lausus, at so worthy a persons death lets nere adeele His rankes to feare, him selfe the greatest part of war, and right Agaynst him Abas sleyes, the force and stay of all the fight. Downe falles th'Arcadian brood to ground, Hetruscan youth is slayne, And you O Troians of the Greekes vnhurt, there take your bayne. The rankes togither run, with captaines match, and equall might, The rerwards fast approch, so that the throng in midst of fight Comparison betweene Pallas, and Lausus.Ne weapons weld, ne hands can moue, Pallas sore vrgeth here, There Lausus, youthes, that very much of semblant age appeare, Of passing beauty both, to whom fell fortune had denide Their countries more to see, and Ioue that all the world doth guide Would not consent that they together meete their force to trie, But vnto ech their chaunce remaines through greater foe to die. Iuturna sister to Turnus.Therwhile Iuturna fayer, her brother Turnus puts in mind To rescue Lausus, he through midst of routs flies swift as wind. When he beheld his mates, leaue of from fight, he saies, anone, My selfe will Pallas match, for Pallas vnto me alone Belongs, whose father present here I wish his chance to view. This said, his mates thus chargd, w? speed themselues fr? field w?drew. At Rutils quicke departure thence, and charge so full of pride, The youth much wondring, stoind at Turnus stands, &amp; eyes doth glide His mighty corps vpon, and fierce ech thing he doth behold, And thus replies vnto the king with woords, and courage bold. For princely spoiles I either praise will gayne, well woon in fight, Or for a noble death, my sier esteemes of both aright, Leaue of thy threats he said, and foorth proceedes amidst the playne, A chilly colde th'Arcadians harts do feele through euery vayne. From charret Turnus leapes, and foorth on foote he drawes him nie. Like as a Lyon fierce, when on a mount he stands on hie, And spies from far in fields a bull prepare him selfe to fight, He thither hies, such was the looke of Turnus comming, right. Whom when he thinkes within the reach of his darts cast to bee, Then Pallas first drew neare, good fortunes ayde at neede to see, Although in strength not match, and thus to loftie skies he said. By gestred at my fathers house; and tables vnto thee laid Alcides, I thee pray, good fortune to my purpose giue, Halfe dead that he may see me of his armour him beriue, And Turnus or he die behold me stoutly win the feeld. Alcides heard the youth, and from his hart within doth yeeld A wofull greeuous grone, and frustrate teares lets fall amaine. Then Ioue with freendly words his sonne recomforts thus againe. Ech mans day stands prefixt, time short, and swift with curelesse bretch Is lotted all mankind, but by their deeds their fame to stretch, That priueledge vertue giues. Under the lofty walles of Troy Full many sonnes of gods were sleyne, yea Sarpedons anoy My childes was there ywrought. Turnus likewise his destnies call, And to his fixed terme of graunted lyfe run forth he shall. This much he said, and straight his eyes to Rutil fields downe bends. And Pallas then with mighty force an hugie speare forth sends, And glittring sturdy sword from hollow scabbard out doth pull. That flies, and where the armour on his shoulders rises, full It lights, and passing forth along on brym of bucklar bright At length it doth on part of Turnus hugie body light. Then Turnus, aiming long in hand a dart of sturdy Oke Well typt with steele, at Pallas forth it flung, and thus he spoke. Loe, see if that our dart he sharper then thy weapon was. He sayd: and through so many lynings forgde of iron, and brasse, And through so many folds of hydes of bulles there laid about, The whirling head through shield at one blow beats a passadge out, And gorgets force through gyrds, and glides into his mighty brest. In vaine the warmed dart he from the wound doth quickly wrest, For by the self same way both blood, and soule their passedge take. He falles vpon the wound, his armour falling noyse doth make, Pallas is sleyne.And dying, with his blooddy face falles on his enmies ground. On whom thus Turnus sitting, sayes. Ye Archades, (? he) these words see faithfully ye tell Euander kinge, I send his sun as he deserueth well. What honour of the graue, what comfort is at buriall most I graunt, no litle price Aeneas harbour him shall cost. He said, and then anon his lift foote to the corps he reight Starke dead, and quickly pluckes away his belt of hugie weight, The stori of Danaides that slew their husb?ds. An admonition not to be puft vp in prosperitie.With this foule fact therin exprest, how on the wedding night, A troupe of youthes were sleyne, and beds embrued with bloody spight. Which good Eurytion did somtime engraue in massie gold, This booty Turnus vaunts him of, and ioyes he doth it hold. Unskilfull is mans minde of chance to come, and future fate, And knowes no meane to keepe, once raysd a loft in happy state. To Turnus time shall come, when he shall wish he dearly bought That Pallas were vntoucht, these spoyles, and very day in thought Shall hate. His mates with wofull dole, and bitter teares him lay Upon a shield, and Pallas thence they carie thicke away. O greefe, and honour great that to the father wil remaine, This day thee first brought to the wars, this tooke thee thence again. Yet doost thou leaue behinde thee hugie heapes of Rutils slaine. By this time had no vayne report hereof, but trusty poast In hast vnto Aeneas told, in what distresse his hoast Aeneas waxeth wood for the death of Pallas.Did stand; that time it was his vanquisht Troians for so ayd. Ech thing him next he mowes to ground, and foorth a way he layd Cut with his sword amid the ranks, thee Turnus proude to finde For slaughter new, Pallas, Euander eke he beares in minde, And still in sight they stand, and tables which in gestred wise He first approcht, and righthands ioynd, and there anon hee spies Foure valient youthes at Sulmo borne, and foure which Vfens bred, Whom thence he hales aliue, and offreth vp vnto the dead, And burning bonefier flambes he all bedewes with captiue blood. At Mago next a whirling speare he threw a far that stood, But stouping he escapes, the quiuering dart foorth flies his waies. Then suppliant on the ground his knees embracing thus he praies. Now by thy fathers ghoste, and if Iulus hope to thee Bee deere, preserue this wretched life both to my sonne, and mee. An haultie house I haue, wherin there lie deepe hid in ground Great summes of siluer coyne, of gold likewise full many a pound Aeneas is t?pted w? mony, but nothing could appease him after than Pallas was sleyne. Some formed, and some not, in mee ne Troiane conquest lyes My selly life in no respect so great aduentures tryes. He said, to whom Aeneas thus replies with words full fell. These summes of siluer, and of golde wherof thou late didst tell, Keepe for thy children, Turnus first these customes tooke away Of war, when he erewhiles in cruelwise did Pallas slay, This doth Anchises soule, this doth Iulus vnderstand. And speaking thus, his helmet fast he roughly raught with hand, And bended downe his necke by force, and treating still for life Into his throat he thrust vp to the hylt his fatall knife. Mago is sleyne. Not far from thence, Aemonides, to Phœbe, and Diane preest, Whose head with myter bound, and sacred stoales was brauely dreest, All glittring in attire, and well beseene in armour gay, Him meeting, out the field doth chase, and on him felde doth stay, Whom offring vp he couers with his shade. Serestus takes The armour vp, wherof to thee a trophey, Mars, he makes. The ranks do then restore sproong forth of Vulcanes noble seede Syr Cœculus, and Vmbro, sproonge from Marsi hilles indeede. Gainst whom Aeneas stands in rage, and soone stricks of to ground Anxures left arme and therwith falles to earth his bucklar round. The same some loftie words had spoke, and those he firmly thaught In time should take effect, his minde perhaps to heauen he raught, And promist to him selfe hoare heares, and race of many yeares. Syr Tarquitus on th'other side, that braue in armes appeares, Whom Driope Nimphe sumtime had borne to Faunus siluane god, With him thus raging meetes, who with his lance in length full od His brestplate, and his shield of hugie weight he breakes in twaine, And strait his head, that now begins to pray, but all in vaine He swaps to earth, and downe to ground the corps yet warme he kest, Wheron he stoutly stoode, and thus he spake with hatefull brest. O terrible lye there, thy noble mother shall not haue Thy corps for to entumbe, nor lay thy bones in natiue graue. To foules thou shalt be left, or surging sea shall beare away Thee to the hungry fish, a very sweete, and deyntie pray. Antæus, and syr Lycas eke, king Turnus vowards, hee Pursueth strait, with Numa strong, and browne Camertes thee Of valient Volscens borne, most ritch of ground in Latino land Amicli, men of few words.Of all that were, and whist Amicles scepter held in hand. Lyke as Briareus, that an hundred armes had, as men say, An hundred hands likewise and fiftie mouthes wherwith alway Fier from his brest he spet, when Ioue against him lightning threw, So many bucklars vp he held, so many swords he drew. None otherwise Aeneas victour chafes, the field about, When once his sword waxt warme, but loe against Niphœus stout, His charret horse against, and gainst his breast his course he tooke. But when the horses spied him comming far with egre looke, For feare they do retyre, and foundring backward downe full sore They throw their lord to ground, and draw the charret to the shore. In charret drawne with milkewhite steeds comes riding in that tide Syr Lucagus, with Liger that his brothers horse doth guide. There Lucagus full fierce his naked sword about doth glide. Aeneas then no longer could their frantike rage forbeare, But to them hies, and vp in sight doth hold an hugie speare. To whom thus Liger speakes. Not Diomedes horse, nor yet Achilles charret heere Thou seest, nor the Troyan fields, of war, and life so deere Thou in this land shalt finde an end. These words of Ligers ioy Abroade slie forth at large, howbeit the noble prince of Troy, Meanes not with wordes to wage but forth a dart at him he kest, As Lucagus downe stoupes to fetch his stroke with weapon prest, And forth his horse doth beat, and liftfoote quickly putting out Prepares him self to fight, the lance by th'utmost brim about Of glittring shield slides by, and way into his flancke it found. He beaten from his charret falles halfe dead vnto the ground. To whom then good Aeneas prince with bitter language sayes. O Lucagus, it is no slouth of horse that thee betrayes, Ne yet no ghost, nor dreadful shape of foes enforst thee flye, For thou thy selfe thy charret leftst, downe leaping from on hie. This said: the charret raignes he takes, the other brother cries, And holding vp his hands on earth falne from the charret lyes. Now by thy selfe, and parents which thee bred so worthy a wight, Syr Troyan spare my life (I pray) from dreadfull deathes despight. And praying more, Aeneas thus replies. Such words of late Thou didst not speake, now die, and ioyntly tast thy brothers fate. The harbour of his soule, his brest forthwith he perst with blade, And many a valiant slaughter more about the field he made The Troian duke when here, and there he ran in furious wise, Much like a rumming streame, or when a whirlewine black doth rise. Ascanius yong at length comes forth abroad into the playne With al the youth, and tentes they leaue that were besieydge in vaine. Then Iupiter therwhils, to Iuno speaking thus he bowes. Iupiter to Iuno. O sister myne, and eke the same to me most louing spouse, As thou didst thinke, dame Venus (for deceaud thou art not sure) The Troians welth sustaynes, els warres they might not thus endure. In hands no force, in harts no might they haue, no paynes abide They coulde, vnlesse sum heauenly weight did them support, and guide. To whom thus Iuno lowly then, most fayerest lord, and kinge. Why dost thou greeue me stil, &amp; aye w? words great dreading bring? Iunos reply. Such force in loue as I haue had in yore, or ought to haue If now I had thou shouldst not sticke to graunt that I do craue, Almightie since thou art, both Turnus now from fight to take, And him for euer false to auncient Daunus sier to make. Howbeit let him dye, and yeld his blood to Troyans hands. Yet in direct discent of kinde of gods he rightly stands. Pilumnus fouerth is from his syer, thy temples largly hee With gifts adorned hath, which furnisht wel with presents bee. To whom Olimpus heauenly king againe this aunswer gaue. If stay of present death, or tyme for mortal youth you craue. Which so you thinke I may determe, take Turnus then away, And do by flight, his dangers prest which destnies threat, delay. So longe I am content to lyue, but if you farther craue, By subtile treatie sure redresse of al this war to haue, Or that the fates may altred be, your hope is spent in vaine. To whom then Iuno whining ripe, In word which you no dayne, What if you that in hart would graunt, and Turnus life prolonge? But giltlesse now an heauie end him bides, or would I wrong Did iudge, and O with neadlesse feare I were deceaued quite, And thou which canst, these thinges a newe woldst turne to better ryte. When she these words had said, fr? heauen on hie she down descends, Iuno lady of storms &amp; clouds. And with her brings a winter storme, and cloudes about her bends, And to the Troyan host, and Laurent tents she fast doth hie. And there an hollow cloud, a forcelesse shadow, by and by, Much like Aeneas shape (a thinge most strange, and rare to see) In Troian armes she frames, his hugie shield, and creast doth shee Unto his head deuine in semblant fit, and gloasing talke, And sound without a minde, and feines his gate as he did walke, Such one as fame reports dead shapes of men departed flie. Or like to dreames that do delude such as in sleepe do lie. This shadow brauely stands, and vaunts it forth the ranks before, And Turnus still with weapons egs, and tempts with language sore. To whom then Turnus steps, and at it soone he foorth doth cast A whirling dart, that turnes the back, and thence it flies in hast. When Turnus then supposd Aeneas fled him fast away, Much troubled then in minde, vaine hope conceauing, thus gan say. Aeneas where away? do not thy promist wife forsake, This hand to thee the land, which long by sea thou soughts, shall take. Thus crying fast he followes on, with fauchon redy bent In hand, ne spies how these his ioyes with wind away they went. By chance there rode a ship, fast ioyned to a rocky ridge, With ladders lying foorth, and plancks prepard a ready bridge, In which Osinius king, from Clusium citie thither came. Aeneas flying shape strait thither hies, and in the same It selfe doth shrowd, and Turnus after hies him self apace, And lingring none he makes, but bridges hie doth ouertrace. Who scarce the ship had toucht, but Iuno strait the cable brake, And lainsht the ship from shore, and did to boistrous sea betake. Him now Aeneas absent much in battell seekes, and sends The bodies of the Rutil youthes vnto their fatall ends. No lenger then this sensles shape in corners seekes to lye, But strait aloft doth mount, and to the darkned cloud doth flye. Therwhiles into the midst of seas the whirlwind Turnus brings, Both thanklesse for his lyfe, and quite vnwares of all these things, And both his folded armes with these words vp to heauen he flings. Almightie Ioue, and doost thou iudge so much I do offend, Turnus c?plaint for breech of estemacion.This punishment on mee, which same haue not deserud, to send? O where, or whence go I? what flight? or whom shall it restore? Shall I againe Laurentum walles, or tents see enymore? Or els those men which mee, and eke my quarrell ayded haue? Whom all (alas) I now haue left vnto their death, and graue. And now I see them stragling quite, and heare their wofull cries As they be sleyne, what shall I doo? what earth may now suffice My corps with gaping to receaue? you windes some pitie take, Gainst rockes (for willing Turnus I to you my prayers make) Do strike my ship, or beare me hence where cruelst quicksands bee, Where neuer Rutil wight, ne yet report may follow mee. Thus speaking, in his minde to this, sumtime to that he flyts, The present shame for to auoyd, like one distract of wits Where it were best his naked sword betweene his ribs to driue, Or cast him self amid the floods, so to returne aliue, By swimming to the crooked shore, vnto the Troyane fight, Thrise whilst both wayes he did attempt, thryse Iuno full of might With held him, and with pitie moued his purpose did restraine. He driues vpon the sea, with happy streame, and tyde amaine, At last arriues at auncient towne where Daunus king doth raigne. Therwhiles, at becke of mighty Ioue, Mezentius burning mad Mezentius cometh to battle. Into the battle comes, and sets vpon the Troyans glad. The Troyan bandes togither run, and with one hate they fall On him alone, and with their darts they do assaile him all. He like a mighty rocke, amid the seas aloft that lies With all aduentures meetes, and fretting rage of surge abies, And forces all sustaines, what so by heauen, or sea are done That firmly fixed stands. Sir Hebrus Delicaons sonne He throwes to ground, and Latagus, and Palmus swift in flight. At Latagus an hugie fragment of a mount in fight He raught, and strake him in the face, and Palmus ham he riues In twaine, and lets him softly roule, and armes to Lausus giues, Who same vpon his shoulders fits, and plume on helmet weares. Euantes eke the Troyan borne, and Minas match in yeares To Paris, and companion his, Theano whom the same Unto his sier Amicus bare, when noble Hecube dame A burning brond sir Paris brought to light, he found a graue Within Troy towne, but Minas thee Laurentum fields now haue. Like as the Bore, which from the hils the hounds bring down in chase, Whom Vesule pinie mount hath fostred well a mighty space, And Laurent fields in couert deape of reeds full long haue fed, At length when he him selfe perceaues in tangling toyles bespred Still stands, and fiercely whets his tusks, and bristels vp doth set, Ne courage any to be wroth, or neare to come doth let. With borespeares flung from far, &amp; hallowings loud the beast they tyre Euen so all those gainst whom Mezentius stout hath cause of ire, None hath the hart in equall fight to meete him hand to hand, But throwing darts, and raising hugie noyse, aloofe they stand. He fearlesse lookes about, and doubts which way his course to make, And gnashes with his teeth, and on his backe their darts doth take. From auncient coasts of Coritus, a Grætian Acron hight There came, who promist wife, and wedding had forsane by flight. Whom when Mezentius sees, amyd the rankes moue stur, and strife In purple plumes full braue, and scarlet weede of promist wife: Like as an hungry lyon fierce the forest round doth praunce, (So hunger mad constraines) if he a rowebucke swift by chaunce, Or els a Sore may find, whose tendre hornes begin to ryse, He rampes for ioy, and wide he gapes, and vp his brestles flyes, And falles vpon him close, and strait he bathes in goary blood His greedy iawes: Mezentius so him hies against his foes in hasty mood. Acron slaine.Unhappy Acron falles to ground, and earth with heeles doth beate, Whilst vp he yelds the gost, and speare not burst with blood doth weate, Ne sir Orodes would he dayne, that thence apace did flie To cast to ground, ne at his backe his trembling dart to wrie, But full in face him meetes, and man for man with him doth fight, Inferiour in craft, but not in deedes of martiall might. On him then prostrate on the earth both setting foote, and speare, Of war no porcion small, loe tall Orodes lyeth there. His mates againe a dubled sound sendforth with ioyfull hart. He dying speakes, sure vnreuengd my death what euer thou art Thou shalt not finde, ne long enioy, like destnies thee do call, And where I lie, these very fields shal see thy fatall fall. To whom Mezentius smiling, mixt with anger, answered then. Thou now shalt die, as touching mee, the father of gods, and men Looke he to that, and with that word the speare from corps he drew. Unto his eyes doth bitter rest, and deadly sleepe ensue, With aye enduring night, and neuer more the day to view. Then Cædicus Alcathous sleies, Hidaspis eke at length Is by Sacrator sleyne, Parthenie eke by Rapo, in strength Right rough likewise hee Orses, and Messapus reeues of breath Sir Clonie strong, Ericate Lycaon sends to death, Who now by fall of frantike iade lies on the ground, the tother A footeman him now sleyes on foote, and who from Argos thither Sir Lycius came him gainst of grandsiers force not frustrate quight, Braue Valerus downe throwes sir Sale Antronius killes in fight, And him Nealces sleyes, in casting dartes of noble skill, That could from very far strike with an arrow what he will. The greeuous fight like sorowes now, &amp; mutual deaths had wraught, Ech others slew, and they them selues were soone to slaughter braught, Both conquerours and conquerd sort, ne these will flie, ne thay. The Gods from Ioues supernall court their bootlesse wrath do way, And pitie on both parts do take, and mortals heauy plight. On th'oneside Venus fayer lookes downe, on th'other Iuno bright And pale Tisiphon fretting fumes in thickst amid the fight. Mezentius fierce a mighty dart then shaking in his hand, Tisiphone which signifieth desier of reuenge. Comes flying to the field, much like Orion great from land When he on foote through midst of deepest seas and surges walkes, And cuts a way through lakes, and to the necke in waters stalkes. Or when an auncient Oke from highest hilles he home doth fetch, And walking on the ground with lofty head the cloudes doth retch. Mezentius so right fierce in monstrous armour in comes hee. Aeneas straight when him within the rankes afar doth see, Prepares against to goe, but he awhit not dreading staies, Untill his foe approch, his mighty corps he there do paies. And measuring with eye the space how far his dart could glide, This righthand this of mine, and flying launce which here I guide, Be happy God to me I pray, and here a vow I make, The spoyles which now from of the corps of this same theefe I take Thou for a monument, shalt Lausus haue, that sayd, a launce He straight casts foorth, that flies, and from Aeneas shield did glaunce And worthy Anthor strake, and twixt his ribs and guts it went. Anthor to sir Alcides mate, that was from Argos sent, And to Euander claue, and auncient Itayle towne possest, With others wound vnhaply slaine his face to heauen he kest, And yeelding vp the ghost, sweete Argos oft doth call to minde. Aeneas then a dart doth cast, that flies as swift as winde. And where the hollow bosse about with threefold plates of bras, With linen strong, and threefold playtes of bulles hide couered was, The whirling dart through slies, and in his flanke doth fiercely light, No force might it withstand. He gladly drawes his fauchon bright Huge hanging downe his side, when Tyrrhen blood he doth espie, And to him trembling all in rage he quickly draweth nie. Then Lausus for his fathers chaunce doth mone in piteouswise When hee the deed beheld, and plenty teares ran downe his eyes. This hatefull hap of death, and eke those valient factes of thine, (Yf therto later Time to credite giue do not repine) Thy passing deedes, O noble Youth, in silence shal not lye. Mezentius hurt retires, and back vnweldy fast doth hye. And with his shield his enmies speare away with him he drew. The sun came to rescue the father.Forth Lausus sprang, and strait him selfe amid the weapons threw, And now his righthand vp he cast, his mighty stroke he fet, When vnderneath Aeneas sword the stroke doth cumming let. Their mates with mighty noyse, and shout, this worthy deede pursue. Then hid with Lausus shield the father him self from thence withdrue, And darts they thicke do throw, and foes from far prouoke to fight. Aeneas raging frets, and shields him self with bucklar bright. And like as when a cloud, fulfraught with hayle to ground doth fall, The ploughmen rough from out the fields with speede convey them all, The husbandmen thence hie, the waifairer some harbour takes, Some riuers bancke, or hollow stony cliffe his succour makes Whilst downe it poures, that when the Sun returnes againe in sight, To woonted traueill fall, and labour lately left they might. So stands Aeneas still, on ech side sore with tooles opprest, On him whilst thick this cloud of war, and ragyng all doth rest, And Lausus then begins to checke, and Lausus thus to threat. Where desperat runst? &amp; doost attempt things for thy power to great? This foolish loue of thine hath thee vnskilfull quite forlorne. And he likewise against his foe, no lesse doth brag, and skorne. Unto the Troyan prince great fury now in breast doth raigne, And destnies had the vitall threed of Lausus cut in twaine, For through his bulck Aeneas soone his mighty fauchon draue, And hid it in him whole, his shield, and armour all he claue, His coate likewise his mother which of soft fine gold had knit Aeneas pitieth him, for he resembled Anchises faceAnd fild his bosome full of blood, his life away doth flit, And wofull hasting to the soules, his body leaues behinde, But when he saw his face which now to gastly death resignd, His face which pale in wondrous sort did looke, he wofull stands, And heauily bewailing vp with griefe doth cast his hands, The semblant deape of fathers loue comes eft into his mind. What praises due O youth, shall I for these thy merites find? What may Aeneas worke so worthy nature to requite? Thine armour keepe, wherin alwayes thou tookest most delyte, Thy soule vnto thy grandsiers gosts, thine ashes to the graue I send, if so thy freends herof some due regarde will haue. This onething yet a comfort to thy dolefull death shalbee, That great Aeneas thee hath sleyne. His fellowes straggling hee More honorable to be slain by a noble c?queror. Much blames, and vp the corps he liftes, begoaring all with blood The curious kembed lockes, as then the finest fashion stood. Therwhiles his father on the bancke of Tyber noble flood His woundes with water wipes, and feeble body there doth rest Against a bending tree, his brasen helmet, and his creast Farof hanges on a bough, his armour great lies on the grasse, And chosen youthes about him stand, and panting where he was His feeble necke doth ease, his beard hangs downe vpon his brest, And much of Lausus he enquires, his minde can take no rest, And many forth to him he sendes from fight him to recall, And of his fathers carefull hart him to enforme withall. Then Lausus dead his mates bring home with greefe and dubled paine, Lamenting sore so mighty a man, so mighty a wound had slaine. The minde that mischiefe did abode, his sun afar did know, Mezentius lamentation for Lausus death. His hoary heares with filthy dust he daubes, and vp doth throw Both hands vnto the heauens, and fast vnto the corps doth cleaue. O sun, had I such lust here still to liue, ne life to leaue That I should thee to cruell enmies rage obiected see, Whom I begat? and with thy blood preserued aliue to bee, Thus liuing by the death? To mee poore wretch doth nought remaine Saue exile sharpe, this bitter wound my wofull hart hath slayne. And I (my sun) thy noble name with foule reproch haue staind, Pulst forth through spite fr? princely throne, &amp; place wher father raind Due punishment haue wel deserud, at countreis hands to die All kindes of death, which (but to glose) I cannot sure denie. Howbeit, as yet, I liue, ne men, ne light I do forsake, But shortly so will do, and with that word he doth betake Him to his wounded thigh, wheron he stands in painful case, The deaply stroken wound doth cause him much to slack his pace. But nought in courage quaild for steede he calles, his only stay, And only comfort still that was, wherby he went away He speaketh to his horse.Still conquerour from field, and to his steede thus gan to call. O Rhœbus, long (if ought to mortall men be long at all) We liued haue, this day with blooddy spoyles returne agayne, Or with Aeneas head thou shalt, and so of Lausus payne Reuenger be with mee, or els if force no way can finde With mee togither shalt be slaine, since then of valient kinde, Canst not abide (I thinke) a straunge, or Troian lord to know. This said: vpon the woonted backe himselfe he doth bestow, And eche hand strait he armes with deadly dart, and pearsing speare, The brasen helmet glittring shines, and creast of horses heare, And swift he throngs into the thickst, great shame his hart doth freat Deepe lodgde within, and madnesse mixt in breast, with sorow great, And loue incenst with rage, and priuie touche of enmies might. Then thrise Aeneas there with mighty noyse he calles to fight. Aeneas knew his voyce, and glad in minde began to pray, The king of Gods, Apollo eke do graunt thou say not nay, To deale with mee in fight. This much he said, and with an hugie speare him straight doth meete. To whom then hee, O cruell wretch with threats why doost thou greete Since thou my Sun hast slayne? this was the next, and only way For thee to frame my fatall fall, and weaue my last decay. No loue to lothsome light I beare, for life I do not care, Nor is there any of the Gods whom I regard, or spare, He regardeth not the gods.Leaue of, I come to die, but first this gift to thee I bring. He said: and strait a quiueringe dart against his foe doth fling. Then forth another, and another throwing, round doth ride A mighty race, the golden shield can well their force abide. And thrise the Carrire round about him standing in the fielde In casting forth his dartes he rode, the Troian lord his shielde Thrise beareth round, with cruell wood of dartes quite ouerspred. But when he shames so long to stay, so many a sticking head For he on foot, fought against an Horsman. Mezentius falleth.To pull away, and neede compels vnequall fight to try, And foes incensed rage, aye bent to blood, and death doth spie, Much casting in his minde, at last breakes forth, and doth enforce A dart into the hollow temples of the warlike horse. Upstandes the steede on end, and beates the aier his heeles withall, Then downe he tumbling turnes, and faultring on the man doth fall. He groueling on his face with shoulder wrest from ioynt there lies. The Troyans, and the Latines eke with clamour touch the skies. Aeneas flying comes, and from the sheath his blade drawes out, And thus he speakes. Where is I pray you now Mezentius stout? Where now that cruell force of minde, and courage bold in fight? To whom Mezentius, when he larger breath, and heauens sight Had drawne, and daunted sprites began refreshed well to bee, O bitter foe, why bragst thou thus, and threatnest death to mee? By slaughter is no wrong ywrought, ne came I so to fight, Ne did for mee my Lausus deare such league, or bargaine smyte. This one thing I request, of lordes if vassayles grace may craue, My body let entombed be, I wote my subiectes haue Great hatred mee against, their rage defend from me away, And do vouchsafe in one self graue, my sun, and mee to lay. He spake: and strait the sword aduisde into his throat receaues, And gushing goary blood the life amid his armour leaues. DEO GRATIAS. Inchoatum per Thomam Phaer, finitum Londini per Thomam Twynum. 23. Maij. 1573. Opus 7. dierum per interualla. THE ELEVENTH BOOKE of the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. Conquerour Aeneas setteth vp a monum?t to Mars for Mezentius slayne. Pallas corps is with great pompe sent to Euanders towne. Embassadours are dispatched from Latinus, to intreat for truce of twelue dayes, during which time they yeld the dutie of sepulture to their dead, on both parts. And this while Venulus that was sent at the beginning of y? war, to require ayd of Diomedes: returneth with denyal. Then Latinus destitute of hope calleth a counsell, and consulteth to send Embassadours to Aeneas with conditions of peace. Drances &amp; Turnus vpon aunci?t hatred inueigh one at the other. Therwhiles Aeneas deuiding his armie in twaine: sendeth his light horsemen before directly to the towne: And he himselfe, with the rest of his power, marcheth through woods, &amp; ouer hilles towards the hiest part of y? towne, which being once knowne within Laurentum towne, they leaue the counsell, &amp; prepare such things as are necessary for resist?ce. Then Turnus vnderst?ding Aeneas intent: by spies deuideth likewise his power in twaine, and giueth Messapus, and Camilla charge of the horsemen. Himselfe taketh the straites, wherthrough Aeneas must needes passe to the towne, and there lieth in ambush. The horsemen on both sides meete, and the victory is a greatwhile vncerten. There Camilla after many slaughters, whilst vnwarely she pursueth Cloreus Cybeles priest, mooued therto by the beauty of his armour: is by Aruns stroke through with a dart. Whose death neuerthelesse Aruns bare not vnreu?ged. For not long after he was stroke through likewise with an arrow, by Opis, a Nimphe of Dianas traine. The Rutilians dismaid at Camillas death: commit themselues to flight, the Troyans prepare to besiedge y? towne. These heauy tidings being told by Acca, Camillas mate vnto Turnus: leauing y? ambush he hastneth to come succour his men. Aeneas followeth after, &amp; bycause y? might drawing on, they culd not fight: both pitch their tents before y? town. The dawning day thiswhile, y? Ocean sea had cleerely left. Aeneas though some Time on those whom warres of liues had rest, Care ouer y? ded, the part of a noble Captain and of a good manHis care constraines him to employ, their graues for to prepare. And now his minde, and senses all on funerals fixed are, To gods yet nathelesse, at rising of the morning gray For conquest great obtaind, his vowes, and seruice due doth pay. A mighty Oke, whose boughes were quite shread of from euery side Upon an hill hee pight, and armour braue theron he tide, The duke Mezentius spoyles, a trophey mighty Mars to thee, And fits therto his creastes, which yet with goareblood dropping bee, And tr?che?s burst of spears, his brestplat twelue times I roughly smit And in so many thrust through, and bucklar bright of brasse doth fit To his lefthand, his blade with Iuery trimd hung downe his nick. Then there his mates (for all the troupe of lords about him thick There stoode) reioycing he exhortes and thus to them gan say. A mighty deede we ended haue, all feare expell away, Here now remaine the spoiles, and hansell of that hautie kinge, Mezentius loe here lies, whom to his death these hands did bring. Next goe vnto the king we must, and to Laurentum wall, Cheere vp your hartes to fight, and hope the war will haply fall. Let lingring none vnwares, so soone as ensignes wee assay At Gods commaundment to remoue, and youth from tentes conuay, Us hindre, or els feare from purposd fact vs hartlesse stay. Therwhiles our mates, and bodies which vnburied lie, to graue Let vs betake, this only due departed soules do craue. And go (? he) these worthy wightes which with their blood this land For you haue bought with last rewardes to honour out of hand, And to Euanders wofull towne let Pallas first be sent, Whom not deuoid of courage stoute, myshap his life hath rent, A dire, and dismold day hath drencht ful deepe in deadly lake. These thinges he weeping spake, &amp; to the place his way doth take Where Pallas body dead Acetes auncient sier did tend, That was Euanders page in youth, but not vnto the end With like goodluck alotted was companion to his sun. About him seruantes al the rout and troupes of Troians run, And doleful dames of Troy, with heare of custome quite vntrust. So soone as into loftie dores him selfe Aeneas thrust, A mighty skritch they raise vnto the skies, and breastes they beat Aeneas lamentatyon at the sight of dead Pallas. With woful cryes, and plaintes resoundes againe the pallaice great. But when he saw the head of Pallas faier held vp his face, And wound in breast so smooth, broad gapinge wide a mighty space Which Turnus la?ce had made, the trickling teares ran down his eies. And wretched lad (? hee) when lucky fortune gan to rise, Enuide she thee to mee, that thou our kingdome shouldst not see, Nor yet vnto thy fathers coastes as victour borne to bee? Not I this promise to Euander king thy sier did make, When him I parting fro, in folded armes he mee did take, And to a mighty reigne me sent, and warnd me what might fall, The men were fierce, the nation hard that I should deale withall. And now deceaued much with frustrate hope, and vaine desier, Perhaps he praiers makes, and altars heapes with blood, and fier. Unto this youth now dead, and to no goddes beholding, wee With heauy harts do honours giue that nought auailing bee. Unhappy man, thy deare sunnes wofull buriall shalt behold, These are our glad returnes, and triumphes after wars so bold, This is the trust in mee repoasd, yet sure thou shalt not see With shameful dastard woundes thy sun (Euander) sleyne to bee. Ne wish him dead whilst he did liue, O greefe, and sorow most, Now great astay Ausonia, and Iulus hast thou lost? A notable descripti? of a warlike buriall as is either of a captayne, or some noble m?.When he for all these things had wept his fill, the corps anon He bids them vp to take, and from his army many a one A thousand men in tale doth choose the funerall pompe to guide, To present be at fathers teares, some comfort to prouide Though small in his so great a griefe, which woful fathers take. Some hurdles thicke with force do frame, the coffin some do make Of tendre twisted twigs of trees, and slendre slips of Oke, And on those builded beds, with boughes thick shadowes do prouoke. Hereon the lad aloft on wad of countrey straw they lay, Much like a flower which virgins thombe from stalke hath nipt away, Where it were tendre violet, or dafdill withring white, Whose glittring hue not yet is gone, nor passing beutie bright, Though mother Tellus yeeld no sap, and strength be vaded quite. Two mantels then with purple fine, and gold that stiffe did stand Aeneas forth did bring, which once Queene Dido her one hand In happy state for him had made, with web of gold ful small. The one of these vpon the youth for honour last of all He putteth on, and lockes that must be burnt therwith doth hide. And many a worthy spoyle reserud since Laurent war beside He heapes theron, and bids the spoyles be borne in long aray, And horse, and weapons ads, which from his foes he tooke away. And certen captiues bound for sacrifice therwith he sent Unto th'infernall gods, whose blood the fiers should all besprent. And truncheons great of spears, with armour tane from foes theron, He bids the captaines beare, with foes names fastned therupon. There goes Acetes sad (good man) with store of yeares opprest, His face eft mangling with his nayles, eft bounsing of his brest. With faintnes down he falles, and corps along on earth doth rest. And charrets also forth they lead, embrued with Rutil blood. Then Aethon next, his courser fayer, bereeud of trapping stood, Aethon Pallas steede. And after weeping comes, and weates his face with mighty teares. Some beares his speare, his helmet some; the resdue Turnus weares Since him he slew, the mournfull bands of Troyans do ensue, And Tyrrhen capteynes, Archads eke, with weapons turnd ascue. But when this goodly traine afar, was marched on the way, There still Aeneas stood, and moorning wise these words gan say. The semblant woful chaunce of war doth vs from hence withcall, Of many another valient youth to wayle the wofull fall. For euermore alhayle, for euer, Pallas, now adieu, He said no more, but to the walles his steps he strait withdrue. And now Embassadours were come from Latine towne so great, With braunch of Oliue bough in hand, for licence to entreat, Such bodies as lay dead in fieldes with mortall wounds opprest For to require, that they in graues might take their finall rest. Gainst conquerd wightes, &amp; wanting breath, no fight remaines at all, His hostes that he would daine to spare, whom fathers he once did call. To whom then good Aeneas, since but iust, and rightfull thay Did aske, doth licence graunt, and more vnto them thus doth say. What fortune foule, O Latines, hath you to such warres betake, In such rash wise and foolish sort our freendship to forsake? And do you leaue, and licence now for men departed craue, Whom I do wish, that liuing they the same should rather haue? Ne had I come, but destnies here a place for vs did chuse, Nor I against your nation fight. Your king did me refuse To enterteyne, and rather claue vnto king Turnus might. For whom more equall it had byn to trie this deathes despite, If so with hand this war to end, and Troyans hence to shooue He do prepare, in armes with mee his fatall chance to prooue, Then he should liue whom gods, his life, or his righthand would spare. But now depart, and foe your peoples buriall rightes prepare. Drances was gret enemy to Turnus.These words Aeneas spake. They stood astoind, and nothing said, And ech on other glauncing oft their eyes, their mouthes they staid. The auncient then that Drances hight, for crime, and iust desart With Turnus that offended was, his wordes thus gan impart. O peerlesse prince of great renowne, in armes of greater fame, How shall I shew thy praise, or to the gods compare the same? Thy land for Iustice shall we first, or martiall feates admire? These things vnto our citie we will shew with great desire, And thee vnto Latinus king, if fortune graunt, will ioyne, Let Turnus in some other place for leagues anew purloyne. And farthermore, the hugie moale of fatall walles to reare We shalbe glad, and to that worke on shoulders stones to beare. He ended had, with one consent the same they all alow, And for twelue daies they Truce do take, and peace a space do vow. The Troyans, and the Latines mixt in woods do wandre free, And round on tops of hilles they rome, and holtes full huge that bee. And here with stroke of mighty axe the brittle ashe doth sound, There lofty Pynes that touch the stars, are throwne vnto the ground. The mighty Okes, and Ceders smelling soote the wedges teare, And sturdy Cartes do crack, full heauie lade them home that beare. Report of Pallas deth cometh to Euander, and his towne.And now the flying fame of griefe so great, and tydings ill Euander wofull man, his house, and all his towne doth fill, That Pallas late in Latium land a victour did report. Th'Archadians run vnto the gates, as is their wonted sort, And funerall brondes do beare, the wayes along echwhere do sheene With rankes of flambing fiers, and seuerals make the fields betweene. The Troyan rout approching fast do ioyne their wofull lay. Whom when the auntient Dames perceaud to court to take their way, Euanders wofull lamentacion for his sonneWith wofull cries, and piteous shoutes the towne they do repleat. No force Euander then than stay, nor reason him entreat, But forth into the thickst he thronges, and downe him self doth lay Upon the beare where Pallas was, and there doth weeping stay, And scarce vnto his speach with much adoe could ope the way. Didst not, O Pallas, thou to mee thy sier this promise make, That charely thou wouldst thy selfe to cruel war betake? I knew rightwell the nouell pride, and glory first in fight, And pleasaunt honour woon in armes how much preuaile it might. O hard beginnings to a lad, and wofull martiall trayne, My sacrifice, and praiers fond to gods powed forth in vayne. And O most holy wife and Queene, by death thrise happy thee, That hast not lieud vnto this day, this wretched sight to see. But I by seeing this, my fatall terme haue passed quite, That father yet remaine aliue, and see this wofull sight. More meete had bin the Troyan armes I followed had in feeld, And ouerwhelmd with Rutil dartes, my life to death had yeeld, And only mee this noble pompe, not Pallas home should bring. Ne can I you, O Troyans, blame, your league, no yet the thing Which we w? righthands giuen on both parts swore, when in my gro?d Most faithfull harbour, and in court you in certainment found. This chaunce vnto mine, elder yeres, I see, alotted was, But since my sun by death vntimely from this life must pas, I comfort take, the Troyans since to Latium in he braught, So many thousand Volscans sleyne, his fatall end he caught. He is glad of reuenge. Nor other funerall rytes shalt thou, fun Pallas, get of mee, Then good Aeneas, Phrygians eke, and Tyrrhenes giue to thee, Great monuments they bring of such as died by thy righthand. And thou likewise, a mighty corps now dead in armes shoulst stand, O Turnus, match if that his age, and equall strength to thine His yeres had made, so much therat I should not then repine. But why do I you Troyans now so long from battle stay? Depart, and to Aeneas king from mee this messadge say. That I this lothsome life endure, since Pallas now is dead Thy righthand is the cause, which to the fathers hoary head, And to the sun doth Turnus owe, herein thou maist deserue Alonly well of mee, and proue thy chaunce. Not to preserue The ioyes of life I seeke, ne doth mine age the same requier, But to the ghostes below to beare those newes is my desier. Them [illeg.]ing cleere therwhiles to men restored had againe The cheerfull day, that nought to them but trauailes brings, and paine. Aeneas then, and Tarchon ioynt, the crooked shore along The custome of burning the ded in olde time. Great bonefiers build, the bodies dead of all their freends the throng As cuntries custome bids do bring, and fier therunder make, The loftie heauen anon with thicke and smutchy smoke lookes blake. And thrise about the burning fiers they ran in armour bright, And thryse on horsebacke rode about the fiers with hollowing rite, And wofull wailings forth did send, and teares let fall amaine Upon their weapons, and vpon their harneis like the raine. The cry of men to heauen ascendes, and ratling Trompets sound. And some the spoyles of such as there lay sleyne of Latine ground, Their helmets fayer into the fier, and guilden swordes they threw, And bridles braue, and charret wheeles yet warme, wherof they knew, By others some cast in, their shields and weapons void of lucke, And many an oxe thernigh, they done to death, and thither plucke, And many a brestled Beare, and cattayle store the fields throughout They sley and fling them in the flames, then all the shore about Their fellowes burning they behold, and bones halfbrent do keepe, And scarce from thence can be withdrawen, till moystie night that sleepe Prouokes, the heauen inturnd, and whole with stars replenisht had. Now on the otherside in semblant sort, the Latines sad Innumerable bonefiers built, and many a body thay In graues deepe digd bestow, and many a corps they send away To neighbours nigh at hand, and to Lauinium towne againe. The resdue, and the hugie heape of such as there lay slaine Both numbrelesse, and honourlesse they burne, the fields full wide With plenty flaming fiers bright shining shew on euery side. The thirde day had from heauen nights chyllie shade expeld away, When heauely the Ashes heapes which there confused lay They buried the ashes in pots called Vrnæ.In vrnal pots they put, and smoultring mould theron do sling. And now within the walled towne of ritch Latinus king, The greatest noyse was heard, and far the wurst, and wofulst cheere, Of mothers, daughterslaw, mixt with the plaints of sisters deere, And babes bereft of fathers sweet, this cruell war detest, And Turnus promist spousals, and that he aboue the rest In single fight was sought, that he his force must trie in fight, That for Italia scepter seekes, and honours due of right. These things good auncient Drances fiercely telles, and record beeres That Turnus tis alone whom Troian prince in fight requeeres, With diuerse things besides, which many against him did dispute, Embassadours return without effecte from Diomedes.Howbeit the countnance of the Queene doth them at full refute. Though fame of many booties tane do much his name aduaunce. Then in these sturres, amid this tumult hot, by wondrous chaunce, Behold, from forth the mighty towne of Diomedes king, Embassadours with answere do returne, that they nothing With so great trauail spent, with giftes, &amp; gold to end haue brought, Nor ernest prayers tane effect, new meanes there must be wrought, Or of the Troian prince some league of peace there must be sought. With sorow great in soundings then downe falles Latinus king, And that Aeneas destnies there, and power of gods did bring The wrath of gods there shewes, and graues fresh digd before his face. Wherfore assembly great of nobles all to come in place By wrytes he warnes, and to his princely house doth them transport. The maner of callinge to a princes parlam?t. They all do meete, and to the place ech way they thicke resort. Latinus then in midst amongst them all, of auncienst yeares, With carefull countnance sits, and chiefe in hand his scepter beares. The legates there that from Ætola towne with answere came He bids declare their charge, and orderly requires the same. When whust was once proclaimd, &amp; men were bid not silence breake, Sir Venulus with duetie due, thus then began to speake. Wee Diomede, O citizens, and Argiue tentes haue seene, And dangers all we passed haue which in that Iorney beene. The Embassadors answere. And we that hand haue toucht wherby proud Troy to ground did fall. His towne he Argyripe by name of natiue soyle doth call, Which conquerour he built in Garganus Iapix land. When in we came, and leaue we had to speake where we did stand Our presents vp we yeeld, our names, and countrey we declare, Who war on vs haue made, and why to Arpos come we are. When he our message heard, with calmed speach these wordes gan say. O happy people where Saturnus king somtime bare sway, And auncient Auhonians, while liues in rest ye lead, What fortune causd you then the pathes to straungy warres to tread? So many of vs all, as Troyan fields with war did soyle, (Such things I passe, as vnderneath the walles with woful toyle Were done, and what kind men do vnder Simois water lye) The same with wofull punishment throughout the world we bye, And all of vs great penaunce for that foule offence sustaine, Whom Priame, if he liued, now of pitie sure would daine. This doth Mineruas cruell tempest tell, Euboia rockes, And Capharees reuenging hill, and many deadly knockes Against the shore, to diuerse coastes when we dispersed were. And Menelae Atreus sun far hence is banisht, where Done Protoes pyllers stand, right wel the Cyclops all were knowne Unto Vlisses and his mates vnhappy thither blowne. Neptolems realme what shall I name, and cities ouerthrowne? Or else the Ozoly that dwell on shore of Lybie land? Yea Agamemnon king, the leader chiefe of Graetian band, At first his cumming home was by his spouse dispightfull slaine, So when he Troy had raisd, Aegisthus in his seat did raigne. And shall I shew the spite of gods my selfe I did endure? When home I came in hope to finde my lady chast, and sure My citie fayer that Calidona hight, now monstrous sightes Still conuersant before mine eyes my senses much affrightes. For why? my mates which I haue lost, the ayer w? wings haue raught, And turnd to soules the floods do haunt, (O plagues that I am taught Called Diomedes foules, se Plini lib. 10To know of mine) and hollow cliffes with weeping voices fill. And since that time all other things I doubt and feare as ill, When like a bedlem beast, celestiall wightes with steele I smit, And into Venus hand a greeuous wound did hastly hit. Do not I pray you, freends, mee to such battaile euer call, For neuer I since first great Troy downe fell by fatall fall, With Troians would haue ought to doo, ne doth it mee delight When of these mischeeues I do thinke, though they be finisht quite. As for the presents which to me you bring from out your land, Unto Aeneas beare them backe, with whom we hand to hand Or this haue fought, and him against in open armes haue stand. Beleeue me that haue tried, in shield with what force he doth rise? And with what deadly dint his mighty speare in fight he wries? If that besides this man two other such Troy towne had bred, Them selues forth to Inachus towne the Troians sure had sped, And Grætia with contrary fates should waile her heauy plight. For what soeuer lingring time was made in Troian fight He compareth Aeneas w? Hector.Through Hector, and Aeneas hand the conquest still was stayd, Wherby that war to terme of ten yeares complete was delayd. Of valient courage both, and both in armes of worthy might, In godlines yet this exceld, do peace with righthands smight Whilst good occasion offred is, by all meanes do eschue In war with him to wage, least haples hap do make you rue. And thus sir king, the answere of that mighty prince you haue, And of this great, and wofull war the iudgement that he gaue. Scarse had the legates done, when mumbling m?ming much doth rise. Amongst the Latines all, as when great stones in semblaunt wise Some riuer swift do stay, the streame within doth ratling sound, And all the bankes about with crackling noyse againe redound. So soone as were their mindes appeasd, and mouthes at rest did stay The king to gods first praying from hie throne these words gan say. Before this time, O Latines, to determine of this case More meete had bin, and I my selfe therof desierous was. And not as thus at present time, a counsell now to call, When foes be fast at hand, and enmies round besiedge the wall. A bootlesse war, good Citizens, with stock of gods we beare, And with a man whose valient force no wars could euer weare Nor weary once in fight, nor cause him leaue though he were wun. If in Ætolian armes some hope to put you once begun Whom now for ayd you call, henceforth looke that reposed bee The hope of ech one in himselfe though small, as all do see. For other things, how they on ground do lie with woful fall Before your face you see, and in your hands are daily all. Nor do I eny man accuse, echone hath done his best, The bodie whole of all the realme within this war was prest. And now at last what sentence in my doubtfull minde doth lie I meane to shew, in few words (giue eare) I will descrie. There lies an auncient field to Tyber riuer neare about, Forth butting on the west, and vnto Sicilia stretching out, Arunci, and the Rutils till the same, and hillockes smart With ploughes they turne, and mountains sharp to pastures do c?uart. This cuntrey whole, and hilly coast with Pines that doth abound For Troyans freendship let vs giue, and equall leagues compound, And make them fellowes in our land, and place vnto them yeeld, Since that so great desier they haue, and cities let them bueeld. But if to other coastes to cut, straunge nations to assay They do entend, and from our land they may depart away, Twise ten tall ships of Itail Oke to build them by and by Or moe we may for neede, the stuffe by Tybers side doth lye: Let them the numbre poynt, and for their ships the fashion show, And we the keeles, and workmanship, and tacklinges will bestow. Moreouer these our words to tell, and leagues of truce to frame, An hundred legates forth to send to them in Latines name I thinke it best, and Oliue boughes of peace in handes to hold, Precious gifts of y? Romaines. With gifts of price of Iuery fine and talentes great of gold, And kingly cloth of state, and mantel, badge of all our land, To publique welth downe torne almost, set now your helping hand. Drances oration.Then Drances wroth (whom secret hate of Turnus fame did prick, And fame of great exploites atchieud against him causd to kick, In goods right ritch, but more of toongue, in war of dastard minde, But yet in sad, and counsell graue, not far the best behinde, Full fit sedicious seede to rayse, whom mothers noble blood With pride had prickt, but of his sire vncerten still that stood) Upstanding, him in wordes doth blame, and aggrauates with ire. A thing well knowne, and no mans helpe to shew that doth require Most mighty king you do perswade, and all do know full well What thing the people most desier, but that they feare to tell. But let him giue me leaue to speake, and lay apart his pride, By whose vnhap, and dealings far from honest maners wide, (For speake I will, though swords to mee, and cruell death he threat) So many valient lords are slayne, and all this citie great With mourning sits amoapte, whilst Troian tentes he doth assay, Then takes him to his heeles, and welkin winnes with armes to fray. Among these many giftes to Troyans which you send, one thing Do cause moreouer likewise to be borne, O mighty king. Let no mad rage of eny man so much your mind peruart, But that vnto so worthy sun in law, you would impart Your daughter bright in mariage, perpetuall peace to make. But if such feare of Turnus in your trembling breast do ake, Let vs entreat him ernestly and to him let vs sue, That to our king, and cuntrey he would yeeld that is their due. Why doost thou thus our citizens in doubtfull daunger bring So often, thou of Latium plagues that art the only spring? By war no sauftie sure we get, for peace we all do craue At thy hands Turnus, and the maid Lauinia younge to haue. And first my selfe, whom scarce (I know) thou thinkst thy freend to bee, Nor care to bee, for pitie loe entreating come to thee. Take pitie on thy cuntreymen, lay downe thy Peacockes traine, Depart, since thou art vanquished, to many bodies slaine We do already see, our broad wide fieldes forlorne do lie. But if such great renowne, or courage bold in breast on hie Thou doost conceaue, or princesse young thou doost desier soe, Assay him then, and with bold hart encounter with thy foe, That Turnus may by meanes therof enioy a Queene to wife. Wee selly soules, vnburied sort, and vnbewayled, rife About the fields shall lie. And thou, if eny force remaine Or sparck of fathers valient vertue in thy breast, againe Looke him in face that thee doth call. Hereat then Turnus all in rage doth boyle in burning brest, And giues a grone, and from his hart full deepe these words doth wrest. Turnus reply. Great store of talke is redy, Drances, euermore with thee, When blooddy wars do hands require, and first in place to bee Thou wilt be sure, to parlament when Senatours resort. But still the court must not be fild with wordes, and vaine report, Which in abundance great from thee do flow, whilst citie wall Betweene thee, and thine enmy stands, nor ditches blood withall Do flow about. Wherfore as is thy wunted guise persist, And thoundre out thy twatling talke, as long as thou shalt list, And do of feare mee then accuse, when thy couragious hand So many heapes hath sleyne of those that came from Troian land, And all the fieldes about with trophies faire braue decked stand, And there what can thy mighty manhood do thou mayst assay. And as for foes, we neede not to goe seeke them far away, For round the walles they do besiedge. Come on, and let vs goe, And still through dastard cowardice continew not so sloe. What? with thy pratling toongue alone thus alwaies wilt thou fight? And shall thy foolish feete be prest alwaies to shamefull flight? Was I repulst? or is there eny (wretched varlet) well The same can proue, with Troian blood when Tyber streame to swell, And all Euanders stock, and house to ruine brought to bee, And all th'Archadian host, of armes, and force despoyld shal see? Not so did Bitias find in mee, nor yet Pandarus fell. Nor thousands, whom this righthand in one day sent downe to hell When I was cloasd with walles, and hard with heapes of foes beset. By war no sauftie shall we get? these vaine deuises let Be boded to Aeneas head, and to thine owne estate. Nor cease not still to trouble all with foolish fearfull fate, And to extoll that nacions force, that twise was woon in fight, And by that meanes for to debase great king Latinus might. And now the valient peeres of Greece the Phrygian armes do dread. Prince Diomede, and in Larrissa towne Achilles bred. Or els Aufidas riuer swift runnes backe vnto his head. See, this dissembler vile great feare doth fe[illeg.]ne for dread of mee, And aggreuates the crime that it might seeme more big to bee. But neuer thou by mee thy life shalt lose, hold thee at rest, Let that abide with thee, and still remaine within thy brest. Concerning thee, and those the counsels great thou doost disclose Most mighty prince, if in our strength no trust thou do repose, If so wee be forsane, and when our force is once subdued, We quite away ben cast, and fortune cannot be renued, Then let vs treate for peace, and yeelding handes to him submit. But, O, if any iote of woonted valure bide as yit, The same aboue the rest for happy paynes, and courage bolde, He speaketh of MezentiusI will extoll, in him who left the like hee should beholde, Himself did yeelde to death, and with his teeth did teare the grounde. But if some sparkes remaine, and youthes vntwicht may yet be founde, And freendly townes in Italy, and peoples mayne of might: And if our foes with losse of bloud haue woun the price in fight, And equall slaughter they sustayne, and like lucke them attaynt, Why should wee thus like dastards vile, at first beginning faynt? And feare before wee do beginne to fight, thus vs appall? Tyme, &amp; Fortune.Longe tract of Time, and sundrie happes, which in our life befall, Chaunge thinges to better state, and Fortune whom she did disgrace, Oft times agayne doth rayse, and prinkes him vp in prouder place. Though Diomede, Arpenses eke to vs no help will bringe, Messapus will, and happy prince in warre Tolumnius kinge. And Dukes from many nations sent, ne is it simple prayse Which all the mustars tane through Latium lande are like to rayse. And from the noble Volscan blouddes the mayde Camilla hight, A troupe of horsemen that conductes in brazen armour bright. But if the Troyans me alone do seeke for hand to hand, And so you please, and publique weale so much I do withstand, So conquest (as I trust) from these handes will not part away, That any hazard for this hope I dread for to assay. With courage gaynst him will I go, though he Achilles pas, And weare like armour strong, that made by hande of Vulcan was. This life, I Turnus, to you all, and to Latinus vow, To any of mine auncestours in prowes that will not bow. If me alone the Phrygian prince do call, I am content, Or if against mee (wofull wretch) the wrath of god is bent. I would not for my sake, that Drances die, or harme sustaine, Or if the field I win, one iote of praise get by my paine. These words among them selues they do debate of doubtfull things, Aeneas then remooues his campe, and forth his battaill brings. When loe, into the pallaice strait with dred, and tumult great, A skout approching comes the towne with feare that doth repleat, How Troyans now from Tyber shoare come fast in battaill ray, And Tyrrhen bands in rankes there round about the fields they lay. Then strait amazed were mens mindes, and peoples breasts with feare Astoined, with most feruent flames of ire incensed were. They trembling then for armour call, the youth for weapons fret, The wofull fathers weepe, and mumbling moninge voices fet. An hugie noise of sundry tunes into the ayer doth ryse, None otherwise then when a shole of foules aloft that flyes, And on a thicket lightes, or when by Padus riuer shoare The horcey swannes do lift their lay, the bankes the same do roare. Then Turnus taking present time, O citizens, he sayes, Goe call a counsell now, and sitting speake of peaces prayse Whilst foes into our realmes do run: no more therof he sayd But flynging forth full soone him selfe out of the house conuayd. Thou Volusus, commaund (? he) the Volscans, armes to take, He deuideth the charge to his Captaynes. And thou thy self the Rutils lead, Messapus, ready make, And with his brother Coras ioynt the coastes about to skoure, And some go fortefie the gates, some furnish euery tower, The rest with mee, as I haue told, into the field shal yeede. They by and by vnto the walles do fling with flying speede. Th'assembly then, and counsels there begun the king forsakes, And with vnwilling mind them to another time betakes, Himselfe much blaming then, that neuer by his owne accord He called to the towne his sun in lawe the Troian lord. Some trenches cast before the gates, some pyles aloft do rayse Of wood or stone, alarme the trompets call to blooddy frayes. Anon with sundry troupes they compas round about the wall, The matrones with their babes, for daunger calles to labour all. Nolesse vnto the sacred church of Pallas goddesse strait The Queene is born, a beuie braue of dames on her doth wait. Great giftes she bare, and next her side Lauinia bright of hue, The cause of all the strife, and downe to ground her eies she threw. In throng the Ladies thick, the church with incense soote doth reake, And from their loftie thrones, with wofull voyces thus they speake. O thou that only art of warres, Tritonia virgin, chiefe, Confound the weapons with thy hand of this proud Troian thiefe, And strike him dead to ground before our gates y? workes our griefe. Kinge Turnus raging then of striues forth to the field is prest, His braue Rutilian armour now was buckled to his brest With brasen scales right rough, his thies with plates of gold were clad His head as yet vnarmd, his sword to side he fitted had, All glittring bright he shines, and from the pallaice forth he goes Triumphing in his minde, and whole in hope hath foyld his foes. Like as some noble horse that from the stable is start away, And freely flinging forth in open fields, and pastures gay, To others leaze, and heards of Mares doth headlong running dash, Or hies him hastly to some woonted streame himself to wash, His mane then vp he lifts aloft, and wanton runnes his way, The crisping curling lockes vpon his necke do wauing play. Camilla of Volsca.With whom Camilla meeting there with gward of Volscan rout, Against him comes, then there the Queene her self the gates without Downe lights, of whom did all the armed troupe example take, And softly from their horse they leape, and thus to him she spake. If noble harts may eny hope repose in valient hands, O Turnus, both I dare and vow to meete the Troian bands, And with the Tyrrhen horsmen eke encounter on the way. Let mee the onset giue of formost fight this present day, Still stay you heare on foote, and manfully the walles defend. Then Turnus speaking on the virgin fierce his eyes doth bend. O virgin flower of Latium land, what thankes to yeeld to thee, Or kindnes to requite shall I deuise may worthy bee? But since thy valient hart doth all aduentures great exceede, I pleased am (O Queene) to part this paine with thee indeede. Aeneas, as the fame and skoutes do tell, for this entent, Before him well arayd his troupes of horsmenlight hath sent, To sack the fertile fields, him selfe through craggy hilles on hie, And deserts deepe, in hast vnto the towne approcheth nie. In secret Ambush I, in yonder wood, in place not wide, That so both waies I may besiedge, my selfe entend to hide. Do thou vpon the Tyrrhen horsmen set with ioyned band, With thee shall sharpe Messapus yeede, and troupes of Latine land, And strong Tiburtus power, and take to thee the charge of all. He said, and with like words Messapus forth to fight doth call, Him with his captaynes all alike hee kindleth gainst their foes, And forth him selfe anon before them all with courage goes. There lies a vally low with crooked turnes a craftie place, And fit for sleights of war, whom thickets blacke on ech side trace. The sides do narow shut, a litle path therto doth lye, And passadge passing streight, or ragged cragged entrance hie. This plaine lyes quite vnknowne with corners saulfe to lurck within, Where on the lifthand, or the right the battayle do begin, Or on the Hill you list to stand, and storme of stones down cast. By rediest way in coast well known, doth Turnus thither hast, And quickly takes the place, and thicke in woods him selfe he hides. Therwhiles Diana faier in lofty skies aboue that bides, Dame Opus swift to her doth call, a chast and fellow mayd, And one of her vntouched troupe, and thus to her she sayd With heauy cheere. O virgin pure, Camilla forth doth pas Unto a bloody war, armd with our tooles in vaine, alas. Her do I loue aboue the rest, ne to Diana new This lyking lately sprang, nor ioy in minde on sodein grew. Pulst out through spite from natiue realme by subiectes hauty might, When Metabus from old Priuerna towne did take his flight, The stori of Camilla &amp; Metabus her father This infant vp he snatcht, when rage of war was thickst of all, A mate in exile sharpe, and her by mothers name did call, And of Casmilla her by shorter name Camilla hight. Her in his armes he bare when through the desert tops his flight Of wast forlorned hilles he tooke, and dartes about him flew, And him on euery side, thicke troupes of Volscans did pursue. When loe, in midst of flight Amasenus with water store Aboue his bankes brakeout, such plentie rayne not long before There fell, wherouer whilst anon to swim he doth assay, He feares (alas) his burden deeere, pure loue doth cause him stay. Then musing much in minde, at last this practise best he thaught. A mighty speare which into hand that time by chance he caught, When as he fought, of knotty wood shaptforth, and Oke fulstout, To this his doughter deere in barke of tree encloasd about He bindes, and fitly to the mids of mighty speare he ties, And oft it shaking in his valient hand, thus loud he cries. Diana bright and virgin pure that in these woods doost hide, I vow a seruant here to thee, that bound vnto her side Most humbly holding fast a speare, flies from her foes receaue Her (goddesse) to thy charge, whom here in doubtfull case I leaue. He said, and strait with bended arme the weapon forth he throwes, The waters sound, aloft the riuer swift, Camilla flowes. Then Metabus when now the prease began approch him nie, The riuer strait he takes, his speare, and babe, therwith doth wrie Out of a greengrasse turfe, a gift that great Diana sent. No people house for harbour him, nor walled cities lent, Nor if they eny offred had, he neuer would consent. A sheepheards life among the sole, and saluage hils he led, His tendre child in thickest thornes, and beds of beastes he fed With milke of mares vnmild, and sucke of beastes were neuer caught, And to her tendre lyps in milking, downe their dugs he raught. Camillas actiuitie in her infancie.But when her pretie foote she first began to set to ground, Her hands, and euery part with sharpned darts he laded round. A quiuer on her shoulders small he hung with crooked bow. In steade of golden caulle, and mantell braue should hang below, A Tygers skin downe from her head along her backe doth fall, With litle childish dartes her handes he armes to play with all, Or by a twisted thong about her head she whirles a sling, Wherwith sumtime a Crade, sumtime a Swan she downe doth bring. Her many noble dames through Tyrrhen townes wheras she went Haue wisht in vayne, their doughterlaw she were, but she content Alone with chast Dianas grace, her selfe preserueth still Untwight vnto her tooles, and virgins lyfe leades most at will. Would god she had with no such fond desier of war bin cought, When first the valyent Troyans to prouoke in fight she sought, Her do I tendre much, and would she yet remaind with mee, But now with destnies her, and fatall fall opprest I see. Descend, deere Nimphe, from heauen, and Latine fields go visite streite, Wheras with haples hap, and blooddy broile this fray they feight. Take these, and from this quiuer, shaftes of sharpe reuenge addresse, And whosoere her sacred corps with wound shal once oppresse, Where he of Troy or Latium be, his blood shall that repay. Then in an hollow cloud anon her wofull corps away, And armour vndefilde, I to her natiue soyle will beare, And in a worthy sepulcher my selfe interre her there. She said, then through y? flickring aier w? wings she down ward slides, And giues a rush, and with a tempest blacke her body hides. Ther whiles the Troian bands vnto the walles approched nie. Hetruscan captaines with their troupes of horsmen, by and bie Them selues bestow in good aray, the palfries stamping fret Throughout the field, and raind with sturdy bits forth softly iet Now here now there, the field rough stands with many a pyke &amp; launce And from their lofty helmets far the glittring Sunbeames glaunce. On totherside Messapus sharpe, and Latines fierce to fight, And Coras with his brother, and Camillas winge so bright Standforth against them in the field, and launces fast do make Within their restes, &amp; pointes of trembling speares fast charged shake, Their foes abode, and noise of steedes them sore on fier do set. But when both armies were at cast of dart togither met, There still awhile they stayd, a shriching shout they sodeyn raise, Their chaumping horse they harten forth, the dartes flie euery waies They giue the onset Like snow that thick doth fall, black shade the heauen quite ouerlaies. And first with spitefull speares, Tyrrhenus with Acontie tall Encountring fiercely meete, and first with mighty noyse do fall To ground, the steedes echothers breast with breast doth squeezing iolt. Acontie there vnhorst as swift as thickest thunderbolt, Or like some stone by engine great of war forthflung downe lightes, And into thin and flickring aier exhales his vitall sprites. Incontinent the rankes are broke, and Latines put to flight Cast backe their shieldes, and headlong horses pricke to citie right. The Troians then, and first Asilas sharpe the chase pursue, And now to gates they neere were come, the Latines then anew A mighty noyse extoll, and horses neckes about do wrie. The Troians turne their backes, and largely yeelding raynes, do flie. Like as the sea with altring course that forth doth running freat, A doubtfull batel. Somtimes it flowes to shore, &amp; rockes with rouling waues doth weat, And foming on the sand and beach, along doth tumbling glide: Somtime doth swiftly ebbe, when force doth fayle, and backe doth slide From rockes and shore with vailing streame, and failing flood it falles. The Tyrrhens twise the Rutils chase in fight vnto the walles, And twise repulst looke backe, and backes with bucklars broad defend, But when they to the fight a fresh and third assault descend, The rankes together run, and man to man doth stifly sticke. Then shoutes are heard of such as fall, and in the blood waxt thicke Both men and armour deepely waultring fall, and steedes halfe dead. The battell growes, when Orsiloch sir Remulus did dread Himselfe to set vpon, into his horse a speare he thrust, And vnderneath the coursers eare the head leaues sticking iust. Then strait the steede enraged stands on end, and vp doth throw His legs with breast erect, nor in no wise could bide the blow. He falles vnhorst to ground, Catillus driues to earth downe right Iolas stout of minde, of stature eke a goodly knight. And great in armes Herminie hard, whose head with golden heare Lies bare with shoulders bare, nor of his wounds doth stand in feare, So great in armes he lies, y? speare prickt through his shoulders quakes And twise through girt his backe, his deadly payne twise double makes. Goare blood on euery side is shed, by fight are numbres slaine, And by their wounds ech seekes a glorious death for to obtaine. And now this manly Amazon in slaughter much doth ioy Slaughters committed by Camilla.In midst of fight, whose pap, least vse of war should her anoy Cut of vnto Camilla quiuerd was in tendre yeares. Her slender shaftes about she shootes from quiuer which she beares. Sometime her sharpned are vntierd she takes into her hand, Sometime her golden bow, the tooles of chast Dianas band. And if perchaunce repulst, she do retyre pursued in chase, Her bowe she turnes behinde, and strikes her followers in the face. About her chosen mates do ride, Larina, and Tulla bright Pure virgins, with Tarpeia weilding glittring axe in fight Italian trulles, and chast Camilla of speciall purpose those For honours sake, for time of peace, for trustie seruice chose. Like as Amazones of Thracie land when waters thay Of Thermodoon beat, with armour painted passing gay, About Hyppolita their Queene, or when the virgin stout Penthesilea home in charret comes, the femell rout With shritches shrill reioysing cries, and shields like moones cut out. Whom dost thou first, wh? last, O virgin fierce, by force down throw? Or O, how many corpses slaine on ground doost lay full low? Eumenie first of Clytie father borne, whose naked brest Against her there that stood with launce of firtree through doth threst, He floods of blood out spuing, falles, and earth with teeth doth teare, And where he fell vpon his wound, lies tumbling dying there. Next on him Lyris she, and Pegase throwes, but Lyris while His bridell raignes he raught, from horse to ground he doth requile. But Pegase cumming him to ayde, with feeble hand forth held, Both ioyntly headlong wise with dubled fall to ground she feld. To these Amastrus neare she laies, vnto Hippota sun, And couching downe vnto her speare from far doth fetch her run At Terreus, and Harpalisie, and Demophoon stout, And Cronie strong, and many a captaine more of Troian rout. And looke how many shiuering shafts forth from her side she drew, So many carcases to ground of Troian knights she threw. There Ornitus a far in armour straunge, and hunterwise, Upon a proud Apulian steede about the batteyll flies, Whose necke, and shoulders broad an hyde late hald from Oxes backe Did couer, on his head the large wyde gaping iawes there stacke Pluckt from a wolfe, with grinning, glittring greedy teeth full white. A clounish club in hand he bare, he throngs in thickst of fight, In stature all the rest by heyght of head he doth exceede. Him she (nor was it when their foes retierd a glorious deede) Strikes through, &amp; thus she speakes with hateful hart as there she stood. Thoughtst thou some beast in chase thou, Tyrrhen, hadst within a wood? The day is come when as a womans armour shal refute Thy boasting brags, yet no small same to this thou maist impute, That by these hands thou dying with Camillas launce art slayne. Orsilochus, and Butes next, two bodyes mighty mayne Of Troian rout, but Butes her against with dart she strake, Which forth a way betwixt his helmet braue and gorget brake About his necke that glittring shynes, his shield hung downe his side. And feyning from Orsilochus as though she fled, doth ryde The Carrire round, and craftely she keepes the middle place, And whilst he her pursues, therwhiles she followeth him in chase, And through his armour strong, the flesh, and bones, an axe she beats Highrising at her blowe, and whilst he twatling much entreates, She dableth stil the wound, &amp; with warm braines his face he weats. Here with comes in, and at first sight astoined much he stands Syr Aunus sun of Appenine, a martiall man of hands, Ligures wer great diss?blers and liers.And not among the Ligures woorst, whilst fates did him permit By subtile colourd shiftes vnto ech purpose fine to fit. When he perceaud from fight he could no wise escape away: By treacherous traine he thought, and gloasing guile her to assay, And thus began. A woman thou if to a trustie steede Thy selfe thou do commit, is it a great or valient deede? Forsake thy horse, and match on ground thy selfe to mee betake, And vnto equall fight on foote thee quickly ready make, Then shalt thou know to whom this glory fond due praise shall bring. He said, but she enraagd whom griefe with sharpe desier did sting, Unto her mate her steede she tooke, in armes on ground she stands With blade on foote forth drawne, and bucklar pure fast hent in hands. The yonker then supposing thus by craft he her had quit, Away strait swiftly pricking flies, not lingring euer a whit His nimble steede with raignes he quickly turnes, and thence him hies, His pearstly prauncing beast with spurres of steele apace he plies. O Ligur vaine, and to no purpose brag, and proud of hart, In vaine sir subtile thou assayest to trie thy cuntreyes art, No slypprie shift shall thee aliue to crafty Aunus saue. These words the virgin spake, and fierce on foote a spring she gaue, And swiftly soone outran the horse, and fast the raignes she raught The Ligur is slayne.And at him strake, and glad on enmies blood reuenge she wraught. Much like a fawcon faire from loftie towre his flight that takes, And at a twigging doue aloft to cloudes swift towering makes, When her at souse hath tane with talantes sharpe her guts pulles out, The goarie blood, and fethers plumed flit the ayer about. These things the father of gods and men in heauen that sits on hie Doth heedfully behold, and warly weighes with watching eie. Then Tyrrhen Tarchon stout to entre fight he did prouoke, And with no gentle rage of frantike anger forth him stroke. Wherfore in thickst of slaughters great, and rankes enforst to flie, On horsebacke Tarchon throngs, and sundry voyces liftes on hie. The wings he hartneth on, and by his name ech man doth call, And such as were repulst, he makes a fresh to fighting fall. What feare is this? that neuer will repent your foolish flight O Tyrrhens dastards stil? what daunt within your harts doth light? A woman stragling you pursues, and doth discomfit quight. Unto what end these swordes and weapons do you beare in hand? Not so at Venus games, nor warres by night you lingring stand, Nor when God Bacchus crooked pipe to dauncing you doth call, And vnto costly cates, and tables lade with wine to fall. That is your ioy, that your delight, when as the prophet good With sacrifice, and fatted ost, doth call you to the wood. This said, into the thickest foes himself foorth thronging flinges, And mad, he meetes with Venulus, whom chaunce against him bringes. There raught from of the horse with his righthand he held his foe, And forceblye him wringing to his breast, away doth goe. A noyse vnto the heauen they rayse, the Latines turne their eyes Upon this fact, and Tarchon swift about the field he flies Both bearing man and armour still away, and from his speare The head he wrested off, and euery place he searcheth wheare A deadly wound he may bestow, he wrestling doth rebell To saue the sword from out his throate, and force by force repell. And as the Eagle fierce which in the ayre aloft doth flie, When vp some snake hath snatcht that late a sleape on ground did lie, And gript him fast within his foote, enclaspt with talents round, The snake about him wrigling winding wreades with griefe of wo?d, And scales doth roughly rayse, and angred with her mouth doth hisse. With crooked beake he wrestling nippes her nerethelesse for this, And flying foorth his wayes aloft with wings the ayre doth beat. None otherwise his pray from Tyburt oste sir Tarchon great Triumphing beares away, their captaynes dede, and happy chaunce The Lydians do following pursue: then swift with launce Camilla comes, whom Aruns due to death by sleight full slie Aruns murderer of Camilla. Doth ride about, the fittest side for his behoofe to trie. And looke through thickest rankes whereas the virgin fiercely flew, Sir Aruns thither hies, and secretly her steppes doth view. What way she conqueresse returnes, and foote from foes doth bend, That way the youth by stealth his nimble reignes about doth wend. And now this way, now that agayne, and round about the place With fatall, certayne, speare in hand doth following after trace. By chaunce vnto Cybele sacred priest, sir Chlorie hight, From far aboue the rest in Phrygian armes did shyne full bright. A foming courser forth he prickt, whose breast, and buttockes wide A skinne beset with brasen studdes, and glittering gold did hide. Himself in purple sad, and scarlet pure full fine beseene, In Lycian bow his shaftes he shot in Creta made that beene. His golden bow from shoulder twanges, a guilden helme he beares. A yealow silken weede, with boughting bosomes wide he weares, Whose lappets ratling large in knot of costly gold were tyde, His coate with needle broidred was, his sturdie thies did hyde A skirt of purple silke and gold in forrein countrey wrought. The virgin him, for cause his armour braue wherin he fought, And Troyan spoyles on temples hang she would for honours sake, Or else herselfe in huntreswise, with gold full braue would make With blinde desire pursues, and all incenst through thickest rout, With greedy womans lust of spoyles, she flies the field about. When Aruns long in wait that lay, had fit occasion spied, A whirling dart he threw, and thus vnto the Gods he cried. Most mighty god Apollo guyde of drad Soractis hill, Whom we aboue the rest adore, to whom soote smellinge still Of Pinetrees hugie flames we feede, and through whose only might Thy seruaunts dare to walke on fiery coales hot burning bright. O father graunt that by our tooles this shame be tane away, Almighty since thou art: not for the virgins spoyles I pray, Nor monument I seeke, nor pillage proude from her to take, Some other deede hereafter this shall me right famous make. But let this cruell plague fall downe with dint of this right hand, And I deuoyde of fame will hence returne to natiue land. Apollo heard his wish, and part to graunt he was content, And part to be disperst in flickring aire abroade he sent, That Queene Camilla fierce with deadly wound down slayn should bee He graunted, but with safe returne his natiue soyle to see He did not graunt, that voyce he bid the winds abroade confound. Then when the whirling dart forth throwne in aire had raisd a sound, Both armies gan attend, and eyes vnto the Volscan Queene They all do cast, she minds no whit the things th? wrought that beene, Nor ayer, nor yet the sound, nor dart aboue full swift of flight, Camilla is slayne.Till vnderneath her sacred pap the fatall launce doth light, And deepely entring in at full in virgins blood doth bayne. Her fearefull female guard togeather runs, and doth sustayne Their fainting ladies corpes, fast Aruns flies before them all, Whom as did ioy refresh, so feare admixt did much appall. And now he dares no more vnto her dreadfull launce to trust, Nor yet into the sight of her agayne himself to thrust. And like a Woolfe before the hatefull hunters him doe chase, Unto the wast forlorned hils forth hies himselfe apace, When he some heardsman stout, or heckfer great of grease, and lim Deuoured hath, and guiltie of that fact, and deede full grim His trembling tayle betweene his legges lets fal, and woods doth seeke: Sir Aruns so him out of sight withdrawes in maner leeke, And with his flight content amidst the thickst himselfe doth hyde. She dying drawes the dart which in the wound did deepe abyde, The mortall toole in wound full wide stickes fast within her syde. Shee faintes for want of blood, her eyes to death yeeld vp their due. Strait from her face departs the stayned cheekes, and purple hue, And dying thus to Acca trustie virgin fellow sayes, A virgin to Camilla true before the rest alwayes, With whom she woonted was her cares and sorrowes all impart, And thus to her began to speake with fayling fainting hart. Untill this time, O sister Acca deare, of force I was, A cruell mortall wound my life abridges now, alas, And althings round, me seemes, looke rustie dustie darke as hell. Flie hence, and doe with speede, my message last to Turnus tell, That he to battayle come, and keepe the Troyans from the towne. And now farewel, and with that worde the raignes she yeelded downe, Herselfe to earth not willing sinkes, and waxing cold, vntwynes The conflict of death with life. By smale and smale herselfe out of her corps, and then resignes Her lithie head and neck to death, and armour doth forsake, Her ghost flies fast with griefe and great disdayne to Lymbo lake. Forthwith a mightie noyse the golden starres in heauen doth touch, And since Camillas death the battell fierce encreaseth much. They thick come running on, both all the bandes of Troyans stoute, And Tyrrhen captaynes, with Euanders winges th'Archadian rout. And now Dianas dearling bright, Nimph Opis sits on hie Upon the toppe of loftiest hilles, the battayle to descrie. And when from farre she saw in raging noyse of youthfull trayne, With dolefull death, and wound vnworthy far Camilla slayne, She fet a sigh, and deepe from out her brest these words she sayd. Too deare O virgin, thou too deare a cruell price hast payde, That thou the valient Troyans dursts prouoke in open sight. That thou Dianas grace in woods didst serue forsaken quight It nothing thee auailes, or that our quiuer thou didst weare, Or glittering golden bow vpon thy tender shoulders beare. Howbeit thy noble Queene meanes not to leaue thee voyde of fame, Nor that thy drierie death shall lurking sleape for lack of name, Amongst all nations farre and wide, or vnreuenged bee. Thy corps with mortall wound that did defile, what euer hee, With death deseru'd shalbe requit. Beneath on hill full hie The tumbe of old Dercennus king raisd vp aloft doth lie With mightie mount of auntient Laurent ground, an Ilex tree With glummish darkish shade bespreads the same, that none may see. Here first this goddesse fayre, with passing speedy course doth light, And from this hillock farre at Aruns aimes within her sight. Whom when she glittring saw in armes, and vainly puft with pride, Why fliest thou hence (? she) approch, thy steppes do hither guide, Come neere that now must die, and due desart receaue agayne For Queene Camillas death, and with Dianas shafts yslayne, So vile a wight so worthy a death for fact so foule must bide? She said, and strait in Thracian huntreswise, from by her side A golden flight forth of her quiuer pluckes, her bow she bendes, And drawes him deepe vntill the nockes meete iust at both the endes, And both her handes do leuell stand, and arrowhead doth twight The bowhand, and the string round to her eare she drawes vp quight, Immediately the singing shaft, and whirling aire doth crack. Sir Aruns heard, and fast at once the shaft within him stack. Him yeelding vp the ghost, and fetching deepe his finall grone His mates forgetfull in the field abroade do leaue alone, And Opis strait with winges to lofty heauen doth take her flight. At Camillas death her souldiours were put to flighte.First at their ladies death doe flie Camillas horsemen light, And Rutils run amoapt, and fierce Atinas flies apace, And captaynes all are quayld, and standardbearers forst in chase For rescue runne, and to the towne doe fast on horseback hie. None dare the Troians stout, that following after fast do flie With setled foote withstand, nor yet in warlike armes resist, But bowes vnbent on shiuering shoulders beares with fainting fist, And coursers with their hooues the rotten dustie fieldes do shake, Unto the walles an whirlewind black with tumbling dust doth rake, And matrones tooting out the loops their breasts there beat straitwaies And forth a womans shritch vp to the starres in heauen they rayse. There those that first into the open gates most swiftly prest, The mingled enmies power in thickest routes did most molest, Ne wofull death they doe escape, but at first entraunce in, And euen within their citie walles, and when as housd they bin, Throughgirt with speares they die, some shut the gates, and do debar Free entrance to their mates, nor dare for life the doores vnspar Though wofully without the gates they wayle, a direfull death Amongst defendants falles, and such in armes as yeeld their breath, Slaughter of the Latines. And such as were shut out before their parents weeping eyes, When cruell force constraynes, some headlong into ditches flyes, Some blinded with the dust, and giuing spurre, and yeelding raigne, Against the gates, and rampiers hard of poastes doe run amaine. The matrones from the walles when they beheld Camilla dead, Their trembling dartes cast forth (for so their countrey loue them lead) And staues of oke ysteelde, and poales of length forebrent at end, And dare the dread of death assay, whilst they their walles defend. Therwhiles within the woodes, an heauy message Turnus frayes, And to the valient youth amazing great doth Acca rayse. How that the Volscans vanquisht are, Camilla slaine in fight, And enmies fast approching come, and all in battaile quight Haue ouerthrowne, that feare vnto the citie walles doth goe. He then enraagde (for why the power of Ioue would haue it soe) The hilles possest of late, and thickets sharpe doth strait forsake, Who scarce was now come forth, and large abroade the fields did take, When Lord Aeneas to the forest wide himselfe doth speede, And hilles doth ouertrace, and from thick woods doth forth proceede. So both vnto the walles in hast with all their power doe flie, And both the marching troupes not many paces distant lie. But when the smoaking fieldes with dust Aeneas did behold, And marching bandes in battayle ray of towne Laurentum old, And Turnus did from farre Aeneas yrefull countnance view, And trampling of their feete, and neighing of their horses knew: Immediately they had their armies ioynd, and battayle tried, Nighte keepeth them fr? battayle. Had not sir Phœbus bright with purple mantle brauely died His horses dipt in seas, and bringing night expulst the day. They pitch their tentes before the towne, and trenches deepe do lay. DEO GRATIAS. Finitum Londini, Per Thomam Twynum 14. Iunij. 1573. Opus 20. Dierum plus minus, per interualla. THE TWELFTH BOOKE of the Æneidos of Uirgill. The Argument. When the Latines were vanquished, Turnus seeing all his helpe to bee reposed in himselfe, contrarye to the perswasion of Latinus, and the Queenes manifolde teares: determineth to fight hande to hand with Aeneas, and sendeth such word vnto him by Idmon his messenger. Aeneas is therewith pleased, and with solemne othes on both sides they make the league, whiche Iuturna through perswasion of Iuno in the shape of Camertes, disturbeth. First of all, Tolumnius the Southsayer, that by a false shew proficied victorye to his side: striketh through with a Darte one of Gilippus sunnes. Aeneas likewise, seeking meanes to appease the tumulte: is wounded by an arrow vncertayne by whom it was shot, and is constrayned to leaue the battaile. Which Turnus vnderstanding, supposing he had gotten a great occasion of good successe: maketh great slaughter on his foes. Venus cureth her sunne with Dyttany of Ida. Aeneas, amended: commeth agayne foorth, and rescueth his mates, and namely calleth for Turnus in fight. But Turnus still withdrawing himselfe, (for Iuturna his sister in shape of Metiscus the wagoner, carrying him alwayes aside would not suffer him meete with Aeneas in batayle) hee determineth to besiege the towne, and leading his army neare to the walles casteth fire vp to the Turrets, &amp; houses. Then Amata supposing that Turnus was slayne: through extreame sorrow hangeth her self. These thinges being told vnto Turnus by Sages seeing that he must needes fight, or suffer his confederate towne come into his enemies hands before his face: voluntarily prouoketh Aeneas to the combate according to the tenure of the league. In which fight Aeneas hauing the victorye, and being almost mooued to take compassion, and graunt lyfe to his enemie: yet when he saw the gyrdle vpon his shoulder which he had taken from Pallas, whom he had slaine before, sodaynly mooued with anger: thrusteth him to the hart. With daunted force, &amp; fight vnlucky late, wh? quaild to bee His Latines stout of yore, most valient Turnus Prince did see, Himself a marke to eche mans eyes, outragious gan to boyle And rise in rage, much like a Lyon fierce of Affrick soyle, Whose breast, wh? first with dint of hunters speare is wounded deepe, He then prepares himselfe to fight, and curled lockes doth keepe With wrath erected on his neck, the hunters launce with pawes Fast sticking bold he breakes, and foming frets with bloody iawes. None otherwise the rage of furious Turnus forth doth breake, And to Latinus King thus gan with troubled mind to speake. In Turnus is no stay, why dastard Troyans should forsake Their word there is no cause, nor breake the bargayne they did make. Him will I matche, bring sacrifice, our league come vnderstand. The Dardan Lord will I send hence to hell with this right hand, That runaway from Asia land, let Latines keepe them still, And countries common shame with sword alone cut off I will, Or quite he vs shall ouerthrow, and wife Lauinia haue. To whom with sober moode Latinus than this answere gaue. O most couragious youth, how much the more thou doost exceede In valyant hart, so much the more is meete I should indeede Giue graue aduise, and charely for chaunces all prouide. Thou hast thy father Daunus realmes, and many a towne beside Wunne with thyne hand, Latinus welth, and courage hath likewise, In Latium land and in Laurentum soyle right large that lies, Are many moe vnmaried dames, and not of basest line. Now giue me leaue the truth in open wordes for to vntwine, And print it deepe in minde what I hereof to thee shall show. On eny of her auntient loues my daughter to bestow This was Faunus forewarning. I was forbid, so all the goddes and men to me haue told. Bold yet for loue of thee, and for our kindreds sake as bold, And for our heauy spouses teares, all promise made I brake, And from my sunne his wife, my selfe to wicked armes haue take. Since which time, Turnus, thou hast seene, what chaunces did ensue, What warres, what payns to thee as cheefe amongst the rest there grue. Twise ouerthrowne in battayls great, scarce in the towne we keepe The hope of all Italia land, and Tybers channell deepe Yet with our blood doth warmed run, and fields with bones looke white. O where turne I so oft? what madnesse mooues my minde so light? If Turnus die, and straight for them as for my peeres I send, Why rather doe I not whilst he doth liue, this quarrell end? What will my cousins Rutils say, what all Italia land If thee to death I should betray (which chaunce the Gods withstand) Which doost our daughter craue, to ioyne with vs in wedlocke band? Regarde the doubtfull happes of warre, and do some pitie take Upon thine auntient sire, whom wofull warres do carefull make, And Ardea countrey deare, full far from hence doth now disioyne. But Turnus all these wordes cannot perswade for to resigne, His rage which waxeth more, and still in healing doth augment. But wh? he once could speake, these words from out his mouth he sent. O father deare, this care which you in my behalfe do take, Cast off at my request, nor be so carefull for my sake, And suffer me in steede of prayse a famous death obtayne. For we our darts do throw, and swords do draw not still in vayne, And strength in hands we haue, &amp; from our woundes blood runneth red. Far shall his mother be, that flying him with clowd shall spred, And vayne in flickering shade withdraw her selfe soone out of sight. But now the Queene at nouell guise of battle much affright With weeping like to die, her sonne in law in armes she hent. O Turnus, by these teares of mine, or euer if thou were bent Amatas honour to preserue (for hope of elder yeares Thou art, and of our rest alone, and honour which vpbeares The state of Latine realme, our shakned house on thee doth lie) Graunt me this thing, with Troians stoute thou do not battell trie. For whatsoeuer chaunce in this conflict thou doest sustaine O Turnus I sustayne the same, and lothsome life refraine Therewith determined I am, for sunne in law to see Aeneas shall I not abide, and captiue Queene to bee. The bewtie of Lauinia. Lauinia then with teares her mothers talke did vnderstand, With burning blushing cheekes, whom colour much had out of hand With heat inflamed, vp which to her face foorthwith did spred, Like as when Iuery white by chaunce is staind with scarlet red, Or purple roses pure with Lilies white lie mixt in place, Such was the virgins hue, such were the colours in her face. Him loue disturbeth much, and on the mayde his eyes he stayes, And burnes to battell more, and to Amata shortly sayes. O mother, do not now with wofull teares me thus pursue, Ne giue me cause hereby to dread that lucke shall light ascue. In Turnus power, if destnies will, it lyeth not death to fly. Go Idmon, tell the Phrygian king this message by and by Which will not please him wel, when first to morow in welkin bright, In purple charret drawne the morning cleare shall rise in sight, His Troyans foorth he do not lead agaynst the Rutil bandes, The Troians still do hold, and Rutils eke their blades in hands. But in that fight with our two blood shall ended be the strife, And in that field be tride, who shall Lauinia wed to wife. When he these words had said, and hied him thence to court apace, He calles for steedes, and ioyes to see them fome before his face, Which to Pilumnus once for present gaue Orithyia faier, In whitenesse passing driuen snow, in swiftnes nimble aier. Orithyia, daughter to Erihtheus, wife to Boreas. The keepers quicke there stand about, and them with handes prouoke, With sounding blowes on breast, &amp; curled manes w? combes do stroke. Anon his gorget gay with gold and siluer damaskt bright, And scarlet worke ywrought, about his necke he fitteth tight. His sword and target next, and ruddie plumes of feathers braue, The sword which vnto Daunus old sumtime god Vulcan gaue, And fiery flaming hot in lake of Stix did deepely quent. Then strait a mighty speare, which to an hugie pillar hent Erect amid the house, with valient force in hand he tooke, Sir Actor of Aruncans spoyle, and fiercely foorth it shook Thus crying out, O speare, whom neuer yet I cauld in vaine, The time is come when thou with mee this brunt must needes sustaine. Thee mighty Actors hand somtime, but now doth Turnus hold. His carcas graunt that I may ouerthrow in battaile bold, And with a valient hand from of the necke the gorget teare Of that same Cocknie Phrygian knight, and drench in dust his heare, And lockes with bodkins frisled fine, and moyst with Mirrhe, &amp; oyles. These furies forth him pricke, and from his face with rage that boyles The sparckles sprincling flie, and eyes with flaming fier do glow. Like as a mighty Bull sendes forth his voyce, and loud doth low When first he comes to fight, and proues his hornes in rage to whet, And spying far a tree, himself therto doth cloasly set, And rough with stroakes prouoking windes the grauell flings about. No lesse therwhiles in mothers armour strong Aeneas stout, Himself to war prepares, and sharpe prouokes himself with ire, And ioyes the war with league so ended is, his great desier. Then to his mates, and faire Iule he comfort great doth bring, Instructing them in destnies all, and legates to the king He bids with certaine answere to returne, and to declare The whole conditions of the league, what they in ordre are. The dawning next the hilles with light had scarcely ouer spred, When first sir Phœbus steedes forth of the sea did lift their hed, And from their loftie nostrels wide did blow the broad daylight When strait before the citie walles they measure for the fight An equall plaine, both Rutilmen, and Troyans mixt a vie, And fiers in the midst they make, and altars build on hie, Of earthen turnes yframd, vnto the equall gods to stand. And fast some water fetch, some crackling fier bring in their hand, In surplice white of linen clad, and temples compast round With wreath of Ueruine soote, and holly herbes togither bound. The Latine armie issueth forth, and bandes with darts that fight In clusters thicke to gates do throng, and Troyans armie bright With Tyrrhens armd in sundry sort, with speed they forth do flie, Nonotherwise in armour prest, then if that by and by They should to battayle fierce descend, and thick in thousands told The captaines scoure about, in scarlet braue, and glittringe gold: The ofspring of Assaracus, Mnesthee, Asylas wilde, Messapus eke a tamer stout of steedes, Neptunus childe. And when at certain signe into their place they drew them all, Their pykes they pitch on ground, &amp; downe their shields they let to fall. The matrones then with great desire to see, and rascall rout, And men vnweldy old, the turrets hie, and tops about Of houses do bestride, and loftie ridge of gates do clim, And vp the walles they slide, and couch them thick vpon the brim. But Iuno from a loftie hill, that now Albanus hight, (For then it was deuoyd of name, renowme, and glorie quight,) Downe looking all the campe at length, and breadth she did behold, And both the armies viewd, both Latines stout, and Troyans bold, And Laurent towne, and strayt to Turnus sister gan to speake, One Goddesse to her feere, that standing lakes, and floods that creake Doth ouerrule. This honour great, the king of heauen aboue For maydenhode bereft bestowed on her in dulcet loue. Iunos talk to IuturnaO Nimphe, the glory great of streames, beloued most of mee, Thou knowest of all Latine ladies bright, how only thee, That to almighty Ioue ingreatefull bed ascended haue I do esteeme, and willingly a place in heauen I gaue. Now lerne thy griefe, and do not mee henceforth, Iuturna, blame. So far as fortune would permit, and destnies graunt the same, Both Latium state, and Turnus, and thy walles I did defend. But now the youth with partiall fates I see to battaile wend, Now fatall destnies day, and cruell force, at hand they bee, Ne may I with mine eyes abide this fight, or league to see. Thou, if thou canst deuise some meanes, thy brother to aduaunce, Assay, perhaps in time poore wretches may haue better chaunce. Scarce had she said, but strait in teares forth faire Iuturna brake, And thrise or fouertimes her cumly brest with fist she strake. This is no time for teares (? Iuno then) but make some speede, And Turnus saue from death, if meanes may be deuisde, indeede. And do them strait to war prouoke, and breake the league they make, Let mee be authour of the deede, this said, she did forsake Her doubtfull much, and troubled sore with wofull wound of mind. Therwhiles the kings (Latinus with an hugie traine assignd, In charret drawne w? fouer horse rides, whose auncient temples round With glittting beames of gold in numbre twelue about were bound, The Sun his grandsiers badge, in charret drawn w? two horse whight Forth Turnus comes, with launces twaine broad armd with iron bright On th'other side Aeneas, founder first of Romane blood, With burning bucklar bright, and heauenly armour strong and good, And next Iülus younge, of mighty Rome the second hope) Forth of their tentes proceede, a priest beseene in purest cope, A youngling yelt of brestled sow, and twinling sheepe vntwight Brings forth, and hales the beastes vnto the altars burning bright. They turning then their faces forth vnto the risinge sun, Do sprinckle bran and salt about, the scissers round do run About the temples of the beastes, and wine on altars lay. Then lord Aeneas with his fauchon bright forthdrawne, doth pray. Beare witnes of my words, O Sun, and thou Italia land, For whose alonly sake these trauailes great I tooke in hand, And thou almighty Ioue, and thou nolesse, O Iuno bright, More gentle goddesse now I trust, and Mars of warlike might, Who as it seemes most best to thee, all bloodie warres doost guide, You Springs and Riuers eke I call, and what soere doth bide Relligious to heauens high, or blueish sea belowe: If so on Turnus happy lucke the conquest do bestowe, Tis meete that to Euanders towne we conquered goe againe, The conditions of y? truce. Iülus shall depart the realme, and from all war refraine The vanquisht Troyans shall henceforth, nor armes herafter take, Nor yet molest this land with war, that they shall hap to make. But if through force of armes to vs the conquest lotted bee, As so I hope it shall, and gods vs graunt the same to see, I neuer shall Italians force the Troyans to obey, Nor do I seeke to be their king, but this, that ioyntly they, Unuanquisht nations may in euerlasting league abide. My selfe will gods, and reliques tende, Latinus warres shall guide, My fatherlaw his woonted crowne shall weare, my mates, they shall Build vp a towne for mee, and by Lauinias name it call. Thus lord Aeneas first, then next bespake Latinus old. His eyes to heauen he castes, and vp to starres his hands doth hold. Aeneas, by the same both land, and sea, and starres I sweare, And by Latonas impes, and Iane that faces two doth beare, The sun &amp; Moone are Latonas children.And power of gods infernall grim, and cruell Plutoes seates, Let Ioue heare this, that breakers false of leagues with thundre beates, I touch the altars here, and fiers that stand before vs all, And all the heauenly powers herof to record I do call, No day shall once this peace disturbe, or concord frustrate make, How ere the case do fall, nor cause mee willing it forsake, Not though the land into the sea he threw, and drencht vs all, Or should enforce the loftie heauen in Lymbo low to fall. Like as this Mace (for in his hand by chaunce a mace he had) Greene leafe shall neuer burgein more, nor spray, nor pleasaunt shad Since first in woods it grew, and from the stocke was cut away, Now roote it lackes, the knife did cause both leafe, and braunch decay, Somtime a tree, howbeit the workmans hand, the same in gold Hath now incloasd, and geuen it the Latine kings to hold. With suchlike words, among th?selues their leagues they stablish sure Amid the rout of all the lords, the beastes then sacred pure Within the flaming fiers they slay, and from them sprauling quicke Their trembling entrailes take, and altars heape with launces thicke. But now to Rutil crue this match right much vnmeete doth seeme, And straight with wauering mindes in sort perplext, herof they deeme. But chiefly when more neare their far vnequall strength they view. His secret walkings forth augments the same, and low he threw The image of one in feare.His eies on ground whilst he in sacring was, his heauy cheere, His hollow cheekes, and palenesse in his face that doth appeere. This talke when sad Iuturna saw, now more and more encrease, The common peoples harts now quailing from this league to cease, Into the thickest thronges in semblant of Camertes face, Whose stocke right noble was of graundsiers old, and fathers race, And name with vertue fraught, himselfe in armes of valient might, Into the thickest rankes she comes, enformd of all aright, And sundry rumours forth she blabs, and babling thus doth say. Is it not shame, O Rutils, things of so great waight to lay Upon the life of one? are not in numbre wee, or might Their matches? loe the Troyans all, and Archades in sight Here stand, the fatall armie, and Hetruria Turnus foe. Scarce haue they man for man, if them against in fight we goe. He to the gods aboue before whose altars now he praies By flickring fame shal flie, and liue in mouth of man alwaies. But we with losse of patiue soyle, proud lordes for to obay Shalbe constraind while lingring now here in the fields we stay. With suchlike words the souldiours minds with rage he kindleth sore, And murmour great through out the field encreaseth more, and more. The Laurent peoples mindes are changd, and Latines harts likewise, And those that late for truce from war, and saulftie did deuise Wish now for armes, &amp; couenantes all full faine would frustrate make, And on king Turnus ruthfull case compassion great do take. To this a greater thing Iuturna ioynes, from heauen on hie A signe she downe doth send, that nothing could be found wherby Th'Italians mindes she more might mooue, or more w? monsters guile. A false token fr? aboue, For why, the bird of mighty Ioue aloft on wing did toyle Amid the ayer, and fierce a shole of fearfull foules pursue, And twigging forth a pace fast on her flight the Egle flue. When sodenly she stoopt downe to the streame, and sousing feld A noble Swan to ground, and griping fast in talantes held. Th'Italian troupes their mindes herat erect, then all the rout Of foules from flight with noise returne (a straunge sight out of dout) And heauen with wings they do obscure, and thicke a cloud they make, And on their foe they fiercely set, and round the ayer they shake, And still so sore they him assault, till vanquisht with their might, For want of force he faintes, the pray out of his foote he quight Lets fall into the streame, and fast to skies doth take his flight. This warning great of gods the Rutils then with shout accept, And strait their handes prepare to fight, and forth Tolumnie lept A prophet proud that was, and first this this (? he) and cries Tis long for which I lookt, and with my selfe I did deuise. I both acknowledge, and embrace the power of gods, come all O Rutils, and with mee your captaine strait to battaile fall, Whom this vile stra?ger wretch in war like hartlesse birds doth feare, And all your shore along with wofull sword, and fier doth teare, He hence anon shal flie and to salt seas himself betake. Do you with one consent your rankes strait thicke in ordre make, And now your king forlorne by warlike prowes seeke to defend. A sodayn tumult.He said, and running forth his dart against his foes doth bend, Forth flies the whistling Cornell dart, and ayer doth swiftly part, Wherwith a clamour huge doth rise, the bandes with feare do start, And stout couragious harts through tumult great wax fiery wood. This whirling dart nine bodies faier of brethren where they stood By chaunce direct against, (whom faithfull spouse, a Tuscan bred, Unto an Archade, Gilippe bare of yore that her did wed) And one of them strake through the midst wheras his belt did sit, Which now away is torne, where fast the buckle holdes thong in bit, A noble youth of beutie braue, in glittring armour strong, And smit him through the ribs, and laid him downe the sand along. Then strait the valient brothers band with griefe accenst in ire, Some draw their naked swordes, and some their sturdy dartes require. And forth they headlong blindly run, and Laurent bandes anone On tother side do fast approch, and Troyans many an one In rankes right thicke forth flie, Agillini, and Archads braue, And all this only lust, to trie with dint of sword they haue. The altars downe they driue, a tempest sore of wepons flies, A troblous sturdy storme of iron and steele obscures the skies. The Latines strait snatch vp the Boules, and Censers burning bright. Latinus takes with gods repulst and foiled league, his flight. Some steedes from charrets do discharge, and mount on horses hie, And with sharpe swords drawne hent in hand forthwith do hast th? nie Messapus there, Aulestes king that princely crowne did beare Of Tyrrhens all, that passing greedy was the league to teare With courser stout doth ouerthrow, who yeelding back, doth fall, And (wretch) against the altars high behind that stood withall Both head, and shoulders smites, Messapus fierce strait thither flies, And with his launce much like a beame whilst there Aulestes cries, And humbly sues for life, from loftie steede hee wounds him sore, And thus he speakes: That sure is thine, this sacrifice before The Gods of greater valew is, then that was slaine of of yore. Th'Italians thither ran, and spoyles from carcas panting raught. Sir Chorinee a flaming brond from of the aultar caught, And to Ebusus cumming fast, whilst he prepaard to fight Into his face the brond he forst, his huge beard brent a light And swealing made a stinke, he followeth still, and by the lockes With lefthand held his foe, whom rosling and amazde he knockes Against the ground, and with his knee constraines him there to lie, And with his Fauchon strikes him in the side. Then by and by Sir Alsus sheapheard earst that was and fierce in voward fought With naked sword in hand, fast followes Podalire stoute, And large him lies vpon, whom Alsus with his sharpned axe Raughtbacke, fr? brow to chin with sturdy stroke right cleauing packs, Downe strait he falles, &amp; armour large with goareblood doth embrue Unto his eyes doth bitter rest, and deadly sleepe ensue, With still enduring night, and neuer more the day to view. But lord Aeneas vp his righthand held vnarmed quite, With open head, and to his mates he cried withall his might. Where run you sirs? what discord great doth thus your minds inuade? O stay your rage, the couenants all are drawne, and league is made. And I alonly lotted am King Turnus to assay, Let mee therwith alone, and all your feare expell away, With this righthand the league I stablish shall, and firmely tie, For by this sacrifice is Turnus due to mee to die. Amid this tale, and when these words scarce yet were spoken all, Behold a singing shaft, with fluttring feathers downe doth fall, Uncerten by whose hand forth shot, or by what force forth throwne, Aeneas is wounded with an arrow. Or what cha?ce Rutils praise hath brought, or els what god, vnknowne The glorie of so worthy deede lies hid in secret still, And no man for Aeneas wound himselfe be praised will. When Turnus saw from out the fight Aeneas to depart, His captaynes much dismaid, with sodein hope doth fierce forthstart, For steedes and tooles he calles, and proud by leaping mountes on hie Into his charret swift, and with his hands the raygnes doth wrie, And many a worthy man to death forth flying mad doth send, And many leaues for dead, some crusht with wheeles he brings to end, Or els in fight with darts forth flunge doth strike them in the back. Like as when blooddy Mars, in rage pricktforth doth make to crack The streames of Hebrus colde, and with his bucklar them doth tire, And now to battayle prest sends forth his steedes incenst with ire. They in the open playnes more swift then winde, their way do take, And with their stamping feete the vtmost coast of Thracie shake, And round about dame Dreads right dririe looke, and Angers face, With Treason ioyntly ioynd, the traine of Mars, the land do trace. Such one then Turnus quicke in thickst of throngs, his smoaking steeds Hotgoth, and (wofull case) at enmies death vauntes in his deeds. The swift horshooue a blooddy dew echwhere doth sprinkle round, And stampes the goary blood like morter mixt with sandy ground. Now Sthenelus, and Thameris, and Phole he throweth to death, Him meeting, and with him, him far, far both he reeues of breath Imbrasus sunnes, sir Glauke, and Lades, whom Imbrasus olde In Lycia fostred vp, and with like armour them did bolde, In fight at hand to trie, or flight on horse the windes to win. On totherside Eumedes forth flies fast, thickst throngs within, Eumedes slayne by Turnus.Right noble Dolons impe, in feates of armes a doughty knight, Like graundsier in his name, in hart and hand his father right. Who once for that to Greekish tentes a spie he should be sent, Achilles charret craaud to haue for paynes in trauaile spent. Howbeit Tytides gaue him other hire for ventred paine, His chaunce was not vnto Achilles horses to attaine. Whom Turnus when from far in open field did once espie, When first him had pursued with darts right light that fast did flie, His coupled horse he staies, and from his charret downe descendes, And to him dead almost, and throwne to ground he quickly tendes, His foote on necke he sets, with righthand forth his blade he drew, And deepely died it in his throat, and forth these wordes he threw. Lo here the fieldes, and which in war proud Troian thou hast sought Italia measure liyng now, such recompence is wrought To such as mee to war prouoke, so walles they do erect. Next him he Brutes laies, at whom a launce he did direct, Then Cloree stout of lym, Sibaris valient wight of hand, Daretus and Thersiloch fierce, that stiffe did him withstand, Tymoetus eke that on his necke from coltish iade downe fell. And as the northern Thracie winde (in semblantwise to tell) When forth it bloustring blowes, and deepe Ægeum sea doth rayse, The billowes forth do roule, and to the shoare do take their wayes As whirling windes do driue, the cloudes flit fast in heauen on hie: So Turnus where he takes his course the throngs fast thence do flie, And headlong troupes retire, a courage fierce him forth doth prick, The wauering ayre his flittring plumes beares back in creast y? sticke. This peartnes Phegee might not bide, nor pride of stomack bold, But to his charret steppes, and fomie raignes in hand doth hold Of swift forth running steedes, and turnes their heads another way Whilst proud he forth is drawn, and on their manes doth hanging stay: A mightie launce forth flung him groueling to the ground doth cast, And armour double lynd with plate through gorget thick doth brast, And pearcing to the quick, the vpmost skinne with wound is rast. But he with bucklar bent before his breast makes at his foe, And sharpe sworde drawne in hand for more assurance forth doth goe, Whom there the charret wheele downe dings, and axtree swift in flight Rhegee is slayne. Throwes to the ground, and Turnus chasing, soone doth downe alight, And twixt the gorget brim, where the helmet closelye stands His head he smites away, &amp; leaues the corps vpon the sands. These bloody slaughters fierce in field whilst Turnus victour wrought, Therwhiles Mnestee with good Achates both Aeneas brought Still bleeding to his tent, with yong Afcanius by his side, And leaning to a speare with limping pace doth slowlye stride. He frettes, and forcing striues the shaft and head forth whole to halle, And askes their best aduise, and fayn would know their iudgem?ts all, Where it were best the wound wide ope to launce, and arrow hid To cut quite out the flesh that so to warre returne they did. And now Iapis came to Phœbus deare the rest aboue, Iasus sunne, with whom surprisd sometime in feruent loue Apollo gladly gaue him gifts his arts that he should know In thinges to come, in Musicks sweete in skill of shafts and bow. Phisicke is without honor in y? field, where the destructi? not the health of men is sought. But he, the rather to prolong his bedred fathers dayes, Chose secret skill in power of hearbes, and Phisicks noble prayse, And such like knowledge dumb deuoyd of honour, to frequent. Aeneas chaufing stoode, and to a mighty launce him lent, With youths a troupe about him thick, and sad Iüle his sunne. He at their teares vnmooued stands, as earst he had begunne. Then auntient leach Iapis gyrds an apron him before Right Surgeonlike, and forth he fets his oyles, and salues in store, And eft he tries the powers of herbes, which him sir Phœbus tought, And trembling sundrie thinges applies, but all (God wote) for nought. And eft the sticking arrowhead with hand he doth assay, With nippers eke sometime from out the bones to draw away, But fortune will no way assigne, Apollo doth no good. And now the rage within the field still growing waxeth wood, And fierce doth more arise, and now the mischiefe comes at hand, And all the aire aboue with smoking dust full thick doth stand. The horsemen neare approch, and on the tents darts fast doe fall, A wofull shout of Souldiers to the heauens flies vp withall, Of some that fiercely fight, and some in fight that now be slaine. But Venus much appalde at this her sunnes vnworthy paine, Venus cureth her sunne.Greene Ditanie from Ida sacred mount in Creta brings, The stalke with tender leaues, and blossom purple fresh that springes, An hearbe to Roebuckes wild, and beasts not tame right welbeknown, Their backs wh? full of darts do stick which h?ters thick haue thrown. Disguysd in clowd obscure this hearbe Dame Venus thither brings, And into water vessels bright it secretly she flings, And steeping large thereof she makes, the vertue forth to take And of Ambrosies holesome, iuice therto doth sprinckling shake, Whereto she addes the fragrant sappe that Panax soote doth make. Anon the wound with this by chance Iapis auntient baynes Unwares hereof, and loe in sodaine sort, flie all the paynes From out his body quite away, the blood was stanched straight, And gently followeth the shaft with hands alonly waight, And by and by his former strength returnes to euery lim. Then quickly fetch his armour strong (Iapis cals) for him, Why stand you stille and first doth him incense against his foes. Not by mans helpe (Iapis cries) this cure thus forward goes, Tis not, Aeneas, my right hand that thee thus safe preserues, A greater god it is that thee to greater deedes reserues. He greedie then of fight his legges in golden armour ties All compast round, and lets he hates, then for his speare he cries. But when he fitted was of shield, and armd in euery place, All complete as he stoode, Ascanius yong he doth imbrace, And vp his beuer lift, and sweetely kossing, thus he spake. Learne courage stout of mee, my child, and perfite paynes to take. Of others happie chaunce to haue, this righthand shall defend A fathers exhortati? to the child. Thee in this warre, and after this to greater honours send. And see that thee when riper yeares haue made a perfite man, Thine auncetours most famous facts in mind thou carie than, Let sier Aeneas, and thine vnckle Hector thee incyte. When he these wordes had spoke, forth of the doores he walked right, Of mightie lim, and in his hand an hugie launce he bare, Then Antheus and Mnesthee both with thronging troupes forth fare. And all the routs do raking run and leaue the tents vnkept. A smoultring smoaking dust, along the campe with feete is swept. And all the ground about with weight of steps then trembling lept. Then Turnus saw him marching towards fast with great aray, Th'Italians eke beheld the same, and through their bones straightway A sodayne shiuering ran, Iuturna first of Latines side Perceauing knew the noyse, and sore affright away she hide. He flies him forth in open field, his hoast he leades apace, Much lyke a bloustring storme, that from the sea to land doth trace, When dropping cloudes dissolued fall, then husbandmen do wring, When long before (alas) they see what harmes the flaw will bring, For downe it turnes the trees to ground, and corne it layes along, And althing sweepes to earth, the windes before to shoares do throng, And cracking ratling sound do make, as ruffe they huffe about. Euen so his bandes agaynst his foes the Troyan captayne stout Leades forth, and they themselues in wedges thick doe flocking throw. To Thymbree there with sword Osirie lent a deadly blow. Sir Mnesthee then Archetie slew, Achates did behead Syr Epulo, and Gias sharpe sir Vfens left for dead. Then falles Tolumnie calcar slayne to ground, that first in hast, Ill counsel, worste to the co?seller. And furious frantick moode his dart agaynst his foes did cast. A yelling shoute then to the heauens they throw, and all affright The vanquisht Rutils turne their dustie backes in sodayne flyght. But he none dayning whom he meetes withall on ground to throw, On horseback none nor to inuade, nor yet on foote below Though flinging dartes they follow after fast, but he alone In midst of all the dustie mist, and thickest thronges ech one For Turnus seekes about, and him in combat doth require, Iuturna then Virago fierce, whose mind was set on fire With painting dread, her brother Turnus wagoner that hight Metiscus downe from out his place and charge she tumbleth quight, And from the Summer far away she leaues him on the ground, And vp she leapes, and lithie raignes with hand she turneth round, Resembling shape, and voice, and armour of Metiscus stout. Like as the swallow black, that stately courts doth flie about Of lords, and princes great, and lofty buildings largly tries, And for her pratling younge doth feeding seeke on gnats, or flies, Sumtime in entries wide, sumtime about deepe standing lakes, With tendre houering wings her skirring flight swift forward takes: So doth Iuturna through the thickst of foes her horses chase, And euery coast about with flying charret swiftly trace, Sumtime her brother here, and sumtime there she vaunting showes In quarters far and neere, nor lets him giue nor suffer blowes. No lesse Aeneas seekes with him to meete through crooked waies, And through his thickst astoined hoast, and quailed Latine rayes, And loud him calles by name so oft as him he hath in sight. And looke how oft he ment him to pursue with horses light, Iuturna keepeth her brother Turnus from meting w? Aeneas.So oft Iuturna strait the charret steedes away doth turne. Alas, what should he doo? his hart in vaine with rage doth burne, His pensiue minde is much distract with diuerse doubtfull cares. Messapus then that in his hand by chaunce so hapning beares Two lithie quiuering darts, well tipt with steele, ful swift of flight, The one he shaking gripes, and forth it flings with leuell right. Still stands Aeneas strait and to his shield him self doth fit Downe stouping low, howbeit the flying dart his helmet smit, And downe his lustie plume of from his creast to ground it threw. Then strait this rage arose, and courage great by Treason grew, The steedes when turnd awry he saw, and charret backward raught. Then Ioue, and altars all of broken league he there besaught. At last he throngs into the thickst, and there in lucky fight Right dreadfull blooddy slaughter makes, he spareth none in sight, And all incenst with ire, vnto his rage he gaue the raygnes, What god to mee will now at large this pine, and wofull paynes, And sundry slaughters sore, and death of dukes in verse vnfold, That were by Turnus made in course, and Troyan captayn bold? With such fell force these nations stout, O Ioue, was it thy wil They thus should meete that should hereafter liue in concord stil? Aeneas pausing nothing long but Sucro out of hand (That only stroke did cause the flying Troyans still to stand) He strake into the side, and where most speede of death doth rest, Between the short ribs deepe his sword he draue into his brest. Then Turnus turnes Amycus downe, and Diore by his side, Two Troyan brothers deere, and forth on foote to them doth stride, And at Amycus when he gan approch, a dart he threw. Diores with his sword he strake bright glittring which he drew, And both their heads he cut from corps, and blooddy sprincling yet, Upon his charret top with egre moode aloft he set. Aeneas Tale and Tanais slaies, and next Cethegus strong, All three at one assault, and sad Onytes liues not long Of Thebans auntient stock, and of Peridia mother deere. Then Turnus, brothers twaine from Lycia sent to Troy yfeere, Menætes eke Archadian youth, that war did feare in vaine, And neare to Lerna fishie brinckes an handycraft did traine. A simple house hee kept, and princes welth did neuer know, His father hired had a little lande, and that did sow. And like as flaming fiers that kindled are in diuerse wayes In drie and crackling woods, or on the boughes of ratling Bayes. The lus[illeg.] courage of Aeneas &amp; Turnus. Or as the swift, and foming streames from loftie hilles that fall A raging roaring raise, and forth to sea they run withall, Ech findeth out his way, and downe they driue whatso withstands: No slower forth Aeneas flies, and Turnus stout of hands, And both within the battaile bide, now now they feet with in, Their breasts w? courage brast, whose valient harts no force can win. And now to wound echothers folke they fret with deadly foode. Aeneas there, Murrhanus proud of graunsiers great that stoode, And antique names of noble Belsiers old was woont to showe, And Pedigrues far fet from all the Latine kinges arowe He reeues downe with a rocke, the stony tempest layes him lowe, And vnder horses feete and charret flings, the whirling wheele Him prostrate ouerrunnes, and steedes do stampe with shoes of steele, The swift forth flinging hoofe with mightie poyse oft strikes him hard, And of their master throwne to ground the horse take no reguard. Then Turnus with sir Hilus meetes that headlong running ran, And through his temples armd with gold his dart he forced than, The dart soone through the helmet flies, and strait in braines it steekes. No, not thy hand stout Cretes valienst most of all the Greekes From Turnus could acquight, nor yet Cupentus Gods him saue, When once Aeneas came in place, but soone his brest he gaue Direct agaynst Aeneas launce, the speare on him doth fall, Nought to the seely wretch his brasen shield preuayld at all. And thee likewise, sir Aeolus, Laurentum fieldes did see Aeolus is slayne.Quite ouerthrowne, and flatly prostrate on the ground to bee. There now thou lyest Grætian hoast whom neare could ouerthrow, Nor yet Achilles fierce, that Priams kingdome layd full low, This was thy time of death prefixt, nigh Ida thou wast borne, In Lyrnesse didst thou dwell, in Laurent fieldes thou liest forlorne. And now the armies all were bent, all whole the Latine rout, And al the Troian crue, Mnesthee, and sir Serectus stout. Messapus eke a tamer good of steedes, Asylas strong, And Tuscan rankes, and old Euanders swift Archadian throng, Eche man now for himselfe with all his might there doth his best. No stay, nor rest, to cruell fight eche one is ready prest. There, to Aeneas then his mother faire this mynd did send, That to the citie walles with speede he should his armie bend, And with a sodayne mischiefe all the Latines harts affright. Then while for Turnus round about the hoast he cast his sight, The towne he there beholds deuoyd of warre to stand at rest, And strait a greater force of warre doth kindle in his brest. For Mnesthee and Sergestus then he calles, and Serest strong His valyant captaynes all, and all the heape of Troyan throng Togither runs, he takes an hill, they shieldes nor weapons lay From out their hands, but from aloft to them thus gan to say. Let be no stay in that I bid, Ioue on our side doth stand, And sodayne though I charge, let none it slackly take in hand. This towne the cause of all the warre, and King Latinus land, Unlesse they do submit themselues, and graunt for to obay, I meane to sack, and rase vnto the ground this present day. Forsooth shall I attend till Turnus please with me to fight? And then agayne his leasure wayt, when he is vanquisht quight? This towne is cheefest cause, my mates, and head of all the sore, Goe set me fire at once, and do the league with flame restore. He sayd, and strayt with one consent a warlike wedge they make, The town assalted.And thick vnto the walles in clustring thronges they forth do rake. The ladders sodaynly appeare, and firebronds burning bright. Some runne vnto the gates, and whom they meet they slay downright, Some fling forth darts, and welkin hie with weapons do obscure. Aeneas there amongst the first his hand vpholding pure Unto the walles, doth much in wordes blame old Latinus king, And Gods to record calles, that they to warre agayne him bring, That twise Italians waxt his foes, and brake their couenants twise. Then strait among the citizens a discord great doth rise. Some bid vnlock the towne, and open wide the gates to set To call the Troyans in, and king Aeneas in to set, Some armour take, and still persist the walles for to defend. Like as a swarme of Bees that in a rock deepe hollow pend, By chance some sheapheard glad hath found, and bitter smooke applies: They fearefull then within, about through waxen castels flies, And with hot humming sound themselues to anger do prouoke, Out flies from forth their hole apace in heapes the filthie smoke, The hollow caue beneath with noyse confusde doth rumbling sound, Which into open ayre abroad at last doth brim rebound. Unto the Latines ouer this a misaduenture great Befell, that all the towne with teares, and sorrowe did repleat, For when the Queene beheld the foe to draw the citie nie, The walles to burne, and vp to loftie houses fire to flie, No power of Rutils neare at hand, nor Turnus to resist, Unhappy dame, that Turnus had bene slayne in fight she wist. And mated much in mind with grieuous feare, she cries, alas, That of these mischiefes all herself the cause, and worker was. And all with ruthfull rage incenst, she blabbes forth many tales, And dyingripe with nayles her purple robes in ragges she hales. Then on a beame within the pallaice hie a cord she ties, Amata hangeth herself. And hanges herself thereon, and (fie for shame) there so she dies. Which wofull chaunce, when once the Latine women vnderstoode, And first Lauinia bright, her daughter deere, as frantick wood Her golden lockes she rent, and roset cheekes with nayles she tare, And all the rout in semblantwise right frantickly did fare. The houses nie with noyse resound, and all the towne about This wofull flame doth flickering fleete within and eke without. Their courage they let fall, his princely robes Latinus rents, His hoarie head (good man) and auntient beard with durt he sprents Amazed at his Ladies death, and at the cities fall. And grieued much, himself he blames, that he did neuer call Aeneas to him prince of Troy, his sunne in law to bee. Therwhiles lord Turnus warriar stout, in open fields doth see A few poore scattred souldiers whom he slowly doth pursue, For why his steedes with courage lesse to run he now doth view. A corsey to TurnusThere to his eare a doubtfull noyse the whirling ayre hath braught. He listning stoode, and with attentiue eare the sound he raught Of Laurent sacked towne, and of their pitious clamour thoe. Alas, why is the citie thus dismayd with grieuous woe? Or what great outcrie might this be that doth the citie rayse? He sayd, and therwith welnigh mad, the charret raignes he stayes. To whom his sister then, as the Metiscus countnance bare, And of his running charret raygnes, and steedes had tane the care, With these like words replies. Nay rather let vs follow now The Troyans, Turnus, here, where conquest ginnes on vs to bow, There others are that with their handes the citie will defend. Aeneas on Italians sets, and cruell force doth bend, Let vs likewise with slaughter vile the Troyans make to smart, So thou with equall number slayne, and honour shall depart. Whereto thus answerd Turnus then. O sister deare, I knew ere this how thou by subtile slight The league didst ouerthrow, and threwest thy self into this fight. And now in vayne thou seekste me to deceaue, O Goddesse pure. But who from heauen thee downe to come, such trauels to indure Requested, such aduentures wild to bide, and vncontrould? Was it because thy brothers wretched death thou wouldst behold? For where about now do I go? what chaunce may me betide? That to my rent, and torne estate some succour may prouide? My selfe Murrhanus saw of late that me by name did call, Who whilst he liued was to me the best beloued of all, Of limme a mighty man, and slayne likewise with mighty wound. Unhappy Vfens eke, lest he our shame should see, on ground Now dead he lyeth, the Troyans both his corps, and armes enioy. The houses spoyld (that mischief yet remaynd, and great anoy) Shall I abide to see? and Drances wordes not prooue vntrue? Deepe desperation.And shall this ground faintharted dastard Turnus flying viewe? Is it so vile a thing to die? O hellish hegges below Come help I pray for heauenly powers no fauour me will stow. To you my soule deuoyde herein of crime shall downe descend No deale vnworthie of the graundsiers great of all my kend. Scarce had he sayd, when loe sir Sages lockt on foming steede, Flies through the thickest foes, whose face deepe wo?ded sore did bleede With dint of arrow falling swift, and thus he crying spake. In Turnus, thee, is all our hope, on thine some pitie take, Aeneas rageth now in armes, and threatneth to confound One mischief cummeth on y? backe of another. The turrets of Italia land, and citie burne to ground. And now the fire to houses flies, the Rutils bend their eyes On thee, and all the seely Latine power doth so likewyse. Latinus king is much in doubt, and murmour great doth make, Whom he may cal his sunne in law, or what league he may take. And ouer this, the Queene most true to thee, her death hath wrought With her owne cruell hand, and light of life esteemde at nought. Before the gates Messapus strong, ioynt with Atinas stout Alone sustayne the force, and all the rankes them round about Do stand full thick, and yron throngs of dartes do daunt their face, And thou thy charret here alone in desert fieldes dost trace. Then Turnus at the diuerse shape of dangers stoined staid, And downe his eyes he kest to ground, and whusting nothing said. And there at once great griefe and shame his heauie hart doth freat Deepe lodgd within, and madnesse mixt in breast with sorrow great, And loue incenst with rage, and priuie touche of enmies might. But when from mind he darknesse draue, and brought agayn the light, His flaming eyes with yre vnto Laurentum walles he rold, And from his charret hie the goodly towne he did behold. When loe the flashing flames aloft the battlements had caught Of Turnus noble tower, and vp to heauen they crackling raught. A tower right strong of wood, the prince himselfe it built alone, And choules had vnderlayd, and ladders made to mount thereon. Ah sister (then ? he) my death drawes neare hold thee content, Hee becummeth desperate. Where gods, and spitefull fortune call, to follow I full am bent, And with Aeneas hand to hand to meete, and what our payne Augmenteth else with losse of lothsome life, that to sustayne. And, sister, after this thou shalt not see me play the part Of coward knight, but giue me licence now with all my hart I the beseech, before my finall rage, to rage a while. He sayd, and as his raging mind with inward wrath did boyle, From charret downe into the open fieldes his leape he takes, And forth through foes he throngs, his sister sad he there forsakes, And through the thickst of all the hoast holdes on his frantique pace, And on ech side the ray of enmies rankes he doth displace. Like as a rocke that from a loftie mount doth headlong fall Enforst with rage of wind, or els with shoures, and water gall. Or when long yeeres with auntient tract of time the hold doth lose The hugie hill falles downe with wondrous force, and foorth it goes, And proudly springs on ground, and woods, and beastes, and men, and all Before it tumbling turnes, and rouling runnes forth like a ball So through his vanquisht hoast forth Turnus mad in hast doth flie, Where all the ground about with blood doth deepely drenched lie, And whirling deadly dartes in th'ayer aboue do make a cloud. He beckeneth with his hand, and with his mouth thus crieth aloud. Stay stay O Rutils now, and Latines hold your hands, no more, What euer chaunce befall, tis due to mee though it goe sore. Tis meeter I the broken league with smart deseru'd should hie, And in your steed myself a lone with blade the quarrell trie. They draw now to the combat.They strait withdrew th?selues, and roomth they made him by &amp; by. But lord Aeneas, Turnus name whence once in eare he tooke, The sturdy citie wals, and turrets high hee then forsooke. And lingring laied aside, and all attemptes left out of hand, Hee leapes for ioy, and thundring there doth great in armour stand, As much as Athos mount, or Erix hill, or rough with wood, And whom with snowie top all yeere to stand it doth him good Old Appeninus hill, that to the lofty cloudes doth rise. Then Rutils all, and Troyans all do bend their heedfull eies, And all Th'Italian troupes likewise, both those the walles on hie That keepe, and those with engins great to breake the walles that plye, And armour downe from shoulders lay. Latinus mased stands, When such two mighty men he sees of lim, so stout of hands, In places so far distant borne meete there with so great might, And fully bent their force to trie in single handed fight. Then they when first in empty field ech other gan to view, With trauerse swift about, ech one his dart at other threw. Then strait to hand they come, their swords and targates meeting dash, There might you here y? gro?d to grone, their blades w? blowes do clash Thickedubled fet, good chaunce, and prowis fast ioynt in one are mixt, And like as when contention falles two mighty Bulles betwixt, On top of hugie Syla mount, or hill Tabernus hie, That for dominion euermore, and mastership do trie, With hornes they do inuade, the fearfull keepers stand aside, And all the flocking heard about deepe silent doth abide, The hefers mumbling soft do make, who now shall rule the roast, And whom the heard shall follow as they feede about the coast. They with all force, with mortall wound ech other seeke to smight, And with their perlous crooked hornes alone is all their fight. Their foule black reaking blood, with channel large doth fall to ground, And necke &amp; shoulders bathes, the wood with noyses loud doth sound. None otherwise Aeneas fierce, and stout lord Turnus meete With targates redy bent, and round the ayer with noise repleete. Then Iupiter in heauen aboue in equall balaunce wayghes Their destnies both, and from his sentence graue a while he stayes. And vnto either diuerse chaunce alots, who shall endure Moe trauailes hard, and who the present death to die is sure. There Turnus vauntes himself and hoping well, with all his might A sturdy blow he sets, and on his toes he riseth right. The stroke lightes home; the Troyans shout, y? Latines shake for feare, And both the armies roundabout amaazd stand gaping there. But loe, the false and brittle sword is broke, and at that blowe His Maister quite deceaud, and broad in sliuers small it flowe, Turnus sword broke in peeces. And quite vndoone he was, had not he tane himself to flight. Thence fast he flies more swift then winde, beholding there in sight A straunge sword hilt, his stout righthand likewise of weapon bare. Report doth goe, that when to battle first he did prepare, And mounted first his charret hie forst forth with feare and ire, His fathers sword he then mistooke, and as hast did require His wagoner Metiscus sword for his he tooke in steede, Which while the Troyans slie in fight, ful well perfourmd the deede. But when to armour made by god Vulcanus come it was, The mortall sword at first flew broken strait like brickle glasse And litle shiuers round about lay shining in the grasse, There Turnus in his flight, the broad wide fieldes do trace about, Now here he turnes, now there, and courses round fets in and out. On euery side a ring of Troyans thicke incloase him round, Here standes the citie wall, there lyeth a vale of fennie ground. No lesse Aeneas then (howbeit full deepe with arrow smit His faultring failing knees him fast to runne will not permit) Him after hies, and foote to foote at heeles him vrgeth nie. Like as the Deare, that to the pleasaunt soyle apace doth hie, And there in meash of hugie net entrapt, doth quaking feare, When hunter rough with crie of cruell hounds fast draws him neare. He at the sturdie toyle, and bankes full hye right sore agast, A thousand wayes doth turne and wend, the noble hound doth hast And gaping comes at heeles, and now doth pinch, or like to pinche He snoppes his iawes, and is deceaud his bit by halfe an inche. Then riseth round a shout, that shoares and lakes the same rebound, And all the heauen about with thumping thundre doth resound. Then Turnus flying fast his Rutils all doth sorely blame, He would fain haue his owne sworde.And for his tryed sword he cals to euery one by name. Aeneas present death doth threat, and great destruction there If any do approch, and them still trembling more doth feare, And threatneth sore the citie towne to rase vnto the ground. And still (though wounded) draweth him neare, and now fiue courses round About they finisht had, and back fiue courses had begunne Both this way now, then that, nor for no trifle tis they runne, But for King Turnus life they striue (alas) and for his blood. By chaunce thereby with bitter leaues an Oliue wild there stoode, Which vnto Faunus God auowred was, a ioyfull tree Where such as safe from shipwrack foule, and drenching saued bee Are woont their offrings vp to hang, and garments knowne at full. This tree without respect at all the Troyans vp did pull, That without let wherein to fight the whole field they might haue. There stuck Aeneas dart, him force in casting thither draue, The roote it holding fast he bends him downe, and there assayes Thereout to pul the speare, to cast at Turnus on his wayes As forth he skuddes, whom he in running could not ouertake. Then Turnus raging mad with feare, his prayer thus gan make. O Faunus pitie take I pray (? he,) thou worthie Ground Hold fast the dart, your honours if I euer saued sound, Whom otherwise Aeneas crue by warre haue made profayne. He sayd, and to the goods his sute he did not make in vayne. For though he striuing much at clunged stemme long time did stay, Yet by no strength Aeneas could his speare pull thence away. Thus whilst he fiercely forcing stands, and still doth pluck and straine, Into the wagoner Metiscus shape transfourmd againe Iuturna faire, his sword vnto her brother doth restore. That Venus at this Nymphes so bold attempt disdaining sore, Drew neere, and from the roote beneath the dart she plucked out. Then they with weapons armed both, and waxt with courage stout, This trusting sword, the other fierce with speare Aeneas bent Enraged both, with deadly fude ech one at other went. Therwhiles th'almighty king to Iuno speaking thus he told, Iupiter speaketh to Iuno. That from a yellow cloud aboue, the battell did behold. What shall the end herof be wife? what now remaineth? say. Aeneas is a god thou knowest, thy selfe canst not denay, And that to heauen he longs, and to the starres to be extold, What doost thou worke? or in what hope abidste in clouds so cold? For is it meete a god with mortall wound defilde should bee? Or els (for what Iuturna could she do were not for thee?) The sword restoard to Turnus bee, and force to vassalles grow? Leaue of at last at our request, lay downe thy courage low, Nor let such priuie Rancor fret thee more, this care and smart Let them (good Iuno) from thy sweete and pleasaunt mouth depart. Wee to the last are come, the Troyans vexe by sea and land Thou mightst, and blooddy wicked warres to raise was in thine hand, And houses to deface, and monefull mariages to make, But farther to attempt I thee forbid. Ioue thus bespake, And goddesse Iuno with a louly countnance thus replied. Almighty spouse, since first your heauenly pleasure I espied, Iuno answereth Iupiter. Both Turnus, and the earth, and all I left against my will. He should you see me now in ayer alone to sit so still, And suffre thus such worthy vnworthy things, but armd in fier In thickest throngs would thrust, and on the Troyans wreake mine ire. Iuturna I confesse her brother sad I causd to aide, And for his life (alas) I bid what could, should be assaid. Yet weapons none I wild her take, nor yet to bend her bowe, I sweare by dreadfull springs, whence streame of Styx along doth flowe, The only true, and dreadfull oth that heauenly gods do make. And now I do giue place, and lothsome warres I quite forsake. But yet this one thing now, which destnies course doth not denay For honours sake of thine, and for all Latium graunt I pray. That when (wherto I yeeld) in perfect peace they wedlockes knit, And holsome lawes appoint, with lasting leagues of frindship smit, Of Latine old inhabitours thou wouldst not chaunge the name, Nor Troyans to be cauld, nor Teucers yet permit the same, Nor let th? chaunge their speech, but weare their weedes they ware of yore, Let Latium still abide, and Albane kings for euermore, Let Romane ofspring be of power through great Italian might, Troy downe is falne, and with the name now let it perish quite. To whom the king of gods and men thus answered smiling milde. Thou art my sister deere, and old Saturnus second childe, Why doost thou then such hugie waues of rage roule in thy breast? But goe to, from this late sprung griefe set whole thy hart at rest. I graunt thy sute, and willingly therto I do agree. Ausonians their tongue shal keepe, and customes as they bee, And as it is their name shall byde, in body only mixt Shall Troians bee, no diffrence more them both shalbe betwixt. Their maners, and their sacred rites I will appoint them all, And I will cause all nations still they Latines them shall call. This stocke that of Ausonian blood commixt shal shortly rise, In vertue men shall passe, and passe the gods that dwell in skies. Unto thee honour doe no nation shall so much as thay. Dame Iuno gaue a nod, and glad her minde she turnes away, And from the aier departes, and leaues the cloud where she did stay. When this was done, the father of Gods a new deuise doth proue, The Furies are childr? of the NightHow from her brothers aide Iuturna Nimphe he may remoue. Two wofull plagues there beene, that by right name men Furies call, Whom with Megæra hellish heg Night darck, and dreadfull, all At one birth brought to light, and with like stings of serpents fell Them all did arme, and like winges gaue that shift windes do excell. These Ioue before, and in the seat of Pluto dreadful king Attending stand, and wofull feare to mortall men do bring If dryrie death at eny time, or sicknes vile to beare Ioue do commaund, or cities naught with bloodie warres to feare. Of these then one from heauen Ioue downe doth send with speedy flight, And to Iuturna with yll lucke bids flie her to affright. Away she goes, and vnto earth with whirlewind flitteth fast, Noneotherwise then when a shaft swift forth with bowstring cast In deadly poyson dipt, through clouds apace doth skudding fling, Which mortall shaft some Parthians bow enforst, or Cydons string, The singing toole through shadow flies, that none perceaue it may: So went this child of Night, and so to earth she tooke her way. When Troyan host at hand, and Turnus troupes she did espie, Transfourmed to a foule herselfe she chaungeth by and by, Such as are woont on grisly graues, and desert roufes to sit By night, and in the dare their wofull tunes do charme, and chit. She turneth her selfe to a Shritch-Owle. To this foule forme thus turnd, at Turnus fare she skirring cries, And strikes his targat with her winges, as here and there she flies. This new feare then his drouping lims with dread did cause to quake, His heare rose vp an end, his trembling voyce in iawes fast stake. But when the Furies hatefull shritch from far, and wings she knew Iuturna wofull wight, her heare from of her head she drew, And with her nailes her face she rent, with hands she beat her breast. Ah Turnus now (? she) what may she do that loues the best? What way may now thy sister worke, or what meanes is so strong, Iuturnas c?plaint. That I may practise it, thy wofull life for to prolong? Myselfe against such monsters to oppose am I of might? Nay nay, the battayle now I leaue, nor mee with feare affright Do any more you filthy foules, and begs of Limbo low, Your hellish sound, and clapping of your wings I well do know. And well I wot the proud beheastes of Ioue so great of might, Now for my Maydenhood bereft doth he me thus requight? Why gaue he mee eternall life, and death did take away? So that by mortall end these lasting griefes I might delay, And with my brother deere now downe descend to shadowes dead, If like as he (which would to God) a mortall life I lead. No pleasure of my pleasures all shall pleasant be to mee O brother Turnus deere, and all for lacke, and losse of thee. What ground (alas) will gape below my corps therin to take, And bring mee downe (a Goddesse though I be) to Lymbo lake? This much she said, and strait her head in mantell blue she hid Sore sighing, and anon she threw herselfe the streame amid. Aeneas forcing forth a mighty speare in hand doth shake Of sturdy timber framde, and with great courage thus he spake. What staying now is this? why, Turnus, doost thou lingre thus? In flight wee must not striue, but neare at hand in fight I wus. Transforme thyself to euery shape, or els thy best assay By force of armes, or els by craft to rid thyself away. Or wish vnto the lofty starres by flittring wings to flie, Or couerd els within some hollow caue in ground to lie. He shaking then his head, not these thy bitter words do mee Ought make a feard, but gods me fray, and Ioue my foe (? hee.) He said no more, but strait a mighty stone he there behelde, A mighty auntient stone, that then by chaunce within the felde There for a Bounde did lie, all strife twixt lands for to appease. Scarce could twelue chosen men that on their shoulders lift with ease, Such men I meane, as now a dayes the earth to light doth bring. This vp in hand he caught, and at his foe doth fiercely fling Ary[illeg.]ng vp therwith, and forth his vease he fet withall. But he nor when he came, nor when he went to minde doth call, Or when he lifted vp his hand, nor when the stone he threw. His knees do fayle, and through his blood a chilly shiuering flew. The stone then rowling through the empty ayer his way did take, But forth at full it did not flie, nor yet the marke it strake. And like as in a dreame when sleape by night hath cloasd our eies, Sometimes in vaine great coursers foorth to run wee do deuise, And in the midst of all our force anon begin to fayle, Our tongue is tied, &amp; through our body quite our strength doth quayle That make no noise we can, nor able are one word to say. To Turnus so, what euer manfull meanes he doth assay, Successe the cruell Furie doth deney. Then in his minde A thousand thoughts arise, his eies he backe doth cast behinde, And on the Rutils, and the Towne he lookes, and doubtes for feare, And trembles when he thinkes at hand to come the fatall speare, Nor knowes which way to wend, nor how against his foe to flie, His charret nor his charret guide he can no where espie. Whilst thus he doubtes, Aeneas forth his speare doth shake in sight, And vauntadge watcheth with his eie, and strait with all his might, Afar he flings it forth. Not so doth cast the hugie stones The engin great, that walles of townes to breake is made for nones. Nor with such clap y? lightning bright fr? heauen high foorth doth brast. The murdring speare fierce flies, and whirlwindlike, doth flit as fast, And through his armour braue of proofe it beats, through bucklar bright With seauen thick lininges layd, into the thigh it strake him quight. Then Turnus wounded downe to ground with dubled knees doth fal. The Rutils wofull shoutes doe rayse, and round the hilles withall Resounding make, and all the woods the noyse beat back agayne. He then on ground, his yeelding eyes, and hand of pardon fayne Entreating vp doth hold, and sure I haue deseru'de (? hee) Nor pardon aske I none, vse now thy chaunce at will on mee. But if regard of aged sire, thy mind sumdeale may tuch, (For vnto thee of late thy father Anchises old was such,) Upon king Daunus auntient yeares do thou some pitie take, And me, if so thou meane deuoyde of vitall life to make, Restoare vnto my friendes, for thou hast wunne, these hands of mine The Latines saw to yeelde, and faire Lauinia now is thine, No farther let thy rage proceede. Fierce there in armes did stand Aeneas casting down his eyes, and still he stayd his hand. And more and more the gentle speeche to swage his minde began: When loe, (alas) the lucklesse Belt that on his shoulders than Aloft with buckles glittring bright with gold that garnisht were Appeared, which he knew right well, that Pallas young did beare, Whom Turnus with a mightie wound had slayne not long before, And now the pillage of his foe vpon his shoulders wore. But when with eyes those tokens great of greefe he did behold And spoyles with rage incenst, in furie wood, and vncontrold, Ah wretch (? he) thinckst thou, that wearing spoyles of mine, from mee Thou so shalt scape? Now Pallas with this wound, now Pallas thee Doth offer vp, and on thy wicked blood reuenge doth take. This saying, deepe him to the hart with naked sword he strake Disoluti? of life. Incenst with ire, the natiue heat his limmes doth strait forsake, His ghost flies fast with greefe, and great disdayne, to Lymbo lake. DEO GRATIAS. Finitum Londini, Per Thomam Twynum 6. Iulij. 1573. Opus 20. Dierum plus minus, per interualla temporum. THE THIRTENTH BOOKE of Æneidos, supplyed by Maphæus Vegius Laudensis. The Argument. So soone as Aeneas had slayne Turnus, The Rutilians submitting themselues are receiued into the mercy of the Conquerour, not without deserued reproches for resisting the prouidence of the Gods, concerning his arriuall and setling in Italy. Then Aeneas taketh Pallas belt fr? about Turnus, which was partlye the cause that he slue him, determining to send it for a token to king Euander. After this honour being duly perfourmed to such as wer slain in fight, Aeneas congratulateth to his sunne Iulus and mates, their happie victories, and quiet peace purchased at last, after so many tempestes and troubles. But king Latinus bewayling the death of Turnus, with confutation of the fond enticements of Ambition, and vncerteinty of honour and kingly estate, sendeth the dead body vnto Daunus his father, who most pitifully lamenteth the rashnesse and haplesse successe of his sunne, as also the destruction of his citie Ardea, which being consumed with fire, is transformed into a byrd of that name. Immediately Latinus sendeth Oratours vnto Aeneas, Drances being cheefe, who after discommendation of Turnus whom he hated, and the excuse of king Latinus touching the breache of couenants, desireth him into the citie and pallace, where with great solemnitie Latinus coupleth vnto him in mariage Lauinia his daughter, and only childe, both Troyans and Italians muche reioycing at this legue of amitie. Shortly after, Aeneas buildeth a citie, whiche by the aduise of his mother Venus, hee calleth after his wiues name: and king Latinus dying, hee succeedeth him in the crowne and gouernment. And when he had raigned full three yeares, his mother Venus clensing him from contagion of mortalitie in the riuer Numicius neare Laurentum, she carieth him vp into heauen, and translateth him into the number of the starres. When Turnus in this finall fight downethrowne, his flittring ghost Had yeelded vp into the aire, in middest of all the host The representation of m? disc?fited in battell. Aeneas valient victour stands, god Mauors ch?pion bold. The Latines stoynisht standing, from their hartes great groanes vnfold, And deepely from their inward thoughts reuoluing cause of care, Their daunted minds they do let fall: Like as thick woods that are Of bignesse huge, lament their losse when first their leaues do fall Through furious force of northren blastes, of greene that spoiles th? all. Their weapons then on ground they pight, and on their swords do rest, And from their shoulders lay their shieldes, and battle do detest. The frantike loue of warre, ere while well liked, now they hate. No pleasure of the victour they refuse, nor captiue state. But pardon craue, and rest require, all mischiefes to abate. Like as when two couragious Bulles togither run in fight, With stoare of blood redoubling stripes, the heards there prest in sight As they pertayne, enclyne ech to their bull, but if one quayle, They earst which lou'de their foyled guide, to him that did preuayle Submit themselues, &amp; though great greefe their harts no doubt possesse, Do willingly yeeld vp themselues as subiects naithelesse: The Rutils so, though sorrowes great their harts did then molest, Through feare of thus their captayne slayne, in mind did then protest. The victour armes for to pursue, and Troyan Duke obey, And leagues to craue, and peace eterne from warres for to enioy. On Turnus corps Aeneas sitting then, thus mildly spake. What furie great from modestie thy minde so madly brake, That Troyans by the heastes of Gods, and doome of Ioue on hie Ariuing here, thou wouldst not let to dwell in Italie, O Turnus, but in vayne from promisd houses wouldst expell? Learne Ioue to feare, and what the Gods do will, to like that well. The punishmente of periurye. For mightie Ioue in wrath will burne, and what thing worthye blame Is done, the Gods will not forget for to reuenge the same. Loe here the end of all thy rage, whereby gaynst faith and right Disturbing leagues, the Troyan bands thou didst prouoke to fight. Loe here the finall day, which vnto such as shall be borne In time hereafter may a mirrour be, not Ioue to skorne That they presume in vayne, and hatefull broyles of warres to breede. But in thine armour now reioyce: A noble corps indeede Here Turnus dead thou liest, but yet Lauinia cost thee deare. Ne shame that with Aeneas hand yslayne thou liest heare. Now Rutils hence conuay your Lord, his armour, and the man I franckly yeelde, do honours to the dead the best ye can. As for the weightie belt, which vnto Pallas did belong, To king Euander will I send, that comfort great among For death of foes he may conceiue, and ioy for Turnus slayne, And you Ausonians these thinges repose in mindfull brayne, Henceforth to learne some iuster cause of battaile to ensue. By starres I sweare, that neuer feild nor armes I did pursue In willing minde, but forced foorth through this your frantick moode, With Troyan strength your headlong force at wish and wil withstoode. Aeneas sayd no more, but to the loftie walles with cheare His steppes did turne, and to the Troyan houses drew him neare. Him after all the troupe of Phrigian youth reioycing trace, And wightfull steedes with force of nimble foote prick forth apace: Reprouing sore the Latines all by dastardes loathsome name, Thanks to God to be yielded before dutie to m?.With shouts and noyses great, that ayre and skies resound the same. And though the bodies yet vntombde to burne with great desire Within his mind doth rise, and his dead mates to waste with fire: Aeneas yet reuoluing greater matters in his brest, To yeeld the Gods their honours first right due he deemde it best. Then Heickfers fat, as countries guise hath taught, forthwith they kil, And hogges they cast on heapes, and sheepe they driue the temples til, And tr?pled earth with streames of blood shead forth they purple staine, And intrailes forth they pluck, &amp; from the flock their felles they straine, And corpses forth they cut, and broches lay to rost at fire. Then wine in boules they forth do fill, as custome doth require. And gifts to Bacchus vp do heape, and with full cuppes adore His sacred alters fuming fat with cense and flesh good store. Then in the houses shoutings loude they make, and Ioue betweene They doe extoll, and Venus thee, and thee O Iuno Queene More friendly and more louing now with great prayse they confesse. And Mars himselfe, and all the troupe of Gods both more and lesse Are there recited, and with laud extolled to the skie. But Lord Aeneas peere of price to all the standers bie, His doubled handes in humble wise did stretche into the aire, And clasping fast his childe hee spake thus to Iülus faire. O sunne, thy fathers only hope, whom through distresses strange My selfe haue led, with destnies diuerse drawne enforst to range. Loe, rest at length is found, loe now that day the last of payne And troubles great that bringes an ende, most pleasant now we gaine. Which day most wished still, when me to warres hard happe did call, By Gods good will, I know, to thee I oft did tell, would fall. And now when first the morning bright shall shine with purple weede, Unto the Rutil walles I thee will send aduancde indeede. Then to the Troyan nation next he turnd and deepe from out His brest these words he drew, and mildly spake to all the rout. O Mates, y? through sharp dangers thick &amp; oft haue past, through broyls Recitall of calamities meketh rest the more pleasaunt Of warres so great, through winters many fierce and bitter toyles, Through what was fearefull, greeuous, wofull, huge, and what vniust, Unfortunate and cruell too, pluck vp to better lust Your minds as now, the ende is come, heere shall that end be fixt Of mischiefes all, and wished peace be setled vs betwixt And these the men of Latium. Then shall Lauinia deere My wife, whom I in battaile fierce haue woon, to Troyans cheare Aduaunce our stock with Itayle blood commixt to bide for aye. This one thing Mates, the Ausonians, with equall minds, I pray, To beare and vse, and eke my sire in law Latmus King For to obay, for he the scepter shall enioy, this thing I haue determined in minde: but you in warres and fight Learne godlinesse of me, and trace therein my steppes aright. What glory great is gaynd thereby to vs, you playnly see. But by the heauen and glittring starres I sweare, eterne that bee: I that preserued haue your liues before from dangers hard, Will after this requite your toyles with greater far reward. Such talke he treated then, and sundry chances in his brest Forepassed did reuolue, not smally reckoning of his rest Through trauaile late obtaynde, and tender loue in brest he bare Unto his Troyans, whome to haue escapte from dangers rare He did reioyce. And like the Hen her broode that clucking guides, When in the ayre a kyte that soaring round in compasse glides She doth espie, which stouping swift to ground with greedy bill The carefulnes of Aeneas by comparison. With furie seekes to pray, and threatneth all the birds to kill. The combed Dame then touchte at heart, doth streit herselfe aduaunce, Affrighted with the sodayne feare, and chickens heauie chaunce. She whets her bill, and with her greatest force withstands her foe, Untill with sturdie strength she make him voyd away to goe. Then cackling thence, she hasts to seeke th? earst disturbde with feare, And flockes them much amazde, such loue she to her younge doth beare. None otherwise Anchisus sunne with words, and gesture milde The Troyans did appease, while former feares, and dangers wilde Outworne he doth reuolue in minde, and ioyes by troubles long, Obteyned yet at length, which though in bearing bread him wrong In former times, the memorie thereof yet bringes delight. But Lord Aeneas farre excelling all in vertue bright, Due thankes vnto the Gods for gifts receiued earst he payes, And Iupiter almightie God extolles with worthie prayse. Therwhiles the great and wofull corps, the Rutils thick in throng, Duke Turnus bodie dead haue brought to towne in pompe along With heauie harts perplext, and sheading streames of trickling teares. The clamour great with greefe had filled soone Latinus eares All tired now, and casting sundry chances in his brest. Who after that he heard the mone encrease with mournefull quest, And Turnus with a mightie wound yslayne did there behold, His teares he could not stay, but meekely al the troupe controld. And with his handes and speeches sad deepe silence did commaund. And like as when the foming boare with tuskes fierce forth that stand, Some noble Hound the cheefe of all the kennell, through hath stuck, The barking crue doth back retire dismayd with dreadfull luck, And thronging thick about their maister round do make their mone, And houlings great send forth with dread and greefe commixt at one. But then the maister holding vp his hands and bidding hush, Their noyse they straight restrayne, and silent sit at present push. The Rutils so, in voices whust did inward sorrow presse. Then king Latinus shedding teares, his words thus to adresse Fr? heart deepe drawn began. What troubles great, what often change He bewaileth the inconst?cie of Fortune, and the tickle estate of honour.Do mens affaires assay, &amp; tosse their minds with whirlewind strange? O foolish fancie fayne to rule, and scepters brittle pride. O frantike madnesse graft in men desirous realmes to guide. To what distresse doost thou enforce mens blinded harts to run, And glorie got with dangers great our puffed minds to wun? How many treasons, deaths, and perils dread of mischiefes fell, How many gleaues and swords before thine eyes (if thou couldst tell) Attending wait on thee? O deadly poyson dulcet sweete, And worldly honours pestilent. O wofull trauayles meete For such as crownes do weare, that cost them deare, and heauie sway Of charge, which neuer suffers them to liue a merry day, Nor any time of rest permits. O wofull princely state, And miserable chaunce of kinges subiect to dread and hate. What hath it, Turnus, thee auaild the whole Ausonian land With tumultes great to stur, and Troians armd thus to withstand? And to infringe the couenantes fixt of sacred peace and rest? Whence could so great impatience inuade thy seely brest? That warres with stocke of Gods, by will of high Ioue hether brought Wouldst make, &amp; from our seates, prouoking vs, to driue hadst thought? And causde my daughter breake the faith to lord Aeneas sworne, And warres to raise, which I gainsaying, should haue bin forborne? What madnes great thy senses so did sot? How often thee To batteill prest, and mounted faire, all glittring bright to see, Haue I assayd to stay, thy iourney purposde to restraine, And fearing blamed haue thee parting oft, but all in vaine. Herof my gaines the citie shewes with houses halfe downe rent, Discommodities of war. And mighty feildes about with Latine snowhite bones besprent. And Latium spoild of all the strength, and hugie slaughters made, And riuers staind with blood of men that ruddy running fade. And feares long time continuing, and labours hardly rid, Which I myselfe, old man, haue oft with danger great abid. But Turnus dead heere now thou liest where is thy noble pride Of youthly yeeres, thy minde surpassing high? where doth abide The honour of thy countenance, thy persons cumly grace Where is it now become? From Daunus eies what teares down trace, And sorrowes sharpe his hart assalt, shalt, Turnus, thou procure? What streames of teares, what bitter greefe all Ardea to endure? But yet with dastard shameful wound thee slaine he shall not finde. Which will no slender comfort bring vnto his carefull minde, That by Aeneas sword of Troy thy life thou hast vntwinde. This said, the trickling teares on blubred cheekes he downe let fall. And turning to the multitude, the corpes before them all Unto his fathers wofull towne to beare he them did will, Turnus body sent to his father, Where sacred honours due vnto the dead they should fulfill. Anon the body of the youth the Rutils thicke in throng Aduauncing vp did lift, and in a coffin laid along. Then ensignes braue they beare, &amp; spoiles from Troians tane in fight. And headpeices, &amp; steedes, and swordes, and sheildes and armour bright. Anon the charrets warme with Phrygian slaughter next ensue. Then weeping next Metiscus leades his horse, with traueill true That trained was, bedewd with teares, and wet with wofull mone, Which horse before had oft Lord Turnus victour borne, alone When slaughter great in furious moode he made vpon his foes. Then others marching on with turned weapons plodding goes. At last the rout of youthes do weeping follow, large with teares Their breastes distilling wet, &amp; whilst the night foorth wearie weares. Thiswhile Latinus King into the court his steps had bent, When much for funerall so great perplext in minde he went. The matrones all in troupe, the children younge, and fathers graue, Their teares downe trickling shead, the town with shrikes doth yelling raue. But Daunus nothing priuie of such woes yet to remaine, Nor that his noble sun in final fight of combat slaine His haughtie ghost had yeelded vp, and now with sad aray Mischifs linked togither.Drew neere the towne, his hart with other sorowes did affray. For at what time the Latine bandes in fight were put to wurst, And noble Turnus breathing blood imbrued the feild accurst: That time an hugie fire the towne had caught, and walles on hie, And Ardea wofull Daunus cuntrey skorching made to frie, Which all to ashes was consumde, the flame it was so great. There was no meanes nor hope remaining left to saue the seat. I wot nere if the Gods would haue it so, or Destnies wild This token to foreshew that Turnus then in fight was kild. Forthwith the people much appald in minde, and sore affright Their breasts did beat, and mourning sore bewaild this heauy plight. So did the matrones standing all a rew with like desires, Where ech their vtmost did assay to shun the raging fires. And like as when the armie blacke of Antes prest hot at wurke, That vnderneath some tree, or hollow roote wherin to lurke Their dwelling poore haue made, if so by hap therto at length And axe be set, and so the trunke be layd along by strength, On straglingwise anon they startle forth in troupes of striues, And swift to flight themselues betake fast trudging for their liues. And like the Snaile which creeping on an house with fire opprest. When first she feeles the heate, with striuing long doth take no rest, With head and taile she toyles, all meanes of scaping to assay, The heat her skorching, wiles she none lets pas to get away. Noneotherwise, the citizens with dangers like beset Bestur themselues, when present feare their troubled mindes did let. But Daunus old, with yeeres, good man, accloyd, aboue them all To heauen his voice did lift, and to the Gods for helpe did call. Then was there seene anon out of the thickest flame to rise A foule with clapping winges, aloft which mounting cut the skies. The signe and name reteining of the towne, which Ardea hight. So that which late with walles and towres did stand ful steepe in sight, Transfourmed now into a birde with winges doth flie about. Unfortunate southsay. Amazed at this wonder all, and heastes of Gods no doubt Not small astoinde, their burdned backes and mouthes they stil do hold. But Daunus eft his cuntries losse in heauie hart doth fold With raging flames consumed thus, and greifes in minde restraines. On necke of this, a fame forerunning quicke with rumour raignes, Which far and wide their mated mindes inuades with clamour newe, That hard at hand approching comes a wofull corse in viewe With armed troupes accompaned, which Turnus body dead Are bringing home, whose life through fatall wound was lately fled. Astoined all hereat, for with as cuntrey guise had taught, Thick threefold thr?ging fired brands black burning forth they braught The feildes with flames do shine, and to the cummers side by side Themselues they ioyne, whom when thus al in ray the matrones spide Their hands for woe they wring, and to the cloudes they lift their crie. But Daunus when he saw his sunnes dead corpse approching nie, Still standing forth anon did cast with greife his ruthfull looke, And faring frantiklike into the throng himselfe betooke, And on the wofull corse him there he kest, and held it fast, And thus when speech to him began returne, he spake at last. O sun, thy fathers greife, and stay from weeried yeeres bereft, Affection mooued from the vnc?st?cy of worldly thinges. Through dangers great mee drawne (poore wretch alas) where hast thou left? Where did thy valure stout of minde mee lead, but all in vaine In murdrous fight with cruell wound that thus at length art slaine? Is this the honour of thy strength, and glorie of our crowne? Is this our Empires maiestie, and state of great renowne? Such triumphes, sun, doost thou returning bring? is this the rest Which for thy father afflicted oft to win thou didst protest? Of all our sharpe sustained toiles so long, is this the end? Poore man, alas, how hastily fell fortune forth doth bend Our curelesse sliding time, and with what stur do Destnies run? For thou that late to honours high extold didst shine as sun, And greatest in all Latium land wast held, whom Troian bandes So oft in feild did fearfull feele, and flie thy furious handes: Now Turnus here my childe thou liest, a wofull corse in sight. Thy head depriued is of speech, than which for bewtie bright Not all Ausonia had the like, nor yet for speech thy peere Softflowing, nor in peace that could himself more stoutly beere. Where is become thy glistring hue, and countnance cumly cleere, And skin as white as snow, and dulcet eies prouoking cheere? The honour of thine heauely sacred necke where is it fled? With so yll lucke haue these thy firstling toiles of Mars bin led? Was this thy longing sore at parting hence the warres to see, That in this wofull vile aray thou shouldst returne to mee? O hatefull death which doost alone the mindes puft vp in pride With armes reuenging straine, and on our kind both far and wide All ruling beare the sway with equall law, and sparest none, But great and small doo weary hence away till all be gone. The vassals with their princes stout, the valient with the wratch, The old and younge thou makest all alike, and ioynt to match. O death most wretched vile, what cause vnworthy so to rage, Enforced thee my sun to slay with wound, in tender age? Amata Queene thrice happy with thy death thou maist reioyce, That causes to auoide so great of greife, didst take the choyce, And burden hugie great of cares to beare, and chaunces sad. O heauely Gods, what farther greifes like this, or halfe so bad A short recapitulation of his sorowes.For mee poore wretched father do ye prepare? My sun ye haue, And quite to ashes lieth consumde my towne that Ardea braue, And now with wings she beates the aire: yet ouer this, as cheife Then wanting, added is of this thy blooddy death the greife. Of all thy fathers luckles haps this is the fortune last. Of Destnies ill for this the custome is, this is their cast. Looke what poore soule vnto some hard mishap predestned is, On him all mischeifes feirce downe hudling fall, and do not misse. He said, and from his eies the trickling teares ran downe amaine, Deepe sighes from breast he drew, and hard at hart he prest the paine. As when the birde of Ioue, aloft in skies with talantes kine That skimming seekes her pray, when of some fawne with blooddy tine Doth griping straine the tender corps, and off the flesh doth teare, The seely dambe amazed standes opprest with woe and feare. The morning next with shining beames the world had ouerspred, When his Italian power, good king Latinus, hard bested, By fatall foyle and fainting all did see, and conquest wide To lord Aeneas fortune willing so, went on his side. Reuoluing eke the tumultes vile that blooddy warres ensue, Right hugie heapes of carking cares in pensiue minde he drew. When on his promist league he thought, and daughters wedding day: A thousand worthy men of choyce from all the troupes away Aeneas is sent for, to entre Laur?tum. He bids to call, the Troian prince of vertue most renowne Attending safely to conduct vnto Laurentum towne. To these full many Oratours in gownes, with equall charge Instructing much hee ioyneth in this worke with charter large. That since by signes and warninges great of Gods it must be so, That Troian with Italian blood commixed needes do go, They would consent with willing mindes for to perfourme the thinge, And Troian youth with ioyfull harts into the towne to bring. Therwhiles himself the towne in order sets, and rabble rout Appeasing staies their mindes and rest doth promise void of doubt, And sacred peace vnto them all for euer to endure. Then triumphes rightly due with shoutings loud he bids procure, And honours duely to be doone in Court for euery state. And farther willes with cheerfull looke in hope of better fate Forgetting sorowes all, his sun in law they go to meete, And hartily from frendly breastes the Troian youth to greete, And them with shoutings great to enterteine, and welcome make. Instructed thus, vnto the Troian tentes their way they take, Their heades encompast round with sacred crownes of Oliue spray. And to Aeneas courtise lord they come, and peace they pray. Whom hee into his stately court to entre doth desire, And cause of their repaire, with countnance milde, he doth require. Then Drances well ystept in yeeres his graue words thus began. (Who for the death Turnus prince did ioy not smally than.) Most worthy prince, the glory great and hope of auntient Troy, Whose peere for verteous deedes and armes the world doth not enioy, Poore conquerd men for pardon wee thee pray, and sue for grace. And all celestiall Goddesses, and Gods, and this thy face To witnes deepe we call, that king Latinus gainst his will All Latium land in tumultes mad vpstirde, with practice ill, And league broake of vnwilling did behold, nor honour due To Troians did denie to yeeld misled with fancie new. But since the Gods so would, that thou his daughter deere shouldst wed, Thee sun in law he calde, and well did wish thy dulcet hed. The cause of the war is laid vpon Turnus.But whatsoeuer fierce outrage was doone with martiall broiles, Howeuer Furies forst vs to vnrest, and painfull toiles, All that did Turnus bedlem rage, and minde with Feindes opprest Through cancred spite enforce, whose hatefull hart could take no rest. The kingdomes of all Italy gainsaying, with yll moode Assaying armes, he causde to entre feild, which thee withstoode. But all the bandes did him againe request, that leauing war He would thee let enioy thy promist wife, withouten iar. This much did good Latinus king with dubled hands require, Good aged man of valient hart, but hee with raging fire Of war was kindled to to much, ne could our treates preuaile To moue his mind, nor monsters great of gods ought make him quaile. But rather more encenst, wilde fires from flaming iawes did spue, And frantickly himself, and vs, to causelesse warres he drue. Howbeit, for his foule attemptes due recompence he found. For ouerthrowne by thee, he toare with teeth the loathsome ground. Now let his sinfull soule go seeke darke Plutoes seates below, And vnder Acheron for warres, and weddings there to know. Thou better heire far succeede vnto Laurentum land. On thee Latinus familie, and comfort all doth stand. Thee all the Italians wish aboue the golden starres to reigne. Thee great in war, and great thy force in heauenly armes to streine They do extoll, and wish their voice aduance thy worthy fame. The noble troupe of fathers old, and routes right graue of name, An amplificati? of Aeneas prayse.The elder sort of feeble age, and lads of youthful yeeres, The antient dames, and tender babes, &amp; maides not matcht with feeres With one consent most willing thee desire, and do reioyce For Turnus slaine by thy right hand, with loud triumphing voice. The whole land of Ausonia most suppliant to thee Doth make request, whom worthy most of sacred praise to bee They do confesse, and all their eies on thee alone are bent. Latinus king this only due reward for numbers spent Of yeeres, his daughter hath to knit to thee in wedlocke band, Who ofspring great shal yeeld commixt of Troy and Itayle land. Wherfore come of with speede of Troians stout most noble guide, Approch the towne the honours to receiue which we prouide. When he had sayd, with humming voice thesame they mutter all. Whom lord Aeneas first with cheerefull countnance far from gall Doth enterteining comfort thus in wordes not many spent, And on this wise from freendly breast declareth his entent. I neither you, nor good Latinus king, in peace of yore Hee excuseth king Latinus. Accustomed to dwell, do blame at all, but Turnus sore Outragies all this stur, I do not doubt, and bloodie broile Did broach, whose hart to much with youthly loue of praise did boile. But howsoeuer, sirs, it then befell, I not refuse With you to ioyne in wedlocke bandes, but sacred league to chuse Of peace eternally to last, I willingly do knit. My fatherlaw shall wearing still the crowne in quiet sit, And stately scepter hold in hand: My Troians shall for mee A citie build, which by his daughters name shall called bee. And houshould mates I more will ad, and equal lawes ordeine For aie to last, that loue in ech to other may reteine. Therwhiles, that which remaineth yet to do, the bodies ded Commit to fire, whom wofull chance of frantike war misled. And when to morow bright in christall skie shall first appeere, Unto Laurentum towne we wil repaire with ioyfull cheere, He sayd, and with those wordes, their mouthes amazed all they staid, With wondring at this worke of vertue great almost dismaid. Anon, with all their force great mountes of wood they raise in piles. Some vnderlay the bodies dead, some blow the flames therwhiles. Up flieth the smoke, which al the heauen with smutchie steame doth fill Then thousands sheepe from feilde, &amp; swine full fat they bring to kill. And heckfers large they cast into the fires, the flames do cleere The feildes of corpses dead, the aire resounds with shouting cheere. Sir Phœbus now the morning next had brought with golden light, When Troians and Italians commixt, in ioyfull sight All mounted fayre on horseback forth to Laurent take their way, Unto that citie braue well fenst with walles and turrets gay. But Lord Aeneas first before the rest, then Drances old Infourming him of matters many one which there he told. Iülus next his only child, then ripe with elder yeares Alethes, and Ilionee right graue, and next appeares Sir Mnesthee, and Serestus sharpe, and then Sergestus good, And Gyas stout, and strong Cloanthus knight of Troyan blood. Then all the rout of Troians and Italians ensue. Therwhiles aloft the walles full thicke the townesmen throng to vew, And signes of great triumphing ioy and praise they reare on hie, Expecting there the Troian traines approch with greedy eie. Aeneas &amp; king Latinus do meete.And now they came at hand, whom king Latinus glad of cheere Did well attended meete to enterteine them drawing neere. But when in mids of all the troupes he cunning did espie Aeneas prince of Troy (ne did his fancie ghesse a wrie, For why he far exceld the rest in heigth, and portly grace, And bare a Maiestie in looke, and honour in his face.) And when so neere they came, that ech to other speake he might, And heare ech others voyce, and ioyntly hands in freendship smight, Latinus first thus silence breaking, mildly gan recight. Thou comst at length, ne hath my fixed hope my greedy minde Deceiued ought. O most renowmed duke of Dardan kinde. Whom great beheasts of Gods through dangers dread so many threst, Would haue in Italy, and in our houses here to rest. Although the frantike furie foule of man, beyond all right For breach of league hath wrought the wrath of Gods on vs to light. Yea, many times vnwilling mee, when warres I did defie, By craft he trained in, the dangers sharpe of Mars to trie. This so was doone indeede, but deere it cost, for why, in ire The Gods disdaining sent reuenging paines on vs for hire, But now come on most noble Troian lord, since all the spring Of strife is gone, and cause of fact so vile and sinfull thing, The second offer of Lauinia in mariagAccept thy wife, and marriage erst promised of yore. Some realmes I haue, and towne with walles full strong surrounded store. A daughter eke of this my tired age the only stay. And thee my suninlaw for natiue childe I take for aie. To whom then good Aeneas thus replide: Most mighty king, No cause in thee of all these blooddy broiles, such warres to bring I do beleeue, accustoming in peace thy daies to spend. Wherfore such cares at once, good father deere, here let them end. I now am come at last, and thee with ioy whateuer chance For father heere mine I take, and once againe for to aduance Anchises image old in thee I shall begin, and heere Most feruently in sunlike loue to hold, with dutie deere. Thus talked they betweene themselues, and into houses went With princely state bedeckt, where fayne to see with studie bent The Matrones graue, and younger wedded wiues in thickest throng, And fathers old, and youthes more greene of yeres the wayes along There gazing stoode, the Troyan troupes of comly lim to see: But most of all Aeneas mightie prince, of high degree In birth, and cumly farre aboue the rest in princely face, With ioyfull mindes they call, and peace obtainde do glad imbrace, And fruites of rest long wished for do prayse. Like as a rayne, And storme right huge y? long fr? cloudes resolu'de down pourd amayn The husbandmen long time suspenst hath kept, the crooked plowe Hath rusting lyne at rest, when strength of beasts was wont to bowe. But when sir Titan cleare in court right fayre, his horses white Hath loosing set at large, and skies with golden beames are bright, Profusedly they ioy, ech countrey lad another cheares. Th'Ausonians right so, in time so good when ioy appeares, Their mindes asswaged all. And now therwhiles Latinus king, To loftie courtes, and Trauerses of state did stalking, bring Aeneas by his side, and next Iülus bright of hue. Next whom Italians and Troians mixt in course ensue: The court is filde with mirth of troupes that thick th? thither drue. Therwhiles amidst the flockes of matrones graue and younger frie, Lauinia the Uirgin well attended drue her nie. Lauinias cumming and beautye described. Her christall eyes downe casting to the ground, whom there in place When Lord Aeneas saw, so sad of looke, so fresh of face, At first amazed gazing still he stoode, (most strange to heare,) And Turnus wofull chaunce reuoluing deepe him touched neare. That with so great an hope, forst forth to warres, such bloody broyles Had mooued earst, and glad had vndertane such warlike toyles. Then were the Princes both in wedlock band eternall knit, And Hymen songes were sung, with prayses great for Princes fit. Then shoutinges shrill, and muttrings loude of men mount vp to skies Of such as wish them well, whose voice the court through ringing flies. Therwhiles, Aeneas vnto trustie Achates gaue in charge, The giftes which once Andromache him gaue, and presents large With speede to fetch, the garments partie wrought with silke and gold. And which herself was wont, while Troyan state in wealth did hold, To weare about her neck the coller rich beset with stones. And more then these, the mighty drinking boule which Priam ones In signe of loue vnto his father gaue Anchises deare. Achates made no stay, but soone these giftes with ioyfull cheare Returning brought as he commaunded was: Latinus King The costly boule receyueth for reward, an hugie thing. But bright Lauinia his wife, the golden garments gay, And iewell ritche receiuing tooke of gift without delay. And eche doth other enterteyning greete with friendly minde, And sundrie pleasaunt meanes to spend the time in talke they finde. And now the time so late of day departing, asked meate. Description of a princely feast.When loe, the bourdes they lade with princely cates for men to eate. And all the inner roomes with gorgeous furniture they fill. Then all attending there, eche one to set him downe at will On seates with purple spread they do request, on meates to feede, And daynties to be set on bourd to serue hard hungers neede. From christall Ewers water forth they poure mens hands to wash, And set on bourdes good store of Manchet fine well clensde from trash. The wayters then innumerable all, to seruing bent, Themselues to sundrie chargies do deuide with one assent. Some see the tables furnished with meate, some cuppes do tende, And boules to fill w? wine: now here they wag, now there they wende In troupes full thick, and through the pallace great they wander wide. But king Latinus on the lad Iülus all that tide Ententife belde his eyes, his face and gesture marking all, His grauitie in wordes which from his childish mouth did fall. His iudgement ripe so far aboue his yeares: and question much With him he did, and talking too and fro much matter tuch. At length him sweetely kossing, hont in armes embracing long, Reioycing, happie thrice for such reward obtaind among The Gods immortall, Lord Aeneas there he did declare; Whose happe was such a sunne to haue, of wit and vertue rare. When hunger slaked was with meates, the flow forthsliding night With pleasant talke to passe they do begin them to delight. Sometime of Troyan chaunces hard to treat, and Greekish bandes. Sometime of Laurent battailes fiercely fought with bloody handes. Where were the bandes first ouerthrowne, and where they did repell Their enimies, and who the onset first with courage fell Upon the battayle gaue, and mounted fayre on warlike steede His glittring blade did drench with death of foes that fast did bleede. But cheefely Lord Aeneas there, and good Latinus old The antike deedes of noble Latine Lordings did vnfold: And how Saturnus shunning fast the sword of Ioue his sun, The pedegrue of y? Troian Nation. In Italie ariuing hid himselfe, whereof begun The name of Latium vnto that land: and furthermore, How all the people wild, that wont to dwell on hilles before He brought to better life, and gaue them lawes to rule them good, And taught them vse of wine, and how to till their land for foode. And next, how Ioue to this his fathers realme him after drue. Whereas on Atlas daughter, hight Electra, bright of hue, He Dardanus begat, that pierst with wrath his brother slue Iasius by name, and got him soone to Phrigie boundes From Corytus, with nations wundrous store to till the groundes. And how right haute of minde for being sunne to Ioue diuine, An Eagle braue hee bare, the badge of noble Hectors lyne. And was the first that did aduaunce their grandsires worthie fame. And eke the founder first of Troyan blood so great of name. With this, and semblant talke, the time between them long they spent. When mumbling loud men make, whose cheareful charms to laughter bent. The loftie roofes do reach, and all the pallace fill with din. Up rise the Troyans then to daunce, and Latines thick in throng Themselues adioyning come, and Troyan youths permixt among, At sound of harpe they trimly tread their trickes with nimble feete, And swiftly fetch their turnes with comly grace for dauncers meete. And now this wedding feast, vnto the ninth day forth had run, When Lord Aeneas first a citie new with plough begun He layeth out the platform of a citie. To measure put, then houses vp they reare, and trenches wide With bankes they cast on high. When loe, a thing right strange they spide, A thing right strange to tell. A mightie flame brightshining light Lauinias head to touch, and to the cloudes to reach in hight. But Lord Aeneas still astoined stoode, and vp did cast His folded handes to heauen, and praying thus he spake at last. O Iupiter, if euer Troyan wights by sea or lande Thy warninges great haue willingly obayde, ne did withstand. If we thy Godhead euermore with dread, and altars to Haue worshipped, and by what euer else remaynes to do Or is behinde, with happy southsay bring vs quiet rest, Confirme vs sure in this, and end these toyles which we detest. While this he sayd, there stoode him closely by his mother deare, Confessing who she was, and thus she spake with gentle cheare. My sunne, leaue of this care of minde, and take for better blisse These signes of God for future ioy to thee, and not to misse. Now hast thou gotten rest, this is the end of mischiefes all, And wished peace at length by tract of time to thee doth fall. Ne do thou feare the flame that from thy dulcet spouses head To skies doth rise aloft, pluck vp thine heart full farre from dread. For she thy name with famous issue borne shall send to skies, And Troyan captaynes moe bring forth to light that must arise. And valyant Nephues vnto thee shall bring from issue great, That all the world so wide with vertues prayses shall repleat, And with their mightie power full force shall wholy it subdue, He alludeth to the Romains conquest of Britain.And draw the spoyles thereof in Triumphe braue: whom glory true Right great, when they the Ocean haue passed, shall conuay To heauen on high: whom vertues fayne great actes for to assay, And to atchieue, through vertue them as Gods shall lift to skies. As for this flame, thy noble Nations prayse before thyne eyes For future time it showes, by starry fire God gaue this signe. Wherefore, in lue of all this worthie prayse, this citie thine Which heare thou buildest, see that by thy wiues name thou it call. And ouer this, thy sacred houshold Gods from Troyan fall, From fire preserued, place within the walles of thy new towne, And giue them honours large for aie to last with great renowne. For these (a woundrous thing) this towne in loue shall hold so deare, That if remooued thence to other places far they were, Shall of their owne accord returne vnto their former place. Thrice happy man, whom with so good successe the Gods do grace. The Troyan Nation eke thou shalt deteyne in quiet peace. And when at length thy sire in law all aged shall decease, Forewearied with many yeares, and pleasaunt fieldes of rest Among the shadowes shall possesse a place for quiet best, Immediately thou his crowne and scepter large shalt guide, And gouerne the Italians, and ordaine lawes beside. For Troyans and Italians commixt, and glad at last She comforteth him with immortalitie.Thy selfe to heauen shalt send, the Gods decree thus standeth fast. She sayd, and into aire departing thin she went her way. Aeneas then, whom power so great of God did much affray, Astoined sore his Goddesse mothers heaftes doth all fulfill. And now his Troians setled well in peace he rules at will. And king Latinus dying left his scepter, which anon Aeneas him succeeding did possesse when he was gone. And all Italia right large and wide did wholy sway. Now Troians and Italians like customes to obay, And manners did agree rightwillingly with one assent. And feruent loue in freendly breast was fixt not to relent. And equall lawes for both they ioynctly made with good entent. Then Venus glad, in mids of heauen foorthstanding Ioue before, Most humbly there his feete embracing, thus gan him implore. Almighty sire, that althings doost alone from heauen direct, That all affaires and cares of men reuoluing doost detect. While Troians were with luckles fortune drawne, I call to minde Thou promisedst them rest, and end of troubles all to finde. Ne hath thy promise, father deere, at all deceiued mee. For that now all Italia, not iarring once perdee, For three yeeres space in sacred peace hath seene them to remaine. But farthermore than this, thou grauntedst, Ioue, to mee againe My great Aeneas to aduance vnto the loftie skie, And him of due desert to place among the starres on hie. What is thy minde herin as now? For why, euen ripe by this Aeneas vertue longes to dwell aboue in lasting blis. To whom the father of men and Gods, sweet kossing, from an hie These words drewforth fr? breast: How much, good daughter Venus, I Aeneas stout, and Troians all incessantly did loue, Whom perrils eft so great by land and sea forththrust did shoue, Thou knowest wel, and mooued oft, my childe, with loue of thee, I haue bin sorie, greeuing much in minde thy greefe to see. Howbeit yet in tract of time, by Iunoes good consent, I haue them ended all: and now giue care to mine entent, Which is, that I the capteine great of Troians to inuest In heauen haue now decreed, and sure he shall mee seeming best Increase the number of the Gods, and glad I do agree. Thou what in him is mortall take away, and make him free, And ad him to the mighty starres that shine in loftie skies. Yea, others that with vertue fraught herafter shall arise, And eke themselues adorne with praise eterne not to decay, verteous deedes make m? immortal.Fulfilling eke the world with noble deedes of glory gay, Those likewise will I to the skies aduance. All Gods said yee To this, ne did dame Iuno Queene of Gods, once disagree. But gaue aduice that to the heauens Aeneas might ascend, With other kindly wordes, which did to loue and freindship tend. Then Venus through the flittring aire descending downe did slide, And to Laurentum towne she goes, neere where to sea doth glide Numicie riuer drenched deepe in reede, and ouerhid. The body of her sun to wash, and mortall part she bid The water then to clense, and glad the happie soule on hie Late losed from the corpse she bare aloft to dwell in skie, And did amid the starres Aeneas place, whom Iulies line Their priuate God doth call, adorning him with rites deuine.
