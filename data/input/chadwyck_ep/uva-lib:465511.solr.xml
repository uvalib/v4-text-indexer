      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. To the Worthy Patron and Encourager of all Human Projects and Designs, TO-MORROW. REX &amp; PONTIFEX, BEING An Attempt to introduce upon the Stage a new Species of PANTOMIME. PERSONS. Pagan, Jewish, Roman, and Mahometan Priests properly habited. Tyranny, in a coat of mail, a Gothic crown on his head, and chains in his hand. Imposture, a phantom dress'd up by the priests with a cloak, mask, &amp;c. Truth, a beautiful woman drest in white, with great plainness and simplicity. Liberty, drest in her hair, with a flowing robe, a wand, &amp;c. Zeal, has a fool's cap on his head painted with flames, a book in his hand, which he seems to read now and then, casting up his eyes to heaven, and beating his breast with great violence. Persecution has an axe in one hand and a lighted firebrand in the other. Ambition is magnificently drest with stars, ribbons, coronets, and other ensigns of civil honour, eying them often. Corruption has a large bag of money in one hand, and a serpent in the other. Philosophers in Grecian habits. The Arts and the Muses from antiquity. The curtain rises to solemn musick, but something harsh and dissonant, and discovers a magnificent temple; where a cabal of Egyptian Priests, Jewish Rabbins, Mahometan Mufti's, a Pope, a Cardinal, Jesuit, and Capuchin seem in close combination, and are all earnestly employed in dressing up the figure of Imposture. After a while they seem by their whispering, nodding, winking and sneering amongst themselves, to have adjusted matters very much to their own satisfaction. A large cloak is thrown over the shoulders of the figure, to hide its deformities; a mask of a fine compos'd grave air is clapt upon its ugly visage; and several others, curiously delineated for all occasions are cunningly disposed of beneath the cloak: which done, the Priests withdraw. Then enters a band of ancient Philosophers, porperly habited; who, examining the figure of Imposture with great care, seem to debate amongst themselves with calmness and moderation; and at length, having pull'd off its cloak and mask, and discover'd and expos'd its strange features and monstrous deformities, they are just upon the point of demolishing the figure, when the Priests re-enter, leading in Tyranny, with all the ensigns and officers of Civil Power attending him: by the assistance of whom, the Philosophers are driven off the stage, and Imposture is again invested with its cloak and mask. The Priests making obeisance to the Civil Power, seem to beg the continuance of his protection, and the chief of them addresses himself to Tyranny, in the following manner. RECITATIVE. Thou, regal power! vicegerent of the skies! Supreme on earth, and substitute of heav'n! O stretch thy powerful arm, protect and save Its sacred ministers! nor let bold man, With his presumptuous reason, dare to mock Our holy myst'ries, or dispute our rights. AIR. Kings the rights of Priests defending, More securely hold their own; Priests to Kings assistance lending, Merit succour from the throne: Then give us supreme dominion Over conscience and the soul; You shall rule (by our opinion) Lives and goods without controul, Tyranny. RECITATIVE. Most reverend fathers! delegates to men From heaven's high king! ambassadors divine! Be it as you have said. Teach you mankind That power unlimited belongs to Kings, That subjects have no rights but to obey; Then shall the arm of civil power protect Your highest claims of reverence; and enforce Assent to every tenet you shall judge Conducive to establish Priestly rule O'er mind and conscience. AIR. Thus in fetters doubly binding, Souls enslaving, bodies grinding, We the stupid herd shall sway; And, supreme in wealth and grandeur, Silence every bold withstander That shall dare to disobey. Priest. But in this grand affair, this high attempt, To blind, enslave, and fleece a bubbled world; What instruments, what tools shall we employ? Tyranny. Ambition and Corruption be my tools. Priest. Be mine blind Zeal and furious Persecution. Enter to the Priests, at one door, Zeal and Persecution; and to the Civil Power, at the other, Ambition and Corruption, properly distinguish'd. Tyranny. Go forth, ye instruments of our high aims, And in our cause possess the sons of men. Cramp and intimidate th' enquiring mind; With base affections taint the human heart: And tame the generous spirit that breathes in man, And prompts him to resist and brave oppression: So shall that head-strong beast, the multitude, Yield to the bit, and crouch beneath its burthen. Zeal, leading Persecution, goes out one way; and Corruption, leading Ambition, the other. Then enter the Muses and the liberal Arts, with proper habits and ensigns, who seem to beg protection of the Priests and the Civil Power; but being commanded to fall down and worship the figure of Imposture, they refuse; upon which they are immediately chain'd and fetter'd, and cast down bound before it. And now the Civil and Ecclesiastical Powers seem prefectly secure; they shake hands, they embrace, and after a formal solemn dance, in which they alternately bow and reverence each other, they are walking off the stage, when they meet with the Godness of Liberty, who leads in the Philosophers, walks boldly up to the figure of Imposture, and striking it with her wand, speaks as follows. [LIBERTY.] Hence, Delusion, hence, away; Nor in Britain dare to stay: To some foreign land retire, Where dull ign'rance may admire: Here, amongst the brave and free, Truth shall rise, and dwell with me. Then waving her wand, Imposture immediately sinks; and the goddess of Truth, arry'd in robes of white, yet drest with the greatest plainness and simplicity, arises in its room, whom Liberty addresses in the following[LIBERTY.] AIR. Fairest daughter of the skies, Hither turn thy radiant eyes; Thou hast lovers here shall trace, Every charm and every grace: Sons of wisdom, who admire, Sons of freedom, all on fire; Hither, goddess, hither turn; Britons for thy beauties burn. And now the Arts and Muses seem rejoic'd, they rise gradully upon their feet, their chains are taken off by Liberty, who leads up a dance, in which the Philosophers join with the Muses, all of them in the dance making frequent obeisance to the Goddess of Truth. During all this, the powers of Tyranny and Priestcraft are in great dread and confusion. Tyranny threatens with his sword, and the Priest wields a thunder-bolt; but ineffectual and in vain; for at the end of the dance, Truth and Liberty advancing fearless to their opposites, they drop their weapons and submit. After which, Liberty, addressing herself to them, speaks as follows. [LIBERTY.] O why, ye powers, that rule the race man, And you that should instruct him to be wise And good; why will ye join, O why, in league Unnatural, to blind and to enslave! When to reform his morals, and protect His native rights, are your sole provinces, From which perform'd, your safety, glory, all That make kings great, and priests rever'd, arise. AIR. He whose heart with social fire Burns to do what good he can; Sure, by the celestial sire, Will be deem'd the worthiest man: So the patriot warmly prest In his country's sacred cause, Of all subjects is the best, Best deserves his king's applause. Truth. Princes, give ear; give ear, ye reverend seers; And let the words of Truth make deep impression. Man was not made for Kings, but Kings for Man. And that proud tyrant who invades the rights His hand was scepter'd to defend, becomes A sovereign rebel. As that Priest, who for The oracles of heaven gives human creeds, And, wrapt in mysteries, sneering moral worth, Delights to puzzle and confound the mind, Which 'tis his sacred office to enlighten, Falls from heaven's minister to that of hell; And for man's teacher under God, becomes, Under the devil, deputy seducer, AIR. Yet how sacred! how divine! Kings and Priests have power to be! At the throne, or at the shrine, Man might bow, and still be free: Let the Prelate virtue bring, Let the Prince with goodness sway; To the Priest and to the King, All will due obedience pay. CHORUS. Power and goodness, when they join, Make Kings sacred, Priests divine. THE ART of PREACHING: In Imitation of HORACE's Art of Poetry. Should some strange poet, in his piece, affect Pope's nervous stile, with Cibber's jokes bedeck'd; Prink Milton's true sublime with Cowley's wit; And garnish Blackmore's Job with Swift's conceit; Would you not laugh? Trust me, that Priest's as bad, Who in a stile now grave, now raving mad, Gives the wild whims of dreaming schoolmen vent, Whilst drowsy congregations nod assent. Painters and priests, 'tis true, great licence claim, And by bold strokes have often rose to fame: But whales in woods, or elephants in air, Serve only to make fools and children stare; And in religion's name if priests dispense Flat contradictions to all common sense; Tho' gaping bigots wonder and believe, The wise 'tis not so easy to deceive. Some take a text sublime, and fraught with sense, But quickly fall into impertinence. On trifles eloquent, with great delight They flourish out on some strange mystick rite; Clear up the darkness of some useless text, Or make some crabbed passage more perplext: But to subdue the passions, or direct, And all life's moral duties, they neglect. Most preachers err (except the wiser few) Thinking establish'd doctrines, therfore true: Others, too fond of novelty and schemes, Amuse the world with airy idle dreams: Thus too much faith, or too presuming wit, Are rocks where bigots, or free-thinkers spilt. The very meanest dabler at Whitehall Can rail at papists, or poor quakers maul; But when of some great truth he aims to preach, Alas, he finds it far beyond his reach. Young deacons try your strength, and strive to find A subject suited to your turn of mind; Method and words are easily your own, Or should they fail youâsteal from Tillotson. Much of its beauty, usefulness, and force, Depends on rightly timing a discourse. Before the l?ds or c?mm?nsâfar from nice, Say boldlyâBrib'ry is a dirty viceâ But quickly check yourselfâand with a sneerâ Of which this honourable house is clear. Great is the work, and worthy of the gown, To bring forth hidden truths, and make them known. Yet in all new opinions, have a care, Truth is too strong for some weak minds to bear: And are new doctrines taught, or old reviv'd? Let them from scripture plainly be deriv'd. Barclay or Baxter, wherefore do we blame For innovations, yet approve the same In Wickliffe and in Luther? Why are these Call'd wise reformers, those mad sectaries? 'Tis most unjust: Men always had a right, And ever will, to think, to speak, to write Their various minds; yet sacred ought to be The publick peace, as private liberty. Opinions are like leaves, which every year Now flourish green, now fall and disappear. Once the pope's bulls could terrify his foes, And kneeling princes kiss'd his sacred toes, Now he may damn, or course, or what he will, There's not a prince in Christendom will kneel, Reason now reigns, and by her aid we hope Truth may revive, and sickening error droop: She the sole jude, the rule, the gracious light Kind heaven has lent to guide our minds aright. States to embroil, and faction to display, In wild harrangues, Sacheverel show'd the way. The fun'ral sermon, when it first began, Was us'd to weep the loss of some good man; Now any wretch, for one small piece of gold, Shall have fine praises from the pulpit sold: But whence this custom rose, who can decide? From priestly av'rice? or from human pride? Truth, moral virtue, piety, and peace, Are noble subjects, and the pulpit grace: But zeal for trifles arm'd imperious Laud, His power and cruelty the nation aw'd. Why was he honour'd with the name of priest, And greatest made, unworthy to be least, Whose zeal was fury, whose devotion pride, Power his great god, and interest his sole guide? To touch the passions, let your stile be plain; The praise of virtue asks a higher strain: Yet sometimes the pathetick may receive The utmost force that eloquence can give; As sometimes, in elogiums, 'tis the art, With plain simplicity to win the heart. 'Tis not enough that what you say is true, To make us feel it, you must feel it too: Show your self warm'd, and that will warmth impart To every hearer's sympathizing heart. Does generous Foster virtue's laws enforce? All give attention to the warm discourse: But who a cold, dull, lifeless, drawling keeps, One half his audience laughs, the other sleeps. In censuring vice, be earnest and severe; In stating dubious points, concise and clear; Anger requires stern looks and threat'ning stile; But paint the charms of virtue with a smile. These different changes common sense will teach, And we expect them from you if you preach; For should your manner differ from your theme, Or in quite different subjects be the same, Despis'd and laugh'd at, you may travel down, And hide such talents in some country town. It much concerns a preacher first to learn The genius of his audience, and their turn. Amongst the citizens be grave and slow; Before the nobles let fine periods flow; The Temple church asks Sherlock's sense and skill; Beyond the Tow'râno matterâwhat you will. In facts or notions drawn from sacred writ, Be orthodox, nor cavil to show wit: Let Adam lose a rib to gain a wife, Let Noah's ark contain all things with life, Let Moses work strange wonders with his rod, And let the sun stand still at Joshua's nod, Let Solomon be wise, and Samson strong, Give Saul a witch, and Balaam's ass a tongue. But if your daring genius is so bold To teach now doctrines, or to censure old, With care proceed; you tread a dangerous path; Error establish'd, grows establish'd faith. 'Tis easier much, and much the safer rule To teach in pulpit what you learnt at school; With zeal defend what'er the church believes, If you expect to thrive, or wear lawn sleeves, Some loudly bluster, and consign to hell All who dare doubt one word or syllable Of what they call the faith; and which extends To whims and trifles without use or ends: Sure 'tis much nobler, and more like divine, T' enlarge the path to heaven, than to confine: Insist alone on useful points, or plain; And know, God cannot hate a virtuous man. If you expect or hope that we should stay Your whole discourse, nor strive to slink away; Some common faults there are you must avoid, To every age and circumstance ally'd. A pert young student just from college brought, With many little pedantries is fraught: Reasons with syllogism, persuades with wit, Quotes scraps of Greek instead of sacred writ; Or deep immers'd in politick debate, Reforms the church, and guides the tottering state. These trifles with maturer age forgot, Now some good benefice employs his thought; He seeks a patron, and will soon incline To all his notions civil or divine; Studies his principles both night and day, And as that scripture guides, must preach and pray. Av'rice and age creep on: his reverend mind Begins to grow right-reverendly inclin'd. Power and preferment still so sweetly call, The voice of heaven is never heard at all: Set but a tempting bishoprick in view, He's strictly orthodox and loyal too; With equal zeal defends the church and state, And infidels and rebles share his hate. Some things are plain, we can't misunderstand; Some still obscure, tho' thousands have explain'd: Those influence more which reason can conceive, Than such as we thro' faith alone believe; In those we judge, in these you may deceive: But what too deep in mystery is thrown, The wisest preachers chuse to let alone. How Adam's fault affects all human kind; How three is one, and one is three combin'd; How certain prescience checks not future will; And why almighty goodness suffers ill; Such points as these lie far too deep for man, Were never well explain'd, nor ever can. If pastors more than thrice five minutes preach, Their sleepy flocks begin to yawn and stretch. Never presume the name of God to bring As sacred sanction to a trifling thing. Before, or after sermon, hymns of praise Exalt the soul, and true devotion raise. In songs of wonder celebrate his name, Who spread the skies, and built the starry frame: Or thence descending view this globe below, And praise the source of every bliss we know. In ancient times, when heaven was to be prais'd, Our humble ancestors their voices rasi'd, And hymns of thanks from grateful bosoms flow'd, For ills prevented, or for good bestow'd: But as the church increas'd in power and pride, The pomp of sound the want of sense supply'd; Majestick organs then were taught to blow, And plain religion grew a raree-show: Strange ceremonious whims, a numerous race, Were introduc'd, in truth's and virtue's place. Mysterious turnpikes block up heaven's highway, And for a ticket, we our reason pay. These superstitions quickly introduce Contempt, neglect, wild satire, and abuse; Religion and its priests, by every fool Where thought a jest, and turn'd to ridicule. Some few indeed found where the medium lay, And kept the Martin in the Tale of a Tub. coat, but tore the fringe away. Of preaching well if you expect the fame, Let truth and virtue be your first great aim. Your sacred function often call to mind, And think how great the trust, to teach mankind! 'Tis yours in useful sermons to explain, Both what we owe to God, and what to man. 'Tis yours the charms of liberty to paint, His country's love in every breast to plant; Yours every social virtue to improve, Justice, forbearance, charity, and love; Yours too the private virtues to augment, Of prudence, temperance, modesty, content: When such the man, how amiable the priest; Of all mankind the worthiest, and the best. Ticklish the point, I grant, and hard to find, To please the various tempers of mankind. Some love you should the crabbed points explain, Where texts with texts a dreadful war maintain: Some love a new, and some the beaten path, Morals please some, and others points of faith; But he's the man, he's the admir'd divine, In whose discourses truth and virtue join: These are the sermons which will ever live, By these our Tonsons and our Knaptons thrive; How such are read, and prais'd, and how thy sell. Let Barrow's, Clarke's, and Butler's sermons tell. Preachers should either make us good or wise, Him that does neither, who but must despise? If all your rules are useful, short, and plain, We soon shall learn them, and shall long retain? But if on trifles you harangue, away We turn our heads, and laugh at all you say. But priests are men, and men are prone to err, On common failings none should be severe; All are not masters of the same good sense, Nor blest with equal powers of eloquence. 'Tis true: and errors with an honest mind, Will meet with easy pardon from mankind; But who persists in wrong with stubborn pride, Him all must censure, many will deride. Yet few are judges of a fine discourse, Can see its beauties, or can feel its force; With equal pleasure some attentive sit, To sober reasoning, and to shallow wit. What then? Because your audience most are fools, Will you neglect all method, and all rules? Or since the pulpit is a scared place, Where none dare contradict you to your face, Will you presume to tell a thousand lyes? If so, we may forgive, but must despise. In jingling Bev'ridge if I chance to see One word of sense, I prize the rarity: But if in Hooker, Sprat, or Tillotson, A thought unworthy of themselves is shown, I grieve to see it, but 'tis no surprize, The greatest men are not at all times wise. Sermons, like plays, some please us at the ear, But never will a serious reading bear; Some in the closet edify enough, That from the pulpit seem'd but sorry stuff. 'Tis thus: there are, who by ill preaching spoil Young's pointed sense, or Atterbury's stile; Whilst others by the force of eloquence, Make that seem fine, which scarce is common sense. In every science, they that hope to rise, Set great examples still before their eyes. Young lawyers copy Murray where they can; Physicians Mead, and surgeons Cheselden; But all will preach, without the least pretence To virtue, learning, art, or eloquence. Why not? you cry: they plainly see, no doubt, A priest may grow right-reverend without. Preachers and preaching were at first design'd For common benefit to all mankind. Publick and private virtues they explain'd, To goodness courted, and from vice restrain'd: Love, peace, and union breath'd in each discourse, And their examples gave their precepts force. From these good men, the priests and all their line Were honour'd with the title of divine. But soon their proud successors left this path, Forsook plain morals for dark points of faith; Till creeds on creeds the warring world inflam'd, And all mankind, by different priests, were damn'd. Some ask which is th' essential of a priest, Virtue or learning? what they ask's a jest: We daily see dull loads of reverend fat, Without pretence to either this or that, But who'd like Herring or like Hoadly shine, Must with great learning real virtue join. He who by preaching hopes to raise a name, To no small excellence directs his aim. On every noted preacher he must wait; The voice, the look, the action imitate: And when compleat in stile, and eloquence, Must then crown all with learning and good sense. But some with lazy pride disgrace the gown, And never preach one sermon of their own; 'Tis easier to transcribe than to compose, So all the week they eat, and drink, and doze. As quacks with lying puffs the papers fill, Or hand their own praise in a pocky bill, Where empty boasts of much superior sense, Draw from the cheated croud their idle pence; So the great H?nley hires for half a crown, A quack advertisement to tell the town Of some strange point to be disputed on: Where all who love the science of debate, May hear themselves, or other coxcombs prate. When dukes or noble lords a chaplain hire, They first of his capacities enquire. If stoutly qualify'd to drink and smoke, If not too nice to bear an impious joke, If tame enough to be the common jest, This is a chaplain to his lordship's taste. If bards to Pope indifferent verses show, He is too honest not to tell them so. This is obscure, he cries, and this too rough, These trifling, or superfluous; strike them off. How useful every word from such a friend! But parsons are to proud, their works to mend, And every fault with arrogance defend: Think them too sacred to be criticiz'd, And rather chuse to let them be despis'd. He that is wife will not presume to laugh At priests, or church-affairs; it is not safe. Think there exists, and let it check your sport, That dreadful monster call'd a spiritual court. Into whose cruel jaws if once you fall, In vain, alas! in vain for aid you call; Clerks, proctors, priests, voracious round you ply, Like leeches sticking, till they've suck'd you dry. AN EPISTLE TO Mr. POPE, Occasion'd by his ESSAY on MAN. Great bard! in whom united we admire, The sage's wisdom, and the poet's fire: In whom at once, the great and good commend The fine companion, and the useful friend:â 'Twas thus the muse her eager flight began, Ardent to sing the poet and the man: But truth in verse is clad too like a lie, And you, at least, would think it flattery; Hating the thought, I check my forward strain, I change my stile, and thus begin again. As when some student first with curious eye, Thro' nature's wond'rous frame attempts to pry; His doubtful reason seeming faults surprise, He asks if this be just? if that be wise? Storms, tempests, earthquakes, virtue in distress, And vice unpunish'd, with strange thoughts oppress: Till thinking on, unclouded by degrees, His mind is open'd, fair is all he sees; Storms, tempests, earthquakes, virtue's ragged plight, And vice's triumph, all are just and right: Beauty is found, and order, and design, And the whole scheme acknowledg'd all divine. So when at first I view'd thy wond'rous plan, Leading thro' all the winding maze of man; Bewilder'd, weak, unable to pursue, My pride would fain have laid the fault on You. This false, that ill-exprest, this thought not good, And all was wrong which I misunderstood. But reading more attentive, soon I found, The diction nervous, and the doctrine sound. Saw man, a part of that stupendous whole, âWhose body nature is, and God the soul.â Saw in the scale of things his midle state, And all his powers adapted just to that. Saw reason, passion, weakness, how of use, How all to good, to happiness conduce. Saw my own weakness, thy superior power, And still the more I read, admire the more. This smile drawn out, I now began To think of forming some design or plan, To aid my muse, and guide her wand'ring lay, When sudden to my mind came honest Gay, For form or method I no more contend, But strive to copy that ingenious friend: In his first Epistle. Like him to catch my thoughts just as they roseâ And thus I caught them, laughing at thy foes. Where are ye nowâye criticks, shall I say? Or owls, who sicken at this God of day? What! mighty scriblers, will you let him go Uncensur'd, unabus'd, unhonour'd so? Step forth, some great distinguish'd daring dunce, Write but one page, you silence him at once: Write without fear; you will, you must succeed; He cannot answerâfor he will not read. Here paus'd the museâalas! the jade is bit, She fain would copy Gay, but wants his wit. She paus'd, indeedâbroke off as he had done, Wrote four unmeaning lines, and then went on. Ye wits and fools; ye libertines and saints, Come pour upon the foe your joint complaints. First, you who oft, with wisdom too refin'd, Can censure and direct th' Eternal Mind, Ingenious wits, who modestly pretend This bungling frame, the universe, to mend; How can you bear; in your great reason's spight, To hear him prove, âWhatever is, is right? Alas! how easy to confute the song! If all is right, how came your heads so wrong? And come, ye solemn fools, a numerous band, Who read, and read, but never understand, Pronounce it nonsenseâCan't you prove it too? Good faith, my friends, it may be soâto You. Come too, ye libertines, who lust for power, Or wealth, or fame, or greatness, or a whore; All who true sensual happiness adhere to, And laugh him out of this old-fashion'd virtue: Virtue, where he has whimsically plac'd Your only blissâHow odd is some men's taste! And come, ye rigid saints, with looks demure, Who boast yourselves right holy, just, and pure; Come, and with pious zeal the lines decry, Which give your proud hypocrisy the lie: Which own the best have failings, not a few; And prove the worst, sometimes, as good as You. What! shall he taint such perfect souls with ill? Shall sots not place their bliss in what they will? Nor fools be fools? Nor wits sublime descend In charity to heaven its works to mend? Laughs he at these?â'Tis monstrous. To be plain, I'd have ye writeâHe can but laugh again. Here lifting up my head, surpriz'd, I see Close at my elbow, flattering Vanity. From her soft whispers soon I found it came, That I suppos'd myself not one of them. Alas! how easily ourselves we sooth! I fear, in justice, he must laugh at both. For Vanity abash'd, up to my ear Steps honest Truth, and these sharp words I hear; âForbear, vain bard, like them forbear thy lays; âAlike to POPE such censure and such praise. âNor that can sink, nor this exalt his name, âWho owes to virtue, and himself, his fame. ON Good and Ill-Nature. To Mr. Pope. In virtue's cause to draw a daring pen, Defend the good, encounter wicked men: Freely to praise the virtues of the few, And boldly censure the degenerate crew. To scorn, with equal justice, to deride The poor man's worth, or sooth the great one's pride; All this was once good-nature thought, not ill; Nay, some there are so odd to think so still. Old-fashion'd souls! your men of modern taste, Are with new virtue, new politeness grac'd. Good-nature now has chang'd her honest face, For smiling flattery, compliment, grimace: Fool grins at fool, each coxcomb owns his brother, And thieves and sharpers compliment each other. To such extent good-nature now is spread, To be sincere is monstrously ill-bred: An equal brow to all is now the vogue, And complaisance goes round from rogue to rogue. If this be goodâ'tis gloriously true, The most ill-natur'd man alive, is YOU. THE Cave of POPE. A Prophesy. When dark oblivion, in her sable cloak Shall wrap the names of heroes and of kings; And their high deeds, submitting to the stroke Of time, shall fall amongst forgotten things: Then (for the muse that distant day can see) On Thames's bank the stranger shall arrive, With curious wish thy sacred grott to see, Thy sacred grott shall with thy name survive. Grateful posterity, from age to age, With pious hand the ruin shall repair: Some good old man, to each enquiring sage Pointing the place, shall cry, The bard liv'd there, Whose song was music to the listening ear, Yet taught audacious vice and folly, shame; Easy his manners, but his life severe; His word alone gave infamy or fame. Sequester'd from the fool, and coxcomb-wit, Beneath this silent roof the muse he found; 'Twas here he slept inspir'd, or sate and writ, Here with his friends the social glass went round. With awful veneration shall they trace The steps which thou so long before hast trod; With reverend wonder view the solemn place, From whence thy genius soar'd to nature's God. Then, some small gem, or moss, or shining oar, Departing, each shall pilfer, in fond hope To please their friends, on every distant shore, Boasting a relick from the Cave of Pope. ON THE DEATH of Mr. POPE. Come, ye whose souls harmonious sounds inspire, Friends to the muse, and judges of her song; Who catching from the bard his heavenly fire; Soar as he soars, sublimely rapt along; Mourn, mourn your loss: he's gone who had the art, With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart. Who now shall dare to lift the sacred rod, Truth's faithful guard, where vice escapes the law? Who now, high-soaring to the throne of God, In nature's moral cause his pen shall draw? Let none pretend; he's gone, who had the art, With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart. Vice now, secure, her blushless front shall raise, And all her triumph be thro' Britain borne; Whose worthless sons from guilt shall purchase praise, Nor dread the hand that pointed them to scorn; No check remains; he's gone, who had the art, With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart. Ye tuneless bards, now tire each venal quill, And from the publick gather idle pence; Ye tasteless peers, now build and plant your fill, Tho' splendor borrows not one ray from sense: Fear no rebuke; he's gone, who had the art, With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart. But, come, ye chosen, ye selected few, Ye next in genius, as in friendship, join'd, The social virtues of his heart who knew, And stated all the beauties of his mind; Drop, drop a tear; he's gone, who had the art, With sounds to charm the ear, with sense to warm the heart. And, O great shade! permit thy humblest friend His sigh to waft, his greateful tear to pay Thy honour'd memory; and condescend To hear, well-pleas'd, the weak yet well-meant lay, Lamenting thus; he's gone, who had the art, With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart. MODERN REASONING. An EPISTLE. Whence comes it, L?, that ev'ry fool, In reason's spite, in spite of ridicule, Fondly his own wild whims for truth maintains, And all the blind deluded world disdains; Himself the only person blest with sight, And his opinion the great rule of right? 'Tis strange from folly this conceit should rise, That want of sense should make us think we're wise: Yet so it is. The most egregious elf Thinks none so wise or witty as himself. Who nothing knows, will all things comprehend; And who can least confute, will most contend. I love the man, I love him from my soul, Whom neither weakness blinds, nor whims controul; With learning blest, with solid reason fraught, Who slowly thinks, and ponders every thought: Yet conscious to himself how apt to err, Suggests his notions with a modest fear; Hears every reason, every passion hides, Debates with calmness, and with care decides; More pleas'd to learn, than eager to confute, Not victory, but truth his sole pursuit. But these are very rare. How happy he Who tastes such converse, L?, with thee! Each social hour is spent in joys sublime, Whilst hand in hand o'er learning's Alps you climb; Thro' reason's paths in search of truth proceed, And clear the flow'ry way from every weed; Till from her antient cavern rais'd to light, The beauteous stranger stands reveal'd to sight. How far from this the furious noisy crew, Who, what they once assert, with zeal pursue? Their greater right infer from louder tongues; And strength of argument from strength of lungs, Instead of sense, who stun your ears with sound, And think they conquer, when they but confound. Taurus, a bellowing champion, storms and swears, And drives his argument thro' both your ears; And whether truth or falshood, right or wrong, 'Tis still maintain'd, and prov'd by dint ofâtongue. In all disputes he bravely wins the day, No wonderâfor he hears not what you say. But tho' to tire the ear's sufficient curse, To tire one's patience is a plague still worse. Plato, a formal sage, debates with care, A strong opponent, take him up who dare. His words are grave, deliberate, and cool, He looks so wiseâ'tis pity he's a fool. If he asserts, tho' what no man can doubt, He'll bring ten thousand proofs to make it out. This, this, and thisâis so, and so, and so; And therefore, therefore,âthat, and that, you know, Circles no angles have; a square has four: A square's no circle thereforeâto be sure. The sum of Prato's wond'rous wisdom is, This is not that, and therefore, that not this. Oppos'd to him, but much the greater dunce, Is he who throws all knowledge off at once. The first, for every trifle will contend; But this has no opinions to defend. In fire no heat, no sweetness in the rose; The man's impos'd on by his very nose; Nor light nor colour charms his doubting eye, The world's a dream, and all his senses lie. He thinks, yet doubts if he's possess'd of thought; Nay, even doubts his very power to doubt. Ask him if he's a man, or beast, or bird? He cannot tell, upon his honest word, 'Tis strange, so plain a point's so hard to prove; I'll tell you what you areâa fool, by Jove. Another class of disputants there are, More num'rous than the doubting tribe by far. These are your wanderers, who from the point Run wild in loose harangues, all out of joint. Vagarious, and confute him if you can, Will hold debate with any mortal man. He roves from Genesis to Revelations, And quite confounds you with divine quotations. Should you affirm that Adam knew his wife, And by that knowledge lost the tree of life; He contradicts you, and in half an hour Most plainly provesâPope Joan the scarlet whore. Nor head nor tail his argument affords, A jumbling, incoherent mass of words; Most of them true, but so together tost Without connection, that their sense is lost. But leaving these to rove, and those to doubt, Another clan alarms us; face about: See, arm'd with grave authority they come, And with great names and numbers strike us dumb. With these an error ven'rable appears, For having been believ'd three thousand years. Reason, nay common sense, to names must fall, And strength of argument's no strength at all. But on, my muse, tho' multitudes oppose us, Alas! truth is not prov'd by counting noses: Nor fear, tho' ancient sages are subjoin'd; A lie's a lie, tho' told by all mankind. 'Tis true, I love the ancientsâbut what then? Plato and Aristotle were but men. I grant 'em wiseâthe wisest disagree, And therefore no sufficient guides for me. An error, tho' by half the world espous'd, Is still an error, and may be oppos'd; And truth, tho' much from mortal eyes conceal'd, Is still the truth, and may be more reveal'd. How foolish then will look your mighty wise, Should half their ipse dixits prove plain lies! But on, my muse, another tribe demands Thy censure yet: nor shou'd they 'scape thy hands. These are the passionate; who in dispute, Demand submission, monarchs absolute. Sole judges, in their own conceit, of wit, They damn all those for fools that won't submit. Sir Testy (thwart sir Testy if you dare) Swears there's inhabitants in every star. If you presume to say this mayn't be true, You lie, sir, you're a fool and blockhead too. What he asserts, if any disbelieve, How folks can be so dull he can't conceive. He knows he's right; he knows his judgment's clear; But men are so perverse they will not hear. With him, Swift treads a dull trite beaten way; In Young no wit, no humour smiles in Gay; Nor truth, nor virtue, Pope, adorns thy page; And Thompson's Liberty corrupts the age. This to deny, if any dare presume, Fool, coxcomb, sot, and puppy fill the room. Hillario, who full well this humour knows, Resolv'd one day his folly to expose, Kindly invites him with some friends to dine, And entertains e'm with a roast sir-loin: Of this he knew sir Testy could not eat, And purposely prepar'd it for his treat. The rest beginâsir Testy, pray fall toâ You love roast beef sir, comeâI know you do. âExcuse me, sir, 'tis what I never eat.â How, sir! not love roast beef! the king of meat! â'Tis true indeed.â Indeed it is not true; I love it, sir, and you must love it too. âI can't upon my wordâ, Then you're a fool, And don't know what's good eating, by my soul. Not love roast beef!âcome, come, sirs, fill his plate, I'll make him love itâSir, G?d?ye, eat. Sir Testy finding what it was they meant, Rose in a passion, and away he went. RELIGION. A Simile. I'm often drawn to make a stop, And gaze upon a picture shop. There have I seen (as who that tarries Has not the same?) a head that varies; And as in diff'rent views expos'd, A diff'rent figure is disclos'd. This way a fool's head is express'd, Whose very count'nance is a jest; Such as were formerly at court, Kept to make wiser people sport. Turn it another way, you'll have A face ridiculously grave, Something betwixt the fool and knave. Again, but alter the position, You're frighted with the apparition: A hideous threatening Gorgon head Appears, enough to fright the dead. But place it in its proper light, A lovely face accosts the sight; Our eyes are charm'd with every feature, We own the whole a beauteous creature. Thus true Religion fares. For when By silly, or designing men, In false or foolish lights 'tis plac'd, 'Tis made a bugbear, or a jest. Here by a set of men 'tis thought A scheme, by politicians wrought, To strengthen and enforce the law, And keep the vulgar more in awe: And these, to shew sublimer parts, Cast all religion from their hearts; Brand all its vot'ries as the tools Of priests, and politician's fools. Some view it in another light, Less wicked, but as foolish quite: And these are such as blindly place it In superstitions that disgrace it; And think the essence of it lies In ceremonious fooleries: In points of faith and speculation, Which tend to nothing but vexation. With these it is a heinous crime To cough or spit in sermon-time: 'Tis worse to whistle on a Sunday, Than cheat their neighbours on a Monday: To dine without first saying grace, is Enough to lose in heaven their places; But goodness, honesty and virtue, Are what they've not the least regard to. Others there are, and not a few, Who place it in the bugbear view! Think it consists in strange severities: In fastings, weepings, and austerities. False notions their weak minds possess, Of faith, and grace, and holiness: And as the Lord's of purer eyes Than to behold iniquities; They think, unless they're pure and spotless, All their endeavours will be bootless; And dreadful furies in Ã¦ternum, In unconsuming fires will burn 'em. But, O how happy are the few, Who place it in its proper view! To these it shines divinely bright, No clouds obscure its native light; Truth stamps conviction in the mind, All doubts and fears are left behind, And peace and joy at once an enterance find. PAIN and PATIENCE. An ODE I To scourge the riot and intemperate lust, Or check the self-sufficient pride of man, Offended heaven sent forth, in vengeance just, The dire inexorable fury, Pain; Beneath whose griping hand, when she assails, The firmest spirits sink, the strongest reasoning fails. II Near to the confines of th' infernal den, Deep in a hollow cave's profound recess, Her courts she holds; and to the sons of men Sends out the ministers of dire distress: Repentance, shame, despair, each acts her part; Whets the vindictive steel, and aggravates the smart. III He whose luxurious palate daily rang'd Earth, air, and ocean, to supply his board; And to high-relish'd poisons madly chang'd The wholesome gifts of nature's bounteous lord; Shall find sick nauseous surfeit taint his blood; And his abus'd pall'd stomach loath the daintiest food. IV The midnight reveller's intempreate bowl, To rage and riot fires his furious brain; Remorse ensues, and agony of soul, His future life condemn'd to ceaseless pain: Gout, fever, stone, to madness heighten grief; And temperance, call'd too late, affords him no relief; V He whose hot blood excites to dangerous joy, And headlong drives to seek the lewd embrace, Startled at length, shall in his face descry The mark indelible of foul disgrace: Ulcers obscene corrode his akeing bones; And his high raptures change to deep-felt sighs and groans. VI The wild extravagant, whose thoughtless hand, With lavish tasteless pride, commits expence; Ruin'd, perceives his waining age demand Sad reparation for his youth's offence: Upbraiding riot points to follies past, Presenting hollow want, fit successor to waste. VII He too, whose high presuming health defies Th' almighty hand of heaven to pull him down; Who slights the care and caution of the wise, Nor fears hot summer's rage, nor winter's frown: Some trifling ail shall seize this mighty man; Blast all his boasted strength, rack every nerve with pain. VIII Thus nature's God inflicts, by nature's law, On every crime its proper punishment; Creating Pain to keep mankind in awe, And moral ills by physical prevent: In wrath still gracious; claiming still our praise, Ev'n in those very groans our chastisements shall raise IX But lest the feeble heart of suffering man Too low should sink beneath the keen distress; Lest fell despair, in league with cruel pain, Should drive him desperate in their wild excess; Kind Hope her daughter Patience sent from high, To ease the labouring breast, and wipe the trickling eye. X Hail, mild divinity! calm Patience, hail! Soft-handed, meek-ey'd maid, yet whose firm breath, And strong perswasive eloquence prevail Against the rage of pain, the fear of death: Come, lenient beauty, spread thy healing wing, And smooth my restless couch, whilst I thy praises sing. XI In all this toilesome round of weary life, Where dulness teazes, or pert noise assails; Where trifling follies end in serious strife, And money purchases where merit fails; What honest spirit would not rise in rage, If patience lent not aid his passion to asswage? XII No state of life but must to Patience bow: The tradesman must have patience for his bill; He must have Patience who to law will go, And should he lose his right, more Patience still. Yea, to prevent or heal full many a strife, How oft, how long must man have Patience with his wife? XIII But heav'n grant Patience to the wretched wight, Whom pills, and draughts, and bolusses assail! Which he must swallow down with all his might; Ev'n then when health, and strength, and spirits fail. Dear doctors, find some gentler ways to kill; Lighten this load of drugs, contract yon length of bill. XIV When the dull, prating, loud, long-winded dame, Her tedious, vague, unmeaning tale repeats; Perplex'd and wand'ring round and round her theme, Till lost and puzzled, she all theme forgets; Yet still talks on with unabating speed; Good gods! who hears her out, must Patience have indeed. XV So when some grave, deep-learned, sound divine Ascends the pulpit, and unfolds his text: Dark and more dark grows what he would define, And every sentence more and more perplext; Yet still he blunders on the same blind course, Teaching his weary'd hearers Patience upon force. XVI Without firm Patience who could ever bear The great man's levee, watching for a smile? Then, with a whisper'd promise in his ear, Wait its accomplishment a long, long while; Yet thro' the bounds of Patience if he burst, Daniel's long weeks of years may be accomplish'd first. XVII O Patience! guardian of the temper'd breast, Against the insolence of pride and power; Against the wit's keen sneer, the fool's dull jest; Against the boaster's lye, told o're and o're; To thee this tributary lay I bring, By whose firm aid impower'd, in raging Pain I sing. Kitty. A Pastoral. I Beneath a cool shade, by the side of a stream, Thus breath'd a fond shepherd,, his Kitty his theme: Thy beauties comparing, my dearest, said he, There's nothing in Nature so lovely as thee. II Tho' distance divides us, I view thy dear face, And wander in transport o'er every grace; Now, now I behold thee, sweet-smiling and pretty, O gods! you've made nothing so fair as my Kitty! III Come, lovely idea, come fill my fond arms, And whilst in soft rapture I gaze on thy charms, The beautiful objects which round me arise, Shall yield to those beauties that live in thine eyes. IV Now Flora the meads and the groves does adorn. With flowers and blossoms on every thorn; But look on my Kitty!âthere sweetly does blow, A spring of more beauties than Flora can show. V See, see how that rose there adorns the gay bush, And proud of its colour, wou'd vie with her blush. Vain boaster! thy beauties shall quickly decay, She blushesâand see how it withers away. VI Observe that fair lily, the pride of the vale, In whitness unrivall'd, now droop and look pale; It sickens, and changes its beautiful hue, And bows down its head in submission to you. VII The zephyrs that fan me beneath the cool shade, When panting with heat on the ground I am laid, Are less greatful and sweet than the heavenly air That breaths from her lips when she whispersâmy dear. VIII I hear the gay lark, as she mounts in the skies, How sweet are her notes! how delightful her voice! Go dwell in the air, little warbler, go! I have musick enough while my Kitty's below. IX With pleasure I watch the industrious bee, Extracting her sweets from each flower and tree: Ah fools! thus to labour to keep you a live; Fly, fly to her lips, and at once fill your hive. X See there, on the top of that oak, how the doves Sit brooding each other, and cooing their loves: Our loves are thus tender, thus mutual our joy, When folded on each other's bosom we lie. XI It glads me to see how the pretty young lambs Are fondled, and cherish'd, and lov'd by their dams: The lambs are less pretty, my dearest, then thee; Their dams are less fond, nor so tender as me. XII As I gaze on the river that smoothly glides by, Thus even and sweet is her temper, I cry; Thus clear is her mind, thus calm and serene, And virtues, like gems, at the bottom are seen. XIII Here various flowers still paint the gay scene, And as some fade and die, others bud and look green; The charms of my Kitty are constant as they; Her virtues will bloom as her beauties decay. XIV But in vain I compare her, here's nothing so bright, And drakness approaches to hinder my sight: To bed I will hasten, and there all her charms, In softer ideas, I'll bring to my arms. COLIN's KISSES. Song I. The Tutor. Come, my fairest, learn of me, Learn to give and take the bliss; Come, my love, here's none but we, I'll instruct thee how to kiss. Why turn from me that dear face? Why that blush, and down-cast eye? Come, come, meet my fond embrace, And the mutual rapture try. Throw thy lovely twining arms Round my neck, or round my waist; And whilst I devour thy charms, Let me closely be embrac'd: Then when soft ideas rise, And the gay desires grow strong; Let them sparkle in thy eyes, Let them murmur from thy tongue. To my breast with rapture cling, Look with transport on my face, Kiss me, press me, every thing To endear the fond embrace. Every tender name of love, In soft whispers let me hear; And let speaking nature prove Every extasy sincere. Song II. The Imaginary Kiss. When Fanny I saw as she tript o'er the green, Fair, blooming, soft, artless and kind; Fond love in her eyes, wit and sense in her mien, And warmness with modesty join'd: Transported with sudden amazement I stood, Fast riveted down to the place; Her delicate shape, easy motion I view'd, And wander'd o'er every grace. Ye gods! what luxuriance of beauty, I cry, What raptures must dwell in her arms! On her lips I could feast, on her breast I could die, O Fanny, how sweet are thy charms! Whilst thus in idea my passion I fed, Soft transport my senses invade, Young Damon step'd up, with the substance he fled, And left me to kiss the dear shade. Song III. The Feast. Polly, when your lips you join, Lovely ruby lips, to mine; To the bee the flow'ry field Such a banquet does not yield; Not the dewy morning-rose So much sweetness does inclose; Not the gods such nectar sip, As Colin from thy balmy lip: Kiss me then, with rapture kiss, We'll surpass the gods in bliss. Song IV. The Stolen Kiss. On a mossy bank reclin'd, Beauteous Chloe lay reposing, O'er her breast each am'rous wind Wanton play'd, its sweets disclosing: Tempted with the swelling charms, Colin, happy swain, drew nigh her, Softly stole into her arms, Laid his scrip and sheep-hook by her. O'er her downy panting breast His delighted fingers roving; To her lips his lips he prest, In the extasy of loving: Chloe, waken'd with his kiss, Pleas'd, yet frowning to conceal it, Cry'd, true lovers share the bliss? Why then, Colin, wou'd you steal it? Song V. The Meeting Kiss. Let me fly into thy arms; Let me taste again thy charms; Kiss me, press me to thy breast In raptures not to be exprest. Let me clasp thy lovely waist; Throw thy arms around my neck: Thus embracing and embrac'd, Nothing shall our raptures check. Hearts with mutual pleasure glowing; Lips with lips together growing; Eyes with tears of gladness flowing; Eyes, and lips, and hearts shall show, Th' excess of joy that meeting lovers know. Song VI. The Parting Kiss. One kind kiss before we part, Drop a tear, and bid adieu; Tho' we sever, my fond heart Till we meet shall pant for you. Yet, yet weep not so, my love, Let me kiss that falling tear, Tho' my body must remove, All my soul will still be here. All my soul, and all my heart, And every wish shall pant for you; One kind kiss then e'er we part, Drop a tear, and bid adieu. Song VII. The Borrow'd Kiss. See I languish, see I faint, I must borrow, beg, or steal; Can you see a soul in want, And no kind compassion feel? Give, or lend, or let me take One sweet kiss, I ask no more; One sweet kiss, for pity's sake, I'll repay it o'er and o'er. Chole heard, and with a smile, Kind, compassionate and sweet, Colin, it's a sin to steal, And for me to give's not meet: But I'll lend a kiss, or twain, To poor Colin in distress; Not that I'd be paid again, Colin I mean nothing less. Song VIII. The Kiss Repaid. Chloe, by that borrow'd kiss, I, alas! am quite undone; 'Twas so sweet, so fraught with bliss, Thousands will not pay that one. Lest the debt should break your heart, Roguish Chloe smiling cries, Come, a hundred then in part, For the present shall suffice. Song IX. The Secret Kiss. At the silent evening hour, Two fond lovers in a bower Sought their mutal bliss; Tho' her heart was just relenting, Tho' her eyes seem'd just consenting, Yet she fear'd to kiss. Since this secret shade, he cry'd, Will those rosy blushes hide, Why will you resist? When no tell-tale spy is near us, Eye not sees, nor ear can hear us, Who wou'd not be kiss'd? Molly hearing what he said, Blushing lifted up her head, Her breast soft wishes fill; Since, she cry'd, no spy is near us, Eye not sees, nor ear can hear us, Kissâor what you will. Song X. The Rapture. Whilst on thy dear bosom lying, CÃ¦lia, who can speak my bliss? Who the raptures I'm enjoying, When thy balmy lips I kiss? Every look with love inspiers me, Every touch my bosom warms, Every melting murmur fires me, Every joy is in thy arms. Those dear eyes, how soft they languish! Feel my heart with rapture beat! Pleasure turns almost to anguish, When the transport is so sweet. Look not so divinely on me, CÃ¦lia, I shall die with bliss; Yet, yet turn those eyes upon me, Who'd not die a death like this? Song XI. The Reconciling Kiss. Why that sadness on thy brow? Why that starting crystal tear? Dearest Polly, let me know, For thy grief I cannot bear. Polly with a sigh reply'd, What need I the cause impart? Did you not this moment chide? And you know it breaks my heart. Colin, melting as she spoke, Caught the fair one in his arms; O my dear! that tender look, Every passion quite disarms: By this dear relenting kiss, I'd no anger in my thought; Come, my love, by this, and this, Let our quarrel be forgot. As when sudden stormy rain, Every drooping flowret spoils; When the sun shines out again, All the face of nature smiles: Polly, so reviv'd and cheer'd By her Colin's kind embrace, Her declining head up-rear'd, Sweetly smiling in his face. Song XII. The Mutual Kiss. CÃ¦lia, by those smiling graces, Which my panting bosom warm; By the heaven of thy embraces, By thy wond'rous power to charm; By those soft bewitching glances, Which my inmost bosom move; By those lips, whose kiss entrances, Thee, and thee alone I love. By thy God-like art of loving, CÃ¦lia, with a blush, replies; By thy heavenly power of moving, All my soul to sympathize; By thy eager fond caresses, By those arms around me thrown; By that look, which truth expresses, My fond heart is all thy own. Thus, with glowing inclination, They indulge the tender bliss; And to bind the lasting passion, Seal it with a mutual kiss: Close, in fond embraces, lying, They together seem to grow; Such supreme delight enjoying, As true lovers only know. THE WIFE. A FRAGMENT. The virtues that endear and sweeten life, And form that soft campanion, call'd a Wife; Demand my song. Thou who dist first inspire The tender theme, to thee I tune the lyre. Hail, lovely woman! nature's blessing, hail! Whose charms o'er all the powers of man prevail: Thou healing balm of life, which bounteous heaven, To pour on all our woes, has kindly given! What were mankind without thee? or what joy, Like thy soft converse, can his hours employ? The dry, dull, drowsy bachelor surveys, Alternative, joyless nights and lonesome days: No tender transports wake his sullen breast, No soft endearments lull his cares to rest: Stupidly free from nature's tenderest ties, Lost in his own sad self he lives and dies. Not so the man, to whom indulgent heaven That tender bosom-friend, a wife, has given: Him, blest in her kind arms, no fears dismay, No secret checks of guilt his joys allay: No husband wrong'd, no virgin honour spoil'd, No anxious parent weeps his ruin'd child! No fell disease, no false embrace is here, The joys are safe, the raptures are sincere. Does fortune smile? How grateful must it prove To tread life's pleasing round with one we love! Or does she frown? The fair, with softening art, Will sooth our woes, or bear a willing part. âBut are all women of the soothing kind? âIn chusing wives no hazard shall we find? âWill spleen, nor vapours, pride, nor prate molest? âAnd is all fear of cuckoldom a jest? Grant some are bad: yet surely some remain, Good without show, and lovely without stain; Warm without lewdness; virtuous without pride; Content to follow, yet with sense to guide. Such is Fidelia, fairest, fondest wife; Observe the picture, for I draw from life. Near that fam'd hill, from whose enchanting brow Such various scenes enrich the vales below; While gentle Thames, meandering glides along, Meads, flocks, and groves, and rising towers among, Fidelia dwelt: fair as the fairest scene Of smiling nature, when the sky's serene. Full sixteen summers had adorn'd her face, Warm'd every sense, and waken'd every grace; Her eye look'd sweetness, gently heav'd her breast, Her shape, her motion, graceful ease exprest. And to this fair, this finish'd form, were join'd The softest passions, and the purest mind. Prose passages have been omitted. CÃ¦tera desunt. ROME's PARDON: A TALE. If Rome can pardon sins, as Romans hold; And if those pardons may be bought and sold, If were no sin t' adore and worship gold, Rochester. It happen'd on a certain time, Two Seigniors, who had spent the prime Of youth in every wickedness, Came to his holiness to confess; Of which, the one had riches store, The other (wicked wretch!) was poor. But both grown old, had now a mind To die in peace with all mankind; And go to heaven a nearer way Than those who all their life-time pray: Which may effected be they hope, By buying pardon of the pope. So calling fresh to mind their sins, The rich offender thus begins. âMost holy father, I have been, âI must confess, in many a sin. âAll laws divine I've thought a joke; âAll human laws for interest broke. âAnd to encrease my ill-got store, âThought it no crime t'oppress the poor, âTo cheat the rich, betray my friends, âOr any thing to gain my ends. âBut now grown old, and near to die, âI do repent me heartily âOf all my vile offences past, âAnd in particular the last, âBy which I wickedly beguil'd âA dead friend's son, my guardian child, âOf all his dear paternal store, âWhich was ten thousand pounds or more; âWho since is starv'd to death by want, âAnd now sincerely I repent: âWhich that your holiness may see, âOne half the sum I've brought with me, âAnd thus I cast it at your feet, âDispose of it as you think meet, âTo pious uses, or your own, âI hope 'twill all my faults atone. âFriend, quoth the pope, I'm glad to see âSuch true repentance wrought in thee; âBut as your sins are very great, âYou have but half repented yet: âNor can your pardon be obtain'd, âUnless the whole which thus you've gain'd, âTo pious uses be ordain'd. âAll! cry'd the man, I thought that half âHad been a pretty price enough. âNay, quoth the pope, sir, if you hum âAnd haw at parting with the sum, âGo, keep it, do; and damn your soul: âI tell you, I must have the whole. â'Tis not a little thing procures âA pardon for such sins as yours. Wellârather than be doom'd to go, To dwell with everlasting woe, One wou'd give any thing, you know: So th' other half was thrown down to't, And then he soon obtain'd his suit; A pardon for his sins was given, And home he went assur'd of heaven. And now the poor man bends his knee; âMost holy father, pardon me, âA poor and humble penitent âWho all my substance vilely spent, âIn every wanton' youthful pleasure; âBut now I suffer out of measure; âWith dire diseases being fraught âAnd eke so poor not worth a groat. âPoor! quoth the pope, then cease your suit, âIndeed you may as well be mute; âForbear your now too late contrition, âYou're in a reprobate condition. âWhat! spend your wealth, and from the whole âNot save one souse to save your soul? âO, you're a sinner, and a hard one, âI wonder you can ask a pardon: âFriend, they're not had, unless you buy 'em, âYou're therefore damn'd, as sure I amâ âVice-gerent to the king of heaven: âNo, no, such sins can't be forgiven. âI cannot save you if I wou'd, âNor would I do it if I cou'd. Home goes the man in deep despair, And dy'd soon after he came there; And went, 'tis said, to hell: But sure He was not damn'd for being poor! But long he had not been below, Before he saw his friend come too; At this he was in great surprize, And scarcely could believe his eyes: âWhat, friend, said he, are you come too? âI thought the pope had pardon'd you. âYes, quoth the man, I thought so too; âBut I was by the pope trapan'dâ âThe devil could not read his hand. AN EPISTLE TO STEPHEN DUCK, AT His First Coming to Court. Forgive me, Duck, that such a muse as mine, Brings her weak aid to the support of thine; In lines, which if the world should chance to see, They'd find I pleaded for myselfâin thee. Yet some indulgence sure they ought to shew An infant poet, and unlearn'd as you; Unskill'd in art, unexercis'd to sing; I've just but tasted the Pierian spring: But tho' my stock of learning yet is low; Tho' yet my numbers don't harmonious flow, I fain wou'd hope it won't be always so. The morning sun emits a stronger ray, Still as he rises tow'rds meridian day: Large hills at first obstruct the oblique beam, And dark'ning shadows shoot along the gleam; Impending mists yet hover in the air, And distant objects undistinct appear. But as he rises in the eastern sky, The shadows shrink, the conquer'd vapours fly; Objects their proper forms and colours gain; In all her various beauties shines th' enlighten'd plain. So when the dawn of thought peeps out in man, Mountains of ign'rance shade at first his brain? A gleam of reason by degrees appears, Which brightens and encreases with his years; And as the rays of thought gain strength in youth, Dark mists of error melt and brighten into truth. Thus asking ign'rance will to knowledge grow; Conceited fools alone continue so. On then, my friend, nor doubt but that in time Our tender muses, learning now to climb, May reach perfection's top, and grow sublime. The Iliad scarce was Homer's first essay; Virgil wrote not his Ãneid in a day: Nor is't impossible a time might be, When Pope and Prior wrote like You and Me. 'Tis true, more learning might their works adorn, They wrote not from a pantry nor a barn: Yet they, as well as we, by slow degrees Must reach perfection, and to write with ease. Have you not seen? yes, oft you must have seen, When vernal suns adorn the woods with green, And genial warmth, enkindling wanton love, Fills with a various progeny the grove, The tim'rous young, just ventur'd from the nest, First in low bushes hop, and often rest; From twig to twig, their tender wings they try, Yet only flutter when they seem to fly. But as their strength and feathers more increase, Short flights they take, and fly with greater ease: Experienc'd soon, they boldly venture higher, Forsake the hedge, to lofty trees aspire; Transported thence, with strong and steady wing They mount the skies, and soar aloft, and sing. So you and I, just naked from the shell, In chirping notes our future singing tell; Unfeather'd yet, in judgment, thought, or skill, Hop round the basis of Parnassus' hill: Our flights are low, and want of art and strength. Forbids to carry us to the wish'd-for length. But fledg'd, and cherish'd with a kindly spring, We'll mount the summit, and melodious sing. AN EPITAPH. Here lie the remains of Caroline, Queen consort of Great Britain. Whose virtues Her Friends, when living, knew and enjoy'd; Now dead, her foes confess and admire. Her ambition aspired to Wisdom, And attain'd it; To knowledge, And it fill'd her mind. Patroness of the Wife. And a friend of the Good, She look'd, and modest Merit rais'd its head; She smil'd, and weeping Woe grew glad. Religion, plain and simple, Dignify'd her mind, Despising forms and useless pageantry. Morals, clear and refin'd, Dwelt in her heart, And guided all her actions. Virtue she lov'd, beneath her smile it flourish'd; She frown'd on Vice, and it was put to shame. In fine, Her Life was a publick blessing; Her Death is an universal loss. O reader! if thou doubtest of these things, Ask the cries of the Fatherless, they shall tell thee, And the tears of the Widow shall confirm their truth: The sons of Wisdom shall testify of her, And the daughters of Virtue bear her witness; The voice of the Nation shall applaud her, And the heart of the King shall sigh her praise. NO RICHES. Humbly Inscrib'd To the Right Hon??? ? To succour all whom grief or cares oppress, To raise neglected merit from distress, The dying arts t' encourage and revive, And independent of mankind to live; This, this is Riches' grand prerogative. These all the wise and good with joy pursue, And thousands feel, and bless their power in you. But stay, my muse, nor rashly urge thy theme, Examine well thy candidates for fame; Thy verse is praise. Considerâvery few Can justly say one single line's their due: Scorn thou with generous freedom to record, Without his just credentitals, duke or lord: An honest line prefer to a polite, So shall thy praise no conscious blush excite. But as to paint a lovely female face, With every charm adorn'd, and every grace, Requires a finer hand, and greater care, Than the rough features of a H?r; So praise than satire asks a nicer touch; But finisht well, there's nothing charms so much. A shining character when drawn with art, Like beauty, whilst it pleases, wins the heart, MecÃ¦nas first the noble list shall grace, Learning's great patron merits the first place. O dear to every muse! to every art! Virtue's chief friend! supporter of desert! Is there a man, tho' poor, despis'd, opprest, Yet whose superior genius shines confest; Whether the useful arts his soul inspire, Or the politer muse's sacred fire, Learning and arts t'encourage and extend? In thee he finds a patron and a friend. Wealth thus bestow'd returns in lasting fame, A grateful tribute to the donor's name. Next him from whom true virtue meets reward, Is he who shows to want a kind regard. Carus, tho' blest with plenty, ease, and health, His every want supply'd from boundless wealth, Yet feels humanity: his soul o'erflows To see, or hear, or think on others woes. Is there a wretch with pinching want opprest? His pain, till eas'd, is felt in Carus' breast. Does any languish under dire disease? Carus prescribes, or pays the doctor's fees. Has sad misfortune fatal ruin thrown, And some expiring family undone? Carus repairs, and makes the loss his own. To hear the widow's or the orphan's cries, His soul in pity melts into his eyes: O manly tenderness! good-natur'd grief. To feel, to sympathize, and give relief. Sure gods are Carus' debtors. Gold thus given, Lies out at interest in the bank of heaven. But where's th' advantage then, will Corvus say, If wealth is only lent to give away? Corvus, were that the sole prerogative, How great, how godlike is the power to give! Thou canst not feel it: True, 'tis too divine For such a selfish narrow soul as thine. Comes is rich, belov'd by all mankind, To chearful hospitality inclin'd; His ponds with fish, with fowl his woods are stor'd, Inviting plenty smiles upon his board: Easy and free, his friends his fortune share, Ev'n travelling strangers find a welcome there; Neighbours, domesticks, all enjoy their parts, He in return possesses all their hearts. Who, foolish Corvus, who but thee will say, That Comes idly throws his wealth away? Is then the noble privilege to give, The sole advantage we from wealth receive! Whilst others wants or merits we supply, Have we ourselves no title to enjoy? Doubtless you have. A thousand different ways Wealth may be self-enjoy'd, and all with praise. Whom truth and reason guides, or genius fires, Never need fear indulging his desires. But shou'd pretending coxcombs, from this rule, Plead equal privilege to play the fool; The muse forbids. She only gives to sense The dangerous province to contrive expence. Marcus in sumptuous buildings takes delight, His house, his gardens charm the ravish'd sight: With beauty use, with grandeur neatness joins, And order with magnificence combines. 'Tis costly: True, but who can blame th' expence, âWhere splendor borrows all her rays from sense? Sylvio retirement loves; smooth crystal floods, Green meadows, hills and dales, and verdant woods Delight his eye; the warbling birds to hear, With rapture fills his soul, and charms his ear. In shady walks, in groves, in secret bowers, Plan'd by himself, he spends the peaceful hours: Here serious thought pursues her thread serene, No interrupting follies intervene; Propitious silence aids th' attentive mind, The God of nature in his works to find. If this t' enjoy affords him most delight, Who says that Sylvio is not in the right? Publius in curious paintings wealth consumes, The best, the finest hands adorn his rooms; Various designs, from each enliven'd wall, Meet the pleas'd eyes, and something charms in all. Here well-drawn landskips to the mind convey A smiling country, or a stormy sea; Towns, houses, trees, diversify the plain, And ships in danger fright us from the main. There the past actions of illustrious men, In strong description charm the world agen: Love, anger, grief, in different scenes are wrought, All its just passions animate the draught. But see new charms break in a flood of day, See Loves and Graces on the canvas play; Beauty's imagin'd smiles our bosom warm, And light and shade retains the power to charm. Who censures Publius, or condemns his cost, Must wish the noble art of painting lost. Whilst Publius thus his taste in painting shews, Critus admires her sister art, the muse. Homer and Virgil, Horace and Boileau Teach in his breast poetick warmth to glow. From these instructed, and from these inspir'd. Critus for taste and judgment is admir'd. Poets before him lay the work of years, And from his sentence draw their hopes and fears. Hail, judge impartial! noble critick, hail! In this thy day, good writing must prevail: Our bards from you will hence be what they shou'd, Please and improve us, make us wise and good. Thus bless'd with wealth, his genius each pursues, In building, planting, painting, or the muse. O envy'd power!âBut you'll object and say, How few employ it in this envy'd way? With all his heaps did Chremes e'er do good? No: But they give him power, if once he wou'd: 'Tis not in riches to create the will, Misers, in spite of wealth, are misers still, Is it for gold the lawless villian spoils? 'Tis for the same the honest lab'rer toils. Does wealth to sloth, to luxury pervert? Wealth too excites to industry, to art: Many, no doubt, thro' power of wealth oppress, But some, whom heaven reward, delight to bless! Then blame not gold, that men are proud or vain, Slothful or covetous; but blame the man. When right affections rule a generous heart, Gold may refine, but seldom will pervert. THE PETITION. The various suppliants which address Their pray'rs to heaven on bended knees, All hope alike for happiness, Yet each petition disagrees. Fancy, not judgment, constitutes their bliss; The wise, no doubt, will say the same of this. Ye Gods, if you remember right, Some eighteen years ago, A form was made divinely bright, And sent for us t' admire below: I first distinguish'd her from all the rest, And hope you'll therefore think my title best. I ask not heaps of shining gold, No, if the Gods vouchsafe My longing arms may her infold, I'm rich, I'm rich enough! Riches at best can hardly give content; But having her, what is there I can want? I ask not, with a pompous train Of honours, all th' world t' outbrave; The title I wou'd wish to gain, Is,âHer most fav'rite slave: To bow to her, a greater bliss wou'd be Than kings and princes bowing down to me. To rule the world with power supreme, Let meaner souls aspire; To gain the sov'reignty from them I stoop not to desire: Give me to reign sole monarch in her breast, Let petty princes for the world contest. Let libertines, who take delight In riot and excess, Thus waste the day, thus spend the night, Whilst I to joys sublimer press: Clasp'd in her snowy arms such bliss I'd prove, As never yet was found, or felt in love. In short, I ask you not to live A tedious length of days; Old age can little pleasure give, When health and strength decays: Let but what time I have be spent with her's, Each moment will be worth a thousand years. AN EPITHALAMIUM. Hence, hence all dull cares, All quarrels and jarrs, Ye factious disturbers of pleasure, avoid! Content, love, and joy, Shall their powers employ, To bless the glad bridegroom and beautiful bride. Anger shall ne'er presume To come within this room; No doubt nor anxious fear, Nor jealous thought shall enter here. Ill-nature, ill-manners, contention, and pride, Shall never, shall never the union divide. O the pleasing, pleasing raptures, Read in Hymen's nuptial chapters! Love commencing, Joys dispensing; Beauty smiling, Wit beguiling; Kindness charming, Fancy warming; Kissing, toying, Melting, dying; O the pleasing, pleasing raptures! THE ADVICE. Dost thou, my friend, desire to rise To honour, wealth, and dignities? Virtue's paths, though trod by few, With constant steps do thou pursue. For as the coward-soul admires That courage which the brave inspires; And his own quarrels to defend, Gladly makes such a one his friend; So in a world which rogues infest, How is an honest man caress'd! The villians from each other fly, And on his virtue safe rely. A Lamentable CASE. Submitted to the Bath Physicians. Ye fam'd physicians of this place, Hear Strephon's and poor Chole's case. Nor think that I am joking; When she wou'd, he cannot comply, When he wou'd drink, she's not a-dry; And is not this provoking? At night, when Strephon comes to rest, Chloe receives him on her breast, With fondly-folding arms: Down, down he hangs his drooping head, Falls fast asleep, and lies as dead, Neglecting all her charms. Reviving when the morn returns, With rising flames young Strephon burns, And fain, wou'd fain be doing: But Chloe now, asleep or sick, Has no great relish for the trick, And sadly baulks his wooing. O cruel and disast'rous case, When in the critical embrace That only one is burning! Dear docters, set this matter right, Give Strephon spirits over night, Or Chloe in the morning. A Lady's SALUTATION to her Garden in the Country. Welcome, fair scene; welcome, thou lov'd retreat, From the vain hurry of the bustling great. Here let me walk, or in this fragrant bower, Wrap'd in calm thought improve each fleeting hour. My soul, while nature's beauties feast mine eyes, To nature's God contemplative shall rise. What are ye now, ye glittering, vain delights, Which waste our days, and rob us of our nights? What your allurements? what your fancy'd joys? Dress, equipage, and show, and pomp, and noise. Alas! how tasteless these, how low, how mean, To the calm pleasures of this rural scene? Come then, ye shades, beneath your bending arms Enclose the fond admirer of your charms; Come then, ye bowers, receive your joyful guest, Glad to retire, and in retirement blest; Come, ye fair flowers, and open ev'ry sweet; Come, little birds, your warbling songs repeat, And O descend to sweeten all the rest, Soft smiling peace, in white-rob'd virtue drest; Content unenvious, ease with freedom join'd, And contemplation calm, with truth refin'd: Deign but in this fair scene with me to dwell, All noise and nonsense, pomp and show farewell. And see! O see! the heav'n-born train appear! Fix then, my heart; thy happiness is here. The Progress of LOVE. A SONG. Beneath the myrtle's secret shade, When Delia blest my eyes; At first I view'd the lovely maid In silent soft surprise. With trembling voice, and anxious mind, I softly whisper'd love; She blush'd a smile so sweetly kind, Did all my fears remove. Her lovely yielding form I prest, Sweet maddening kisses stole; And soon her swimming eyes confest The wishes of her soul: In wild tumultuous bliss, I cry, O Delia, now be kind! She press'd me close, and with a sigh, To melting joys resign'd. SONG. [Man's a poor deluded bubble] Man's a poor deluded bubble, Wand'ring in a mist of lies, Seeing false, or seeing double, Who wou'd trust to such weak eyes? Yet presuming on his senses, On he goes most wond'rous wise: Doubts of truth, believes pretences; Lost in error, lives and dies. An Epigram, occasion'd by the Word one Prior, in the Second Volume of Bishop Burnet's History. One Prior!âand is this, this all the fame The poet from th' historian can claim! No; Prior's verse posterity shall quote, When 'tis forgot one Burnet ever wrote. An Epigram. [Cries Sylvia to a reverend dean] Cries Sylvia to a reverend dean, What reason can be given, Since marriage is a holy thing, That there are none in heaven? There are no Women, he reply'd; She quick returns the jestâ Women there are, but I'm afraid They cannot find a Priest. The Kings of Europe. A JEST. Why pray, of late, do Europe's kings No jester in their courts admit? They're grown such stately solemn things. To bear a joke they think not fit. But tho' each court a jester lacks, To laugh at monarchs to their face; All mankind behind their backs Supply the honest jester's place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. MELPOMENE: OR, The Regions of TERROR and PITY. AN ODE. I Queen of the human heart! at whose command The swelling tides of mighty Passion rise; Melpomene, support my vent'rous hand, And aid thy suppliant in his bold emprise; From the gay scenes of pride Do thou his footsteps guide To Nature's aweful courts, where nurst of yore, Young Shakespear, Fancy's child, was taught his various lore. II So may his favour'd eye explore the source, To few reveal'd, whence human sorrows charm: So may his numbers, with pathetic force, Bid Terror shake us, or Compassion warm, As different strains controul The movements of the soul; Adjust its passions, harmonize its tone; To feel for others' woe, or nobly bear its own. III Deep in the covert of a shadowy grove, 'Mid broken rocks where dashing currents play; Dear to the pensive Pleasures, dear to Love, And Damon's Muse, that breathes her melting lay, This ardent prayer was made: When lo! the secret shade, As conscious of some heavenly presence, shookâ Strength, firmness, reason, allâmy' astonish'd soul forsook. IV Ah! whither Goddess! whither am I borne? To what wild region's necromantic shore? These pannics whence? and why my bosom torn With sudden terrors never felt before? Darkness inwraps me round, While from the vast profound Emerging spectres dreadful shapes assume, And gleaming on my sight, add horror to the gloom. V Ha! what is He whose fierce indignant eye, Denouncing vengeance, kindles into flame? Whose boisterous fury blows a storm so high, As with its thunder shakes his labouring frame. What can such rage provoke? His words their passage choak: His eager steps nor time nor truce allow, And dreadful dangers wait the menace of his brow. VI Protect me, Goddess! whence that fearful shriek Of consternation? as grim Death had laid His icy fingers on some guilty cheek, And all the powers of manhood shrunk dismay'd: Ah see! besmear'd with gore Revenge stands threatening o'er A pale delinquent, whose retorted eyes In vain for pity callâthe wretched victim dies. VII Not long the spaceâabandon'd to despair, With eyes aghast, or hopeless fix'd on earth, This slave of passion rends his scatter'd hair, Beats his sad breast, and execrates his birth: While torn within he feels The pangs of whips and wheels; And sees, or fancies, all the fiends below, Beckoning his frighted soul to realms of endless woe. VIII Before my wondering sense new phantoms dance, And stamp their horrid shapes upon my brainâ A wretch with jealous brow, and eyes askance, Feeds all in secret on his bosom pain. Fond love, fierce hate assail; Alternate they prevail: While conscious pride and shame with rage conspire, And urge the latent spark to flames of torturing fire. IX The storm proceedsâhis changeful visage trace: From Rage to Madness every feature breaks. A growing phrenzy grins upon his face, And in his frightful stare Distraction speaks: His straw-invested head Proclaims all reason fled; And not a tear bedews those vacant eyesâ But songs and shouts succeed, and laughter-mingled sighs X Yet, yet again!âa Murderer's hand appears Grasping a pointed dagger stain'd with blood! His look malignant chills with boding fears, That check the current of life's ebbing flood. In midnight's darkest clouds The dreary miscreant shrowds His felon stepâas 'twere to darkness given To dim the watchful eye of all-pervading Heaven. XI And hark! ah Mercy! whence that hollow sound? Why with strange horror starts my bristling hair? Earth opens wide, and from unhallow'd ground A pallid Ghost slow-rising steals on air. To where a mangled corse Expos'd without remorse Lies shroudless, unentomb'd, he points the awayâ Points to the prowling wolf exultant o'er his prey. XII âWas it for this, he cries, with kindly shower âOf daily gifts the traitor I caress'd? âFor this, array'd him in the robe of power, âAnd lodg'd my royal secrets in his breast? âO kindness ill repay'd! âTo bare the murdering blade âAgainst my life!âmay Heav'n his guilt explore, âAnd to my suffering race their splendid rights restore.â XIII He said, and stalk'd away.âAh Goddess! cease Thus with terrific forms to rack my brain; These horrid phantoms shake the throne of peace, And Reason calls her boasted powers in vain: Then change thy magic wand, Thy dreadful troops disband, And gentler shapes, and softer scenes disclose, To melt the feeling heart, yet soothe its tenderest woes. XIV The fervent prayer was heard.âWith hideous sound, Her ebon gates of darkness open flew; A dawning twilight chears the dread profound; The train of Terror vanishes from view. More mild enchantments rise; New scenes salute my eyes, Groves, fountains, bowers, and temples grace the plain, And turtles cooe around, and nightingales complain. XV And every myrtle bower and cypress grove, And every solemn temple teems with life; Here glows the scene with fond but hapless love, There, with the deeper woes of human strife. In groups around the lawn, By fresh disasters drawn, The sad spectators seem transfix'd in woe; And pitying sighs are heard, and heart-felt sorrows flow. XVI Behold that beauteous maid! her languid head Bends like a drooping lily charg'd with rain: With floods of tears she bathes a Lover dead, In brave assertion of her honour slain. Her bosom heaves with sighs; To Heaven she lifts her eyes, With grief beyond the power of words opprest, Sinks on the lifeless corse, and dies upon his breast. XVII How strong the bands of Friendship? yet, alas! Behind yon mouldering tower with ivy crown'd, Of two, the foremost in her sacred class, One, from his friend, receives the fatal wound! What could such fury move! Ah what, but ill-star'd love? The same fair object each fond heart enthralls, And he, the favour'd youth, her hapless victim falls. XVIII Can ought so deeply sway the generous mind To mutual truth, as female trust in love? Then what relief shall yon fair mourner find, Scorn'd by the man who should her plaints remove? By fair, but false pretence, She lost her innocence; And that sweet babe, the fruit of treacherous art, Claspt in her arms expires, and breaks the parent's heart. XIX Ah! who to pomp or grandeur would aspire? Kings are not rais'd above Misfortune's frown: That form so graceful even in mean attire, Sway'd once a scepter, once sustain'd a crown. From Filial rage and strife, To screen his closing life, He quits his throne, a father's sorrow feels, And in the lap of Want his patient head conceals. XX More yet remain'dâbut lo! the pensive Queen Appears confest before my dazzled sight; Grace in her steps, and softness in her mien, The face of sorrow mingled with delight. Not such her nobler frame, When kindling into flame, And bold in Virtue's cause, her zeal aspires To waken guilty pangs, or breathe heroic fires. XXI Aw'd into silence, my rapt soul attendsâ The Power, with eyes complacent, saw my fear; And, as with grace ineffable she bends, These accents vibrate on my listening ear. âAspiring son of art, âKnow, tho' thy feeling heart âGlow with these wonders to thy fancy shown, âStill may the Delian God thy powerless toils disown. XXII âA thousand tender scenes of soft distress âMay swell thy breast with sympathetic woes; âA thousand such dread forms on fancy press, âAs from my dreary realms of darkness rose; âWhence Shakespear's chilling fears, âWhence Otway's melting tearsâ âThat aweful gloom, this melancholy plain, âThe types of every theme that suits the tragic strain. XXIII âBut dost thou worship Nature night and morn, âAnd all due honour to her precepts pay? âCanst thou the lure of Affectation scorn, âPleas'd in the simpler paths of Truth to stray? âHast thou the Graces fair âInvok'd with ardent prayer? â'Tis they attire, as Nature must impart, âThe sentiment sublime, the language of the heart. XXIV âThen, if creative Genius pour his ray, âWarm with inspiring influence on thy breast; âTaste, judgment, fancy, if thou canst display, âAnd the deep source of Passion stand confest: âThen may the listening train, âAffected, feel thy strain; âFeel Grief or Terror, Rage or Pity move; âChange with the varying scenes, and every scene approve.â XXV Humbled before her sight, and bending low, I kiss'd the borders of her crimson vest; Eager to speak, I felt my bosom glow, But Fear upon my lip her seal imprest. While awe-struck thus I stood, The bowers, the lawn, the wood, The Form celestial, fading on my sight, Dissolv'd in liquid air, and fleeting gleams of light. AGRICULTURE. A POEM. TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES, THIS ATTEMPT TO DELINEATE SUCH OBJECTS OF PUBLIC VIRTUE, AS BEST MAY DESERVE THE ATTENTION OF A BRITISH PRINCE, IS, WITH THE PROFOUNDEST RESPECT, MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED, BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS's MOST DEVOTED, MOST OBEDIENT, AND MOST HUMBLE SERVANT, THE AUTHOR. CANTO THE FIRST. ARGUMENT. The Proposition. Address to the Prince of WALES. Invocation to the Genius of Britain. Husbandry to be encouraged, as it is the source of wealth and plenty. Advice to Landlords not to oppress the Farmer. The Farmer's three great virtues. His instruments of husbandry. His servants. Description of a country statute. Episode of the fair milkmaid. The farm-yard described. The pleasures of a rural life. Address to the Great to study Agriculture. An allegory, attempting to explain the theory of Vegetation. Of Culture, and the various fruits of earth; Of social Commerce; of the nobler Arts, Which polish and adorn the life of man: Objects demanding the supreme regard Of that exalted Monarch, who sustains The scepter of command o'er Britain's sons; The Muse, disdaining idle themes, attempts To sing. O Thou, Britannia's rising hope! The favourite of her wishes! Thou, O Prince, On whom her fondest expectations wait, Accept the verse; and, to the humblest voice That sings of Public Virtue, lend an ear. Genius of Britain! Pure Intelligence! Guardian, appointed by the One supreme, With influential energy benign, To guide the weal of this distinguish'd isle; O wake the breast of her aspiring son, Inform his numbers, aid his bold design, Who, in a daring flight, presumes to mark The glorious track her Monarchs should pursue. From Cultivation, from the useful toils Of the laborious hind, the streams of wealth And plenty flow. Deign then, illustrious Youth! To bring th' observing eye, the liberal hand, And with a spirit congenial to Your birth, Regard his various labours thro' the year: So shall the labourer smile, and You improve The happy Country You are born to rule. The year declining, now hath left the fields Divested of their honours: the strong glebe, Exhausted, waits the culture of the plough, To renovate her powers. 'Tis now, intent On honest gain, the cautious husbandman Surveys the country round, sollicitous To fix his habitation on a soil Propitious to his hopes, and to his cares. O ye, whom Fortune in her silken robe Enwraps benign; whom Plenty's bounteous hand Hath favour'd with distinction: O look down, With smiles indulgent, on his new designs; Assist his useful works, facilitate His honest aims, nor in Exaction's gripe Enthrall th' endeavouring swain. Think not his toils Were meant alone to foster you in ease And pamper'd indolence: nor grudge the meed, Which Heaven in mercy gives to chear the hand, The labouring hand of useful Industry. Be yours the joy to propagate Content; With bounteous Heaven co-operate, and reward The poor man's toil, whence all your riches spring. As in a garden, the enlivening air Is fill'd with odours, drawn from those fair flowers Which by its influence rise: so in his breast Benevolent, who gives the swains to thrive, Reflected live the joys his virtues lent. But come, young Farmer, tho' by Fortune fix'd On fields luxuriant, where the fruitful soil Gives Labour hope; where sheltering shades arise, Thick fences guard, and bubbling fountains flow; Where arable and pasture duly mix; Yet, ere thy toils begin, attend the Muse, And catch the moral lessons of her song. Be frugal and be blest; Frugality Will give thee competence; thy gains are small, Too small to bear Profusion's wasteful hand. Make Temperance thy companion, so shall Health Sit on thy brow, invigorating thy frame To every useful work. And if to these Thou happily shalt join one virtue more, The love of Industry, the glowing joy Felt from each new improvement; then fair Peace, With modest Neatness, in her decent garb, Shall walk around thy dwelling: while the Great, Tir'd with the vast fatigue of Indolence, Fill'd with disease by Luxury and Sloth, Impatient curse the dilatory day, And look with envy on thy happier state. Prepar'd with these plain virtues, now the swain With courage enters on his rural works. First he provides the needful implements. Of these, the honour'd plough claims chief regard. Hence bread to man, who heretofore on mast Fed with his fellow brute, in woods and wilds, Himself uncultur'd as the soil he trod. The spiked harrow next, to break the clods, And spread the surface of the new-plough'd field: Nor is the roller's friendly aid unsought. Hoes he provides, with various arms prepar'd, T' encounter all the numerous host of weeds, Which rise malignant, menacing his hopes. The sweeping scythe's keen edge he whets for grass, And turns the crooked sickle for his corn. The fork to spread, the gathering rake to save With providential care he treasures up. His strong capacious wain, the dull slow ox Drags on, deep loaden, grinding the rough ruts: While with his lighter team, the sprightly horse Moves to the music of his tinkling bells. Nor will his foresight lack the whirling flail, Whose battering strokes force from the loosen'd sheaves Their hidden stores profuse; which now demand The quick rotation of the winnowing fan, With blasts successive, wafting far away The worthless chaff, to clear the golden grain. And now compell'd to hire assistant strength, Away he hastens to some neighbouring town, Where willing Servitude, for mutual wants Of hind and farmer, holds her This is called in the country a Statute; and is held annually at most market towns in England, where servants of all kinds resort in quest of places and employment. annual feast. 'Tis here the toiling hand of Industry Employment seeks. The skilful ploughman, lord And leader of the rustic band; who claims His boy attendant, conscious of his worth And dignity superior; boasting skill To guide with steadiness the sliding share, To scatter with an equal hand the seed, And with a master scythe to head the train When the ripe meadow asks the mower's hand. Here too the thrasher, brandishing his flail, Bespeaks a master, whose full barns demand A labouring arm, now ready to give up Their treasure, and exchange their hoarded grain For heaps of gold, the meed of honest toil. The sun-burnt shepherd too, his slouching hat Distinguish'd well with fleecy locks, expects Observance; skill'd in wool, and lesson'd deep In all diseases of the bleating flock. Mixt with the rustic throng, see ruddy maids, Some taught with dext'rous hand to twirl the wheel, Or stroak the swelling udder; some expert To raise from leaven'd wheat the kneaded loaf; To mash the malted barley, and extract Its flavour'd strength; or with a housewife's care, To keep the decent habitation neat. But now let loose to revelry and sport, In clamorous mirth, indelicate and rude, The boisterous swains, and hoyden nymphs, provoke Outrageous merriment.âYet not alike Is every swain, nor every sylvan maid; As Verulam the pleasing tale records. When Patty, lovely Patty, grac'd the crowd, Pride of the neighbouring plains. Who hath not heard Of Patty, the fair milkmaid? Beautiful As an Arcadian nymph, upon her brow Sate virgin Modesty, while in her eyes Young Sensibility began to play With Innocence. Her waving locks fell down On either side her face in careless curls, Shading the tender blushes in her cheek. Her breath was sweeter than the morning gale, Stolen from the rose or violet's dewy leaves. He ivory teeth appear'd in even rows, Thro' lips of living coral. When she spoke Her features wore intelligence: her words Were soft, with such a smile accompany'd, As lighted in her face resistless charms. Her polish'd neck rose rounding from her breast, With pleasing elegance:âThat lovely breast!â Ah! Fancy, dwell not there, lest gay Desire, Who smiling hovers o'er th' enchanting place, Tempt thy wild thoughts to dangerous extacy. Her shape was molded by the hand of Ease; Exact proportion harmoniz'd her frame; While Grace, following her steps, with secret art Stole into all her motions. Thus she walk'd In sweet simplicity; a snow-white pail Hung on her arm, the symbol of her skill In that fair province of the rural state, The dairy; source of more delicious bowls Than Bacchus from his choicest vintage boasts. How great the power of Beauty! The rude swains Grew civil at her sight; and gaping crowds Wrapt in astonishment, with transport gaze, Whispering her praises in each other's ear. As when a gentle breeze, borne thro' the grove, With quick vibration shakes the trembling leaves, And hushing murmurs run from tree to tree; So ran a spreading whisper thro' the crowd. Young Thyrsis hearing, turn'd aside his head, And soon the pleasing wonder caught his eye. Full in the prime of youth, the joyful heir Of numerous acres, a large freehold farm, Thyrsis as yet from beauty felt no pain, Had seen no virgin he could wish to make His wedded partner. Now his beating heart Feels new emotion; now his fixed eye With fervent rapture dwelling on her charms, Drinks in delicious draughts of new-born Love. No rest the night, no peace the following day Brought to his struggling heart: her beauteous form, Her fair perfections playing on his mind, With pleasing anguish torture him. In vain He strives to tear her image from his breast; Each little grace, each dear bewitching look, Returns triumphant, breaking his resolves, And binding all his soul a slave to Love. Ah! little did he know, alas, the while, Poor Patty's tender heart, in mutual pain, Long, long for him had heav'd the secret sigh. For him she drest, for him the pleasing arts She study'd, and for him she wish'd to live. But her low fortunes, nursing sad despair, Check'd the young hope; nor durst her modest eyes Indulge the smallest glances of her flame, Left curious Malice, like a watchful spy, Should catch the secret, and with taunts reveal. Judge then the sweet surprize when she at length Beheld him, all irresolute, approach; And gently taking her fair trembling hand, Breathe these soft words into her listening ear. âO Patty! dearest maid! whose beauteous form âDwells in my breast, and charms my soul to love, âAccept my vows; accept a faithful heart, âWhich from this hour devotes itself to thee: âWealth has no relish, life can give no joy, âIf you forbid my hopes to call you mine.â Ah! who the sudden tumult can describe Of struggling passions rising in her breast? Hope, fear, confusion, modesty, and love Oppress her labouring soul:âShe strove to speak, But the faint accents dy'd upon her tongue: Her fears prevented utterance.âAt lengthâ âCan Thyrsis mock my Poverty? Can he âBe so unkind? O no! Yet I, alas, âToo humble even to hopeââNo more she said; But gently as if half unwilling, stole Her hand from his; and, with sweet modesty, Casting a look of diffidence and fear, To hide her blushes, silently withdrew. But Thyrsis read, with rapture in her eyes The language of her soul. He follow'd, woo'd, And won her for his wife. His lowing herds Soon call her mistress; soon their milky streams Coagulated, rise in circling piles Of harden'd curd; and all the daries round, To her sweet butter yield superior praise. But turn, my Muse, nor let th' alluring form Of Beauty lead too far thy devious steps. See where the Farmer, with a master's eye, Surveys his little kingdom, and exults In sov'reign independance. At a word, His feathery subjects in obedience flock Around his feeding hand, who in return Yield a delicious tribute to his board, And o'er his couch their downy plumage spread. The peacock here expands his eyeful plumes, A glittering pageant, to the mid-day sun: In the stiff awkwardness of foolish pride, The swelling turkey apes his stately step, And calls the bristling feathers round his head. There the loud herald of the morning struts Before his cackling dames, the passive slaves Of his promiscuous pleasure. O'er the pond, See the grey gander, with his female train, Bending their lofty necks; and gabbling ducks, Rejoicing on the surface clap their wings; Whilst wheeling round, in airy wanton flights, The glossy pigeons chace their sportive loves, Or in soft cooings tell their amorous tale. Here stacks of hay, there pyramids of corn, Promise the future market large supplies: While with an eye of triumph he surveys His piles of wood, and laughs at Winter's frown. In silent rumination, see the kine, Beneath the walnut's shade, patiently wait To pour into his pails their milky stores. While pent from mischief, far from sight remov'd, The bristly herd, within their fatt'ning styes, Remind him to prepare, in many a row, The gaily-blooming pea, the fragrant bean, And broad-leav'd cabbage, for the ploughman's feast. These his amusements, his employment these; Which still arising in successive change, Give to each vary'd hour a new delight. Peace and Contentment with their guardian wings Enclose his nightly slumbers. Rosy Health, When the gay lark's sweet matin wakes the morn, Treads in his dewy foot-steps round the field; And Chearfulness attends his closing day. No racking jealousy, nor sullen hate, Nor fear, nor envy, discompose his breast. His only enemies the prowling fox, Whose nightly murders thin the bleating fold; The hardy badger; the rapacious kite, With eye malignant on the little brood, Sailing around portentous; the rank stote Thirsting, ah, savage thirst! for harmless blood; The corn devouring partridge; timorous hare; Th' amphibious otter bold; the weasel sly, Pilfering the yolk from its enclosing shell; And moles, a dirty undermining race. These all his foes, and these, alas, compar'd With man to man, an inoffensive train. 'Gainst these, assisted by th' entangling net, Th' explosive thunder of the level'd tube, Or toils unweary'd of his social friend The faithful dog, he wages rural war, And health and pleasure in the sportive field Obtaining, he forgives their venial crimes. O happy he! happiest of mortal men! Who far remov'd from slavery as from pride, Fears no man's frown, nor cringing waits to catch The gracious nothing of a great man's nod: Where the lac'd beggar bustles for a bribe, The purchase of his honour; where Deceit, And Fraud, and Circumvention, drest in smiles, Hold shameful commerce; and beneath the mask Of Friendship and Sincerity, betray. Him, nor the stately mansion's gilded pride, Rich with whate'er the imitative arts, Painting or sculpture, yield to charm the eye; Nor shining heaps of massy plate, enwrought With curious, costly workmanship, allure. Tempted nor with the pride nor pomp of Power, Nor pageants of Ambition, nor the mines Of grasping Av'rice, nor the poison'd sweets Of pamper'd Luxury, he plants his foot With firmness on his old paternal fields, And stands unshaken. There sweet prospects rise Of meadows smiling in their flow'ry pride, Green hills and dales, and cottages embower'd, The scenes of innocence and calm delight. There the wild melody of warbling birds, And cool refreshing groves, and murmuring springs, Invite to sacred thought, and lift the mind From low pursuits, to meditate the God! Turn then at length, O turn, ye sons of Wealth, And ye who seek, thro' Life's bewildering maze, To tread the paths of Happiness, O turn! And trace her footsteps in the rural walk; In those fair scenes of wonder and delight, Where, to the human eye, Omnipotence Unfolds the map of Nature, and displays The matchless beauty of created things. Turn to the arts, the useful pleasing arts Of Cultivation; and those fields improve Your erring fathers have too long despis'd. Leave not to ignorance, and low-bred hinds, That noblest science, which in ancient time The minds of sages and of kings employ'd, Sollicitous to learn the ways of God, And read his works in Agriculture's school. Then hear the Muse, now entering, hand in hand With sweet Philosophy, the secret bowers Of deep mysterious Nature; there t' explore The causes of Fecundity, and how The various Elements, Earth, Water, Air, And Fire united; the enlivening ray Diurnal; the prolific dews of Night; With all the rolling Seasons of the year; In Vegetation's work their power combine. Whither, O whither, dost thou lead my steps, Divine Philosophy? What scenes are these, Which strike my wondering senses? Lo! enthron'd Upon a solid rock great Nature sits; Her eyes to heaven directed, as from thence Receiving inspiration. Round her head A mingled wreath of fruits and flowers entwines. Her robe, with every motion changing hue, Flows down in plenteous foldings, and conceals Her secret footsteps from the eyes of men. List! list! what harmony, what heavenly sounds Enchant my ravish'd ear? 'Tis ancient Mythologists have thought the universal nature of things to be signify'd by this god; and that his pipe, compos'd of seven reeds, was the symbol of the seven planets, which they say make the harmony of the spheres. Pan, Who on his seven-fold pipe, to the rapt soul Conveys the fancy'd music of the spheres. See by his strains the Elements inspir'd, Join in mysterious work; their motions led By According to Dr. Boerhave and other modern philosophers, all the motion in nature arises from fire; and taking that away, all things would become fixt and immoveable: fluids would become solid; a man would harden into a statue; and the very air would cohere into a firm and rigid mass. active Fire, in windings intricate, But not perplext, nor vague. And who are They? What Pair obeying in alternate rounds The tuneful melody? Majestic one, And grave, lifting her aweful forehead, moves In shadowy silence, borne on raven wings, Which, waving to the measur'd sounds, beat time. A veil obscures her face; a sable stole, Bedeck'd with sparkling gems, conceals her form; And wreaths of bending poppy crown her brow. The other, rais'd on swan-like spreading plumes; Glides gaily on; a milk-white robe invests His frame transparent; in his azure eyes Dwells brightness; while around his radiant head, A shining glory paints his flying robe, With all the colours of the watry bow. Proceeding now, in more majestic steps, The varying Seasons join the mystic train. In all the blooming hues of florid youth, Gay Spring advances smiling: on her head A flow'ry chaplet, mixt with verdant buds, Sheds aromatic fragrance thro' the air; While little Zephyrs, breathing wanton gales, Before her flutter, turning back to gaze, With looks enamour'd, on her lovely face. Summer succeeds, crown'd with the bearded ears Of ripening Harvest; in her hand she bears A shining sickle; on her glowing cheek The fervent heat paints deep a rosy blush: Her thin light garment, waving with the wind, Flows loosely from her bosom, and reveals To the pleas'd eye the beauties of her form. Then follows Autumn, bearing in her lap The blushing fruits, which Summer's sultry breath Had mellow'd to her hand. A clustering wreath Of purple grapes, half hid with spreading leaves, Adorns her brow. Her dew-besprinkled locks Begin to fall, her bending shoulders sink, And active vigour leaves her sober steps. Winter creeps on, shrivel'd with chilling cold; Bald his white crown, upon his silver beard Shines the hoar frost, and isicles depend. Rigid and stern his melancholy face; Shivering he walks, his joints benumn'd and stiff; And wraps in northern furrs his wither'd trunk. And now, great Nature pointing to the train Her Heaven-directed hand, they all combine, In measur'd figures, and mysterious rounds, To weave the mazy dance; while to the sound Of Pan's immortal pipe, the Goddess join'd Her voice harmonious; and the listening Muse, Admiring, caught the wonders of her The philosophy of this hymn is built on that experimental foundation, laid by the learned and ingenious Dr. Hales, in his Vegetable Statics.

CANTO THE SECOND. ARGUMENT. Of different soils, and their culture. Mr. Tull's principles and practice. Of the principles and practice of the Middlesex gardeners. Of various manures, and other methods of improving lands. Of hedging and ditching. Of planting timber trees. Of draining wet, and flooding dry lands. Of gardening, and the gardens of Epicurus. Descending now from these superior themes, O Muse, in notes familiar, teach the swain The hidden properties of every glebe, And what the different Culture each requires, The Naturalist, to sand, or loam, or clay, Reduces all the varying soils, which cloathe The bosom of this earth with beauty. Sand, Hot, open, loose, admits the genial ray With freedom, and with greediness imbibes The falling moisture: hence the embrio seeds, Lodg'd in its fiery womb, push into life With early haste, and hurry'd to their prime, (Their vital juices spent) too soon decay. Correct this error of the ardent soil, With cool manure: let stiff cohesive clay Give the loose glebe consistence, and firm strength: So shall thy labouring steers, when harvest calls, Bending their patient shoulders to the yoke, Drag home in copious loads the yellow grain. Has Fortune fix'd thy lot to toil in clay? Despair not, nor repine: the stubborn soil Shall yield to Cultivation, and reward The hand of Diligence. Here give the plough No rest. Break, pound the clods, and with warm dungs Relieve the steril coldness of the ground, Chill'd with obstructed water. Add to these The sharpest sand, to open and unbind The close-cohering mass; so shall new pores Admit the solar beam's enlivening heat, The nitrous particles of air receive, And yield a passage to the soaking rain. Hence fermentation, hence prolific power, And hence the fibrous roots, in quest of food, Find unobstructed entrance, room to spread, And richer juices feed the swelling shoots: So the strong field shall to the reaper's hand Produce a plenteous crop of waving wheat. But blest with ease, in plenty shall he live, Whom Heav'n's kind hand, indulgent to his wish, Hath plac'd upon a loamy soil. He views All products of the teeming earth arise In plenteous crops, nor scarce the needful aid Of Culture deigns to ask. Him, nor the fears Of scorching heat, nor deluges of rain Alarm. His kindly fields sustain all change Of seasons, and support a healthy seed, In vigour thro' the perils of the year. But new improvements curious would'st thou learn? Hear then the lore of fair Berkeria's The late Mr. Tull, of Shalborne in Berkshire, in his Horse-hoeing Husbandry; of an Essay on the Principles of Vegetation and Tillage. Son, Whose precepts, drawn from sage experience, claim Regard. The pasture, and the food of plants, First let the young Agricolist be taught: Then how to sow, and raise the embrio seeds Of every different species. Nitre, Fire, Air, Water, Earth, their various powers combine In Vegetation; but the genuine food Of every plant is earth: hence their increase, Their strength, and substance. Nitre first prepares And separates the concreted parts; which then The watry vehicle assumes, and thro' Th' ascending tubes, impell'd by subtil air, Which gives it motion, and that motion heat, The fine terrestrial aliment conveys. Is earth the food of plants? their pasture then Is earth's inverted surface. This the swain, By ceaseless tillage, or the use of dung, Must or ferment, or pulverize, to fit For due reception of the fibrous roots: But from the streams of ordure, from the stench Of putrefaction, from stercoreous fumes Of rottenness and filth, can sweetness spring? Or grateful, or salubrious food to man? As well might virgin innocence preserve Her purity from taint, amid the stews. Defile not then the freshness of thy field With dung's polluting touch; but let the plough, The hoe, the harrow, and the roller, lend Their better powers, to fructifie the soil; Turn it to catch the sun's prolific ray, Th' enlivening breath of air, the genial dews, And every influence of indulgent heaven. These shall enrich and fertilize the glebe, And Toil's unceasing hand full well supply The dunghill's sordid and extraneous aid. Thus taught the Shalborne Swain; who first with skill Led through the fields the many-coulter'd plough; Who first his seed committed to the ground. Shed from the drill by flow revolving wheels, In just proportion and in even rows; Leaving 'twixt each a spacious interval, To introduce with ease, while yet the grain Expanding crown'd the intermediate ridge, His The hoe-plough. new machine; form'd to exterminate The weedy race, (intruders who devour, But nothing pay) to pulverize the soil, Enlarge and change the pasture of the roots, And to its last perfection raise the crop. He taught, alas, but practis'd ill the lore Of his own precepts. Fell Disease, or Sloth Relax'd the hand of industry: his Farm, His own philosophy disgracing, brought Discredit on the doctrines he enforc'd. Then banish from thy fields the loiterer Sloth; Nor listen to the voice of thoughtless Ease. Him sordidness and penury surround, Beneath whose lazy hand the farm runs wild; Whose heart nor feels the joy improvement gives Nor leaden eye the beauties that arise From labour, sees. Accumulated filth Annoys his crowded steps; even at his door A yellow mucus from the dunghill stands In squalid pools; his buildings unrepair'd, To ruin rush precipitate; his fields Disorder governs, and licentious weeds Spring up uncheck'd: the nettle and the dock, Wormwood and thistles, in their seasons rise, And deadly nightshade spreads his poison round. Ah! wretched he! if chance his wandering child, By hunger prompted, pluck th' alluring fruit! Benumning stupor creeps upon his brain; Wild grinning laughter soon to this succeeds; Strange madness then, and death in hideous form, Mysterious Providence! ah, why conceal'd In such a tempting form, should poisons lurk; Ah, why so near the path of innocents, Should spring their bane? But Thou alone art wise. Thus hath the faithful Muse his lore pursu'd, Who, trusting to the Culture of his plough, Refus'd the dunghill's aid. Yet listen not To doubtful precepts, with implicit faith: Experience to experience oft oppos'd, Leaves truth uncertain. See, what various crops, In quick succession, crown the garden'd fields On Thame's prolific bank. On Culture's hand Alone, do these Horticulists rely? Or do they owe to London's rich manure Those products which its crowded markets fill? Both lend their aid: and both with art improv'd, Have spread the glory of their garden's wide, A theme of wonder to the distant swain. Hence the piazza'd Covent Garden, which is now a market for greens, roots, &amp;c. was formerly a garden belonging to the monks of St. Martin's convent. square, where erst, embower'd In solemn sloth, good Martin's lazy monks Dron'd out their useless lives in pamper'd ease; Now boasts, from Industry's rough hand supply'd, Each various esculent the teeming earth In every changing season can produce. Join then with Culture the prolific strength Of such manure as best inclines to aid Thy failing glebe. Let oily marle impart Its unctuous moisture, or the crumbling The bark of oak, after it hath been used by the tanner. It is frequently made use of for hot-beds, particularly for raising pine-apples; and is called by the gardeners, Tan. tan Its glowing heat. Nor from the gazing herds, Nor bristly swine obscene, disdain to heap Their cooling ordure. Nor the warmer dungs Of fiery pigeons, of the stabled horse, Or folded flock, neglect. From sprinkled foot, From ashes strew'd around, let the damp soil Their nit'rous salts imbibe. Scour the deep ditch From its black sediment; and from the street Its trampled mixtures rake. Green standing pools, Large lakes, or meadows rank, in rotted heaps Of If weeds are suffer'd to stand till they are ripe before they are made this use of, their seeds will fill the ground, and it will be difficult to get them out again. unripe weeds, afford a cool manure. From Ocean's verge, if not too far remov'd, Its shelly sands convey a warm compost, From land and wave commixt, with richness fraught: This the sour glebe shall sweeten, and for years, Thro' chilly clay, its vigorous heat shall glow. But if nor oily marle, nor crumbling tan, Nor dung of cattle, nor the trampled street, Nor weed, nor Ocean's sand, can lend its aid; Then, Farmer, raise immediate from their seeds, The juicy stalks of largely-spreading pulse, Beans, buck-wheat, spurry, or the climbing vetch; These early reapt, and bury'd in the soil, Enrich the parent womb from whence they sprung. Or sow the bulbous turnep; this shall yield Sweet pasture to the flocks, or lowing herds, And well prepare thy land for future crops. Yet not alone to raise, but to secure Thy products from invasion, and divide For various use th' appropriated fields, Disdain not thou to learn. For this, the sloe, The furze, the holly, to thy hand present Their branches, and their different merits boast. But from the nurs'ry thou with care select Quick hawthorn setts, well rooted, smooth and strait: Then low as sinks thy ditch on either side, Let rise in height the sloping bank: there plant Thy future fence, at intervals a foot From each to each, in beds of richest mold. Nor ends the labour here; but to defend Thy infant shoots from depredation deep, At proper distance drive stiff oaken stakes; Which interwove with boughs and flexile twigs, Frustrate the nibbling flock, or brouzing herd. Thus, if from weeds, that rob them of their food, Or choak, by covering from the vital air, The hoe's neat culture keep thy thickening shoots, Soon shall they rise, and to thy field afford A beauteous, strong, impenetrable fence. The linnet, goldfinch, nightingale, and thrush, Here, by security invited, build Their little nests, and all thy labours chear With melody; the hand of lovely May Here strews her sweetest blossoms; and if mixt With stocks of knotted crab, ingrafted fruits, When Autumn crowns the year, shall smile around. But from low shrubs, if thy ambition rise To cultivate the larger tree, attend. From seeds, or suckers, layers, or setts, arise Their various tribes; for now exploded stands The vulgar fable of spontaneous birth, To plant or animal. He then, who, pleas'd, In Fancy's eye beholds his future race Rejoicing in the shades their grandsire gave; Or he whose patriot views extend to raise, In distant ages, Britain's naval power; Must first prepare, inclining to the south, A shelter'd nursery; well from weeds, from shrubs, Clear'd by the previous culture of the plough, From cattle fenc'd, and every peeling tooth. Then from the summit of the fairest tree His seed selected ripe, and sow'd in rills On Nature's fruitful lap: the harrow's care Indulgent covers from keen frosts that pierce Or vermin who devour. The wintry months In embrio close the future forest lies, And waits for germination: but in spring, When their green heads first rise above the earth, And ask thy fostering hand; then to their roots The light soil gently move, and strew around Old leaves, or litter'd straw, to screen from heat The tender infants. Leave not to vile weeds This friendly office; whose false kindness choaks, Or starves the nurslings they pretend to shade. When now four summers have beheld their youth Attended in the nursery, then transplant, The soil prepar'd, to where thy future grove Is destin'd to uprear its leafy head. Avoid the error of impatience. He Who, eager to enjoy the cooling shade His hands shall raise, removes at vast expence Tall trees; with envy and regret shall see His neighbour's infant plants soon, soon outstrip The tardy loiterers of his dwindling copse. But if thy emulation's generous pride Would boast the largest timber strait and strong! Thick let the seedling in their native beds Stand unremov'd; so shall each lateral branch, Obstructed, send its nourishment to raise The towering stem: and they whose vigorous health Exalts above the rest their lofty heads, Aspiring still, shall spread their powerful arms, While the weak puny race, obscur'd below, Sickening, die off, and leave their victors room. Nor small the praise the skilful Planter claims From his befriended country. Various Arts Borrow from him materials. The soft Beech, And close-grain'd Box, employ the turner's wheel, And with a thousand implements supply Mechanic skill. Their beauteous veins the Yew And Phyllerea lend, to surface o'er The cabinet. Smooth Linden best obeys The carver's chissel; best his curious work Displays in all its nicest touches. Birchâ Ah, why should Birch supply the chair? since oft Its cruel twigs compel the smarting youth To dread the hateful seat. Tough-bending Ash Gives to the humble swain his useful plough, And for the peer his prouder chariot builds. To weave our baskets the soft Osier lends His pliant twigs: Staves that nor shrink nor swell, The cooper's close-wrought cask to Chesnut owes. The sweet-leav'd Walnut's undulated grain, Polish'd with care, adds to the workman's art Its varying beauties. The tall towering Elm, Scoop'd into hollow tubes, in secret streams Conveys for many a mile the limpid wave; Or from its height when humbled to the ground, Conveys the pride of mortal man to dust. And last the Oak, king of Britannia's woods, And guardian of her isle! whose sons robust, The best supporters of incumbent weight, Their beams and pillars to the builder give, Of strength immense: or in the bounding deep The loose foundations lay of floating walls, Impregnably secure. But sunk, but fallen From all your ancient grandeur, O ye groves! Beneath whose lofty venerable boughs The Druid erst his solemn rites perform'd, And taught to distant realms his sacred lore, Where are your beauties fled? where but to serve Your thankless country, who unblushing sees Her naked forests longing for your shade. The task, the glorious task, for Thee remains, O Prince belov'd! for Thee, more nobly born Than for Thyself alone, the patriot work Yet unattempted waits. O let not pass The fair occasion to remotest time Thy name with praise, with honour to transmit! So shall Thy country's rising fleets, to Thee Owe future triumphs; so her naval strength, Supported from within, shall fix Thy claim To Ocean's sovereignty; and to Thy ports, In every climate of the peopled earth, Bear Commerce; fearless, unresisted, safe. Let then the great ambition fire Thy breast, For this, Thy native land; Replace the lost Inhabitants of her deserted plains. Let Thame once more on Windsor's lofty hills Survey young forests planted by Thy hand. Let fair Sabrina's flood again behold The The officers on board the Spanish fleet in 1588, called the Invincible Armada, had it in their orders, if they could not subdue the island, at least to destroy the forest of Dean, which is in the neighbourhood of the river Severn. Spaniard's terror rise renew'd. And Trent, From Sherwood's ample plains, with pride convey The bulwarks of her country to the main. O native Sherwood! happy were thy bard, Might these his rural notes, to future time Boast of tall groves, that, nodding o'er thy plain, Rose to their tuneful melody. But, ah! Beneath the feeble efforts of a Muse Untutor'd by the lore of Greece or Rome; A stranger to the fair Castalian springs, Whence happier poets inspiration draw, And the sweet magic of perswasive song, The weak presumption, the fond hope expires. Yet sure some sacred impulse stirs my breast! I feel, I feel, an heavenly guest within! And all-obedient to the ruling God, The pleasing task which he inspires, pursue. And hence, disdaining low and trivial things; Why should I tell of him whose obvious art, To drain the low damp meadow, sloping sinks A hollow trench, which arch'd at half its depth, Cover'd with filtering brush-wood, furze or broom, And surfac'd o'er with earth; in secret streams Draws its collected moisture from the glebe? Or why of him, who o'er his sandy fields, Too dry to bear the sun's meridian beam, Calls from the neighbouring hills obsequious springs, Which led in winding currents thro' the mead, Cool the hot soil, refresh the thirsty plain, While wither'd plants reviving smile around? But sing, O Muse! the swain, the happy swain, Whom Taste and Nature leading o'er his fields, Conduct to every rural beauty. See! Before his footsteps winds the waving walk, Here gently rising, there descending slow Thro' the tall grove, or near the water's brink, Where flowers besprinkled paint the shelving bank, And weeping willows bend, to kiss the stream. Now wandering o'er the lawn he roves, and now Beneath the hawthorn's secret shade reclines: Where purple violets hang their bashful heads, Where yellow cowslips, and the blushing pink, Their mingled sweets, and lovely hues combine. Here, shelter'd from the north, his ripening fruits Display their sweet temptations from the wall, Or from the gay espalier: while below, His various esculents, from glowing beds, Give the fair promise of delicious feasts. There from his forming hand new scenes arise, The fair creation of his Fancy's eye. Lo! bosom'd in the solemn shady grove, Whose reverend branches wave on yonder hill, He views the moss-grown temple's ruin'd tower, Cover'd with creeping ivy's cluster'd leaves; The mansion seeming of some rural God, Whom Nature's choristers, in untaught hymns Of wild yet sweetest harmony, adore. From the bold brow of that aspiring steep, Where hang the nibbling flocks, and view below Their downward shadows in the glassy wave, What pleasing landscapes spread before his eye! Of scatter'd villages, and winding streams, And meadows green, and woods, and distant spires, Seeming, above the blue horizon's bound, To prop the canopy of heaven. Now lost Amidst a glooming wilderness of shrubs, The golden Orange, Arbute ever green, The early-blooming Almond, feathery Pine, Fair The Gelder Rose. Opulus, to Spring, to Autumn dear, And the sweet shades of varying verdure, caught From soft Acacia's gently-waving branch, Heedless he wanders: while the grateful scents Of Sweet-briar, Roses, Honeysuckles wild, Regale the smell; and to th' enchanted eye Mezereon's purple, Laurustinus' white, And pale Laburnum's pendent flowers display Their different beauties. O'er the smooth-shorn grass His lingering footsteps leisurely proceed, In meditation deep:âWhen, hark! the sound Of distant water steals upon his ear; And sudden opens to his pausing eye The rapid rough cascade, from the rude rock Down dashing in a stream of lucid foam: Then glides away, meandring o'er the lawn, A liquid surface; shining seen afar, At intervals, beneath the shadowy trees; Till lost and bury'd in the distant grove. Wrapt into sacred musing, he reclines Beneath the covert of embowering shades; And, painting to his mind the bustling scenes Of Pride and bold Ambition, pities Kings. Genius of Gardens! Nature's fairest Child! Thou who, inspir'd by the Directing Mind Of Heaven, did'st plan the scenes of paradise! Thou at whose bidding rose th' Hesperian bowers Of ancient fame, the fair Aonian mount, Castalian springs, and all th' enchanting groves Of Tempe's vale: O where hast thou been hid? For ages where have stray'd thy steps unknown? Welcome at length, thrice welcome to the shore Of Britain's beauteous Isle; where verdant plains, Where hills and dales, and woods and waters join To aid thy pencil, favour thy designs, And give thy varying landscapes every charm. Drive then The taste for strait lines, regular platforms, and clipt trees, was imported from Holland at the Revolution. Batavia's monsters from our shades; Nor let unhallow'd shears profane the form, Which Heaven's own hand, with symmetry divine, Hath given to all the vegetable tribes. Banish the regular deformity Of plans by line and compass, rules abhor'd In Nature's free plantations; and restore Its pleasing wildness to the garden walk; The calm serene recess of thoughtful man, In Meditation's silent sacred hour. And lo! the progress of thy steps appears In fair improvements scatter'd round the land. Earliest in Chiswick's beauteous model seen: There thy first favourite, in the happy shade To Nature introduc'd, the Goddess woo'd, And in sweet rapture there enjoy'd her charms. In Richmond's venerable woods and wilds, The calm retreat, where weary'd Majesty, Unbending from his cares for Britain's Peace, Steals a few moments to indulge his own. On Oatland's brow, where Grandeur sits enthron'd, Smiling on Beauty. In the lovely vale Of Esher, where the mole glides lingering, loth To leave such scenes of sweet simplicity. In Mr. Southcote's Woburn's ornamented fields, where gay Variety, where mingled lights and shades, Where lawns and groves, and opening prospects break, With sweet surprize, upon the wandering eye. On Hagley's hills, irregular and wild, Where thro' romantic scenes of hanging woods, And vallies green, and rocks, and hollow dales, While Echo talks, and Nymphs and Dryads play, Thou rov'st enamour'd; leading by the hand Its Master, who, inspir'd with all thy Art, Adds beauties to what Nature plan'd so fair.

While thus at ease, beneath embellish'd shades, We rove delighted; lo! the ripening mead Calls forth the labouring hinds. In slanting rows, With still-approaching step, and level'd stroke The early mower, bending o'er his scythe, Lays low the slender grass; emblem of Man, Falling beneath the ruthless hand of Time. Then follows blithe, equipt with fork and rake, In light array, the train of nymphs and swains. Wide o'er the field, their labour seeming sport, They toss the withering herbage. Light it flies, Borne on the wings of Zephyr; whose soft gale, Now while th' ascending sun's bright beam exhales The grateful sweetness of the new-mown hay, Breathing refreshment, fans the toiling swain. And soon, the jocund dale and echoing hill Resound with merriment. The simple jest, The village tale of scandal, and the taunts Of rude unpolish'd wit, raise sudden bursts Of laughter from beneath the spreading oak, Where thrown at ease, and shelter'd from the sun, The plain repast, and wholesome bev'rage cheer Their spirits. Light as air they spring, renew'd, To social labour: soon the ponderous wain Moves slowly onwards with its fragrant load, And swells the barn capacious: or, to crown Their toil, large tapering pyramids they build, The magazines of Plenty, to ensure From Winter's want the flocks, and lowing herds. But do the threatning clouds precipitate Thy work, and hurry to the field thy team, Ere the sun's heat, or penetrating wind, Hath drawn its moisture from the fading grass? Or hath the bursting shower thy labours drench'd With sudden innundation? Ah, with care Accumulate thy load, or in the mow, Or on the rising rick. The smother'd damps, Fermenting, glow within; and latent sparks At length ingender'd, kindle by degrees, Till, wide and wider spreading, they admit The fatal blast, which instantly consumes, In flames resistless, thy collected store. This dire disaster to avoid, prepare A hollow basket, or the concave round Of some capacious vessel; to its sides Affix a triple cord: then let the swains, Full in the center of thy purpos'd heap, Place the obtrusive barrier; raising still As they advance, by its united bands, The wide machine. Thus leaving in the midst An empty space, the cooling air draws in, And from the flame, or from offensive taints Pernicious to thy cattle, saves their food. And now the ruler of the golden day, From the fierce Lion glows with heat intense; While Ceres on the ripening field looks down In smiles benign. Now with enraptur'd eye, The end of all his toil, and its reward, The Farmer views. Ah, gracious Heaven! attend His fervent prayer: restrain the tempest's rage, The dreadful blight disarm; nor in one blast The products of the labouring year destroy! Yet vain is Heaven's indulgence; for when now In ready ranks th' impatient reapers stand, Arm'd with the scythe or sickle:âechoes shrill Of winding horns, the shouts and hallowings loud Of huntsmen, and the cry of opening hounds, Float in the gale melodious, but invade His frighted sense with dread. Near and more near Th' unwelcome sounds approach; and sudden o'er His fence the tall stag bounds: in close pursuit The hunter train, on many a noble steed, Undaunted follow; while the eager pack Burst unresisted thro' the yielding hedge. In vain, unheard, the wretched hind exclaims: The ruin of his crop in vain laments: Deaf to his cries, they traverse the ripe field In cruel exultation; trampling down Beneath their feet, in one short moment's sport, The peace, the comfort of his future year. Unfeeling Wealth! ah, when wilt thou forbear Thy insults, thy injustice to the Poor? When taste the bliss of nursing in thy breast The sweet sensations of Humanity? Yet all are not destroyers: some unspoil'd By Fortune, still preserve a feeling heart. And see the yellow fields, with labourers spread, Resign their treasures to the reaper's hand. Here stands in comely order on the plain, And cluster'd sheafs, the king of golden corn, Unbearded Wheat, support of human life: There rises in round heaps the maltster's hope, Grain which the reaper's care sollicits best By tempting promises of potent beer, The joy, the meed of thirst-creating toil: The poor man's Rye, on which is made a coarse clammy kind of bread, used by the poorer people in many parts of England, on account of its cheapness. clammy fare the sickle reaps; The steed's light provender obeys the scythe. Labour and mirth united, glow beneath The mid-day sun; the laughing hinds rejoice; Their master's heart is open'd, and his eye Looks with indulgence on the gleaning Poor, At length, adorn'd with boughs and garlands gay, Nods the last load along the shouting field. Now to the God of Harvest in a song The grateful Farmer pays accepted thanks, With joy unfeign'd: while to his ravish'd ear The gratulations of assisting swains Are music. His exulting soul expands: He presses every aiding hand; he bids The plenteous feast, beneath some spreading tree, Load the large board; and circulates the bowl, The copious bowl, unmeasur'd, unrestrain'd, A free libation to th' immortal Gods, Who crown with plenty the prolific soil. Hail, favour'd Island! happy Region, hail! Whose temperate skies, mild air, and genial dews, Enrich the fertile glebe; blessing thy sons With various products, to the life of Man Indulgent. Thine Pomona's choicest gift, The tasteful apple, rich with racy juice, Theme of thy envy'd song, Silurian bard; Affording to the swains, in sparkling cups, Delicious bev'rage. Thine, on Cantium's hills, The flow'ry hop, whose tendrils climbing round The tall aspiring pole, bear their light heads Aloft, in pendant clusters; which in Malt's Fermenting tuns infus'd, to mellow age Preserves the potent draught.

With various blessings teems thy fruitful womb. Lo! from the depth of many a yawning mine, Thy fossil treasures rise. Thy blazing hearts, From deep sulphureous pits, consumeless stores Of fuel boast. Thy oil-imbibing Fuller's earth is found in no other country; and as it is of so great a use in the manufacturing of cloth, the exportation of it is prohibited. Dr. Woodward says this fossil is of more value to England than the mines of Peru would be. earth, The fuller's mill assisting, safe defies All foreign rivals in the clothier's art. The builder's stone thy numerous quarries hide; With lime, its close concomitant. The hills, The barren hills of Derby's wildest Peak, In lead abound; soft, fusile, malleable; Whose ample sheets thy venerable domes, From rough inclement storms of wind and rain, In safety clothe. Devonia's ancient mines, Whose treasures tempted first PhÅnicia's sons To court thy commerce, still exhaustless, yield The valued ore, from whence, Britannia, Thou Thine honour'd The learned antiquary, Bochart, is of opinion, that the PhÅnicians, coming to buy tin in the island of Albion, gave it the name of Barat-Anac, that is, the Land or Country of Tin: which being soften'd by the Greeks into Britannia, was adopted by the Romans. This etymology seems to be confirm'd by the Grecians calling the isles of Scilly, Cassiterides, which signifies in Greek, the same as Barat-Anac in PhÅnician. Rapin. name deriv'st. Nor want'st thou store Of that all-useful metal, the support Of ev'ry art mechanic. Hence arise In Dean's large forest numerous glowing kilns, The rough rude ore calcining; whence convey'd To the fierce furnace, its intenser heat Melts the hard mass; which flows, an iron stream, On sandy beds below: and stiffening there, A ponderous lump, but to the hammer tam'd, Takes from the forge, in bars, its final form. But the glad Muse, from subterranean caves Emerging, views with wonder and delight, What numerous products still remain unsung. With fish abound thy streams; thy sheltering woods To fowl give friendly covert; and thy plains The cloven-footed race, in various herds, Range undisturb'd. Fair Flora's sweetest buds Blow on thy beauteous bosom; and her fruits Pomona pours in plenty on thy lap. Thou to the dyer's tinging cauldron giv'st The yellow-staining weed, Weld, commonly call'd Dyer's weed. luteola; The Woad. glastum brown, with which thy naked sons In ancient time their hardy limbs distain'd; Nor the rich Madder, which is used by the dyers for making the most solid and richest red; and as Mortimer observes, was thought so valuable in King Charles the First's time, that it was made a Patent Commodity. But the cultivation of it hath since been so strangely neglected, that we now purchase from the Dutch the greatest part of what we use, to the amount, as Mr. Millar, in his Gardener's Dictionary says he hath been inform'd, of near thirty thousand pounds a year. rubia does thine hand withold. Grateful and salutary spring the plants Which crown thy numerous gardens, and invite To Health and Temperance, in the simple meal, Unstain'd with murder, undefil'd with blood, Unpoison'd with rich sauces, to provoke Th' unwilling appetite to gluttony. For this, the bulbous esculents their roots With sweetness fill; for this, with cooling juice The green herb spreads its leaves; and opening buds, And flowers, and seeds, with various flavours tempt Th' ensanguin'd palate from its savage feast. Nor hath the God of Physick and of Day Forgot to shed kind influence on thy plants Medicinal. Lo! from his beaming rays Their various energies to every herb Imparted flow. He the salubrious leaf Of cordial sage, the purple-flowering head Of fragrant lavendar, enlivening mint, Valerian's fetid smell, endows benign With their cephalic virtues. He the root Of broad angelica, and tufted flower Of creeping chamomile, impregnates deep With powers carminative. In every brake Wormwood and centaury, their bitter juice, To aid Digestion's sickly powes, refine. The smooth Marsh-mallows. althÃ¦a its balsamic wave Indulgent pours.

Thy friendly soil to liquorice imparts Its dulcet moisture, whence the labouring lungs Of panting Asthma find a sure relief. The scarlet poppy, on thy painted fields, Bows his somniferous head, inviting soon To peaceful slumber the disorder'd mind. Lo, from thy baum's exhilarating leaf, The moping fiend, black Melancholy, flies; And burning Febris, with its lenient flood Cools her hot entrails; or embathes her limbs In sudorific streams, that cleansing flow From saffron's friendly spring. Thou too can'st boast The Carduus, call'd by physical writers Carduus benedictus. blessed thistle, whose rejective power Relieves the loaded viscera; and to thee The rose, the violet their emollient leaves On every bush, on every bank, display. These are thy products, fair Britannia, these The copious blessings, which thy envy'd sons, Divided and distinguish'd from the world, Secure and free, beneath just laws, enjoy. Nor dread the ravage of destructive War; Nor black Contagion's pestilential breath; Nor rending Earth's convulsions,âfields, flocks, towns, Swallow'd abrupt, in Ruin's frightful jaws; Nor worse, far worse than all, the iron hand Of lawless power, stretch'd o'er precarious wealth, Lands, liberty, and life, the wanton prey Of its enormous, unresisted gripe. But further now in Vegetation's paths, Thro' cultur'd fields, and woods, and waving crops, The weary'd Muse forbears to wind her walk. To flocks and herds her future strains aspire, And let the listening hinds instructed hear The closing precepts of her labour'd song. Lo! on the side of yonder slanting hill, Beneath a spreading oak's broad foliage, sits The shepherd swain, and patient by his side His watchful dog; while round the nibbling flocks Spread their white fleeces o'er the verdant slope, A landscape pleasing to the painter's eye. Mark his maternal care. The tender race, Of heat impatient, as of pinching cold Afraid, he shelters from the rising sun, Beneath the mountain's western side; and when The evening beam shoots eastward, turning seeks Th' alternate umbrage. Now to the sweetest food Of fallow fields he leads, and nightly folds, T' enrich th' exhausted soil: defending safe From murd'rous thieves, and from the prowling fox, Their helpless innocence. His skilful eye Studious explores the latent ills which prey Upon the bleating nation. The foul mange Infectious, their impatient foot, by oft Repeated scratchings, will betray. This calls For his immediate aid, the spreading taint To stop. Tobacco, in the briny wave Infus'd, affords a wash of sovereign use To heal the dire disease. The wriggling tail Sure indication gives, that, bred beneath, Devouring vermin lurk: these, or with dust Or deaden'd lime besprinkled thick, fall off In smother'd crowds. Diseases numerous Assault the harmless race; but chief the Fiend Which taints with rotteness their inward frame, And sweeps them from the plain in putrid heaps, A nuisance to the smell. This, this demands His watchful care. If he perceives the fleece In patches lost; if the dejected eye Looks pale and languid; if the rosy gums Change to a yellow foulness; and the breath, Panting and short, emits a sickly stench; Warn'd by the fatal symptoms, he removes To rising grounds and dry, the tainted flock; The best expedient to restore that health Which the full pasture, or the low damp moor Endanger'd. But if bare and barren hills, Or dry and sandy plains, too far remov'd, Deny their aid; he speedily prepares Rue's bitter juce, with brine and brimstone mixt, A powerful remedy; which from an horn Injected, stops the dangerous malady. Refulgent Summer now his hot domain Hath carry'd to the tropic, and begins His backward journey. Now beneath the sun Mellowing their fleeces for th' impending shears, The woolly people in full cloathing sweat: When the smooth current of a limpid brook The shepherd seeks, and plunging in its waves The frighted innocents, their whitening robes In the clear stream grow pure. Emerging hence, On litter'd straw the bleating flocks recline; Till glowing heat shall dry, and breathing dews Perspiring soft, again thro' all the fleece Diffuse their oily fatness. Then the swain Prepares th' elastic shears, and gently down The patient creature lays; divesting soon Its lighten'd limbs of their encumbering load. O more than mines of gold, than diamonds far More precious, more important is the fleece! This, this the solid base on which the sons Of Commerce build, exalted to the sky, The structure of their grandeur, wealth, and power! Hence in the earliest childhood of her state, Ere yet her merchants spread the British sail, To earth descending in a radiant cloud, Britannia seiz'd th' invaluable spoil. To Ocean's verge exulting swift she flew; There, on the bosom of the bounding wave, Rais'd on her pearly car, fair Commerce rode Sublime, the goddess of the watry world, On every coast, in every clime ador'd. High waving in her hand the woolly prize, Britannia hail'd and beckon'd to her shore The Power benign. Invited by the Fleece, From whence her penetrating eyes foresaw What mighty honours to her name should rise, She beam'd a gracious smile. Th' obedient winds, Rein'd by her hand, conducted to the beach Her sumptuous car. But more convenient place The muse shall find, to sing the friendly league, Which here commenc'd, to Time's remotest age, Shall bear the glory of the British sail. Cautious and fearful, some in early spring Recruit their flocks; as then the wintry storms Their tender frame hath prov'd. But he whose aim Ambitious should aspire to mend the breed, In fruitful Autumn stocks the bleating field With buxom ewes, that, to their soft desires Indulgent, he may give the noblest rams. Yet not too early to the genial sport Invite the modest ewe; let Michael's feast Commemorate the deed; lest the cold hand Of Winter pinch too hard the new-yean'd lamb. How nice, how delicate appears his choice, When fixing on the sire to raise his flock? His shape, his marks, how curious he surveys? His body large and deep, his buttocks broad Give indication of internal strength: Be short his legs, yet active; small his head; So shall Lucina's pains less pungent prove, And less the hazard of the teeming ewe: Long be his tail, and large his wool-grown ear; Thick, shining, white, his fleece; his hazel eye Large, bold, and cheerful; and his horns, if horns You chuse, not strait, but curving round and round On either side his head. These the sole arms His inoffensive mildness bears; not made For shedding blood, nor hostile war: yet these, When love, all-powerful, swells his breast, and pours Into his heart new courage, these he aims, With meditated fury at his foe. In glowing colours, here the tempted Muse Might paint the rushing conflict, when provok'd, The rival rams, opposing front to front, Spring forth with desperate madness to the fight. But as deter'd by the superior Bard, Whose steps, at aweful distance, I revere, Nor dare to tread; so by the thundering strife Of his majestic fathers of the herd, My feebler combatants appall'd retreat. At leisure now, O let me once again, Once, ere I leave the cultivated fields, My favourite Patty, in her dairy's pride, Revisit; and the generous steeds which grace The pastures of her swain, well-pleas'd, survey. The lowing kine, see, at their 'custom'd hour, Wait the returning pail. The rosy maid, Crouching beneath their side, in copious streams Exhausts the swelling udder. Vessels large And broad, by the sweet hand of Neatness clean'd, Mean-while, in decent order rang'd appear, The milky treasure, strain'd thro' filtering lawn, Intended to receive. At early day, Sweet slumber shaken from her opening lids, My lovely Patty to her dairy hies: There from the surface of expanded bowls She skims the floating cream, and to her churn Commits the rich consistence; nor disdains, Though soft her hand, tho' delicate her frame, To urge the rural toil; fond to obtain The country-housewife's humble name and praise. Continu'd agitation separates soon The unctuous particles; with gentler strokes And artful, soon they coalesce: at length, Cool water pouring from the limpid spring Into a smooth-glaz'd vessel, deep and wide, She gathers the loose fragments to an heap; Which in the cleansing wave well-wrought, and press'd To one consistent golden mass, receives The sprinkled seasoning, and of patts, or pounds, The fair impression, the neat shape assumes. Is cheese her care? Warm from the teat she pours The milky flood. An acid juice infus'd, From the dry'd stomach drawn of suckling calf, Coagulates the whole. Immediate now Her spreading hands bear down the gathering curd, Which hard and harder grows; till, clear and thin, The green whey rises separate. Happy swains! O how I envy ye the luscious draught, The soft salubrious beverage! To a vat, The size and fashion which her taste approves, She bears the snow-white heaps, her future cheese; And the strong press establishes its form. But nicer cates, her dairy's boasted fare, The jelly'd cream, or custard, daintiest food, Or cheesecake, or the cooling syllabub, For Thyrsis she prepares; who from the field Returning, with the kiss of love sincere, Salutes her rosy lip. A tender look, Meantime, and chearful smiles, his welcome speak: Down to their frugal board Contentment sits, And calls it feasting. Prattling infants dear Engage their fond regard, and closer tye The band of nuptial love. They, happy, feel Each other's bliss, and both in different spheres Employ'd, nor seek nor wish that cheating charm, Variety, which idlers to their aid Call in, to make the length of lazy life Drag on less heavily. Domestic cares, Her children and her dairy, well divide Th' appropriated hours, and duty makes Employment pleasure. He, delighted, gives Each busy season of the rolling year, To raise, to feed, t'improve the generous horse; And fit for various use his strength or speed. Dull, patient, heavy, of large limbs robust, Whom neither beauty marks, nor spirits fire; Him, to the servile toil of dragging slow The burthen'd carriage; or to drudge beneath A ponderous load impos'd, his justice dooms. Yet, straining in th' enormous cars which crowd Thy bustling streets, Augusta, queen of trade, What noble beasts are seen? sweating beneath Their toil, and trembling at the driver's whip, Urg'd with malicious fury on the parts Where feeling lives most sensible of pain. Fell tyrants, hold! forbear your hell-born rage! See ye not every sinew, every nerve Stretch'd even to bursting? Villains!âbut the Muse, Quick from the savage ruffians turns her eye Frowning indignant. Steeds of hardier kind, And cool tho' spritely, to the travel'd road He destines; sure of foot, of steady pace, Active, and persevering, uncompel'd, The tedious length of many a beaten mile. But not alone to these inferior tribes Th' ambitious swain confines his generous breed. Hark! in his fields, when now the distant sounds Of winding horns, and dogs, and huntsmen's shout, Awake the sense, his kindling hunter neighs: Quick start his ears erect, his beating heart Exults, his light limbs bound, he bears aloft, Rais'd by tumultuous joy, his tossing head; And all impatient for the well-known sport, Leaps the tall fence, and listening to the cry, Pursues with voluntary speed the chace. See! o'er the plain he sweeps, nor hedge nor ditch Obstructs his eager flight; nor straining hills, Nor headlong steeps deter the vigorous steed: Till join'd at length, associate of the sport, He mingles with the train, stops as they stop, Pursues as they pursue, and all the wild Enlivening raptures of the field enjoys. Easy in motion, perfect in his form, His boasted lineage drawn from steeds of blood, He the fleet courser too, exulting shews, And points with pride his beauties. Neatly set His lively head, and glowing in his eye True spirit lives. His nostril wide, inhales With ease the ambient air. His body firm And round, upright his joints, his horny hoofs Small, shining, light; and large his ample reach. His limbs, tho' slender, brac'd with sinewy strength, Declare his winged speed. His temper mild, Yet high his mettled heart. Hence in the race, All emulous, he hears the clashing whips; He feels the animating shouts; exerts With eagerness his utmost powers; and strains, And springs, and flies, to reach the destin'd goal. But lo! the boast, the glory of his stalls, His warrior steed appears. What comely pride What dignity, what grace, attend on all His motions? See! exulting in his strength, He paws the ground impatient. On his brow Courage enthroned sits, and animates His fearless eye. He bends his arched crest, His mane loose-flowing, ruffles in the wind, Cloathing his chest with fury. Proud, he snorts, Champs on the foaming bit, and prancing high, Disdainful seems to tread the sordid earth. Yet hears he and obeys his master's voice, All gentleness: and feels, with conscious pride, His dappled neck clap'd with a cheering hand. But when the battle's martial sounds invade His ear, when drums and trumpets loud proclaim The rushing onset; when thick smoke, when fire Bursts thundering from the cannon's aweful mouth; Then all inspir'd he kindles into flame! Intrepid, neighs aloud; and, panting, seems Impatient to express his swelling joys Unutterable. On Danger's brink he stands, And mocks at Fear. Then springing with delight, Plunges into the wild confusion. Terror flies Before his dreadful front; and in his rear Destruction marks her bloody progress. Such, Such was the steed Thou, Cumberland, bestrod'st, When black Rebellion fell beneath thy hand, Rome and her papal tyranny subdu'd, On great Culloden's memorable field. Such thine, unconquer'd Marlborough, when the throne Of Lewis totter'd, and thy glittering steel On Blenheim's plain immortal trophies reap'd, And such, O Prince! great patron of my theme, Should e'er insidious France again presume On Europe's freedom, such, tho' all averse To slaughtering war, thy country shall present To bear her Hero to the martial plain, Arm'd with the sword of justice. Other cause Ne'er shall Ambition's sophistry perswade Thine honour to espouse. Britannia's peace; Her sacred rights; her just, her equal laws; These, these alone, to cherish or defend, Shall raise thy youthful arm, and wake to war, To dreadful war, the British Lion's rage. But milder stars on thy illustrious birth Their kindest influence shed. Beneath the smile Of thy indulgence, the protected Arts Lifting their graceful heads; her envy'd sail Fair Commerce spreading to remotest climes; And Plenty rising from th' encourag'd Plough; Shall feed, enrich, adorn, the happy land.</field>
