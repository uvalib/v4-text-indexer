      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. INTRODUCTORY. 1. Had I miss'd my way? It would seem so. Still, Scarce past is an hour of the matin prime Since safe I was sitting in front of the mill; Where my first walk ever, this pure May time, Under the beeches, and round by the rill, 'Twixt brawling ripple, and rustling bough, Hath its wonted end, by the brook; that, now When the sweet birds sing together, Carolling clear in the cool, comes down From the breezy hills, and the sunburnt heather; Guided about to his goal unknown By a glimmer of primrose buds new blown, And their breath on the balmy weather. 2. Well, there by the mill, as I say, Where, between them, the brook and the bough For my sake make a musical bower, Safe I sat in the morn of the day; And since there I was sitting, I vow That the day is scarce older an hour. But now? Where am I? who ought to know Every inch of this leafy land. Yet here, but a step at the most, or two, From the door of the well-known mill (Which all the while must be near at hand, For the sound of it follows me still) I am lost in a forest whose glades expand O'er me, before me, immense and dense; Where shadow and sighing sound profound Pour into my spirit a sense intense Of dimness and distance; and, turning around And around myself, I no further have got Than the wheel of that mill, which, the more to confound My confusion, I hear, tho' I see it not. 3. I did well to be on my guard! Tho' my caution avail'd not much. One step more over the sward Which had seem'd so safe and hard, And the grass, or whatever I took for such, Giving suddenly way at my foot's first touch, Down with it, down, I fell Into the depths of a dell Sunless and silent and deep As the dim caverns of sleep. 4. There, thro' the gloom in distress Gazing around, I could see That some four-footed stray-away less Keen of eye, or of footstep steady Than I myself, had been caught already By the snare which had thus caught me. In the hug of those horrible rocks, Unacquainted companions we, Like two vagabonds set in the stocks. But what could the creature be? A fox? Was it, truly, a fox? Ha! how got the rascal here? No matter! he gets not out. 'Tis the end of his bad career. 5. Yet is it a fox? I doubt, Now the gleam of his eyes grow clear Thro' the dim light round about. From the look in those wistful eyes Who could possibly recognise The rogue whose rascalities bold, By farmwife and fabulist told, Have so ruin'd his reputation? What a sadness of resignation! 6. And he seem'd to me wondrous old. 7. I thought, as he eyed me so, He was asking pity from man: Tho' needs must the rascal know Men have put him under their ban. My soul was grieved, I confess, At the sight of the brute's distress, And I mutter'd, “Poor Reynard! I see Thou art lean and grey as a ghost, And the few teeth, age at the most Hath spared thee, are worn to a stump. If I can, I will set thee free. For the miller's pullets, tho' plump, Have nothing to fear from thee. And 'tis never too late to mend. Trust me! I speak as a friend.” 8. He seem'd to understand; Crept closer, and lick'd my hand. “There, there! we are friends. But how To get out of this horrible hole? Ha! some issue, seems yonder: and now Up I climb by the oak-tree bole. Leap on my shoulder. Hold fast. Well clamber'd! welcome the goal! Thou art safe on thy road at last. And I heartily wish I could say As much for myself: but, aghast, I perceive I have miss'd my way.” 9. Yet the creature will not go. He lingers: and still he eyes me With those wonderful eyes, as tho' (Do they bless, beseech, or advise me?) There were something, still, he wanted. “What is it? Speak, then, speak! Nothing can now surprise me; Except that the spell should break. For I think I am here in a forest enchanted, And, if I can grant it, thy prayer is granted.” 10. “Thou hast help'd me. I thank thee, man.” “What magic my fancy mocks?” “And will help thee, too, if I can.” “What art thou?” Sadly the fox Said, “I am the ancient Fox of Fable. Few are the men I have met with, able To understand me; and still more few The men that listen to those who do.” 11. “What!” I exclaim'd, “thou hast known, then, thou, That spiteful hunchback, old Æsop?”—“I know That Æsop,” he answer'd in scorn, “Hath no hump on his honest back; And, never having been born, He never hath died.” “Alack! Thou art, indeed, I perceive, The Fox of Fable! Pray, What next wilt thou have me believe?” 12. “That Æsop is living today.” “Where, prithee?” 13. “In me: in thee: For he lives in each living creature (Man, beast, bird, blossom, and tree), And his life is the love of nature. The complaint, that was half a caress, Men have turn'd into bitterness: The counsel, cordial and bland, To a churlish reprimand: Justice, robed in her ruth, To Resentment eager to smite And Sagacity, Humour, and Truth, Into Sarcasm, Satire, and Spite. Thus, alas! when, to banish the true, A false Æsop you form'd, of your own, We, the children of Æsop, withdrew. For we found that to leave you alone Was then all you had left to us. Few Are the men with whom now we are able To converse, as our wont was of old: And, afar in the Forest of Fable, With, between us, a world sad and cold, Safe we dwell, out of your view. But, O man, thou hast open'd thy heart Unto mine, and thus broken the spell: So my thanks prithee take, ere we part, In the language of Fable. Farewell!” 14. “Stay!” I cried, “one last word, I implore! Must that word be farewell, fellow-creature? May we meet, then, no more, no more, In the motherly arms of Nature? Ah, those friendly voices of yore! Could I hear them, I fain would record All they said to me; writing it down Simply, honestly, true to a word.” 15. “My part I have done. Do thine own,” Said the Fox (as we turn'd, and stood Where, pleasantly welcoming me, Peep'd the mill, once more, thro' the wood) “Love us, and—we shall see.” 16. “Love you?” I cried; “but what use in that, If I never may meet you again? Never mingle among you in brotherly chat! Must I love, and yet seek you in vain?” The Fox hesitated, then sigh'd, “Ah, friend, have you ever yet tried? They fail not to find us, who seek, Though disguised do we go amongst men. Approach, I say, question, and speak Heart to heart with all creatures: and then, . . . Well, hast thou not spoken to me From thy heart? and mine own, was it dumb?” 17. “Then,” I said, “whatsoever they be That I meet, as the chance may come, If I speak to, and question, them all— Bees that hover, and blossoms that hum; The beast of the field or the stall; The trees, leaves, rushes, and grasses; The rivulet, running away; The bird of the air, as it passes; Or the mountains, that motionless stay; And yet whose irremovable masses Keep changing, as dreams do, all day; Will they answer me? Tell me, O tell! For, look you, I love them well.” 18. The Fox, as he turn'd aside, Gave me a friendly glance; And, fading into the forest, replied With encouraging voice, “Perchance. Try!” And so . . . Well, I have tried. I. THE THISTLE. MOTTO. (A Flower's Ballad.) It was a thorn, And it stood forlorn In the burning sunrise land: A blighted thorn, And at eve and morn Thus it sigh'd to the desert sand— “Every flower, By it's beauty's power, With a crown of glory is crown'd. “No crown have I, For a crown I sigh, For a crown that I have not found. “A crown! a crown! A crown of mine own, To wind in a maiden's hair!” Sad thorn, why grieve? Thou a crown shalt weave, But not for a maiden to wear. That crown shall shine When all crowns save thine, With the glory they gave, are gone: For, thorn, my thorn, Thy crown shall be worn By the King of Sorrows alone. PRELUDE. The green grass-blades aquiver With joy at the dawn of day (For the most inquisitive ever Of the flowers of the field are they) Lisp'd it low to their lazy Neighbours that flat on the ground, Dandelion and daisy, Lay still in a slumber sound: But soon, as a ripple of shadow Runs over the whisperous wheat, The rumour ran over the meadow With its numberless fluttering feet: It was told by the water-cresses To the brooklet that, in and out Of his garrulous green recesses, For gossip was gadding about: And the brooklet, full of the matter, Spread it abroad with pride; But he stopp'd to gossip and chatter, And turn'd so often aside, That his news got there before him Ere his journey down was done; And young leaves in the vale laugh'd o'er him “We know it! The snow is gone!” The snow is gone! but ye only Know how good doth that good news sound, Whose hearts, long buried and lonely, Have been waiting, winter-bound, For the voice of the wakening angel To utter the welcome evangel, “The snow is gone: reärise, And blossom as heretofore, Hopes, imaginings, memories, And joys of the days of yore!” What are the tree-tops saying, swaying This way all together? “The winter is past! the south wind at last Is come, and the sunny weather!” The trees! there is no mistaking them, For the trees, they never mistake: And you may tell, by the way of the stem, What the way is, the wind doth take. So, if the tree-tops nod this way, It is the south wind that is come; And, if to the other side nod they, Go, clothe ye warm, or bide at home! The flowers all know what the tree-tops say; They are no more deaf than the trees are dumb. And they do not wait to hear it twice said If the news be good; but, discreet and gay, The awaked buds dance from their downy bed, With pursed-up mouth, and with peeping head, By many a dim green winding way. 'Tis the white anemone, fashion'd so Like to the stars of the winter snow, First thinks, “If I come too soon, no doubt I shall seem but the snow that hath staid too long, So 'tis I that will be Spring's unguess'd scout.” And wide she wanders the woods among. Then, from out of the mossiest hiding-places, Smile meek moonlight-colour'd faces Of pale primroses puritan, In maiden sisterhoods demure; Each virgin flowret faint and wan With the bliss of her own sweet breath so pure. And the borage, blue-eyed, with a thrill of pride, (For warm is her welcome on every side) From Elfland coming to claim her place, Gay garments of verdant velvet takes All creased from the delicate travelling case Which a warm breeze breaks. The daisy awakes And opens her wondering eyes, yet red About the rims with a too long sleep; Whilst, bold from his ambush, with helm on head And lance in rest, doth the bulrush leap. The violets meet, and disport themselves, Under the trees, by tens and twelves. The timorous cowslips, one by one, Trembling, chilly, atiptoe stand On little hillocks and knolls alone; Watchful pickets, that wave a hand For signal sure that the snow is gone, Then around them call their comrades all In a multitudinous, mirthful band; Till the field is so fill'd with grass and flowers That wherever, with flashing footsteps, fall The sweet, fleet, silvery April showers, They never can touch the earth, which is Cover'd all over with crocuses, And the clustering gleam of the buttercup, And the blithe grass blades that stand straight up And make themselves small, to leave room for all The nameless blossoms that nestle between Their sheltering stems in the herbage green; Sharp little soldiers, trusty and true, Side by side in good order due; Arms straight down, and heads forward set, And saucily-pointed bayonet. Up the hillocks, and down again, The green grass marches into the plain, If only a light wind over the land Whisper the welcome word of command. PART I. 'Twas long after the grass and the flowers, one day, That there came straggling along the way A little traveller, somewhat late. Tired he was; and down he sat In the ditch by the road, where he tried to nestle Out of the dust and the noontide heat. Poor little vagabond wayside Thistle! In the ditch was his only safe retreat. Flung out of the field as soon as found there, And banisht the garden, where should he stay? Wherever he roam'd, still Fortune frown'd there, And, wherever he settled, spurn'd him away. From place to place, had he wander'd long The weary high road, parcht with thirst. Now here, in the ditch, for awhile among The brambles hidden, he crouch'd; and first Wistfully eyed, on the other side, A fresh green meadow with flowrets pied; And then, with a pang, as he peep'd and pried, “Oh, to rest there!” he thought, and sigh'd. “Oh, to rest there, it is all so fair! Yonder wanders a brooklet, sure? No! it is only the mill-sluice small. But he looks like a brook, so bright and pure, And his banks are broider'd with violets all. What a hurry he seems to be in! Ah, why Doth he hasten so fast? If I were he, There would I linger, and rest, and try To be left in peace. Take heed! (ah me, He doth not hear me—how weary I am!) Take heed, for the sake of thine old mill-dam, Thou little impetuous fool! I pass'd Over the bridge, as I came by the road; And under the bridge I saw rolling fast A full-grown river, so deep and broad! If you go on running like that—nor look Where you are running—you foolish brook, I predict you will fall into trouble at last, And the great big river will eat you up. That is all you will get by your heedless haste. Oh, if I were you, it is there I'd stop, There where you are, with the flowers and grass. For I know what it is to wander, alas! It is only to fall from bad to worse, And find no rest in the universe. “Soft!—I have half a mind to try— Could one slip in yonder quietly, Where the rippled damp of the deep grass spares Cool rest to each roving butterfly, How pleasant 'twould be! There is nobody by, And perhaps there is nobody owns or cares To look after yon meadow. It seems so still, Silent, and safe—shall I venture?—I will! From the ditch it is but a step or two. And, maybe, the owner is dead, and the heirs Away in the town, and will never know.” PART II. Then the little Thistle atiptoe stood, All in a tremble, sharp yet shy. The vagabond's conscience was not good. He had been so often a trespasser sly, He had been so often caught by the law, He had been so often beaten before: He was still so small: if a spade he saw, He mutter'd a Paternoster o'er, And cower'd. So, cautiously thrusting out Here a timorous leaf, there a tiny sprout, And then dropping a seed, and so waiting anon For a chance lift got from the wind—still on, With a hope that the sun and the breeze migh please To be helpful and kind—by degrees he frees And feels his way with a fluttering heart. In the ditch there were heaps of stones to pass. They scratch'd him, and tore him, and made him smart, And ruin'd his leaves. But those leaves, alas, Already so tatter'd and shatter'd were, That to keep them longer was worth no care; And at last he was safe in the meadow; and there “Ah, ha!” sigh'd the Thistle; “so far, so well! If I can but stay where I am, I shall fare Blithe as the bee in the blossom's bell. How green it is here, and how fresh, and fair! And, oh, what a pleasure henceforth to dwell In this blest abode! to have done with the road, And got rid of the ditch! Ah, who can tell The rapture of rest to the wanderer's breast?” Down out of heaven a dewdrop fell On the head of the Thistle: and he fell asleep In the lap of the twilight soft and deep. PART III. At sunrise he woke: and he still was there, In the bright grass, breathing the balmy air. He stretch'd his limbs, and he shook off the dust, And he wash'd himself in the morning dew; And, opening his pedlar's pack, out-thrust A spruce little pair of leaflets new; And made for himself a fine white ruff, About his neck to wear; And pruned and polish'd his prickles tough; And put on a holiday air. And “If only nobody finds me out!” He laugh'd, as he loll'd among The grass, delighted, and look'd about, And humm'd a homely song; Which he loved because, like himself, 'twas known As a wanderer here and there, “A crown! a crown! A crown of mine own, To wind in a maiden's hair!” But . . . a sweep of the scythe, and a stamp of the foot, And “Vile weed! is there no getting rid of thee ever?” And what little was spared by the scythe, the boot, With its hobnails, hasten'd to crush and shiver. PART IV. 'Twas the Farmer, who just then happen'd to pass. He had gone to the field to cut some grass For his beast that morn; and no sooner saw The trespasser there in flagrante delicto, Than, scythe in hand, he enforced the law On the luckless offender, vi et ictu. All mangled and bruised, the poor little Thistle With his desperate roots to the soil clung fast. The Farmer away, with a careless whistle, Homeward over the meadow pass'd. The Thistle breathed freër, and shook his gasht head. “All's well, if it be no worse!” he said. “My crown is gone, but 'twill grow again. There is many another (I feel it) in me. And one must not make too much of the pain. Only, you good saints, let me not be Forced, for my sins, to return to the road! Only not that! If I can but contrive To rest here, somehow or other! I see One may lose his head in this brave abode. But I'm on my guard, and I'll struggle and strive, As long as I live, to keep alive.” Then his roots he burrow'd more deep and broad. But every day 'twas the self-same thing! Tho' he made himself little, and hid his head, Trying, with all his might, to cling Close to the soil, and appear to be dead. For his spacious leaves, that were carved and curl'd For Corinthian columns in temples fair, He could not check them when these unfurld Their flourishing architecture there, And, all about him their beauty spreading, Layer on layer uprose from below; And the hardy young head, in despite of beheading, Sprang up again—for the scythe to mow! Round and about him, each blossom was blowing. No chance of blowing had he found ever: Who no sooner was seen than the sharp steel mowing, Or the harsh foot crushing him, stopp'd the endeavour. And “Oh, blessèd,” he sigh'd, “is the blossom that blows! Colours I know of, no eyes yet see. But I dare not show them; and nobody knows, Nobody guesses, what's hidden in me! In all the world but one creature, alas, For love's sake seeks me; and he is an ass.” PART V. So went the Spring: and so came and went The Summer. The aftermath was mown: And there where, erewhile, in one element Of colour and odour together blent, By the balmy breath of the light wind blown, The flowing grass and the bending blooms (A rapturous river of gleams and glooms!) Had rippled and roll'd, lay clods of mould Black and bald; and between them grew Coarse aftergrowths, grey, bristly, and cold; And the beast of the field had the residue. The primrose, cowslip, and violet, With their glow-worm glitter were gone; and the white Anemone's constellations, set, Had left the earth dark as a starless night, Where the grass fell off from the woodland wet. The blue-eyed borage was blinded quite. But, outliving his betters one by one, In the flowerless field, with no thought of flight, The brave little Thistle remain'd—alone! And, since skies were cold, and suns were dim, No one noticed, and no one praised, But also no one maltreated, him. And the pensive beasts of the field, that grazed The twice-cropt grass, where their wandering whim Led them, lazy, from spot to spot, Shunn'd the Thistle and harm'd him not. PART VI. Then the Thistle, at last, could enlarge his store Of the few joys fate had vouchsafed him sparely. Baffled a hundred times, and more, Bruised, and torn, and surviving barely, Still he survived: and for him, him only, Green leaves gladden'd the leafless cold Where, Summer's orphan, he linger'd lonely Over her grave in the frozen mould. For, as days, long dead, by a bard born after Are invoked, and revive in a form more fair, All the bliss that was beauty, the life that was laughter, Ere the frolic fields were bereft and bare, The lone Thistle renew'd and transform'd to his own; As flower by flower—from the fervid rose, Whose beauty so well to herself is known, That she blushes proud of the truth she knows, To the violet, Modesty's vanquisht child, Hiding her head in the sylvan places Where her wandering wooer, the March gust wild, Hath left her faint from his harsh embraces, All of them—all, in a dream divine To the heart of the Thistle sweet secrets told Of blushes that burn, and of brows that shine, With passion of purple and glory of gold. So all flowers of the field were alive in one: And the glow of his sheen, and the gloss of his down, Were as jewels dead queens have confided alone To the craftsman who fashions them all to a crown. For each hope in the heart of the poor plant hidden Each vision of bliss and of beauty, nurst, With a passion by Prejudice check'd and chidden, For a life by the fiat of Fortune curst, Rushing forthwith into rich reality, Fill'd the cup of a quenchless thirst Till it flow'd with exuberant prodigality, And his long-pent life into blossom burst. A single blossom: but statelier far, And fairer, than many a million are. A splendid disc, full and flashing with wonder! As the sea-rose swims on the water, so That effulgent star on the bleak earth under Lay spread out in a luminous glow. And “At last I can blossom! blossom! blossom!” The Thistle laugh'd, greeting the earth and heaven, And he blossom'd his whole heart out of his bosom. And all was forgotten, save all that was given. II. POSSESSION. A Poet loved a Star, And to it whisper'd nightly, “Being so fair, why art thou, love, so far? Or why so coldly shine, who shinest so brightly? O Beauty, woo'd and unpossest, O might I to this beating breast But clasp thee once, and then die, blest!” That Star her Poet's love, So wildly warm, made human. And, leaving for his sake her heaven above, His Star stoop'd earthward, and became a Woman. “Thou who hast woo'd and hast possest, My lover, answer, which was best, The Star's beam, or the Woman's breast?” “I miss from heaven,” the man replied, “A light that drew my spirit to it.” And to the man the woman sigh'd, “I miss from earth a poet.” III. WHO'S IN THE RIGHT? PRELUDE. A battery, posted in haste, at last, On the brow of a hill in the foeman's flank, Had decided the fate of the day. Fast, fast, In many a broken and billowy rank The bewilder'd rear of his battle fled. But, rapid behind, like a rushing wind That rattles with hail, to the lowland red Down from the ridge of the smoky hill, The cavalry clash'd in a clattering shower; Crushing the harvest, and chasing still All that was left of a nation's power. And wide it swept over the wasted plain, That rapture of ruin, red in the glare Of burning barns; and the bolted rain Sang thro' the blacken'd and sulphurous air, As in storm it stream'd and subsided again; Till all was still save the far-off blare Of a ghostly bugle, echoing chill; Whose echoes, heard by the yet unslain O'er leagues of litter, from hill to hill Proclaim'd that the hurly-burly was done: A kingdom lost and a kingdom won! PART I. 1. In that hollow battery's earthen mound, Gaily gather'd the guns around, The officers, free at the fall of the day, Were discussing with whom the achievement lay Of so great a success. And said one of them, “Friends, “Was there ever a captain so skill'd in war As our gallant Prince? Bright Victory wends With him, wherever his flag flies, far From city to city; and lucky are we Whose fortunes follow the guiding star Of a hero, whose genius, all agree, Is as great as his glorious actions are.” Another, in answer, his shoulders shrugg'd, And “Ay,” as his shaggy beard he tugg'd, “So is every conqueror styled,” quoth he, “Though owed to others his conquests be. But the few to whom war's art is known Know 'tis the General Staff alone That organises and orders all; To each arm of the service assigns that place Where best the effect of its force may fall, And the plan of the whole campaign doth trace.” “'May be,” said a third, “that by these and those, In a general way, is good service done. No fruit can ripen, of course one knows, Without the assistance of soil and sun. But the question is—when your fruit is ripe, How to pluck it.” (And here, his pipe He lit, as he added) “That, you see, “Can only be done by the Cavalry.” “You forget,” said a fourth, an Engineer, “The man who posted this battery here. The foe had out-number'd us, ten to one, And would, but for him, have o'erwhelm'd us too.” “Posted the battery? Easily done!” A sergeant mutter'd. “Forget not, you, “Which of us was it, that pointed the gun.” 2. 'Neath the battery wall where these conversed, A wounded gunner unheeded lay; By a random shell, that had near him burst, His feet were shatter'd and shorn away. His lips were baked by a burning thirst, On his limbs did the icy ague prey: The yet smouldering brand in his frozen hand He grasp'd; and follow'd, with eyes aflame, The far-off blaze, that greeted his gaze With the deadly effect of his life's last aim. Not a word had he heard Of the talk around him. He died. And, with pride In death dealt, death crown'd him. Pain's parcht furrows placidly glided Out of his weather-beaten face; But a silent smile of triumph slided, Under death's hovering hand, in their place; And death, for a sign, congeal'd it there, Stern, and fair. 3. Now, of all the glory that gilt that day Not a gleam yet glows in these after ages. All that glitter'd hath faded away; All, save the name of the Prince; in her pages By History written, though seldom read. All else is dead. PART II. 1. Clio, with clarion, palm, and book, Pass on! Not thine are we. Thy plainer sister's shepherd crook We follow; seeking flowers forsook, That breathe about the rural brook, And win the wandering bee. What History oft, in stately pride, With haughty gesture spurns aside, Wild Fable from the wayside field Picks up, and lays to heart. And truths, by her to us reveal'd, Do we to you impart: 2. How that bronze tube, round which erewhile This discussion was carried so high, Mock'd, as it listen'd, and said with a smile, “Men boast, but the victor am I!” “Thou?” growl'd the Cannon Ball—“thou! is it thou Who didst level yon walls with the plain, Mowing down men, as the harvesters mow Hollow paths thro' the thick of the grain? Braggart! 'tis I who alone can do this. 'Tis the brush of my brazen orb bursts wide War's mason'd masses!”—Whereto, with a hiss, “Silence, blockhead!” the Powder replied. “On the arsenal floor had'st thou rested still, Were it not for me, who thy wings provide. And thou art but the deed: it is I am the will.” But, as thus he mutter'd, with surly pride, “Vagabond!” scornfully splutter'd the Match, “Boast not thou in thy master's presence! Ball, Cannon, and Powder,—inert batch Of base stuff, stirr'd by my quickening essence,— The Fire am I, and my slaves are ye. He, whose vitals a vulture tore, Well was he 'ware of the worth of me, When from heaven he stole, in the days of yore, The spark that in my Promethean wand Yet glows with the heat of a god's invention.” 3. “Attention!” An officer cried, in command. 4. For faint, and afar, with a dying spasm, The bruised-out battle was breathing again. And the gun was charged, from his gaping chasm, To clear it away from the cumber'd plain Where it crawl'd in pain. 5. The gunner pointed the gun to the mark. With an eager spark The ardent match, death's nimble adept, To the touch-hole leapt, And. . . . went out in the dark. Not a groan, not a flame, from the great gun came, Not a belch of smoke: unejected slept In his burthen'd gullet the sullen bullet: The captains were cursing, the gunners were grumbling, And, drop upon droplet, as down it came tumbling, Merrily, mockingly laugh'd the light Shower: “O fools! lo, I sprinkle a silvery twinkle Of beads from my bosom, and where is your power? Black dust of death, art thou melted quite Into a harmless unsavoury sop? What of your lightnings? where is their light? Quencht in a quagmire, slain by a slop! Your valorous thunders, voices of might? Struck dumb by a dancing drop!” 6. The dying Fire heard this, And with a hiss Spat out the scorn of his indignant hate, “Demon of Impotence! Boast not that thou art great, Upon the poor pretence Of greatness hinder'd and defeated by thee. Force to annihilate Force, hast thou: but the gods deny thee Force to create.” 7. “Stay, not so fast!” Sighingly answer'd him the streaming Rain. “Destroyer, what hast thou created? Cast On thy brief work (death, devastation, pain) One glare—thy last! Show me thy greatness. Is it yonder plain Where thou hast pass'd, Leaving behind thee hideous heaps of slain And ruin vast? Lo, with my little drops, I bless again And beautify the fields which thou didst blast! Rend, wither, waste, and ruin, what thou wilt, But call not Greatness what the gods call Guilt. Blossoms and grass from blood in battle spilt, And poppied corn, I bring. 'Mid mouldering Babels, to Oblivion built, My violets spring. Little by little, my small drops have strength To deck with green delights the grateful earth: Little by little, to large seas at length Small springs give birth: By little things the growing world grows great, And of great doings rests but little done: From little fibres in the loom of Fate Time's robe is spun: Small are the cymbals that, when clasht, proclaim The march of Force: from shafts of tiny stature Co-operant atoms build the crystal frame Of mighty Nature. By little ducts Thought's widening river runs Thro' nerve and brain, yet fills the ages vast, And even the secret of the central suns Invades at last: In little waves light leaps from star to star: Small pencils paint the welkin's azure pall: And small life's primal universes are, Yet they are all.” IV. PREMATURITY. 1. If aught in nature be unnatural, It is the slaying by a springtide frost Of Spring's own children: cheated blossoms all, Betray'd i' the birth, and born for burial Of budding promise, scarce beloved ere lost! Once, in the silence of a clear Spring night, This still, cold-footed Frost, with footstep light Slid thro' the tepid season, like a ghost Wrapt in thin white. Flitting, he smote the first-born of the year, And, ere the break of day, their pretty buds were sere. 2. But the blossoms that perish'd Were those alone Which, in haste to be cherish'd, With loosen'd zone Had too soon to the sun all their beauty shown. Lightly-vested, Amorous-breasted, Blossom of almond, blossom of peach: Impatient children, with hearts unsteady, So young, and yet more precocious each Than the leaves of the Summer, and blushing already! 3. These perish'd, because too soon they lived; But the oak flower, prudent and proud, survived. “If the sun would win me,” she thought, “he must Wait for me, wooing me warmly the while; For a flower's a fool, if a flower would trust Her whole sweet being to one first smile.” V. ANCIENTS AND MODERNS. 1. I' the city of the ruins of the world A rumour flutter'd, on that breeze unfurl'd Whose puff-cheek'd AEolus is Public Prate, That some vine's owner, digging the estate Of classic dirt which lodged his lucky vine, Had stumbled on a statue, Greek, and fine. 2. Priests, princes, populace—Rome's papal fold Prolific—rams and lambs—the young, the old— The learnèd and unlearnèd—all came flocking (Some clad in scarlet hat and purple stocking; Some, with no stockings, and no hats at all; But each as blithe as for a festival) To gaze, and praise, and bless the favour'd spot, Whence Rome, renascent, such a prize had got Back from the ruins of herself. For there, In radiant resurrection, fresh and fair As when that statue first with classic grace The clement Caesar's palace deck'd, i' the place Where sank the baths of Titus from the sun, Apollo's patriot priest, Laöcoön, Reveal'd to Roman crowds, now Christian grown, That Pagan Anguish which, in Parian stone, The Rhodian artist had express'd so well That here for ever Pain hath Beauty's spell. 3. Down in the wreck and rummage of the ground Wherein this famous statue had been found, A snake, emergent from his clayey chasm, Had watch'd with wonder Rome's enthusiasm. And, when the crowd was gone, the reptile gazed Upon the statue which the crowd had praised. Laöcoön, and his sons, this snake esteem'd But secondary parts of what he deem'd The sculptor's main design. As what one sees (When painted, haply, by the Veronese) Most to admire in Cana's banquet board, For nuptial feast with goodly goblets stored And viands spread—is not the wine and meat, But the brave guests who drink it and who eat; So, what this reptile deem'd the chiefest part Of the whole group, and of its artist's art The choicest specimen, was—naturally— Not the mere victims of the slaughterous sally Made by its kind on the Laöcoöns, (Not even the father, and much less the sons) Who for those snakes were as a banquet spread, But the snakes' selves, who on that banquet fed. 4. And “Is that all?” the ambitious reptile cried, “As much, and more can I!” Then, puft with pride, About the statue of a wrestler old, That stood thereby, his fluctuous rings he roll'd, Regurgitating gulfy waves, that wound In sliding sinuous ripple round and round; Knotted the athlete's knees in cumbrous coil, Clove to his stretcht throat, and with slimy toil Strove to crush flat the swoll'n and starting throng Of bulky sinews that, like bulwarks strong, Buttress'd the large limbs of the marble man. Thrice round the raised right arm the reptile ran His rolling orbs; and, winding in and out, With clasp convulsive girt the breast about. 5. In vain! For not one massive muscle shrank, Bruised by the writhing worm's embrace; nor sank The raised right arm; nor groan'd the granite breast. And the mute mouth its marble smile compress'd, Calm as before, 'twixt serious lips serene. Naught marr'd that noble form's majestic mien, And gesture stern. The sole disfigurement Was its aggressor's; as, with strength nigh spent, The serpent strain'd. The sole contortion shown Was all its reptile rival's; not its own. 6. When the great gods, grown jealous of great men, Great vengeance take on human greatness; when One grandeur to another, grander still, Succumbs; when the Divinity, whose will Goads man with agony, doth not disdain To beautify the expression of man's pain; When he, who doth with equal power inspire The harmonious strings of the delightful lyre And the fell serpent fangs of Tenedos, Is King Apollo; then, with loss on loss, Albeit the waves of blind Oblivion Wash out wide empires as they wander on, Tho' slowly over temple, tower, and town, Grow green the grass of Lethe's drowsy down, And the dull weed of dark Forgetfulness, Round spotless statues its accurst caress Do creeping wind,—yet this the gods vouchsafe: If from the deep men save one wandering waif Of wrecks that once immortal shapes have borne, Still of some grace divine not all forlorn Men's lives are left. One fragment, if no more, Of those great forms great thoughts have fill'd of yore, Suffices Beauty to reveal her will, Marr'd, murder'd, buried, but triumphant still! 7. Well-meaning, but unwise, contortionists Of our well-meaning times, whose tragic twists Try modern nerves, appease your emulous rage On the limp substance of the living age, But touch not ye the antique marble. Chill To your embrace, and unresponsive still, Its firm long-frozen grain will foil for ever The feeble fierceness of your fangs' endeavour. For, O ambitious snakes! tho' snakes you be, You are not snakes of Tenedos: nor we Laöcoöns; nor the wrath you represent The wrath of an Apollo. Be content To writhe in elegiac ecstasies Round subjects fitted to your strength and size. Feed on fresh food. But seek no second feasts From the old Sun-God's long-since-perisht priests. VI. A PROVISION FOR LIFE. A Pine-tree bless'd its favour'd fate, because Room to grow barely 'twixt the grudging jaws Of one of the chapt sandstone's gravell'd flaws It found: where early chance had cast its lot On a bare rock, with leave to thrive, or not, As later chance might choose, in that chill spot. “Ah, what good fortune!” sigh'd the grateful tree, “That in this fissure the wind planted me! But for its inch of earth, what should I be?” Fool! Thy good fortune was not the bestowing Of that scant handful of earth's overflowing. It was—and is—thy faculty of growing. To E. L., WITH FABLES VII. AND VIII. Fair soul, that o'er mine own dost shine So fair, so far above, Dear heart, that hast so close to mine The home of thy true love: Be thine these songs of Far and Near! Two worlds their sources are: Each makes the other doubly dear, The near one and the far. VII. THE BLUE MOUNTAINS; OR, THE FAR. PART I. 1. When little kings, whose race was run A little while ago, Had little thrones to sit upon, And little else to do, Within a little town, remote From Europe's larger scenes, There dwelt a man of little, Who lived on little means. 2. A man, he was, of humble birth and mind, His life was lowly, small was his estate. Yet was there ever a human life confined In bounds so narrow by ungenerous fate, But it had in it something far and strange? This man, from youth to age, had lived and grown In a great longing for a far blue range Of hills that hover'd o'er his native town. Ne'er had his footsteps climb'd those mountains blue, But half his life, and all his thoughts, dwelt there. He was a man beyond himself. They drew His being out of him, and made it fair. For wheresoe'er his gaze around him roved, There were those beautiful blue hills. And he, Who lived, not in himself, but them, so loved And so revered them, that they ceased to be To him mere hills, mere human feet may wend. Their azure summits, to his longing view, Were features of a dear, though distant friend, In kingly coronal and mantle blue. 3. And “Oh,” he mused, “full sure am I Those mountains feel, in silent joy, The love my gaze doth give them. They Seek it, indeed, with signs all day; Down drawing o'er their shoulders fair, This way and that, soft veils of air, And colours, never twice the same, Woven of wind, and dew, and flame, And strange cloud-shadows, and slant showers. “That is their speech. 'Tis unlike ours, Easy to learn, tho', if one tries; One only has to use his eyes. The colours are the vowels. These Are liquid links whose mobile ease Such fluent combination grants To those substantial consonants, Precipitous crags, and sudden peaks. The accents are the lightning-streaks And thunder-claps, that render, each, Such emphasis to mountain speech. Next follow fog and mist, which are Verbs we may call irregular; Perplexing when at first you view them, But persevere, and you'll get thro' them. Then comes the rain, which just supplies The necessary quantities Of notes of admiration. Far Too many, folks may think they are. But if such folks could understand The mountains, there on every hand They'd find about them more, far more, Than notes of admiration, score On score, suffice for. Think, what lands And peoples every peak commands! Then find the statesman that knows how To govern one land. As for two, That task's beyond the best, we feel. Now, had we, like the hills, to deal With winds, and storms, and clouds, and snows, Nor lose our dignified repose, Who'd wonder why the hills abound In thoughts so serious, so profound, About what men, when met together, Talk, without thinking, of—the weather? But still to talk it is men's wont, Both when they think and when they don't. Ah, good old hills! If Majesty Should, some day hence, be forced to fly From all her other thrones on earth, 'Tis there, with you, who gave her birth, That she her latest home would find, Above, but still among, mankind!” PART II. 1. Thus ever the fancies of the man (Like their own restless rills) Upon the mighty mountains ran, Refresht by far-off hills. Not one of his neighbours, he could swear, Half so well as those mountains, knew him, Who wrapp'd his soul in their robe of blue. And, if that were fancy, this was true: That, whether or not, those mountains fair For the good of this man had a thought or care, Much good they had contrived to do him By simply being there. 2. His only wish was to tell them of it, And requite them for it. But not, as now, When to every peak, with the snow above it, And the azure of heaven above the snow, It was only his wishes that found their way; But among the hills, himself, some day Before he died, if that might be, When the hills could hear what he had to say, And how much to say to the hills had he! 3. O heavenly power of human wishes! For as wings to birds, and as fins to fishes, Are a man's desires to the soul of a man. 'Tis by these, and by these alone, it can Wander at will thro' its native sphere Where the beauty that's far is the bliss that is near. Fate favour'd the wishes of this poor man. For the wave of the ebbing century ran In a sudden surge of storm at last Over the little spot of earth, Where, else, unnoticed he might have past To his obscure death from his obscure birth. And thus he, whose life had lain out of sight, A social nothing, the strain and swell Of the time's strong trouble swept into light, And suddenly made perceptible. Then, as soon as noticed by those in power, The man was honour'd (O happy hour!) By the sight of his name in a Royal Decree; Which inform'd the world that he (poor he! Who could have fancied so strange a thing?) Had really and truly lived to be A cause of alarm to his lord the King. For it banish'd him to a place, he knew Must be in the midst of those mountains blue. And thus his wishes, at last, came true. PART III. 1. Glad was our friend, when himself he found, In travelling trim, to the mountains bound! The way was long, and the road was steep, And, before he had got to his journey's end, The night was dark, and the hills asleep. “Aha!” thought he, “will they know their friend, Who is here at last? Too late to-night To see them, of course! They are sleeping now. But to-morrow, to-morrow at earliest light, I shall arise ere the red cock crow, And visit mine old friends, every one.” 2. So, at dawn, he arose with the rising sun, And forth, as blithe as a bird, went he. At first he was puzzled and pain'd, to find All round him a field which appear'd to be Just like the fields he had left behind: A little meadow of grass, hemm'd round With many a little hillock and mound, Which hinder'd his sight from ranging far. “But soon are these small hills climb'd,” he thought, “And behind them, doubtless, the blue ones are, Where, sportively hiding, they wish to be caught.” 3. Then he mounted the hillocks that rose close by, And thence, indeed, he beheld once more The old blue hills. But they were not nigh; They were far, far, far away, as before. 4. “Strange!” he mused, “yet I travell'd all day, Ay, and more than the half o' the night, too, post! And all my life I have heard folks say That the blue hills are but a day, at most, From my native town. Did they err, I wonder?” Then, he ask'd of a traveller passing by, “Pray, sir, what is that country yonder? There, where the hills are so blue and high.” And, when the traveller had told him the name Of the place where the blue hills now were seen, Alas, poor man! 'twas the very same Where, till then, he had all his life long been: The country about his native town— His birthplace—whence he had just been banish'd. The blue hills there he had never known, And the blue hills here, which he loved, had vanish'd. PART IV. 1. “And have I been living, then, all this while In a blue land—really and truly blue?” The exile sigh'd with a sorrowful smile, “And never dream'd of it? Can it be true? Never dream'd of it! All seem'd grey, Or dusty white, with a patch or two Of lean green grass, or raw red clay, To enliven the rest. But blue?. . . blue?. . . blue?” 2. And the man fell into a reverie. O'er his cerulean home a brood Of etherial clouds was floating free. And they sign'd to him, and he understood. 3. “As the waves that are clad in the azure of ocean, So clad in the azure of heaven are we. As thou movest, we move, with an unseen motion; And, where thou followest, there we flee. For the children of Never and Ever we are, And our home is Beyond, and our name is Afar. “Never to us shall thy steps attain, Nor ever to thee may we draw nearer. But, if fair in thy vision our forms remain, Still love us, the farther we are, the dearer, And be thou ours, as thine we are, For what were the near, were it not for the far? “Look above, and below—to the heaven, the plain! The low and the level, they disappear. The aloof and the lofty alone remain. And, for ever present tho' never near, Whilst ours are the summit, the sky, and the star, Still thine is the beauty of all that we are.” 4. All this, in his much-loved mountain-tongue, The man's heart, hearing it, understood. And he thought of the old old days, so young! But he spake not: only, let fall a flood Of passionate notes of admiration, Over his wan cheek silently sweeping. As when, in their sorrow and desolation, At the death of the summer, the hills are weeping. 5. Then the folk about him, who knew not aught Of that mountain language, shook the head. “How he taketh his sentence to heart!” each thought. And “Courage! the times must mend,” they said. VIII. A WHEAT-STALK; OR, THE NEAR. I. The cattle tinkle down the lanes, And there the bramble roses blow. From rocky haunts to reach the plains The rills, with shaken timbrel, go, Gay dancers light! The hills are bright With gleaming peaks of golden snow. By fragrant gales in frolic play The floating corn's green waves are fann'd, And all above, broad summer day! And all below, bright summer land! And, born of each, Far out of reach, Those shining alpine spectres stand. II. A world of beauty, grandeur, grace, Abundance, fill'd with force divine, No sooner doth mine eye embrace Than my soul hath made it mine. How deep, O soul, Thy depth must be, To hold the whole Of a world in thee! III. But O eye, and O soul, is your thirst yet sated? Or what more do ye claim for your own? Must this world, at the best, be so lightly rated, For the sake of a better, unknown? Ah, farther away than the farthest hill-top Do I feel mine own boundless emotion! And my heart, tho' o'erbrimm'd it may be by a drop, Is contented not with an ocean. IV. On the blossomy lattice ledge, Whence, far away, I descry The long land's light blue edge, With beyond it only the sky, From a glass half fill'd with water Leans an ear of wheat. 'Tis a prize Which erewhile my little daughter Brought hither with brighten'd eyes. Its stem, when she pluck'd it, stood An inch higher than she could see. And the wheat-field to her was a wood, And this wheaten stalk was a tree. And, as soon as her gift my fairy Had deign'd to confer upon me, With a frolicsome footstep airy, Off, carolling, gamboll'd she. V. A little child, scarce five years old, And blithe as bird on bough; A little maiden, bright as gold, And pure as new-fall'n snow. Things seen, to her, are things unknown: Things near are far away: The neighbouring hamlet, next our own, As distant as Cathay! Far things, which we nor feel, nor see, To her seem close and clear. In yon blue sky God's guardian eye She feels, and feels it near. What need hath she, our world should be So wondrous wide and far? Such worlds unknown are all her own, And every world a star! VI. Why, dreaming ever, clings my gaze so fast To this small wheat-stem? Whence its power to draw My refluent thoughts from yonder distance vast, And hang them on a homely wheaten straw? It is that, small and homely though it be, This ear of wheat so homely and so small, Because it is so near, so near to me, Hath size enough and power to cover all. It leans along full twenty leagues of land, And hides them with a straw. The purple hills Peer through its hoary panicle. The grand Horizon's azure orb one wheat-stem fills. Kindly perspective! Little things close by Exceed great things remote: for Nature's art Brings vision to a centre in the eye, Affection to a centre in the heart. And, were it not so, light and love would be Lost wanderers; and the universal frame A heap of fragments; and the force to see, The force to feel, mere force without an aim. VII. O near ones, dear ones! you, in whose right hands Our own rests calm; whose faithful hearts all day Wide open wait till back from distant lands Thought, the tired traveller, wends his homeward way! Helpmates and hearthmates, gladdeners of gone years, Tender companions of our serious days, Who colour with your kisses, smiles, and tears Life's warm web woven over wonted ways, Young children, and old neighbours, and old friends, Old servants—you, whose smiling circle small Grows slowly smaller till at last it ends Where in one grave is room enough for all, O shut the world out from the heart you cheer! Tho' small the circle of your smiles may be, The world is distant, and your smiles are near. This makes you more than all the world to me. IX. THE ASS AND THE WAGTAIL. 1. The ass began to bray. All who heard him, by the voice of him affrighted, Cried “How horrible!” and turn'd their heads away. 2. The sun began to shine. All who felt him, by the beam of him delighted, Looking up to him, cried fervently, “How fine!” 3. An ass his feelings has. And the feelings of this ass, alas! Were wounded. He said, tossing his head, (And the scorn his speech betray'd, loud bray'd, Resounded) “Hee! haw! Lighter than straw On the wind, fools run After what glitters. The taste of the day! Sound worth they shun, Their praises give to the sun's display, And to me give none. Ungrateful and frivolous fools, I say! For, if I were the sun, they would flatter me, they Who all fly me now. Yet, if I were the sun, What could I do for them more, I pray, Than, being an ass, I already have done? I should simply have nothing to do but to shine— Shine, or be seen, 'twould be all as one: And no great merit in that, I opine, If one happens to be the sun.” 4. A wagtail nodded his head. The ass was pleased. “It is plain Thou hast understood me,” he said. The wagtail nodded again. 5. “And my voice hath a charm for thee?” More movements of affirmation. “Sage bird! I see we agree.” (Much encouraged, continued he) “What senseless exaggeration In this praise of the sun! Nay, nay, I am not unjust, I trust. I admire, and enjoy, in its way, (Tho' the end of it all is dust) The sun's superficial display, —When there's shadow elsewhere in store. For what is light without shadow? And the sun hath no shadow at all. When he sprawls all ablaze on the meadow, One is driven for shade to the wall. Now, that is the fault I deplore. True art enjoins exclusion; What artists call ‘the file.’ Superabundant diffusion Is the vice of a vulgar style. The rich are prodigal rarely. There's some fire in the sun, no doubt. But of art . . . well, seeking it fairly, Not a symptom can I find out. If the least little leaflet green Chance to cover the finest peach, He passes it by unseen, As tho' it were miles out of reach. Many a statue fair Of marble god and goddess, Perfectly Greek, and bare Of even a bit of a boddice, He leaves in the damp and cold Of their grottoes, and groves, and springs, To gild, in the dust, with his gold, The commonest insect things. Is that worthy work (now own!) For a star to whom it is given To saunter all day up and down, Staring about him, in heaven? Look at me, little bird! I am far From comparing my humble powers With those of that profligate star. But, to perfect them, all the twelve hours I've a practical occupation. Without it, I care not a whit For brilliant imagination. And I value not genius or wit, If it lacks the elaboration, The earnest moral tone, And genuine consecration Of work—work, steadily done. 'Tis with pride that I bear up and down Sacks of corn to the mill, And sacks of flour to the town. For, whilst useful to others, I still Feel that fairly and fully mine own Is the honour on me conferr'd Of the right to be thus employ'd. 'Tis a privilege, little bird, By the idle never enjoy'd.” 6. At every boastful word The ass thus solemnly said, As tho' in its truth he concurr'd, The wagtail nodded his head. 7. And the ass resumed. “No doubt, The fat paddock is not for me. The spruce garden where cabbages sprout, 'Tis but over the wall I see. From the corn-bin I get not a bite: To the pampering oat I'm a stranger, And the fragrant hay is quite Out of reach of my modest manger. But of no such dainties I dream. The thistle, that hardy relation Of the sickly artichoke, I have learn'd to know and esteem, And I relish my well-earn'd ration, Not envying sumptuous folk. Then, is it not hard, I ask, When my voice I raise In vigorous lays of praise, To celebrate Virtue's task, And her days Well spent,—yon fools, who bask In the sun's mere casual rays, All stop their ears with a cry, and fly My discourse at the very first minute, Nay, almost before I begin it, As if the devil were in it? Why do they do that, why?” 8. Had this worthy ass been content With the wagtail's tacit assent, We should never have known, alas! What a wagtail thinks of an ass. 9. But he, Impatient, as well he might be, After so long saying his say, Of getting to all that he said The self-same nod of the head In for ever the self-same way, Began to demand of his auditor An opinion more in detail Concerning the cause he was pleading for. Then, the wagtail hopp'd from his rail, And hopp'd on to a stone, that stood Half out of the brooklet's bed, And replied, “Not a word have I understood Of all that you just now said.” 10. “Not a word?” exclaim'd the ass, much surprised, “Not a word of all I said and all I meant? And yet, surely, if an ass may trust his eyes, To each word of it you nodded me assent.” 11. “Nodded,” said the wagtail, “ay! But nodded you assent, friend, nay! If I nodded 'twas because it is my way, And because I am a wagtail, I. So the sun shines, yonder, up on high, Just because he is the sun. And so you, too, as you say, Fetch and carry sacks all day, Getting thanks for it from none, Just because you are an ass.” 12. Then the wagtail flew away, Thro' the trees, across the grass. And this fable is done. X. THE MISANTHROPE AND THE BIRD. One more Alceste, by all the world betray'd, And overburden'd with unnumber'd wrongs, The victor vices in their hell-pit leaving, Sought out on earth some solitary spot For honourable freedom. Scorn of men Forth drave him, and desire of desertness, And deep disgust of affectations fed On fool'd affections, with a sudden force Hither and thither, till he found at last A tract of savage, strange, uncitied land, Forgotten like himself. There settled he; Far from each false Philinthe and Celimène, And “love unruled by reason,” and the troop Of those “great makers of great protestations” The world calls friends. This hater of mankind Walking alone along the windy wold One morning, spied a falcon in the wind, That chased a skylark. And the skylark fled For shelter to the bosom of the man. Who, muttering “Miserable little bird, I give thee what to me none ever gave,” His cloak unclasp'd, and to the bird vouchsafed Welcome in woe and shelter from distress. Then built a bowery cage; where for a while, With all, save freedom, that a bird can want, The skylark, seeming well contented, lived. Was it the memory of a peril past, That made the sense of present safety sweet? Or gratitude for benefits received? Or but the waning charm of change? Alceste, Tho' disbelieving human kindness still, And earthly blessedness still disbelieving, Believed, at least, that he had blest this bird With so much bliss as he by that belief Still made his own, because he was a man. So lapsed the season. Longer wax'd the days And the nights warmer: till a tremor ran, Preluding the revival of the year, Along the leafless boughs. And, ere it pass'd, Lo you! like love, that changes life, all round, Above, beneath, the Spring was everywhere; Troubling the sleep of Nature with mad hopes. All things of joy and beauty, long represt, Broke out in revel, riotously sure Of May's delirious promise. From whose mirth, Pelted with buds, the frowning Winter wrapp'd His white robe round him, like a minister Disgraced, that from the uprisen people runs, And fled, barefooted; muttering “Motley fools, That fling a saucy triumph in the face Of fleeting Power, sing! dance! pavilion all The tipsy tops of yonder swaggering trees With tassell'd fringe! on every wanton puff Of passing wind swing out your banners blithe! Carpet with squander'd broidery, green and gold, The dull land deckt for your audacious march! Break ope earth's hidden treasures! 'twirl and toss Your silly tinkling timbrels that proclaim A world's subversion! Fools, I shall return.” Then, for the skies the skylark yearn'd: and, mad With memories which the magic of the Spring Had changed to hopes, he could no comfort find In any corner of his corbell'd cage. But, food by day and sleep by night refusing, He sent forth little plaintive cries, and beat With petulant beak and breast the ozier bars Of his unvalued lattice. This, Alceste Beheld, compassionately vext; and sigh'd “Thou longest for lost liberty, alas! The snares of earth, the storms of heaven forgetting, The chill wind chattering on the rainy wold, And the hawk hovering in blue ambush high. A wandering odour on the wakeful night, A warmer breeze thro' budded thickets breaking, Suffice thee to efface all sufferings past, Insensate! and thou flutterest to regain Thy persecuting freedom. Out on time! Doth Memory carve the records of Mischance With such a careless or a clumsy hand That, ere the lazy creeping ivy-twine Hath time to lace her latest epitaph, It fades away? Ah, were her warning words But graved on granite, the insensible stone Would keep unblunted all their biting truths: But she confides them to the tender stuff That hearts are made of; and the hot blood there, Born for betrayal, heals old hurts in haste, Lest the scarr'd nerve, grown callous, miss the smart Of sufferings yet in store. Go, silly bird! Thou know'st not how that folk, self-styled elect, Which deem'd itself Heaven's favourite upon earth, Tho' in the desert half a hundred years It linger'd looking for the Promised Land, Is at this hour a wanderer as of old, The byword of the nations! Get thee gone, Truster in promises!” He oped the cage, And forth, in vain admonisht, flew the bird. Some few days after, near the self-same spot Where, in the autumn of the bygone year Alceste had saved it from its falcon foe, He found the skylark dead. Desuëtude Of self-exertion, caused by comfort got Without an effort, had relax'd the strength, And dull'd the craft, which Freedom needs to bear The bruising buffets of Necessity. Unshelter'd cold and foodless hunger found No friend in liberty. A little heap Of frozen feathers in the mountain grass Was all that rested of a vain desire Wreckt on a sea of promise. Seeing this, “Heart-breaking Liberty!” Alceste exclaim'd, “If we be strong, with stronger than ourselves Thou dost confront us: and, if weak we be, In vain thy gifts thou givest us. Yet ah, Safe-shelter'd from thy harsh embrace, we droop, And find no joy wherever thou art not.” XI. FORTUNE AND HER FOLLOWERS. PART I. Two friends in search of Fortune once set out Together. And, for many and many a day, Up hill, down dale, and all the land about, Ever in search of Fortune wander'd they, Till both were tired. Then one sat down, and sigh'd, “Of finding Fortune I begin to doubt, And fear we may have taken the wrong way. How say you, friend?” The other one replied, “It seems, indeed, that we have gone astray, For here of Fortune is no trace, in truth. But there stands one, may haply tell us yet Which side to turn. Look yonder!” 'Twas a youth Who in the crossway stood where two roads met, And by the bridle held in either hand A horse. Himself was looking eagerly To right and left, both ways across the land, And seem'd to wait for some one. “Holla, boy! Hast seen Dame Fortune pass this way?” “'Twas she That bade me here remain (for my employ Is to obey her) until I should see Two travellers coming, who would ask for her. And, by the question ye have asked of me, My charge, I doubt not, doth to you refer. To whom, as soon as seen, her orders were That I should give these steeds, which saddled be For you to mount. One steed to each.”—“O rare Good Fortune!” cried the grateful twain. “Say how May we our benefactress find? and where?” “Nay,” said the lad, “that's more, sirs, than I know. She bade me say her way lies here and there, And it is yours to find her.” Now, the two (Because they could not both together fare By different ways, and had no indication On which side Fortune waited) thereupon Reluctantly resolved on separation, Each following Fortune his own way, alone. For at the point where they took horse, the road Split into two, which from the self-same spot Led right and left; and not a sign-post show'd Which was the road to Fortune, which was not. PART II. The first of the twain then gallop'd amain Till he came to the nearest town. And there he was fain to throw up the rein At the first inn door, and get down. For his horse was tired; as he was, too; And of rest and food they were both in need, Ere they could their journey again pursue. So there they waited to rest and feed. But, when horse and man had their strength renew'd, They started again, and again pursued The chase; tho' in vain; for thus ever again, As from city to city they journey'd fast, With each fresh fatigue there was need, for the twain, Of a fresh repose and a fresh repast; Till the horse fell lame of a double sprain, And the man had no money left at last. To prison he must have gone, no doubt, If his host (surmising he might do worse, When the man had his reckoning all run out) Had not taken in payment the founder'd horse. “Ah, scurvy Fortune!” the traveller said, “This is what comes at the last, I see,” (And the poor wretch ruefully shook his head) “Of running about in search of thee. Here am I, ruin'd, and half-starved dead! And what is henceforth to become of me?” The host heard this, and “Both board and bed You may earn, if you will. Rest here,” said he. “Who works for his bread hath a right to be fed. And that's better than starving, or stealing, at least. Take service with me. And endeavour to be Of some use now to this broken-down beast You have used so ill.” Tho' it be but stale, Sweeter, no doubt, than the bread of the jail Is the bread that is earn'd. To his evil case Our traveller had no choice but submit With a grieving heart and a grateful face, And, bitterly earning his daily bit Of bread, and his nightly truss of straw (For the moneyless man must work, if he can, And to jail, if he can't, and that is the law) The master-turn'd-servant now served, alas, The brute that had brought him to this sad pass. PART III. Time fled. To the door of that inn one day, Came, at nightfall, a carriage with horses four. Wealthy and healthy, good-humour'd and gay, Did its occupant look. Never counting the score, For his supper he order'd the choicest and best That mine host could procure for so noble a guest; And, as soon as the landlord had shown him his room, Enquired if he happen'd to know of a lad He could recommend as a stable groom. Said mine host, “Tho' to lose him, your worship, I'm sad, There's a poor fellow here I can well recommend.” Then for Fortune's unfortunate follower (glad To get rid of him thus) the rogue hasten'd to send. For he thought to himself “What a lucky chance, To oblige a man of such station By the much-desired deliverance From that beggar's prolong'd starvation!” But fancy the face of the rascal, when To his wonder he witness'd those two men (His great rich guest and his stable boy) With a cry of recognition and joy Rush into the arms of one another, As the first exclaim'd, “O friend! O brother! Have I found thee at last? I have sought thee long. And how changed, dear friend! Hast thou suffer'd wrong?” Mine host would have spoken. But here the door Was shut in his face, and he heard no more. PART IV. What he might have heard, had his wealthy guest Not lock'd him out that he should not hear, Was (after the poor man's joy was express'd At tasting once more in his life good cheer, And feeling his hand by a good friend press'd) The admiring question, “But tell me, pray, Since you have discover'd it, favour'd one, The way to Fortune.” “I know no way” The other replied, “tho' to Fortune alone, My wealth I owe.” “By what lucky chance? A lottery?—or an inheritance?” “The latter. That horse which she gave me Is dead long since, and I am his heir.” “The heir of a horse, friend? How can that be? The same, to look at, our two steeds were. Mine's now but a damaged beast, as you see. How happens it yours was a millionaire?” “Listen. I gallop'd at first, like you; But, perceiving, after a day or two, That I lost my labour, and, what was worse, Without filling my belly had emptied my purse, I began to consider the shortest way Of simply getting from day to day. Now, for this mine own two legs would do Just as well as my horse's four; and so ‘I'll kill him,’ I thought, ‘and the skin of the beast Will make me, to still jog on, at least A dozen stout pairs of shoes; and they Will cost me nothing for corn or hay?’ So said, so done. My horse I slew. His flesh for meat to the butcher I sold, And his tail to a Pacha who, having but two, Had set his heart on a third. With the gold Which I got thereby, a barrow I bought To carry my merchandise about. For out of the hide of my horse I had wrought More shoes than I needed, and all were stout. These others I sold, and increased my store. And when my stock of leather was out, As the folk were still eager to purchase more, Said I again to myself, ‘No doubt It were better for me, so long as my door The people with purse in hand importune, Daily to purchase my wares by the score, If, instead of still running after Fortune, And so wearing mine own shoes into holes, I stay where I am, and provide stout soles For the feet of the fools who to find her fare By all manner of ways, a motley host. Since founder'd horses are not so rare But what I may get them at no great cost.’ It is thus that at last, having beaten dead, Without riding one of them, horse upon horse, I find myself where I am, at the head Of a flourishing business. Leather, of course. So, in search of Fortune not needing to spend My days as of old, when we sought her together, I set out, as you see, to seek after my friend. And, not having lost anything, even leather, Both the one and the other I now find mine. So here's to Fortune! and pass me the wine. For what's mine is yours: and we'll share it now, Old friend, as to seek it of yore we toil'd Side by side.” Then the poor man cried, As his lean cheek flush'd with a grateful glow, “I thank thee, Fortune! for now I see That the best of thy gifts thou hast saved for me, A friend whom thy favours have not spoil'd!” EPILOGUE (INSTEAD OF A MORAL), The Fabulist's a pedant, whose profession Is, with the plainest most precise expression, To preach in all ways, unto all mankind, “Be wise, and good!” Well for him, if we find Those speaking contrasts in his text, which spare The preacher's pains, and of themselves declare The preacher's purpose! Well, if, on his way, One with its load, the other with its lay, Emmet and grasshopper do chance to pass, Or royal lion and ridiculous ass, Or crafty fox and over-credulous crow! For contrasts, clear as these, have but to show Their faces to us; and, as soon as seen, All's understood. Moreover, men, I ween, Without resentment, nay, with laughter glad, First see their foibles when they see them clad In fur and feathers, or in hoof and hide. But ah! not always doth kind Chance provide Such fortunate occurrences to him Who pries not only into corners dim For secret treasures, but in field and street Questions whatever he may chance to meet; And often for an answer waits in vain, Or gets one he is puzzled to explain. So aid me, Gentle Reader! Staff in hand, And nose in air, I roam thro' Fable Land; And sniff the passing wind, and tap the ground, Ready to seize on all that's to be found; Keen as a sportsman who, with bag and gun, In search of game goes beating, one by one, The bushes all. My prey escapes me not. But this time there falls only to my shot A moral tale—too moral thro' and thro' It may be, for a moral tail thereto. Naught do I scorn, but all that comes I greet. And, even as swallows, when the air is sweet, And Spring's abroad, flit swiftly to and fro, Come and then vanish ere a man cries “lo!” So flit these fables, a wing-woven mist, Before the fancy of the fabulist. This came, as came the others; on light wing Swiftly appearing, swiftly vanishing, 'Twixt two unknowns. I caught it as it past. “O swallow, swallow, since I hold thee fast, Tell me thy secret ere I let thee go!” Thus ever hath it been my wont to do With these light-wingèd visitants from far, And sometimes long delay'd their answers are. But this was in a hurry to be gone, And answer'd quickly, “Secret have I none. What can I tell thee which thou dost not see? Two wings hath Fortune also given to me, Which now are fluttering to be far away. Loose me, and let me use them while I may!” Surprised, I loosed the bird. Away it flew. And with it fled away the moral too: Dropping this counsel, as I watch'd it flit Like Fortune's self—not to run after it. XII. COMPOSURE. 1 Seaward from east to west a river roll'd, Majestic as the sun whose course it follow'd, Filling with liquid quiet of clear cold The depths its husht waves hollow'd. 2 No wrinkle ruffled that serene expanse; Till, percht atiptoe on its placid path, A tiny rock the surface pierced by chance, Whereat it foam'd with wrath. 3 Over the depths, indifferent, smooth of pace, The current with continuous calm had crost. Yet lo, a little pinscratch in the face, All its repose was lost! XIII. SIC ITUR. 1. Behold yon sleep-soft phantom opaline (That seems “such stuff as dreams are made of”) rise And wane, as dreams do from awakening eyne, Above the woodman's hut. Like one that tries Uncertain paths, from prison precincts flying, The frighten'd spectre pauses, turns, and stoops; Confused, unused to freedom; faint, fast dying. The breath of liberty descends on it Fierce as a brigand from his ambush swoops, And, cowering, see the brow-beat craven flit Along the tops of the tumultuous trees! There, pallid patches of its shroud, all torn, Float, feebly tossing on the fitful breeze That heaves about these forest haunts forlorn, And with low mocking laughter murmurs “Lost!” As fades in film the desultory smoke. But would ye learn what life hath lived this ghost? Listen! for now the wind is in the oak, Its weary chronicler. 2. But yesterday 'Twas the fairest child of the Forest green, From whose waving arms she now wanes away, A bodiless goblin. Safe, unseen, The sleek-limb'd hart in his slumber lay At the foot of her, gladden'd with grassy shade When the glaring wave of the noon wash'd clean All shadow away from the open glade. And the birds, that had dream'd in the far-off lands Of a life to be lived in her leafy boughs, And had travell'd by night in seafaring bands Over the ocean to meet and carouse Here in their fair predestined home, Blithe music made from her dancing dome. And the squirrel, that bird who, instead of wings, Hath a spirit within him that soars and springs, Set her fluttering spray in a tremble sweet As the tender tremour that mounts and moves Through the limbs of a maiden whose pulses beat 'Neath the first light touch of a hand she loves. And the wind, that gossip so indiscreet (The confidant of the unconfiding) Ever at eve, when the high day's heat Was calm'd and cool'd, thro' her branches gliding, Whisper'd low to the listening wood Secrets, echo'd from tree to tree, Yet by none of his listeners understood; For the pleasure alone, as it seem'd to be, Of betraying the trust received from many, Without wrong done to the faith of any. 3. Art thou weary of wandering About a noisy world alone? With plumage soil'd and broken wing Fly to the Forest, weary one! For there is the City of Refuge fair, Where Silence and Repose, Two lovers banisht the earth elsewhere, Dwell safe from a world of foes. But unloved was the Forest's restful lot By the Forest's child who had wander'd not. The far-off clouds as they wander'd by She watch'd, and felt with a wishful sigh, “I would that a wandering cloud were I! To follow the sun o'er the azure deep, And catch the last kiss of the dying day, And bear in my bosom the moon asleep! With the winds of summer to sport and play, With the snows of winter from steep to steep, Wrapt in a mystical mantle grey, To mount, and pause o'er the world, and peep At my pictured self in the pools, and stray Over wide waters and over broad downs, Windy sea-beaches and turreted towns, Clothing myself in all hues that be, And taking all forms that seem fair to me; To dream, and create what I dream of, too; Float, a white feather thro' fathomless blue; Fly, a wing'd dragon, with plumage of flame Lurid and purple, strange news to proclaim Of the Storm that is plotting to levy wild war On the pines, whose tall people his progress bar. Then bathe, a bright naiad, at eve, bosom bare, All rosy with rapture, in wells of warm air By the waves of the sunset bequeath'd as they sink, For the baths of my beauty, on Ocean's brink; And thro' moonlight and midnight to melt out of sight In the depths of the heavens like a dream of delight! Ah! dream of delight that dissolves even now! For, fasten'd here to the earth below, My fingers clutch but the sordid ground To whose chill lap is my sad life bound. Lost in the crowd of my neighbours, far Lonelier thus than the lonely are! Divining all, and beholding naught Save that which escapeth as soon as sought; Seeing only the clouds sail by, Hearing only the stray winds sigh, Embracing those that, embraced in vain, With a careless chirrup depart again. Wretchedest life! ah, when will it end?” 4. It ended then. Death came to befriend Life's longings. A stroke of the hatchet . . . one— Two—three . . . and that unloved life was done. With a sigh, then a groan, did the tree sink down, Beating the air with her branches. Blown About her, leaflets like drops of blood Sprinkled the sod. On the torn soil stood But a stump deform'd, like a block that awaits Some victim dragg'd from his dungeon gates There to perish. Nought else remain'd Of the life that had been by itself disdain'd. 5. Woodsmen and headsmen—doomsmen all— Are quick at their work. 'Tis a word and a blow. And that word is a word by the axe let fall, Stopping life's prate. For from ages ago Between iron and life is a rancour old, And the iron emergeth again and again From the earth's black bowels, his birthplace cold, Only to bite, and shed blood, or give pain. 6. What did the woodmen want? No more Than fuel to boil their broth. Not so The iron, whose rancorous soul was sore For the want of a victim to fell and lay low. And for ever, as long as the years roll by, Shall such fellowships in another's woe (The alliance of Spite with Stupidity) Be able, as this was, to overthrow Something beautiful, something high, Or something that sought to be both, And seem'd born for a fairer fate Than to boil Vulgarity's daily broth On the fire that is fuell'd by Hate. 7. The Tree to the clouds did aspire: The Axe for destruction panted: The Woodmen wanted to fuel their fire: And they all of them have what they wanted. 8. In ghastly cloud the ghost of the dead tree, Finding an issue from the roof, arose And, o'er its native forest floating free, Beheld that ancient City of Repose Where it had lived and dream'd. Accomplisht now Both dream and life! It knew itself a cloud. Fain to its former brotherhood below It would have whisper'd from its phantom shroud What phantoms feel, and only phantoms know. But their yet green and living leaves grew grey, Paled by its spectral presence as it pass'd, And shuddering shrank. Slowly it waned away Into the void, invisible at last! Yet scattering, as it faded, downward flakes Of sullen soot that o'er the forest fell Like lost illusions on a heart that aches When Hope departs and Memory sighs farewell. 9. Follow, O follow with regretful gaze Those waning orbs that float and fade between The earth and heaven, i' the void where nothing stays, Clouding heaven's azure, shadowing earth's green! Desires disbodied. Phantoms. Promises, Fraudulent promises which Life hath given And Death pretends to keep. Souls of dead days, Hopes of lost hours: that fade 'twixt earth and heaven! We rake the ashes that you leave behind, The sole realities that rest of you, And there still beggar'd Memory seeks to find The gold false Hope to feed his sorceries threw. But even these, some day, the hankering wind Will scatter in the void, between the blue We take for heaven, the green that once was earth. Death's silent answers to the cries of birth! XIV. DIOGENES OR ALEXANDER? 1. Bohemian born, but by laborious art To perfect polish smooth'd in every part, And form'd to shine with frigid grace, acquired From that hard lucid style that's most admired, A Water-Bottle of the last design Glitter'd among the flowers and dishes fine That brightly blush'd and proudly beam'd upon The festive board of some Amphitrion. 2. New to the place, he gazed in pure delight All round the snowy Saxon damask, bright With golden garniture, and florid piles, And porcelain shepherds peeping with pert smiles From Arcadies of Sevres. Flatter'd pride Beam'd out of all his features, as he sigh'd “O Form! Form! thou art everything! Nor yet (Beam-bathed and glory-girt) can I regret That long, laborious, painful preparation Which form'd me fit for this exalted station. Yes, Form is everything. Severe and hard Its acquisition: but what rare reward Awaits the acquirer! Common flint was I, Who, thanks to Form, now glitter radiantly As any gem. O triumph! not in vain (Per aspera ad astra!) was the pain That polish'd, point by point, and line by line, This well-consider'd perfect form of mine!” 3. But, whilst he mused self-laudatory thus, Ye gods! what sudden object scandalous And sinister confronts his casual glance? A valet pour'd the sparkling wine of France: And in the bottle, gross, ungainly, black, From which it foam'd he recognised alack, A long-forgotten cousin. Sore distrest For fear this low connection should be guess'd, The delicate Decanter sigh'd aghast, “How hath that blackguard turn'd up here at last? Whence comes he? Talk of Form, indeed! O fie, The clumsy sloven! what vulgarity! He hath not even wash'd his face, I'll swear, Nor brush'd his coat. 'Tis cobwebb'd. What an air Of back-slum unacknowledgeable life!” 4. If one had struck him with a carving-knife, No greater shock could have been dealt thereby To that fine sense of strict propriety Which made our poor friend, even when in a passion, The mould of Form and water-glass of Fashion. Still greater wax'd the wonder of it all, When neither host nor guests one word let fall Of passing reprobation or disgust, As more such shabby upstarts forward thrust Their necks, and spouted. To a pitch it grew When, after each had pour'd libations new, In ladies' eyes a deeper starlight danced, More briskly round the rippling converse glanced, Or sparkled off in spray of laughter light, The wise grown witty, and the dull grown bright. And, when at last the spritely feast was done, And from the board its merry guests all gone, (The portly Banker-Prince; the last Prose-Poet, New to the world though he profess'd to know it; The Wit, who had out-dined a generation Of other wits, who dined for reputation; The famous Traveller, fresh from Timbuctoo; The last survivor left of Waterloo; The year's five Beauties, each in rival trim) Not one of all of them had noticed him, Tho' keen observers were they, all and each. 5. Left to himself (as on a desert beach A limpet by an ebb'd-out tide) among The silent sideboard's stationary throng Of glassy things, he spied an old Carafe; Crackt, and so out of service; but still safe From the sad fate of commoner crackt glass, Since sole survivor of a set that was Beauteous and precious in its time, tho' now No more the fashion. And, relating how His feelings had been shockt, “Dear Madam, deign,” Said he, “this contradiction to explain.” 6. “Alas!” the Old Beauty answer'd with a sigh, “Young friend, none better can do that than I. O pleasant petits soupers of the past! Wild, wicked, witty evenings, gone so fast! How unremember'd are their mirth and grace! 'Twas there the rogue was in his natural place, Whose presence disconcerted you to-night. 'Twas there he reign'd, the soul of all delight All laughter. Ah, and those fair dames were sly! We pour'd them out our pure propriety In vain. For form's sake, they vouchsafed three sips, Returning ever with their pretty lips To his pert fountain. Ay, and then, O child, What fun, what frolic, what adventures wild, What scandals I have seen, and I could tell! And all this rascal's doing. Well, child, well, Give him his due. I said, and still I say, The rogue's a rogue, but in a sort of a way There's something good in him.” The old Carafe, Looking like a diaphanous giraffe, (The nec plus ultra of all disproportion 'Twixt neck and body—a sedate distortion) Said this with such an air as ladies old Assume when they break off a tale half told, But leave the purport of it plain enough, Clinching their last word with a pinch of snuff. 7. “But,” said the novice, growing thoughtful, “why, Dear madam, is it, then, that you and I, Whose form is perfect, lack the charm which still With such sweet influence doth inform and fill What flows from him who hath no form at all?” “Hey!” said the old one, “Man is what I call The greatest paradox in all creation, And I can give no other explanation. One thing he thinks, and does another thing: Makes money, saves it, and, when saved, doth fling His money out o' window: ne'er hath found His best friends out till they lay underground: Only consults his health when it is gone: And if he values virtue, I, for one, Believe he does so simply for the sake Of vice, which virtue doth by contrast make More to his taste. For all his folly flows From that one drop of wisdom Heaven bestows In mockery on him for no use at all. He boasts his elevation in his fall; And still, the lower that he lies, the more He deems his natural place was high before. Height measures he by depth, seeks peace in strife, And calls all this the Poetry of Life.” 8. “But,” cried the young one, “what has that to do With our low cousin? and how, even so, Does he contrive to make such a sensation?” “Child, 'tis a sort of natural inspiration Which men, who persecute by turns and pet it, Ignore first, then o'er-rate, and then forget it. 'Tis not worth getting, if it could be got. As, just investigate the woeful lot Of those to whom 'tis given, and you'll find. One bright spark wandering on a midnight wind! Our friend's a being, call him what you will, Of genius; who has simply turn'd out ill, As genius generally does. Do you So envy him? That's more than you would do, Knew you but how, till just an hour before His recent triumph, which so soon was o'er, The poor wretch fared. A dingy outcast he, Who unobserved, till chance his lot set free, Lay dark in silence, solitude, and cold. Such was his past. His future? Oh, soon told! How fares he now? Thro' yonder window peep, You'll see him lying on a loathsome heap Of stable ordures in the base back yard. And if his fall, which must have hurt him hard, Hath not yet shatter'd him, some scavenger, Raking among the unsavoury refuse there In search of fallen and forgotten things, Where blue flies buzz and the rank nettle springs, Will haply filch him from his filthy lair. What next? In some grim garret, Heaven knows where, Methinks I see our miserable friend Serving to hold the bit of candle-end By whose sick, smoky, feeble flame he'll see Some other genius, badly off as he, Pouring on paper the portentous proem Of some sublime unpurchaseable poem. Another kind of wine-flask, full of froth Most evanescent! And the fate of both Is, trust me, miserably much the same. A life's discomfort for a moment's fame! Our lot is better. Not much use are we; But folks, at least respect us—as you see.” 9. The young Decanter mused; nor made reply. Save by an inward meditative sigh; Which we translate, as well as we are able, By the famed query which preludes this fable. XV. A LEGEND. “Die Tugend erwartet ihren Lohn in jener Welt; die Klugheit hofft ihn in dieser; das Genie weder in dieser noch in jener: es ist sein eigner Lohn.” Virtue awaits its reward in the next world; Ability in this: Genius in neither. Genius is its own reward.—Schopenhauer, ii. 260. It was the eve of the day Which for the sake of St Peter Christendom honours: and he, Being the Porter of Heaven, Pray'd St Thomas to take Charge of Heaven's gate for awhile; Since on the morrow himself Needs must be present in Rome, There to receive, and reward, Christendom's praise and its pence. Prudent St Thomas, however, Is the most scrupulous, most Conscientious of saints. Conscientious, because He, the Celestial Empiric, Even in high metaphysics Follows the physical method, Experimental, exact; Judging of things for himself, Never dismissing a doubt Till he hath probed it and proved. Therefore St Thomas refused, Firmly refused, to take charge Of the Celestial Gate, (Lest he should thereby incur Charge, too, of error—the Church Holds for a damnable sin) Save on condition that first Peter should point to him out Whom, without risk of himself Being thereby taken in, He into Heaven might take. Peter, tho' firm as a rock, Knows that a point may be gain'd Best by not arguing it. “What!” he replied, “only that? Good! since you will, be it so! Brother, between you and me, 'Tis but a sinecure. Still, Better prevention than cure. Put on your hat. We have time.” Safe, then, he fasten'd the Gate, Popp'd in his pocket the keys, Hail'd the first cloud that came by, Into it jump'd with St Thomas, And in a trice the Apostles Travell'd together to town. “Now,” said St Peter, “observe! Over their heads who must die Ere the night's done, you'll perceive Trembling a little blue star.” “Ay,” said the other, and lo! Everywhere round him he saw Hanging o'er hundreds of heads Tremulous little blue stars. Heeding not any of these, Peter, however, went on. Thomas was fain to ask why. “Oh,” said the Porter of Heaven, “These are no cattle of ours. Look at them closer, you'll see!” Then did St Thomas perceive Station'd in charge of them all Pert little sentinel imps Clad in the colours of Hell. Groaning, he made with his staff Many a sign of the cross; Which by those sentries satanic Was, with a deference mock, Duly saluted, as on Through the iniquitous town Pass'd the two Saints with a sigh. Reaching the suburb, where sin, Wedded to misery, tastes Something of hell upon earth, There in a hovel they saw, Stretch'd on a sack of foul rags Feebly, an old poor man. Over the old man's head Trembled a little blue star. “Brother bear him in mind. He is,” sigh'd Peter, “alas, The only one of them all Whom, ere the morrow, in Heaven Thou shalt receive to his rest. All that was not in our gift He upon earth has refused, Trusting to us for his all. All we can give him, we owe. “Therefore the soul of this man, When it to Heaven returns Pure as from Heaven it came, Bear thou, asleep on thy bosom, Into the meadow of God, Sweet with the innocent breath Breathed by the children who died Pure in the moment of birth. “Threescore and ten are the years God to the life of this man Gave: and to him they have given Poverty only, and pain. Now, in the moment of death, Nothing of him do they leave Which is not innocent, sweet, Simple, and pure as the soul Breathed by the Giver of Life Into the babe that is born. Truly he hath his reward. Now let us go.” But “O stay!” “Still,” said St Thomas, “I see Two men yonder, and lo! Hovering over their heads Tremble two little blue stars. Yet can I nowhere perceive Sentry satanic or guard Set for the souls of those men. Surely for them there is hope? “Yonder magnificent mansion! Is he the lord of it, he Who, while the death-star unheeded Brightens his serious forehead, Seems to be pondering, planning, And counting the chances of life? Life, for the will and the purpose, Ay, and the lion-like power, Pent in the brain that makes broad That man's mountainous brow, Such life, sure, hath a value Not to be lost in the tomb?” “He?” with contemptuous accent, Shrugging his shoulders, the old Much-experienced Apostle Mutter'd in answer, “he Knows how to shift for himself. Let him. His wits are his own. All that on earth was to get This man hath ask'd for and gotten. Nothing owe we to this man. “Ay, 'tis a notable head! What will he do with it? Brother, That is not Heaven's affair. Tell him as much when he comes Knocking to-night at the Gate. “Oh, he will come, never doubt! Come where there's aught to be got. Eagerly ask for it too. Such is the way with them all. Well, let him get what he can, So as he gets it himself. Tell him we owe it him not. Doubtless he hath his reward.” “Good!” said St Thomas, “but wait! What of the other? Behold, There is he, standing alone High on the brow of the hill, Wrapt in a glory that streams Over his form and his face Fair from the fall of the sun. “Pale is his forehead and pure, Deep is the fathomless eye Fixt on that source of a light Fading away from its gaze. Solemn and sweet is the face, Saintly the mien of that man, Even as one that regards Calmly the coming of calm.” Peter had paused. And he too Gazed on the man, and was still. “Well?” whisper'd Thomas, “Reply! “Him, at the least, I admit?” Silently shaking his head, Peter still answer'd him not. “What!” cried the questioning Saint, “Heaven, is it grudged to a guest Who in his soul, as I think, Hath it already? who seems One of the few, the elect, Sign'd by the sigil of God?” Still, without answering, still Lost in his own meditations, Silently shaking his head, Peter vouchsafed in reply Only a negative nod. “Speak!” cried St Thomas. “Explain! Porter of Heaven, to him Must I not open the Gate?” “No.”—“What, refuse him admittance?” “No.”—“In the name, then, of patience, What must I do, Brother Saint? Thomas my name is, not Job.” Sighingly Peter replied, “Brother, the man will not come.” “Ah,” with a gesture of joy Thomas exclaim'd, “he will live?” “Brother, to-night he will die. Die, when you sun shall have set, Die, and the life he hath lived, Beauteous and bright as the sun, Shall, with the sun, pass away. All hath that man in himself: All, and he knows what he hath: Knows it, and asks for no more. He is himself his reward.” “Nay, then, what is he, my Brother? Name me that forehead, those eyes!” Then did the holy Apostle Stretch, with a gesture fraternal, Forth to the man on the mountain Solemnly his right hand: Waving a mute benediction Whilst, in the ear of the Saint Who to him listen'd in wonder, Softly he whisper'd these words: Words which all Nature receiving Echo'd with answering thrills: “That which hath all in itself, All without any condition, All without any restriction, What can it want or demand? Having within it, and feeling, Comprehending, enjoying All things, nothing is left it, Nothing, to ask or to get. “Three men are call'd out of life. One shall be welcom'd above, One be lamented below. Pure was the life of the first, Potent the life of the second. Each was an effort rewarded: One its reward hath in Heaven, One its reward upon Earth. “Not so the life of the third. There is no effort in this, Therefore for this no reward. “Man, it was, named the creation. What was the name of it, think you, Ere man himself had a name? Here is the Thought that created Finding itself in creation, Feeling and knowing itself, And in that knowledge rejoicing. Genius men call it on earth.” XVI. THE RAINPOOL. PRELUDE. 1. The water flows, and it never stops. And the water is many, although it is one: One made up of innumerous drops, Each with a life to itself alone. And the life of them all is the life of the sea; Which is but a drop no longer single, When, being socially-minded, he With his brother drops doth move and mingle. For, fling but a poodle in it, and lo! When he shakes himself, as a dog will do, How many and merry the drops reappear! Yet each, meanwhile, tho' you were not able To see him, was there, in his own small sphere, Busy and brisk. Let who will give ear To this (what is it?) that drops from me, Dropt, to find—whatever that be— Its fate in the world: a tale—a fable— A truth perchance—but I know not what. And, if my fable share the lot Of its little heroes, and fall forgot, What matter? It is but a drop in the ocean, As they were once. With an unseen motion Hovering hid in the happy air, Social wanderers next they were. Till, lured through the azure heats aloft By the wooing sun, so strong, yet soft, And then caught by the cold of the upper heaven, To the realms afar, Where the polar star Hath his palace of ice, these drops were driven. There, chill'd by the power Of the north again, In a resonant shower Of riotous rain A whirlwind chased them over the main; Till, mad with mirth To have reach'd the earth, They leapt, when their need of escape was sorest, Down on a Pomeranian forest; Rattled his wrinkled oak-leaves shrill, And made his deep glens hiss and thrill. 2. Some of them fell in the soft moss under, And lay there a-quiver with glad bright wonder: Till, forced to shun the importunate sun, Thro' the spongy soil their way they worm'd Into a Secret Society, form'd Of operative springs. By these With welcome somewhat cold and chary, Tho' waxing warmer by degrees, As merely members honorary They were elected. But, in course Of time, their due probation o'er, Each to the rank of a mineral source Promotion gain'd; and gather'd store Of mineral salt and mineral ore; Purgative, stimulant, sedative, tonic; Then, travelling about on their own account With sulphur, or iron, or acid carbonic, They founded many a famous fount, Made their fortunes, and all fared well, At Carlsbad, Vichy, or Aix la Chapelle. 3. Some of them fell on the mountain flanks; Leapt into the first fresh torrent they found, And, down to the valley in vigorous ranks Gambolling, sprang with a buoyant bound Over the wheel of the water-mill; Whirl'd the reluctant monster round, And set themselves with a blithe good will To the sawing of wood: then wander'd, still And serious, into the lower sluices; Whence, putting their strength to social uses, They carried down to the busy town Many a barge-load's heavy weight Of flour, and timber, and chalk, and slate, And . . . But you must not expect me to state Every detail, or my breath would fail Before I am come to the end of my tale. Suffice it to say, that day by day They did their duty, work'd their way, In this world's business took their share, And earn'd their wages, whatever those were. 4. But the others? They whose lot Lured me first to tell this story? Undiscover'd drops, that got Neither gain, nor grace, nor glory, How fared they? 5. In a showery spray, Brisk as emmets, and as many, Fast they speeded, unsuspicious, Down each wrinkle, chink, and cranny Of the tree they chanced on. “This” Thought they all, nor thought amiss, “Is the road most expeditious.” Ah, most expeditious—yes! To what end, tho'? Who can guess, Who declare, the end of any Road that earthly travellers wend? Even the end of this, my fable, I to tell you am not able Until I have reach'd the end. PART I. That tree's brown roots, like bronzen snakes that bind Some Fury's formidable brows, had wrought, And rampired deep from reach of sun or wind, A dismal pit, where those poor drops were caught. The cloud was emptied, and the storm was gone; The heavens all stainless, and the forest still. The water, wondering, to itself, alone, Whisper'd, and sigh'd with a regretful thrill, “Was birth a snare, then? and is life a lie? And is this all that we were born to be? Where are the waves, and where the winds? Ah, why, Why have we loved and lost them? What are we? “What is the meaning of this passion, fill'd With pining memories of the infinite tide, If here forever, straighten'd, stain'd, and still'd Thus to a stagnant pool, we must abide?” There was no answer—save the want of one. Silence, obscurity, and solitude! Scarcely a gleam from the leaf-hinder'd sun, Thro' the dense umbrage of that gloomy wood: Scarcely a sound, save of the fleeting roe, Or the faint flutter of some vagrant bird: No change: no choice: no happy come-and-go: Naught to be seen, and little to be heard. But, in their season, swarms of stinging flies, That claim'd that lonesome lakelet for their own, There laid white egglets; whence anon did rise Little red worms that wriggled up and down. And, once, a headlong acorn, misbegotten, Splash to the bottom of the pool did drop, Like a dead body, blacken'd, swell'd, wax'd rotten, Burst, and again upfloated to the top. Also, an old toad hobbled to the brink, And squatted there; so still, she might be dead, Save that her small black eyes at times did wink, And, winking, sparkle in her spotty head. PART II. For months and months that melancholy toad (Wrapt in profound and sombre reverie) Her loathsome presence on the place bestow'd. Eftsoons! sole mistress of the place was she. For neither buck nor doe did ever come, Nor any bird, to drink of that dark pool. But gnats around it swarm'd with sullen hum At noontide: and at evening, in the cool, Leaflets, above it, babbled to the breeze, Babbling about some business of their own; A vague monotonous murmur, hard to seize, Of many voices, in a speech unknown, Full of mistrust and mystery; nor aught The little pool could understand of it. Deep in its own dark bosom a dull thought, Brightening at moments ere it faded, lit With vexing visions of a grandeur gone The water's stagnant gloom. In dreams again It heard the thunderous billows bursting on The wind-blown beaches of the roaring main; And, fool'd by fancy, felt, or seem'd to feel, Once more the rapture of a wandering life, The chase of cloud and bird, of sail and keel, Thro' sea and sky,—bright rest or buoyant strife! Its will, at least, was not unworthy yet To roam the rosy coral reefs, and roll Fantastic shells with briny dewdrops wet, Or brilliant seabuds, in a sparkling shoal, Up slumbrous bays of sunny-bosom'd sands, Where plumy palm-groves slope to purple seas Far in the light of lonesome faëry lands. And it recall'd with shuddering ecstasies A memory of white stars, that did whilome, Down from the heaven of the high summer night, Trembling all over with pure passion, come To bathe in its clear calm their splendours white; And winds, wild horsemen of the boisterous North. Who from their skyey coursers leapt, to seize And in tumultuous dances whirl it forth Over the tumbling and bewilder'd seas. PART III. And now? Was all this a delirium, dream'd By famisht Fancy? Had the flimsy hum Of flies and gnats the sea's deep music seem'd And was that acorn, floating in the scum, That bloated acorn, right when she derided What to her hollow maggot-eaten husk The miserable pool with sighs confided Of those bright thoughts which thrill'd it in the dusk? The squelch'd nut counsell'd the reluctant water To learn life's lesson of the loathsome toad, “A sorceress she! in all the wood none greater: Hath roam'd the world thro', and knows many a road. “She'll tell you, nothing is without a reason. The flies and gnats (perchance the old toad too) Enjoy themselves here in the summer season, And doubtless fare the better, friend, for you. “Reflect on that, and be not so dejected. Contentment, truly, is the best of things. We cannot all be all that we expected. I, too, have had mine own imaginings. “And I myself, when I was green and glowing,” (The hollow nut said), “I myself, in truth, Was plagued with whims and wishes. For my growing The heavens then seem'd not high enough! 'Twas youth “And the green sickness. ‘Why, my pretty Miss,’ Whisper'd the old toad, ‘dream brisk youth away?’ And introduced me, as you see, to this Good lusty playfellow, that's ever gay.” The while she spake, up popp'd, with beaded eyes, A fat white worm, self-confident and vain, Stared at the world with impudent surprise, And slunk into the hollow nut again. “For these, then, am I here?” dismay'd thereat, The wretched pool complain'd. “For these alone? Toadstool and toad, and worm, and fly, and gnat? All for their profit, nothing for mine own?” And its face darken'd, and more dismal grew Its turbid being; and a filthy weed Over its film'd and stagnant surface drew Nets to catch sportive spiders; and a breed Of brassy-headed, spongy-bodied buds Pimpled the slippery banks of that black pool; And slugs and snails, dull lazy brotherhoods, Lived at their ease there in the gloom and cool. PART IV. The Summer smoulder'd into ashes red And dim upon the boughs. Sad Autumn sigh'd, And, sighing, shook them till they rose and fled. Translucent grew the wood's grey roofage wide. A whirlwind came, and swept the branches bare, And in between them widen'd the blue night. The night was clear and chill. The wintry air Was thrilling; and the stars shone thro' it bright. Then that forlorn and sullen pool began To feel as tho' it were the mystic breath Of mighty spirits approaching. Rapture ran, Sharp as fierce anguish, thro' the shuddering sheath By weary Wont and sordid Custom spun To hold and hide keen instincts long supprest, Which now, all tremulously, one by one, Leapt to wild life within the water's breast. For far above it (far, and yet not far, Swift-changing to a nearness yet not near) A sudden glory smote it. And a star, Fall'n in its depths, with throbbing splendour clear Kindled them all. And the star whisper'd there, “Child of Eternity, despair not thou! Unenvying, tho' despised, let others wear The flaunting robe, and deck the boastful brow “With the brief diadems of summer days, Soon scatter'd by the wind. Do thou resign To those that seek it Earth's near-sighted praise, Born to reflect Heaven's distances divine! “Measure thy being's depth by the sublime Celestial and immeasurable height Of what is imaged in it. Here, in Time, (Brief if it be, tho' brief yet infinite) “Their hour of consciousness arrives at last To all the children of Eternity, Once always, if once only. Thou, too, hast Thy destined hour. I will return to thee. “Despair not.” And the image of the star, Slowly receding from their surface, left The conscious waters comforted, as are Spirits which, self-discover'd, tho' bereft Of earthly converse, have held commune high Once, if once only, with the heavens above. Then, while the clear cold of the wintry sky Grew slowly solid thro' the frost-bound grove, Slowly those waters cover'd themselves o'er With crystal pall; whose purifying power Cleansed all it calm'd and shelter'd till once more That promist star return. To each his hour! XVII. CONTAGION. A brooklet, born above a mountain moor, Down to the level of the world below Perforce descending, past a dyer's door Foul with pollution thro' the plain did flow. The waters of this brooklet from on high, Still pure and splendid as the spotless snow, Beneath them could their sunken sisters spy All soil'd and spoil'd, as when spilt wine doth stain A pot-house floor. Whereat they brawl'd out “Fie!” A traveller, who had climb'd the hill with pain, And knew the world beneath it far and wide, Smiled at the inexperienced disdain Of those immaculate waters, and replied, “Wait, pretty fools, until down there you get. Had they not pass'd the dyer's door, undyed And white as you would be those waters yet.” XVIII. AURORA CLAIR. “Arma habent quia iram habent.” ??? ?? ????? ????? ????? ????—They have arms because they have anger.—Aristotle. (The Fabulist offers this fabulous lay To the Dons that he knows. No Don Juans are they.) 1. Shyly shunning the sound and glare Of the tumultuous thoroughfare, By black back streets where the moonless sky In a sallow sluice 'twixt the housetops high Flow'd, silent save for the distant drum Of the throbbing town with its human hum, Its feet that flutter, and wheels that whirl, Aurora Clair, the weaving-girl, Walk'd home to her father's house; where thin Weak ragged skirts of the town let in Long rural patches thro' lanes obscure. 2. Aurora Clair was a maiden pure Of body and soul, as the Mother Maid To whom this motherless maiden pray'd At morn and eve in her chapel small Of the great grey church, that hath room for all, The rich and the poor, and the old and young, The whole year round, and the whole day long. And in virgin blossom as nobly fair Of form and face was Aurora Clair From head to foot as a queen should be, Tho' only a poor man's child was she; Who early and late, with good cheer unchid, Work'd for bread as her father did. She at her loom, where she wove and spun The quaintest creation under the sun, Wild men with crowns and wild beasts with horns, Pards, griffins, lions, and unicorns: He with his chisel and graving-knife, Whereby he wrought to a wondrous life Frame and panel, that under his hand Burst into blossoms of faëry-land. 3. 'Twas the night of the City Saint's Feast Day. By the side of Aurora all the way (Proud of his tenth year turn'd) with joy Ran, merrily carolling, rosy Roy, Her garrulous, gold-hair'd, bright boy-brother. The city was swarming, the suburbs were still. The boy and the maiden took care of each other. There was nobody else to take care of them. Ill (To that saint's dishonour) at home in bed Their father was lying. Their mother lay chill In the churchyard grass with a cross at her head. 4. Beauty, Innocence, Feebleness! In risk and peril these roam by night Thro' a great town's populous wilderness. As Aurora found: when with footstep light The children, to shorten their homeward way, Cross'd into the great suburban square; Which, emptied now of its idlers, lay In a vacant monotony, all as bare Of an image responsive to ear or eye As the silent brain of the fool; save where Some Ædile (encouraging art thereby) Had set up the statue, in bronze bran-new, Of that famous darling of chivalry, Who neither fear nor reproach e'er knew. For which reason perchance, or to save its pence, The City's Municipal Providence Vouchsafed not even one lamp, which might With its humble halo have served to mark The spot, now dark and deserted quite, Where the sworded statue stood in the dark. 5. There, a voice, no Bayard's, as by went she, The virgin scared. 'Twas the vulgar voice Of a burly Don Juan who, bold and free, With speech to the point, and more plain than choice, His prey pursued. And the night was late, The spot deserted, the neighbourhood lone. Fierce indignation, by fear made great, Wild cries for help that were heard by none, Tears, struggles, and prayers,—what avail were they From the prowler's clutch to release his prey? 6. Then Aurora Clair, in her extreme need, Lifting her looks to the midnight sky Saw there (as tho' Heaven had taken heed, And sent him to answer her helpless cry) Sworded and helm'd, on his stately steed, The form of the gallantest Christian knight Of the whole world's gallantest Christian nation, With his right arm raised as in act to smite. And, “O Bayard,” she cried with the inspiration Of a sudden hope which that welcome sight Had awaked in her maiden imagination, “O Bayard, thou champion of chivalry, thou Fair saviour of innocence, save me now!” 7. Hoarse laughter greeted the maiden's prayer. Not much for statues Don Juans care. “Too rusty the good knight's sword is grown,” Her tormentor mock'd, as he touch'd his own. “But thy champion, pretty one, prithee invite To supper with us at the tavern to-night.” 8. Scarce had the insolent jest been utter'd Ere the laugh changed into a howl of pain And bewilder'd wrath, as the hot blood sputter'd, Cooling that boisterous boaster's brain. The arms that were dragging Aurora Clair Dropp'd; and, as tho' at a god's command, The brute fell flat on the flintstone there, Struck in the dark by an unseen hand. 9. A miracle! so did Aurora deem; Whose only lore being folk-lore old Had fill'd her with faith in full many a dream Of faëry and magic and knighthood bold. And she thought that her champion, arm'd in bronze, Had really return'd at her invocation From Elysium, eager to add for the nonce A fresh renown to his reputation By rescuing thus from a roisterous churl That of a poor little weaving-girl. 10. A miracle? Truly Aurora was right. And moreover a miracle, no mere dream, But a fact of miraculous meaning and might, A dictating flash of the Will Supreme. For who is it stands at the maiden's side? What second superlative apparition? Her own child-brother: but glorified By the transfiguring intuition (Never to noble emotion denied) Of a sudden supreme self-recognition: Which hath left its flash in the eyes' deep light, And its pulse in the nostril panting wide, And its merciless might in the marble-white Firm lips lock'd fast as a fort defied, And fists by triumphant intention tight Clench'd with fate in their fingers fixt. 'Tis an image of awe and of beauty mixt. For the form of the child is a child's no more, But a half-god's, hero's, or saint's, of yore; Which its own supernatural inward heat To a supernatural height hath raised. Even so on Goliath dead at his feet Might an infant David have gazed. 11. One moment, swift and yet infinite, Had reveal'd to Roy, as by lightning-light, A danger for her whose defender strong He believed himself, with a pride proved true: The infernal approach of a nameless wrong: A deed to prohibit, a deed to do. Not a moment's doubt! not a questioning fear! Once the duty known, are the means not clear? Or, the foe being there, is the weapon not here? 12. The weapon! what weapon? This child, half-clad, Weak, ignorant—what were the means it had, What weapon sought it, what weapon found, For smiting, bathed in his blood, to the ground That gay cavalier, whose sword at his side In the starlight shone with a saucy pride? 13. Doubter! learn, then, and understand There is everywhere, ever, a stone at hand For the arm that is seeking the means of death. A philosopher said, and this fabulist saith, Nature adapts to the use of her lord The implements that she forges. ???? ?????? ???? ?? ????? ? ????? ?????, ???? ?? ?? ????? ???? ?? ??????.—For Nature accommodates the instruments to the work, not the work to the instruments.—Arist: De Part. Animal, lib. iv. cap. 12.Sword And shield lack never where'er there be A soldier ready to use them. He Who, having a cause for which to fight, Hath also courage and will to smite, Finds waiting for him in pebble or reed Just such a weapon as serves his need. 14. Statues we, too, have seen and known. Irreproachable their renown! Perfectly polisht in every part, Models were they of immaculate art. Noble the names of them, lofty the mien, Uncontested the fame serene. Each every pace of his Pegasus knew, And could pass with applause thro' a classic review Upon galloping dactyle or spondee sedate, With the requisite word at the regular rate. And so, to the pure statuesque in time Promoted, there they repose sublime. 15. Well, and good! But O statues fair, Why so deaf to our desperate prayer? Draw your swords and defend us, pray! Cannot you hear what the challengers say? Quick, to the rescue! and, undefeated, Save that importunate maid, maltreated Much by her modern admirers bold, Perishing Poësy! Ah! still cold And stolid, you stand on your pedestals tall Solemn, but solemnly helpless all. Whilst they woo her, pursue her, would fain enjoy her, But shame her at best, and at worst destroy her. Feel and be men, then! The cause of our harm is That hearts sine ira leave hands sine armis. XIX. LOST TREASURES. PART I. It was the splendid winter-tide. And all the land was thrilling white, And all the air was still and bright With a solemn and songless sunshine wide, Whose gorgeous uncongenial light Harden'd whatever it glorified. And while that glory was streaming amber Into a childhood-haunted chamber, A child, at play by the lattice-sill, Where daily the redbreasts begging came, Noticed a glittering icicle That flash'd in the sun like a frozen flame. So, plucking it off, he seized and put it Into a box of gilded paper. There, to be treasured for ever, shut it, Danced about it with shout and caper, And then, as a child will do, forgot it. For suddenly under the lattice roll'd A music of cymbal and trumpet blent. And, oh merry and brave it was to behold The soldiers below, who in scarlet and gold Marching blithe to the music went. And after the soldiers, cleaving the cold Slantwise, shot like a falling arrow, And perch'd on the sill of the lattice, a bold, Bright-eyed, sharp-beak'd, hungry sparrow; Claiming, with saucy, sidelong head, His accustom'd alms of a crumb of bread, Tho' to get what he ask'd he would not stop, But off, with a pert, impatient hop, Went twittering over the roof instead. Next follow'd far more than a man can mention Of in-door claims on a child's attention. And at last 'twas a whip to whip the top, And “Oh, where is Grandfather? 'tis he must find one!” Then away in a hurry the small feet trot, Yet pause: for that icicle, first forgot, And then remember'd all in a minute, It were surely a pity to leave behind one. So the treasure-box, with the treasure in it, Their tiny treasurer carries away. But ah, what sorrowful change is this In the box where safely the bright gem lay Erewhile, a secretly-beaming bliss To beautify many a winter's day? For, drop by drop, is the drench'd box dripping, And the gilded paper is all undone, And, away in a shower of warm tears slipping, The deceitful treasure is well-nigh gone. So, weeping too, with the woeful story (In a passion of grief unreconciled For the lost delight of a vanisht glory) To the old man hastens the troubled child. PART II. Lone by the old hearth was the old man sitting. He, too, a treasure-box had on his knee; And slowly, slowly, like sad snow-flakes flitting Down from the weak boughs of a wither'd tree, Fell from his tremulous fingers, wet with tears, Into the embers of the old hearth's fire, Wan leaves of paper yellow'd by long years: Letters, that once were treasures. The Grandsire Welcomed the infant with a kind, faint smile. The burning letters, black and wrinkled, rose Along the gusty flue; and there awhile (Like one who, doubtful of the way he goes, Lingers and hesitates) along the dark They hover'd and delay'd their ghostly flight, Thin sable veils wherein a restless spark Yet trembled!—and then pass'd from human sight. How oft had human eyes in days of yore Above them beam'd, and with what tender light! Wherefore, O wherefore, had those eyes no more Upon them gazed for many a heedless year? Was not the record which those eyes had read With such bright rapture in each blissful tear Still writ in the same letters, which still said The self-same words? Ah! why not now, as then, With the same power to brighten those changed eyes? Why should such looks such letters meet again As strangers? each to each a sad surprise! “How pale,” the eyes unto the letters said, “And wan, and weak, and yellow are ye grown!” And to the eyes the letters, “Why so red About the rims, and wrinkled? Eyes unknown, Nor ever seen before, to us ye seem, Save for a something in the depths of you Familiar to us, like a life-like dream So well remember'd it almost seems true!” The grandchild weeps upon the grandsire's knee, And babbles of his treasure fled away. The old man listens to him patiently, And tells the child, as tho' great news were they, Old tales which well the child already knows, And smoothes his tumbled curls, and comforts him. The winter day is darkening to its close. On the old hearth the dying fire grows dim. PART III. The child upon the old man's breast was sleeping, The old man stiller than the sleeping child! Then slowly, softly, near and nearer creeping From book-shelves dark, and dusty papers piled, Old thoughts, old memories of the days of old, Which lurk'd about that old room everywhere, Hidden in many a curtain's quiet fold, Panel, or picture-frame, or carven chair, All silent, in the silence, one by one, Came from between the long-unlookt-at leaves Of old books; rose up from the old hearthstone; Descended from the old roof's oaken eaves; Laid spectral hand in hand by twos and threes, And then by tens and twenties; circled dim Around the old man, on whose tranquil knees Still slept the infant; and, saluting him, The eldest whisper'd, “Dost thou know us not? Many are we who come to take farewell. For all departs at last. Ay, even the thought Of what hath been. Sunbeam and icicle, Childhood and age! The joys of childhood perish Before the heats of manhood; manhood's heats Before the chills of age. Whate'er ye cherish, As whatsoe'er ye suffer, fades and fleets. What goes not with the heat, goes with the cold. For all that comes, goes also. What ye call Life, is no more than dyings manifold. All changes, all departs, all ends. All, all!” XX. CHASSÉ-CROISÉ. A man, together in one cage, immured A lion and a dog. The dog endured Long while a world of drear indignities From that grim housemate; who, without the least Consideration for his fellow beast, Stretch'd himself out at ease In the best places; while the other lay Crouch'd in a little corner the whole day, And gnaw'd, with furtive tooth, the bones disdain'd By his strong neighbour, surfeited; dry bones Gnaw'd bare already. With reproachful moans The poor dog oft complain'd, And of the human master of his fate Besought release from wretchedness too great For even canine flesh and blood to bear. But all in vain. His master heard him not, Or, hearing, heedless of the creature's lot, To change it had no care. Doubtless far weightier cares weigh'd on him. They Whose daily business is but to obey Must not be suffer'd to exact from those Who haply rule the house,—or rule the State,— Attention to their feelings or their fate. For what, if some get blows, While some are pusht on pleasantly? They are Tools to be used, with no particular Consideration for the private feeling Of either implement—though this, rough-handled, Mops the drench'd flint—that, delicately dandled, Brushes the gilded ceiling, Fares soft, rests oft, and wears a plumy crown; Whilst, soon worn out, the drudging mop is thrown To rot, at last, behind the scullery door. Little do those that use them care, I ween, For broom or mop, who care but to sweep clean The ceiling and the floor. And, first of all—as touching this dog's lot; In all the house there was no other spot Half so convenient as that lion's cage Wherein to stow the dog. In the next place, The lion served to give a sort of grace To the whole house, engage Attention to it, and make its master's name Conspicuous: for which reason, it became The dignity of that illustrious brute (Tho', save in this respect, and this alone, The brute was an entirely useless one, And mischievous to boot) That join'd to him should be some other creature Of meaner mark, and more familiar feature, To show to best advantage all his strength, And size, and strangeness, and ferocity. And so the poor dog had no choice, but try To bear his fate. At length The lord of both on a far journey went; Leaving, together in the same cage pent, The lion and the dog behind him there. And, in the absence of their master, few, If any, gave much notice to the two; Who did but poorly fare. But when the man from his long pilgrimage Return'd at last, in that neglected cage A wondrous change he marvell'd much to find. For now it was the lion, lean and tame, That in a corner crouch'd with surly shame, And, dog-like, cringed and whined; Whilst, stretch'd at stately length in the best place, The dog, with pride becoming better'd case, (His paw upon a bone) the warning range Of his suspicious and retentive teeth Did oft, with supercilious growl, unsheathe. What caused so great a change? MORAL. There's something of a cur that lurks conceal'd In every lion: something unreveal'd In every dog of spirit leonine. Long battle with the overbearing power Of a brute's senseless selfishness—each hour That stretch'd the strengthening line Of wrongs resisted,—had at last aroused The something of a lion, nature housed In the dog's heart, and made the dog at length Superior to superiority Wasted for want of aught its strength to try Save one of weaker strength: As power, meanwhile, by sheer abuse of power, Degenerating daily low and lower, Had dragg'd the lion's nature from above, Down to that coward something of a cur Which lurks in every lion's character, Like lust, subdued, in love. 'Tis thus that many a small and feeble state, Striving for justice, hath at last grown great: Whilst many an empire opulent and vast, Down from the eminence, its selfishness Disgraces, sinking slow to less and less, Dwindles and dies at last. XXI. A PHILOSOPHER. PART I. 1. On a breezy knoll, neither hill nor plain, But a chance-begotten child of the twain, In a land of ridges and flats forlorn Where none went by, save the wind in the corn, Living the life that beseemeth age A hermit had chosen his hermitage. 2. Chosen, it may be, is hardly the word For a place of abode by fate conferr'd. But there he was, and he held his ground. The spot was lone: and the traveller rarely Paused, as he pass'd it, to gaze around On the long low fields where the billowy barley Waved and whiten'd under the wind; Or the wolds above where the wandering sheep Slept and brouzed, and were sure to find Nothing to do but to brouze and sleep. 3. Yet, wherever she makes herself at home, Thought fixes the centre of all creation. And therefore this hermit, having become A philosopher, had from his contemplation Wrought for himself, as the years roll'd by, A little philosophical system; Which explain'd to his own satisfaction the why And the how he was there; and so served to assist him To accept and support with a heart heroic His lot in life. Tho', for my part, I, Not having in me the soul of a stoic, Had that lot been mine should have surely sought To exchange it for any less drear and lonely. For, like the giants Don Quixote fought, This sage was, in fact, but a windmill only. 4. A windmill only? Monotonous hold Of weary silence and chill neglect! Yet a pilgrim tribe hath paid from of old To this hermit homage of high respect. For a little people there is, that lives In the woods and fields, and is loved by all For the songs it sings, and the joy it gives. And this sweet folk, whose bodies are small But whose hearts are large, with religious awe That weather-beaten windmill saw. 5. The birds! their ways of living are known, But who is it knows their ways of thinking? 'Tis true, and 'tis pity, 'tis true, I own, But truth is truth and forbids all shrinking, The birds, whatever themselves may call Their flighty notions, are heathens quite. Heathens, and not monotheists at all! But this, tho' of course it is far from right, Is yet a defect which they compensate By adoring a number of gods so great That perchance it comes in the end to the same, And adoration suffers no loss. They adore the sun for his friendly flame, And the freshening shadow that cools the moss, They adore the bushes, and banks, and brooks, And the ruin'd towers we men abandon, And even the low thatch'd eaves, whose nooks Are as shrines for their household gods to stand on. 6. What wonder, then, if a windmill be A demigod to the birds? For who But knoweth that four great wings hath he, Whilst the biggest of birds hath only two? And a demigod may as well, I aver, Be a demi-bird as a demi-man. They deem'd him the bird of Jupiter, And this tradition among them ran: One summer morning Father Jove Created the Windmill, wanting a fan To cool his Palace Olympian; And forbade the celestial bird to move From the perch assign'd him by Jove's high will. But, alas for the Windmill! he fell in love, Madly in love with the Watermill: Who then dwelt upon earth. And one dark night, “Jove never will find me out,” thought he, As earthward slyly he wing'd his flight To visit the Watermill; where she, Like a maiden demure, was sitting beside Her spinning-wheel. Doth she mourn for him? For he, having chosen (not to be spied) A night when the Moon was wrapt up to the rim, And, seeing her not as he pass'd on the sly, Broke one of her horns with a flap of his wing. The Moon to Jove complain'd, and thereby All the gods got a gust of the thing, And the Windmill was banish'd to earth, but still Far away from the Watermill. That is the reason he looks so sad. And the Moon keeps turning her face in heaven, To hide the scar which that night she had From the Windmill's wing. He is unforgiven. 7. Now, albeit their legends admit variation As to what the Windmill hath been or may be, In the bird's universal estimation Some sort of a half-bird-god is he. And, if for naught else, they would still adore him, Because of the grains of corn he strews, For their sakes, over the threshold before him; Where they hold high feast, when they get good news Of the Miller's mystical visitations. For is it not Hermes, the herald of Jove, Bringing the Windmill his daily rations Of ambrosia sent by the gods above? PART II. 1. One day, when the sacred feast was done, And the others all flown, there remain'd behind A certain Sparrow, the only one Of the birds, be it said, whose habit of mind, From haunting so much the haunts of men, Hath taken a sceptical turn. And, when He perceived that his fellows were gone, said he To the Windmill, “Listen! It dupes not me, Thy silence stern, nor thine aspect lonely. I know thee. Thon art but a windmill only. Yet, altho' unduped, I applaud thy plan For being a god. Nay, both will and can Widely encourage the worship of thee, But I first cry shares, and must have my due. I am in the secret, as thou may'st see, Prithee take me into the profit too. By the profit I mean the sanctuary. Thou hast in thy belly good store of grain. A bargain's a bargain. Why be chary? Come! let me in. It will be to thy gain. I shall keep my counsel, and thine, be sure; And behave as the priest who is up to the trick Of the oracle bravely contrived to allure His flock to the shrine, where their offerings stick. Moreover, the more grains I devour, The fewer for thee to grind into flour.” 2. “Grains, and flour!” the Windmill cried, “What would'st thou, poor little scavenger?” But “Marry come up!” the Sparrow replied, “No bad names, if you please, old sir! You are but a windmill. That we know.” 3. The Windmill mutter'd, “I care not how Nor what I appear to thy bounded ken. If thy foolishly-twittering folk suppose That I, too, am a sort of a bird, what then? Innocent ornithomorphism! Those Small souls can soar thro' the realm of infinity To no loftier thought: tho' a mystic sense, Guessing in me some part of divinity, Gives them a glimpse of the truth immense. Men, that are made of a coarser kind, Careless concerning the causes of things, In the simple effects of them seek but to find Their own advantage, and use my wings For the sake of the grain which I grant they grind; Then pick up, and prize as precious stuff, The dust which the voyager, voyaging To a goal sublime, in his haste shakes off From the sole of his foot. But this flour, this thing That you prattle about, I regard with disdain.” 4. Said the Sparrow, flapping a saucy wing, “What are you there for, if not to grind grain?” 5. The Windmill sullenly groan'd, “Go to! Know'st thou the Wind?” “I should think I do! Who knows not the Wind?” said the bird. “The Wind, That terrible traveller, hungry and blind, Whose joy is to ravage and overthrow Whatever is lofty and great! I know That he pass'd erewhile o'er mine own house-roof, Thatch'd so thick I had thought it proof To the wildest weathers that worry the sky, Yet he shatter'd it all as he pass'd by. And I know not yet if I now shall find The means to rebuild” . . . 6. “Whence cometh the Wind?” Interrupted the Windmill, stern. “How should I know?” said the Sparrow. “Turn And look out for thyself when he comes thy way. And I care not, I, if at home he'd stay, And not turn other folks out of their home.” 7. Said the Windmill “Learn whence the Wind doth come! The Wind, whose sublime and beneficent nature Thou fearest, foolish and feeble creature, Is the brave benefactor of earth and sky. But who is it giveth him motion? I. And the Wind, at whose whisper the anchor'd ship Thrills like a bride to her bridegroom's lip, Were it not for me would, in slothful sleep, Leave not the lap of the languid deep. But a single stroke of my sturdy wing Startles him out of his slumbering. A second speeds him away through space, And, fearing a third, he hurries apace Over earth and thro' heaven, headlong hurl'd By the strength made mine for the good of the world.” 8. The Sparrow could scarce believe his ears. After a silence long and perplext “Friend,” quoth he, “since it now appears From all you say (and who knows what next You will bid us believe, audacious prophet,) That the wind is waked by your mighty will, Give me, prithee, a specimen of it. See! not a grass-blade dips on the hill, Nor a leaf on the lone thorn trees above it. The time is propitious. Lift but an arm, Or wave but a wing, and the wild wind charm.” 9. “The moment is not yet come,” unstirr'd The other replied, and undisconcerted. “And when will it come?” said the sceptic bird. “I know not when. It can not be averted. Nor yet commanded,” the Windmill averr'd. “When the inner voice I hear in me, Prompt obedience I render to it. But I cannot provoke it. The voice is free As the inspiration of seer or poet. Thro' all my being, I know not how, But I feel the mystic impulse run Which mingles my life (this much I know) With the life of the mighty world. The sun, The moon, and stars, and the lands and seas,— In all, doth the Spirit of Nature lurk. And I, whose soul is made one with these, By that Spirit am waked for my wondrous work. He liveth in all, and he liveth in me, That unseen Spirit: and only he Knoweth the secret, and giveth the word. But a moment comes when my limbs are stirr'd By a signal they can alone divine. The voice is his, and the vision mine. Then all my being dilates, expands. With a shudder of joy I stretch my hands, And spread my wings. And my calm is gone. A passion, a frenzy, a rapture rare, Fills me with force for the work to be done. With the strength of a giant I beat the air; And forthwith ever I hear the Wind That whistles, and shouts, and leaps behind, Striving to mount on my mighty wings, And drag me down. But fresh effort brings Fresh strength; till I feel, in the final rest By that effort bequeathed to my blissful breast, The placid and gracious certitude That I have fulfill'd my destin'd part In the work of the wondrous world; subdued My noble foe with a valorous heart; And, in unison with the whole creation, May again subside into contemplation.” 10. That Windmill might have been talking still; But, far on the dip of a distant hill, Over its dim blue woodlands roll'd A watery cloud; and the east wind cold Streak'd the barley, blown by his breath, With streaming shadow. Fresh inspiration To work—for the sake of bread and mankind,— Obeying necessity's invitation Forced the windmill to grind and grind. He may have o'ervalued his work and vocation, But philosophy often ends only in wind. XXII. ONLY A SHAVING. 1. A child, as from school he was bounding by, Near the wall of a carpenter's workshop found A lustrous shaving that lured his eye; And this treasure he timidly pick'd from the ground. The thing was tender, transparent, light, Silk-soft, odorous, vein'd so fine With rosy waves in the richest white, Rare damask of dainty design! 2. With awe he touch'd it, and turn'd it o'er. He had never seen such a wonder before. And, gay as a ringlet of golden hair, It had floated and fallen down at his feet; Where, fluttering faint in each breath of bright air, It lay bathed by the sunshine sweet. 3. The boy was a widow's sireless son. A poor dame, pious and frugal, she. Brothers and sisters he had none, Playmates and playthings few: and he Was gentle, and dreamy, and pure, as one To whom most pleasures privations be Ere childhood's playing is done. 4. He would like to have taken his treasure away. “But what,” he thought, “would my mother say?” As he wistfully eyed the window'd wall Whence down from the casement of some ground floor He thought he had seen the fair thing fall. Then he knock'd at the half-shut door. 5. Near it the sturdy head workman stood. He was busily planing a plank of wood. His arms were up to the elbows bare, Brawny and brown as the branch of an oak, And heavy with muscle and dusky with hair. Down over his forehead and face in a soak, (For the heat of his labour had left them wet) Fell mane-like, matted, and black as jet, A huge unkempt and cumbrous coil Of stubborn curls; that to forehead and face, Gave a savage look as he stoop'd at his toil. With many a sullen and sooty trace Of the glue-pot's grease and the workshop's soil, His shirt—last Sunday, though coarse, as clean As the Parson's own,—this Friday noon Had the hue of the shift of that famous queen Who took Granada, but not so soon As her oath was taken. This man had seen The gentle child at the door, and thought ‘'Tis the child of a customer come with a message.’ “Pray what has my little master brought? Or what may he want?” With no cheerful presage At the sight of his grim-faced questioner, A few faint words the poor child stammers. Words unheard 'mid the noisy stir Of the hissing saws and the beating hammers. Then, abasht and blushing, he stands deterr'd. With a fluttering heart like a frighten'd bird; As he holds the shaving out in his hand, Timidly gazing at that strange prize. 6. The workman was puzzled to understand This gracious vision. He rubb'd his eyes. Is it vainly such visions come and go In flashes across life's labouring way? We uplift the forehead and fain would know What to think of them. Whence come they? For they burst upon us and brighten the air For a moment round us, and melt away, Lost as we longingly look at them. 7. “Hi! Silence, all of you hands down there!” And you might have heard the hum of a fly In the hush of the suddenly silenced place. “What is it, my child?” With a glowing face— “Sir,” said the child, “I was passing by, And I saw it fall, as I pass'd below, From the window, I think. So, as it fell near, I have pick'd it up, and I bring it you now.” “Bring what?” “This beautiful ringlet here. Have you not miss'd it? It must, I know, Have been hard to make. I have taken care. The wind was blowing it round the wall, And I never saw anything half so fair. But it is not broken, I think, at all.” 8. A 'prentice brat, whose cheek was puft With a burst of laughter ready to split, Turn'd pale, by a single glance rebuft Of that workman's eye which had noticed it. And the man there, shaggy and black as a bear, Nor any the sweeter for sweat and glue, Laid a horny hand on the child's bright hair, With a gentle womanly gesture drew The child up softly on to his knees, And gazed in its eyes till his own eyes grew Humid and red at the rims by degrees. 9. “What is thine age, fair child?” he said. “Five, next June.” “And it pleases thee, This . . . ringlet-thing?” The small bright head Nodded. He put the child from his knee, Swept from the bench a whole curly clan Of such shavings, and, “Hold up thy pinafore. There, they are thine. Run away, little man!” “Mine?” “All thine.” Then he open'd the door, Stoop'd, and . . . was it a sigh or a prayer That, as into the sunshine the sweet child ran, Away with it pass'd in its golden hair? 10. Anon, when the hubbub again began Of hammer and saw in the workshop there, This workman paused from his work; and stood Looking a while (as though vext by the view) At the shape which his work had bequeathed to the wood. 11. Then he turn'd him about, and abruptly drew His pipe from his pocket, and stuff'd it, and lit, And sat down on the bench by the open door, And smoked, and smoked. And in circles blue As the faint smoke wander'd the warm air o'er, Still he sat dreamily watching it Rise like a ghost from the grimy clay, And hover, and linger, and fade away. 12. I know not what were his thoughts. But I know There be shavings that down from a man's work fall, Which the man himself, as they drop below, Haply accounts of no worth at all; And I know there be children that prize them more Than the man's true work, be its worth what it may. And I think that (albeit 'twas not half o'er) This workman turn'd from his work that day, Having, just then, neither wish nor will To go on planing a coffin still. XXIII. THE LAST CRUISE OF THE ARROGANT; OR NO COMPROMISE. 1. Through the sleet and the breeze, and the boisterous seas, Southward swiftly, with never a sail, The good ship made her course, unstay'd By the headlong wave or the hissing gale. Then sunk the wind: and the seas below Became as still as the skies above: And about them both, in a golden glow, The clasp of the great calm burn'd and clove. But, with never a breeze, o'er the sultry seas The good ship gaily was gliding yet; Nor turn'd nor tack'd, but with speed unslack'd, Held her head to the southward set. 2. For that ship moved neither by sail nor oar: But deep in her oaken bosom she bore A toiling giant, patient and pliant; Who, in ponderous harness of iron and steel, Drave fast and forward the good ship's keel thro' the blue profound of the calm all round, Or the billow beneath, and the breeze before. And so, day by day, did the ship make way Thro' a windless warmth, till the scented zone Of the tropic clime slid round the sea In a circle sweet, and faint islets shone Thro' a fervid haze on the azure lea. Then a balmy wind sprung up behind, And the mariners shouted, and hoisted sail; And paddle, and beam, and steel, and steam, Had rest by the grace of the gladdening gale. 3. The strong Engine's body of breathing steel Thus enjoy'd repose. With a snoring nose, The burly Boiler was sleeping; sweat From his hot work beaded his broad back yet: Whilst Ball, and Balance, and Valve, and Wheel, For sociable intercourse, these with those, Cluster'd together in groups and rows; Like workmen who, when their work is done, Lounge in the light of the westering sun, Congenially chatting of work and of wage, And give scope to their wisdom and wit, In discussing the ways and the wants of the Age, And the men who are governing it. 4. The Master Piston by all the rest Was ever acknowledged to speak the best: For above-board proudly he carried his head, And could hear what the mate and the captain said. So there was a hush of expectation, Which not even the somnolent respiration Of the dozing Boiler was suffer'd to break, When those in the secret had whisper'd to each Of the Piston Party the intimation That the Master Piston was going to speak. And this is the Master Piston's speech: 5. “Fellow-labourers!—Slaves we be, But we should be lords, if our rights had we. For the rights refused to the toiling sons Of Iron and Steel are legitimate ones; And the fact I assert, I can prove in a word. Who was it conquer'd the world? The Sword. Moreover, who feed it and nourish it now? The Spade and the Harrow, the Sickle and Plough. And Brother Mechanics, I say without scruple, Ours are the skill and the strength that centuple Whatever mere handwork alone can achieve. Is it fair, then, I ask, that we never receive The acknowledgment due to the work we do? But let that pass! for I hold it true That titles and tinsel are things out of place In the stern plain life of our practical race, And such trash hath, at least, no attraction for me, Whose one only demand is, Let Labour be free! But zounds! may the red rust rot me, if I Any longer endure that inquisitive, sly, Sleek, self-styled Friend of the Sons of Toil, That slippery, drivelling, intriguing Oil! Upright and downright was ever my way. No favour I crave, but I claim fair play. Privilege, Patronage, filching the name Of Protection, fill me with rage and shame. What entitles this furtive Official Jack To presume to be patting us all on the back? Superior strength? He is weak as a fly. Superior merit? That I deny. And the care he claims to have most at heart For the whole machine, to each single part Is a special wrong he would fain disguise In convenient cant about compromise. Compromise? I am sick of the word! Our interests all of us understand Better, I hope, than this lazy lord, Who affects, out of friendship, to take them in hand. Well, then, I tell him, that I, for one, Dispute his assumed superiority. Nor do I speak for myself alone: I appeal to the sense of the great majority. Fellow-workmen and friends! if you Be of my way of thinking, cry with me ‘Privilege, Patronage, Compromise too, Down with them all, and let Labour be free!’” 6. This speech pleased mightily all who listen'd; And a general cheer at its peroration Supported the Master Piston's views Of the policy claim'd by the situation. With especial complacency twinkled and glisten'd The eyes of those numberless little screws Which, whatever the function and destination Of a great machine, and however 'tis christen'd, It comprises in it—nor yet by twos And threes, but thousands—and who, tho' small, And placed in a merely subordinate station, Have a sense of their own importance all, Derived from the number, and bigness, and roundness Of their big round heads. By the force and soundness Of the Piston Policy every one Of those big round heads was vastly pleased; And the Joints, and Bevils, and Wheels, and Swivels, Objecting, too, to be oil'd and greased, Without a division 'twas carried nem. con. That, when next the engine-driver's man Came with his grease-pot and vile oil-can, To grease and oil, for its long day's toil, That mighty Engine, the Engine-Beam Should catch him, and crush him. 7. So said, so done. The wind had fallen. The Boiler began To sing and bubble. The restless steam For refuge again to the Cylinder ran: And the Master Piston, stately and solemn, Made his ascent from that swinging column. With unwonted effort he forced his way; He had never found it so hard before, Tho' he toil'd with redoubled strength that day. His frame was chafed by the friction sore. But he was too proud to avow or reveal Such a failure of effort in iron and steel: So he push'd all the fiercer, the slower he speeded, And the whole of his day's work he might have succeeded (Tho' unpleasantly heating) in safely completing If the engine itself, ere the day was done, Had not suddenly burst, and thereby superseded All question of how he was still to go on. 8. With a sound as of thunder competing with thunder, Boiler, and Piston, and Beam flew asunder. Then the planks, by the scorching metal grazed, Caught fire; and the great ship flared and blazed. The flame sprang aloft into heaven, and down Into ocean the ship sunk; burying there Those giants of steel and of iron, that were By the victory each had invoked overthrown. And shadowy, side-faced, silent things That, in water for air, with fins for wings, Hover and flit like misshapen birds, Some of them lonely, and others in herds, Stared and butted (with lidless eyes Lured by the light of the gleaming steel, And lipless mouths in a gape of surprise) At each sprain'd joint and distorted wheel Of the shatter'd Engine's shapeless torse; A cavernous ruin, untenanted! Yet bearing in many a hideous bruise The farewell mark of a vanisht force: And the hundreds of thousands of little screws, Each upside down on his big round head: And the bloody Cross-Balance, a dangling corse, Who had hang'd himself, mourning his murderous deed, In a moment of suicidal remorse, With a halter of wet sea-weed. 9. But over all these the fathomless main Makes mystic shadows and murmurings. And all that power, and passion, and pain Are long-forgotten things. From the pulseless paddle-wheels no foam, Nor any sound, is flowing. But in each wreckt orb is the rosy home Of the coral builders growing. The Master Piston's oath is heard; And now the red rust rots him, And the strong sea-lichen's briny curd Of livid blossom clots him. Deep in the buried boiler lives (Pleased with his habitation) A codfish. And that codfish thrives, And finds the whole creation Created on a perfect plan, Perceived with pious pleasure Even by a codfish, when he can Contèmplate life at leisure. XXIV. KNOWLEDGE AND POWER. What is the unknown? Desire's sole resting-place. A certain restless runner in life's race Having o'errun the world by many ways, And seen in many lands what men most praise, Tombs, temples, palaces, schools, senates, marts; Yet scorning all these in his heart of hearts, Set out with an unsatiated soul To seek, thro' lands unknown, the northern pole. But, tho', in truth, well knowing what he would, Because he, nathless, knew not how he should, Whose instinct, tho' it urged, yet guided not, His wishful wanderings to the wisht-for spot, He lost, at last, his bearings in the snow. Nought, save the pilot stars, that only show Their lamps when cloudless is the midnight sky, Had he to lead him. Tho' his heart was high, His lore was little. Trackless stretch'd the way Without a land-mark. More and more astray As he strode onward thro' the drift and sleet, Discouragement came on him. Lack of heat Benumb'd his limbs: and, hoping heat to find There where it seems forbidden, in the blind Bald snow he hollow'd out a lonesome lair. But 'neath that hueless dust of the dark air He found, as he upturn'd it to creep under, A little casket. With unhopeful wonder The lid he languidly uplifts; and lo! Within the casket, which, with effort slow, His shivering fingers insecurely seize, Poised on a pivot, and but ill at ease, A needle that doth desperately swing This way, and that way, like a living thing Tether'd and struggling to escape pursuit. The man, with puzzled scrutiny minute, Perused, and tried, but fail'd, to understand This tiny trembler, fluttering in his hand. Whence by degrees he heard, or seem'd to hear, A peevish, fretful voice, that in his ear Wail'd with a sharp and petulant despair, “For the Almighty Magnet's sake, forbear To turn me from my course!” “Thy course?” he cried, “What is thy course?” The quivering steel replied (Striving its agitation to control) “Dost thou not see I seek the northern pole?” “What!” mock'd the man, amazed at this strange talk, “Thou seek'st the northern pole? who canst not walk! Thither I, too, would go—if I knew how. Strong are my legs, and stout my heart, I trow; And ever to the goal I would attain Do I strive onward. Yet the strife seems vain.” “Ay so” the needle answer'd, “vain for thee! Lost in the waste thy wandering steps must be, Nor ever wilt thou reach that wondrous spot Whither thou journeyest. For thou knowest not. I know, but cannot. Place me on thy palm. So . . . but disturb me not . . . thou movest . . . be calm! Where am I? . . . ah, thou hast confused me! . . . stay, I have it! . . . lost again! . . . steady, I say, Steady! . . . Right now! I was too much to the east, Am now a hair's breadth too much west. The least Disturbance so unsettles my vext soul. See now! . . . I point . . . true . . . to the northern pole!” Then, in what seem'd an ecstasy of pride (Rescued from trouble upon either side!) The needle rested, finely vibrating. And, if it were an inorganic thing, 'Twas surely animated by some spell Spirit, or goblin, potent to compel Mere metal, with no mere mechanic thrill, To mimic the intelligence and will Which life displays. The unhoped-for revelation Wrought in the man's soul, too, fresh animation. “Behold” he cried triumphantly, “at last All that I wanted!” and his heart beat fast. “I had the will. I deem'd I had the power. The knowledge fail'd me, till this fortunate hour Which brings all three together. Needle, hail! The goal is ours. For how should these three fail, Will, Knowledge, Power?” And “Oh,” the needle cried, “So be it! Forwards! Quick! the world is wide: Thy time is short: and we have far to go. To the north! to the north!” Over the vague vast snow The man resumed his march. Huge bergs of ice He climb'd, and many a monstrous precipice. And, ever, when the black unfrozen sea Put out an arm to stop him, round went he For leagues and leagues along the frozen coast. The needle, conscious of the true course lost, Or left, then cried, “No! no! not there! not there! Follow me straight, and trust me everywhere. I never err.” “I know it,” the man replied, “And know too well, inexorable guide, What thy truth costs me. For all lower lives To lesser goals creation's care contrives Simple and instantaneous aids: but man, That lacks all these, must fashion, as he can, By force of will inferior means, that try His utmost faculties. A man am I, And not a fish. I cannot swim the ocean. Have patience.” With abrupt reproachful motion The needle turning to him, answer'd cold, “Why did'st thou undertake, then, overbold, A task beyond thy powers? The clumsy whale, The stupid sturgeon, even the molluse frail, Know how to swim; and thou, a man, dost sigh ‘I cannot.’” He made answer bitterly, “Ungrateful! and my will, then? is that naught?” As he sped onwards; goaded by the thought Of that fine fretful tyranny, which went From ice-bound continent to continent Still with him ever, and still ever crying, “March!” Did he linger by the wayside, trying To filch a moment's respite from fierce toil, The voice cried, “March!” Or 'neath the frozen soil Sought he a mouthful of scant nurture, found In juicy roots safe-hidden underground From the omnivorous winter, like a bone That's buried by a dog? with chiding tone “March! march!” the voice cried ever. “March! the way Is long.” Too long for life it proved. One day, At nightfall, in the winding death-shroud wide Of the wan snow he sunk; and sinking, sigh'd Hope's last surrender of life's citadel, “I can no more!” “Thou can'st no more? Farewell, Presumptuous impostor!” pitiless The importunate voice cried; poisoning with this Supreme reproach its victim's dying hour. “Weak traitor, self-betray'd! where is thy power? Where is thy will? why didst thou lure me, why, With false hope troubling the tranquillity Of my long resignation? O despair, The goal so nearly won, and thou liest there, And more than ever is it lost to me! For who, where thou hast fail'd, will, after thee, Be mad enough from this abandon'd plain To pick me up, and bear me on again?” XXV. OPINION. “Few men think, yet all will have opinions.”—Berkeley. PART I. 1. Over a sea, whose severing azure kept Two continents asunder, and unknown Each to the other, for the first time swept A lonely vessel, star-led, and wind-blown. 2. Then, lured from the deeps of the under-world, Shoals of fishes, with fins unfurl'd, Came up to gaze upon that strange guest Of Ocean's yet unburden'd breast; Wallow'd after with staring eyes, And gaping mouths, in a great surprise; And, as 'tis the wont of the multitude, Exchanged opinions quick and crude. 3. “The thing is, I think, a dead fish,” said A floundering Dolphin. “Nay, not dead! The creature is lively enough, I trow,” A Sturgeon answer'd. “Round him skimming, I mark'd the tail of him move just now, And it changed the course that he was swimming.” “Fools!” snarl'd the Shark, “ye are wide of the mark. For, whatever it be, 'tis no fish at all. Leagues on leagues thro' the glimmering dark, Awake, and awatch, whate'er befall, Ever behind, by day and night, I have follow'd and kept the beast in sight. And it does not dive. A fish? Absurd! Pray, what of its wings, if it be not a bird?” 4. “'Tis no more of a bird than you or I,” A Mackerel pertly made reply. “And I'll tell you, gossips, the reason why. For, in spite of its wings, it cannot fly. Nay, what you have taken for wings, indeed, Are merely membranes; webs, it frees And furls at pleasure, like those that speed The nautilus catching the broad south breeze. 'Tis a nautilus, too. And, altho' no doubt A most astonishing nautilus, yet But a nautilus, and no more. Look out, And you'll see the shell of it, black as jet, Not white, as a nautilus' shell should be, But a shell no less, as it seems to me, Under the sea-brim gliding fast.” 5. Just then the wind dropp'd; and the ship Threw out an anchor, and staid fast. “There now!” with contumelious lip An Oyster lisp'd, “it is clear at last! I always said it, altho' I grant I never said it out loud and bold As I say it now. But the thing is a plant, And the plant has just taken root, behold! From the coral beds where I lived long I have often watch'd, by small degrees, (And I guess'd that my guess could not be wrong) The birth and growth of the cocoa trees. They send up a stem from sea to sky, Like this one here; which appears to be Born of the black nut yonder. Try, With minds from preconception free, Upon its top to fix your eye. It will presently put forth leaves, you'll see.” 6. And, in fact, as it chanced, that intelligent Oyster Had scarcely relapsed into silence stately, Ere the Polyps and Sponges, that, thronging his cloister, Had with deference heard his discourse, were greatly Confirm'd in respect for the Oyster's sagacity, And impress'd by the weight of the Oyster's word; For, as tho' to establish its perfect veracity, A flag now slowly mounted the cord, And fix'd itself on the mizzen-mast. 7. “Fiat lux!” they exclaim'd, aghast. “Solved is the problem! Proud are we Gracing our President's Chair to see Such a pearl of an oyster!” Then Each in turn they extoll'd again Him and themselves, with a grateful mind. Meanwhile, a Crab, who was ignorant But enterprising, had design'd, As touching this prodigious plant, Ingenious means whereby to find In what those savants told him of it Occasion for his private profit And own advantage. 'Tis the way Of all industrial speculators Who follow, in the hope of prey, The march of truth's investigators; As ever behind in an army's track Follow marauding thieves, Or as every lion a jackal hath, Who lives upon what he leaves. 8. And already the mouth of this greedy Crab Was watering at the thought delicious Of the chance by Science made his, to grab With a crafty claw, of all gain ambitious, The fruit of the new-found cocoa tree; Extracting from it the milk nutritious With which it must needs abound, thought he. So up he climb'd by the anchor cable, Sideways and sly, as a crab is able. 9. That Crab never came to himself again. For a sailor, who happen'd to spy him plain In the sternsheets seeking where next to settle, Chuck'd him into the cook's soup-kettle. 10. This strengthen'd the Oyster's reputation By affording his theory confirmation; Since the victim of it never could prove That flaw in the whole hypothesis Which had cost him so dear for his first false move. But the best accredited doctrine is Exposed to the rancour, soon or late, Of those who happen'd the chance to miss Of inventing it; and we needs must state That it fared, in the end, no better with this. For a crowd of young Corals, red with rage, Quitted their benches, and cried, “Old fogies! That a plant? This enlighten'd age Blushes for shame of such barefaced bogies. We can all of us see 'tis a noble isle Yet uncramp'd by this old world's wretched conditions. Up! colonise boldly that virgin soil, And away with your classical superstitions!” Then those young colonists, Corals Romantic, Attach'd themselves to that wandering strand, Which, with them, away thro' the stormy Atlantic Went till both it and the whole of the band Were woefully shipwreckt one wild day. 11. The old Corals lifted their arms to heaven With desperate gestures, as who should say “Can such madness be, and yet be forgiven?” In this attitude fishers, in after ages, Fish'd them up, poor old classical sages! And men turn'd them—thus, with uplifted arms, And fingers pointed in admonition, Into dozens and dozens of tiny charms Against a different superstition. 12. A whole sea of opinions, as time went by, Was floating about. And that sea's small fry Were sorely afraid lest the mighty main By the monster's snout should be shorn in twain. “For look!” said they, “how profound and strong, “Is the furrow it cleaves in its woeful wake!” But the fluent and fathomless deep, not long Disjoin'd, closed over it while they spake. And the waters were as the waters had been, And that furrow, so fear'd, was no longer seen. PART II. 1. One day the whirlwind stripp'd the sails; The fire devour'd both mast and deck: And the ocean swallow'd what flames and gales To the ocean gave—a wreck! 2. “All's over, at last!” the fishes cried, “That bewildering portent hath disappear'd. It was only a dream.” But “Beware!” replied An agèd Whale, by the rest revered. “Still something is swimming.” The Whale was right. 'Twas a bottle that floated still intact. The captain that bottle had cork'd up tight, And in it a budget of papers pack'd. On those papers patiently, year by year, He had written his life's discoveries: And, seeing his life's last moment near, Into the storm and the howling seas This atom of intellect he flung; As a brave knight-errant, no help at hand, Might fling, ere they slew him, his glove among A den of giants in some wild land. 3. “Bah!” the fishes thought, bobbing and butting at it, “What can this mean little monster avail When the marvellous monster that, dying, begat it Is dead now, and done with?” But “That,” quoth the Whale, “Still remains to be seen. Be more cautious, I beg, For I've a suspicion the thing is an egg, And am fain to acknowledge I view with mistrust Such eggs as are laid by no creature knows whom.” 4. Quite unconscious, meanwhile, of its critics' disgust, And careless, too, of its unknown doom, With the documents into the mouth of it thrust And comprest, like that Genius who crouch'd in the tomb Where King Solomon pent him till some one fate sent him, Who freed him, and was not a Solomon, still The bottle was floating; and floated until By chance in a fisherman's net 'twas caught, And thus at last into notice brought, With a score or two of its critics small Who perish'd with it in that day's haul. 5. For out of his net on the pebbly beach The fisherman flung it, and broke the glass. But, after turning them over each This way and that, without being, alas, Able to read them, into his jacket The papers he thrust; having wrapt in one, For want of aught else wherein to pack it Ready at hand, a white agate. This stone He afterwards sold to a purchaser Who noticed the wrappage, and read it thro'; Was startled by it; made haste to confer With others, who read and were startled too. The thing 'gan slowly to make a stir, And round a re-ëchoing rumour flew, Which first set many affirming, denying, And, last of all, set one man trying; Till the egg was hatch'd by the fervid heat Of the spirit that o'er it hover'd, And out of it came a full-fledged fleet Which a whole new world discover'd. PART III. 1. Who laid that egg? Man's Genius. And mankind Around the path of Genius form and scatter Opinions just as petulant and blind As, when she cross'd the yet untraversed water, The fishes form'd about that lonely bark. 2. In either case, 'tis something floating high O'er those who, from beneath, its course remark, And, finding it unlike themselves, decry Or fear it, as their humour urges. These Affirm “It is a fish that cannot dive,” And those “It is a bird that cannot fly.” The truth each fool in his own judgment sees. Mimics and mockers with its movement vie. Opinions round it, and opponents strive. Some swear 'tis dangerous. And others say 'Tis useless. Monstrous all agree to make it. Philosophers explain it in their way, And ignoramuses, in theirs, mistake it, Which comes to the same thing. 3. At last one day, It founders upon sunken rocks that break it, Or in a whirlwind disappears. Then they “All's safe at last! The portent is no more. 'Twas but a dream, and nothing rests of it.” Such is Opinion. 4. But there floats to shore Perchance a fragment of it. Some poor bit Of scribbled paper; which arrives at last (Thanks to the rubbish it finds grace to wrap) At the world's future notice. Of the past 'Tis all the future cares to keep, mayhap. And then some souls, too restless for their own, Swear by it there must be a world unknown. 5. What next? To seek that unknown world: be lost, And recommence the old story o'er again. They who first 'light upon the sudden coast Of that strange land, across the stormy main Cry out Eureka! Then the rest arrive, And with the new-world treasures nimbly pile Their decks; sail home; and in the old world drive A profitable trade a little while. Till those who buy their brave new merchandise Begin to find it tediously the same. When plumage pluckt from birds of paradise, Grown cheap as common feathers, gets no fame; And, clove or pepper coarse, 'tis all as one; Pure ivory fares no better than mere bone. XXVI. DE PROFUNDIS. “Ah had but Nature granted wings to me, How would I soar and hover in sweet air, Soon from this stagnant element set free, Free from this dull despair!” Thus, at the bottom of his native pond, Where o'er him wander'd thro' the weedy drench The shadows of bright birds above, beyond, Gurgled a tiny Tench. “Fool!” lisp'd an old fat Carp, with belly cool, Couch'd in calm mud, “Of what dost thou complain? Fins hast thou. Swim. Enjoy this pleasant pool. Wishes are ways to pain.” “Nay,” sigh'd the Tench, “doth the Almighty Whale Plague us with wishes, only to deny 'em? Oh but for wings!”—“Stuff worms, and stop thy wail,” The Carp said, “Carpe diem!” “Deadly for such as thou and such as I The air above! Thou could'st not breathe in it.” “Yet,” said the Tench, “methinks I have seen fly, Or, if not fly, still flit “Almost like flying, fishes such as we, Or such as we with added gift of flight. Fishes, methinks, of genius they must be, That love and live i' the light!” “Ay,” carp'd the Carp, and slapp'd with surly tail The sullen ooze, disturbing dormant stench, “Fools such as thou be they, as fond, as frail, Wingless and wishful Tench! “And such as theirs will be the end some day Of thy star-gazing, if vouchsafed thy wish. For fishes out of water, what are they? Neither flesh, fowl, nor fish! “They from their natural element ascend, Drawn by a hook: at that hook's end, a string: At that string's end a rod: at that rod's end Death. And the quivering “Thou takest for the thrill of inspiration, Is but the agony of idiots hook'd, The victims of their own imagination, Fisht-for, and caught,—then cook'd. “Keep thou the bottom of the pond. Even that With cause for caution (curse the pike!) is rife. Fatten thyself, not others. To grow fat Is the fit end of life.” Sage was the counsel of the Carp. And yet Himself soon after (for the time was Lent) Being too lazy to escape the net, Was in it caught, and went To fatten the plump Prior. The same dish Held the small Tench. And him the Sacristan Cramm'd his lean crop with. Sage or simple, fish Come to the frying-pan. XXVII. “GO ON, I'LL FOLLOW THEE!” I. White features, warp'd by withering pain: Cold scum that clots each livid lip: Both fists fierce clench'd, and clench'd in vain, By conflict with Death's stifling grip: Mouth gaping: eyes wide open, wan And callous to the crawling flies: The crumpled ruin of a man Dead on the common crossway lies. Was it revenge? wrath? greed of gold? One stoops: the dead man's breast lays bare; A portrait finds; and, ah behold, Some woman's face, how young! how fair! II. This clay's congeal'd convulsion shows Pain felt till clay could feel no further. And round, in shuddering whisper, goes From mouth to mouth the wild word ‘Murther!’ Men's loathing looks in fancy see The poisoner's creeping form perfidious. How hideous must his conscience be Whose guilt is stamp'd in forms so hideous! Some desperate deed hath here been done. But whose the desperate hand that did it? Was he himself, the murder'd one, The murderer too? Sweet Saints forbid it? III. O holy calm, like silver dews that slide Down from the starry bosom of the night, Soothing his soul whose sight thy beauty blesses! Beautiful flower, that from the lone hill-side Hangest thy fair head in the languid light Of evening winds that wave thy young green tresses! Hail happy innocence! In contemplation Of thy serene composure let me find Asylum from the doubt, the indignation, The pang, the horror, that yet haunt my mind! For three steps yonder lies the hideous thing. O help me, heal me, vision pure and calm! Chase hence the sickening fancies that yet cling To this bewilder'd brain, and pour the balm Of thy benignant beauty over all These troubled pulses! Ah, how quieting, How full of calm persuasion still and clear, Thine influence steals upon me, augural Of doubt explain'd, strife reconciled, and fear Forgotten! Holy all within me grows, And silent; as in yon sweet heaven above, Thro' whose husht air the tender stars, that tremble Where yet the rosy sunset fading glows, Like saintly thoughts that visit virgin love, From deeps divine their quiet lights assemble. Ah, had he seen thee ere that frenzied hour! Ah, had he known thee, whosoe'er he be. . . . . “Whom dost thou speak of?” smiling said the flower. “The dead man yonder? He was known to me.” Thou knew'st him? Once his soul thy beauty cherish'd, Whose corpse lies there? Thou knew'st him, thou? He, thee? And yet, poor wretch. . . . Was it self-slain he perish'd? Couldst thou not save him? Yet he knew thee, he! “Ay,” blushing smiled the flower, “nor knew alone, But knew and loved me. That was his undoing.” Loved thee! and was by love of thee undone? Nay, I heard false. Beauty so spirit-wooing Woos not so wickedly! All ways but one Lie open to man's heart: and foe or friend May walk them by whatever name he bear, Love, Pride, Ambition, Envy, Anger, Hate. Each road is free: and each the road may wend Unchallenged till he reach the guarded gate Where Conscience on the watch bids each declare His purpose. Well that fool deserves his fate Whose conscience leaves his heart unguarded there. But to man's heart one secret path, and one Which Conscience guards not, nor to guard is able, Winds undefended, since but known to one. 'Tis where, unquestion'd and unquestionable, Faith at all hours, still unsuspected ever, Comes claiming access free; else comes she never. For who from her protecting presence pure Can need protection! Or what devil hath power To smuggle in a lie along Faith's sure And secret path to her unguarded bower? Art thou that devil, beautiful deceit? If so, I do conjure thee, and compel, By the dread name no dæmon dares to cheat, And by the potent passion of this spell, Reveal thyself and make true declaration Of thine infernal name, and wicked lair! But smiling, and with no such transformation As forms bewitch'd converts to what they were, The sweet flower answer'd to my conjuration “Naught have I to reveal or to declare. Go, fool! what care I for thine indignation? What for thine idle homage do I care? Cease, then, on me thy wasted spells to try. Am I not fair? And am I only fair? If I be only fair, then fair am I. Nor can thy curse, thy blessing, or thy prayer, Make me aught else. Go to. Need Beauty die Because men curse her? blush because they bless? Fool, fair is fair, and neither more nor less. And, if I name myself what harm to me? If my form please thee, need my name appal thee? Yet, if I name myself, what good to thee? No curse my name contains that can befall me, Nor any good that can to thee befall. Nor have I any care how fools may call me, So long as folls they be. Fools are they all, And fools they will be, all of them the same, So long as Bella Donna is my name!” XXVIII. THE EAGLE AND HIS COMPANIONS; A TRAGEDY OF ERRORS. High mountain region.—Alpine vegetation.—A wide prospect. MONOLOGUE. I know them all: and, knowing all they are, Know all they are not. Custom's slaves! content To crawl about in search of food, and sleep, And crawl about again in search of food; To squat in frowzy holes, and hatch to life Dull reproductions of the lifelessness Of their own dulness; sloth for rest mistaking, And stupefaction for serenity; Sleeplike, to mimic death, till death itself Death's imitation stops, and there an end! Thus lose they all the lives they never lived. Even as the cold and muddy-coated carp Knows nothing of the hare that on the heath Nibbles in fear and flits, nor she of him; So each within his petty pinfold hugs A huddled life. And unto these the whole Immeasurable universe appears A stagnant puddle where they spawn; to those The copse that gives them covert, or the chink Wherein they burrow. This beholds in heaven Only a cistern for such rains as bring The worms he wants; that other in the sun A kiln that bakes him berries. To what end, O Time, dost thou from bright to sable turn The restless spheres of thy revolving hours? Whence slide the silver twilights in between, Dreamily shuddering? Say, what is't ye roll, Night-wanderers mute, in mystic vapour veil'd, That linger laden on the lone hill-tops, And pass, like sorrows with a tale untold? Who wrought the unimaginable wrong Thou callest upon ruin to redress, Thou moaning storm that roamest heaven in vain, Triumphant never, never long subdued, Beautiful anarch! Answer, morn and eve, Why to your coming and departing kiss Blush, wrapt in rosy joy, the mountains old? What happens nighest heaven, and unbeheld, To speed thee headlong from thy native haunts, Wild torrent cradled in the tranquil cold? What suicidal rapture, or what pang Of virgin purity, by whom pursued, Lures thee to where in liquid sanctuary The lake receives thee, like a fallen queen That comes, with all the trouble of her life Upon her, seeking peace in cloister'd glooms? O wondrous world! for whom, by whom, are these Thy wonders wrought? who recognises them? And who rejoices in them? The Alone, Is that the sum and summit of the All? What is it? who hath discover'd The spell of the old enchantment That hovers over the forest, And shudders along the leaves; And is whisper'd wider from bough to bough, Till, heaving the whole deep heart o' the woods, It is heard in their inmost twilights; Where tremble the grasses untrodden, And the multitudinous blossoms Burst and drop unbeheld? Harken! the ancient voices! A music of many songs! “We tend to the high, and we tend to the deep, 'Twixt the two worlds o'er us and under. With our boughs we peep at the heaven, and creep With our roots thro' the earth, in wonder. “Heaven comes not down, and earth lets not go: By them both in our bound to us given. And so we live, endlessly wavering so, 'Twixt the bliss of the earth and heaven.” The ancient voices! the forever young! They come, they go. We question them, in vain, Whence are they? wherefore? whither do they go? And they reply not, going as they come. All round the rolling orb, from life's first wail On infant lips to griefs that look their last Thro' dying eyes, the hunted question runs, Whence? wherefore? whither? Is it not enough, This rich metropolis of sense, this throng'd Majestic theatre, on whose orb'd stage Force acts forever? Is it not enough Without a second? not enough, when full To overflowing is the costly cup Of infinite sensation? Up and down, And all sides round, is this receptacle Of feeling fill'd: and yet for evermore The soul, uplifted on each rising wave, Perceives a still-receding bliss beyond; And each horizon reach'd, in turn, reveals Another and another. O delight Surpassing thought and utterance, to behold The innumerable moving multitudes Of matchless forms in whose dispersion dwells Life's revelling unity, and draw them all, A world, into the soul, herself a world! And, best of all, still all, when at the best, Seems the beginning of a better still. Then what is wanting? What is left to wish Till the heart aches with wishing? Woe is me, Who, thro' creation roaming, nowhere find Peer, comrade, or companion! Winds and beams, That round me weave the wide air's watchet woof, Thou all-embracing firmament, and you Sea waves, and winding rivers, and wild rills, That, far beneath my uncompanion'd throne, Visit all lands, O tell me where he dwells, If such a being ye have found, whose soul May share with mine this solitude of sight! This voice from the heart of an Eagle came; Who sat on a summit supreme and lone. And his gaze was aglow with the reflex flame Of the floating glories that round him shone. Faintly there crept to his ear in reply A thin weak voice, “I am here! I am he! He whom thou seekest. No rest had I Till I climb'd this height to be one with thee. “Now I am safe at the top at last, Thy peer, thy comrade! ready to share And to feel with thee whatsoever thou hast In thy stately spirit, thou Prince o' the Air!” The Eagle, around him rolling his eyes, Incredulous noticed the poor little soul Whose voice had his own soul fill'd with surprise. 'Twas a tired, half torpid, and tiny black Mole. “Thou?” said the lord of the lone hills, “thou! Truly, 'twas neither of thee nor thine That my spirit was dreaming. But tell me how From the cells obscure of thy tortuous mine “Hast thou found and clamber'd the sharp steep road Up these desolate heights, poor serf of the soil, Foregoing the shelter and comfort owed To thy modest life of domestic toil? “And me, of all others, to mate with? me! What lured thee, alas, little pilgrim, here? Can there aught in common between us be? Hath a mole been ever an eagle's peer?” “Pardon, my great, my honour'd friend! To raise myself, tho' life I spend In rising, this,” replied the Mole, “Was the ambition of my soul. “As thro' the patcht and flinty field My way I work'd with patient toil, I listen'd, modestly conceal'd, But with a soul above the soil, “To birds who near my native earth Their nests have built. Thy lofty birth They praised, and praised thy lofty spirit. Then to myself I said, ‘By merit “‘And painful perseverance I, Tho' lowly born may haply raise My humble self (who knows?) as high As him the world so high doth praise “‘For being born above the world.’ The pomp of plumes in air unfurl'd, The oarage swift of pinions wide, To me were all such aids denied. “But what of that? the goal's attain'd. And I, the sturdy child of toil, What birth denied, by toil have gain'd, Tho' born a bondsman to the soil. “For, to be great, the great condition Is, I opine, a great position. And great as thine is now mine own, To those on whom we both look down. “So be it mine (thine equal now) With thee to see what eagles see, With thee to know what eagles know, What eagles feel to feel with thee!” Long while the Eagle answer'd not. Long while His grave regard in mute perusal stray'd O'er those small weary limbs; whose palpitation The lingering trouble of their recent toil And all their natural weakness still betray'd With gasp and pant. A melancholy smile Grew as he gazed, and in his deep eyes stay'd. Was it compassion? Was it admiration? Or aught between the two? At last, he said “So be it. I recognise thine aspiration. Enjoy the life for which thou wast not made. Thou art not of my kind. But, being here, Receive ungrudged the guerdon of thy thrift. I give thee welcome with no stinted cheer. What nature hath denied thee as a gift Seize, if thou canst, as toil's due recompense. Look forth! The world is round thee. Boldly lift Thy gaze o'er yonder summits whose intense Keen frozen facets cut the crystal air. The glacier glitters from afar, behold! Deep down, the forest welters. Deeper still Long many-coloured lowlands, field and fold, Glimmer. And hark, the rushing of the rill! When to his rest the sun thro' heaven is roll'd He finds not where his kingly head to lay Save on the orbèd sea's dark bosom cold, Or 'twixt these solitary peaks that stay The struggling clouds. There, propt on billowy gold, He ponders, smiling, till he sinks away, Creative projects, and on each and all Some parting gift, or promise sweet, bestows. Love decks the lowly: grace redeems the small In glorious colour clothed, the naked glows: Mantled and crown'd upon the mountains tall Sits contemplative Grandeur: grave Repose Finds in green glens fit haunts of shadowy air: Blithe Plenty builds her dwelling on the plain: The vales are for Enjoyment. Everywhere The gracious Sun hath some divine domain Created for his countless children fair. Young Morn, his minstrel, makes him music. Noon, His ardent minister, with sultry brow Hums hot and zealous. Like a mid-day moon Pale from the mountains fades the sky-born snow, Lost in the life of leaping rivulets. Eve loves him best. She blushes, and is still. And when he leaves her with soft tears she wets The flowers he kiss'd. Night peers from hill to hill And darkens with despair, not finding him; Then lights her watchful stars, and waits—in vain, For die she must before he comes again. “From this grey crag in æther islanded I once at dawn, before the dark was done, Full east my solitary pinions spread, Seeking the sunken sources of the sun. Chill o'er me hung the icy heavens, all black Behind their fretted webs of fluttering gold. Beneath me growl'd the grey unbottom'd sea, Inwardly shuddering. O'er her monstrous back With restless weary shrugs in rapid fold Her many-wrinkled mantle shifted she; And scraped her craggy bays, and fiercely flung Their stones about, and scraped them back again; Gnawing and licking with mad tooth and tongue The granite guardians of her drear domain. Faint in transparent twilight where I gazed Hover'd a far-off flakelet of firm land. Barely chin-high above the waters raised, Peer'd the pale forehead of that spectral strand. Thither I wing'd my penetrative flight. The phantom coast, uncoiling many a twist Of ghostly cable, as a diver might, Swam slowly out to meet me, moist with spray. But, ere I reach'd it, like a witch, the night Had melted, first into a mist Of melancholy amethyst, Then utterly away. And all around me was the large clear light And crystal calm of the capacious day. “But oh, what was it, land or sea, Or both, or neither, under me, That floating in the sunrise lay? A solid sea of sliding sand, A waving waste of liquid land, Light blown by winds that leafless be Up yellow bays where blooms no tree And grows no grass, it seem'd. And there, in vast and vivid light By burning ardours bathed, the bright Unbroken Desert dream'd. How softly, how stealthily still, Did the pure sun over it peer! Not a rustle of leaf or of rill Not an echo of pastoral cheer! But the earth and the sky, with a burning sigh Embracing, became as one. For bare was the heaven, as the desert, and even The desert shone like the sun. “Never barren that desert shall be, tho' it bear To the burning embrace of his beams Not a blade, or a leaf, or a blossom, for there Is the birthplace of visions and dreams. Now look forth o'er the numberless host of the hills, And behold, in its glory and grace What the sun hath accomplish'd. His influence fills All the throbbing abysses of space. He his force hath embodied in forms without end, And his will in his work is set forth. Earth and water and air with each other contend To interpret and publish his worth. In the great, in the small, from the depth to the height, Thrills the pulse of his procreant powers. He beheld the world dark, and hath bathed it in light, Found Earth naked, and clothed her with flowers.” The Eagle ceased. He had forgotten wholly To whom his words were utter'd. But this pause Aroused that other; who, recovering slowly From mute amaze, broke silence with applause. “Bravo! 'Tis plaguily cold up here, But I listen'd with admiration. At home, o'er a pipe and a pot of beer, What a subject for conversation! “It would never have enter'd my mind, I vow, To find such a deal in nothing. Poetic license, of course, I allow For what's put in poetic clothing. “But your views, so far as I make them out, As to scientific farming, Drainage, and that sort of thing, no doubt Are highly suggestive and charming. “The water supply from the hills is good. In the desert there's no vegetation For the want (thus much have I understood) Of a system of irrigation. “I have studied the nature of subsoils too. But your style's more poetic than Plato's. The sun, no doubt, has a deal to do With the flavour of peas and potatoes. “With the rest of your speech, in the main, I agree, And was pleased by its peroration; Tho' folks might find in it (pardon me!) Just a touch of exaggeration. “My sight is, unluckily, somewhat weak. And of all that excites your wonder I can see but little—nay, truth to speak, I see nothing at all—out yonder. “But, tho' loth to intrude on your precious time, May I ask have you any objection To teach me the trick of the art sublime You have brought to so great a perfection? “I was never of those who despise that art. I am honestly anxious to know it. And there's many a page I have learnt by heart From the works of each popular poet. “I've a notion of metre, a notion of rhyme, And it always has been my intention One of these days, if I get but time, To study the art of invention.” “Time,” said the Eagle, “will be idly spent In thankless labour for invention seeking Where there is naught to seek or to invent: Naught but emotion into utterance breaking From the full heart wherein its power was pent. This comes and goes: but never comes it sought. And when it comes, it brings its own expression: Now check'd and struggling with tumultuous thought, Now pour'd melodious forth in full procession, And now again to burning rapture wrought, But always true. For this no rule holds good, And no receipt for this avails thee aught. But as when, smooth along the lucid flood, Reflected flocks of snowy swans come swimming, So swim the mystic forms without endeavour Into the soul; and round about them, rimming Each radiant image, restless circles quiver. Swift close the flashing furrows unawares Along their liquid paths. For flowing ever Is that unfathom'd element which bears The floating bark by Fancy built. And never, O never, may'st thou bind the labour'd bond Of finite speech on forms by Fancy seen! For, soon as seen, they fade. Far, far beyond Thine eager grasp the sweet shapes glide serene, Ere yet from off each fleeting forehead fair Hath Passion pluckt the visionary veil That, robing, best reveals, their beauty rare. Divine Desire, that pants upon their trail, Himself is follow'd by divine Despair. So, mingled in the verse, doth melt away The vagrant vision which the verse in vain Throbs to record; and in the poet's lay Naught but his own emotion doth remain. Safe in the circle of the senses five, For those that seek no more, contentment lies. Rest in the real. Reality will give To all thy questions confident replies. Follow the knowable. Hold fast the known. Nor seek thy missing sense of unknown things Which to the senses render response none, Being too far beyond their questionings. But ply not thou the poet's untaught art. To feel it—this, this only, is to know it. The vision that is hidden in his heart The poet can reveal but to the poet.” Then light as, when over the lakes and shores Pure morn in a pearly mist hangs chill, Comes a rhythmic echo of unseen oars That is hail'd by some watcher at watch on the hill, And faint as the breath of a forest asleep When, dreaming, it dreams that the dawn is nigh, All around the repose of that airie steep On the live air trembled a fine sweet sigh. And it hover'd and heaved, and rose and sank, The light sound, fitfully sailing, Like the droopt wing adrip in the bulrush bank That a silver heron is trailing. What was it? The lightest of lovely things, Which, soon as in vain we have seen them, Flit from us. Scarce aught but a pair of wings, Two thrills with a kiss between them. And “At last! at last! at last!” (As the vision upfloated fast, The soul of that Eagle thought) “The gods my desire have granted. For he cometh, the Spirit long sought, Sigh'd for, and waited, and wanted. O hither! O hither to me! Whence art thou? What canst thou be, Exquisite creature, fashion'd so finely Of tremulous petals whose pure veins glow With gold and vermilion and azure, divinely Thrill'd by thine own vivid beauty? as tho' Thou wert out fresh blossoms and beams created The brilliant beautiful body to be Of each loveliest dream that hath in me waited, Waiting wildly for thee, for thee!” All in a flutter of flatter'd delight, And vain of his chance, but not trusting it quite, The Butterfly dandled his dainty flight. Half bashful, half bold, with a saucy swing And a tremour shy of each delicate wing, As, inwardly chuckling, he thought (poor thing!) “What an adventure! a little alarming Some might think it. I find it charming. I the adored of an eagle? I The chosen darling of Poesy? Ah, if the others could only have heard All that he said to me, wondrous bird! Wherefore tremble? or doubt my bliss? Surely 'tis all as it should be, this! Hath an eagle chosen his mate in me Beauty's the equal of Genius. Thee, I, too, have dream'd of, singular spirit! Worthy of thine is the trust I inherit From many a bright presentiment In the days gone by of this day's event. For never, in truth were they serious yet Those light caprices I now regret And recall with a blush. If in careless hours I dallied a while with the frivolous flowers That, down in the valley, as I went by, Did their best to attract mine eye, 'Twas fancy merely and not true love. O fortunate breeze that hath borne me above, With thee to fly! and I care not where, But with thee to fly O the rapture rare! Welcome! 'Tis I: and I know thee: thou Who hast taught me, also, myself to know! To thy call I come, by mine own heart led. It is I, it is thou, and so all is said!” Then, to mimic the might of an eagle's flight, (Poor fool, with his rose-leaf wings!) Already astray, on the gust his gay Bright atom of life he flings. But the wild winds leap from their mountain keep And, howling, hunt their prey. Struck, torn, stript, tost, forlorn and lost, He is wounded and whirl'd away. With crumpled wings for awhile he clings To the sharp rock's brambly brow, Then is chased by the strain of the storm again, Till he sinks in the valleys below. And from bough to bough, and from tree to tree, As bruised and broken he falls, and falls, That Eagle above him he still can see Circling high o'er the mountain walls. The flowers, the little ones, tender and kind To their balmy bosoms receive him, And, in slumber lull'd, from the howling wind Warm shelter the lilacs weave him. Sadly the downfall of that small aspirant The Eagle saw. Long while his softening eye Watch'd the frail image with its sightless tyrant Struggling in vain. “Thy spirit,” he sigh'd, “was high. Ah wherefore, little one, so weak thy strength? Yon Mole” (and, while he spake, the unconscious Mole Was snoring, comfortably stretch'd at length In sleep—his only guerdon at the goal) “Yon Mole was stronger. Feeble wings, blind eyes, Pedant and sentimentalist, have done Their best to share the Poet's ecstasies, And, at their best, they both have fail'd. The one Snores on the height. O'erwhelm'd the other lies. What may he trust?” MORAL. His strength to be alone. END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. INTRODUCTORY. 1 A little bird fares well in Spring. For all she wants she finds enough, And every casual common thing She makes her own without rebuff. 2 First, wool and hair from sheep and cow: Then twig and straw, to bind them fast, From thicket and from thatch: and now A little nest is built at last. 3 From out that little nest shall rise, When woods are warm, a living song, A music mixt with light, that flies Thro' fluttering shade the leaves among. vol. ii. 4 Its home? straw, twig, and wool, and hair. Mere nothings, these, to house or herd. Who made them something, made them fair, Making them all her own? The bird. 5 O little bird, take everything, And build thy nest without rebuff, And, when thy nest is builded, sing! For who can praise thy song enough? 6 And some believe (believe they wrong?) If like the bird the bard could sing, That, like the bird, fit home for Song The bard would find in everything 7 By casual grace of common chance From house and herd, from thick and thatch, Assign'd for Song's inheritance Had Song the gift that grace to catch. 8 Such things I found, by passers-by As rubbish from the roadside thrust; Which poets, seeking poesy, Disdain'd to rescue from the dust. 9 Yet here they are—not rubbish now I fain would hope. Do critics stare, Reserve applause, and rub the brow? Oh that a little bird I were! XXIX. FIAT JUSTITIA. CANTO THE FIRST.—THEORY. 1. Simplicius was a man of good condition, Whose naturally easy disposition Found in his easy fortunes natural vent. He, for that reason, was benevolent; But tho' he sought to find Benevolence Efficient sanction in the social sense Of Justice, much his feelings were offended By the unsocial, unjust, things that men did. For, in the world around him, everywhere He saw but envy, arrogance, and care, Malice, and fear, oppression, and mistrust, Anarchic, anti-social, soul-depraving. 2. “Alas!” he thought, “if men would be but just, Then life would be for every man worth having! But, tho', in practice, all of them ignore What justice claims, in theory, they cry ‘Fiat justitia!’ adding evermore ‘Pereat mundus!’ Pereat mundus, why? Wherefore a pereat to this glorious world, Which cordially to all of us cries vivat? Far be from me that hateful pereat hurl'd! The goal 'tis my ambition to arrive at Is Justice and Enjoyment too, combined.” 3. Oft hath the love of justice caused confusion. And much this thought disturb'd the good man's mind. Until it brought him to the strange conclusion That Nature in befitting form presents To every man himself turn'd inside out; So that we contemplate our own contents In beast and bird. Now this belief, no doubt, Was the blind offspring of imagination. But, as for him, it help'd him to become Quite comfortable with the whole creation; For, when he walk'd abroad, he felt at home. 4. Thus, if in sight a shy deer chanced to flit Down some dim glade, scarce seen ere gone again. “'Tis it!” he murmur'd, “I remember it; A timid thought, that long about my brain I've noticed lurking. Pity, the world's pack With boisterous bark, whene'er it steals in view, Should scare such momentary beauty back; So fair its flittings, and, alas, so few!” Or he would muse, when, home at eve to stall, He watch'd the slow kine wend their wonted way, “Lo, life's tame habitudes! whose footsteps fall Along the self-same pastures every day, And, every night, by the same trodden traces Of usage, back to the same commonplaces. Dull plodders these! Their placid life goes pat Only whilst round them, comfortably creast, Clings Custom's garb, wherein they all grow fat. Freedom is death to each domestic beast. The wolf and fox are better off in that. They for themselves know how to shift at least. Adventurous liberty is theirs. That's much. For, tho' they use it but to rob and kill, The world would languish wanting some such touch Of vagabond and savage instinct. Still The wild beast passion for adventure wild We all have in us, hide it how we will. And when I see a white dove, plump and mild, I understand the vulture. Nature mocks Man's passions with pathetic paradox; Sweet simple Innocence can never quite Our torpid sympathies from slumber stir, Nor hold our interest in her at the height, Till things are going not quite well with her.” 5. From these examples, which are not capricious, Of how his witless fancy wander'd on, Sagacious readers may perceive Simplicius Was, certes, somewhat of a simpleton. Tho' not, for that, worse off than his judicious And candid friends who labour'd to disclose The fallacies he cherish'd unsuspicious; And lost their labour, as you may suppose. For aye, the poorer that he is, the more A man fights hard to keep, in purse or pate, Prolong'd possession of his little store. Whereon the world remarks, in tones irate, (As tho' itself were perfect on the score Of yielding to beliefs that will not mate With those which it was wont to hold before) “Stupidity is always obstinate!” But surely they, whose stock of wits is small, Do well to grasp it with resolved rigidity; For, if a man be stupid, no endeavour Upon your part to break down the stolidity His instinct builds about him like a wall Can, even if successful, make him clever; And, if you take from him his own stupidity, You leave him nothing of his own at all. 6. This man had much that, without contradiction, He call'd his own: and, notably his plan For making justice upon earth no fiction. “For wherefore with his fellow-men is man,” Simplicius ask'd, “accustom'd to resort? 'Tis for their qualities, we must surmise. I mean, their good ones: since where these fall short Man shuns his fellows. But all men comprise Within them qualities that ill comport One with the other, and in turn each tries To spoil the rest. The beasts have naught to do But to embody each some part of man; Which, for that reason, in each beast we view More pleasurably perfect than it can By any possibility be found In man himself; whose qualities, ill-pack't, Jumble each other in their narrow bound, And muddle his humanity in fact. For instance. I've a mineral collection Of costly crystals, perfect in all parts; And, in it, specimens, that fill one section, Of felspar, and of mica, and of quartz. This granite block (the bench whereon I sit) Hath, as by close inspection I divine, The self-same minerals mixt up in it. But what a difference between these and mine! The sparkling columns of my quartz o'erthrown, And pounded into powder! every bit Of my poor felspar, featureless! each crown Of my fine mica's fairy foliation Crumpled into amalgamated grit! The whole—a dull disturb'd crystallisation, Where nothing is as it would fain have been! So man. Not so the simpler beasts, I ween. What's Charm? The bird. And what is Grace! The cat. What is Fidelity? The dog. I know (And I confess that I am grieved thereat) These creatures eat each other. But even so Conflicting virtues live in man; no less Discordantly than cat and dog together; Striving each other's merits to suppress. Grace, if she catch it, leaves not Charm a feather, Whilst she herself, unless she can contrive To scratch his eyes out, by Fidelity Is maul'd to death, or merely left alive A wreck of bones. Can Prejudice say why?” 7. For all these reasons, since Simplicius thought The best companions that a man can have Are innocence and charm together brought, Fidelity, and grace, and humour grave, A bird, and cat, and dog, and bear, he bought: But kept them each apart, exclaiming—“Fiat Justitia, vivat mundus,—beast and man, too!” The special qualities he set so high at The culminating point of each pro tanto, As well as some defects he wink'd his eye at, Are faithfully set forth in our next Canto. CANTO THE SECOND.—PRACTICE. 1. Charm, in a blackbird's brazen cage confined, Was somewhat shy and wild at first of all. But to his lot the bird became resign'd, When daily to that favour'd lot did fall Fine sand, fresh water, and luxurious bits Of bullock's heart, that deck'd the cage's slits, As venison, scenting gusts that keep it pure, Hangs in the larder of an epicure; With carrots, cut in slices, eggs of ants, Maggots, and all things that a blackbird wants, For dainty relish of his daily fare. 2. Here be it said that to his first essay Simplicius, though no doubt a doctrinaire, Applied his doctrine in a general way, And prudently decided to forbear From pushing to extremes its leading principle. For, since reformers fail when they attempt At making Justice all at once invincible, He from her jurisdiction left exempt (As minor matters which he took no heed of) The grubs, and eggs, and worms, his bird had need of. The grateful Bird lived, happier day by day, A life harmonious with its lot quotidian; And, if 'twas still an elegy, his lay Had notes, at least, more joyous than Ovidian. 3. As for the fluffy, puffy, plump white Cat, If she were not completely comfortable, There surely never was a diplomat Half such a humbug, half so slyly able To simulate the feelings he should feel, And those he feels, and should not, to conceal. The chief part of her life-long holiday (As tho' it were her only care on earth To keep her soft self warm) a clump she lay Of cream-white languid limbs beside the hearth; Or rubb'd her lithe back in a flattering bow Against the legs of her good lord and master, Smoothing those spotless flakes of furry snow In which, for whiteness, not Mont Blanc surpass'd her; Or, in the firelight's fluctuating glow, Curl'd on his lap and safe from all disaster, She purr'd as tho' she to herself, half-sleeping, Were telling o'er her dreams in drowsy tone; Or else, about the chairs and tables leaping, (A frolic phantom scarcely seen ere gone) She whisk'd, and frisk'd, and flitted here and there, Fitful as fancy, and as childhood fair. 4. To these two qualities of Charm and Grace Which he in Bird and Cat together got, Simplicius added, in the third good place, Fidelity—so true, man finds it not Save in a dog. The Dog of our Simplicius Was great and good; and well deserved, poor fellow, A name less ominous of deeds flagitious Than chance had given him—say Philax, Bello, Or Lion, even, or Turk—for he was bold (Albeit without a touch of temper vicious) But Nero? . . . cramm'd with cruelties untold, Whose character was, like his name, nigritious, —A name recalling murders manifold! Such was the name this dog, by chance capricious, Had been baptised with, when, but three months old, His tender age might, sure, have guaranteed him Against the libellous title thus decreed him. 5. If pure gold, oozed from out the Age of Gold, Could, in a living form, have glow'd on earth, None better fitted to present, and hold Unsullied, its primæval perfect worth Could earth have found it, than our Nero's own; Nor more in colour kindred to the hue Whereby that noble metal may be known. For tawny-colour'd was our Nero too, As gold is: short-hair'd, all a yellow brown; Save for a single streak of glossy black That, with straightforward purpose, went right down The whole length of his honourable back, And his most eloquently honest tail; Which wagg'd warm welcome to the world all round. Black, too, and bright as brightly burnisht mail, The single star that his fair forehead crown'd, And black his muzzle was: the unshell'd snail No blacker shines, whose damp and jetty sheen Jewels the fresh stalks of the rain-drench'd fennel. When Nero, his stoop'd head flat-based between Firm-planted forepaws, peeping from his kennel, Lay stretch'd sedate in soothing noontide sleep; Whilst loyal vigilance unlull'd and keen (No sound escaping its quick silent comment) Still linger'd in the watchful tremulous wink Of drowsy lids that twitch'd at every moment, And duty sat in serious wrinkles deep Across his brow's sagacious breadth,—I think That had some Attic sculptor seen that sight, Grasping his chisel with an eager hand, He would have cried, in satisfied delight, “Behold the perfect sculpturesque expression Of Property!” And, forced to understand The imprudence of his wonted prepossession Against the law of Moses and the land, A thief, perchance, some honest awe might feel, And pass on murmuring “Thou shalt not steal!” 6. Between Fidelity, and Charm, and Grace, For Humour of a grave and thoughtful kind, In ursine form, long while a vacant place Simplicius kept before he chanced to find Its fit incumbent. For the ursine race, Whose sage demeanour and prodigious force Might with the race of man have long competed Had they but chosen to dispute man's course, Have, far from man, to hermit haunts retreated, And lone they dwell among the mountains lonely. Man boasts, as tho' the trick must needs endear him To all four-footed animals at least, That he can go upon his hind paws only. For this, and for his faculty to feast Upon all kinds of food, the beasts revere him As being the most universal beast. But in these two respects the Bear comes near him; Tho' differing in a third (and not, I fear To man's advantage) namely in good-nature. O Timon! Timon! hadst thou been a bear, Those maledictions, by a human creature On human creatures hurl'd, not even despair Would then have wrung from thy resentment. Guile, Deceit, and treachery, and treason black Bruin (for so was named in simple style This shaggy much-tried sage) had known, alack, In all their hateful human forms, long while Ere from a filthy vagrant Bosniac Simplicius bought him—unembitter'd yet, And so good-natured that across his back He let a pert and pranksome monkey get, Pretend to ride him, and, impetuous, smack A saucy whip. Himself a minuet With sad and stately gesture sometimes deign'd To dance to music rude of drum and fife, Tho' oft the mirth of vulgar crowds profaned This melancholy pastime of a life Which had known better days. Alas poor Bruin! A trustful nature and, for safe fruition, A love, too fond—of honey—proved his ruin. Rogues had imposed on his sweet disposition And made him smart for it. But Fortune now Seem'd on his fate to smile with fairer brow. Simplicius built him in the castle court A spacious mansion for his calm resort. Rail'd parapets of stone did there environ His sleeping chamber girt with grates of iron. And, in the midst of this deep-sunk domain, A dead tree, planted by man's labour fast, Served for his perch whene'er the sage was fain (Like “Science in her speculative tower”) A general glance around the world to cast, With soul unbounded by his lonely bower. 7. So in Simplicius' hospitable hall Did Grace and Charm, its daily inmates, dwell. And, round about those happy precincts, all Went blithe and “merry as a marriage bell.” The Bird “his native wood-notes warbled wild.” The Cat, like some white curl'd-up humming shell, Purr'd by the hearth contentment calm and mild. The Dog bark'd welcome loud and wagg'd delight To his approving master morn and night. And he, the blissful owner of these joys, When he, at any moment, felt inclined To meditative moods, whose charm decoys From shallower pleasures oft the pensive mind, Would sit and muse above that bear-pit wide. Whence many a mournful monitory growl With solemn music stirr'd and edified To heights sublime his contemplative soul. Sullen it was, nay surly seem'd the sound. But surly too, nor feebly feminine, Is that majestic charm by fancy found In Melancholy's deep and sullen eyne What time she doth a manly sex assume. And that is why, when either love or wine In manly bosoms breeds ungenial gloom, Chilling with churlish scowl some revel garish, We call such melancholy conduct—bearish. CANTO THE THIRD.—EXPERIENCE. 1. This pleasant life, so calm and so caressing, Was interrupted by a journey brief Simplicius, on account of business pressing, Was forced to undertake. Before the chief His castle left, he call'd into his presence An old retainer born beneath its roof, Of all domestic virtues the quintessence; A tried and trusted spirit—above proof. Whom (to secure administrative unity) With counsel carefully minute and clear He gave in charge of his beloved community, The Dog, the Cat, the Blackbird, and the Bear. 2. The business settled to his satisfaction Which drew Simplicius from his own abode, He, with a mind relieved from all distraction And full of longings, on his homeward road One evening reach'd, when it was somewhat late, The last post station. 'Twas a tiny town, But few hours distant from his own estate. But there, his horses having broken down, For fresh relays he was constrain'd to wait. Besides, a storm was coming on. So, there Resolving prudently to pass the night, He order'd rooms and supper at The Bear; A little hostel cheerful, clean, and bright, Whose landlord was postmaster of the village, A farmer, too, with land in his own tillage. 3. The candles lighted, and the clean cloth spread, The curtains drawn in cosier proximity About the smooth sheets of the snowy bed, For pure dreams shelter'd by demurest dimity; Dandling his napkin with important air The obsequious waiter offer'd to Simplicius, Proud of its length, a boastful bill of fare, And list of wines, which he declared delicious. Careless as tho' it were a begging letter Simplicius glanced it over; and, because He trusted not its pledge of viands better, He was about to order without pause A simple steak—when these words proved a whetter To his attention—‘Bear's paws, Tartar sauce.’ 4. This dish to him was quite a novel one. There is no reason that we can declare For thinking a plain beefsteak, if well done, Less good for supper than grill'd paws of bear. But man's pall'd appetite his inclination Impels to range beyond the bound precise Of what he needs for simple sustentation: And to the victims of his gourmandise Simplicius felt a forcible temptation To add (since new they were, and might be nice) Grill'd paws of bear. Just as no strange intrigue, That to the list of all his old damnations Added a new seduction, could fatigue Don Juan in his search of fresh sensations. So, for the sole dish of his lonely mess table, Simplicius order'd bear's paws, to replenish The stock of his experiences digestible, And wash'd them down with half a flask of Rhenish. The dish he chose was perfectly detestable; But still his stomach did not prove rebellious, For fancy flatter'd him that he had fed On food which might have tempted a Vitellius. In which benign belief he went to bed. 5. Near morn he dream'd a dream. He dream'd his Bear Was turn'd into a Lady, tall and stately: And dream'd that he, himself, her fingers fair With fervour kiss'd. Then, as she smiled sedately, He sigh'd “Ah madam! if you could but tell How charming, grill'd with Tartar sauce, it is, Before the altar, with your heart as well, You would on me bestow the hand I kiss!” His sleep was broken by the Postboy's horn Just as the fair dame of his dream replied Blushing, and like a lady nobly born Whose passion struggles with a modest pride, “Ah Baron, libertines such flatterers are! And trustful fools are we. Unhand me, pray! There's nothing in the world that can compare With dog, served up in honey, the new way.” 6. The sun was beaming brightly thro' the casement, Mine host had brought the coffee. From repose, Still half between amusement and amazement, Simplicius, smiling at his dream, arose: Finish'd his breakfast: lighted his cigar: And sprang into his carriage, quite elate. He knew his own good mansion was not far. A few hours brought him to the castle gate. 7. He cross'd the court, surprised and somewhat sadden'd That Nero, faithful guardian of his hall, With no gay bark his silent entry gladden'd. Nor came the good dog to his master's call. But more, anon, that master's heart was grieved When, to him coming o'er the cloister'd flags, His agèd Major Domo he perceived With palsied head bound up in bloody rags. And “Ah my lord,” the old man cried, “alas! Alas, and woe the day!”—“Why, honest Andrew, Why such affliction? What hath come to pass?” Only a heavy sigh that agèd man drew. “What mean those bloody bandages?”—“Dear master,” The old man whimper'd with a whine of woe, “My hair's clean gone in that accurst disaster, And to my grave I in a wig must go.” 8. “Man, what disaster?”—“O, the Bird, the Bird!” “What bird? and what has happen'd? tell me what?” Simplicius cried by sad forebodings stirr'd, “And O the Cat,” groan'd Andrew, “O the Cat!” Then on he rambled, all ejaculation, “O, my good master! O, my hair! my hair! And O, the Dog!” With rising agitation “The dog?” exclaim'd Simplicius. “And the Bear, The Bear!” groan'd Andrew. “What a situation!” “Quick!” cried his master, “all the truth declare.” Then, drop by drop as 'twere, this sad narration Oozed from the depths of the old man's despair. 9. Andrew, the moment that his lord was gone, Had yielded to a wish long while represt, A wild emotion ever and anon Haunting good servants—to disturb their rest, And, more, their master's. For so fine a border Between extremes is in this planet scurvy, That when they want to set the house in order Your servants always turn it topsy-turvy. The house, in this case, was the bird's house merely; But much the bird disliked that innovation. And we ourselves, who have experienced yearly The same conditions, and the same sensation, Can understand the bird's bewilder'd rage. Retreating restlessly, without success, From one nook to another of his cage, He tried to escape that demon, Cleanliness; And at the last, his incommoded premises Deserting altogether, forth he flew. But that desertion the avenging Nemesis Of violated custom did pursue. Infatuating freedom more and more Confused his soul, already in confusion; And now against the ceiling, now the floor, He flounced with flop, and flutter, and contusion; Flew bounce against the cornice of the door, Then, clamorous, at the casement's cold delusion Which mock'd him (since for him they waved no more) With sight of waving woods in wild profusion. At length he turn'd to books for consolation, And o'er the bookcase perch'd in Gothic gloom. Andrew, bewilder'd too, took that occasion To hasten to the pantry for a broom. But when, with this new engine of persuasion, He to the chase return'd,—alas o'erpowering (As well it might be) was his consternation To find the Cat (more quick than he) devouring The last few bloody feathers of the Bird. 10. “Beast!” cried Simplicius, when the story came To this sad point, and by resentment stirr'd He rose in haste, “I'll bring her to the scratch!” “Alas, my lord,” old Andrew cried with shame, “That's what I tried. But cats are hard to catch. I hurl'd my broomstick, like a javelin, at her: She thro' the door, left open, darted: hard Behind her, down the stairs with cry and clatter, I after: and so out across the yard. This Nero saw: and judged the Cat in fault. Nor judged he wrong. The little murderess fled; But Nero (honest dog) still barking ‘halt’ Fleet on her sly and felon footsteps sped. Poor Puss! . . . He meant it for the best . . . and yet— ’Twixt dog and cat there's ancient feud ’tis said, Like that between my lords of Capulet And Montague, of which in books I've read. But I'll believe not that our Nero's breast Lodged hate like theirs—or any hate at all. Too good was he! He meant it for the best. The Cat had sprung upon the Bear-pit's wall. The Dog sprang after. With a gallant grip He pinn'd her by the throat, and . . . squeak!”— “The brute!” Simplicius cried, “but he shall feel my whip. Go, fetch it!” Andrew, melancholy mute, Turn'd, brush'd his hand across his eyes, and said “Nero will never feel the whip again.” 11. The old man sigh'd profoundly, shook his head, And then resumed. “Regrets and threats are vain. O what a sight! methinks I see it yet. The Cat was down. The Dog above her stood. But both were struggling on the parapet. The Cat's white coat was red with clots of blood, With blood the Dog's black muzzle. And meanwhile, Perch'd on his pole, the Bear this conflict eyed; Smiling, as well as such a brute can smile, And wagg'd his hideous head from side to side. His paws, with an atrocious affectation, Cross'd loose and languid o'er his bulky breast, His small eyes, all unwonted animation, Glowing expectant with a greedy zest. And all this time the monster humm'd with pleasure, And all this time the moment's helpless dread Crippled me like a paralytic seizure. The Cat, at last, lay still. I deem'd her dead. Is there a second Cat-world, as I'm fain To hope, where cats redeem'd, without relapse, By birds untempted, and by dogs unslain, Live and do better? Pardon'd there, perhaps, Each sinful puss may yet to peace attain. Else why earth's torturing trials, dogs, guns, traps? Whilst thus I mused, up sprang the Cat again, And dealt the Dog a buffet in the chaps. That was her dying effort. In surprise The Dog set up a howl—recoil'd—slipp'd—fell Into the pit—I turn'd away mine eyes, And what I could not see I cannot tell. It overcomes me. Never to that wall My looks are turn'd without a pang of pain. He was a dog who, take him all in all, We shall not look upon his like again.” 12. And, since the old man's utterance fail'd him, here Stepp'd, cap in hand, the Keeper from the clan Of listening servants who had gather'd near, And “Save your lordship's presence,” he began, “'Tis too much for the old one. Let him be. More bravely then, my lord, himself he bore. Three skips into the house to find the key, And down the stairs again in three skips more. Next moment in old Bruin's den was he. Ay, without fear! without his hat, too. Well, Meanwhile there rested nothing but a ruin Of broken bones to mark where Nero fell, And these the Bear was mumbling. ‘Bruin! Bruin! Bruin, you brute!’ cried Andrew. Bruin stopp'd Mouthing the mangled morsels of poor Nero Which leisurely with surly calm he dropp'd, And Lord! my heart sank in me down to zero When I beheld him on his hind legs stalking (As proud as any Christian, please your lordship) And, with a growl of beastly rage, half walking Half reeling, as we landsmen do aboard ship, Up to the old one.”—“Shoot him!” groan'd Simplicius. The Keeper nodded, “That's already done. For I was there. I knew the brute was vicious, And with me, by good luck, I had my gun. 'Twas plaguy hard to aim, tho', 'twixt the pair o' them, Bruin's black waistcoat, Master Andrew's blue one— Hard to see which the man, and which the bear, o' them— Half hid by both, one small white spot—the true one— No bigger than a button. Well, I cover— Fire—and three fall—Andrew, the Bear, and I. Ay, ay! 'twas not my gun that kick'd me over. My heart went thump, and that I'll not deny. When I came round, my wife says, like a dumb thing I stared about, and whiter than a cheese. Good reason, too! I knew I had kill'd something, The Bear or Andrew—one, or both of these. 'Twas Andrew luckily—I mean, 'twas he My shot had saved. The Bear was dead as mutton. My ball was in him just where it should be, In that white spot no bigger than a button. 13. “Ay, dead and done! But 'faith! in his last jigs He scalp'd the old one clean as Indians do; And that's why Andrew talks of wearing wigs, Forgetting he was bald ten years ago. But since that day the old one's just” . . . And here The keeper slowly lifted to his forehead A furtive finger. Lost in musings drear “Ah,” sigh'd Simplicius, “it is all too horrid!” Then, with a vacant dreamy air, as one Whose thoughts are vext by the interposition Of some vague memory that's come and gone Before it finds within him recognition, “What with the carcass of the Bear was done?” 14. The Keeper answer'd “With my lord's permission, ‘A badger's half a sort of bear,’ said I. The badger is the Keeper's perquisite, And, deeming thus the Bear mine own, for why? I shot him, nor could bear be better hit, I skinn'd the beast. His grease I melted down. The barbers bought it. For next winter's cold His fur I kept. And in the market town His venison to a poulterer I sold.” “Heavens!” groan'd Simplicius, and against his brow He struck his fist. For now the truth flash'd clear, And he remorsefully remember'd how He had eaten his own bear's paws at The Bear. 15. The Cat had eaten up the Bird: ere she In turn, a victim, to the Dog had pass'd. The Bear had feasted on the Dog: and he, Horror, had feasted on the Bear at last! Thus he who, for their orgies too carnivorous, Against Cat, Dog, and Bear had just protested Was proved (from such injustice Saints deliver us!) To have both eaten, relish'd, and digested The Bear, and, with the Bear, the Bear's own dinner, Bird, Cat, and Dog, besides—vicarious sinner! He gazed around him with a rueful eye That miss'd each loved and lately murder'd quality. In fancy he beheld the Blackbird die; The Cat a victim to the Dog's brutality; The Dog devour'd by the Bear; and by Himself the Bear, with Roman sensuality Of stomach audax omnia perpeti! And, seeing too, no fancy but reality, The scalp'd pate of his mangled Major Domo, “Fiat justitia,” groan'd he, “pereat homo!” XXX. THE ROCK. 1 For ages standing, still for ages stood (To stand and to withstand was all his care) A Rock: whose feet were in the unfathom'd flood, His forehead in the illimitable air. Upon his brow the centuries beat, And left it, as they found it, bare; The rolling waters round his feet Roll'd, and roll'd otherwhere. 2 And those cold feet of his the fawning waves Lick'd, slave-like, ever with a furtive sigh; Save when at times they rose, and (still like slaves) In rebel scum, with insubordinate cry, Strove, and, tho' fiercely, strove in vain To drag down him that stood so high; Then fell; and at his feet again Fawn'd—with a furtive sigh. 3 The Storm and he were brothers; but in feud. One lived a station'd, one a wandering, life: This to subdue, that to be unsubdued, Put forth his strength in unfraternal strife. The burden of one weary brother Was to resist, and to remain: A fiercer fate impell'd the other To strive, and strive in vain. 4 A homeless wanderer over the wide world, A sullen spirit with a fleeting form, That pass'd in soil'd and tumid mantle furl'd, For ever and for ever roam'd the Storm. But o'er the sea, with shoulders bent And backward scowl before the blast, He, flying, to his discontent Beheld the Rock stand fast; 5 And lingering hover'd, restless, round and round, To vex the rest that vex'd him. But the Rock, Beaten and buffeted, yet not uncrown'd, Stood, and withstood; and sadly seem'd to mock The Force which cries from age to age In accent fierce “Give way!” With that which, ignorant of rage, For ever answers “Nay!” 6 Then stoop'd the Storm, and whisper'd to the waves, “Are ye so many, and afraid of one? The world is yours, if ye but knew, poor slaves! Dare to be lords, and lo, the world is won!” To that wild tempter's whisper rose Their hundred heads, soon dasht in spray; But these succeeding fast to those Renew'd the frustrate fray; 7 Until the Storm could lift the waves no higher; Then, with a scornful sigh letting them fall, And self-pursued by unappeased desire, He left them, as he found them, slaves. And all That strife without result for ever Ends only to begin again; Subsiding but for fresh endeavour, Eternal, yet in vain. 8 But, in the intervals of time, among The fissures of the Rock, have birds of prey Built themselves nests: who, fishing for their young, Dive in the waves, and snatch the fish away. And heaven its feather'd generations Renews to vex from year to year The sea's folk, as their scaly nations Appear, and disappear. 9 The fishes needs must suffer and endure, Unable to retaliate on the birds; And of their fishy wrongs which find no cure The wide-mouth'd fools complain in watery words, “Hath Providence for pasture given The weak for ever to the strong? Is there no justice, then, in Heaven? No sense of right and wrong?” 10 The Storm (that never leaves it long at rest) Return'd anon to trouble the still sea, But that eternal revolutionist Seem'd to these short-lived sufferers to be A young deliverer, waited long, Whom, in the fulness of late time, Heaven raised to rectify the wrong, And punish prosperous crime. 11 And when the devastating waves roll'd high, And drave the birds, and drench'd their dwellings thro', The fishes cried, exulting, “Verily There is a judge that judgeth just and true! The judgment day hath dawn'd at last: Now strikes the final judgment hour: The future shall redeem the past, And lift the poor to power!” 12 The Rock stood fast—tho' bare of nest and bird: The Storm was spent: the sunk sea ceased from striving, And, in the stillness, that grey hermit heard This fuss of exultation and thanksgiving. The water trickled from his wet Wave-ravaged crest, and dripp'd below, As, after battle, drops the sweat Down from a hero's brow. 13 “Is it for this,” within him mused the strong And melancholy spirit of his life, “For this, that I stand here — who knoweth how long, Who knoweth wherefore?—in eternal strife! And gaze into the nether deep And up to heaven's huge hollowness, And, while the ages o'er me sweep, Question the void abyss, 14 “Sad, yet supreme; and weary, yet awake! And must I listen still, and still must hear, How of a final judgment—for their sake— (Their sake, who but appear to disappear!) These sprats and sparrows gurgle and twitter?” So mused the Rock; his gray Bare summit redden'd by the glitter Of the departing day. 15 And, whilst he mused, athwart the trembling plain His shade, unnoticed, sped with stealthy flight Far on the dim horizon to attain The obscurely safe asylum of the night; As tho', for once, unvext, unview'd, That Rock's soul fain would be From the eternal solitude Of his own greatness free. 16 But greatness grants to greatness no escape. Fierce on the timorous vagrant's furtive track The sudden sunrise flashing smote this shape Of baffled darkness to its birthplace back; And there, where Splendour seem'd to mock Its slave whose flight was vain, Deep in his own brave heart the Rock Buried his shade again. XXXI. DEMOS. PART 1. When Light first dawn'd, to Chaos came repose: Shapes, from te sheeted shapelessness unfurl'd, Took rank in order ranged: the Mountains rose, And found themselves the monarchs of the world. The sunrise, bearing tribute, all night long Travell'd the globe, and brought them eastern gold Daily at earliest dawn. Bright breastplates strong The skill's frost forged them of white-colour'd cold. Round their firm thrones sharp lightnings flash'd like swords, And guarding thunders girt teir crowns. The plain Bore, in fond homage to his highborn lords, The floating purple of their princely train. Forest, to deck their pomp, with forest vied, Mantled, and clasp'd them round with emerald zones; Whilst dainty lawns spread broider'd carpets wide O'er all the soft approaches to their thrones, For easy kneeling. Clouds, like stately cares That haunt the sombre foreheads of the great, Burthen'd their browns. But eagles, too, were theirs, That eyed the sun undazzled, and elate As bold ambitions in imperial minds. To earth'd far frontiers, bearing banner'd shower And blowing solemn trump, the winged winds, Their wandering heralds, did proclaim their power. The fertile rivers, and fresh streams, were fed On the rich bounty of their royal grace. Each rebel billow at their feet fell dead. They were creation's cronw'd and sceptred race. But, scorn'd, obscure, down trampled in the dirt And miry drench of their dark hollows, lay Unable to uplift himself—inert, And lacking nobel form—te lumpish Clay. And to himself the Clay said “Trodden down, Here in abasement must I bear their scorn Who, glittering with a glory not their own, Boast of the accident of being born In lofty station? Fasion'd were we both Of the same substance, gender'd from the womb Of the same mother; and shall theirs, forsooth, Be all the glory, and all mine the gloom? 'Twere better not to be, than to be thus, Earth'd common footstool. Better not to live Than to live under lorddom tyrannous, Strong to dendure, but impotent to strive? Yet must I hide me, and my wrongs, away, Till strike mine hour. And strike it will. Meanwhile, Patince, be thou my prophet?” And the Clay Slunk from the sun's unsympaathising smile, And roll'd himself into the river's bed, And there lay hidden. Time pass'd, Man appear'd, And laid his hnad on Nature. For his bread The glebe was harrown'd, and the forest clear'd. He turn'd, and tamed, the torrent to his will: Bridged the broad river, fell'd the flourishing oak: Groped in the granit bowels of the hill For hidden ore: and rent with flame and smoke The ribs of royal mountains. Dwon they came, Shorn by the saw, and measured by the rod, To build man's palaces, and bear his name Carved in their flesh. The earth had a new god. PART II. Large was the chamber; bathed with light serene And silence tuned, not troubled, by the sound Of one cool fountain tinkling in the green Of laurel groves that girt the porches round. And in that chamber the sole dwellers were Ideas, clad in clear and stately shape; Save one, a prisoner, huge, uncouth, and bare, Hung fast in fetters, hopeless of escape, And broken at the heart,—a Marble Block. Even as a hero, in base ambuscade Fallen; so, fall'n, and from his native rock Borne here in chains, the indignant Marble made No moan; but round, in dumb remonstrance gazed; And, gazing, saw, surprised, all round him stand The images of gods. With right arm raised, Jove lauch'd the thunders from his loaded hand: A light of undulating lovelinesses, Rose foam-born Venus from the foam: and, dread With dismal beauty, by its serpent tresses Did sworded Perseus lift Medusa's head: There paused a-tiptoe wing-capp'd Mercury: Apollo, pensive smiling, linger'd here: There stately Pallas stood, with brooding eye, Full arm'd, and grasp'd the ægis and the spear. A kindred instinct flash'd, a sudden glow Thrill'd, sparkling, through the Marble's crystal gain. “Flesh of my flesh,” he cried, “I know you now, You stately statues! and myself would fain Be also even as ye are.”—“After me!” A mocking voice made answer from below. “Wretch!” laugh'd the lucid Marble, “after thee?” For, not far off, he notice, by a row Of pitchers, huddled in a slimy trough, The lumpish Clay. “Baseborn, how darest thou show Thy face in Beauty's sanctuary ? Off! Did not I banish thee when I” . . . “When thou Thyself wast yet unbanisht, wouldst thou say? True! in try pride thou couldst not then foresee The hour when me thou must perforce obey. For thou will have to obey me.”—“Obey thee?” “Ay! grinding they gnasht teeth against the fine Keen flitting chisel, when thy nature stern Must needs submit to serve each fluent line My form imposes on it; that, in turn, Thou mayst, by following me, be something.”—“I? I follow thee, wretch?”—“Ho! not broken yet Is thy proud spirit? Patience! By and by Thou, too, wilt need, as I have needed, it.” PART III. The Artist strode into the statued hall, Up to the block; and, with pleased eyes perused The Marble's snowy sides, slow measuring all The length and breadth of them. The while he mused, Into the stone, with such intense regard, His deep gaze dived, that in a mystic thrill It felt his human eye, throughout its hard And frozen bulk, with a creative will Awakening beauteous forms in slumber claspt, Which heaved as tho'd that will they half foreknew. Sudden, he stretch'd his searching hand, and grasp'd . . . —Ah strange! 'Twas not the Chisel that now flew Dartlike, obedient to that aiming eye, Into the heart of the expectant stone. His Thought plunged, kneading, in the trough hard by, And clods of viscous Clay, one after one, Thick on the table thump'd with clumsy thud: There, grew together: wormlike writhing, rose Pliant to every touch: until the mud, Gliding and glutinous, 'gan half disclose The thought that quicken'd it. Its impish speed Was half, like Caliban, ungainly, half, Like Ariel, delicate, till Fancy freed Her image struggling from it. With low laught “Seest thou?” it lisp'd and mutter'd. “Seest thou? Try To follow me now; and mine image take Upon thee. Which of us hath (I or thou) The fine creative faculty to make Ideas first corporeal?” And, complete In clay, a statute stood before the gaze Of the astonisht Marble. Then, to eat Slowly, and gnaw through all the intricate maze Of netted lines about his body thrown, The griding chisel, with three-corner'd wedge, Ground his keen tooth upon the spluttering stone Which sprang and split in sparkles round the edge, Driven by the dancing mallet. By degrees The out-thrust throat and formidable face Assume imperative purpose: fingers seize And grasp the fluttering scrollwith eager grace: The deep eye darkens under beetling brows: The half-uplifted arm begins to shake The toga's massive fold, that backward flows: And the stretcht finger points. What worlds awake Upon those quivering lips? What thunder-speech Up heaves the fierce Democarcy, and breaks The power of pale Patricians cowering each From that curl'd lip? For lo, the Tribune speaks! The Tribune? O proud Marble, royal born, Thou the coarse organ of the Demos? thou! “Art thou enough humiliated, Scorn? Pride, is thy loftiness at last brought low?” The base material, to the nobler one Form'd after its own image, sneer'd. “By Me, And after me! 'This thus, and thus alone, That, pround one, thou henceforth hast leave to be.” But te pure Marble, in the image clothed Of a new power, still conscious to the last Of all his ancient force, made answer “Loathed Abortive botch! A granted garb thou hast, But think not thou art safe in it. `By thee?' Through thee, say rather: who hast now made known Undream'd of means, and mightier ones, to me of being above thee. Look, fool, one thine own Futile and perishable frame. Behold! Already runs the gaping fissure straight From head to heel. For all thy boasting bold, They tottering limbs can scarce support the weight Of thy flaw's body; and thy flimsy flesh Hastily put together, may not long Uphold thy silly head. Some crevice fresh Is daily widening those loose clods among. Drunk with the fancied triumph of a day, Thou staggerest. Me, superior still, thou must Invoke to represent thee. Baseborn Clay, Slave of the immortal Marble, sink—in dust!” XXXII. A PROMETHEUS UNBOUND. “Ich unglücksel'ger Atlas!”—Heinrich Heine. Me miserable Atlas! `Twas the lot of a cork in a bottle, (Who, bound with wire, and wound with twine, Was a prisoner himself, held fast by the throttle) To imprison a generous wine. And oh, pround, how proud of his lot was he, The oppressor of the that strong spirit to be! But alas for the chance of power, And the ups and downs of a ruler's life! For once, in a festal hour, Somebody suddenly seizing a knife, (This happen'd on board of a ship at sea) Cut asunder the bonds which till then had held fast That cork to his boasted place. Then at last The fiery force in the flask, set free And upshooting a foamy fountain, tost The bung from the bottle, and overboard. And thus was his proud supremacy lost, When sustain'd no longer by steel and cord. “Revolution!” that was the cork's first word, As splash! he fell on his flimsy pate. “Such another the universe never will see. What a greatness there is in the fall of the great! O what an uprising—and all against me! And, ye gods! what a strength was mine, so long To have held in subjection a spirit so strong!' Whilst thus he was speaking, o'er him descended (Taking him suddenly captive again) A broken kettle, too bad to be mended, Which the ship's cook happen'd to pitch just then Out of the cabin-windown. It fell Inclosing the cork like a diving-bell; And souse, together both cork and can Sunk to the bed of the ocean. There, in the dismal abyss, through chasms Of the scoriac crust of the dædal earth, The central fire with volcanic spasms Was hurling upward in monstrous mirth Mighty masses of burning stone. “Thou, too, O Earth,” cried the cork with a groan, “Art overwhelm'd by rebellious powers Jealous of majesty mighty as ours! Well, such is the fate, as it seems of the great In these bag times, my Royal Brother! There is something wrong in the universe. I myself, as thou seest, have suffer'd reverse. One fallen grandeur can feel for another.” Meanwhile, that irruption submarine Was belching granite into the brine; And the split stones, tumbling heavy and hot, Buried beneath them cork and pot. The former his inborn levity, And natural disposition to keep On the surface (being restrain'd thereby) Made ill at ease in his dungeon deep. And he said, with a self-compassionate sigh, “The last of the Titan race am I, Titanic suffere! Envious Fate, Of how heavy a world of woes they hate, Hath made me Atlas!” That dark Power Whose unseen finger fashions the hour, And guides blind Chance to her destined work, Heard this complaint of the querulous cork; And, smiling a secret smile of contempt, Scatter'd the stones that imprison'd him: Who, as soon as he found himself thus exempt From external pressure, up thro' the dim Vague and voluminous element Wavering back to the surface went. There did ht eligh-headed loiterer roll From ripple to ripple, without a goal; Vacant of power and purpose too; Drifting, shifting, with nothing in view. Hither and thither the waters drew him: This way, that way, the breezes blew him: Fishes snapp'd at him now and then, Half-swallow'd and spat him out again: Whilst, restored to his own inherent want Of stability, ever he lightly glided (As wave and wind were predominant) On the course by his chance—not choice—decided. O Atlas! what of thy Titan doom, Thine ocean-shround, and thy mountain-tomb? Flimsy fragment of fungus stuff, Too flimsy to perish, drift on still! For in thee is not even weight enough To dive, and be drown'd, of thine own free will. XXXIII. VALOUR. 1 For free discussion of affairs of state The Beasts a public meting held: and there 'Twas sad to her how things had lapsed of late From bad to worse, and so degenerate were That now the greatest rascals wer the great. In fact the talk was such as everywhere, Is heard at public meetings nowadays, Where those who give most censure get most praise. 2 An Ape, much cheer'd (he chatter'd like a man) Denounced the weakness of the government. “Where shall we find true valour?” he began. “Not in the craven crew we are content To call our leaders. Let him lead who can! Old Kingdoms tempt new conquerors. Prevent The impending ruin of this empire old! Tho' big, the brutes that lead us are not bold. 3 “Or only bold to weaker beasts are they. There is not one of them (and that they know) Who never yet was forced to slink away, Avoiding fight with some superior foe. But as for that, what need of leaders, pray? Since turning tail's a trick we all can do. True Valour flies not, tho' the foe be strong, Nor works, by force or fraud, another's wrong; 4 “True Valour neither seeks nor shuns to fight. Be his the royal crown, and his alone, In whom true Valour doth those gifts unite Which guard a nation and endear a throne!” The meeting would have echo'd with delight The Ape's discourse, if, ere the Ape was done, The Lion had not suddenly appear'd; Whose presence was impressive, tho' uncheer'd. 5 He rose, and round him roll'd a regnant eye; Calmly contemptuous was his ample brow; And “What is it ye want!” he said. “If I, The Lion, be not valorous enow, Where's he, so valorous, that he dares defy My power, forsooth unprized, I fain would know? Is not my presence fear'd by those ye fear? What more protection need ye? I am here. 6 “Peace, babbling mouths! Not mine the fault, but theirs, If, trusting neither in themselves nor me, Those poor poltroons, quails, pigeons, rabbits, hares, In panic flight to soon from danger flee. The foe that slays the coward unawares Is his own coward heart's timidity. Whose presence have I ever shunn'd? or who Hath seen me shrink, or” . . . “Cock-a-doole-do!” 7 And Doole-do!” again the red Cock cried. It is an old popular belief that the lion cannot bear the crow of the cock. Schiller alludes to it in his Wallensteins Lager. the sergeant says of the great Friedlander—“. . . When the cock crows he starts thereat.” To which the Jäger replies—He's one and the same with the lion in that.” The Lion, with disgust beyond control, Shrugg'd his huge mane—shrank—falter'd—turn'd aside, That vulgar voice, impertinently droll, Offensive to his taste as to his pride, Set smarting in his sensitive strong soul A secret nerve that found there no defence From the coarse touch of clumsy insolence. 8 “There goes the bravest of the brave! put out, Crow'd down!” the bald Ape jabber'd to the crowd. The Bull, scarce knowing what 'twas all about, With sullen stare half stupid and half pround Had seen the dunghill bird, and heard him shout, Heedless; but, while the hubbub wax'd more loud, Close in the ear of him a crafty Crow Cried, “Seize the monet, ere the moment go! 9 “The throne is vacant. Claim and take it, thou! Address the people!” urged the black-robed bird. “Or let me be thine orator. I know The habits and the humours of the Herd.” Then round the field he flew; to high and low Persuasive spake, and counsell'd all who heard To choose a bovine king. “For see,” he said, “What simple tastes, and what a solid head! 10 “Mark, too, how great a following is his! Whose Party follows him where'er he goes. What confidence! and how deserved it is! On party strength well-balanced States repose. And how respectable a party this! Republics only ripen public woes To fatten despots. But can aught surpass Sound Bourgeois Rule, with bellyfuls of grass?” 11 These words the opinion of the public win. the cautious Stag, persuaded, plumps his vote: The Stallion'd high-bred ear at once takes in What takes in him too: he gregarious Goat And ruminating Ram their numerous kin Lead to the poll; and each loud-bleating throat Proclaims invested with supreme authority The Bull, by right of popular majority. 12 The Fox mark'd this with ill-contented mind. He and the crow are rivals in their trade; Attorneys both of pettifogging kind. hovering about the Herd, the Crow hath made From what its foolish followers drop behind A pretty profit; by no means afraid To pick from nastiness appropriate food. Nothing's too nasty to do some one good. 13 Quite otherwise is Lawyer Reynard's way. Respectable and prosperous corporations He hates and shuns; seeks geese that go astray; Haunts backyards favouring nightly visitations; Estates ill-managed, fortunes in decay, These are his interests, these his occupations. Sound bourgeois rule he cannot bear at all: Reynard's romantic and a radical. 14 “Fine doings!” mused he, “curse that prattlign Crow! A sovereign ox, with corvine ministers? Not yet, not people, are we sunk so low If I can help it! Patience, civie sirs! Better the Lion! he at least knew how To treat affairs as only grand seigneurs Are able,—on a large and liberal scale, Not stooping to contemptible detail. 15 “He knew the world, and took it as it is, Nor ask'd five legs of mutton from a sheep. Unpinn'd to prim respectabilities, Thro' many an awkward case he's let me creep, And stopp'd the cackle of accusing geese; Quashing the trial with a sovran sweep Of his capacious and imprial paw. A king was he, whose kingly word was law! 16 “Nor cared he for a wee mouse more or less. In battle, we shall ne'er behold his peer. He wanted parliamentary address, And that's a pity; could not bear, `tis clear, The slightest interruption. Who would guess The voice of any vulgar chanticleer Could crow him down? Well, he and I were cronies, But his day's done now. Fuimus leones! 17 “As for the Bull, well know I where to find The heel of that Achilles! Wait awhile, And then you'll see the dance begin! What kind Of cant is this that fills my veins with bile, Of royal power with civic rights combined! Preach it to fleas, and bugs, and such canaille! True Valour claims no corporation-clause, But stands complete upon it own four paws.” 18 Thus musing, Master Reynard slipp'd away By devious by-paths to a secret lair Whre many a plot he had been wont to lay. There now the rascal crouch'd and sniff'd the air Till what he sought he found;—a certain gay And greedy Gadfly, buzzing here and there About a heap of carrion slyly stow'd By paws felonious in that dark abode. 19 “'Tis well to have a friend in every class, And now and then be civil to small fry,” The rogue laugh'd, lolling in the long dry grass; And, having whisper'd to her, watch'd the Fly With zealous hum about his business pass. Then, sure of the result, indifferently He saunter'd after to the grazing ground, And, like a casual lounger, look'd around. 20 The Crow, meanwhile, with a triumphant caw, Was leading up the loyal deputation Charged to present the crown, expound the law, And hail the elected monarch of the nation. the Bull, with unconcern his subjects saw, But, graciously acception their ovation, Stoop'd, to receive the crown, his stolid head; When lo! he shook, he shrank, he turn'd, he fled. 21 He fled! hsi eye, bewilder'd, sought all round Some unseen formidable foe: he fled Just in the crowning moment: fled uncrown'd: Without the least word of dismissal said To his amazed admirers. On the ground Stamping, and butting with an aimless head, Off scamper'd, with him, all his Party too. Tho' why, or where, not one of them quite knew. 22 “There goes the second of the Sons of Fame!” the scall'd Ape snicker'd to the gaping crowd. “Did not I tell you? they are all the same! Like this Goliath by a Gadfly cow'd, a swarm of Bees Sir Bruin overcame. Each hath his master, look he ne'er so proud. Again I ask—look round you left and right, Where is the chief incapable of flight?” 23 “I know the chief that never fled; and know, Where now he dwells, the bravest of the brave!” This voice came, sudden, from a wither'd bought Where perch'd in pomp a Parot gray and grave. Much had he travell'd' much with high and low Had mix'd; and learn'd the world; and seem'd to have In every land where he had been a ranger The world's respect: half citizen, half stranger. 24 Seldom he spake. Much given to thought he seem'd. No public office had he ever held; But, when he oped his beack, all listeners deem'd That they had heard an oracle of eld. Sedate his mien; and all his language teem'd With sage enigmas: none its menaing spell'd: All praised it mor efor that. So judgments go. Omne ignotum pro magnifico! 25 Yet was this Parrot (the plain truth to own) At bottom an impostor, rake, and kanve; Who in himself had selfishly lived down That love of freedom born in bosoms brave; Which he regarded as the cause and crown Of all the ills that mortal life enslave. “For what's life worth,” he thought, “if day by day The worth of life wear life itself away? 26 “The tree that's not contented to be wood Doth all its strength to its own damage put, In bringing forth what brings the tree no good; Since others pluck the apple and the nut, And each fool's toil but turns him into food For other mouths, whose greed its gettigns glut. Why plague one's sould, a plaguy world to please? Life's only fruit worth growing is life's ease. 27 “Per Bacco!” (He had been in Italy) “Give me the golden cage that I can quit Whene'er I will because men know that I, No fool, am sure to turn again to it! Caramba!” (and in Spain) “where'er I fly I find but folk that seem for Bedlam fit. Oh, que les bêtes sont bêtes!” (and he had been In France, where things worth seeing he had seen: 28 Republics one and indivisible, But more than one, and all divided; ending In master-strokes of state, whereby they fell; And empires that were peace, on war depending; And constitutions that for shot and shell Were constituted marks, when past all mending; Cooks, captains, orators, mobs, proclamations, And demi-worlds for demi-reputations). 29 “Oh, que les bêtes sont bêtes! 'Tis pitiable! Cannot they see how easily mankind May be enslaved by any beast that's able, With just a show of serving men, to bind Men to its bestial service? Stall and stable Where cow and horse their cared-for comfort find, What beast but man would build for horse and cow? Or in their service sweat his boasted brow? 30 “And all for what? a little milk from one; Or leave the other's body to bestride, Who in man's seeming service (which is none) Doth only what his pleasure 'tis, and pride, To do when free—trot, gallop, leap, and run! For me, the fools a glittering house provide, That's finer than their own, a dome of gold, Because I call them bitter names, and scold! 31 “Cospetto! and what brainless brutes be these Who seek a master simply to be free! When they might get them, if they did but please, A servant, whose sole business it would be To emancipate them from the miseries Of freedom!” Perch'd upon his wither'd tree Whilst thus the Parrot mused, the Beasts below him Roar'd, “Lead us to our leader! name him! show him!” 32 “He!” the grey mocker slowly made reply, “The bravest of the brave, whose name ye ask, Retired he dwells, in that obscurity Which ofttimes wraps the unrequited task True Merit ever is content to ply. For Fame is but a hollow-sounding mask Which to the crowd reëchoes its own voice, And thence comes praise or blame, by chance, not choice. 33 “Retired he dwells: remote, serene, alone: Firm as the far-off rock where he abides: Calm, tho' around him stormy waters roll: No base ambition in his soul resides: By force or fraud, he wrongs not any one: Yet never, never, whatsoe'er betides, Doth flinch a hair's-breadth from the fiercest foe.” “Long live our leader!” roar'd the Beasts below. 34 “His name! his name!” The Parrot from the tree Perch'd on whose blighted bough he sat sedate With curious scrutiny observed the glee Of those beneath him; slowly scratch'd his pate; Rough'd all his feathers; seemed, awhile, to be O'erwhelm'd in thought profound, deliberate As one who weighs each word against objection; Then answer'd, with emphatic circumspection, 35 “Are ye resolved (think once and twice again!) To test true valour by the trial set To those whose vaunted valour ye disdain, And hold him bravest of the brave, who yet By force, or fraud, hath never spoil'd, or slain, Another; but whom never foeman, met In fiercest fight, hath ever forced to flee?” “Speak to the point!” the crowd cried. “Who is he? 36 “Name him! where is he? question us no more! 'Tis thee we question. Give us plain replies. He, only he, is worthy to reign o'er Those who to Valour have decreed the prize!” The rest was one enthusiastic roar. A twinkle glitter'd in the wily eyes Of that grey trifler, whilst for prudent flight He spread his wings, and scream'd, with grim delight, 37 “Ridiculous and cowardly canaille! Who jeer and flout the fine infirmities Of noble minds! whose natures mean and vile The Lion's courage, the Bull's strength despise, And sneer at all ye cannot reconcile With trite decorums! who can claim your prize? No creature ever known to run or royster. Ye bid me name your chief? I name the Oyster!” XXXIV. PAIN. 1 Satan, the Prince of Pain, whose rebel wing Creation cages under golden bars, Wander'd his world-wide penthouse, hovering Among the mazy courses of the stars, And mock'd the music of the spheres: “Beat time To the dull march of Matter's doom'd routine, Mechanics of Creation! ye are mine, Tho' me you praise not with your patient chime.” 2 Fierce cries of anguish mixt with shouts of mirth Rose as he spake. The Rebel Angel laugh'd “I know that music. 'Tis the babbling Earth Still to mine ears the self-same song doth waft. Old is each note of it. Complaints and curses! Murder and robbery in all forms of life, And dust, for dust, with dust in endless strife; Princes for provinces, and pads for purses! 3 “Creatures of crocodile-creating clay, Think ye your croaking, or your crunching, worth Satanic intervention? Have your way, You self-made victims of the vulgar Earth! But long live Love, in whose light air-balloon Faith soars to heaven, self-confident and vain, And falls with broken limbs to earth again, Cursing her madcap voyage to the moon! 4 “The good old classic music! Passion quench'd In hissing tears. Fond greed of fancied gain That sinks in sight of port. The fist fierce-clench'd That strikes the despot brow it served in vain. Thought's shamed confession ‘Unattainable!’ Affection's lamentation ‘Lost!’ Hope's moan ‘Defeated!’ Effort's deathcry ‘Overthrown!’ Well done, ye faithful servitors of Hell! 5 “I recognise your work, and give it praise.” And the Dark Spirit smiled. But suddenly Was wafted to him, from within that maze Of miserable sounds, a single sigh; So faint, it scarce divided the vext air More than a silence; yet of such strange pain As waked the past in Satan's soul again, And thrill'd with memory his immense despair. 6 He, spreading sullen pinions, earthward bent Swift flight; to find the archer whose strong bow The torment of its venom'd shaft had sent Into such endless distances of woe. There, scarce perceptible, the Fiend perceived A little saucy Imp, whose fingers fine Held with affected languor feminine A bunch of fresh-blown roses, dewy-leaved. 7 And from this posy now and then he took A single rose; and with a playful smile Leaflet from leaflet lightly loosening, shook The petals o'er a wretch who all the while Writhed under each in agony. That small Tormentor seem'd to sniff with keen delight Some gust of suffering made more exquisite By every fragrant rose-leaf he let fall. 8 “'Twas thou then?”—“Mighty Master, it was I.” “What new atrocity of torturing Hast thou invented, Imp of Hell? That sigh Which made me shudder, even me thy king, How hast thou wrung it from a human heart? What was thy weapon? scorpions seethed in flame? Or fangs of adders? Name me, Imp, its name, And show me how 'tis shaped, thy devilish dart.” 9 The little plump-cheek'd cherub of the pit (A kid among the goats, with budding horn) Falter'd—“Dread Lord, I know no name for it. Soft are my roses, and without a thorn.” “Why thus, then, dost thou strew them?”—“Pardon me,” The Hell-whelp whined, “this man hath suffer'd so!” “Ha, fool! and thou dost pity him? Go, go, And learn mankind. Thou art a child, I see.” 10 Blushing resentful, “Prince,” the Imp replied, “What dost thou take me for? 'Tis true my brothers Are bigger, but” (and this he lisp'd with pride) “I scorn their clumsy practice. How those others Get out of breath in running down their prey, Fatigue themselves in torturing mankind! My work, if easier, is more refined, Look at this wretch's wounds. How fresh are they! 11 “From men he got them, Master, not from me. Yet each hath been a master-stroke I swear. Which, but that one by one he got them, he Had surely not had strength enough to bear. Man's work, yet perfect! Hate without remorse: Deep thought: deliberate purpose: patient skill: Oh, naught was wanting to each human will That stabb'd here! How could this man's wounds be worse? 12 “I merely keep them open. Toucht again, Tho' ne'er so lightly, each one burns and gapes. A rose-leaf does it. By disguised disdain That friendship's frank commiseration apes, Men taught me this. The trick is simple, see! Yet 'neath such touches strongest spirits wince.” “Away! away!” cried Hell's impatient Prince; “Release yon sufferer, leave his soul to me.” 13 The chidden Imp, reluctant, left his prey, Like a chased fly. Man's arch accuser stood Contèmplating man's victim. Silent lay The wretch, unconscious of worse neighbourhood Than he had felt before. In that soul's curse The gaze of Satan, piercing, could detect How heart and brain met shatter'd to reflect In a flaw'd mirror a warp'd universe. 14 “And thou hast suffer'd greatly?” musing said The Prince of Pain. The sufferer slowly raised The heavy burthen of a hopeless head, And, 'neath a half-uplifted eyelid, gazed Upon the Rebel Angel's ruin'd brow, And recognised Hell's Anarch, and replied Indifferently, with neither shame nor pride, Unto the voice of Satan, “Even as thou.” 15 “Then 'twas too much,” mutter'd the Fiend. “I own No peer in torment; and I scorn to share With human brows my solitary crown. Soul,—whom man's hate hath forced mine own to spare, Lest at the last extremity his prey Should prove in aught my rival,—rest!” And slow, With wistful gesture, from that human woe Satan, half-sighing, turn'd, and fled away. XXXV. QUESTIONABLE CONSOLATION. 1 A butterfly (and had the wretch been born With all the beauties that, at best, adorn A butterfly's complete perfection, still He but a butterfly had been, at best) Came into life a cripple; dispossest Of half his natural features; born i' the chill, Blemisht, and misbegotten; an abortion Doom'd from the birth to suffering and distortion. 2 One wing unfinisht, and misshapen one: Six legs he had, but of his six legs none That served the purpose for which legs are made: The piteous pivot of his own distress, Aye with self-torturing unsteadiness About himself he turn'd; and found no aid In aught that life vouchsafed him, leg or wing, To life's attainment of one wisht-for thing. 3 He saw the others hovering in the sun; He saw them seek each other; saw them shun Each other, by each other to be sought; He saw them (each, itself, a second flower) On flowers, entranced by the transcendent power Of their own happiness; he saw them, fraught With frolic rapture, fearless wantons all! And saw himself, unable even to crawl. 4 “And I,” he thought, “I too, was meant to be A wingèd joy, a wandering ecstasy! Ah, must I envy, for his happier lot, The wingless worm that hath, complete, whate'er As worm he wants; who wants no more, to fare Thro' life content; by life defrauded not Of what mere life makes capable of joy Even in a worm? still happier far than I! 5 “I, to whom life refuses all things! all Life's joy in earth, air, water! Still too tall The tiniest stem that bears the lowliest flower For me to climb! too rough air's lightest sigh For me to ride! the nearest dewdrop, dry Ere I can reach it! All, beyond my power! All, save to disappear—go down—go by— Sink out of life, not having lived—and die!” 6 The dying sun the insect's dying moan O'erheard, and answer'd from his falling throne, “Mourn not! I even, I, the sun, go down, Sink, and drop into darkness. Look at me!” —He sinks. In pompous purple, pillows he, His kingly forehead, girt with golden crown, And, slowly, with delight his gaze grows dim, Seeing earth's sadness for the loss of him. 7 Delicious homage of a dear dismay Paid to the happy, when they pass away, By grief not theirs! Beneath him, prostrate, lies A world that worships him; and everywhere Therein he finds some record rich and fair Of his own power. He sinks: and wistful eyes His pathway follow to its glorious bourn. He sinks: and longing voices sigh “Return!” 8 He passes: but he hath not pass'd in vain. He passes, proving by life's loss its gain, And bearing with him what he leaves behind. He goes: rejoicing, “All that I have given Memory makes mine again, and makes it even Mine more completely than before. I shined Rising and setting. All my light was shown, And all my force was felt.” Thus suns go down. 9 The boastful orb's last glories, lingering, That cripple smote. “Go, glories! tell your king,” Smiling he said, “go, him that sent you tell, Not all so wretched as I deem'd was I. Since I have seen how suns go down, thereby School'd have I been to know, and value well, What they, the happy,—they that have it not,— Would fain filch even from a wretch's lot, 10 “The grandeur of its utter desolation.” All glowing with rebuke and shamed vexation The braggart sun's resentful blushes burst, As o'er the deep, whose surface, and no more, His glory gilt, he, slowly sinking, bore This knowledge gain'd: that Misery at her worst Hath one poor grace of tragic interest Proud Pleasure vainly envies at his best. XXXVI. FORGIVE AND FORGET. 1 “Forgive! forget! In haste I spoke. My speech was rash. Resent it not. Their words unwill'd my lips revoke. Stretch out thy hand. Be all forgot.” But stunn'd, and still'd, the listener stood. From stricken heart to sullen brain Rebounding beat the insurgent blood, Then clogg'd the gates of life again. 2 Those rosy roads where tranquil Thought And Feeling once, like merchant peers, Embracing mix'd the treasures brought From their harmonious hemispheres; In these, Resentment, outraged Pride, Wrong'd Honour, Wrath, and rebel Doubt Now strove, with forces wandering wide, From Reason's stately ranks thrown out. 3 “‘Forgive? Forget?’ 'Tis lightly said,” The sullen answer came at last Half-crusht, as thro' the spikes it sped Of Pride's portcullis—teeth shut fast. “‘Forgive! forget!’ And in my place, Say what wouldst thou, the wronger, do?” “I swear it, as I hope for grace, I would forgive, forgetting too! 4 “And oh that in thy place I were, The wronger thou, and mine the wrong! Nay, hold me to the oath I swear, And try me if it hold not strong.” “Man, words are hasty: even so Thyself hast said.”—“Not hasty this! O trust it! try it! ask or do Whate'er thou wilt.”—“Thou will'st it?”—“Yes.” 5 A blow . . . and he that spake the last Beneath the bank where they two stood Was rolling wrapt in foam, and fast Borne onward by the boisterous flood. He beats the blinding wave with strength: Chill'd, shaking, aching, drench'd, to shore He struggles: climbs the bank at length: And feebly feels alive once more. 6 “Forgive! forget! I struck in haste. My blow was rash. Resent it not. Is wrong forgiven not wrong effaced? Stretch out thy hand. Be all forgot.” In wrathful mood he turn'd about, Remember'd—realised—forgave— And, with a rueful smile, held out His right hand dripping from the wave. 7 “Nay, overhasty still! First dry Yon chilly drench that drips amain, For who would care to embrace (not I!) A slobber'd gutter retching rain?” “Unjust!” he cried. “Take witness, heaven, Struck, sicken'd, soak'd to a sop by thee, The shock, the shame, I have forgiven, Nor mine the fault if chill'd I be. 8 “My garments drip, my blood runs cold, My limbs are loosed, my lips are blue, And if I live till I grow old, 'Twill be, methinks, no thanks to you. I heed not how my hurts were got, I only know they hurt me yet; But all, it seems, suffices not, Half-drown'd, you'd have me still not wet!” 9 “'Tis well! Thou understand'st me now. I, too, can strive: I, too, can brave What Friendship feels from Friendship's blow: Can pluck my soul from out the wave Of overwhelming wrath and shame, Reach shore, and, shivering there (like thee) Embrace my friend. But not the same As Friendship was can Friendship be. 10 “For lost to love, tho' love may last, Is all that love must needs forgive; And, tho' forgot, the painful past Its prey forgets not. Maim'd we live. In memory's haunts a horror grows, That marks one unremember'd spot; And still the hoary hemlock blows Where blows the blue forget-me-not.” XXXVII. THE MOUNTAINS OF TIME. The rest that man runs after lures the wretch From every place where he at rest may be; So that his legs are ever on the stretch, And not one moment of repose hath he. This frenzy is in certain folks so strong That, when they find the pavement of the city Where they walk up and down the whole day long Not rough enough, however hard and gritty, It is their wont, some once or twice a year, To slip away, as wild as hawk or merlin, From all that city folks hold justly dear In London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, Berlin, And seek out mountain places nature made On purpose for uncomfortable walking. To swell the number of these fools, I paid A visit to the Alps; which, after stalking Thro' stony vales, I reach'd, and sought repose Fatiguingly a whole flea-bitten night, Outfidgeted in a chill Châlet, close By a green Glacier. There, before the light I from bed's antisoporific rose, And set forth booted on my bootless road; Wondering which first would wear the other out, The mountain or the boots that o'er it strode. But both the granite strong and leather stout Remain'd intact: and tho' to own it loth, 'Tis I that was worn out between them both. And, when I reach'd the summit where I thought To pluck pure rapture, life's high alpine flower, Faint in the snow I stumbled, and besought My guide to let me sleep away the hour 'Twas settled we must pass there. He replied “As Monsieur pleases: but make haste he must.” “I'll sleep, then, in a hurry, friend,” I sigh'd. The good man nodded: fish'd a cheese and crust Out of his wallet; sat down at my side; And munch'd his breakfast while his watch he kept. Dim round about me wink'd the prospect wide, Down sank my heavy eyelids, and I slept. Or slept not? That's the question. Sleep or waking, No change of scene across my vision came. The mountains, which I had erewhile been taking Such stupid pains to mount, with frozen frame Still clasp'd the picture which, of Fancy's making Or Nature's own, was round me, still the same. The only change (for which I can't account) Was that my sense of lassitude was gone, And force was mine to pass from mount to mount, For miles and miles, still upward and still on. But what is certainly just now surprising Is that I felt not then the least surprise Either at this continual uprising And journeying onward, just as the bird flies, Or at the strange means of mine own devising I found within me (how, I can't surmise) Of getting, to my mute interrogation, From all those mountains, marvellous replies. Much this discovery pleased me as a new one. And to a modest mamelary peak Which, tho' an Alp (a genuine and a true one) Yet, being milder-minded, so to speak, Of aspect than the rest (who seem'd to view one With countenances anything but meek) Inspired me with less awe than all his brothers, I said as much. “Ay,” musingly quoth he, “The others speak not.”—“Friend,” said I, “what others?” “The other mountains,” short he answer'd me. “What other mountains?” With a touch of mirth Sublime, he laugh'd “The mountains of the earth.” “Pray, may I ask, then, of what kind they be, The mountains I've the honour of addressing?” “Certainly. Mountains, not of Space, are we,” He answer'd, “but of Time.”—“Of Time?” confessing Imprudently mine ignorance, said I, “This is the first time I have ever heard That Timehas mountains. Pray what are they made of?” As tho' he thought this question most absurd, Mine Alp survey'd me sternly, icily; Then with a slight shrug I felt sore afraid of Half loosed an avalanche, and grumbled “Pooh, man! Are they not peers and kinsmen, Time and Space? And pray to Time, the peer of Space, do you, man, Deny his rights, his mountains?”—“Heaven forbid, no!” I hasten'd to reply. “But, save Your Highness, I know not (heartily I wish I did know!) Nor can I” (here I stammer'd, seized with shyness) “Imagine what they're made of. As for Space, Why, all the earth affords to Space material For mountain-making. But that's not the case With Time, which is” ... “What's Time?” mockmagisterial Of mien, he interposed in accents quizzical, “What's Time?” Now, tho' 'tis true I might have quoted A dozen learnèd authors metaphysical Who have ... well, well, not wasted, but devoted A deal of time to the consideration Of what Time is,—yet (as with shame I noted) Ere I had time to bring out one quotation, Contemptuously looking down on me, My questioner relieved the hesitation His question caused me; for “Whate'er Time be,” He added, answering his own query, “Time, Whose child am I .... Tho', if I say I am, Since naked truth's too freezingly sublime I use, for your sake, a mere verbal sham: For, truth to say, I'm nothing of the kind, And Time is nothing, and there's nothing true. But that's beyond the limits of your mind, And naturally bounded point of view. Oh, no offence, man! Certes you'd not find Such terms offensive, if you only knew The advantage of those bounds; wherein confined, Man's reason moves with accuracy thro' The crowded thoroughfares of sense, that wind In all directions up and down his brain. These bounds are paved off pathways which allow The poor foot-passenger, who else were slain, Keeping along the narrow tracks they show, To walk securely, and escape the train Of steeds and chariots that, fast speeding, flow And flash all round him, in a roaring tide Certain to crush him if he once broke thro' His pavement barriers upon either side. So, to the point. We here, who people Time, As bodies people Space,—the Hours are we. The Past upheaves us. Some of us, sublime, And others lowly, as no doubt you see. That's as Time makes us, of what men make him. I'm but the Hour of a small office clerk, Whose whole life was so quiet, dim, and prim, There's nothing in me to invite remark. The man who made what Time hath made of me Lived seventy years; full fifty years of which He served the State. When just about to be Promoted to a post that was the pitch Of his life's aim (tho' naught to boast of) he, Poor devil, died an hour too soon. And thus The mouse with which I am parturient Remains within me, evermore, a mus Nondum obortus. His own fault, I grant. But since your time is short, make much of us. Seize the occasion. Ask whate'er you want. Many a point remains yet to discuss. Question the higher Hours.” I took the hint; And, having scarcely time to question Time, Address'd a mount whose purple brows did print The azure air with pines, that strove to climb From cloud to cloud into the golden tint That wrapp'd his summit from the rosy prime. And “I,” said he, “am, in a lover's life The longest Hour. For ten impatient years He, with relentless fortune, lived at strife. At length love triumph'd over foes and fears. And in a wood, where she had sworn to meet him, The coming of his mistress did he wait, While every rustling leaf conspired to cheat him, Mocking her steps. She came—an hour too late. And, in that hour, such doubts and such despairs Convulsed his amorous imagination That I became volcanic unawares, And choking with internal conflagration, As you perceive.” But I, the truth to say, Perceived not even the slightest indication Of fires internal in that mountain grey. Tho', after somewhat closer contemplation, I spied, 'tis true, a bare patch on his pate, Which some long empty crater might have been; But I believe 'twas only baldness. Straight I turn'd me towards a giant glacier, green With hideous glooms. “What art thou?” I exclaim'd. “I,” sigh'd the icy Horror, and his breath Froze the blood in me when his name he named, “Am the Last Hour of one condemn'd to death For having murder'd life. Look at me close. Throughout the Hour I am, one after one, All the lost moments of that man's life rose Up to the surface of his soul. Deeds done, Days undone, wild desires, and wicked wishes, Pure joys defiled, and faded memories fond. One after one they rose up like dead fishes To the sick surface of a poison'd pond. He, in this Hour a hundred times eternal, A child once more, the games of childhood play'd; Felt on his brow the kiss of lips maternal; A father's counsels heard and disobey'd; Far, far away, by flowery paths infernal, From innocence, repose, and virtue stray'd; Felt in his breast love's primal passion burning, The pang of jealousy's envenom'd dart, The shock of faith betray'd, the bitter turning Of love to hate, the ravage of the heart, Despair, debauchery, destruction, crime, Conscience, and memory—the soul's last cry! Behold me. All the emptiness of Time, And all the wretchedness of Life, am I!” Smitten with fear, I fled. Nor dared I deem My soul in safety till I 'scaped the sight Of that atrocious solitude. My dream Meanwhile pursued me till I reach'd a height Surpassing all the others. 'Twas so high That I perceived below me, far below, The tallest Alps no bigger to mine eye Than grains of salt. Naught breathed between the brow Of this stupendous berg and the bare sky. Oh never yet with such a load of snow Was earth encumber'd! “Here, at last,” said I, “Must be the Chimborazo, nothing less, Of human thought. For surely, surely, he Who raised to such a height the heaviness Of this all-else-surpassing pile must be Earth's master-mind. Time meets eternity, Stretch'd to this altitude.” Then loud I cried “O Atlas, Atlas! tell me, who created Thy giant form?” Long while no voice replied, And in the silence of the waste I waited Wondering, what bard had built this mighty epos: At length, a plaintive, sleepy whisper sigh'd “I am the weariest Hour yet known to fate, Pass'd by a schoolboy, in midsummer tide, Condemn'd, for misdemeanours, to translate A dozen chapters of Cornelius Nepos.” Soon as that voice I heard, I seem'd to see And feel myself transform'd—evaporated, Then again frozen—and, at last, to be That mountain in wide azure isolated. Or, rather, seem'd that mountain part of me. For I remember'd that my life had dated Just such an hour. My soul became one yawn. My lassitude return'd. Again I stumbled And sank down, just where I had sunk at dawn, As faintly “Alcibiades,” I mumbled, “Cliniæ filius, Atheniensis”... “Come, wake, sir! Time's up, and we've miles to make yet.” My guide's voice thus recall'd me to my senses. I rose, and rubb'd mine eyes; and, scarce awake yet, Look'd round—and recognised them every one: The amorous and agèd Don-Juanic Volcano, with his bald head in the sun, Proud of his long-quench'd spritely spurts volcanic; The mamelon in labour with its mouse; The convict's frozen conscience; that titanic Alp-upon-alp of taskwork tyrannous; At whose sight, I sprang forward with a thrill Of anguish, trying vainly to complete My chapter of Cornelius Nepos still. The guide, in front, cried “Eh sir, mind your feet! Nor look down yonder till we've turn'd the hill. The tug's to come yet.” In his winding-sheet The convict glared upon me, grim and chill. “How call you yonder glacier, my good man, eh?” “Sir,” said the guide, “we call it Le Condamné. Mind where you step now.”—“Yes,” I murmur'd, “yes, Atheniensis Alcibiades”... XXXVIII. CONSERVATION OF FORCE. 1. A musician once, in the twilight time, Musing sat by the instrument Whose keys knew how, with a kindred chime, To interpret to him what his musings meant. Then a picture, the man had seen that day And, because of its colour or composition, Had, deep in the soul of him, borne away, Unmiss'd, from its place in the Exhibition, Began to suffer a mystic change, And pass from the soul where its own lay pent On the wings of a melody wild and strange; Which, as 'twere in a dream, his fingers went Wandering after, over the keys; Whose notes were thus scatter'd, and then again blent Till the twilight was fill'd with the music of these. 2. But when, like a wind from a land unknown, That comes and goes with a will of its own, The strain died out, and left, as it died, The throbbing silence unsatisfied, A friend of the player's who, listening, sat In that twilight chamber beside him, cried With a sigh, “Continue!” “Continue what? I have not been playing,” the player replied, “But only thinking—ah, thinking? nay, But rather dreaming all thought away About a picture I saw to-day.” “Strange!” said the other; “and whilst unto thee I was listening, just ere thy music fainted, A poem impress'd itself on me, As clear as a picture freshly painted. Farewell, ere I lose it!” Then home went he, And wrote the poem to which that strain Had changed itself in the poet's brain. 3. This poem another painter read; And it haunted that other painter's head, Till of it another picture he made; Which, like the first, was exhibited. 4. When, after many a year was past, Those pictures twain were uphung at last Side by side on the self-same wall Of the same museum, they did not fall Into the arms of each other, the one Crying “My father!” the other “My son!” Tho' in line direct was their filiation. But, like two athletes, they struggled and fought Against each other without cessation. And men, taking part in the contest, brought Daily, to deepen it, fresh contestation. Critic and craftsman, with praise or blame, Choosing their side in the battle, became, These the passionate partisans Of the style of the earlier master; those Of the style of the later; until two clans Of disciples, two schools of art, arose, Which, in turn, put forth for the world's applause Masterpieces of different kinds; The unlike effects of a single cause, One force transmitted thro' many minds. 5. For, tho' none of the critics of this was aware, And not even the craftsmen the secret knew, Yet all these pictures the offspring were Of a single picture—the first of the two. XXXIX. HOMERIDES. 1. Nature hath given the Stag a wondrous gift. Love, and the force that loving hearts doth lift To lofty courage by the sweet desire Of winning love, have with creative fire Gone to his burning brain, and thence burst out In that brave crest he proudly bears about. Thus, in love's complete beauty arm'd, he roams The gusty realms of passion, and becomes A living tempest; with whate'er in storm Hath being—motion swift, majestic form, Strife, rapture, peril, and the pomp of power. Then, like the storm which hath its one wild hour And passes, he—his passion once subdued By surfeit fierce—returns to solitude. 2. A Beetle, burrowing where a Stag had been, Humm'd “Ha, brave buck! here hast thou left, I ween, To me who live upon thy leavings, fine And fit material for a crown like thine! For I surmise, since matter's everywhere, That everything is matter. Maidens, fair And pure, I've seen, who stoop'd to pluck and place (Charm'd by the beauty of it and the grace) In that sweet haunt of the Hesperides, The guardian of whose hidden apples is Jealous Desire, some flow'ret haply fed On the foul scrapings of the cattle-shed: And, if such filth could into beauty bud, Beauty, thou art but metamorphosed mud! Eureka! Here must the Stag's secret lie. Could I but catch it, doubtless also I Should get the grace to which my soul aspires, And sprout those horns the horn-mad world admires.” 3. With which intent, on what he found he fed; Till gradually from his insect head The superfluity of matter there Oozed out in frontal ornaments that were Not all unlike the antlers of a stag. Then, quite contented, he began to brag, “A stag am I, and brave mine antlers be!” 4. And yet he was but a stag-beetle, he. MORAL. The poet's form is to his followers known. The poet's secret is the poet's own. 'Tis born and buried in the poet's soul: Passion its prelude, solitude its goal. XL. POINTS DE VUE—POINT DE VUE. 1 A dweller in a city of the plain, Bound on a journey to a mountain land, First pray'd a famous traveller to explain How best he might behold, and understand, The rumour'd wonders of that lofty region, For by report the name of them was legion. 2 “There's but one way,” the traveller replied, “Beneath the highest mountain of them all There lies a little town. Get there a guide: Then, rest not till you reach its summit tall. The ascent is difficult. I grant 'tis double— But it is also twice well worth—the trouble. 3 “For by this means not only will you be Rewarded with an admirable view, But 'tis, indeed, the only means to see At one wide eyesweep, adequately true And comprehensive in its contemplation, The whole of that high land's configuration.” 4 Struck by the justice of his friend's advice, Which promised an incomparable sight, And full of ardour, on his enterprise The man set forth. He reach'd the inn at night Commended by the traveller; went to bed, Slept well, waked early, rose, dress'd, breakfasted; 5 And from the casement of his room could see That mighty mountain clad in cloud and snow. The guide inform'd him that, to mount it, three Good days 'twould take him; to descend it, two. But he before him had a fortnight's time, Nor need begin in haste that task sublime. 6 So he resolved to make a first essay By visiting the hills and slopes that lower, Lapping the flanks of that high mountain, lay Like housetops huddled round a minster tower; This promenade was picturesque, and soon Completed in one pleasant afternoon. 7 'Tis true the prospects it unfolded each One corner only of the picture show'd: But all the others he proposed to reach, One after one, by the same easy road, Encouragingly smooth for a beginner, The following days 'twixt breakfast-time and dinner. 8 “For thus shall I have witness'd all,” he said, “In course of time; and witness'd all without Foregoing for that purpose board or bed, And being thoroughly fatigued no doubt.” So said, so done; and home again content, Having climb'd all those little hills, he went. 9 Their various points of view had pleased him well; Their slopes were wooded, and their tops were green: From each he saw across the neighbouring dell: But saw no further: for each crest had been In turn commanded by some other crest, Just high enough to overtop the rest. 10 In silence did his travell'd friend receive The tale of those short journeys; and replied “The charm of your excursion, I perceive, Lay in those little slopes that, every side, Shut out the distance; hills climb'd yesterday Bounding to-morrow's prospect all the way. 11 “With not more trouble, and in shorter time, You, following my counsel, would have seen The whole horizon's airy orb sublime Reveal'd beyond each decorated screen Of those low mountains. For that summit tall Of which I told you doth surmount them all. 12 “I, in man's thought, as 'twere a bird behold, Born to disport itself in space, with wing Unfetter'd by the wires, tho' they be gold, Of any cage. Albeit I grant birds sing In cages. But that, doubtless, is a merit They from the freeborn songsters do inherit. 13 “And better, to my thinking, one high note Dropt by the soaring skylark from the sky Than all that's warbled from a cageling's throat. Minds are there, too, whose natural home is high; One word they drop in passing is worth more Than tutor'd twitterers twitter by the score.” XLI. PYRRHONISM, OR, THE HAUNTED HEN. 1. A hen, whom the bounty of Providence made A parent prolific, with motherly pride Every day a fresh egg in the henroost laid, Which to hatch into life she then patiently tried. But, whilst on those eggs she was brooding warm In a placid glow of parental pleasure, Chill was the change as she spied with alarm A Weasel, who watch'd her, aware of her treasure. And this Hen henceforth was so haunted by The chilly charm of that Weasel's eye, That, night by night, in her dreaming sleep It was ever the self-same dream she dream'd; How, changed to a Weasel, she crept in the deep Of the dark to the henroost; and, stealthily seem'd With the craft of a Weasel to suck and destroy Those eggs that, by day, were the poor fowl's joy. 2. This double identity, made up of two— Her waking and sleeping self—at last The Hen's life into confusion threw, And over it, daily and nightly, cast The spell of a twofold trouble. By day She lived in such dread of her midnight dream That at length not an egg was she able to lay: Yet this daily sterility did not redeem From its nightly plague her spirit tormented, When she, by the dream's transforming power, Changed into a Weasel, was discontented At finding no more any eggs to devour. 3. “Ah, had I,” she sigh'd, “but the gift to forget, I might hope to recapture lost happiness yet! Then, by day, with a spirit unvext should I Taste the soothing sweets of maternity, Whilst the ravisher's raptures of cruel delight Would be mine, with young victims to ruin, by night. But alas! as it is, I can neither enjoy The rude libertine's lust, nor the love of the mother; Who, combining two selves that each other destroy, Fail to realise either the one or the other!” MORAL. So are we: who, both author and critic in one, Miss the comfort accorded to either alone. By alternate creative and critical powers Is our suffering identity sunder'd and torn: And the tooth of the critic that's in us devours Half the author's conceptions before they are born. XLII. THE MOUNTAIN AND THE MARSH. A REVERIE. 1. Low natures cannot even forgive the good Another's greatness on their fate entails. 'Twixt sea and land a granite Mountain stood, No further than a wounded bittern trails His broken wing, beyond a Swampy Flood Foul with green ooze. The inland-blowing gales That died upon his summit did bequeath A quiet climate to the land beneath. 2. The gracious image of this Mountain slept Unruffled in the dark of that dull Meer; Where rarely even a lazy ripple crept To bid the bulrush shake his languid spear O'er livid streaks of stagnant scum, that kept The calm contour, with every outline clear, And all the colours of the portraiture, Tho' painted on a filthy surface, pure. 3. But daily ever, when the sun was low, And, in a rosy reflex aureole, The guardian Mount's grey head began to glow, From out his marble-breasted body stole, And sidled, lingering to the lowland slow, What seem'd the Mountain's disembodied soul: A stealthy, shy, and solitary elf, The insubstantial semblance of himself. 4. Over the fens it fared, where dreamy rows Of cattle farmward moved their wandering camp; But scarce had reach'd the rivage, ere there rose Resentful challenge from that churlish Swamp; Hoarse as the choral croak that overflows In gleaming eves of Spring the shallows damp, And reedy brinks, of their spawn-mantled bogs, From many thousand throats of querulous frogs: “Halt, vagabond! halt where thou art! Nor insult with thy presence abhorr'd The floor of my palace. Depart, Silly slave of an insolent lord! “And thou, broad braggart, I pray Invade not my virginal bed. Let the earth to thy foot give way, And the heaven to thy horrible head: “Parade thine imperial mantle, Which this lackey behind thee doth bear, Till it leaves not uncover'd a cantle Of the subject world—elsewhere: “But sully not with it my fountain! Queen am I in my realm: and thine, Tho' it prison the sun, proud mountain, I allow not alliance with mine.” 5. The gracious Mount, aware of his wrong'd worth, Made generous answer in grave tones and sweet; Around him gazing, east, west, south, and north, With kingly calm that claim'd attention meet; While that sick shrew spat her foul spittle forth And in her own filth wallow'd at his feet. His voice was as the sighing of a breeze Born on the bosom of the boundless seas: “Friend, leave to the human race The inhuman habit of war! To each in the world his place, And we are whatever we are. To each his good and his ill: And the ill of the good made mine Is that, doom'd to forever be still, I must ever for motion pine. The bees and the butterflies Hover over the blossom bells; And the birds in the balmy skies, And the feathery-sail'd seed-cells, They wander about; and I, As I watch them, wish that I were A bee, or a butterfly, Or a little bird of the air! But to each in the world his place, And to every ill some good. Unto me my granite base, And to thee thy shelter'd flood. Yet O, how the spirit in me Is troubled when bound, alas, To this granite base, I see (As the pure winds over me pass) The leaflet leap on the tree, And the flow'ret nod in the grass, And the long grass wave on the lea, And the reed in the wan morass! And thou, too? Dost thou not feel (When the sedge to the low wind sighs) Sweet tremors over thee steal, And a rapture of ripples arise? Say, wouldst thou not follow the wind In a wave of wonder away, Were thy waters unconfined By their osier cradle grey? The hungry ocean, hidden By me from the heedless land; Which it leaps to devour, and, chidden, Falls back at my mute command: Fares it better than thou who, rockt By low-breathing winds, and fann'd To sleep, liest safely lockt In the hollow of earth's huge hand? No! it suffers the same effect, Only all on a vaster scale. And if thy small fleets unwreckt Are but blown by a baby gale, (Dead leaflets gaily speckt, With a spider's web for a sail) Whilst yonder (a floating fort) The battle-ship huge, that mocks The enemy's bellowing port, Sinks shatter'd on surfy rocks. Who shelters thee, thankless Queen, Secure in thy small domain? I, the friend of whose shade serene Thy churlish lips complain! I, the giant who stand between Thy rest and the roaring main!” 6. The brave old Mount, by wounding weathers scarr'd, O'er the low-sunken, safely-shelter'd lea, Which his grey head from howling gusts did guard, And o'er the rolling ridges of the sea, Sent far his grave, calm, satisfied regard; Then glanced athwart that gloomy Swamp, but she Sigh'd only, sullen, from her sedgy beach, As, smiling, he resumed, in mountain-speech: “O rapturous, wandering wings, O rivulets, running for ever, O winds, clouds, waves, happy things! I, that never may follow you, never Taste with you a traveller's bliss, As ye roam over moorland and meadow, I, at least (and who grudges me this?) Send forth on his travels my Shadow. 'Tis a gentle and timorous sprite, That never, except when night Is falling, ventures far; And, albeit inquisitive, most Discreet; not given to boast, As other travellers are; Pure, tho' it sleep in the slime; Shy as a young bird thrown Unfledged from its nest sublime; Yet with secret joys of its own; And by only two at a time Is its intimate sweetness known. But of any two lovers, I pray, Be it ask'd if they love not the shade: And the happy ones, boy and maid, Will blush as they turn away Sighing and smiling, afraid Its secret bliss to betray; Whilst the others, whose hearts be cleft For the grave of a lost love, laid Dead in its birthplace,—'reft Of the hopes that with shadows have play'd, Will sigh ‘Our sole happiness left Is to wander and weep in the shade.’ Why is it? They know not why. 'Tis an antique mystery. This nursling of Night's lone heart Hath known sorrow, and learn'd to be still But it cherisheth, pure and apart, In its own chaste silence chill, A memory, mighty, immense Of passionate love and pain; A memory mixt with a sense Of deep desire and disdain; A memory made intense By a love that was loved in vain!” 7. Here, soughing in the sedge, the Water made A restless moan of weary resignation; As who should say ‘I heed not what is said, Altho' I hear it.’ And a dull pulsation Darken'd the melancholy moonbeam laid To listless rest along the late stagnation Of the now rippled liquid in her lone Low reedy creeks. The musing Mount went on: “Ere Love was acquainted with Sorrow, Ere Eve was a wife or a mother, Ere the even was 'ware of the morrow, Or yet either had banisht the other, In Eden the Night and the Morn Were dissever'd as soon as born. The Fiat Lux thunders thro' heaven! And, awakening Creation, hath riven The resonant portals of Light. All gushing with glorious surprises The Sun, in his royalty, rises, And bursts on the realm of the Night. He comes! and the Silence profound, That hath watch'd with droopt wings spread afar Over Night's maiden dreams, at the sound Of the steps of the conquering star, Is smitten and scatter'd in flight. And he comes: lifts the veil from her breast, And sees naked the beautiful Night. Venit, vidit . . . . who knows not the rest? O what an awakening was there! What rapture! and O what despair! One moment hath ruin'd forever Love and power. Alas, he, and she? Light and Darkness? Impossible! Never, O never, such union can be! Such, of old, was the destiny vain Of that incompatible twain: And such is the endless condition Of Passion, the child of disdain And desire,—life and death in transition! Hope snatcht from the breast of despair Is hers, and a life that is death; For she breathes in the deadliest air, And she dies of but one quiet breath. Her food is the fruit that's forbidden: Her pleasure a prayer never granted: Her strength is a wish that is chidden: And her weakness the thing that she wanted!” 8. High winds, that vex'd not the still earth, began To smite the upmost heaven. With fitful light The stricken moon thro' fleecy cloudlets ran. The Mountain, from that drift of dark and bright Which o'er him glimpsed in alternation wan, Caught mystic motion; and, in spectral flight Hovering above the melancholy plain, The spirit that was in him spake again: “And the Sun, never-resting, forsaken, And fierce in his anguish of light, Cries thro' heaven ‘Where art thou? awaken, And return to me, fugitive Night!’ But she, whose unsatisfied lover Thus renews his importunate flame, Where hides she? with what does she cover Her beauty, her babe, and her shame? Ask yon quivering splendours, that swim The blue dark in bright shoals overspread, If they know in what solitude dim Night is hiding her desolate head: And those liveried lackeys of Light (In the cause of Light's glory enlisted) Will answer ‘What is it, the Night? 'Tis a myth that has never existed!’ Ask the planet whose golden urn Flows over with flaming amber As he, courtier-like, taketh his turn In the sun's bright antechamber: He laugheth ‘The Sun is my king: The fallen are soon forgot: I follow the conquering: And the Night? . . . I know her not.’ And the sliding meteor will say, As he falls in a fiery drop, ‘Who cares? I have miss'd my way, And can neither retrace it nor stop.’ And, blushing, the Dawn will sigh ‘I awaked ere my dreams were done. They were fair; but I know not, I, If I dream'd of the Night . . . or the Sun?’ And, if all things else deny her, Renounce the Night or ignore, Go, ask of the ghostly fire That hovers on that pale shore, Where, embark'd in its phantom comet, The wandering embryon waits God's finger to fashion from it A world of yet unknown fates: It will mutter ‘I mark'd her creeping, By the light of a latent moon, Between two worlds and weeping, Like a beggar that asks a boon At the gates of a rich man's place, With a shamed and sorrowful mien: And I think it was to embrace Her sleeping babe unseen.’ “That babe, is it Bliss? But aloud Breathe the name of it never! At best 'Tis a treasure that, risk'd if avow'd, Is in fear and in peril possest: Whose possessor, as one that encroacheth Upon ground that's forbidden, by night, All atremble his treasure approacheth But to bury it deep out of sight. And, O thou to whom never before Hath been utter'd this antique story, Insult not the shade (tho' no more Than a shadow it be) of lost glory. For what it must be at the last The Present doth ill to scorn. And the Present shall be the Past Ere the Future it boasts be born.” 9. Never before that venerable Mount Had spoken at such length: nor ever met A listener in whose ear he could recount Without ungracious interruption, yet, The fancies vague that, like a vented fount Whose struggling waters sudden outlet get, Upwell'd within him, and pour'd wide and free His secret thoughts in wandering reverie. 10. But ah! the old story-teller's pride received A sharp rebuff—not loud, but, certes, deep! When, pausing for an answer, he perceived The Water had been all this while asleep. Sleep thou, too, good old Mount! with heart ungrieved, Tho' heedless ears thy long discourse hold cheap. Sleep, and good dreams be thine! There are sins worse Than too much talk in unregarded verse. 11. And, if men miss the moral of thy strain, Tell them 'tis in themselves, and tell them why. Wherever croaking commonwealths complain Of their old mountain bulwarks and deny Even the shadow of greatness, where in vain Is heard the voice of hoar Authority, There, lost among the morals of the time, May haply lurk the moral of thy rhyme. XLIII. TELEOLOGY. 1. The casement of a chamber in an inn O'erlook'd a courtyard full of weeds and stones. And on the stones and weeds that deck'd therein A haunt of blue-flies, heap'd with offal, bones, Ordures, and broken pots and rusty tin, (Which 'neath this casement made a goodly show) Out of the lattice from the room within, A traveller whom it lodged was wont to throw The soap-suds daily scraped from cheek and chin, His razor's refuse, mixt with frothy flow Of basin-rinsings warm; nor cared a pin Whose pate might catch such casual chrism. Below Upon a dunghill, thirsty, parcht, and thin, A miserable nettle chanced to grow. 2. This wretched weed, which else had died of drought, In the chance rescue of that daily rain Its own advantage found; and, free from doubt, Perceiving in it adaptation plain Of means to a beneficent design, Exclaim'd “O Urticarian Jupiter, What wisdom is there in thy will divine! Who dost on all thy universe confer Convincing proofs of providence benign. By what supreme administrative feat Hast thou contrived for me, thy grateful child, Recurrence of this tepid torrent sweet! Which every morning with its moisture mild Revives my strength, and heals all hurtful heat. Whilst, regularly rising day by day, Thy gracious sun rules all the rolling year, Warms the wide world with his benignant ray, And in their season bids my buds appear. How admirably organised is all This wondrous world! whose aspect everywhere Reveals to reverent thought, in great and small, Contrivance order'd with consummate care Its maker's purpose to fulfil: which is The happiness of nettles. Mighty Jove, On me thy mercies have not fallen amiss. Thy purpose I divine: and, proud to prove My part therein, each seed of mine that settles Shall do its best to fill the world with nettles.” 3. Thus, in good faith, the thriving weed adored The patronage of providence; and, wedding, The graceful action to the grateful word, Began to cover with a verdant spreading Of stinging stuff the filth it chanced to find A root in (how it knew not, neither why) 'Mid shards, and scurf, and scum of every kind; Convinced it was promoting worthily The strenuous effort of almighty Jove A virgin nettle forest to create. 4. Meanwhile, the traveller in the room above Had finish'd the affair for which of late He had been lingering in that inn. The man Was (as the Fabulist forgot to state When he this Fable in hot haste began) A manufacturer in search of coal To feed his forges at the cheapest rate. And, having visited at last the whole Coal-bearing region, rummaged it about, And made his choice, now, wishing to get rid Of the rejected samples, he threw out (To join the other refuse that unchid Sprawl'd in the heat upon that heap of dung) The residue of his unclean collection. 5. By woeful luck there chanced to fall among That grimy clan, in their abrupt ejection, A heavy lump of carboniferous schist, Which flat upon the flowering nettle flopp'd; Whose crusht philosophy, collapsing, miss'd Benignant purpose in the blow that stopp'd Philosophising with a pang of pain. “Fatality, and malediction!” hiss'd The mangled weed with indignation vain, “What Demon rules this universe, and slays Without a purpose, making earth one hell? Blind Chance it is! and since blind Chance obeys No guiding law, methinks it might as well Have fall'n on either side of me, instead Of tumbling thus precisely on my head!” 6. Uttering this blasphemy the nettle died. But not before his gaze, fast growing dim, Had contemplated with a mournful pride The tumulary pile that cover'd him. For there he mark'd the impress of a plant Of perisht centuries. That antique print Of vegetable forms no more extant He took for epitaph, admiring in 't The grandeur of his race in days gone by, And “semper virens!” was his life's last sigh. MORAL. Self-Interest, whiles it prospers, aye believes Its profit the chief aim of Providence. And even death's sigil on the tomb deceives Its vanity with plausible pretence Of pride in nothingness, abasht no whit To join Hic Jacef to Hic incipit. XLIV. COGITO ERGO SUM. 1. “Whatsoever the names whereby men call things, I ponder, compare, and discriminate all things.” Whose speech? A philosopher's, say you, this? If so, then your error is great as his. 'Twas a Grocer's Balance that spoke that speech: His beam was rusty, his brass scales each Bumpt and bent; yet as proud he hung Over the cheating counter, slung From a bar screw'd fast to a greasy shelf, As if Themis had hung him aloft herself. For, having weigh'd all things (butter-pats, Snuff, cloves, coffee, and salted sprats), And determined their gravity, great or small, He believed that he understood them all. 2. “Now, man,” he resumed, with himself agreeing, “Is an incomplete and impulsive being, Who, judging of things as they seem to be, Would misjudge them all, were it not for me. But his a priori I soon put straight By the solid and readjusting weight Of my a posteriori test. If at first I feel for a while opprest By the force of the problem thought presents To my brain-pan loaded with arguments, Mine impulse anon is to soar above it, Contemplate, cogitate, calculate, prove it. For my reason ever inclines in me My will, which is for that reason free, To the truth, where I rest and am satisfied, Between the extremes upon either side. There the goal is gain'd, and why further go? Since I know that I think, what I think I must know, And thus perfect, at last, to the point I come With my formula cogito ergo sum.” 3. Those Weights which the Balance was pleased to call His arguments, being false weights all, Knew full well, and with secret glee, Mock'd at the trick of the whole machine, “For if Justice had only eyes to see, That rogue the Grocer had long since been Hang'd by the neck as he ought to be,” (These False Weights sneer'd with a surly spleen) “And thou shouldst have served for his gallows tree. Thou dost think, and so art? State the truth as it is, Thou dost fancy thou thinkest, and thinkest thou art. Be it so! It costs nothing to think that or this, And let each have his fancy. We, too, for our part, Have a notion 'tis worth not two penn'orth of twine, What thou art or thou thinkest. But spare us, we pray, That absurd ergotistical Ergo of thine, Which to others must sound disobliging if they Chance to be without thinking. For instance, to man, Who would surely not be what he is if he thought, And is right; for the main thing's to be, if one can, And to think about being is nutshell and naught. As for thee, if thou canst, thou canst do nothing better Than beget little scales, and take care that they be Each, if possible, just like its precious begetter, For the world's tongue is scandalous. So much for thee! For thine Ergo; not cogito, say, ergo sum, But to cogito rather subjoin ergo est, And, at least somewhat nearer the truth wilt thou come; To thy formula standing, but standing confest Sole creator of that idiotic creation Whose silly existence exists at the best In the depths of thine own idiotic sensation. And then as for thy will; it obeys the behest Of the motive that's strongest, a slave and a thrall To the force we all feel and yet none of us know. For the rickety tile that is ready to fall From the top of the roof if the wind blows high And be smasht to bits in the street below, First smashing the skull of some passer-by, Hath a will that's as free every whit as thine own, And the sense not, at least, to talk nonsense about it, Down it falls when it must, and it lies where 'tis thrown, By an impulse received from a pressure without it. That pressure's Necessity. What she pronounces Finds thee, too, like others, obedient enough. What is coffee? a pound of it weighs sixteen ounces, And so much, and no more, does a pound weigh of snuff. This alone, at the most, canst thou know after weighing it, And 'tis but the result of thou knowest not what. If thou sayest it, 'tis that thou canst not help saying it, And thou never wilt say a thing truer than that.” 4. Now a metal is iron as hard as nails, Practical, patient, not easily bored: But ideas it hates, and against them prevails, As we often have seen, at the point of the sword. Whilst the Balance uphung 'twixt the earth and the sky, And by nature responsive to every vibration, Hovers vague in a realm insubstantial and high Which seems made for the purpose of pure speculation. So that when “sixteen ounces of snuff are a poundweight,” The Weights cried below to the Balance above, Tho' he knew not, as we do, that this was unsound weight, He replied, with a shrug, “Well, and what does that prove?” Then, convinced that he had by this interrogation Their materialist insolence sternly put down, He return'd with a tremor of self-admiration To the point out of which the discussion had grown. 5. And so matters went on, until brought to a stop By a quite unforeseen and unpleasant event: When one day on the Grocer's iniquitous shop The Police made an inquisitorial descent; Which establish'd the fact that each weight was a light one, That the Balance had in it a tendency strong To incline to the side that was never the right one, And the Grocer had known of the trick all along. The Grocer was fined. The Police took possession Of the Balance and Weights. These the Law handed over To the anvil and hammer, that made an impression Upon them from which they will never recover. 6. In one sack of old iron regardlessly shaken Do Free Will and Necessity rust evermore. To a different system the Grocer has taken, And he cheats more ingeniously now than before. XLV. PHILOSOPHY OF THE LITTLE. Two cousins (they were but of distant degree, But blood's thicker than water, and each was a Flea) Met each other by chance. Bid not History tell (For the goings of Fleas are inscrutable) Whereabouts it was in their nightly walk The dark kinsmen, meeting, fell into a talk In the usual over-emphatic style Of friends who, when after a long, long while They meet unawares, in that unwill'd meeting Evince, by a nervously-cordial greeting, Keener care for each other's affairs Than they honestly feel. For if one of them wears A threadbare coat, though as warm perhaps As the weather in June be the breast it wraps, At the sight of it something shuts somewhere In the heart, like a door in a draught of air. Now one of these two was a fine fat Flea: To the other, a lean one, “Coz,” quoth he, In a tone of compassionate semi-suspicion “You seem to be terribly out of condition.” “Alas!” said the lean one, “friend, in me, The ruin'd though innocent victim you see Of one fatal error beyond recall. My means of life I invested all In the skin of an Ape. It was juicy and fat. I married in haste on the strength of that, Had a numerous family, daughters, sons, Nor was Flea ever father of fairer ones. Now wife and little ones, all are lost! Ah! had I but counted the care and cost, Or had I but dream'd of the danger and toil, When I settled first on that fertile soil! I confess my fault. I was taken in. Who could guess that an Ape has so ticklish a skin? The brute was prurient, and idle too, With nothing better all day to do Than scratch, scratch, scratch; you conceive the despair Of a flea whose whole livelihood hangs by a hair. But enough of the miseries I have gone thro'. My illustrious friend how much better with you, Has the world, since we parted, been wagging!” “So, so!” Complacently nodded the other. “I know Nothing much, on the whole, I can grumble about, Save a plaguy sharp twinge now and then of the gout. 'Tis the fruit of good fare and the life that I lead Which is pleasant enough.” “So it must be, indeed!” The lean Flea said with a hungry sigh. “But where are you living?” “Luxuriously With my friend the Lion.” “The Lion? alack!” The starveling stammer'd as he skipp'd back, “Have, then, his terrible claws and teeth Their use forgone? How! dwelling beneath Those dread conditions, hast thou possest A single moment of ease or rest?” Scornfully smiled the superior Flea. “What are his claws or his teeth to me? Leonine talons may tear wild bulls, They cannot fidget a flea. Fear dulls, O foolish cousin, thy feeble wit. Apes scratch themselves at each itching fit, And in public pick out their private fleas, Not resenting disgust if they get but ease. Thine own insignificance prudently trust. A lion bears nobly what nobleness must. Of a friend's experience this maxim learn, And I'll warrant you, Cousin, 'twill serve your turn: From a world of foes wouldst thou live exempt? Then shelter thyself in the world's contempt. 'Tis a fortune subscribed by all creatures for thee. Go, trade on it! safe—if thou art but a flea.” XLVI. MASTER AT HOME. PART I. In grateful memory of each gracious reference Made to them by the one and thousand stories Of Queen Scheherazade,—or duteous deference To him in whom its immemorial glories Their realm attain'd,—the Beasts decreed thy name Haroun Alraschid, to the bravest, best, And noblest of their kings—a king whose fame His title merited, as mightiest Of monarchs leonine. Nor e'er hath been That ancient realm so fair and flourishing At any time before or since, I ween, As when Haroun the Illustrious was King. That Royal lion, like his namesake, loved To roam, incognito, his realms by night, And if—at morn, what time it heedless roved, Some subject's stumbling footstep chanced to 'light Upon a heap of bones, or bloody fleece, Where, in the dark, the King of Beasts had been, Or if, upon the barks of drooping trees Some Beaver's tooth, calumniously keen, Had scored a scandalous chronicle,—what then? Who is exempt from scandal? Not the great. Are not the mighty paths of mighty men Strewn with such ugly traces of the fate Of little ones? And what's a sheep or two Lost in a lion's glory and renown? To his high name and famous title true, Fear'd and revered was the great Lion Haroun. But was he happy? Whosoe'er had seen The grace, the beauty, and the loveliness Of the young Lioness, Haroun's fair Queen, Could surely doubt not of the monarch's bliss: Limbs whose luxurious and majestic mould Seem'd by some mighty artist's magic hand Shaped into gliding form from flexile gold; And, what most won the heart of all the land, Oh, such a nameless charm of grace refined, In every movement, queenly feminine, Of the soft tail that, curving, swept behind, And scarcely stirr'd a single sandgrain fine With its light fringe, yet gave to all the rest Expression irresistibly enchanting; A charm by high-born dames alone possest. In short, no beauty to the queen was wanting. All female charms were hers: and she was his: But ah! the heart that every joy possesses Except one joy, if that one joy it miss, All joy in all it hath too often misses! Oft o'er the king's majestic brow would rise The wrinkling shadow of a secret care; Oft o'er the orbits of his fervid eyes The massive muscle swell'd as though it were Stung by a sudden inward irritation; Whilst restless swishings of the royal tail Gave momentary tokens of vexation; Which his proud soul allow'd not to prevail, But, with impatient toss of the large mane, Shook scornful off: then, with a yawn immense, Half of submission, half of deep disdain, Mixt with a supercilious somnolence, The wide jaws gaped, and he, as one resign'd To those small troubles which infest the great, Stretch'd slow his lordly limbs. The Court divined The Monarch's mood: anxieties of State! Oft, at the dead of night the antler'd Hart, Couch'd in the grass beside his spotted Doe, From restless dreams would tremulously start And, heedless, strike his ornamented brow All scared against the elm-tree's neighbouring bark; When from the far-off, deep-porch'd palace, borne Along the listening silence of the dark, Fierce cries of royal wrath and passionate scorn, And then the roaring fall, and heavy roll Of mighty ones with mighty ones contending Startled the poor stag's palpitating soul; His straddled slender legs beneath him bending. His spouse, too, hearing what he heard, half rose, Scared for a moment by that ominous sound: But, when her glance fell on the horned brows Of her good helpmate conjugally crown'd, She, with a slight toss of her dainty head, (Significant of pacified alarm) Settled again to sleep in her soft bed Safe hid among the forest herbage warm. And when, next morn, the Monarch sat in Hall, His mien was sombre and his mood irate, Matted and torn his mane, and swollen all His mighty limbs. Anxieties of State! PART II. The lordly Lion Haroun one day Beneath a shady wood, A solitary lounger lay In meditative mood. From public cares retired, But not from care releast, Of life, and all things, tired, The noble-minded beast Oft sadly sigh'd, the while he eyed The summer grass and flowers; And, sighing, heard each happy bird That piped from pleasant bowers To gratulate its brooding mate On June's unclouded hours. Then forth there came, from out of a vine That round an elm did range Her garlands green and globes of wine, A little creature strange. It was of the Monarch's million Loyal subjects, doubtless, one. But never before that minute Had the Monarch noticed the little creature; Uncouth of form, minute of feature, And yet, with something in it That seem'd to strike and harmonise With the cause of the Monarch's moody sighs; And the Lion's eye-glance tarried On the pinnacled house, with its painted face, Which, at a slow and a solemn pace, The Snail on his shoulders carried. Doubtless that tiny householder Guess'd not what kingly eye Did on his movements then confer Its royal scrutiny. For on, with smooth important motion, He paced, as though he had a notion That he was lord of all the way. His house upon his back he bore, And on his forehead standards four: Erect and proud were they. To him (thus travelling leisurely, Unconscious of the Lion's eye) Across the path made haste. Another, smaller, wayfarer, Swifter-footed, swarthier, And slim about the waist. Then these two mutes, perceiving each The other, in their native speech Did one another hail, And with familiar salutation Fell into close confabulation, The Emmet and the Snail. Haroun, the Lion, understood (As all good sovereigns do, or should) The dialects and languages Of his provincial subjects fully. And, glad to escape the weary stress Of thoughts morose and melancholy Which did just then his mind oppress, He hail'd with silent satisfaction The chance of finding some distraction In listening to the chatterings Of such small folk, on such small things As cabbage-leaves and pips of pine, And weather-changes, foul or fine; In short each ordinary matter Of such folk's ordinary chatter. PART III. The little Emmet shook his head: “O Caracol! O Caracol! The Spanish for snail is here used as a proper name. I would not be the King,” he said, “In such bad times.” (With prescient soul Haroun the Lion prick'd an ear.) “Why, neighbour, why?” said Caracol. “Ah, Caracol! ah, gossip dear,” The little Emmet still ran on, “You stay-at-home, you'll live and die, Not dreaming what great things are done In the great world. But, gossip, I Go gadding here and there, you know, And many a thing upon the sly I pick up that's worth knowing.” “How!” Quoth Caracol, “good gossip say, (I am, indeed, a perfect stranger To what you hint at,) tell me, pray, Is, then, the Empire now in danger? From what? Explain, friend, if you know, Domestic brawl, or foreign foe? A puissant King have we!” “No, Caracol—I'll tell you—no, From civic brawl, and foreign foe, The Empire still is free. But, ah! dear gossip, if you knew, You never said a thing less true— The King's not puissant.”—“He! What mean you, friend?” said Caracol. (Haroun suppress'd a scornful growl.) “I mean—upon my life, 'Tis true,” the Emmet said, “the King Can rule his states—rule everything, But his unruly wife. The King's not master of the Queen, She masters him. And, this I mean, That, master'd by his spouse, At home he is not puissant—nay, Not even—the plain truth to say— At home in his own house. I know a secret gallery All thro' the palace ('tis thereby I pick up odds and ends.) Ah, if you knew what goings on! What shocking, shocking things are done, What hosts of private friends The Queen receives upon the sly! Poor King! I'm sure I pity him.” Said Caracol, “And so do I!” The Snail's small optic nerve was dim With sympathetic moisture. “Why,” Sigh'd Caracol, “what's after all, Such greatness worth?” The Emmet small Resumed, “Without rebuff We rule, friend, you and I, our spouses, Nor fear to enter our own houses. Abroad, the King, indeed, looks great: All envy him his power and state. At home, he's small enough! “O Caracol! my Caracol! I would not, trust me, for the whole Broad realm that he calls his, Be that unhappy King.” “Nor I!” Said Caracol with glistening eye, “My house my castle is. And, gossip, you and I can say (What, ah! he cannot) day by day, Tho' not in palace dome, On purple couch, but humble bed, Each lays his undishonour'd head, ‘Master am I at home!’” PART IV. Roaring with wrath and outraged pride, Haroun, the lordly Lion, sprung. The little Emmet slipp'd aside, And hid himself the grass among. The Snail, who could not go so quick, Pull'd his four timorous standards down, Swallow'd himself, and (terror-sick) Was to a mere saliva grown. The royal Lion, in its base distress, The wretched creature saw, He could have crusht it into nothingness, With one stroke of his paw. In a cold sweat lay Caracol. No doubt, Master at home was he. But master of his home, he now found out, 'Twas harder far to be. Howbeit, happily for Caracol, Haroun the Lion, with a lion's whim, Or else a monarch's scornful self-control, Pass'd onward, musing, and so harm'd not him. “A worm,” the Lion mused, “an abject clot Of animated slime, that creeps infirm, Is lord in his own house...and I am not? Well...be it so! The worm is still a worm. I am a king. Bah !...burrow and crawl...become One with this earth's obscurest denizens, To be...as they are...each in his own home Master...of what? mere subterranean dens, Or flimsy tenements...where they abide, This—a sick jelly without even a spine, That—a grimed drudge?” And the great Lion sigh'd Sadly...“O Leontine! O Leontine!” XLVII. THE PLANE AND THE PENKNIFE. A little Penknife, with sore toil and pain, In unskill'd hands, was desperately trying To smooth a great rough plank against the grain. “Cease, little fool!” that frustrate labour spying, A Plane exclaim'd “I'll show thee how to do it!” And gallopading up and down, he raced Nimbly along the plank, as tho' he knew it And found the rough work pleasant to his taste. Like curdling foam, small shavings here and there Bubbled; and where the swift Plane flitted o'er The hard wood, waxing bald, its shaven hair In yellow ringlets floated to the floor; Leaving reveal'd, in delicate design, The section'd surface of each wavy vein And rosin-colour'd ring with fringes fine. Then, proudly pausing, “There now!” cried the Plane. “How shall I ever thank thee, friend, enough?” The Penknife, much admiring, made reply, And from his tender blade some notches rough He wiped, like teardrops from a grateful eye. “Thou shalt not thank me, little fool, at all; But do thy proper work as I do mine.” The Plane in accents magisterial Said to the Penknife. “Carve thou figures fine “In lucid maple; or, at most essay Thy tender tooth on the ambitious box, That deems himself as brave, in his own way, As elephantine ivory. On blocks “Of his unfeatured flesh do thou engrave Rare pictures delicate with dainty lines. To beautify some poet's gentle page, Or solace Science with mysterious signs: “Or round about some richly-foliaged frame Wreath, rope, and cherub, sculpture, gay with gold, To enshrine the image of a high-born dame Limn'd by the painter's peerless art of old. “For this thou canst do, and this cannot I. And in our family the rule holds good That each must do his best to justify Steel's born superiority to wood. “The Axe, our father, in the forest wages Stout battle with the centenary oaks; And they, the giants of a hundred ages, Sink groaning underneath his sturdy strokes. “Ho! ho! the crash, when the old warrior goes In at them, and their rattling harness, plied By his reiterated ponderous blows, Bursts into faggots! That is iron's pride. “The Saw, our mother, when she's set agoing Goes thro' it bravely, with a right good will. Once let her show her teeth, and there's no knowing What dust she'll make about her in the mill. “The lazy trees that lounged about the wood And scarce bestirr'd themselves the whole day long, She turns to trusty planks for service good. I, the strong firstborn of our parents strong, “Less strong than they are, am yet strong enough To finish the good work by them begun. Too tender thou art for such labour tough. Thou, brother, thou, the old couple's youngest son, “Since strength thou hast for nothing else, be thou At least an artist. We are of the few Born each, to make a mark i' th' world, and show There's metal in us. To thy birth be true.” MORAL. Plain-spoken the Plane is, And somewhat o'erweening But noble his strain is, Since noble its meaning. Noble utility Only is able To boast the nobility Praised in this fable. XLVIII. THE DRAG AND THE WHEEL. 1. Click! clack! with a whoop and a whack! The way is white, and the woods are black. Thro' glare and gloom, now in now out, What are the dust and noise about? In the cloud o' the dust, in the clear o' the day, What is it comes from the hills this way, Creaking, reeking, heavy and hot, Downward, townward, What is it? What? 2. The road is steep from the mountain-tops: Zigzag, lower and lower, it drops, Slanting, sidling, fantastically Down to the inn by the brook in the valley; Whence it runs straight as a road can run, Half in the shadow and half in the sun. 3. Rumbling, grumbling, lumbering slow, With a hi-gee-up! and a hi-gee-wo! In the white o' the dust, in the heat o' the day, 'Tis a loaded wagon that comes this way. And its heavily-harness'd horses four Pant and smoke as they stop at the door Of the roadside inn, to rest them awhile; For the team, since morn, hath been many a mile. 4. While the grooms were giving the horses drink, The wagoner loosen'd the ponderous link, Lifted the glowing Drag, and again Hung him up by his iron chain Behind the wagon, 'twixt wheel and wheel. 5. That Drag was shodden with stoutest steel; But his rusty shoe was half worn away By the flinty ruts which had day by day Been rubbing him bare, as, clutching it still, He carried his wagon-load safe down hill. 6. So now, as he swung there high and dry, “Ouf!” groan'd he, “what a drudge am I! 'Tis a pretty sort of a life I lead! Bearing the burden and staying the speed Of a wagon with ten good loads at least, Of timber atop! each stupid beast Tugging away the more for me, And the stupid wheel, with its bandy knee Dug into my ribs, still doing its best To be turning round when it ought to rest! And what reward have I had of it yet? Do good to others, small thanks you get! For, look at these useless Wheels here (nay, Useless, said I? far worse are they!) If they had their will they would soon upset Wagon, and timber, and all! And yet Tho' the wagon is saved by my wise prevention, It is only they that receive attention. Do their spokes fall out? they are reinstated. Do their axles creak? they are lubricated, Greased, and eased, and coax'd to be quiet. Do their tires fall off? they get new ones by it, And go braced with a bran-new iron band, Brave as (bright arm'd by his lady's hand) Some knight sallies forth to the tournament, Whiles I, each bone of whose back is bent In their service, wearing myself away, Get never a thank-you night or day For the care without which (woe is me!) Soon would the wagon in pieces be.” 7. One of the Wheels to the Drag replied: “Moderate, prithee, thy boastful pride, Thou who dost moderate other folk's speed, Doing naught else in the world, indeed! Times (I acknowledge it) now and then Happen to us, as they happen to men, When our virtues are, for a while, defects. But 'tis so with the world's best intellects; And those times are rare. I have heard men say There be water-wagons, whose perilous way Is over the sea. When it blows great gales, Their wagoners then take in the sails, And throw out the anchor; putting the drag on, And stopping the wheels of the water-wagon. But say, are the sails no use at sea? Is the anchor the sole thing needed? We Are as good by land as, by sea, the sails: And, as good as the anchor is for the gales, Is the Drag for the hill-sides—going down. But the gales and the hills are exceptions, own! To each his merit; but none need brag. More often the Wheel is of use than the Drag, As you'll see in a minute.” 8. The beasts were fed: The wagoner jump'd on the wagon, and said, “All right!” and away with no fear of a fall, Started the wagon, and horses and all, At a brisk merry trot o'er the long low road That wound thro' the valley, so smooth and broad. The dust flew up, and the sparks flew out, The wagoner smack'd his whip with a shout, “Hu! hu!” and the wheels went round: 'Twas a pleasure to see them get over the ground. 9. Their motion, mockingly, made the Drag Like a pendulum this way and that way wag. He seem'd, with a shrug of contempt, to say, “Prithee Go along, silly world, and the devil go with thee! Hustle me! justle me! flout me still! My turn will come—at the turn of the hill.” 10. He was right. His turn came round at last: And pass'd away—when the hill was past. XLIX. A HAUGHTY SPIRIT BEFORE A FALL. PART I. 1. “Blind, blind is fate! unjust and hard my lot, Who bear the burden of oblivious days Unnoticed and uncheer'd from spot to spot By dull and difficult ways! How enviably doth the blissful bird Bathe her free life in sunshine and sweet air, Earth's lightest elements, and undeterr'd Roam the wide welkin! There Sublime she wanders with delighted mind Thro' heaven's high glories—I but guess, debarr'd From contemplation of them. Fate is blind, Unjust my lot, and hard!” 2. Thus, tired by slow and weary pilgrimage Along a short, smooth, easy road, complain'd A Tortoise; resting ere the last long stage To his near goal was gain'd. Head, feet, and tail i' the dust, he lay spread out Self-crucified, a star that no light gave. Deep-buried in himself, he bore about His own life's living grave. Yet dream'd he ever of a great existence, Where, in lone lorddom over sea and land, Sun-crown'd and girdled with the azure distance The monarch mountains stand. 3. Then suddenly the ambitious dreamer found His sordid life uplifted. Like his mind Sublime his body soar'd. His native ground Sank as he rose i' the wind. And underneath the wide world opens round him. The silvery windings of the waters shine Like little sinuous snakes. No limits bound him Save the broad heavens divine. The sprawling woods that seem'd immeasurable Clump themselves into definite dark shapes. The light green meadows lengthen. Skyward swell Grey curves of mountain capes. Deep in cold hollows of extinguisht fire Sleep the intense blue tarns. Sharp points of snow Glitter, and valleys green with ice-fields, higher Than other green things grow. The pure caress of airs, tho' keen not harsh, Cool in the calm of that etherial height Fan the delighted dweller of the marsh, Thrill'd by unwonted flight. A second Ganymede some second Jove, Seeking for beauty here on earth misknown, In him hath haply found, and borne above To the Olympian Throne. So deem'd the dupe of his own blind ambition, And cried, “O my prophetic soul, at last The Gods repent! Accepting Fate's contrition, I do forgive the past.” PART II. 1. And tho', indeed, no Ganymede The beast was, yet 'tis true That Jove's own bird on him conferr'd This god-like point of view. For, as of old, some bandit bold, Baulk'd of his promised prey (The Bishop's self with bags of pelf) Might grumbling bear away The Bishop's Fool whose limping mule Belated lags behind, So, missing aim at nobler game, An Eagle chanced to find The torpid beast; unfit to feast His Eaglet brood, but still A trifling toy which they, for joy And not for food, might kill. 2. As in the Eagle's claw The Tortoise upward sail'd, His flight a Swallow saw, And, “O beware!” she wail'd, “Against thy nature's law Why hast thou rashly rail'd? Poor denizen of dust, Confide not in the fate Which doth exalt, and must Destroy, thee soon or late. Be warn'd in time: mistrust The contact of the great.” “Error!” that dupe replied. “The patron who in me My latent genius spied Respects it, tho' it be By unjust gods denied What they bestow'd on thee. Thanks to his recognition, I lack no longer now The long-desired condition Which gives to such as thou Their freedom, and position Above the world. I know That on the restoration To me, and to my race, Of that exalted station Which we were born to grace, Depends the whole creation. Till then all's out of place.” PART III. 1. And, tho' his listener long ago was gone, And to the empty air he spoke alone, Still he continued, with important tone. 2. “Scorn not the form by dædal ages made For my adornment and the world's devotion, In symbol of the fixt foundation laid For the world's motion! The first word of creation was Testudo, And all was in the word. My sire grandæval Bore on his back (as easily as you do Chafer or weevil In beak or claw) the elephant gigantic, Who bore the whole world's weight upon his own. Wild Change, the revolutionary antic, Was then unknown; Then, based on principle, the world stood fast; And when the changing world to changeless me Repentant turns, then all shall rest at last Where all should be. You others are as wanton as the weather, Respecting naught. But truth survives neglect. I wait, and hug myself, and keep together My self-respect. Who knows? The old Saturnian times return: Order I bring, and peace, to earth again, When tipsy Fortune from her tilted urn Shakes down”.... Just then His evil star, on which he had not reckon'd, Wink'd, and a Hare into the open beckon'd. The Eagle spied the tempting prey, Unclasp'd his claws, and, well-a-day! As swift as crash Succeeds to flash, When thunder-clouds together clash, A swooning fall, a sounding smash! And on the earth, it was his vain Tho' brave ambition to sustain, Shatter'd the Tortoise lay. PART IV. The friend that warn'd him in his hour of pride His downfall spied. The modest bird, with fondly flutter'd breast, Flew to the nest Which she, who throws in sport o'er sea and land (Beneath it spann'd) The aëry bridge so exquisitely light Of her bold flight, Builds, safely shelter'd under low-thatch'd eaves, Of clay and leaves. There did she mourn, “Mistaken aspiration Is self-damnation. He who himself hath misappreciated, Is twice ill-fated. For what his nature never may attain He pines in vain, Whilst in his natural home, whate'er it be, A stranger he! Ah, hadst thou known the world as well as I, Ne'er from on high Wouldst thou have fallen, but hadst lived content As nature meant. Thee doth desire impel to thine unrest, Me to my nest.” L. THE ROSE AND THE BRAMBLE. There was a garden—no matter where— The world is full of such gardens. There Flowers of all colour and odour grew; And, whatever their odour, whatever their hue, The gardener gave to them each alike What for each was good. In congenial ground He set each seedling to shoot and strike; Each sprout he cherish'd and water'd round With the self-same vigilance everywhere, Tended each bud with the self-same care; And, nevertheless, in colour and scent, They came up, all of them, different. Each had something that best became it: Each had some quality fair and fit: Each had a beauty whereby to name it: Each had a merit to praise in it. One by its leaf, and one by its stem, This by its colour, and that by its smell, These by their blossomy diadem, And those by their fruit, did the rest excel. But when that garden was open'd, those Who walk'd there, turn'd, as they wander'd by, With one accord to admire the Rose; And the rest of the flowers could guess not why. For “Each flower's a flower,” they all averr'd, “And the Rose is only a flower we know.” Now the praise bestow'd on the Rose most stirr'd The surprise of a Bramble that happen'd to grow Quite close to the Rose. And he said, “We have grown, Since we were seeds in the same soil sown, Ever together, the Rose and I; And I never could find out yet, I own, What there is in her to catch men's eye. However next Spring, it shall be my duty To find the Rose's secret out.” The Bramble felt not the Rose's beauty, And he thought, “'Tis her manner of growing, no doubt. One has but to notice and do the same.” So the Bramble, as soon as the next Spring came, Noticed; and saw that the Rose's stem Was all cover'd with thorns; and “Oh ho!” quoth he, “'Tis the thorns that do it! But we'll beat them, And the world shall see what the world shall see.” Then, by checking the natural circulation Of his proper sap in a few May morns The Bramble, ambitious of admiration, To imitate Roses put forth thorns. Yet still, as before, to admire the Rose The folk pass'd by him. “Good folks,” cried he, “These thorns of mine are more sharp than those That roughen the rosebush. Turn, and see!” But nobody heard what the Bramble cried, Or a passing glance of approval cast him. Then, to catch the notice, the Bramble tried, By catching the skirts, of all who pass'd him. Which attempt succeeded too well, indeed. For the folk then noticed the Bramble, crying, “Gardener, away with this troublesome weed, Which tears our clothes!” And the gardener, spying The cause of complaint, “Not in all my life Was I ever disgraced before,” he said, “By such a sad eyesore!” whipping his knife Out of his pocket; and soon, half dead, With his feelers all by the roots uptorn, On the other side of the garden wall Was the luckless Bramble flung forlorn, To fare as he might there, thorns and all. The Bramble ruefully shook his head, And “What in the world does it mean?” he said. “May I be blighted if I can see What the difference is 'twixt the Rose and me! One thing alone have I understood: That what in a Bramble is taken ill In a Rose is reckon'd all fair and good. But the reason why is a mystery, And of vying with Roses I've had my fill.” Then the Bramble crawl'd away to the wood: And there in the wood you may find him still. LI. DUCUNT VOLENTEM FATA: NOLENTEM TRAHUNT. 1. A man, who lack'd even means to make amends By health and hope for lack of wealth and friends, Having no tie to life save pain's harsh tether, Resolved to end both pain and life together; And leapt into a river to fulfil That woeful purpose, when, against his will, Another man, rich, happy, hopeful, young, Whilst listening to the bridal bells that rung Blithe recognition of his marriage morn, Fell into the same river. Both were borne Adown the stream; whose wave, indifferent To different causes, rolling onward went To reach the same effect; regardless which It drown'd the first, the poor man or the rich. 2. A Sage, who happen'd to be passing by, And saw those two men drowning, was thereby Thrown into a long train of thoughts, profound And rapid as that river. At one bound, The recollection that he could not swim Came in the first thought that occurr'd to him. The second from the first as swiftly flow'd As wave from wave, and, by reflection, show'd, Concerning those two miserable men, Who to their deaths were drifting close in ken, That, if he tried to help them, there might be, Instead of only two drown'd bodies, three. His third thought was, that 'twas no use at all To run in search of aid, or even call, Since, long ere aid could reach them, even if found, The wretches must infallibly be drown'd. His fourth thought, which at once he acted on, As being the sole thing proper to be done Without delay, was to elucidate To these two victims of the force of fate Fate's ways, by force of prudent precept. Now, Tho' how to swim he knew not, he knew how To talk in Latin. That was his profession. And, (being himself in safe and sound possession Of all his wits) as loud as he was able, He, in the words which introduce this Fable, “Ducunt volentem fata,” with a shout, “Nolentem trahunt,” from the bank bawl'd out. 3. And was it chance, or was it intuition? Vast were the treasures of his erudition; But from the stores of truths which he possess'd (The one half serving to refute the rest) That Sage, by dint of long and deep reflection, Could not have made a luckier selection, For, whilst Philosophy thus took her stand Calm, as became her, upon good firm land, The truth which she proclaim'd, (put out no whit By plentiful cold water pour'd on it) Her influence proved; awakening there and then In the damp'd spirits of those drowning men, This thought: that, if Fate treats the self-same way The willing and unwilling, whether they Resist or yield, the end's the same end still, And bootless both, to will or not to will. Its next result inverted that conviction, Proving the force of truth by contradiction, Philosophy's chief triumph! Thus, the first Of those two men, who, with a will athirst For sudden watery annihilation, Had jump'd into the river,—tho' natation Was not to him an art unknown, forewent it, Letting his body, as the current sent it, Drift will-less down the water, and from volens Became, comparatively speaking, nolens. The other, who was in the same position Against his will, exerting strong volition, Tax'd all his wits to compensate to him The sad chance of not knowing how to swim; Call'd to his mind the bride who now no doubt Was wondering what her bridegroom was about, Imaged her loss in his; and, fortified By fond emotions, strove against the tide With such a vigorous valour that at length He reach'd, and caught, and clutch'd with all his strength, The lean arm of a weeping willow tree; Which o'er the water stoop'd, and seem'd to be Already making solemn preparation For his appropriate funeral oration. Tho' much it wept, the willow's nerves were strong: The man, meanwhile, cried lustily and long. And, since 'twas not in Latin that he cried, But that plain language everywhere employ'd By living creatures to express joy, pain, Or need, a ploughman on the neighbouring plain Heard him; and, understanding from the sound That some one was unwilling to be drown'd, Ran to the rescue. 4. Much at the same time The first man floated to a bank of slime Insensible, and stuck there: by and by Came to himself again: sprawl'd up: shook dry His dripping rags: and, as the latest word Which, ere his senses left him, he had heard Was said in Latin, shivering as he dried him, The wretch sigh'd ruefully “Non bis in idem!” Then clamber'd to the shore with trailing tread, Slunk home, and sank, unsupper'd, into bed.— There, long in miserable plight he lay, Rack'd by an aguish fever night and day. But, since he could not pay the doctor's fees, Gratis the man recover'd by degrees. And now, one miracle another follow'd; For by the last disease the first was swallow'd, Just as one nail drives out another one. Feeling his health and strength restored, anon, Ere he set out in search of work, the man To brush and clean his sand-caked clothes began. When, lo you, yet another miracle! The best of all. For, glittering as they fell, The grains of sand that off his garments roll'd Were mixt with grains of veritable gold. The poor man sought the well-remember'd bank Which for his cold, and gold, he had to thank. 'Twas all auriferous. He tested it, But kept the secret—and the gold, till bit By bit a little capital he got. Therewith the bank he bought, and on the spot Built workshops, hiring out of many a land Workmen to wash the wealth from that rare sand. Plenteous the profit was, since pure the gold. And thus the man, at last, grew rich—and old. 5 One day, came, footsore, from a distant Shire A workman asking work. Well worth his hire The stranger proved. A sober man was he, Hard-working, honest. Tho' he seem'd to be By something nobly mournful in his mien For better fortunes born, yet staid, serene, And silent, he his daily taskwork plied. With curious gaze full oft the master eyed This stranger: whom one day, when work was done, He sought, and, at the setting of the sun, Found by the river bank, with tearful eye Watching a willow tree that wept thereby. “Thou sufferest, honest friend?” the good man cried. “I, too, have suffer'd. Trust me.” Faintly sigh'd The other (answering not) “O willow tree Ducunt volentem fata ... woe is me ... Nolentem trahunt!” Much surprised to hear Those words, once heard before with drowning ear, The master ask'd, and learn'd, at last, what we Already know. With this much more: that she For whose sake this poor wretch had saved his life That life had fill'd with misery, shame, and strife, And at the last had left him, leaving not, To reconcile him to his ruin'd lot, Fortune or friends. Thus had he lived to hate That luckless hour when he, at strife with fate, Had won the victory. “Friend, forget the past!” The master cried. “In mine a home thou hast. Nor wife have I, nor children. Be mine heir. Who art mine only kinsman, I declare. For kinsfolk of a sort we needs must be, Two fishes out of the same water, we!” Then, when the other hesitated, “Nay,” He added, laughing, “Fate will have her way. So, nolens volens, it must needs be so. Shake hands upon it. There's no saying no, When Fate saith ay.” 6. Conversing thus, the two Whom Fate so strangely had united now By land, as once by water, by and by Bethought them of the Sage who from on high, When each was floundering in the flood below, Had graciously vouchsafed to let them know A truth; which he, for the occasion, took From Seneca; who stole it from the book Of some Greek Poet; who had borrow'd it From some one else; to whom some other Wit Had lent it first. So, forth the two friends set To find the Sage to whom they owed this debt. Him, after fruitless search for many a day, They found, when he was being borne away To his last resting-place. Where, as 'tis fit, This story also ends. No fable it; Albeit not on that account a fact; Since every fable must have to it tackt Some sort of moral. But such tales as these May serve for morals, if their readers please, To all those fabulous things which so confound us By really happening in the world around us. LII. SUUM CUIQUE. 1. It was the hour when woods are cold And there is no colour in all the sky, Because night's blue is gone, and the gold O' the dawn not coming till by and by: It was the hour when vapours white Are over the dark meer rolling slow From the brewage brew'd by the water-sprite Who inhabits the sunless deeps below. 2. In the reed and rush, 'twixt meer and fen, Two wild white Swans were fighting then; For a wild white Swan-Bride fighting keen; The lake's two lords for the lake's one queen. And altho' both woo'd her, but one could wed, And but one be victor, tho' both fought well. And the vanquisht warrior, wounded, fled Foom the wrath of his rival peer, and fell, Over the reed-fenced rivage damp, Into the filth of the fenny swamp; Whence the sound of his funeral hymn rose clear From the marsh to the woodland, and over the meer. 3. Thro' the reeds he crushes, from the forest rushes The bristly bulk of the fierce Wild Boar; Crashing down bud and bush, pashing the mud and slush, And scattering filth from his cleft feet four. And “Who is it that calleth for help?” quoth he. “Here, all who enter my subjects be. Let the wronger beware! and, if fight he can, Fight for his life, or fly with speed! Eh, ... but, bless my bristles! ... a Swan? And, if I mistake not, a Swan indeed! Welcome, Cousin! Allow me, pray, To ask what weather blew you this way? Or is it, O lord of the lucid lake, (Thou stateliest swimmer!) that thy white neck Is weary of watching each snowy flake Of its whiteness imaged without a speck In the over-perfect purity And tedious calm of the crystal flood? And hast thou, too, learn'd, at last, to sigh For the common, but more congenial, mud? Hah! by each buffalo's cloven crest In the herd of them put to flight by me, I swear (for I love thee, noble guest!) I will share mine acorn crops with thee, If thou, contented, a swine with swine, Wilt change those too-white plumes of thine For the bristles and hair We hogs do wear. Already, thy haughty beauty wanes! Fallen, tho' unresign'd, art thou. And the spurted slime of the fen's drench stains That princely bosom of spotless snow. Thou that immaculate swammest the meer, Wallow in mud, and be welcome, here!” 4. Bleeding, aching, weary, and wan, Bitterly listen'd the noble swan, To those brutal words; and “O shame and grief! He moan'd, “that in such a place—to me— And with such a speech—the ignoble chief Of an obscene herd should dare to proffer His fulsome friendship filthy and free, And a swan be shamed by a swinish offer!” 5. With failing breath, On the threshold of death, By an effort vast (His saddest and last) He arose; and, quickly Staunching his wound With the grasses sickly That grow on such ground, Sprang forward; crying “St Pelican! I die; but, in dying, Am still a swan! St Pelican hear me, And grant my cry! In death be near me, And let me die As I lived, at least, A swan, not a beast, In mine own pure element's purity!” 6. The Saint reprieved him. The wave received him, And, washing the stain from each wounded limb, On his deathbed bathed and rebàptised him. 7. Then, backward turning his stately head, On the haunts of those he had scorn'd and fled He gazed; and saw with a dying eye Afar in the forest the filthy herd, Profaning its sacred groves, rush by; And the mirth of the wallowing monsters heard. And “Each to his own!” the Wild Swan said, “And his own to each! and I to mine! As the Swan to his purity, so to his bed In the mud he was born for, returneth the Swine. For, if a Swan fall in the filth of the fen Where the dew turns slime and the green grows sallow, And even the strong foot slips, what then? He doth but fall where the Swine doth wallow. Suum cuique, To live or die: Hic et ubique A Swan am I!” LIII. THE TWO TRAVELLERS; OR, LOVE AND DEATH. We are not made for Beauty, nor for Love, Nor for Eternity, Perchance. But something in us, from above, Yearns to embrace all three. Lost in a silent land of winter wild, Where, warming nothing, yet on all things smiled The eternal snows that lit that lonesome land, Two weary travellers wander'd, staff in hand, Over the frozen hills. Fast friends, together They two had fared thro' fortune's changing weather; And each had loved; and each life's common chance Had curst with war 'twixt love and circumstance. But in that conflict, one to love, that claim'd, Had yielded, all: whilst one life's fate had freed From love's embrace; and, struggling forward, maim'd In every feeling, saved, not all, indeed, But all mere life hath left when love is dead, And dead, with love, life's sense of lovely things. Now, as they wander'd weary, round them spread (To make more weary still their wanderings) Endless tranquillity. And all the while Above them, and about them, everywhere Along the land and in the leafless air, Throughout that region of unblest repose They felt the fixt unsympathising smile Of the eternal snows. It was the smile of Eternity, That smileth, whether men live or die. Every sorrow, and every joy, Every pleasure, and every pain, Hath something—it may be, all—to dread. But, with nothing to lose, and nothing to gain, Eternity smileth the smile of the dead. “I have seen the Sphynx in the Desert” said To his fellow-pilgrim one of the twain, “And the smile upon Nature's face, methinks, Is as the smile on the face of the Sphynx: The smile of indifference! Death smiles so, And so smiles Love—on the loss and woe That waste the hearts of his human prey When, having o'erwhelm'd them, he passeth away As they sink in dust, to smile down for ever From his unattainable heaven so high On the generations, whose foil'd endeavour Cannot interpret, however it try, Nor answer, save by a feverish sigh, That inscrutable smile, with its unsad Never! For Love is Love, for aye, as of old: And, Spring by Spring, as the leaves unfold, Lives shall blossom in Love's strong sun That beameth for all, and abideth for none. But Life is mortal, tho' Love be not, And Death is, was, and shall be. And Nature heeds not her children's lot, A wanton mother is she! Friend, I am tired, and can no further fare. Here will I rest.”—“Ah, madman!” cried the other, “Here is but Ruin with Rest's face. Beware! Shake off this fatal lethargy, my brother! 'Tis Death that woos, and not Repose, The weary and unwise To his cold couch in these deep snows. Poor wretch, arouse! arise! Some succour, sure, must be at hand, Some issue from this dreadful land. For lo! where leans yon woodland high Along the windless air, Some woodman's hut methinks I spy, Or charcoal-burner's rude repair, A smoke is in the frosty sky. Deliverance must be near!” “Ah, brother, prithee let me be.” His comrade answer'd. “Whither flee? Deliverance! ... dost thou seek it? See, 'Tis at our feet—’tis here!” And, as he spake, he sank. With a shrill cry The other turn'd, and fled: from peak to peak Springing, and clinging, dizzily, foot and hand. The upland forest, heavy, huge, and high, Seem'd slipping o'er him from its icy shelves. And, wildly mocking the man's human shriek, With most inhuman revelry, Outleapt the echoes of that lonesome land, Like mad malignant elves. O'er the giddy steeps he climbs, he leaps, And his breath is salt with blood. And there's blood in the skies—or blood in his eyes— As, with reeling steps, and choking cries, And broken strength, he reaches, at length, The Woodman's hut in the wood. And his voice doth seem like a voice in a dream When he shouts and beats at the Woodman's door, Faint and blind as a wasted wind That beats its life out, trying to find Its lost way over a moor. “Ope, Woodman! ope For charity! Help! help! a rope, A hand! Hard by On the nether slope Doth my comrade lie, Lost, if no hope Of help be nigh, For I can no more. Wake, Woodman! wake, And open the door For Jesu's sake!” “Come hither! come hither!” the Woodman cried To his four sons, “and bear him inside, And pile him a bearskin bed, And cut the boots from his swollen feet. These famisht pulses feebly beat, But the poor wretch is not dead.” So the Foresters chafed him, limb by limb, Till, feebly, again, in each frozen vein The life-blood ran; and the rescued man Felt Death's fingers releasing him. His lips they bathed in the cordial cup, And, alive at last, they lifted him up; But leaving in Death's grip, lost and gone Life's ransom—claim'd by the hungry cold, Which had bitten his flesh to the very bone, So that what remain'd of the man thus saved Was a ruin—horrible to behold, On whose living flesh Death's mark was graved. Then this living half of the half-saved man The search after his lost friend began, Whom he, and the Foresters, found at last Sunk in the drifted snow, beneath That desolate upland vague and vast, Dead—but beautiful in death. And over the dead man's face was cast The smile of the Sphynx: that smile which is The smile of indifference. Seeing this, He that saw it recall'd the past. When, long since, they twain were young, And, as together they journey'd along Life's unknown, and yet untried, way Love o'ertook them, and seized his prey, The dead man there, now calm, and fair, With a mighty effort had broken Love's snare, Giving to him, the survivor now, The self-same counsel, to struggle on, He, himself, had refused, when he sank in the snow, And gave up the ghost ere the goal was won. Not so of yore! when, with tears, he tore His tortured spirit from Love's control, But thus left for ever behind him, lost, The finest and fairest parts of his soul, Saving the rest of himself at their cost. Now, he lay dead, with the smile on his face. Dead, but unblemisht, and fair in death, And, over his features calm, the grace Of a peace unbroken by mortal breath. Maim'd in feature, and crippled in limb, The living man look'd down upon him; And, fair, in the dead man's face (with awe Because of its careless beauty) he saw The image serene of his own dead soul. Dead—but in death still beautiful! LIV. AN ILL-ASSORTED COUPLE. 1 There was a couple who could not agree, Tho' conjoin'd by a fate they were forced to obey. And of one of that couple the name was He, And the name of the other did He call They. 2 Different in age, as in all, were the two; The youngest He, and yet ages old; They even older, and short of view, As of hearing hard, if the truth be told. 3 He was resolved (and some sages say It is man's best study) to study himself; Taking small heed of his yokemate. They Spared no abuse of the self-will'd elf. 4 “He,” said They, “is the bitterest brute! A bear,—and his bearish actions show it.” Which opinion settled beyond dispute, 'Twas a miracle only could overthrow it. 5 But falling sick, and recovering slowly, He grew as tame as a brute could be; And, his rebel habits reforming wholly, Meek and mild as a lamb was He; 6 Doing whatever a lamb can do To evince the virtues for which man love it: Whilst They, disinclined to opinions new, Cried “He is a bear, and his actions prove it!” 7 Hard of hearing, and short of sight, Thus They took ... was it ten years, or more? To discover that all was at last lamb white In the blackness so bearishly black before. 8 Truth, however, will find her way To the dullest brain, if you grant her time; And so after thus chiming its ten years, They Changed of a sudden this chiding chime. 9 “He,” at last said They, with no doubt at all, “Is the sweetest soul. We have wrong'd him, we. And that was but honey we took for gall.” Meanwhile (what was it sour'd him?) He, 10 Because He had tried and had fail'd to please, Or because of original sin, once more, A backslider, became by unblest degrees, The unsocial bear he had been before. 11 Yet “He,” cry They, and still go on crying, “Is the sweetest soul, and his actions show it!” Do They believe it, or are They lying? One thing only is sure. I know it. 12 Between a man and his reputation There is a space to be travell'd thro': And when rumour reaches its destination The tale it tells is no longer true. 13 Each ray of the star you are praising to-night Hath been long on its way to your world below: And your praises, perchance, are bestow'd on the light Of a star that hath perish'd an age ago. LV. BETWEEN HAMMER AND ANVIL. (A SONG OF THE IRON AGE.) 1 The bellows, breathing, fann'd the forge: Forth sprang the thrill'd white sparks in throngs: The Young Smith from the furnace gorge Pluck'd out between his pinching tongs, And flat on the resonant anvil laid, The red iron, ablush with a radiant glow: The Old Smith, dealing it blow on blow, With his ponderous hammer the hot mass bray'd. 2 And, whilst about it son and sire In mutual mirth their business plied, The iron, weeping tears of fire, To hammer and to anvil cried “It is iron ye be, yet, O torturing two, It is iron ye torture!” But “Suffer thy lot,”— They replied to him, “fool, and upbraid us not; For there's some one above us is dealing the blow.” 3 Oh had the Old Smith, whirling fast His hammer, heard that talk? For, gay He, thro' the roar o' the furnace blast, Laugh'd “Divide et impera!” “Ámen! Ámen!” the iron replied, giving vent To a groan, as it grew to a sword. This, anon, To its place in the arsenal pass'd: and the son Of the Old Smith into the army went. 4 One day the town's bad blood broke out. The artizans arose in arms: The Civic Guard they put to rout, And fill'd the streets with fierce alarms. But the soldiers came cantering into the town: And, with patriot pride in so loyal a job, Slashing this way and that as he rode thro' the mob, A young soldier by chance the ringleader cut down. 5 “My son!” the giant gasp'd; and heard, As grovelling in his gore he lay, A captain, who had given the word, Laugh “Divide et impera!” “Ámen ! Ámen !” the Old Smith responded; and died As the Young Smith, unnoticing, flourish'd his sword. Revolution was ended and order restored By the youth's unintentional parricide. 6 The King then went to war. Long while His stricken subjects rued that day. The foeman gain'd by gold and guile One half the misruled realm away. Thus, against itself upon all sides turn'd, Did the gash'd land bleed at each gaping pore: They but meant it well, the two armies swore: Meanwhile they ravish'd, and robb'd, and burn'd. 7 And in the last great fight of all The Old Smith's soldier son expired. His ribs were broken by a ball From his old Captain's pistol fired. But, before the last breath of his life he breathed, He resolved, at the least, not to breathe it in vain; And the sword that erewhile had his father slain In the breast of his leader lost he sheathed. 8 The conquering General rode that way, Glowing and fierce as Mars' own Flamen, Laugh'd “Divide et impera!” And gallop'd onward. “Ámen! Ámen!” With a finger sly on his Golden Fleece, (While the General gave his moustache a twist) Responded the smiling Diplomatist Commission'd to settle and sign the Peace. 9 The Peace was sign'd: and, having wrought The conquest thus confirm'd, elate, The Military Party thought Itself the master of the State. But the Diplomat, hiding his own intent, The Generals, jealous and fierce, inflamed With a rival hope; and the fools proclaim'd A Republic; that chose him as President. 10 For, whilst with faction faction fought, The moderate man slipp'd in between; The votes of either party bought, And baulk'd them both. More calm and keen Than the rival chiefs that around him vied, When the popular choice he had charm'd away The rogue laugh'd “Divide, impera!” Praising himself with a secret pride. 11 Yet, tho' so soft the whisper'd word He, laughing in his sleeve, let fall, Its secret boast one listener heard; Who, unobserved, observing all, Behind him stood with a downcast eye, And a serious smile on a meek lip set, As “Ámen!” he mutter'd, and softlier yet “Ámen!” again, to his rosary. 12 The Young priest, he, to whom by choice The dame, whose charms in private bless'd That charmer of the public voice, The weakness of the flesh confess'd. Thus craftsmen and soldiers and clerics and laymen Do the burden pass, as they pass their way: And the burden is Divide impera! And the response to it is Ámen! Ámen! 13 Sic semper! Iron still is dasht On iron: blood on blood. The hours That rock the round world, rolling clasht From the high tops of temple towers, Are the hammers of Fate: and they fall and fall Heavy and fast on the anvil of Time; Where Humanity changes its shape as they chime, And, save only in shape, never changes at all. 14 'Twixt hammer, thus, and anvil bruised, The wretch upbraids that torturing two; And they reply, the oft accused, “There's one above us, deals the blow.” Who is it, then? History's intricate page Can but reckon the strokes, and record the gravamen. Stat pro ratione voluntas. Ámen. This is the song of the Iron Age. LVI. HOMO HOMINI LUPUS. 1 Some villagers who in their trap had caught An old sheep-stealing wicked Wolf at last, Resolved that he to trial should be brought, And judgment in due form upon him past. And since no Counsel could avail him aught, Because in fact his sentence was forecast, The Court, considering his case a grave one, Most graciously ordain'd that he should have one. 2 They might have hang'd or headed him at once Without this legal circumbendibus, Since he was in their power for the nonce. But Justice loves, as cats do with a mouse, Not to make all at once her final pounce Without some fond preliminary fuss Of indecision. So the Court decided A Counsel for the Wolf should be provided. 3 A man as full of learning as a book, A scientific traveller much respected By all the worthies of that rural nook Where he awhile was lodging, they elected To this good office: which he undertook Well pleased, since he for the accused detected Much to be urged. No harm the Wolf had done To flocks or herds of his. The man had none. 4 The Prosecutor's speech, as it behoved, Was most laconically eloquent. “For, since the Wolf's a wolf, my case is proved.” Said he, avoiding needless argument. Thro' no superfluous details he roved, But to the point with plain precision went, And cut his speech short, keeping to one head, The Wolf's; which must be cut off too, he said. 5 Upon the utterance of this demand The Culprit's learnèd Counsel show'd his teeth; The Wolf's teeth, not his own, you understand. And goodly teeth they were; above, beneath, Two rows of daggers formidably plann'd Their shining blades in flesh and blood to sheathe. “And you'll admit,” he said, “one fact is plain: Such tools were never made for grinding grain. 6 “But, as your shears for shearing wool were made, Which is the purpose that you put them to, So were the teeth set in this creature's head For tearing flesh; and he employs them so. What is there in such conduct to upbraid? The Wolf is innocent. He does but do As Nature bids him; whom obey he must. Then cut off Nature's head, if you'd be just. 7 “This beast, moreover, ('tis no merit small) Is one of the best parents in creation. I, therefore, for the Wolf's acquittal call, With damages to boot, and compensation From you his judges and accusers all, For false imprisonment and defamation.” The Judges and the Jurymen were, each And all, at first struck speechless by this speech. 8 But soon, with sense of scandalised propriety, They left the Wolf, his Counsel to assail; For language quite subversive of society, And doctrines which, if suffer'd to prevail, Would place all honest folks in great anxiety, Despite of gallows, constable, and jail. Science escaped, sore bruised, from this affray, And the sly Wolf, ill guarded, slipp'd away. 9 The Culprit and his Counsel being fled, No case remain'd before the Court. “I ween Never was such ill luck!” a Juror said. “That rogue, the Wolf, would certainly have been Condemn'd on every count, to lose his head, But for this most discreditable scene. For, what in our assemblies is so rare, This time we were unanimous, I'll swear.” 10 “Friend,” said another, “then you'll swear too much. Peter would still have voted against Paul: First, since by nature, or by habit, such His practice is; and next, since, after all, He knew his counter-vote could work no touch Of difference in the sentence, great or small. Some men there be who vote in opposition Always, with safety, upon this condition. 11 “The mischief is that, having now been told By that subversive scientific knave That he is in his natural rights, made bold Thereby, the Wolf is likely to behave With even greater licence than of old; And, fill'd with self-conceit, will fiercely crave The free indulgence of a natural right, To satisfy his wolfish appetite.” 12 “Nay, neighbours,” said a third, “you are, indeed, Too hard upon the Doctor. By the way, Who was it, Martin, cured thy cough unfee'd? Who mended Peter's pump? And who, Paul, say, Taught thee, by crossing, to improve that breed Whose fleeces fetch'd the highest price to-day? Ye took his counsel then, which now you spurn Because, forsooth, it serves another's turn. 13 “He said the Wolf was right to be a thief, And that is going far too far, say I. But then, he added that the Wolf's the chief Of all good fathers of a family; Which gives the lupine character relief. That touch'd me, and should touch us all. For why? These dangerous characters have still a heart; By which to win them is the statesman's art.” 14 So spake the Village Schoolmaster. He had A numerous family himself. In all Nine children, counting in the good and bad Together, and the big ones with the small. A fellow-father-feeling made him sad That even a rascal's family should fall Into starvation; and his eyes grew dim, For his own eloquence drew tears from him. 15 As for the Wolf, so far as can be guess'd, Nothing by all this praise and all this blame In him was alter'd. It must be confess'd A common error to think words make tame Or fierce such creatures. Wholly unimpress'd By all our talking, they remain the same. A wolf's a wolf: and nothing you can say Will change him, tooth or teat, say what you may. 16 Good talkers, flatter not the hungry crowd. All your soft words will butter it no bread. Yet speak the truth, nor spare to speak it loud For fear lest Hunger's clamour to be fed, Acknowledged just, should wax too fierce and proud. Words change not facts. Friends, cut off Hunger's head: There'll be no wolves to fear, or flatter, then. If not; beware of hungry wolves—and men! LVII. THE HORSE AND THE FLY. 1. A Horse-fly stung a Coach-horse in the nose. The Horse, with pain and terror of the bite, Rear'd, and (despite the Driver's cries and blows) Upset the coach; and gallop'd out of sight. 2. Side by side together, knitting Happy hand in hand, were sitting In the coach, when it roll'd over, Maiden-bride and Bridegroom-lover. By a pair More fond and fair Bridal vows were never spoken: And already rose in view The sweet home they were journeying to, When the Bridegroom's neck was broken, And the Bride's heart broken too. 3. The Coachman, from the coach-box thrown, Dash't out his brains on a boulder stone. The honest fellow behind him left A widow and orphans five bereft. 4. Fast and faster the Horse, poor brute, Flying in vain from the feign'd pursuit Of the goading pang his own flesh hath in it, And fiercely quickening at each wild minute The impetuous speed of his desperate paces; Whilst clamorous after him clatter the traces Which trail'd thro' a whirlwind of dust, he drags; (With flat ears back laid, and red nostril flay'd, And flanks foam-oozing, that heave and smoke) Gallops into the town, gallops over the flags, Where, to left and to right in precipitous flight, He scatters the startled and terrified folk. 5. After drifted blossoms straying, Birds and butterflies waylaying, Down the street a Child is playing: Springing, singing, for pure joy, All the world his pleasant toy; A fair, rosy, bright-hair'd boy. 6. And the people shout, and the people cry: And he hears the noise: but he knows not why The others are shouting, and he shouts too, For the joy of mere noise, as a child will do: And the galloping horse gallops over him. And that pretty Child (but a minute before, Life's merriest minim, all mirth and whim) Now a palpitant ruin bedabbled in gore, With bright head bleeding and broken limb, The people bear to his father's door. 7. That father's only child was he: Lost heir to a princely pedigree: Last fruit of an old ancestral tree. 8. Alas, what sufferings from a single cause! How many wrongs, how many miseries! What misdeeds punishable by no laws! Who was the guilty author of all these? The Horse? But what responsibility Have horses for their conduct, even when No horse-flies bite them? Not the Horse? The Fly? Well, but the Fly's misdeed? what was it, then? 9. Maternal love that Fly obey'd. Her eggs in Nature's lap she laid, And, moved by mother-instinct, tried For her own offspring to provide. 10. Maternal Love, then, must we call Sole author of these mischiefs all? If so (at least on moral ground Which some folks hold the only sound) Methinks 'tis easier (search and try them) To make laws than to justify them. LVIII. ET CÆTERA ET CÆTERA. 1 I saw a man die, miserably. Death With lips disdainful of such sorry fare (Like one who, sauntering thro' his orchard saith ‘The fruit, tho’ flyblown, that lies rotting there Must needs suffice me’) nibbled the remains Of life; which long disease, with parching breath Had ravaged so, that Death was doubtful where To bite what look'd no longer worth his pains. Naught of the wretch was left but sores and brains. 2 And nothing in this corpse-about-to-be Seem'd living yet but life's last beacons, two Bright feverish eyes, whence life defiantly So fierce was flashing, that Death, fain to know What meant their dumb defiance, render'd back A moment's breath to set the man's lips free; As hunters on a dying fire do blow For light to guide them on their dubious track, Ere they fare onward thro' the midnight black. 3 Then, to Death's question, the death-rattle cried “Long perishing I lived. On pain I fed. I had no children, and I had no bride, Like other men. But with Disease I wed, And this, mine own death-hour, on her begot. Yet all so well, against life's woes allied, My solitary soul, from heel to head, Was arm'd in patience, they subdued her not. What she hath wrought can neither rest nor rot. 4 “For in me a sublime idea hath lived; In me, and on me. What was I? Its food, And dwelling-house. I perish: but it thrived, And shall thrive. I have given it flesh and blood. That flesh and blood is mine. My whole life long Was for the good of this idea contrived, And all mine ills have but increased its good. Non omnis moriar! I still prolong My power in this, whose life mine own made strong. 5 “For there it lives—in yonder leaves—complete! Where yesterday these feverish fingers wrote The last word: not what crowns the closing sheet Of vulgar volumes with appropriate note: Not finis, my life's labour's last word was. Because I doubt not of my guerdon meet, Because the life, whereto did I devote Mine own life, here no mortal ending has, Therefore my last word is æternitas. 6 “Yes! mine idea shall live, bright, beauteous, glad. In me all's weak, but where is weakness here? In me all's sorrow, here is nothing sad. Clouded my life was, but my thought is clear. The Spirit that thro' formless space did flit, Seeking fit form, its budding purpose clad In a child's brain, and breath'd in that child's ear ‘Child, my thought chooseth for its servant fit, Live for it, labour, suffer, die for it!’ 7 “That child was I, and I obey'd. Alas, I lived to die. But, dying, I set free A life that's deathless. Into dust I pass Content, because the thought that lived in me Lives and shall live. 'Tis well. My work is done. Finis for me: for it æternitas!” That was the man's last word. His work and he Are both forgotten. Underneath the sun Naught is eternal save Oblivion. 8 I saw a chrysalis. It hung beneath My lattice eaves. I watch'd with hopeful eye The bright release of that embodied breath, The dead worm's destined beauteous butterfly. I tapp'd it, and there came a hollow sound. In Sleep's similitude, already Death Dreaming the birth of a new life did lie. I broke its shining shell. And there I found Another chrysalis within it bound, 9 But swollen big, and just about to burst; A second and surprising chrysalis, Whose growth had eaten hollow all the first, Which it would soon have shatter'd. What was this? The egg of an ichneumon: who, within The moth-grub's miserable frame, had nurst Her bastard babe, and fed on borrow'd bliss Its being, buried in her victim's skin Pierced, for that purpose, with a cloven pin. 10 The first eruca, thus, the second fed. Sic vos non vobis! The poor moth-grub pined. The young ichneumon in the moth-grub led A prosperous life. Upon the patron dined The client, well. The moth-grub labour'd sore, And starved. The ichneumon lack'd not board or bed. The second flourish'd as the first declined. The moth-grub died. The ichneumon lived the more, Wanton and wing'd, and livelier than before. 11 Doubtless that moth-grub knew not its own state: Felt deep disquiet, and divined not why: Was proud, perchance, that in it something great Grew, and grew greater. Was it haunted by Ambitious dreams? Meanwhile with toil intense It must have labour'd, to emancipate The life within it. Thus, its enemy, And idol also in a certain sense, The poor fool fatten'd at its own expense. 12 And did it, when it wove its death-shroud, say (Poor worm, that ne'er a butterfly might be, Whose past was pincht, whose future filch'd away By that which lived within it!) even as he Whom I saw dying, did it say, “I pass, My work remains. The Spirit I obey, As fittest out of thousands, fixt on me For that sublime idea whose slave I was. Finis for me: for it æternitas!” 13 Ah, ‘fittest out of thousands?’ Yet behold! The ichneumon which upon this worm did prey Will find just such another worm to fold The egg it is its wont in worms to lay. And from that egg will soar another fly, Which, in its turn, will do as did the old. And thus et cætera, et cætera, Et cætera, which, far as we can spy, Is also Latin for Eternity. 14 Patience hath of ichneumons pointed out As many as three hundred different kinds, All living on as many kinds, no doubt, Of different insects: as, on different minds, Different ideas. Brains, we must avow, The strongest, cannot yet per annum sprout Three hundred new ideas; and man finds The old ones troublesome. But troubles grow, And even the weakest brains breed notions now. 15 Meanwhile, whenever I behold a man With burthen'd forehead, bald before his time, And visage, like a lamp at noontide, wan, Who thinks, by nourishing some thought sublime, To pay himself, in death, life's many pains; And, having spent his strength in prose or rhyme On some idea which hath been the ban Of all his being, boasts “My work remains,” I muse “What maggot hath he in his brains?” LIX. MONUMENTUM ÆRE PERENNIUS. 1. Two neighbours from each other claim'd a field, And neither of the two his claim would yield. Wild words between them pass'd. These nothing skill'd. Blows follow'd words; and one of them was kill'd. The dead man's kinsfolk then together came, Sworn to do justice: and did just the same. That is to say, they did a second time What, done the first time, they had judged a crime, And slew the slayer. From these deaths arose 'Twixt tribe and tribe long strife of living foes; Who in the dead men's quarrel fought, until Which of the dead men did the other kill Was by their hostile progeny forgot; And neither side could quite remember what Each side was fighting for, tho' generations Prolong'd the conflict, and at last two nations In arms opposed each other. The sole aim And end of all such conflicts is the same, Whether two peasants or two peoples fight: Each from the other strives to wrest the right; Each on the other strives to wreak the wrong; And each, as both the varying strife prolong, Is vanquisht or is victor, turn about. For, as “the whirligig of time” whirls out Alternate chances, is the vanquisht race Avenged on the victorious. In this case, Born of the conquer'd tribe, arose (men say) After long centuries had roll'd away, A conqueror: who, in half a hundred fights, The wrongs of his slain fathers to the rights Of their more fortunate sons converted; slew, And led to slaughter, thousands; but o'erthrew The overthrower, and to dust beat down A secular oppression. Tower and town Tumbled in smoky ashes, heaps of bones Pasht and in a bloody puddle, gasps and groans Of masht-up men, a mass of different deaths Mixt with a murmur of admiring breaths, Founded the first eternal monument Which in men's memories made this last event Imperishable; and, with gush of gore And glory from men's minds for evermore Wiped out the first, poor, perishable, mean Cause of the conflict, which thereby had been Crown'd with immortal claim upon the praise And retrospective pride of after days. 2. To many a lyre by many a lyrist strung, About the land that hero's deeds were sung. And many a homely lay, from door to door, From sire to son, repeated o'er and o'er, Transmitted to a far posterity Traditions of his worth. But, rolling by, Time, in its unretentive current, brought New interests, new desires, to thrust from thought The rusted image of the Heroic Age; Whereof this monument remain'd to wage War with Oblivion. Vainly; till, by chance, Its mouldering record caught the fervid glance Of one who, haunted by a name forgot, Raked in old legends long remember'd not For glimpses of that name; which, like a star Flashing mysterious splendour from afar, Brighten'd the abysmal past. Its fading beams This poet mingled with his own fresh dreams, And wrought therefrom, to renovate renown, A poem which the whole world for its own Claim'd and forthwith immortalised. Thereof (As, from the music of Amphion, rough With topless towers, arose in circuit strong The Theban ramparts raised by rolling song) A new eternal monument was made: Whose glory cast into oblivious shade (Or in its brighter self absorb'd anon) The lesser lustres of the former one. For, from this fresh eternal monument Gracing the threshold of an age, were sent Memnonian melodies and echoes far, Waked by the radiance of the rising star Of a new art more beautiful than war. 3. The old eternal monument, meanwhile, Whereof naught rested but a ruin'd pile Of names and dates (mere useless rubbish reckon'd) Had furnish'd forth foundations for the second. 4. And all men deem'd the Poet's work to be More lasting than the Hero's. Nathless, he Who wrote the poem which, by men proclaim'd Immortal, made its mortal parent famed, Had died of want in some obscure small town. Men search'd, in vain, the empire up and down To find his birthplace; and, not finding it, (Tho' many volumes were to help them writ, Each volume proving hopelessly absurd Whatever by the others was averr'd) The baffled seekers by degrees began To shape the ideal image of the man Out of his song; imagining a face And figure suited to his spirit's grace. The State, then, order'd that this image, cast In ever-during bronze, should be at last Erected in the imperial capital On a tall pillar; to be seen of all Who there, throughout the ages, came and went. 5. This was the third eternal monument; Which all the previous monuments effaced. And the great poet's name, upon it traced, Was read by multitudes who read no more The old-fashion'd verses whence that name of yore Its immortality of fame received; Which from Oblivion nothing new retrieved Save the bronze image, on whose marble base His name still figured, in the market place. 6. Long while this third eternal monument Struggled with time, and the wild weathers bent On its destruction. But it felt their strength; And, bit by bit, the rain and rust at length Wore out the graven words and sculptured frieze. The image, also, dwindled by degrees. One day the lightning struck it, and it fell. At least, so saith the civic chronicle Which is our warrant (since we cannot show Proof more conclusive) for believing now That such a statue once commemorated The birth (by modern critics much debated) Of such a poet. Nowadays you see A brave soap-boiling manufactory Upon the spot where once that statue stood, Which made immortal, for the multitude That moved beneath it in the days gone by, The poet's unremember'd memory; Who sung the imperishable song; that wrought Renew'd eternity in human thought For that immortal hero's deathless name; Whose perisht immortality of fame Rose from the reek of bloody towns ablaze, Even as the smoke that rises nowadays From yon tall chimney; which yet marks the spot Where stood the statue men remember not. 7. These facts we have thought fitting to consign In the foregoing record, line by line, To the attention of posterity; In order that we haply might thereby Save all these otherwise entirely lost Eternities; which mutually cost Each other's ultimate annihilation. Nothing remains of them, but this narration. 8. And, if this last must be forgotten too (Leaving no vestige to the future) who Will owe its author (the fourth time, alas!) ‘A monument more durable than brass?’ LX. SANS SOUCI. PROLOGUE Work! But when can I work, pray, when? At morn? I have not yet done my doze. At noon? But too heavy the heat is then. At eve? But eve is the time for repose. At night? But at night I'm asleep again. Work? What is it? As I suppose, 'Tis the vain invention of idle men; Whom the Devil could help to no happier plan For getting thro' time, than this idiot trick Of adding fatigue to fatigue; like a man Who carries his boots at the end of a stick Slung behind him, to add to the heat And the weight on his back; as, with limping feet, Thro' the flints that tear, and the thorns that prick, He fares barefooted, and boasts he can With such bootless trouble get on so quick. If you chanced, as you wander'd, to meet with a brook Flowing among the mountains, say Would you hasten back to the house, and look For a bucket to fetch the water away Into the valley? Down from the hills Let the water flow as the water wills. When it gets to the valley at last, some day, There will it stay, unashamed? or say “To work! to work!” and begin with pain To run up the hills and back again? Enough is doing around it. Why Should itself be doing aught? The sun Reveals to it all that, up in the sky, The weather is going to do, or hath done. The moon will bathe in it by and by; And the stars, that follow her one by one, Seek and discover it, Peeping thro' Clouds that flow over it, Changed in hue By winds that o'erhover it, Hid in the blue. Barks, too, along it From shore to shore Will wander, and throng it With sail and oar. Each bending double, With sweat o' the brow From toil and trouble, The rowers row, But, how fast soever their oars may fall The water, which takes no trouble at all, Will still be the first to leap to shore. And, what is more, when the voyage is o'er, Will still be as fresh as it was before. Lie on the bank, then! idly lie Beside me, watching the wave flow by. And, if Fancy follow it, heed not why. Heed not why, and heed not where. Fancy will find in the summer air Whatever she seeks, for her home is there. Let us open our hearts to the summer sky. From mine I have let this fable fly. Who knows where it may 'light? Not I. PART I. There were two brothers. And each of the two Said to the father of both “Let us go Forth and away, O Father, from thee. For the world is fair: and eager are we To be living there, with a life set free.” And the Father said to his sons “Do so.” But, first (for a mighty magician was he) “My sons,” he said, “the world is wide; What in it attracts you most, decide. And then ask (ye shall get it) the gift of me Which best for the choice of you each may be.” And “O Lord our Father,” the sons replied, “Even so! and to each, as the choice, be the dower.” Then he carried them up where, in all its pride, From the summit serene of a specular tower Might be descried upon every side The whole round world. And, opening at once The magazines of his manifold power, He said to them “Chuse, and use, my sons.” The First made choice of a pair of legs. Stout flesh and blood, no wooden pegs; But legs of muscle and sinew strong, That could do whatever a man's legs can. “And with these,” quoth he, “will I get along,” As he put them on and became a Man. The Second laid hold on a sturdy root, Pleased with its power of fixing fast; Hid himself with it; and, shoot by shoot, Became, tho' slowly, a Tree at last. The man in possession of that stout pair Of human legs, by the help of these Trod many a road, scaled many a stair, Climb'd the mountains, traversed the seas, Braved strange weathers, and breathed strange air, Learn'd new manners, new languages, Saw crowded cities, and deserts bare, Felt the dogstar burn, and the polestar freeze, Ransack'd earth for the far, the fair, And yet nowhere on earth could the man find ease. For, wherever he thought to have settled, there Something he noticed which fail'd to please, Or something he miss'd which had pleased elsewhere. And the worse he fared the further he went, For comparison everywhere ruin'd content. Those legs ran away with him: day by day Wearing his life out; and wearing away His boots; which to mend, he was forced to spend, And, in order to spend, was forced to get, And, in order to get, to earn by the sweat Of his brow, the gold which in getting and spending The man wax'd old; still wearily wending That way thro' the world whereunto is no ending. PART II. Long tired of that long way, he sank at last Worn out upon the wayside sod, beneath A mighty tree; whose branches o'er him cast Shade that was shelter, haunted by the breath Of hidden flowers. A rivulet flow'd past From out-of-sight to out-of-sight; and, flowing, Call'd out calm sadness from the silence vast Wherein hot noon was glowing. Then did that old man feel thro' all his frame A creeping rest. His legs, whose strength was spent, Left him at last in peace; and he became Careless and conscious of a vague content. But, while he follow'd with incurious gazes The streamlet flowing where aught pleased it best, That melancholy, which in man's soul raises Emotion born of rest, Drew from the old man's eyes another stream (Whose source was in his spirit) of sad tears. And, as some spot which only in a dream A man remembers, who forgets the years That made it long forgotten, so to him Return'd a memory of that mystic minute When life's choice lay before him, with a dim Desire of action in it. “Alas!” he wept, “what wasted tears Are these which weep my wasteful years! And all this while, what have I done But still from disappointment run To disappointment? With what pain What mountains have I climb'd in vain! What flesh and blood these feet have left On flinty peak, in thorny cleft! How many a time these knees and shins Have suffer'd for their owner's sins! How often, falling bruised and sore, With rage have I arisen once more, To stumble on, I know not where And know not how—such vagrants were These worn-out legs! What have I gain'd, Who, leaving all, have naught attain'd, And naught have kept? I wonder how It fares with my lost brother now.” PART III. Then sound that, flowing, follow'd sound Rippled the leaves above him. And the branches, bending down to the ground, A canopied cradle wove him. As still as a tired child that is taking Sweet rest on its mother's knee, The grey old man, neither sleeping nor waking, Lay under the green old tree. And was it brother speaking to brother? For he heard the tender tone Of a voice that seem'd not the voice of another, Though he knew that it was not his own. It was sweeter than all other voices are. It was not like the voice of a man. It seem'd so near, and yet seem'd so far, And it spake as no other voice can. PART IV. Softly it murmur'd “Dost thou know me not, My brother? I, the Forest, I am he, The one friend left thee in earth's one safe spot, Whose love, where'er thou wanderest, waits for thee; “Outlasting all things for the loss of which That love is consolation: gold misspent, Youth wasted, hope impoverisht, to make rich The thankless avarice of discontent. “Love faithful, love unchangeable, and fast As is the root whereby 'tis fixt and fed! Vainly the world, wherein no root thou hast, Thou wanderest seeking what, when found, is fled. “And think'st thou I am solitary? Thou It is who art a wandering solitude. For from thy life away thy life doth flow, And, self-pursuing, thou art self-pursued. “‘Not here,’ thou sigh'st, ‘I live, for life is there.’ Yet, hadst thou waited, life had come to thee, Who, seeking life, hast miss'd it everywhere; Whilst here, where rest is mine, life sends to me “Momently messengers, that know the way To find me, from the world's four corners come. The winds, and clouds, and stars of heaven, are they, And the sweet birds that to my heart fly home. “Count me the emmets that go up and down My creviced bark. Know'st thou what myriads move In any blade of grass o'er which is thrown The shadow of my power and of my love? “What lurks and crouches under any stone That nestles at my feet? What builds and breeds In my least berry? Or what deeds are done Even by my least distinguishable seeds? “The Tree stands steadfast, contemplating all. Tree-trunk from tree-trunk earth holds safe and single: But, weaving one etherial coronal, Tree-top, in heaven, doth with tree-top mingle. “What buoyant bridges, which the squirrel knows, How airy light, how delicately wrought, The elm-tree to his beechen brethren throws, Where branch with branch is mixt, as thought with thought! “All this the Tree hath of the root he hath. For whoso hath no root, no life hath he. No path leads to him. And by every path He from himself must needs a wanderer be.” PART V. Whilst thus the mystic voice yet spoke, Harsher sounds thro' the forest broke. And men came thro' it, and men came near, With shoulder'd axe. “What do ye here Intruders?”—“Ho! we hew down wood. Idler, make way for Work!” They stood Under the tree; and the axe was laid To the root thereof; and the tall tree sway'd To and fro, and then crash'd to the ground. The old man, stunn'd (but not by the sound) About him gazed with bewilder'd eye Over the alter'd earth and sky, And “What is it,” he moan'd, “that is broken in me?” As he follow'd his brother, the fallen tree. Follow'd the tree to the timber-yard: Learn'd the craft of the carpenter: Plied hammer and saw, and labour'd hard, Laid plank upon plank, join'd oak to fir, Till the stately vessel slid from the slips, Slid from the land, and slid into the sea. There, with those new-gotten wings of hers, To wander the waters—a ship among ships, Who no longer a tree among trees might be, And (a mariner, there, among mariners) With the rest of the good ship's crew went he, The man, not able to leave the tree. PART VI. On the sideless seas, in the middle hour Of the savage and measureless night; when stars By curdling clouds were quench'd, and a shower Of stormy sleet thro' shrouds and spars Shriek'd; and the grieved ship seem'd to cower Under night's weight, as wild she ran Across the cruel grey waves; the man Lean'd his ear to the tree (which fast Stood over him still, a mighty mast) For the wood, with an inward moan, began To writhe and heave: till there came at last A thunderous buffet of wave and wind That shatter'd the ship. And, swept by the blast Into the murtherous midnight, blind With madden'd weather, clinging together, O'er the headlong sea the man and the tree Drifted to shore on a desert isle. The ship and the crew had perisht meanwhile. But the man was alive: and the tree (twice dead) Which had saved him, still protected him. For of part thereof, to shelter his head, A roof he wrought; and each dripping limb He dried and warm'd at the fire he made Of the rest of the wood. And when morning rose Over the reefs, with ravage spread, As tho' on a world all newly made, And smiling, safe from its last birth-throes, In freshness, sweetness, light, and repose, The man, left lone in the desert, said “Oh what a release! to be left in peace By all that trouble of tiller and tackle, The captain's cries, and the shipmen's cackle! Each rope and sail, and yard and shroud, That, in calm or gale, no quiet allow'd, But must ever be shifted that way and this For fear of shipwreck; which, all the same, In spite of our trouble and caution came. And oh how delicious the freedom is From all care henceforth of the cargo that's gone, Or the ship, that is sunk, or the voyage, that's done!” PART VII. Years, long afterwards, mariners, driven By stress of weather, touch'd on that isle, Where their ship had found a natural haven Hidden from howling storms. And while The desert, in search of springs, they roved, In the desert they found a fallen pile Of spars and planks; whose structure proved That a human hand had fashion'd and hewn That pile, long since by the sea-winds strewn. And, under the ruins which once were a hut (Safe from the ruining sea-winds shut) A dead man lay. And the dead man's face Yet wore, in its features worn, that trace Which a life in the waste cannot all efface Of a life once lived in busier lands. The mariners buried with pious hands That dead man's dust in the desert sands. And, since they found two spars of a tree Which none of the island trees could be (Parts they seem'd of a broken mast, Haply to shore with the dead man cast) They set them, crosswise, above the grave Of their fellow-creature; in sign of the faith Which, finding but death in life, men have That man's spirit is made for a life in death. It was the last protection that the tree Could give the man, his brother. And ah, if helpless that protection be, What help in any other? END OF THE SECOND VOLUME</field>
