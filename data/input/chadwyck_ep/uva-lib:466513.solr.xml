      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I., VOL. II., VOL. III. Dedicatory sonnets from the beginning of VOLS. II and III have been included at the beginning of VOL. I. DEDICATION. TO HER MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY THE QUEEN. SONNET DEDICATORY. TO THE QUEEN. The light of Heaven seems shed in richer stream, The sky-born breeze more fresh and odorous roves, Where the fair Majesty of England moves!— It seemeth like some strange, uncertain dream!— Is that bright Maiden, in whose blue eyes beam Such depths of sweetness—Her, whom Heaven approves, And men acknowledge with true loyal loves, Crowned chief of Earth's chief Empire!—first!—supreme? Hark!—many a shout exultant thrills the air, Thundering through temples, towers, and trophied piles!— The whirlwind-voice of thousands!—hailing there The Imperial Daughter of the Imperial Isles!— Acclaim and blessings the oercharged echoes bear Where the sweet Majesty of England smiles! SONNET DEDICATORY. TO THE QUEEN. It is a touching, gracious sight to see, Daughter of Empire!—great and glorious Queen!— Thy maidenly and yet majestic mien, In thy young stateliness of Royalty;— Daughter of Empire!—thou!—thus born to be The light and glory of this earthly scene,— Move on in triumph calm and state serene, Bless'd by the good, the gallant, and the free!— Child of an hundred Kings!—the fair—the crowned— Lady of many Nations!—loved of all!— How gladly swell the echoed shouts around; Fettering the free air in their thundering thrall— Rising from every heart's deep core profound— Blessings on Her—the Sovereign Maid to call! SKETCHES AND SHADOWINGS. THE LIGHTNINGS. The Lightnings!—Oh! the Lightnings!— A thousand Heavens they make— They break up with their brightenings Th'arched Heavens that heave and quake. Th' arched Heavens that blaze around, By their burning shares up ploughed— Where before deep shadows frowned, And the darkness of the cloud! Are they come to show us now Those Worlds in Beauty bright, Which the Sun may ne'er allow To shine forth beside his light! Are they come indeed to show Those fair Worlds in their own forms, Which we faintly trace below— These the winged Suns of the Storms? Worlds, which Darkness doth invest With too much of troubling Light, When they sparkle on the breast Of the purple shadowy Night. Since too strongly still relieved, 'Mid those mighty depths of gloom, Thence keen powers have they received— Thence strange splendours they assume. A confusion of quick rays Then the unsteady sight doth storm, In the beauty and the blaze— Seems thus lost the frame and form. Nor thou, Sun!—nor thou, Oh! Night! May those glorious worlds reveal!— Or not at all—or not aright— Ye confuse them or conceal! Oh! bright orbs—immortal shrines, Shall ye ne'er be clearly shown? Whether sinks the Sun or shines, Lost in his Light—or your own! But the Lightnings—but the Lightnings, With their pale and mystic glow, With their sudden-kindling brightenings May they serve to illume and show? With their quick uncertain gleam, Wild and spiritual and strange, Like the light we see in dream, That doth ever fleet and change. With their phantom splendours pale— Not intense like Sunshine's blaze— May they gloriously avail To display these to our gaze! No!—since though they seem from far, 'Tis too near they take their birth— When compared with severed Star— They might well seem born of Earth! They may serve not thus to bare Those dread mysteries—proudly wrought— Ye flash only brightening there, Lightnings born of deathless Thought! Ye can only, strong in sway, These reveal—still faintly shown, Since 'midst all that ye display, How much more remains unknown! Lightning-Lights of sceptred Thought, Ye can only there prevail! Yet—though oft with triumphs fraught, Must ye not far oftener fail? Oh! Creation widening grows Round your path the more ye soar— Every step ye take but shows A bright Universe the more! When the highest of the heights Appeareth to be won, Thickening crowd those Sovereign Lights, Till Space blazes to a Sun! And the Lightnings—Lo! the Lightnings Though a thousand Heavens they form, They can fling not their faint brightenings O'er those Suns that 'midst them swarm! Worlds above!—these surely fail To make your dread wonders known, But they beamingly unveil Many wonders of our own! Oh! all marvellous are they, Those mysterious laws profound, Which with certain influence sway The ambient atmosphere around. Lo! all the elements confess One o'erruling guiding Hand, Which doth still on each impress The awful signs of its command. And the rushing winds and rains Know their part, their place, their path, They are bound by viewless chains— Each its fixed commission hath! And the Lightnings wild and free, Know their lesson and their law— They too, still obedient—flee— As with curb of conscious awe! Through their dazzling devious way— When they leave their cloud-girt nest, Well they know and well obey One irresistible behest! Every wild uncertain gleam Of their wild uncertain light— Keen forked tongue and sheeted stream Are controulled by guiding might! And the Lightnings as they range, And the Thunders as they roll, Still confess, through every change, The Incomprehensible Controul! Lo! the Lightnings!—Lo! the Lightnings!— Ten thousand Heavens they form, With Division's troublous heigthenings In the footsteps of the storm! The great Firmament was one!— Then all multiplied it spreads— Lit by that wild Lightning-Sun Which a Spirit-splendour sheds! The great Firmaments become Then a myriad and yet more— Dome seems built up beyond dome— Floor seems stretched out after floor! 'Tis a glorious, glorious scene, Yet a fearful, and a dread, Bright Heavens—dark Heavens between, Spreads the riven vault overhead! Lo! the Lightnings take the place Of the immortal Worlds of Light— And they fill the unbounded space, And they fire the o'ershadowing Night! They light not the eternal Stars, But eclipse them with their blaze, While the storm's cloud-bannered wars Shake the Earth with sore amaze! Brief is still their race and reign, But while last that reign—that race— How they blaze out chain by chain— How they live from space to space! How they look out from what seems The great Sun's dim empty throne! As they ev'n eclipsed his beams With the wild glare of their own! Nature—Mighty Nature starts At that strange and sudden glare, As they pierced her heart of hearts, Through the Earth, and through the Air! And the Lightnings—Oh! the Lightnings! Ten thousand Heavens they frame— Through their hurrying restless heightenings— With their glorious wands of flame! THE VOW. I met thy careless, thy contemptuous glance, Oh! thou that could'st my yielding Soul entrance, And inwardly resolved I, proudly then, To pay thee back thy scorn with scorn again. What! shalt thou e'er despise me or deride? No! I will fling thee back still Pride for Pride! 'Twas thus, at that dark moment that I vowed Ne'er to be crushed by love—by feeling bowed! A thousand firm resolves I strongly formed, My breast with fiery indignation warmed, I hurled my heartless Idol from my Soul, And bade revenge—revenge possess the whole. I turned from thee away, and checked a tear, And wreathed love's withering smile into a sneer— I trembling turned—and threatened as I turned Love's very ghost should be for aye inurned! That it should never haunt mine altered heart, Nor take a dear deceiver's treacherous part— I challenged Memory, and I championed Fate, And felt my strengthened Soul itself create! So proudly feels the unchained th' uplifted mind, A nobler nature with its nature twined, When Thought on wings of loftier ardour flies, And Hope quits Earth to quicken in the Skies! So brightly feels the heart at length set free, That long endured a prisoned slave to be, A lovelier life with its own life blent then, To Hope—to Freedom we are born again! Aye! then the strengthened Soul—armed, roused, elate, Appears itself rejoicing to create— It spreads its plumes—it casts away its chains— It lives in liberty—in rapture reigns. And these my feelings were—my thoughts were these, An Empire's strong command 'twas mine to seize, The Empire of myself—and then indeed, Exulted I, from galling fetters freed! I joyed to find and feel my spirit's strength, I laughed at tyrant love and thee at length, I gloried in mine independence new, And pitied hearts too tender and too true. I turned away—yet once again I turned To look my last on one I scorned and spurned, A drooping form I saw, and downcast face, All mournful with repentance' pallid grace. Methought I heard a sigh—a long-drawn sigh— Methought I saw a tear in that lowered eye, I leant towards that bowed form—so pale and chill— Leaned—listened—lingered—looked—and—loved thee still! SONG OF THE DYING IMPROVISATRICE. Come!—Beatific Breathings!—come, And call my sinking spirit home, And bless once more my kindling heart With Hope—and so let it depart In Inspiration's flash and light— Bearing that with it through Death's Night! Aye!—Inspiration's sunny wave Shall break in beauty o'er the grave!— That Fountain of Heaven's Fire shall throw O'er Death itself a dream-born glow, And dazzle from its mien the gloom Which makes the heart shrink from the tomb! Come, glorious Inspiration! come, And wafted to its Heavenly Home By thee, my Soul shall gladly spring Upon a strong and fearless wing— Yet, Oh! from Heaven and not from Earth Must thou flash brightening into birth! But, on this mixed and mystic scene, What hath for ever deeply been Mine Inspiration's spring and source— Its truth—its strength—its depth—and force, Oh! what but Love—the etherial Power, Life's precious though its poisoned flower. And, Oh! my Soul, let Love be still The awakener of each quickening thrill; Let Love still, still with wond'rous might Wing every thought to some far flight, And wake my mind's declining powers Even in these dark and darkening hours. But Love, not such as e'er before Throbbed in this bosom's burning core, A nobler feeling and a higher, Than that which once had power to inspire, More precious too a thousand fold, And, Oh!—not poisoned as of old! Love—with all higher dreams of Truth, (Diviner scarce can be—in sooth!) Brightly and exquisitely blent To raise the drooping Soul, long bent Beneath his Earthly rule in fear, For Love! thou'rt but a trembler here! With things that fade and fall no more Commingling as thou didst before, No more with things that droop and die, Joined tenderly, but mournfully— The dews of morn—the Summer's rose— That soon sinks blighted where it blows! No!—New associations bright Shall bless thee in thy new delight, The everlasting Stars shall blaze Thy name in wreaths of deathless rays! The fountains of the immortal streams Reflect thy Beauty as it beams. Love!—come unto my spirit now, In thine exalted guise—Oh! thou That long hast o'er that spirit reigned, That long hast ruled it and enchained; Come! and thy loftier sway extend Now, o'er its quick dreams—without end. And shall it not sublimely seem In that august and rapturous dream, (Above all joy that ever blessed The happiest and most cloudless breast!) As though half-way Heaven met the Soul— Winged to its high Cœlestial goal! Since thou! Love! raised and purified— Nor more with dreams of Earth allied— No more with mortal burthens bowed, But lifted from thy clayey shroud, A Heaven thyself indeed must be Of yet untried Felicity! And, Oh! in this o'ershadowed hour Possess my Soul with all thy power, With all thy truth of deep delight— And Death shall melt before thy might Unto a pleasant sleep—a rest On thy immortal Angel-breast! I go—but my now strengthened heart No more refuseth to depart! With sick reluctance—dim distrust— Still shrinking from the cold dark dust!— Still clinging to this Earth's vain things, Which clogged its faintly-fluttering wings. I go—but those fond struggles cease— That tore my heart—now lulled to peace— Thy beauty, Earth! is still the same, But glimpsed in Lightning-dreams of flame Now, Worlds of mightier beauty blaze, And win my wonder-smitten gaze. Worlds of immortal Beauty shine— And draw me from all charms of thine— Which once enraptured and inspired The Soul—that admiration fired Too wildly—'mid Life's doubts and woes, Or for its weal—or its repose! Come! Beatific Breathings!—come, And call my longing Spirit home— And soothe all faultering fears away— And reconcile me to decay! Since that the harbinger must be Of Life and Immortality! Oh! in my proudest, happiest strain, Still moaned the stifled sigh of pain— O'er my most fair and radiant dream The shadow crept—and Joy did seem Too near to Sorrow evermore— On this o'erclouded Earthly shore! But never crossed by sigh of pain Shall be my Soul's new glorious strain— Never by shadow clouded o'er, As were my loveliest dreams of yore, Shall be the Immortal dreams of light Which yet shall glad my wond'ring sight. Farewell! ye fading flowers of Earth! That change and perish from your birth— No more shall ye surround my lyre— No! wreaths of living light and fire Shall crown its chords of rapture now— And circle too my cloudless brow! Hopes, loves, and joys of Earth, farewell!— More than this trembling lip can tell, Ye once reigned wholly in my heart, As though ye could not thence depart! But ye make place in your decline For hopes and joys and loves divine! Come! Beatific Breathings! come, And call my yearning Spirit home! Earth's beauty seems but ashes now, Fame's trophies fade along my brow, And Thought by Thought I would depart, While Death's cold hand weighs on my heart! DEATH'S SOVEREIGNTY. Thou art the Mighty One!—All bend to thee— The proudest with profound humility— The strongest with an abject weakness, fain To bend beneath thy crushing yoke and chain! The wisest with a consciousness complete, Of utter failure, and entire defeat. Thou art the Mighty One—all bend to thee, And all thy vassals and thy slaves must be, Thy triumph hath no limit and no end— And all that ghastly triumph must attend, Chained to thy chariot-wheels or soon or late, To swell the pomp of thy too fearful state, To lengthen out that long and gloomy train, Which ceaseth not to pass o'er Earth's broad plain, That sad procession for which Earth doth pave Her paths with flowers—they lead but to the grave, And all in that procession join at last, The dense—the unimaginably vast. Thou art the Mighty One—thy rule extends Unto the conquered World's last, farthest ends, All things created, still appear to be Created—Oh! thou Sovereign Death! for thee. Each cherub child just smiling at the Sun, Whose little life in bliss is then begun, Is a new subject, born to endure thy sway, And homage at thy shadowy throne to pay; Yon lovely Bride may clasp her Bridegroom's hand, But thou shalt chain her with a stronger band— To thy cold heart thou 'lt clasp that radiant form, Now full of life and beauty, fresh and warm; Yon youthful labourer in the fields of Fame, Thine icy wand shall yet subdue and tame; And yon vain worldling, to the Future blind, Each onward step he takes leaves life behind. Death—Death—that shadowy word doth cover all, And the whole World's an echo to thy call! Oh! thou, the Phantom-Suzerain of the Earth, For whom alone all objects spring to birth! Proud World of Life—one Death indeed thou art, And still the sentence is—to pass, to part— To leave all things beloved, all well known things, To which too soon, too much the fond heart clings, To join that dread procession's long-drawn gloom, Which moveth ever—ever—to the Tomb! A mighty and innumerable train, Thousands and tens of thousands—and again Yet tens of thousand thousands—without end, While all or soon or late, still all attend Thy more than Conqueror's triumph! How dost thou Wear all Earth's crowns to light thy dusky brow, Plucked from the proud Monarchic brows that bore Their jewelled circles loftily before, All treasures that the mightiest have amassed, Have at thy feet been with reluctance cast— All trophies that the noblest hath acquired, Have been given up to thee, though undesired, For the whole World is thy dread trophy still, And all it hath but waits upon thy will! Thou Phantom-Suzerain of Creation!—Where Dost thou consent to pause, or deign to spare? We walk but in thy footsteps evermore, For thine Earth's empire is from shore to shore! SONG. [Long have I mourned, and long have known] Long have I mourned, and long have known To breathe faint Sorrow's plaintive moan— But yet, fair Hope! thy smile would come To make a Sunshine of the gloom! The present might oppress my heart— But since, still hovering near thou wert, I little feared the future day, But thought to shun Grief's tyrant sway! But 'tis a bitter grief, when thou Veilest thy Seraph-seeming brow, When terror plants its icy fangs In hearts that know a thousand pangs! When frowns the Future yet more dark, Before our billow-beaten bark, Than even the Present in its gloom, And Hope lies hid behind—the tomb! When all that Future is a fear, When shrinking, trembling, shivering here, We yet with sick and chill dismay Look to the Grave's appointed day. Oh! Hope! fair Hope! thou comest not now With budding roses round thy brow, With charmed cup within thine hands, Sprinkling Life's dull and desert sands! Hope! thou dost treacherously desert This sad and overburthened heart, And leavest it to cruel pain, Nor whisperest—“I will come again!” Thou leav'st it to thy sister—Fear, And lorn it is, and faint and drear, And Grief's dark shadow girds it round, Its grave is ev'n already found! Heart! thou hast already found thy grave, And what can heal—and what can save? No earthly power—no earthly aid— Earth hath abandoned and betrayed! Long have I mourned—and long have wept— And many a heavy vigil kept; But ne'er till now was I deprived Of Hope—on whose sweet smiles I lived! Oh! worse than weary is the woe, When nought is left to hope below— When nought remains but vain regret, That pineth for the Sun that's set! Each gloomy moment seems to bring An added thorn—another sting— While none the needful balm supply, Nor make a new expectancy! But this variety of ills My Soul with vague despondence fills, And thus distracts it from the one By which 'twas first—and most undone! If I must mourn then, let me be Perplexed by Grief's variety— By many pierced—we strive 'gainst none— Resist—and wrestle with the One! MEMORY'S MAGIC. Oh! Memory! thou canst give us back again Our own old feelings, yet unwrung with pain, Our peace, our purity—till Sin appears Though the long growth perchance of evil years, By thee so sweetly sinned against—'tis lost, Like shadows by strong gleams of Sunshine crost! Sin seems to whiten back to Innocence, Cleansed of its stains—and of its dim clouds dense, All brightly cleared, and lightened for awhile, Even by the sacred Magic of thy smile! Aye, Sin, unsinned, that long hath had abode Within the heart by thoughts infirm o'erflowed, Forgets its evil into good, when thus Keen stricken by thy wand so luminous, Thou mighty and thou all-resistless Power, That makest the Soul thine own for thy brief hour, And dost improve and change it as thou wilt, Till Good becomes its gracelessness and guilt! Oh! who can vividly and well recall His childhood's days, ere bound by basest thrall Of selfishness and passion, he forgot All lovely, lofty duties of his lot, Without a momentary change of state, A temporary rising o'er his fate! And o'er his feelings, darkened and debased By long continuance of a trust misplaced In all the hollow nothings of this Earth, Of frailest tenure, and of poorest worth? Till yet once more, ev'n as a little child, With lowly simple nature undefiled, The World's fond victim half regenerate moves, And humbly trusts—and reverently loves— And deeply feels—from guilt and from its guile, Through thy dear charm, delivered for awhile, Strong Memory! thou canst teach the Soul once more To be the stainless thing it seemed before, Restore the harmonious truth, that round it hung, Of yore, recalling from what source it sprung— Give back that glorious light it seemed to bring Even from that source—Life's high and holy spring! And make it feel as it were newly born— The spark fresh kindled with the fires of morn! Thou canst do thus—but, Ah! in vain—in vain— If sinks the Soul from that fine height again, If back it falls into the common dust, And woos its earthly idols to its trust— Memory, how vain is then thy brief bright sway, What empty homage unto thee we pay, We but remember all that once we were, To grovel back into our sordid care— To hug again a half forgotten load Of vile anxieties, on Life's steep road! And to renounce the promise and the hope, Content along our twilight path to grope, Without the only aid that can sustain And bless our weak endeavours, else how vain!— The aid Divine, the which indeed to acquire, We must controul each World-defiled desire, And be as little children pure and meek, And humbly strive, and innocently seek. Oh! Memory! snatch my spirit back once more To all its blameless thoughts and dreams of yore, And bid my present consciousness to cease A little while, that I may dwell in peace Beneath the shadow of thy quiet wings, And save me from all vain and dangerous things, Which gain too much ascendancy and power O'er the unsuspicious Soul, hour after hour. Oh! let me be beneath thine influence mild, Once more, once more, as ev'n a little child, And in that humble holy mood serene, Let me continue through Life's changeful scene, And fixedly and faithfully remain, Even when released from thy engirdling chain; Set free from thy enchanted flowery yoke, Whose gentle clasp so many fetters broke, So many burdens tenderly removed, And such a high and Heavenly blessing proved! Yes! Memory, when beneath thy soft controul, Once more the dreamer grows a child in Soul, 'Tis thine to make him, for a little space, Raised o'er the crimes and follies of his race, One of that glorious Kingdom, all sublime, Beyond the petty march of measured time, That glorious Kingdom, where the dwellers be As little children in their purity! Who from that Heavenly kingdom would descend, With Earth's vile nothings yet again to blend? And stained with sin and sorrow to pass on, 'Mongst sufferers and 'midst sinners—surely none! Memory, ev'n now thy power o'er me exert, Bring childhood's trustful feelings to my heart, Bring me mine own old feelings once again, Unchilled by doubt and all unwrung by pain; And more—far more—by evil unalloyed, With purity unaltered—undestroyed! Memory, ev'n now thy power o'er me assert, And bring back childhood to my Soul and Heart! TIME. Time! oft when I have heard some solemn clock Startle the air with its sonorous shock, While rung with chime, prolonged upon the ear, The strong vibration of its echoes clear, I have translated thus thy stern address, To those that mark thee little—prize thee less— “Haste! Mortals, haste!—improve the gift of birth, Ye have a God in Heaven—a Grave on Earth!” For it is so! and soon, how soon we crave Below, the shelter of that shadowing Grave, How soon lie down in its unbroken gloom, Forsaking all our treasures for the tomb, Forgetting all our occupations here, Foregoing all our Heart-affections dear, For ever and for ever—Oh! no more To hope and dream as we were wont before, No more to dwell in joy, 'mongst well known things, To which the natural heart so fondly clings, So fondly and so firmly, till, alas! It finds its joys were only made to pass. How soon we close our longing lingering eyes On all that we most fervently could prize, Most deeply cherish, and leave all behind Which claimed the strong devotion of the mind; Death from our sight doth all these things remove, Howe'er we watched them with a jealous love, And then our title we perforce resign (Oh! Death, how harsh a tyranny is thine) To all we held most sacredly our own, And yield it up as though we ne'er had known We have a grave on Earth! 'tis all we have— And that the Monarch shareth with the Slave, 'Tis all we truly certainly possess— Though Fortune rain her fair gifts to excess Upon our honoured and our favoured heads— And in our paths Hope's form of Beauty treads! 'Tis all we have—though we may seem to be Rich in deep sources of felicity; On this bleak Earth 'tis all indeed we have, Our only home is in that silent cave!— There all of woman born must surely dwell, Palace and Prison—Court and Citadel— Since that dark place of rest alone remains To those who dwelt in piles like idol fanes! A handful of dim dust is all indeed That ev'n the loftiest and the best shall need, Ere many years above their heads are flown, And this is all that can be all their own. We have a Grave on Earth—a lowly Grave, And those long tossed on Life's distracting wave May lay their heads down on that Earth at last, And gladly say, “the weary time is past!” For Sorrow pierces with her poisoned dart The yearning anxious fevered human heart, And doubt disturbs it and remorse o'ertakes, Until with secret longing oft it aches For that unbroken, that undreaming rest, With which the sleeper of the Grave is blest, That silent and all motionless repose Which blesseth those whose eyes for ever close!— Which heareth heedeth not the echoing strife, Around, above, of restless warring Life— We have a Grave on Earth—that, that alone Can be indeed and certainly our own— All other things depart from us, or we Depart from them howe'er unwillingly, The miser ceases his convulsive hold Upon his darling and long-treasured gold, The Monarch quits his proud and glittering throne, And goes, where he is watched and served by none. The bridegroom turns him haply from his bride, Content in solitary gloom to abide— The warrior leaves his triumphs all behind, And yields his honours with an humbled mind. Man to the Grave must turn—of all bereft— He finds at length the Grave alone is left, And this austere possession, this is all That we our own with perfect truth can call. Rash, reckless beings—while we hurry on, Nor value Time till precious Time is gone! As though the World and all it hath were ours, And we were dwellers in unfading bowers; A Grave—a Grave on Earth! dark, narrow, drear, And can this World then be so deeply dear, 'Twould seem as though we were in life the lords Of boundless empire, and exhaustless hoards, Enriched with gifts immortal and sublime, That never might be crushed or reft by Time? Alas! how different 'tis! how brief our tale, How slight our tenure, and our trust how frail, We strive and struggle for a little while, Then sets that Sun that never more shall smile On our fond efforts, or our darling schemes, And all our hopes depart like morning dreams, We close our eyes on this World's busy scene, And nothing is for us that ere hath been, For we are nothing—we ourselves are nought, And Death hath overta'en the winged Thought— From his dread power no skill no strength can save, On Earth we have a Grave, and but a Grave! This World with all its glory, all its bloom, Is but for us a proud and spacious tomb, A sure and mighty sepulchre it is, And all we claim of it as ours—is this— And shall we cling then with an ill placed trust, False to our interest—to ourselves unjust? To all the uncertain good it hath to give, Which soon must cease, since soon we cease to live, And worship at this World's unhallowed shrine, Nor to a loftier hope and trust incline, Unthinking Mortals!—all proclaims ye have On Earth a Grave—and nothing but a Grave! And all proclaims, with voice as deep and loud, To ye, the rash, the insatiate, and the proud, That ye indeed have in the Heavens above A God Omnipotent, of Grace and Love! A Grave on Earth—but, Oh! a God in Heaven, Can you forget His Love and be forgiven? 'Tis boundless, endless, evermore the same, And all their portion in its truth may claim The lowliest and the mightiest of the Earth, The strongest and the weakest, from their birth, Until the hour appointed for their death, And, Oh! yet after they resign their breath— Then shall it be in all its greatness shown, For ever still unchangeably their own— A treasure far beyond all powers of thought, To appreciate and to acknowledge as they ought! Were all yon shining Worlds on Man bestowed With which the irradiate space streams overflowed, Those Suns of many Splendours, that outblaze At nameless distances, with glittering rays, 'Twere as a handful of unvalued dust Compared with that deep treasure of our trust! Light in the balance these were found indeed Weighed 'gainst that wealth which must all else exceed. Then let us listen to thy call sublime, Thou swift and sure and ne'er delaying Time, And lift our Souls up with a reverent love, Even to the Heaven that brightly spreads above! For if we may but have a Grave on Earth, A treasure there is ours of priceless worth, A certain and a lasting one, which nought Can snatch from our firm hold—with rapture fraught! Oh! let us unto that unfaultering cling, And raise our hopes from each low Earthborn thing, Give all our Souls to that, and that alone— And claim it, seize it, clasp it for our own; Speak on, thou solemn chime! speak ever on, And let me dwell thy counsel sage upon, Speak on, and let my spirit wakening thrill With one deep echo to that counsel still! How many thoughtless or obdurate hear That voice of Time which lingers on the ear— With grave deep warning, as they onwards pass, To where his swiftness speeds them still, alas! Even to that long and lone and lasting home Of hopeless silence—and of changeless gloom, Yet beautiful as Paradise in sight Of those who mark behind it Heaven's own light! Speak on! thou eloquent and solemn chime, Speak to my Soul in language all sublime, Since it is Truth itself—triumphant truth! Oh! wise are they who prize it in their youth, Ere weakened energy and lessened strength Smite with decay the Soul's best powers at length, And render difficult that task enjoined, To lift from Earthly things the Earth-stained mind! Aid me! Eternal Source of grace and good, Aid me to exalt my mind's taught tutored mood— To turn from all these petty Worldly things, Which taint the Spirit to its deepest springs; Aid me to love thyself, thyself to serve, Nor let me from the course of duty swerve, Keep me, Oh! keep me in the right, true way, My judgments 'stablish, and my feelings sway, Make me to feel with chastened awe, and know That this a state of trial is below, That nothing can deserve Man's watchful care On this dim scene, where all one fate must share, One doom must find, a stern and mournful doom, Give back thy hollow echo-answer—Tomb! Awake, ye dreamers, that with vainest love Seek all below—forgetting all above! Awake, awake, ere yet it is too late To amend your prospects and improve your fate, Hear but the warning of that solemn chime, Which calls with voice as startling as sublime, And sternly doth unceasingly proclaim One mighty truth—and evermore the same:— “The hours are speeding towards Life's final hour, Awake, arouse, while yet 'tis in your power.” Awake, arouse then, Dreamers—cast away The unmeaning trifles o'er your Souls that sway, The little time that Heaven shall yet allow, Oh! give it to your preparation now, Since on that preparation must depend Your future good and glory without end. How merciful is Heaven to thankless Man, Even in his brief and strictly measured span, How doth he find at every step he takes, Some warning, which its just impression makes Upon his yearning and expectant mind, If not with wilful stubborn dulness blind! A gracious Father guides our course from Heaven, Can we forget His Love, and be forgiven? Can we resign our claims to His deep Grace, And hope in peace to end our mortal race? Can we with careless impious folly, turn From His own paths, and dream we shall not mourn? A voice within us answers deeply, No! A voice within us, speaking clear and low, And that too echoeth thy prophetic call, Oh! Time!—that cryeth loudly unto all With iron tongue of dread and stern appeal, Which even the giddiest at some moments feel, “Prepare!”—and yet again “Prepare!” again, And oft again to reckless heedless men— But doth it only echo thy strong cry? Oh! it hath syllabled thy wordless sigh, And breathed its mystic music, full and deep O'er thy stern tone, till the hours might seem to weep O'er all that they destroy with dull decay, So gently do they warn their destined prey! So mildly urge them as they speed along, To save their living Souls from blight and wrong, To buckle on that armour pure and bright, Which still can save them from such wrong and blight. Speak on, thou hollow-sounding chime, and say, “Ye have a Grave on Earth!”—Man may not stay 'Mongst these, his old familiar Worldly things, Time flieth fast, his Soul too hath her wings, Not still she standeth, 'mid the motion round, But striveth to press on beyond her bound, To leave behind the associates of her way, Those Earth-born things that must endure decay, Even the most thoughtless Worldling feels at times One thought within him that aspiring climbs, And soars away an instant from the din That echoing soundeth in this World of Sin, One thought that trembleth like a Heavenly Star Amid the cloudy darkness and the war, The wild confusion and the waste of life, The restless hurry and the heated strife— And if that thought be not insanely chased, As though the immortal spirit it disgraced, The Star will to a glorious Sun outblaze, And light created Nature with its rays! Since still it clear pronounceth evermore What Nature too hath oft pronounced before, Repealing that stern sentence of dismay Which speaks but of the Grave and Death's dire sway, And fearlessly asserts, in accents plain, “Ye have a God in Heaven!”—Oh! blessed strain, Let all the Soul take up with hallowed zeal Its perfect harmony—her wounds to heal, Her griefs to banish, and her fears to lull, While thence she may unbounded rapture cull, And draw a consolation all divine, Which shall with every conscious thought entwine. Oh! more than Happiness—joy-shaming Hope, What prospects lengthening and expanding ope Before the Spirit's all-enraptured sight, Glory on Glory heaped—Light after Light, Still new variety of dazzling Day That drives the thought of Darkness ev'n away. Joy-shaming Hope! how startlingly sublime Dost thou spring forth to gild the brow of Time, Which like some mighty Angel speeds, as fain Its goal, the glorious gate of Heaven, to gain, And melt into the Eternity supreme, As melteth into truth some wandering dream. Oh! more than Happiness! Surpassing Hope, Scarce can the Soul with thy great triumph cope, To live for ever 'mid those Worlds of bliss, Too bright, too blessed to be glimpsed in this, Where Death nor Grief nor Pain nor Sin nor Fear, Nor even their fleeting shadows may appear Perfect with all perfection, deep and true, Within themselves, and circled with it too! Oh! Happiness-surpassing Hope!—to thee Still let us cling through our Mortality, Nor from our thoughts be thou e'er banished far The Soul's victorious and undying Star! Ne'er from our thoughts may this great Truth be driven, We have a Grave on Earth—a God in Heaven! EARTHLY AFFECTION. How pass the unloving and the unloved, Whose hearts no Heav'n-born thrill have proved, Through this dark waste, this World unkind, Where poisons tempt and fetters bind, Where storms are scathing—snakes are stinging, And woes on woes the heart are wringing. How pass they, without prop or aid, With burthens on their shoulders laid, With dangerous passes to attempt, Nor from attack and wrong exempt— Without Love's aid and blest protection?— Oh! surely crushed with vain dejection. Heed, heed not what the selfish say, “Love rules with harsh and fearful sway, Preserve from Love the throbbing heart, And 'twill be saved from Sorrow's smart!” Aye! 'twill be saved from every feeling, Whose Heavenly hurt wins Heavenly healing. For true it is that Happiness Not alway doth deep Feeling bless, But Oh! is not its precious tear Than Happiness itself more dear? And when bright joy its truth is blessing, That joy exceedeth all expressing! Its very sorrows even are dear— And beautiful and fair appear— Since consolations from above Ever are lent to wounded Love! Oh! the fond Martyrs of Affection, Walk not this Earth in vain dejection. But they, the unloving and the unloved, Whose hearts no generous thrills have proved, While they have sorrows too to bear, No Heavenly healing to their share May fall, those sorrows' pangs to soften, Though they shall own their keenness often! The sorrows of the selfish breast Are unexalted and unblest— And could the loveless guess or know The solace of a nobler woe— The joy-commingled griefs of Feeling, Would they not pine with vain appealing? Would they not crave of Heaven alone To wake their Souls to that fine tone Of more than richest harmony, Which thrilleth and which swelleth free— That tone of tenderness enthralling, Like echoes of Heaven's music falling? Would they not envy all who know Deep Sympathy's mysterious glow, And scorn their own low little joys, Vain dreams which every breath destroys, And turn with fond and deep desiring, To Love and to Love's truth aspiring? Oh! surely it must ev'n thus be, Could they pierce thy sweet mystery, Affection!—bright and gentle power! Life's precious and ætherial flower! But of such power—the Soul commanding, They have in sooth no understanding! Still must they feel some consciousness, Some trouble of a vain distress, When they, the adoring and the adored, Whose Souls on one rich hope are poured, Meet them amidst Life's mazy turnings, Till ache their hearts with hopeless yearnings. Oh! be those hearts of stone or steel, The unloving and the unloved must feel, Must mourn their state, yet undeplored, When thus the adoring and the adored, With Love's own perfect sunlight beaming, Cross them on paths of their vain scheming. The loved upon the loveless look— And scarce can read their hearts' dim book, Yet what they can decypher there, Must claim some pity, some kind care, For, Oh! to the beloved how dreary Must seem the unloved one's paths, how weary! And let them not with harsh disdain Shrink from those sufferings—from that pain— Which pierce the hearts no hope may bless, At sight of others' happiness!— No! be Love's Heaven-taught lore imparted Unto the lone and heavy-hearted! LINES. (FROM AN UNPUBLISHED POEM.) She comes!—she comes!—with her hair of light Bound round a forehead almost as bright With her flashing smiles—yet though flashing—soft That seem a deep Soul on their wings to waft With her kindling blushes—her lovely mien— The Star and the Spirit of the scene!— With her silvery voice and her zephir step, With her clear bright cheek and her laughing lip!— And the Graces with her for ever come— What a Paradise doth she make of home! She comes!—she comes!—and all things appear Bright as herself, when she draws near! THE FAREWELL TO FRANCE. Bright France, adieu!—Adieu! thy laughing plains, Where Peace now lives and gentle gladness reigns, Farewell fair Vineyard-covered France, farewell! Long shall my memory on your sweet scenes dwell, Long and for ever—many a glowing morn Upon thy rosy hills have I seen born, Many a brilliant eve have watched sink down, As if to rest on thy rich woods, whose crown Was then the blazing burning setting Sun, The noblest and the most imperial One! Nought in the unknown Future may avail To crush these memories with o'ercloudings pale. I will believe and hope, for thoughts like these With high and lofty beauty, calmly please And elevate the mind in which they're nursed— In which they're brightly glowingly rehearsed, For Nature and the love of Nature brings A hallowed charm to light all lesser things. Farewell! with all thy vineyards, all thy flowers, Fair golden France—the land of Sunny bowers And teeming fields, from thee I soon must part, But, Oh! to seek the Country of my Heart!— Yet here my Heart awhile a Country found, Since here in thy bless'd chains have I been bound, Thou ever-glorious Nature—more than fair, And wheresoe'er we yield thee worship—there We feel as natives—children of the soil— So closely do those chains around us coil. Not 'mongst the City's crowds have I delayed, But by these Vineyard-bordered stream banks strayed, Not converse held with proud and polished throngs, But with thine aëry and mysterious tongues, Pure Nature ever holy, ever dear, Those tongues that breathe sphere-music in mine ear, That talk the language of the Heavens on Earth, And make an affluence where were else but dearth, For 'tis not Nature! only, what thou art, (From all associative links apart!—) 'Tis what thou 'mind'st us of yet more, far more, That consecrates thy love in our Hearts' core, And makes us turn to thee, with such deep trust, And name thee glorious, holy, fair, august. No! 'tis not what thou art that makes us turn Even thus to thee, with such quick zeal to burn In admiration boundless and supreme, Which girds our spirits with a passionate dream, 'Tis what thou but reflectest as a glass, The glory that can never wane nor pass The invisible perfection, and the unknown, Which then our minds mysteriously must own, Even when to thee we bend with homage deep, And feel thy power our inmost Soul o'ersweep, Thou'rt but a glass, of all that is above Our hope, our comprehension, and our love— And still our thought will struggle to those heights Where shine Truth's glorious and immortal lights— Where blaze these Splendours infinite, which none May gaze unblasted and unscathed upon!— And still the yearning and the restless mind Will strive the mirror of their pomp to find, Nature—all exquisite and fair in thee, And in thy bright and sovreign Majesty, 'Tis this that lends thee such o'erpowering might, That makes thee seem so blessed in our sight, When we indeed bend humbly at thy shrine, And see in thee a mystic stamp divine. Nature! thou art my Country! evermore Still let me find a home from shore to shore, Where'er thy chainless winds in freedom blow, Where'er thy glitt'ring streams rejoicing flow, Where'er thy mountains soar, thy groves expand, There smiles my Home—and there my Native Land, Where'er thy glorious Stars resplendent shine, And make the purple Heavens indeed divine— Or thy more lovely flowers their brilliant dyes Display with all their rich varieties, Where'er thy clouds in shadowy beauty roll, And catch the thoughts of the uplifted Soul, And bear them on with them on their wild race, Through wastes of æther and through worlds of space, Beyond the horizon's aëry line afar, Where faintest lights and tenderest shadows are, There is my Soul's own place, and there my home, And there must I a denizen become, Bound by dear ties of Feeling and of Thought, With tenderness and truth and transport fraught. Where'er afar with wandering foot we range, It is the strangers make the land seem strange, The mighty hills, the fields, the paths, the woods, The glades of beauty, and the sounding floods, These are not strangers—if we shun the croud, The weak, the vain, the restless, and the loud, And but with these beloved associates keep— For us a Home shall smile o'er mount and deep, Our Country, Nature, shall be where thou art, Our resting place for ever on thy heart. And yet a dearer charm must doubtless dwell Round that one Land, where first from flood and fell We learned to draw a deep and true delight, And recognized thy glory and thy might! That, may perchance be dearer than the rest, But all shall be as Homes of love confessed By hearts that prize thee as thou should'st be prized, Great Nature—but by mindless fools despised, For the high thoughted and the wise of Earth Have ever owned thy deep exceeding worth, And ever thy prevailing power avowed, And at thy shrine with reverent homage bowed, For thou'rt the Daughter of the Highest—thou Alone to His Perfection deign'st to bow, Man's thoughts do shape themselves even at thy side, (With a permitted pardonable pride) To actual Forms, his floating dreams become Realities—for in his mortal doom, His high immortal Nature still aspires, And feels the impulse of diviner fires— Struggling within his Spirit—quickening there— To find a clearer, purer, finer air! And to thy great Perfection still they yield, Though thou for ever art the same revealed, And they, yet day by day—age after age, Mankind's profoundest care and thoughts engage, For ever open to improvement thus Transmitted down through myriad minds to us, Full often yet thy works mock brightly still Those works of human toil and human skill— Let me be still a Worshipper of thine— And ever to thy wild sweet haunts incline— Then, wheresoe'er it be my fate to roam, There shall I find a Sanctuary and Home, From the glad hills, the gracious Heavens above, Thy countenance o'ershadoweth me with love, The language of my thoughts must ever be Even thy large universal language free! The torrents and the Stars they shine and roll, And speak to every feeling of my Soul— The whispering leaves sweet secrets can impart Unto my listening and enraptured heart— One instrument with Nature that is made— And by one touch they're wakened and they're played! The Forest-lyre's resounding strings sublime, And thy more subtile strings keep tune and time. Oh! mine accordant Heart!—since thy reply So instant is—thy frame one harmony— The Ocean's Organ-anthem calls at once From my rapt Spirit's depths its full response!— Itself one mighty melody becomes, Such as the Seraphs wake in their Starred homes, One strain of perfect Love—one glorious strain Beyond all music of the hymning Main, All minstrelsy of the echoing Forest's heart, The harping Forest whence blest sounds depart Unceasingly, or if the storm or breeze Awake the sleeping spirit in the trees!— Nature! thou art my Country!—where thou art I find the Home—the Heaven of my Heart! I kiss my Parent-soil for ever there, And breathe mine own familiar kindred air, All is congenial to my Soul and Thought, Where all with thine exalted charms is fraught, Thy Child—thy Citizen—still let me be, My Native Land—Oh! Nature!—it is thee! WHEN JOY IS LIVING. When joy is living at our hearts— How fair a World this seems to be, All Nature into Beauty starts— And all is smiles and harmony. The very clouds that hide the Sun Look strangely beautiful and bright, Fair colours seem they to have won, From some more Heavenly Orb of Light! The very shadows that are cast Along our happy Hope-lit way, Seem but too exquisite to last, Too delicate and dear—to stay! When Sorrow chains us—what a change Comes o'er the face of Earth and Sky, Joy doth its golden smile estrange Even from the great Sun's glorious eye! When the worn heart is ill at rest, And trembling 'twixt faint hopes and fears, All Nature seems in mourning drest, And all around us is in tears! When Pain becomes the bosom's guest, In darker and in sterner years— All Nature seems in sable vest— The Heavens—the Air—the Earth—in tears! THE BARK. Oh! thou wert launched in triumph, Bark! In gladness and in hope— What breast could dream of care or cark, What spirit then could droop? Cheerily thou careeredst—Bark!— While thy straightened streamer flew, And shone like a Star through the glimmering dark, Like a rainbow the day-time through! Terribly didst thou struggle—Bark! With thy streamer soiled and torn, That erst flew high like the gay skylark, Up—up in the light of morn! Terribly didst thou struggle—Bark! When the tempest ruled the hour, Thou seemedst but as a helpless mark For the billows' strokes of power! When the storms came down, when the great winds roared, Like maddened lions fierce— And the sounds of wrath went all abroad, Even the Ocean-depths to pierce. Silently thou art dwelling—Bark! In those depths' black keyless hold, In the gloomy silence—the gloomy dark— In the stillness and the cold. O'er thy deck is the heavy sea-weed trailed, There the finny people play, Thy lofty sides they are stained and scaled, Thou'rt check'd on thy foamy way. And they that sunk with thee—foundered Bark! The loved—the prized—and the lost! Ah! surely they in a surer ark Were borne to a bright bright coast! The roar of the Seas and Winds no more Shall fill them with trembling fear, They are landed safe on the unstormy shore Of a bright and deathless sphere! RELIGIOUS MUSIC. How doth the Soul on Music's wings arise To join the hymning Seraphs in the Skies, Ascending—still ascending—borne above By strength of zeal—and ecstacy of love! The Organ peal on peal sends forth sublime, Till its deep Music seems to pierce Old Time, To startle him mysteriously, and smite Upon his awful and destructive flight! To unveil his shadowy and cloud-mantled brow, To make him seem one ever present Now— Shorn of his angry terrors, in that hour, And taught to yield before a mightier power, Of all his buried secrets robbed, at once, And made to utter forth a deep response To those triumphant sounds, that searching sweep O'er depths that heavy Silence long did keep! Like Ocean-treasures dashed by storms on shore, Behold the mysteries of his ancient lore, For one keen moment to the Soul revealed, That clasps within itself Creation's field, Even while it giveth back its large reply To the awful thunder-chimes of Harmony, And rushes back unto the birth of all, And lifts from Chaos' wastes of gloom the pall, And forward rushes to the final close, And the whole truth in one rich rapture knows, Or feels as though it knew—in that bright mood By cold dull natures little understood, Oh! glorious is the Organ's swelling hymn In ears that never heard the Seraphim Sing to their Harps of Heaven—for nought beside Methinks can match its Music's pealing pride! Eternity, the while those echoes roll, Crowds with its weight of ages on the Soul— This World seems rapt and gathered unto thee, Through this dread charm—thou great Eternity! A march of Empires rallies round the notes, A mighty history from the old Silence floats, And glides into the electrifying tones, A Vision of long-ruined Fanes and Thrones, Of royal cities in past times destroyed, Whose names are nothing—and whose place a void. Yea! of a bye past World—that startles forth In its own pristine pride and ancient worth, Yet all seems to the enraptured Soul to be As part and portion of the Eternity! Itself, it soars, beyond the grasp of Time, And bids all share in its own state sublime, 'Tis then all consciousness, all ear and eye— New modes of Being seems it then to try More glorious than it ever tried before, (But which shall be its own for evermore; Which yet shall be for evermore its own, When this frail Frame of things is overthrown, When this low World lies crushed in its own dust, And joy eternal crowns the good and just.) Peal on—peal on thou high and glorious strain, Thy mighty Music shall not peal in vain; Oh! not in vain shall those fine concords flow, They free the heart from long devouring woe, They break the Soul's too closely clasping chains, And clear it both of shadows and of stains— And yet amidst its wildest farthest flight, Its richest burst of Inspiration's might, Its noblest and its most etherial mood, How much of Earth will evermore intrude, The pride of human triumphs, human sway, Of human Majesty the proud array, These still are glimpsed and visioned by the Soul, These still before its inner sight unroll, The mighty Anthem swells upon the sense, A pomp of sound—an angel eloquence, And there awakes deep dreams of loftiest power, That soar beyond Time's less than little hour, Yet with them bear to the awful heights above, Through vain tenacity of clinging love, Or haply custom's long-continuing force, (A current that scarce turneth from its course Of partial prejudice)—all things known here, All things that glorious in man's sight appear, Bear Earth itself, and Earth's chief pomps on high, Time's triumphs all into the Eternity, For still their images victorious reign, Within the working wildered human brain, And still the winged and fervent human Soul Escapes from strictest bonds of Time's controul, In those harmonious and half-Heavenly hours, When Music stirs the inmost Spirit's powers, When sacred strains o'erwhelmingly impart Melodious deep Religion to the heart. THE ARAB CHIEF. Full sadly mourned the lonely Arab Chief, With tones of tenderness—and looks of Grief, The while he stood beside his dying steed, For whom might help be none in his sore need, For death triumphant scowl'd beside his prey, And step by step advanced his hideous sway, Thus burst, in saddest accents deep and low, Forth from the Chieftain's lips the plaints of woe. Thou art dying, dying fast, my steed, And I look on thee the while— Thou'rt struggling in the mortal pangs, Thou—the sharer of my toil— Companion of my wanderings free, Aye! and friend, firm friend and true, Thou art dying, dying fast, my steed— Must I watch this dark hour through? As a bugle, was to thee my voice, As a beacon-light mine eye, My light caress thy proudest joy, Must I stand to see thee die! How wert thou wont triumphantly The Morning's air to snuff, Then to dart upon thy foaming course, Till thy master cried “Enough!” Like the tempest-wing of rushing Night, Of Lightnings and of Fire, Didst thou bear thy rider on and on, With a strength that could not tire, Now waxing very weak thou art, And thine eye is filmed and dull. Oh! must I stand to see thee die, Brave steed and beautiful? And say, was not unto me the light Of thy glorious eye a star, And thy nostrils furious snorting loud, As a sudden tromp of War? The waving of thy streamy mane, As a banner free and proud, My gallant gallant steed of strength— Must the dust thy fair frame shroud? Must our long companionship close now, My comrade and my friend, Must I seek another, stranger steed, Or alone in sorrow wend, What other steed shall bear me, horse, As thou evermore hast borne O'er the desert's trackless boundless paths, As't were on the wings of Morn? Thy front was like the outshining East, When 'tis set in flames by Day, Thy broad bold warrior front—thine eye E'en as a fount of fire did play, Thunder-cloathed was thy mighty neck, And thy hoofs were shod with speed, And terrible-gentle wert thou still, Oh! my gallant glorious steed! But thy fiery grandeur soon must be In the heavy dust laid low— Thou that hast borne me like the wind From the arrows of the foe! Thy pride of strength and thy boast of speed, These can nothing now avail, Thou fail'st as a weed borne down the stream, As a reed bowed in the gale! Oh! where the fountain of the wild Laughed sparkling up and fair, How oft have we together stopped, While each hath drank his share, The draught was dearer from my hands, My noble horse, I know, And must I watch thy dying pangs, Oh! woe—Oh! tenfold woe! My children aye have played with thee, And climbed thee without fear, For gentle wert thou with them still, As they to thee were dear! Thy fathers have served my fathers well And loyally through their line, Since no Chief-descended-Chiefs may boast Of blood more pure than thine! When the dreadful Simoom-columns vast With their deadly purple gloom, Have threatened us, how thy flashing speed Hath saved me from the tomb! And must I with these hands scoop now Thy dismal narrow grave, And hide thee—Son of Morning—thee, In the dust—thou true and brave! In the shadow of my quiet tent Shalt thou take thy peaceful rest, Calm while the Sun of Victory sleeps As 'mid clouds quenched on thy breast, Low in the shadow of that tent (An unneeded shade, alas!)— Take thy long and lasting rest, brave horse, While ages rise and pass! Aye! the stormy Sun of Victory sleeps On thy breast of thunder now, Setting 'midst gathering shadows there, That come dimly on, and slow, And within thine eye the blaze grows dull, The quick and fiery blaze, Through thy nostrils rolls no more the smoke Of thy breath, a thousand ways. Thou'rt helpless now in weakness grown, And power departs from thee, Thou that in fulness of thy strength So tameless seemed to be, That haughty strength unbowed, unchecked, 'T was noble—'t was sublime— Thou would'st have made a gallant steed For the restless Rider—Time! Methinks, brave steed! thou might'st have borne The World's eternal weight, Beneath thy burthen rose so high Thy mighty heart elate, Thy dauntless spirit evermore In impatient daring rose, And strong with an unearthly strength Is the frame where that so glows! 'Tis done!—'tis all, all over now— And 'tis a deep relief, Bitter to bear thine anguish t'was, And mine own o'erflowing grief, But now 'tis past, and thou, with all Thy wonted fire, art clay; 'Tis done—'tis done—then let me turn My heavy steps away. And the proud Chief concealed awhile his face In his raised hands, then turned to leave the place, Yet paused awhile and turned and looked again, As though to drain the last worst drop of pain, To hug the whole dark sorrow to his heart, Ere yet from that sad scene he would depart, He looked—then turned with aspect sad and mild— And wept that Chief—as weeps a little child! THE LARK. Lark! universal singer! go Where the Sunshine-sources seem forth to flow, Bury thyself in that grave of light, Hidden from thought and hidden from sight, Triumphal, strong, and festal singer, Raised thus by thine own zeal on high, In the luxury of thy joyaunce linger 'Mid the rosy chambers of the sky! Glad Minstrel of the Morning—go And sing from the Heaven to Earth below, Let every sweet and hallowed note Charged with celestial meanings float, Go—the strong winds dare not delay thee Upon thy glad and glorying course, Lo! how the liegeless clouds obey thee, As the foeman files, the charging horse! Hark to the ringing rushing song, It bears our very Souls along In dizzying haste beyond—above— Borne on the strength of hope and love; Holiest of Singers—sing thou ever, And draw our spirits up on high, What weak bars shall suffice to sever From the Heaven of deathless harmony! Holiest of Singers—sing thou on, Till for us the heights of thought are won, Till won the heights of thought may be By the Bard of fiery Soul and free, By the enthusiast and the dreamer, By the zealot keen and the lover fond, By even the World's ambitious schemer— And heights, yet the heights of thought beyond! THE SAILOR'S GRAVE. Rest! rest! we give thee to a glorious grave, That nobly suits the breathless martyred brave, Above it—streaming flags of Freedom wave For evermore! Our England's War-ships o'er thy bed shall ride And tower, a moment's monument of Pride, O'er thee ensepulchred in the ancient tide— Far—far from shore! Rest, nor less soundly sweetly calmly rest, For that above thee many a billowy crest, Points in the tempest's hour to Heaven's broad breast, Thy Spirit's goal. Nature reigns round thee awfully supreme, Around, above thy sleep without a dream! And through the thunderbolt, or on the beam Breathes Truth's great Soul! Rest in the stillness of thy lone repose! Unheeding of all human friends and foes, Mayst thou remain till that pure Star that rose Of old, shall rise! The Star of our Salvation more than bright, Whose ray shall spread—a boundless Heaven of Light, And banish everlastingly the Night From Earth and Skies. Then mayst thou lift thy long-unconscious head From forth thy hollow-sounding hoary bed, And join thy brethren, th' Earth's unshrouded Dead, Raised from their sleep. Thousands and tens of thousands shall arise, It matters little whence, if the opening Skies Receive them, to the joy that never dies— From Earth or Deep! Rest, brave and gentle one, in Ocean rest, And be thy slumber of the billows blest— Of perfect peace—'mid storms thou art possessed, Oh! senseless clay! Lo! we commit thee to these waters wide— Awaiting the hour when thou and we aside Shall cast Death's bonds—(for Death must all betide) On Heaven's great day! SWEET FRIENDS—SWEET FRIENDS. Oh! my Sweet Friends! Sweet Friends! forget me not, Still let me be as linked unto your lot— Still let me enter, although far away, Into your sports and schemes day after day, Through Memory's gentle magic, which is strong To bring the absent the bereaved among. Oh! my Sweet Friends! Sweet Friends! forget me not, If aught of pleasure, on the sunny plot, The shadowy bower—the flowery garden-ground, Or in the tranquil chamber may be found, In memory dear of me, then Sweet, Sweet Friends, Forget me not till this dark absence ends! Then think of me with many a gentle thought, With hopes affectionate and wishes fraught, But, Oh! if shadowy Sorrow dimly blends With dreams of me—forget me then, Sweet Friends! Think not of me, think not of me, for I Would not bring Sorrow, e'en in Memory! Sweet Friends, Sweet Friends, but if such Memory twines With bright emotions, and to joy inclines, And mingles with all pleasant things and dear, Think of me—think of me! strong, full, and clear, Then let mine image rise unto your minds Not as a thing that startles and that blinds. Soft as a glow-worm's light through lush green leaves, Which oft the quiet eye half closed receives, Or as a fleecy cloud that melts above— That seems at least to melt in tender love, Let that calm image to your minds appear For ever gentle, ever soft and dear. Think of me haply when the fearless lark Bursts, like the Dove, from old Night's gloomy ark, As though a twin with Morning!—think of one Who heard with rapture every rapturous tone, Whose heart became the echo of the strain, Forgetting every grief and every pain. Think of me when the Nightingale's dear voice Bids some perchance lament and some rejoice, According as their train of thought may be, For she rejoiceth still incessantly, And drinketh ever from her own deep Heart As from an urn, rich joys that ne'er depart! Think of me, friends, when scenes of gladness round, And many a cheering show and cheering sound Keep back regret from the soothed heart of love, Then 'mid soft shadows of remembrance move, So soft they can but make the Sunshine's ray More lightly, brightly, delicately play! Think not of me, Sweet Friends, I still implore 'Mid scenes of sadness that were shadowed o'er Trebly by thoughts of one from your kind band Divided far, and in a distant land, Striving to turn her Memory into Hope, Because with sick regret she ill can cope! Sweet Friends! mine own Sweet Friends! Oh! gentlest Friends! I would not blend with aught that ever blends, Grief'mongst your dreams—thus as it may befall, Forget our joys of Friendship or recall, Thus do for me—Ah! let me thus ev'n be Half an Oblivion—half a Memory! Still do for me as it may ev'n befall Nor quite forget me and nor quite recall— Friends of my heart! ev'n thus do for me yet, Nor quite remember me nor quite forget, Oh! whatsoe'er is for your happiness, Me with reflected blessings still must bless! SONNET. [Proportioned to my Hopes have largely been] Proportioned to my Hopes have largely been Ever my Disappointments—for on Earth Fruit of abortive Promise, dead in birth, Doth evermore abound—and all its scene Is strewed with wrecks and fragments—if we lean Too fondly on the Staff of Hope our mirth Will soon be changed to mourning, and the worth The wonder of Creation's face serene, With all its witchery shall pass swift away, And we shall late and long and much repent, Till we resign this tenement of clay, And pass through darkness by a fearful rent, Made by Death's phantom-fingers—when we pay The unremitted debt and fall like arrows spent. ON MY CHILD'S BIRTH-DAY. This is a day of hope, dear Child of mine, A day of heart rejoicings, for my deep And winged thoughts soar joy-fraught, may Heav'n's care keep Thee ever blessed and pure—and twine—and twine Love's precious chains around thee! Mark how shine The golden Summer Heavens—how laughing leap The sparkling Sunbeams down the aëry steep, 'Twixt Sky and Earth—long may their light divine Unshadowed gleam o'er thee—may no dull mist I' the after days rise from thine own veiled thought, Oh! may the wild winds blow even as they list, But never have the power to bring sounds fraught With terrible meanings unto thee—hark—hist— What hints of Heaven this birth-day-breeze hath brought! SONNET TO SLEEP. Sleep! let me feel thy precious calm at last, In my heart's heart—through all these throbbing veins Diffused in lingering languishments!—thy chains Of heavenliest link, around me lightly cast, And wean my mind from memories of the Past, My dreaming ear shall dwell on soothing strains, A sound such as in the Ocean-shell remains, How sweet when following the harsh howling blast— And to the work-day task—the work-day care Awhile I'll bid adieu—and when the ray Of Morning o'er the horizon gleameth fair, And through the half-closed shutters strives to play, The parting-sweetness of charmed dreams shall bear To after-hours a token of their sway. SONNET. [Sleep's mantle of blest softness soon shall wind] Sleep's mantle of blest softness soon shall wind My thoughts within its folds—charmed folds and deep, And Angel guests thou surely bring'st, bright Sleep, With thee, until the tired and harassed mind That slender portion of repose could find In the loud day—doth priceless blessings reap Of rest and quiet—thou dost richly steep The senses in thy honey-dews refined, And thy caressing gentleness can lull All trouble and all care awhile to rest, Thou hast a Paradise o' the Beautiful, For ev'ry scathed and vision-haunted guest, And dull are they—Oh! poor of thought and dull That have not many a time Sleep's sorceress-power confessed! SONNET. [Oh! Sleep! thou never com'st to me without] Oh! Sleep! thou never com'st to me without A glorious pomp of dreams to swell thy state, Another Life thou art—another Fate— A most dear refuge from the cloudy rout Of cares and fears, and thoughts of strife and doubt, That blight my waking hours, let bright joys wait Upon me now—Oh! honey Sleep create A new World for me—sweetly shed about Thy precious dew's revivifying shower, And I another Being shall become; No more shall Hope deceive or Memory lower, No more shall I be slave to wrath and gloom, No more shall poisonous Nightshade dim my bower, Nor keen frosts crush, each joy's new budding bloom! SONNET. [Dear Child! thy little questions almost wake] Dear Child! thy little questions almost wake Enquiry in my mind—methinks I learn From thee an asking searching eye to turn On all things—and to seek to strip—to shake The obstinate shroudings—and the seal to break— To lift the cov'ring lid too from the urn, And bid the waters gush forth free—to spurn The encumbering Mysteries far—and still to make Enquiries ceaseless—me thou teachest, love, To look on simple things with wonderment, But I who know their mighty source above Should feel all adoration strongly blent With such astonishment—and surely prove Happier, but humbler too, for such deep lessons sent. SONNET. [Beautiful Spring, thy young ambrosial breath] Beautiful Spring, thy young ambrosial breath Now dwells caressingly upon the air, While many a floweret new unfoldeth fair, And all the grey and gloomy hues of Death Which Winter scattered in his rugged wrath, Are charmed away by thee!—thy witcheries rare Bring opiates for our sorrow and our care; Thou sheddest hopes like rose-leaves on our path, Thine every smile, and whisper can enchant A grief or an anxiety away! How dost thou to our restless wishes grant Novelty more than new—each opening day That doth thy reign extend—doth sweetly pant With kindlings of a fresh delight, Oh! keep thy sway! LOVE AND HOME. Oh! gentle, gentle words of Love and Home, Ye bid Hope's Paradise around us bloom, Where'er ye find us on the stormy Sea, Or 'mid the City's crowds that stormier be. Oh! gentlest words, like winds of May ye come Unto our freshened feelings—words of Home, Winning the wanderer back—hearth, bow'r and shrine Recalling—that with all his heart-strings twine. Oh! sweet kind words of Love and Home, the Soul Is stirred and melted by the priceless scroll— That wafts a thousand thousand blessings far, Even from the Eastern to the Western Star. Oh! gentle words of Love and Home, for me Your power must ever e'en as magic be, I dwell on ye, and bower, hearth, hall, and shrine, Once more, once more I feel are sweetly mine! Bless'd words of Love and Home, we cling to ye On the far waste or 'mid the stormy Sea, Would that we clung thus to the words of Love Which pitying Heaven hath sent us from above! 'Midst Life's stern deserts and its sullen gloom, Would that sweet tidings of our Heavenly Home Thus stirred our slumbering thoughts, thus gently wrought A lovely change in the long-troubled thought! Thus soothed away the unrest of bitter life, And calmed the spirit worn by feverish strife, Words from our Heavenly Home—of Heavenly Love, Would that as strong—as mighty, ye could prove! But, Oh! our ears are deafened—dulled our hearts, By worldly din, whose echo ne'er departs, By worldly cares whose shadows ne'er unroll— Or but too seldom, from the enshrouded Soul! Sweet words of Love and Home, thrice blessed words, That should indeed thrill all our bosom's chords, Sent from the Skies, for ever to remind That there our Home of Love we yet may find. Oh! let us still remember, still repeat Those tidings true and holy, deep and sweet, And stamp them in our heart's own living core, Until we reach the Beatific shore! SUMMER THOUGHTS. Chime and chaunt of bee and bird Now are ever sweetly heard In the golden sultriness Of the bright Air's warm excess, How the happy careless things, With their voice and with their wings, Make the scene one living scene— Ev'n the trees' thick leaves of green, Moved by living things of life, Seem to share in the happy strife, Even the Air, re-echoing, Seems to murmur and to sing; Bird and bee and butterfly Their light tasks unwearied ply, Though the Sun glows fierce to-day, Yet they pause not in their play. Bird and butterfly and bee They are strong—for they are free, They know not what 'tis to bear The burthen of a fear or care, Happier than the human herd Bee and butterfly and bird!— They but know their great content And triumphant merriment, They but know their happiness, Would our knowledge too were less, So that this and this alone Might unto our Souls be known! These but know their happiness, And that Nature's truth can bless— Oh! that murmur and that song Of the gay, the aërial throng, Oh! that sound—that dulcet strain— More true wisdom they contain, More real knowledge they impart— (Knowledge precious to the heart) Than the elaborate sophistries Clad in pompous proud disguise, Which so often freely flow From Men's lips who deem they know! Than discourses trite and vain, Couched in artful studied strain, If they none can better make, Vain's the task they undertake, Wiser none through those can grow Though with eloquence they glow— Chaunt and chime of bee and bird More than cunning phrase or word Ye can well inform—instruct— And to golden truths conduct— Ye indeed are eloquent ('Mid that sparkling merriment!)— Perfect Poems that agree— With a sound Philosophy! Ye for ever celebrate (Strains triumphal and elate!) Happiness and Innocence With an artless eloquence! And with heavy sighs I own Could my heart demand alone— Simple pleasures—humble joys— (Shunning Earth's more gaudy toys) And contented be to prove The bliss that flows from Nature's love. Innocence and Happiness Might too my crushed spirit bless— But the sinful human heart Chooseth a less peaceful part, And can only pure be made Through the grace of Heavenly aid— Birds and bees and joyous things! That make the Air alive with wings, And with ever-murmuring sound, Sweet and tender and profound, Nature is enough for ye In her general ministery, Nature's common course must still Every want and wish fulfil, All that ye can e'er require, All that ye can e'er desire, Is provided and supplied In her overflowing tide, All for you is fixed and planned, Nought beyond can ye demand. Happiness and Innocence With a trustful confidence Let us hope that ye may be Still ours—and through Eternity!— If the appointed means we take, And the counselled choice we make— And the commended course pursue— With a spirit meek and true— And fix upon the worthy part With an humble humble heart— Innocence and Happiness Then may ye our spirit bless! THE SAVOYARDS. From Savoy's soil they trooping come Her children in wild bands, With their marmozets and mandolins, To dwell in Stranger-Lands— Aye! the little mountaineers, they leave Their native mountain air, To choak in crowded cities close, And to pine their lives out there. Were it not better to lie down In cabins low but free, Beneath the verdurous shelter broad, Of their own old household tree, To toil with an unresting foot And an unpausing hand, To labour e'en a thousand fold, And to dwell in their own Land! To look up with a trustful eye From their ancestorial sod, And to draw strength from the very Earth Which their dead Forefathers trod, And from the Sky and from the Air Of their Native Country's place. To wring high gifts of courage keen, And to guard their kindred race. But these things seem they not to heed, Bent on beggarly poor gain, And they bid Adieu to Savoy's Hills, That tower o'er flood and plain, With their mandolins and their marmozets, And their tristfully trolled tunes, To wander through the Stranger's streets, And to ask the Stranger's boons! Oh! ye youthful Sons of England!— Ne'er shall such become your lot Till the noble pride of Englishmen And their very name's forgot; There is sure a Virtue in the Soil, And a Talisman in the Air, The happy Sons of England's homes, From such base doom to spare! Oh! what would Britain's offspring bear Of hardship and of toil, Rather than quit their Fatherland, The sweet—the sacred Soil— Ten thousand thousand chain-like ties Still, still detain them there, Where could ye find another home, Sons of our England—where? The Altars of your Religion's Truth, The thresholds of your love— The very Soil beneath your feet, The very Skies above— Hold you with more than magic power, Forbidding ye to roam, The Air—the Ground—the Sky—the Clime— All these are as your home! Without the patriot-spirit proud, To enrich and to secure, The mountain-fortresses are weak, The generous Soil is poor— The Patriot-spirit never fails, And, Oh! it wearieth not, 'T would make the desert wilderness A glad and blooming spot. Back—back—ye little wandering tribes, Back to your mountain-lands, If love makes strong your filial hearts, Your hearts will nerve your hands— The rockiest soil will surely yield Fair produce—Plenty's stores— When works the labourer with fond zeal On the Earth that he adores! BRIGHT WATERS BLUE. Bright Waters blue, Whose very hue Brings thoughts of Heaven into the heart, Sing, roll, and gleam, Oh! sweet, sweet stream, And bid Care's heavy dreams depart. Blue Waters clear, To me how dear, Since here my careless childhood played Your antique strain, Oh! sing again— My heart it ever joyful made. But now your voice Ne'er says rejoice, Oh! stream! beloved and blessed stream!— But mingles faint With my complaint— Too like the sad voice of my dream. Oh! Nature! thou Dost still avow With us a perfect sympathy, Against our will We oft find still Our feelings echoed back by thee. The Stream—the Wind With tone refined, These speak the language of the heart— Sighs to our sighs Breathe sad replies, And thousand echoes trembling start! But when we are glad Art thou e'er sad, Oh! Nature!—tenderest of the kind?— No! thou dost mourn With the forlorn, Rejoicest with the gladsome mind! THE ENGLISH EXILE'S RETURN. Cliffs of my England!—Cliffs of England!—there Stand ye in all your glory and your might, The Sunshine resting on ye gleams more fair From your white pinnacles and points of light. Cliffs of my England!—Cliffs of England!—now Ye chain my gaze down through these starting tears, Tears that all tremblingly at once avow This moment's bliss—the bitterness of years! Cliffs of my England!—Cliffs of England!—keep Your watch sublime o'er her blue kindred Sea— Look down upon that ever-rolling Deep— Part of our Royal England—proud and free! Oh! bounding as its waves is the Exile's heart Rejoicing in this glad and sweet return, If it felt more than grief when forced to part, With more than joy doth it now beat and burn! Cliffs of my England!—Cliffs of England!—hail! My Country greets me from your towering crests, Oh! melt away, soft mist, that spreads to veil Those glorious heights, and on their summits rests. No! rest thou still, soft mist! else that dear sight, Too deeply dear—will overpower my Soul, Bring not from utter darkness to broad light, That wretch whose days for years did Sunless roll. Cliffs of Crowned England!—Cliffs of England! hail Walls of our hallowed temple, stand sublime, And tell the Eternal Stars the same high tale— Unbraved—unblasted—to remotest Time! YES! SOMETIMES I HAVE FELT. Yes! sometimes I have felt my suffering mind As 'twere concentred, calmed, subdued, resigned, And fixed to bear each bitter blow of fate With still composure, humbled and sedate, Oh! that such mood could last—'tis only so That helpless mortals can endure their woe, The struggle is the agony—alas! What is ordained must surely come to pass, And all resistance must be worse than vain, And can but add unto the sum of pain, We shrink indeed but suffer while we shrink, We struggle but are still dragged to the brink! But sometimes have I felt thus calmed, subdued, Wrapt in a still and uncomplaining mood, Would that such mood could last, 'tis only so That we can bear the anguish of the woe! Each thought was lulled into a slumberous calm, And steeped in patient quiet's sacred balm, Yet firm, and with resolve unbending fraught, Aye! to such mood my mind serenely brought Hath been at times—but then again, again, Too soon again it sunk beneath the pain! At times this stillness of Soul beneath The affliction, terrible as coming death! And then again, as 'twere an inward crash, A strife, a shock, as when the wild winds dash The sea to storms, dark thoughts that crowding come, Make my Soul all a wildness and a gloom, And my mind falls as 'twere in ruins there, And every feeling sinks in its despair, Yes! my mind falls as 'twere in ruins then, Ruins that never may be raised again! SONNET. ['Twas a fair spot, though little to remark] 'Twas a fair spot, though little to remark, Stamped it peculiarly upon the mind, But all was smoothly fair, and there reclined I felt myself as 'twere in some sweet ark Of Peace—all gloom and strife and care and cark I did resign awhile—and of my blind And busy Worldly speculations twined So often with the heart-strings, wild and dark, Found myself freed! Such hours do come with light, We laugh at Care's keen sting and Grief's dread shaft, Young dreams and glowing fancies, with swift flight Far from this Earth our Souls serenely waft, And with prevailing gentleness invite To realms where Life is not an Art—a Craft! THE SPANISH EXILE'S LAMENT. Oh! ye blue and warbling Waters stray At your own sweet will, your own sweet way, Nor blend one sorrowing tone among The glad sounds of your liquid song, For her who dieth—dieth far From her own beloved Western Star. Hills of my Sunny, Sunny Spain, Must ye look down on the corse-strewn plain? Streams of my lovely Land afar, Must your waves in blood image back the Star? Oh! Valleys of my Country sweet, Must ye groan beneath Ruin's trampling feet? Then the absent One is blest to be Spared the stern sight of thy misery, Far from thy Hills, and far from thy Plains, Where discord—where devastation reigns— In the dreams that rise up at Love's command, Still can I hail thee a Happy Land! Then let me, my Sunny, Sunny Spain, Far from thy strife-cursed Soil remain, And see thy Hills, thy Plains, and thy Streams, Only in Memory's embalming dreams— Since still thou seem'st, though thus wrung thou art, As a Happy Land to my yearning heart! THE HOUR OF STORM. The hour of Storm hath passed away, And how sweet an hour succeeds, Ah! oft the Storm through storm and wrath To light and gladness leads. Now now comes forth the Sun in all The greatness of his power, And never looks he lovelier than In his fair relenting hour! Oh! never prouder doth he look Than when he cometh forth From out the darkness of the gloom, And the glad World owns his worth! The fields and groves laugh out and sing To his glory and his praise, And wear like jewels dazzlingly The splendour of his rays! How he breathes away the breadths of gloom From the valleys and the hills, From the old Mountain-Vineyard-Ground's repose, And the sparkling rain-swoln rills. Creation's varying countenance Now brightly changed appears, And one universal smile spreads fair Where showered unnumbered tears. And those very tears are turned into The smile's most dazzling lights! Myriads of raindrops glass the Sun Like Stars in cloudless nights! Even so Grief's stormy hours and stern, The troubled hours of life, May lead unto the loveliest hours, Spared from all dreams of strife! And the tears we shed in bitterness May a Heavenly wealth become— Making the Soul one splendour then, In the lands beyond the tomb! All that appears most darksome now— May then most brightly shine— For different from all light on Earth Shall blaze the Light Divine! THE SOLEMN HOUR. 'Tis a delicious hour—the twilight comes, Comes with faint Heavenly lights and Heavenly glooms, For like the shadow of sweet Heaven above, Lies on the Earth that dimness soft as love. The still small voices of the varying breeze, Go lightly, sweetly through the murmuring trees, And through the flower-leaves that seem whispering back Yet stiller smaller voices—on its track. The Stars come slowly out, each seems to be A new Creation—called up suddenly From the abyss of space, ne'er seen before, And if once lost, then to be seen no more! Oh! solemn hour, to me thou still dost seem To make my bye-gone life appear one dream! Thou makest seem for evermore to me— The Shadow, Earth!—Heaven the Reality! SERENADE. Lovely Lady—Lovely Lady, Listen, listen to my song, Myrtle-thickets sweet and shady Tempted my stray steps along! Sweet Señora—Sweet Señora, Well I knew the pleasant path, (Surely slumber's cloud broods o'er her, Or she hides herself in wrath!) Dark-eyed charmer—dark-eyed charmer, If disdain that heart can prove, Let Pity be the soft disarmer— Turning that disdain to love. Donna Bianca!—Donna Bianca!— Spurn'st thou me with scornful mind— From Seville search to Salamanca— A truer lover shalt thou find? Proud Señora!—Cold Señora!— Say, can nothing touch thy heart, Wilt thou let thy wrong'd adorer Heartless, hopeless—hence depart? Donna Bianca—Donna Bianca, Now my fatal fault I see, The fairest maid of all La Mancha I forsook—forsook for thee! Cold Señora!—Proud Señora!— Now my fatal fault I feel, Repentant let me kneel before her, She this broken heart shall heal. Donna Bianca!—Donna Bianca!— Darkest mine of lovers' dooms, But I haste to sweet La Mancha, Away!—hush—hist—she comes!—she comes! THE UNKNOWN. Alas! from me, from me thou turnest, Thou dost not know me—canst not know, And chance the while thou pinest and mournest For something like to me below! Thou lov'st me not as thou believest, And all the while the truth may be Thou inly pin'st, and mournest, and grievest For one the counterpart of me! Woe, woe is me I cannot shew thee All that I am in mind and heart, But vague faint hints alone can throw thee— For minds like mine still dwell apart. Thou dream'st not all I am—my Dearest, I cannot show thee all I am— Thou mayst be all that thou appearest, And I—no semblance false I sham! And yet—'tis true—I speak in sadness— We are but strangers—strangers still— Hope thou 'rt vain—thou'rt worse than madness, Thy charmed cup I fain would spill! Yes! yes! 'tis vain—on this Earth never Can we otherwise become— Vain the hope and the endeavour, Let me bear my bitter doom. Since 'tis not mine, Love! to discover The depths of my full Soul and Mind, With Night and Silence mantled over, And all in Mystery's cloud enshrined. Scarce to myself can I uncurtain Those deep dark secrets of my Soul, All is vague, dim, strange, uncertain, Ne'er e'en can I look through the whole! My hopes, my dreams, my thoughts, my feelings, My passions—powers—my joys and woes— These, these on Earth have no revealings, Far too intense still to disclose. And could I Thought by Thought unfolding, My Life's whole History teach to thee— Bare every dream to thy beholding— 'Twould stiil but vain and useless be! My Sorrows thus in stern exposure Might be sounded—seen by thee— My Mind's emotions find disclosure, They're not that Mind itself—not Me! As through Life's winding paths we travel, We vary oft with varying fate, And oft 'tis easy to unravel Our Soul's assumed adopted state! Easy to fathom—and to follow The currents of our Spirit's change, All born of this dull World is hollow— And narrow at its noblest range. But still unchanging, still unaltered— That Spirit's inmost self remains— It hath not fluctuated nor faultered— Unmoved by pleasures and by pains! And where all fire that Spirit burneth, Quickening with an intenser life— Each thought, each feeling strongly learneth To struggle more in glorious strife Far lesser circumstance can wake them— Far weaker influences impress— Far less can rouse—far less can shake them— Too much for peace and happiness! And they grow dark too and mysterious, Through their intense untold excess— Profound and mighty—fervent—serious— And veiled in dim and far recess! And none may mark them, none may measure They within themselves lie coiled With their torture—or their treasure, As their hope is fixed or foiled! They within themselves lie folded In their woe or in their weal, As they have been mixed and moulded— As strong Fate hath stamped its seal! Such my feelings are—so hidden— Such my thoughts—so undisclosed— They sprang to fiery life unbidden— And undestroyed have long reposed— For in my heart's core sealed and shrouded, They for ever hushed remain— As though they were uncrossed—unclouded— Heirs of Peace and not of Pain! But Pain hath been their mighty Master, Pain hath been their Liege and Lord, And o'er that heart still fast and faster, A rain of ashes hath been poured. Pain hath been their tamer tyrant— Pain hath long sought to destroy— Each was once a glad aspirant— For triumphant deathless joy! Now, alas! the difference—dimly Now the torch of Hope doth shine— Fear's stern shadows, stretching grimly, Threaten e'en that spark's decline. Yet are they destroyed or weakened?— Are they tamed by torture's might?— Are their energies e'en slackened?— Are they bowed by Misery's blight If to be compressed—concentered— Gathered in their strength and power— (Since the deadly iron entered In my Soul in fatal hour!) If to be for ever sleepless— Brooding o'er their bitter doom, In their heavy state and hapless, In their deep and deepening gloom. If to be for ever dreaming— Dreams of fire that doom despite, Like strange meteors streaming, streaming Through a pitchy pall-wrapped Night. If to be, while life is lengthening, Struggling still to loftier height— Strengthening with mysterious strengthening, Day by Day, and Night by Night. Aye! through Life's labyrinthine lengthenings, Still uniting power to power, Strengthening with mysterious strengthenings, Day by day—and hour by hour. If to be with pent flames glowing, Enkindling ever—though in vain— With ventless springs, fast overflowing Still into themselves again! If this be to be worn and weakened, Then must they be weak indeed, If this be to be shorn and slackened, Oh! how they must fail at need! Lo!—unfathomably streaming Flow these Passion-fountains still, Unextinguishably beaming Burn these fires, through grief and ill. Ever—evermore excelling Their past selves in depth and force, Strongly welling—strongly swelling, Those wrung feelings keep their course. Mighty beyond all expression, Fervent beyond all display— Gaining ever fresh accession Of livelier strength and loftier sway! But thou—Oh! thou mayst never know them— What may break the fatal spell?— Could I in their truth but show them— Then all must, all would be well! This consciousness I still am feeling, (It racks the heart it doth rejoice!) That nothing needs but truth revealing— To make me the object of thy choice. The consciousness is mine for ever That thou must love me couldst thou know, And is that destined to be never, Must both be lorn and lone below? I thus barred darkly from bestowing The treasures thou wouldest fondliest prize, Thou with a secret Passion glowing For one that on thy dreams doth rise. For one that haunts thy wandering fancies— The dear creation of thy mind— Which enthralls thee and entrances— Which around thy heart doth wind. One impassioned—true—devoted— One whose life would hang on thee— On whom thy fancy long hath doated, Oh! mine own Beloved One—me! At once indifferent and adoring, Thou lovest me and thou lovest me not, I most blessed and most deploring, Share the happiest, heaviest lot. Mine's the weariest doom and sweetest, Strange—surpassing all things—strange— Me thou avoidest—me thou meetest— Oh! will there ne'er come a change? Yes! unconsciously thou lovest me, Mine thou art, and mine would'st be, Choosest, honourest, and approv'st me The while, thus, thus thou turn'st from me! Joy! how darkly dost thou borrow From Grief her frowns, her tears, her sighs— How dost thou—funereal Sorrow— Clasp with joy like dear allies! Tossed 'twixt happiness and anguish, 'Tis one Chaos of the Soul— I doubt, I tremble, and I languish— Oh! could I these pangs controul!— Thy love was formed to be my treasure, Which I never may possess, My troubled life is pain-in-pleasure, And agony-in-happiness! Oh! I was but for thee created, Never—never to be thine! Long hast thou in vain awaited For a feeling Soul like mine! Thine I am, thine all and only!— Thine I am not, nor may be!— Each is loveless, each is lonely, 'Tis a bitter destiny! Must we still be disunited, Must we still be Sorrow's prey, Must each gentle hope be blighted, Shall there dawn no fairer day? Shall there rise no brighter Sun, Love, Shall there spread no happier sky— Then better far to look on none, Love, Better, better far to die! Could my Spirit stand before thee, Clad in robes of Truth's own light, Thou would'st adore as I adore thee, Thou would'st see that Soul aright! Thou should'st deem not as thou deemest Thy love a lifeless love and vain— 'Tis not all a dream thou dreamest, 'Tis no vision of the brain! 'Tis no fleeting form ideal That thou thron'st within thy mind— Though for thee 'tis as unreal As the shadows none may bind. 'Tis not that thou'rt fascinated By an aëry phantasy Uncalled to being—uncreated— Known but to the dreaming eye! But so thou ever shalt be thinking, So thou ever shalt believe— And in trembling silence shrinking, I am destined to deceive! I am destined to deceive thee, (Miserable doom of mine!) Oh! that I could die and leave thee One dear Memory—half divine! Could I leave thee but in dying One deep Memory all of me— Then, farewell to grief and sighing— Oh! to die!—and live in thee! Not to be save in thy Being, Not to live save through thy life— Now, e'en now would I be fleeing From the anguish and the strife. Now, e'en now would I be leaving All the sorrows of my fate, For this weary heart is heaving Sick and faint and desolate! Morning after Morning cometh But to see my Hopes decline— For even in this heart's waste bloometh Hope—a flower that looks like thine. Poor flower! 'mid ruins hath it flourished, Storms have canopied its head, In a soil of fire 'tis nourished, Despair! thy dews are o'er it shed. A wilderness of weeds is round it, A wilderness of weeds and thorns, Plants of poisonous juice have bound it, All about it grieves and mourns!— It hath flourished, it hath faded, Faded oft to be renewed, By a Sky of gloom o'ershaded, In an angry solitude! By no gentle fosterage cherished, By no loving hand caressed, 'Twere haply better had it perished, E'er in fleeting bloom 'twas dressed. Rooted as it is in ashes, Rained on as it is by tears, Shone on but by scathing flashes, Still a tender stem it rears. Hope! though many things endear thee, Thou'rt the source of bitterest care, I have learnt, long learnt to fear thee, Lovely as thou art and fair. Didst not thou still stir within me, I perchance might grow resigned, Reflection from this World might win me, Calm repose might soothe my mind. No dear dream should I be shaping, To be wronged by Grief's sharp blight, Once from thy strong sway escaping, From thy witching power and might. Oh! of Happiness no vision Should my yearning fancy bless— (With its Heavenly smile Elysian— Soul awakening Happiness!) I should not dream of its existence, Should not of its nature know, Hope, 'tis through thy false assistance Hearts are ruined, crushed below! Sorrow, gloom, and melancholy, If ye must my Soul possess, Oh! possess it fully—wholly— Leave no dreams of Happiness. Be your empire undivided, So I yet may win repose— Not thus doubtful—undecided, Slave of struggling joys and woes. Let me, let me rest—forgetting That on Earth there lives Delight, When the Sun is sinking, setting, I would that it at once were Night! Twilight glimpses—Starry gleamings, Meteor-glimmerings of rich Light— But bring back regretful dreamings Of that Sun in all his might:— But awake a vain desiring, In his glowing smile to bask— I would gladly shrink retiring E'en beneath Night's dunnest mask! Weak, how weak this fond repining O'er a fate that nought can change— Every torturing pang refining— 'Tis a weakness dire and strange! Every racking throe increasing, Sharpening every deep-driven sting, Will this pain be never ceasing, Is it an immortal thing? Oh! is it, is it everlasting, Thought too fearful to be borne, Must it still my Soul be wasting— By conflicting feelings torn? Oh! when, Dear One, we're reposing, Snatched from this dark mortal sphere, Each to each shall be disclosing Truths 'twere well we had known here. Then no more in darkness shrouded Shall my spirit live unknown— But shall stand in light unclouded, All revealed unto thine own. No more unconsciously adoring Shalt thy weary Soul complain, Her strength on aimless Passion pouring Hopelessly and still in vain. No more unwillingly deceiving Shall I shroud my Soul from thee— But woo in joy thy strong believing, Claim thy perfect sympathy! Every suffering then were over, Every sorrow hushed to rest, Then shouldst thou be the warmest lover, And I the most beloved and blessed! Hasten! thou dear Deliverance! hasten! For I am crushed beneath my grief, The long and heavy chain unfasten, And give the o'erburthened heart relief! Oh! let the sentence now be spoken, Disperse these clouds—divide these shades, And let this tenfold gloom be broken That round me ever deepening spreads. Oh! joy beyond all thought—all dreaming, To rend the dull and envious veil, Whose hated folds have been long streaming 'Twixt us, to blight with bitterest bale— For sorrow over both is darkening, I am bowed down to the dust, To no voice of comfort hearkening, Reft of every stabler trust. And thou, Oh! thou in sooth hast emptied The most poisoned cup of pain, From no mortal pang exempted, That hath wrung my heart and brain. Her thou singlest forth and choosest, Her whom thou could'st love alone, Her thou lovest—her thou losest!— Yet she still is all thine own! Thou losest her whom most thou lovest, Her whose heart and soul are thine, Her thou laudest, hailest, approvest, Her who must neglected pine! Her thou avoid'st—thou most admirest, (Oh! black mistake! whence springs this strife) Her thou desert'st—yet most desirest, For thine own heart-linked Love in Life! Her thou lov'st with zeal unmeasured, Her for whom thou would'st have died, Her whom in thy Soul thou'st treasured, Her thou shun'st—though at thy side! Fell, foul mistake! most fatal error! Ruining two souls at once— Which each should be the other's mirror, The echo—shadow—and response! Fatal error!—dark delusion! Fatal both to thee and me, Making of our hopes confusion, And our curse our constancy. Is it to remain for ever, Shall no alteration be?— Vain the effort, vain the endeavour, Fate estrangeth thee and me! And from me, from me thou turnest, Strangers we for ever are— I pass on mourning—and thou mournest, Each is chained to one stern care. Each is hopeless—each is haunted By one dream that should be blest— I have pined and thou hast panted For a treasure long possessed! For it is so—I know, I feel it— Thou dost love me, thou'rt mine own— Though thou never may'st reveal it, Though to thee the truth's unknown! Though thou never hast suspected This sweet truth—so deep, so dear— But hast evermore neglected Her who death-doomed, droopeth near. And I love thee—Oh! 'twere folly To attempt such Love to breathe, Love thee wildly—warmly—wholly— With a passion strong as Death! Yet from me—from me thou turnest, Yet we are as strangers still— Her thou sighest for, thou spurnest, And condemn'st to deadliest ill! Thou'rt mistaken and misguided, I am still misunderstood, Thus dissevered and divided, Each doth o'er lone sorrows brood. Woe, woe is me—each hour must heighten Griefs by which I sink undone, Since I never may enlighten Thee, for whom I live alone. Since I never can awaken To the truth thy mind deceived, To the last thou 'lt be mistaken, And I abandoned and bereaved! And mine is but this consolation, 'Tis a mournful one and drear— If there lives one in Creation Born for thee—that one is here! And from me thou turn'st—and sighest, And all the while the truth may be Within thy deepest heart, thou diest, Pin'st, and mourn'st for one like me. Yes! unconsciously thou lov'st me, This I feel, and this I know, Choosest, honourest, hail'st, approv'st me, And leav'st me to a life of woe! And leav'st me to o'erwhelming sadness, Which no firmness can controul, All seems mockery—all seems madness— All is misery to my Soul! Misery—yet the grief is mingled With a proud felicity, Oh! the pride to be forth-singled Even unconsciously by thee! OH! YE WHO SUFFER. Oh! ye who suffer and who sigh! It is your fault—your folly still, From the ancient Times deep voices cry, To say this World's a World of ill! To wean you from its treacherous wiles, To warn you from its threatening ways, To bid you shun its hollow smiles, To bring you safe through its false maze! For evermore they cry “beware!” But who e'er stays to heed their cry— We little for their counsels care— And so we suffer and we sigh! Do not these warning voices say— “Not here should mortals place their trust, All here is ruin and decay, The glory of this World is dust!” Do not those prophet voices cry— “All who to Earth will hold and cling, Must learn to suffer and to sigh— For Earth is but a vain, vain thing!” What myriad myriads here have mourned, And drank the cup of sufferings sore— To warn the rest as they were warned, And vainly—vainly evermore! They went in sorrow to the grave, Because they loved this World too well— But shall this aid us, shall this save Those who where they were dwelling, dwell? No! myriads have gone mourning thus, And myriads myriads myriads shall, No warning voice delivereth us— Though from the deep of Death it call. We rush upon our certain woe— Still trusting to this faithless World— We dare the dangers that we know— And soon from Hope's gay height are hurled! Not all the tears that have been shed, Not all the sighs that have been heaved, Have e'er deterred us, still misled— Still disappointed and deceived! This mortal ground must ever prove, Despite our watching and our toil, Despite all labours of our love, As a Volcanic Island's soil. A soil where, in their gloomy bed Fierce fatal fires concealed remain— Ready Destruction's wrath to spread Around us—who have toiled in vain! The ashes of former fires are there, Of future flames the deadly germs, And vain must be our toil and care, For what are we but helpless worms? Thence ruin shall we reap alone, But whose in sooth shall be the blame? 'Tis vanity that we have sown, And 'tis our doom to reap the same! Then seem our Past and Present blent In one unchecked, unbroken gloom, And yon Imperial Firmament Shines, arched, o'er one wide yawning tomb! Then seems the angry Future too Like one dark threatening thunder-cloud Full of our fates—to blast the view, With Night, and Death, and Tempest bowed! When radiant Morning comes to throw Her beauty o'er created things, We sicken at the enchanted glow Which unto us but suffering brings! When Vesper hours are floating past With all their sweetness and their calm, We pray such hours may be our last, For they can yield our hearts no balm. We weep—but every burning tear Seems scorching up our very Souls, Making all desolate and drear— Like lava that o'er vineyards rolls! We weep—but every drop appears A quivering life-drop of the heart, A shower of fire those passionate tears, That tenfold make our torture's smart! Our Souls then writhe with agony That lay all crushed and still before, While rain down from the hopeless eye Those deadly drops—with anguish sore. The effort and the struggle then The Soul's numbed energies awake, We had sunk down—we rise again— The burthen on our hearts to take! And so we suffer and we sigh, Nor counsel we, nor caution heed— We strive on idly till we die— Our heart-strength pillared in a reed! The hollow Hopes to which we cling Just soften and unnerve the mind, Then false as falsehood's self take wing, And leave a living wreck behind! And on the withered wearied heart They stamp their blasted track and bare, Like fairy-rings—and swift depart, And all their memory is despair! Or like receding waves that fling Faint foam-wreaths on the yellow shore, Pale garlands never blossoming— That never fruit of promise bore! And so we suffer and we sigh, And grieve that we were ever born, Though from the Past deep voices cry, To give us counsel and to warn. And all that after us shall come, Like us shall murmur and shall mourn, And turn them to the sheltering tomb— And grieve that ever they were born! For still the restless heart of man Against his Earthly doom rebels— Beyond his narrow bounded span, With mighty yearning still it swells. It still will struggle and aspire— Till from all hope 'tis sternly hurled, And seek with fond and vain desire Heaven's joy in this unheavenly World! In this unheavenly World's bleak waste 'T will thirst for fountains of delight, That far above are brightly placed Where sweeps no Storm, and frowns no Night. And therefore must it burn and bound Too proudly—passionately still— With fervent feelings too profound— Until it lieth mute and chill. And therefore must it bleed and ache With overwhelming burthening cares— Till haply it is doomed to break— Victim of long-endured despairs. Yet surely better for the mind To mourn in generous discontent, Than here its perfect joy to find, Where prisoned in the clay 'tis pent. Aye! haply better still to aspire— And learn through Disappointment's power, That here the hope and the desire Must wither like Spring's first-born flower. Better to suffer and to sigh, And learn through sorrow and through shame That only, only when we die Can we the bliss unclouded claim! A SHADOW ROUND ME. A shadow round me broodeth dark, No dove abideth in mine ark, For me there is no rest, no peace, My sorrows evermore increase! I that once moved in glorious gladness, Move zoned and mantled round with sadness! I faulter on mine onward road, For heavy, heavy is my load, And none compassionately share The crushing burthen that I bear; No! those I meet in Life's mazed turnings Shrink from my murmurings and my mournings! All have their separate joy or woe, All their engrossing schemes below, And none may pause with kind delay To weep with weepers on their way— Then let me on—unsoothed, unaided, With every hope and feeling faded! My heart was like some vase of old, Which doth all precious things enfold, Whose incense makes the temple glad, Which in its golden clouds seems clad, Now 'tis a vase all crushed and shattered, Shivered its wreaths—its incense scattered. The feelings of the suffering breast May silent lie—yet not suppressed— No rest amid their ruin they May find, but shudderingly decay, Still quick and conscious in their dying— Ever to Fate's sharp strokes replying. Why must this be?—Oh! cruel Woe! Crush, crush them now with one dread blow, Nor let one beam of hope outshine To rouse them in their dull decline, Who from the Grave would rise, contented To be upon the rack tormented? For, Oh! that beam—if beam there be, Glimpsing through long despondency, With fierce suspense would soon consume The Soul long wrapt in shrouding gloom— And show the spoils and the undoings— Th' ashes—the wrecks—the fragment-strewings! Why for the roc must we still pine, Why must the distant seem divine, Why must the difficult appear The most desirable and dear? 'Tis thus we live in doubt for ever, Existence but one restless fever. Still we desire what is denied, And turn from blessings known and tried, Too oft with senseless wishes fond, To grasp at something far beyond— Something that hath not yet been ours, And so we strive with misspent powers. But Love! immortal Love! may'st thou Be the angel of my healings now, Thou, thou, the Flower—the Star—the Gem— The Light—the Crown—the Spring—the Stem From which all lovely joys rise brightly, To bid us climb Life's rough steeps lightly. Thou gentle and Earth-gladdening Power! Of every garland—crowning flower, Fair Sovereign planet of all skies— Harmony of all Harmonies— Art thou confessed in sooth for ever, Ne'er shall my hand thy bright chain sever! Still, still be mine—nay! still be me, For all my Soul is full of thee!— And did I in my sorrow say I would fain 'scape from Feeling's sway, Who would not bear the woes of Feeling, To know the rapture of their healing? For surely none for ever mourn!— None are through Life's whole course forlorn— Relenting Fate doth bring at last Some consolation for the Past— The drought declineth—dew descendeth— Ebbeth the surge—the wild storm endeth! And yet of Hope I am afraid, Oh! wrap me in gloom's thickest shade Sooner than give the uncertain light Which shows the threatening depths of Night— The light that quickly fadeth—waneth— But for a while its cheer retaineth. TO ?. [And hath time gone with thee right well] And hath time gone with thee right well, Gentle Friend of mine—Oh! tell, Have the years—the months—the days Sped lightly on their 'missioned ways? Whether on that lovely shore We together trod of yore, By that blue and balmy Bay Where the Syren wont to stay, By that Sun-bright, Sky-like Sea, Purpling round Parthenope! With its clustering islands bright, Little rosy Worlds of Light— Worlds within the World—apart— Warmed at the great Sun's deep heart, Orphans of Creation wide, Cast away on the outstretched tide! Or whether 'midst those ancient Halls, (Those ruined Towers, those crumbling Walls) Where that Imperial City old Sad but glorious to behold, Standeth in her Seven-hill'd Pride, She that long a World defied! Where now Time's deepest shadow falls, That Capital of Capitals! Or whether where luxuriant bowers, Screens for Summer's sultriest hours, In the glorious bloom expand, Making Earth a Fairy-land!— 'Mid the haunts where rose and vine At the green base of the Appennine Beautify the scene around, Or where the Alps the prospect bound, And with their deep eternal snows Dwell in a dazzling cold repose, Have the Hours—the Months—the Years— (Oft so dimmed with doubts and fears) Sped well with thee—dear friend of mine, And laughed with joy's clear Summer-shine? Flowers around thee have they shed? Have they brightly lightly sped— Have they o'er thee sweetly cast Fair dreams that shall themselves outlast? Have they brought thee treasures rare, That shall be for ever fair, Such as in the Spirit shrined Must enrich the heart and mind, Treasures not of mortal birth, Not of this unsteadfast Earth? Have they these on thee bestowed, As they smoothly onwards flowed, Have the Months—the Days—the Hours Given thee such triumphant dowers?— Have they thus presented thee With riches of Eternity? Oh! may they do thus, dear Friend, Ever—ever—to the end! Still may the Hours—the Months—the Days, Which find thee in Life's wildering maze, Bequeathe thee on their passage calm— Dreams of bliss—and dews of balm, Hopes that leave this world behind, Strong as light, and free as wind, Pure and deep expectancies Like the Stars fixed in the Skies— Heart-Beatitudes—that dwell In the bosom's deepest cell, Precious shadowings forth of those That await Life's peaceful close, That all gloomily await The final crowning act of Fate— When the Life hath blameless been, Through every stage and every scene! Yea! may the Hours—the Months—the Days, Lit by ever-brightening rays, Holy, high, and happy things, Waft thee on their golden wings— Until at length they brightly be Melted in the Eternity, Where the Days and where the Hours See no fading of joy's flowers— No drying up of Love's rich streams, No waning of bright triumph's beams— Where the Hours and where the Days Roll on in one deep Sunny blaze, Brightening on their glorious flight, Where shall be no cloud—no Night, Days—of ages length sublime, Nay! mocking the whole course of time, Hours, whose shining circles be Each an Immortality! Days—and Hours—and Months—and Years, Known to human hopes and fears!— Even as we use these below, In their strong and silent flow— Shall we those enjoy above. Which in one bright tenour move, Changeless, ceaseless, constant, clear, Passing not, as they do here, But accumulating still— Without taint or touch of ill, Without variance or decay, Hour with hour—and day in day! Without division—without pause, This comes on—nor that withdraws! Sun to Sun—and Light to Light, All commingling there unite— All at once are traced and told, All at once we have and hold, All combine and all still blend In those ages without end! Moments there mock centuried years, 'Mid the deathless changeless spheres, Wide Milleniums seem as nought To the Eternity of Thought. May thy Days—thy Months—thine Hours, Gentle Friend, while yet 'mid bowers Of Earth thou art constrained to dwell, Ever fairly speed and well! May they as they onwards flow, Marked and measured out below, As they onwards flow and roll, Bring glad tidings to thy Soul, While Life's wonderous web they weave, From them may'st thou still receive Happy gifts, of price beyond All Fancy's dreamings wild and fond, Out of these may richly grow While they calmly clearly flow, Without suffering, wrong, or strife, To make up thine Earthly Life— Bright and blessed Eternities Shining in the orbèd Skies— Ah! moment still by moment must Be taken as a solemn trust, If we would have the hours and days While the Pulse of Life yet plays, Brightened with the smiles of bliss, Even in such a World as this; Moments, Hours, Days, Months, and Years, Waves through which our swift bark steers, Speeding, speeding evermore To the All-receiving shore, Should be on their rapid course, (Sped with unabating force) Prized by us as we should prize Embassies from the opening Skies, As we use them or abuse, As they good or ill produce, We shall triumph or shall mourn, When Life's fragile thread is torn, We must with unwearying care (Nor toil, nor watch, nor labour spare) To one great task ourselves devote As adown the stream we float, To one great task ourselves apply For we only live to die— For to us our time is given By the o'erruling Power of Heaven— Only that with it we may Hour by hour—and day by day Brightly purchase—nobly buy The treasures of the Eternity! Circling hours—how still, how mute Ye just touch with silvery foot This dim dull Earth, and then away To the far off climes of day— Bearing a momentous weight Still of human acts and fate, Big with awful secrets stern, Which the Universe shall learn, On that deep and dreadful Morn When the dead shall rise new born, Through Eternity to know The worth of passing time below, Oh! to those I love may ye Come like angels smilingly, Bearing unto them indeed Messages from Heaven, to lead Their faultering footsteps in the path Which is free from gloom and wrath— Charged with precious secrets deep For them in their hearts to keep— Ever whispering as ye pass, Swift as the shadows o'er a glass— “In ourselves we brief may seem As the visions of a dream— But Heaven's Daughters!—we shall be Mothers of the Eternity! Lo! from us shall yet descend Times and Ages without end— Cherish us on our swift flight, Still, if precious in your sight Everlasting Life can be— We—Mothers of the Eternity!” OH! I HAVE MANY DREAMS. Oh! I have many Dreams— A fair World all mine own— In the woods—and by the streams— Nor then am I alone. But in the battling crowd No dreams do bless my thought, The World's I am avowed, And in its toils am caught! Imagination's Slave Is Lord of all around, But cramped as in the Grave Is he the World hath bound! Oh! give me back my dreams, Give back Earth, Air, and Heaven, Stars, flowers, gales, clouds, and streams, Free from the World's dull leaven. Then can I coin the Sun To a treasure all mine own, Nor reck he shines upon Thronged Worlds—mine—mine alone! Then, those thronged Worlds can I Make mine too as I list, In Man's vain sphere I die, In Nature's sphere exist! Then let me still avoid Mixed crowds—by weak minds sought, There sink—o'erborne—destroyed— The Feeling and the Thought! STANZAS [Hope! Hope! I dreamed I had exiled thee] Hope! Hope! I dreamed I had exiled thee, And all thy flattering Circe train. “Begone!” I cried, then calm and free, I shall forget my bosomed pain. And Peace—the Halcyon of the Soul Shall surely so be gently won, (When its wild waves forbear to roll) To rest its lulled, smooth streams upon! Then shall my feelings grow so calm In their subdued and silenced flow, That softest Quiet's honeyed balm Shall soothe away all weary woe! Hope—thus I pondered—weak and blind! A sweet voice echoed every word, Alas! it did not strike my mind That still 't was thy voice that I heard. I pondered thus and planned—and caught Thy while thy softest loveliest beam, Alas! it did not strike my thought That thou didst still prompt every dream. And thou 'rt as likely to depart And leave my Soul once more forlorn, And break on this slight wheel—my heart As though on haughtiest dreams 't was borne. Then if I must thy victim fall, Clasp round me all thy radiant chains, Oh! let me share the pleasures all, If I must bear and brook the pains! Still—whether in the Future time We look for Happiness or Peace— Seeking to Joy's sunned heights to climb, Or asking but that pangs should cease— Whether we weave bright schemes and blest, Or wait till Death wipes every tear— Sighing for rapture—or for rest, 'T is thy voice—thy voice that we hear! And long suspense—or feverish strife— May be our portion and our part— These make an agony of Life— These make a ruin of the heart. Here—Disappointment's strokes descend, There—Death himself seems to recede, When he should come all griefs to end, How oft he leaves the heart to bleed! How oft he leaves the heart to ache, When he should come to hush its pain, While hearts hope-winged he speeds to o'ertake, And binds them in his frozen chain! Oh! Hope! all thought of future days Would I now willingly resign— Nor seek with fond onlooking gaze To make that hidden future mine! But if thou wilt with strange stealth glide Into the deep heart's chambers lone, With human nature's self allied— Then—then, Oh! Hope! be all mine own! Thus, if I must thy victim fall— Wreathe round me all thy richest chains, Oh! let me snatch the pleasures all If I indeed must share—the pains! WHEN MY NAME. When my name 'mongst ye is heard, Still couple it with some kind word, Let it ever spoken be In gentlest tone of sympathy, Be it evermore allied (Though not with sighs accompanied) To soft expressions of regret— But if ye cease to love—forget! If absence from your hearts remove me, Oh! if, sweet friends! you cease to love me, If absence cloud with such eclipse, Let not my name then pass your lips, Not on your lips, friends! would I dwell, If banished from your bosom's cell— Oh! breathe my name with kind regret, Or if you cease to love—forget! That name should call up many a thought From Memory's treasure-houses brought, Full, full of sweetness and of power, And strong to charm the passing hour, Ah! many a thought of vanished things Flown on Time's own sweeping wings, Should it bring to ye—sweet Friends! If absence not, Love's pure tie rends, When my name is spoken, then Let it bring to mind again Scenes and joys now past away, Things of a departed day! Hours when its loved sound appeared, (By many mutual ties endeared,) Ever welcome—ever blest— With its echo in the breast! Oh! that sound did mingle still (At the thought these dim eyes fill With vainest tears—whose fevered flow Speaks but cannot soothe my woe) With all sounds of mirth and glee, All glad sounds of festivity, These it mingled with, ere yet My Soul's bright light of bliss was set! When my name 'mongst ye is breathed, Let, Oh! let it then be wreathed With many a Story of the Past, O'er which, like a bright spell cast, Its utterance shall the glow of truth Strongly shed—till love and ruth Moisten your kind eyes for me, Knowing the Infelicity That still my fainting steps attends, Thus borne from ye! my Friends! my Friends! Stranger-Friends that must be now, Severed—sundered here below— Parted—parted—weary word, Thrilling Memory's every chord— Stranger-Friends?—Oh! mocking Fate, Thou mak'st my sick heart desolate. What is Life—when lost, lost love Hastens back to his home above— Leaving but a rich regret, Like brooding light from fair Suns set? Stranger-Friends?—whose thoughts no more Together mingle as before— Whose feelings now are torn apart— Soul from soul—and heart from heart— Ye may weep, my Friends! the while All unconsciously I smile; I may mourn, while full of mirth, On this strange this changeful Earth, Ye may laugh the time away, Basking in joy's cloudless ray! Stranger-Friends!—Oh! must this be Bitter, blighting thought to me! Stranger-Friends!—that nothing know Of mutual weal or mutual woe? Every hallowed tie undone, Feeling's finest fervours gone— Sympathies destroyed and chilled, Love's spiritual music stilled? No! this shall not be—not thus— I pray, may Fate dissever us— Love shall still our hearts controul, Love shall still twine Soul with Soul— Distance—changes—absence—vain Shall be to wrest from him his reign— And, Oh! so long, so long as Love Moveth still where'er we move, So long hath he, retaineth still Power to make one heart-pulse thrill, Despite of distance then and doom We may not Stranger-Friends become. No! we shall yet be true, unchanged, With faith and feelings unestranged, Though ignorant we yet may be, Each of the other's destiny, Not, not of the outward common lot— How often that affecteth not The inward conditions of the Soul, Soaring beyond its blind controul! (Within itself empowered to make Its peace and weal—which seldom shake, Mere accidents of circumstance, If armed to meet each mortal chance With steadfast purpose and unbent, And fixed and will-enforced content— It hold its high and certain way, Enpanoplied with mailed array, Girt round with strength, from noblest source, A mighty and a moveless force—) The outward lot may all be known Perchance—but that which is not shown When absence separates those who love, And far doth faithful hearts remove, Is the inward Spirit's Mystery Of joy or grief—which bared may be To Friendship's eye, in converse dear From time to time, perchance even here In moments when the heart reveals Those secrets it so oft conceals— Not all by words, but signs—but hints Fleeting and fine as rainbow-tints, Which yet the instinctive sense of love Is quick to catch and to improve! And so the hidden truth is shown, And so the secret Soul is known. Sweet Friends! lost Friends! Oh! love me still— My true heart whispers aye—ye will! And be my name amongst ye heard, An every-day familiar word, And keep for me a precious part Within each fond and feeling heart, Think of me still, with Love's regret, Or—if you cease to love—forget! HOPE! HADST THOU FLOWN AWAY. Hope! hadst thou flown away, That I had borne!— But, touched with Earth's decay, Thou liest forlorn— Mortal-like—Dream of Dreams! Thus canst thou be?— Cold, cold corruption seems Busy with thee! Hope! hadst thou flown away, That I had borne! But not thus day by day Thy wane to mourn! Thy wane to watch, and weep— And my Life's waste— Oh! long and dreamless sleep— Haste—pitying—haste! Hope! or at once depart— Or but revive— Cease, cease to haunt this heart, Or—brightly live! Death hath been done on thee, This Heart's thy tomb! There, there thy reliques be, Dark desperate doom! Not like things living found In the dead rock, Thee, living pulses bound, Sternly to mock! While thou liest mute and chill, Lifeless and lone, Silent and stark and still, Senseless as stone! Oh! that thy living grave Even my sick heart Fate would from tortures save— Made what thou art! Oh! that thy living grave— My crushed, crushed heart Lethe's dear wave might lave— Made what thou art! Hope! hadst thou flown away, That I had borne! But, touched with Earth's decay, Thou liest forlorn! I cannot all despair Sorrowing apart, While thy fair dust is there, Even at my heart! There lie thy sweet remains, Still to remind How once I bore thy chains Trustful and blind! I cannot all despair— Born still to aspire— Oh! wherefore are ye fair, Dreams, dreams of fire? Wherefore do these still rise O'er breast and brain, Lending—while joy still flies— New powers to pain? STANZAS. [I am a withered leaf] I am a withered leaf Spring's glorious pomps among, A heavy note of grief In Life's resounding song. I am a shadowy cloud On Nature's smiling sky, Where rosy splendours crowd, Where Morn's bright footsteps fly! I am a loosened chord In Earth's great living lyre, Unrecked of—undeplored— Whose tones no more aspire! A ruined tower forlorn, 'Midst the city's palaced pride: Ah! wherefore was I born? Or, why have I not died? Peace—peace, presumptuous heart! Endure in silence here, Not always may thy part Be anguish, doubt, and fear. Happy among the bless'd, And chainless 'mid the free; In the worlds of perfect rest, May'st thou yet deeply be! SORROW. Sorrow!—traduced and injured power, They know thee not who little know— Who with thee pass a fleeting hour, Then deem they are conversant with Woe! Thou dost unlock thy precious store But for those hearts that lean to thee, That bow not only—but adore And worship thy rich Mystery! They claim a more exalted share, Sorrow! in all thou dost impose, And precious grows their gentle care, And sweet and sacred seem their woes. The only flowers they deign to cull, Are everlastings, pure, and fair, All deeply, strangely beautiful, And but their solemn bloom they wear. The only gems they deign to glean, Are pearls of price, untold, sublime; Glorious, even in this earthly scene, More glorious—where is no more Time! For them, indeed, o'ershadowing Earth, A midnight of dread shadows frowns, But then for them, sent beaming forth, A host of worlds the darkness crowns. Worlds—never shining in the day Of proud Prosperity elate— But hoarding many a Heavenly ray For the hours of Night-like Sorrow's state! For Sorrow, with her shadowy mien, She hath a proud state for her own, And Sorrow is a sceptered Queen, Whose kingdom shall not be o'erthrown. Her silent court is the inmost heart, When all submits unto her law; She rules each conscious pulse and part, Which yields with an adoring awe. The mind is queenly Sorrow's mint, And every rich thought issued thence Is stamped with her peculiar print— And, Oh!—how vast her opulence! The mind is queenly Sorrow's mint, And there each wakening thought receives Her stamp of proof—her seal and print— Which still on each she strongly leaves. Oh! Sorrow!—wronged and injured Power! How little of thy charm they know, Who pass with thee one fleeting hour, Then deem they're conversant with woe. Thou dost unlock thy precious store Only for hearts that well obey— That not alone obey—adore— And worship thee, and love thy sway! Sorrow!—thy votary true am I— I own thee fair—I call thee dear— Content to be thy votary— But only now—but only here! In this strange changeful World, in this I am content thy yoke to bear, Awaiting an eternal bliss, In Worlds more pure, more blest, more fair. Upon my fond grief of to-day, 'Midst all the sufferings of my doom Rests—charming every fear away, The shadow of the joy to come! The Sun-like Shadow, more than bright, Crowning the darkness of my life— How shines Heaven's soft reflected light On Time's black boiling surge of strife. And thus thine every pang is dear, And promises a future bliss; And lit with love falls every tear, While Sorrow's hallowed rod I kiss. I can, in this my doubled life, Glean deep content from doubt's distress; Peace—perfect peace from pain and strife, And rapture from my wretchedness! Sorrow!—traduced and injured Power, They know thee not who little know, Who pass with thee one fleeting hour, Then dream they sound the depths of woe. Thou dost display thy wond'rous store For those who well obey thy rule, Who thee exalt—and thee adore— Who study in thy mystic school! Thou show'st them in thy soul-set glass The pomps and glories of the Earth— And how they pale—and how they pass Of false, false weight, and fleeting worth. Thou show'st them that which is alone Our hope, our trust, and our defence, Oh! who hath known thee and not known To draw their deep support from thence. Thou through thy paths of winding Gloom Dost to that Rock of Ages lead! Beyond vain time—beyond the tomb, Thou bidd'st us urge our hopes indeed. Sorrow! thy Votaries love thee still, Those Votaries, who thy secrets know, Whose dark brimmed cup thy cold hands fill, Whose fate thou only rul'st below. Their hearts become thy silent court Where thou dost undisputed reign, Where Earth-born dreams may ne'er resort, Nor aught of varying and of vain. Their minds are queenly Sorrow's mint, Where every rich and solemn thought Is stamped with her peculiar print, And with them Worlds shall yet be bought. Their minds are Sorrow's rich mints still, And their pure thoughts are as fine gold: She coins these thoughts with careful skill, And makes their worth—unweighed, untold. In her dread furnace, is that Mind Seven times refined—even thought by thought, Feeling by feeling—proved—refined, Till to perfection's fulness brought. Sorrow! traduced and injured Power, They know thee not who little know— Who pass with thee one fleeting hour, Then deem they are conversant with woe! THE HUMAN HERITAGE. Mortals! where'er may be your birth On this sublimely-featured Earth— Where'er your place—whate'er your clime, Whate'er your station and your time, Whate'er your path—whate'er your Fate, Whate'er your semblance and your state, Whate'er the changes of your doom, Children of gladness or of gloom, One mighty Heritage is yours, Long as the dædal World endures; The liberal air, the open skies, Nature and her crowned mysteries. The glorious Sun, whose piercing rays Set the great Firmament ablaze; Who Worlds of Beauty overflows With splendour from his strength that grows. The pure and peaceful Moon that flings A charm o'er all terrestrial things, And rules the rude uproarious tide, From shore to shore—from side to side; And those proud tides, the strong and bold, And woods of green, and clouds of gold— And dews of pearl, and flowers of light, And change of seasons in their flight; And those on-rolling winged hours (Which each its forerunners devours;) And all Man's eye hath ever known, And all that Nature names her own: These, these, through every circling age, Mortals! must be your Heritage! A glorious Heritage and proud, Though prized not by the thoughtless crowd, Who turn too oft from all they have— The distant and the unknown to crave: Mortals, through every varying age, This is your Human Heritage. Whate'er your trials and your pains, Whate'er your blessings and your banes; Whate'er your clime—whate'er your birth, For you is Nature and the Earth! But Mortals—Mortals, ye have still, Despite of wrath, and wrong, and ill, Despite the brevity of life, Its rough rude discord and its strife— Where'er your path—where'er your place— Whate'er your rank—whate'er your race— Whate'er your country and your age, A loftier, lovelier Heritage, If ye but take the appointed means, And lean, as Faith in meekness leans, On one unchanging Rock above, A Rock of Truth, and Peace, and Love; Then, then your Heritage shall be The deep of all Eternity— Eternity's undying years, The glories of the all-glorious Spheres; The mansions whose foundations be Fixed in the Great Infinity. And yet a Heritage more proud, Whose worth no lip hath e'er avowed, Beyond all thoughts, beyond all dreams, Surpassing wholly all that seems Most mighty to exalt and bless, All extacies of Happiness, All deep Beatitudes of bliss, A wond'rous Heritage is this! The Presence of the Almighty Lord, The High, the Holy, and the Adored; The Presence of the Almighty King, Whose glory countless Angels sing For ever, with untiring love, In the transcendant realms above. The Presence of the Almighty Sire, Lifting the Spirit high and higher, Through grades of Glory and of Joy, That cannot cease—that cannot cloy. Oh! what a Heritage is this, Enriched with a stupendous Bliss; Yet such shall be all, all your own, If here ye kneel before His throne, With faith, and zeal, and lowly trust, Bowed, meekly bowed unto the dust, With consciousness of sin and shame, And calling on the one blest Name Which only can exalt and save, And guard from Ruin and the Grave. Oh! what a Heritage is this, Crown'd, crown'd with a stupendous Bliss. The Presence of the Almighty Lord, If we have served—believed, adored, Man! cease the war of care to wage, Thou hast a glorious Heritage! There is your heritage—Oh! Man! Though here your life is but a span— Gone like the shadow of a dream, The moment's ripple in the stream; The quivering dew drops on the flower, The cloud that lives one little hour, Then melts for ever from the sky: Even so, do Mortals pass and die. But, Oh! if just, and meek, and sage, How glorious is their Heritage! Not one that shall depart—decay, The good and blessing of a day, But one that everlastingly Shall gladden those who shall not die. Oh! joy beyond all joys supreme, Of which we here can only dream! Oh! mighty Happiness august, Unglimpsed, unguessed, in Earth's poor dust! Oh! mystery of Beatitude!— By clay-bound Souls not understood, The Presence of the Almighty Lord, The Highest—Holiest—All adored! The Presence of the Almighty King, With whose just praise the broad Heav'ns ring, The Presence of the Eternal Sire, That Presence which shall all inspire With joy that hath no name, no sign, Boundless, Immortal, and Divine— And not in agony of awe Within itself shall then withdraw The Soul, confounded and amazed— But purified, sublimed, and raised, It shall be strengthened to endure— (Rendered through Heavenly aid secure) That more than Sinai Presence then, Whose shadow should destroy all men— And Nature's trembling self destroy— Then shall it shed around but joy! Yet, Oh! what joy! intense, profound, Without a check without a bound— In sooth too mighty to be borne, Were not the impervious armour worn— Which girds and guards the Host of Heaven By Him who gives their Being, given! Mortals! and can ye turn away, In Life's uncertain cloud-crossed day, From such a promised joy as this— A mystery of stupendous Bliss? And such a birthright's wealth divine, Can ye, Oh! can ye e'er resign For aught that Earth has to bestow, Whose joy still darkens into woe? Oh! what a deadly enemy Must Man's fierce adversary be! Oh! what an enemy must Man Have to encounter in Life's span, That thus can mock him—thus delude— Thus in his Soul create a feud Of evil, vanity, and strife, To shut him from Eternal Life— That thus can tempt him—thus can thrust From Heights of Hope, to depths of dust, That thus can wrong him and deceive, And ruin, crush him, and bereave!— And how should he with sleepless care Make his whole Life one pauseless Prayer, One Vigil, and one Service true— That this stern Foe that doth pursue— With deadly hate and malice strong, May fail to inflict the enormous wrong, And lifted from the entangling dust, Make one high name his mighty trust, His staff through Life's rough steepy path, His shield through all its strife and wrath, His Sun—to pierce its frowning Dark— His Rock, his Guide, his Helm, his Ark! A THOUGHT. Oh! th' unstilled Heaven-and-Hell o' the Human Heart! Though marked not, weighed not, singly and apart— Doth not the Earth's Universal History teach— Even through the unrest of all—the unrest of each? HAVE I NOT LOVED THEE? Have I not loved thee?—Answer thou, Who hast beheld my changing brow, Mine altering cheek and varying eye, Whenever thou wert passing by. Have I not loved thee?—Tell me thou! Thou hast seen my crimsoning blush avow More passion than my heart could bear, Without disquiet—and despair! Thou hast seen my downcast eye express Devotion's wild and warm excess More than can dwell indeed within The Soul, without Shame, Strife, and Sin. Oh! not thus, on an idol here Should we pour all our hope and fear, Not thus should we our spirits bow Before a thing created now. Have I not loved thee?—Speak—Oh! speak! Thou hast seen the heart-hues in my cheek Paint more love than the heart can feel, And to itself the Truth reveal! So occupied I still have been With only thee through Life's mixed Scene, Oh! I have had no skill—no art— To examine mine own secret heart, No leisure time to study there, And, Oh! no Consciousness to spare; My Life knows one dear thought alone, How can my heart e'er sound that one? Like walls of blazing adamant Thy bright looks gird me—till I pant To be one little moment free— To frame one thought that is not thee. I am encompassed by thy smiles, Fettered within their golden toils— Oh! I would be one moment free, To dream one dream that is not thee. Have I not loved thee?—tell me, thou, Do I not wildly love thee now?— Is not my true Heart all thine own? Methinks to thee the truth is known. To me then that deep truth reveal, Paint to me, dearest, all I feel; Be thou my voice—thus let me hear The truth I love so much—yet fear! But be thou very eloquent!— Sweet sorcery to thy tongue be lent!— While thou unfold'st my state to me, Oh! may it touch and soften thee! Enlarge on all my passionate woes, The emotions of my Soul disclose— With just emphatic words express My feeling's fervours of excess! No anxious trembling thought withhold, All secrets of my Soul unfold— Tell me the history of my Heart, E'en pulse by pulse—and part by part. For thou canst teach me this and tell— Thou know'st that Heart's wild history well, My thoughts and dreams to thee are known, And unto thee revealed alone. My fervent zeal—my fond, fond care, To me disclose—to me declare— To me confirm—to me confess— My heart-devotion's rich distress. Sound every spring—strike every chord Of feeling, by some well weighed word— Be every mood of passion shown By some attuned accordant tone! To thee be Inspiration lent— Oh! be thou very eloquent!— Quick Feeling's deepest Soul respire, And be thy words as words of fire. Speak as the impassioned Sappho sung! Enchantment hang upon thy tongue! Tell me, and tell me o'er and o'er, Of Love that ne'er was felt before! Fair fall thine accents, breathing nought But the high wrought exstacy of thought— Oh! mighty may they be to move, And melt thine own charmed mind to love! Aye! deeply unto me reveal All I have felt and all I feel— And, Oh! sweet hope—all hopes above— Learn—learn at last thyself to love! Let thine own eloquence subdue, Let the soft tale be doubly true, Breathe mine in such a feeling tone That it may thus become thine own! Be witchery poured on every word, The sweetest sounds ear ever heard— So that thine heart they thus may move, And teach thee tenderness and love! Have I not loved thee?—Answer then, Oh! tell me o'er and o'er again! Have I not loved thee?—Answer thou— Do I not love thee wildly now? Thou one dear Being of my choice, I have no words—no witching voice Wherewith to make my passion known, But I will win thee with thine own. The love which thou shalt paint so well, On which thou shalt so deeply dwell, Shall wake an answering Love in thee, So shalt thou win thyself for me! Have I not loved thee?—Tell me then, And tell me o'er and o'er again, Do I not love thee fondly now, And wilt thou love me?—Answer thou! NOW WOULD I PLUNGE MY SOUL. Now would I plunge my Soul and Mind, In reckless desperation blind, In the last depth of worst despair, And leap in Grief's dark tiger-lair. Now would I shuddering shrink away, And shun the ills that day by day Are crowding round my shadowy path, All rough with terrors and with wrath! Do any thing but meet and bear With Mind unbent, the Storms of care, With steadfast Soul and governed Will Antagonizing the adverse ill! Do any thing but meet and bear The griefs allotted to my share, With meekness still, and patience sweet, As the Heirs of Heavenly grace should meet! Do any thing but bear my doom With firmness that must best become Heaven's soldiers militant below, Who pierce their way through clouds of woe. Who wait, in firm fixed hope, to hail Beyond this misty, shadowy vale, Their high reward—their mighty meed, In worlds of joy and peace indeed! Who should, till that fair field as won, Buckle the immortal armour on Of faith, and zeal, and trustful Love, And lift Hope's kindling eyes above! Nor from the allotted struggles shrink, Nor madly seek the fatal brink, Nor put the bitter cup away, Nor yield themselves Despair's weak prey. Oh! I have ill endured and borne— And now my grievous fault I mourn; Yet lack the strength which pure minds share, That fault to amend and to repair. Weak, weak am I—as reeds are weak, And now in reckless mood I seek The extremity of dark Despair, Now shun the lightest shock of care. Now would I seek the shades of Death, And fling myself unawed beneath Adversity's destructive wheels, And dread the touch that binds and heals. And now would I even thrust aside, With weak Dismay or stubborn Pride, The memory of the woe which wrings My heart with poisoned poisoned stings! Oh! that I may at length be taught To regulate each restless thought, To temper, moderate, and controul These changeful workings of my Soul! Oh! that I could be taught at last, To bide harsh Fortune's bitterest blast With resignation firm and meek— Nor vainly bold—nor vilely weak. Oh! that I could be taught at length To arm my Soul with solemn strength, To win a sacred fortitude 'Stead of this ever varying mood. Then were I bless'd—how deeply bless'd— With pauseless peace and rackless rest, And with serene endurance mailed, 'Gainst ills that long have man assailed. Then were I bless'd—how nobly bless'd— Of high and fearless strength possess'd, And learning deeply evermore To breast the storms I feared before. But not through mine own might can I Thus gird myself with Victory; No! I must look for aid above, And trust to Heavenly grace and love. Alone through that Almighty Aid, Can weary tremblers, long afraid, Be taught at last to cast away The burthen of their Soul's dismay. WHEN I MEET. When I meet those deep, deep eyes, My very Soul then seems expiring; 'Tis too much of a faint surprise That should be all intense, admiring. Yes! my Soul within me dies, Or suffers some dread change o'erpowering, When from those distracting eyes, Fate, and Love, and Life seem showering. I am thine—all, only thine— I can 'scape this thraldom never; My tranced thoughts—they are not mine— Stamped but with thine Image ever! I am thine, and thine alone, As thou wilt with me thou dealest, Yet no mercy hast thou shown, 'Tis my ruin still thou sealest. When I meet those deep, deep eyes My very Soul then seems expiring, Tranced and motionless it lies In its secret self retiring. Yes! my Soul within me dies, Or suffers some stern change o'erpowering, When I meet those matchless eyes— Oh! it sinks crushed down and cowering. But no mercy doth it meet, Though it yields thus unresisting— Spurned—though falling at thy feet, Only in thy breath existing. If I loved thee half as much, I might hope to melt—to move thee, Then might I thy feelings touch, But too fearfully I love thee. What have I to offer thee? A Soul where but one thought is reigning, 'Tis a blank monotony, And deserves but such disdaining! OH! FOR INDIFFERENCE. Oh! for Indifference for awhile, To learn thy dazzling looks by heart, To study each o'erpowering smile, And perfect make my Lover's part! So much—so madly much I love, I know—I feel—I ofttimes fail— Where Admiration most should move And view thee through a mist-like Veil! With over-gazing am I blind, Fettered in an oppressive chain, And faint dreams darken o'er my mind, And weary thoughts distress my brain. Whene'er I am away from thee Scarce one remembered look remains On which to feed Idolatry, And fan the fires of joys and pains. Confused, bewildered, and amazed While thou wert near, I still remained, Had the great Sun before me blazed, Scarce had it more distress'd and pained. And all remembrances of Thee Are crossed and clouded in my Soul— Must I for ever darkly be Bound in so crushing a controul? Oh! for Indifference but to find The unnumbered charms that others do, In thy transcendant Mien and Mind, Charms every varying—ever new. Unnumbered new perfections they Observe in thee for evermore, Who not the o'er zealous homage pay, Which they pay who too much adore. I prized those dear perfections so, Which first I found and blessed in thee; I marked not how from these did grow An ever rich variety. Thou to thy own great witcheries thus Hast blinded me, who, from the first, With awe-touched love, and tremulous, Thy graces and thy charms rehearsed. Oh! for Indifference, but to find Those thousand charms that others do, In thy so matchless Mien and Mind, Ever increasing—ever new! I know, I know I do thee wrong, Who love thee more than all beside, Charms without end to thee belong, Which my rapt Mind hath ne'er descried! I know that thus I wrong thee still, Myself, too, wronged by Love's excess! And have not the art, and have no skill To make that haunting passion less! I am like one who fired with zeal, Kneels by the Ganges' sacred stream; One who in speechless trance doth kneel, Wrapt in some deep adoring dream. The glorious River onward flows, Clothed in its gold and azure pride; He little of its proud course knows, Kneeling, as spell bound, by its side. The glorious River onwards flows, And wins new splendours on its way, Its proud variety still shows, And changes oft its rich array. It onwards rolls in power and pride, And lovelier seems to grow the while, The cloudless skies bedeck the tide With many a sparkle—many a smile. The beauteous River onwards flows, And doth its stated path fulfil, And gains and gathers, as it goes, More beauty and more triumph still. It maketh glad the verdant shore, Gleaming in azure and in gold, And gains and gathers evermore More pomp, more pride, an hundred-fold! Luxuriant kindlings—orient stains, Bright picturings of the shore and sky, Fair dimplings—dazzling sparkle-trains, Its onward course diversify. Here the crisped waves, all rose-touched shine— There blazed with burning gold they glide— Even like some moving molten mine Appears the lustrous lucid tide. Here, fringed on either side with flowers The waters wind, and blushing play; There many a tree majestic towers, And statelier growths adorn their way. But that rapt worshipper the while His station keeps, and nothing knows Of glancing gleam, and sparkling smile, Whose beauty breaks the tide's repose. He sees, but from one point of view, The mighty River's rolling pride, Hailed—honoured 'tis, with homage true, But half its wealth is not descried. With homage true 'tis blessed and hailed, Sped on its swift and shining flow, But the eye entranced, engrossed, hath failed To mark its glory's varying show. To mark its still increasing boast Of splendours and of triumphs new, How much is overlooked and lost In Adoration's partial view. And, like that Worshipper, I bring To thee the homage of my heart, How well—how wildly worshipping, Yet but a portion and a part! For, like that Worshipper, I kneel, Wrapt in too fond and fixed a dream, Wound up to such a pitch of zeal, That my whole Soul absorbed might seem. I saw thee in thy wondrous pride Of Nature's gifts, and graces move, And then that Soul within me died One costly sacrifice of love. I saw thee with a matchless store Of rich perfections, pure and bright, And knew and needed them no more, With raptured heart and ravished sight. But from perfection evermore Dost thou to new perfection move, Thy Soul at once was taught to adore, It cannot rise from love to love! It might not follow thy proud flight, (Even though an angel's wings it wore,) It reached at once Devotion's height, How can it farther mount and soar? And then, in rapture's deepest trance, There stood it still, to pour forth all Those fervent feelings which, perchance, Were weakened by so strict a thrall! Then stood it still in rapture's trance, While thon, deserving more its zeal, Didst brightly, gloriously advance, New charms for ever to reveal! But not unto the dazzled view Of those with breathless Soul o'erwrought, To thy past charms too deeply true, To adore thy present as they ought. The image stamped upon my Soul— Doth now but represent a part Of that transcendant, perfect whole, Which claims the love of every heart! But on that image I have gazed Till I am blind to all beside, And watched and worshipped, prized and praised, Till all but that, for me, hath died! Forgive me, that I thus must fail To render thee thy rightful due, The barque obeys the on-speeding gale, The trembling needle must be true! It cannot change—it never gains From winds or waves, that varying pass, A different impulse—but remains For ever what at first it was! No deeper homage can it show Unto that star it doth adore, Howe'er that star's soft rays may glow, Brighter or fainter—less or more! And yet, Oh! yet, I fain would learn, From zeal to zeal to travel on, With love still born from love, to burn— For thy sake ruined and undone! But my Devotion is so deep, To all thou hast been—wert before, A silence, like a charmed sleep, Hath fallen upon my true Heart's core! Oh! for Indifference, for awhile To learn those dazzling looks by heart, To study each transcendant smile, And perfect make my lover's part! For ill that noble part I play, Who see thee but as first I saw, While thou acquirest, day by day, Fresh powers to charm by some sweet law! Oh! for Indifference, for awhile, All, all thy dazzling looks to learn, And then, o'erpowered by one dear smile, With Love a thousand-fold to burn! For calm Indifference, for awhile, To see thee all that now thou art, To study each consummate smile, And perfect make my lover's part! BRIGHT STARS. Bright Stars! slow blossoming on the lap of Night, Fair flowers of Heaven, all made of smiles and light, How shine ye strongly on the uplifted eye, How proudly, how illustrious-dazzlingly. How do ye gleam forth from the lap of Night, In trembling pomp, in luxury of light, And make the darkness beautiful in Heaven, Whence all the sterner gloomier shades are driven? Our World and ye are brethren—what then we, Who lowliest wanderers on its surface be? Worms, clay, and ashes!—who have ever been Dust in the balance—specks upon the scene! Oh! what are we, compared with those proud spheres, Which count milleniums of our fleeting years, Those comrades of our own Majestic World, Whose glories nightly stream for us unfurled? Look round on our bright Earth! learn, learn from thence The mystery of their dread magnificence! Could we as near their mighty forms behold, What splendours then should to our view unfold! But from unthought of distance must we trace Your outlines pure and fine—ye Kings of Space! And yet how beauteous—how sublime appears The marshalled army of the outshining spheres! And what is Man—the shadow and the reed, With these contrasted?—what is Man indeed? The floating sand, borne swiftly down the stream! The fleeting mote, that haunts the sunny beam! But, Oh! his Bosom's deepest shrine within, Uncrushed by suffering, and unquenched by sin, There lives a spark, to which their mightiest blaze Is as the meteor fading from the gaze. A Spark, to which those congregated fires Are as the taper, when its gleam expires; A Spark, from the All-enkindling Glory caught— To which ten thousand hosts of Suns are nought. Proud Worlds, that line the illumined depths of night, Ye splendent shadows of the Light of Light! How shine ye down upon the uplifted eye— How brightly—how illustrious-dazzlingly! But, Oh! the immortal Soul, though shrined in clay, Could well eclipse ye with its faintest ray: Creation, with its countless worlds of fire, Is not so precious to the All-forming Sire! Majestic Worlds!—your shrines are arks august, Yet must they yield to temples built of dust! For there the Eternal makes His dread abode! Thrones of His Glory ye!—these—thrones of God! Proud Stars! that fret the ethereal vault of Night, Still burn, still blaze with ever-kindling Light! Still shine ye—stream ye on the uplifted eye, Thus brightly—thus illustrious-dazzlingly! The Soul can meet those starry looks of Light, Armed with its own yet more victorious might— Meet them half way—yet move not from its place, Since in itself it spreads—the Space of Space! Stars!—they are dust, compared with conscious Souls! Though each receives for ever, as it rolls, Rays of His wide showered glory—splendour-shod— Thrones of His Glory these—those Thrones of God! ONE WORD. One Word! and on that little word My life—my very Soul seems poured; Farewell!—but yet it soothes our woes, That each the other's secret knows. Oh! treasure thou for evermore, Within thy faithful bosom's core, That precious secret of my Soul, While circling hours progressing roll! Treasure that secret in thy heart— Beloved and trusted that thou art! As I shall thine, with jealous care, Come smiling joy, or stern despair! One Word! and that one little word, Strikes, deeply strikes each feeling's chord: Farewell! but, Oh! it soothes our woes, That each the other's secret knows! Enough! ere Time perchance hath run Through many a rising, setting Sun, We shall again in gladness meet, Once past—e'en absence' days seem fleet. Enough! while dark days intervene, And gloom and grief cloud all the scene, Love in our Souls shall strengthened be, And perfected through constancy! His power Divine is poorly shown, His wondrous might is little known, When only cloudless skies are spread Above his crowned and starry head! When round him storm and midnight roar, He spreads his plumes on high to soar, So the eagle springs at once to Heaven, When from his earth-built eyrie driven. Content with lowlier range perchance When basking in joy's sunny glance; When from its peaceful haunts expelled How vast its flight's unmeasured field! Love! Love! when sorrow and when care For thee a couch of thorns prepare— How dost thou win from pain and strife A yet diviner, deeper life! Till Absence hath applied her test Unto the fond and feeling breast— How little can its truth be known, By that 'tis proved, and that alone! Oh! while thou'rt ever at my side, I may not feel a tender pride In fostering still with faithful zeal The love it is my boast to feel! Who could but love thee fondly well When with thee, deeply blessed, they dwell; Who could do otherwise than love— Who near thee breathe, and live and move! But time and absence may efface An unfixed love's fast failing trace— Time, time and absence may remove All but a life-enwoven love! And time and absence now shall show How well in Solitude and woe Our hearts shall keep their cherished Vow, Enough!—I fear not—nor shalt thou! 'Tis done—we part—for thee, for thee— And for thy stainless constancy, Can I undoubting answer now— For me and mine, Love! answer thou! So well each other's deepest hearts We know through all their throbbing parts, Each can the other's truth attest, With confidence unclouded bless'd! So well each other's hearts we know, So blent our thoughts smooth currents flow, Each can with fearless tone reply For the Beloved One's constancy! Aye! mirrored in each other's breast In hallowed and unbroken rest, Our feelings and our Souls are shown There deeper stamped than in our own! Clear mirrored in each other's hearts Through powerful Love's endearing arts, Our Minds, our very Souls are shown There deeper stamped than even our own! Farewell! farewell! on that one word, My life—my fainting Soul is poured; Farewell—Oh! linger not—on—on— Or all thy courage will be gone! Farewell! Oh, tear thyself away, Or here thou must for ever stay; If thou but list to Love's fond call, Thou'lt ne'er have strength to go at all! Farewell! farewell! on that one word Our lives—our very Souls are poured, But yet it soothes our bitter woes, That each the other's Secret knows! HENCE, FATAL DREAM! Hence! fatal dream—away—away— Haunt me not thus, by night and day— My hope—my happiness are o'er— Hence—hence—and haunt my heart no more! Hence, fatal Image—haste! depart! Nor leave thy shadow on my heart! No more on poisons let it feed, Pillared and propped upon a reed! Hence, Image, worshipped and adored, However thou mayst be deplored— Thy very memory let me weed From this poor heart—despoiled indeed! Then fatal Dream! away—away— Though every dear Hope's every ray Must thus be clouded darkened o'er— Hence—hence, and haunt my heart no more! In vain—in vain I toil and strive, In that Dream's shadow must I live! In vain I seek from fate to fly, In that Dream's shadow I must die! HOW CANST THOU WEARY OF MY LOVE? How canst thou weary of my Love Which doth through endless changes move? Ever in my quick mind and me Shalt thou meet dear Variety! No two thoughts in my heart or brain, Be they of Pleasure or of Pain, Were ever yet alike—or bound With chains of measuring links around. Need'st thou this truth then to be taught? Think'st thou the changes rung on thought Are like the changes rung on bells, Whose various music sinks or swells? The bells themselves are still the same— My very Mind's ethereal frame— Swift as the uncounted moments fly, Is altering everlastingly! On bells—these varying harmonies From source of varying order rise, At length the whole may be run through! My Soul and Mind are ever new! Thou need'st not range—thou need'st not rove To seek each day a different love, Thou'lt still find in my mind and me, A never-checked diversity! Thou need'st not rove—thou need'st not range To seek incessant endless change; Oh! where wilt thou such variance find, As in my ever varying Mind? If thou didst love me yesterday, To-day thou must a false part play If still thou lov'st, since I no more The Being am I was before! If thus thou'rt therefore true to me, Thy constancy's inconstancy! Thyself thou scarcely conscious art, Of what she is that rules thy heart! Then how canst thou e'er weary be Of my unbounded love for thee? My love for thee, that varies still, But yet can know no check nor chill. Since it ev'n changeth day by day— Yet keeps its own triumphant way!— My love may change—but still 'tis love, All language and all thought above! It changeth—though so deep, so true, And ever wears an aspect new; It changeth fast as moments fly, But yet 'tis love unchangeably! Now in rich eloquence 'twould shower The passion-hurricanes of power; Now shrink in silence—mild and meek— Nor seek, nor wish its truth to speak! Now 'twould, in lowliest guise, repress The jealousies of tenderness; Now, in a haughty burst of ire, 'Twould feed and fan the raging fire! No! never canst thou weary be Of my devoted love for thee: No measured tenour doth it keep— Though all devoted still—and deep! No dull monotony is there, Though strong as death, 'tis light as air: Not thus may change the inconstant moon— The rainbow varieth not so soon. The clouds may never change so fast; The rocks may ne'er so strongly last; Varying as water is my love, Eternal as the sun above! Say, then, canst thou e'er weary be Of my surpassing love for thee? No, never, never shalt thou prove Weary of me, or of my love! I BOAST NOT. I boast not of my boundless love for thee; Who would not love thee upon whom thy smile Hath shone so brightly and so gloriously, Their very souls to blind and to beguile? Who would not love thee, though that smile supreme Might not for them be shining, since thou art All that the young enthusiast's richest dream Hath painted as an idol of the heart. Who would not make thee as I make thee still, The sun and centre of each passionate thought, And know no law so binding as thy will— And yet confess their worship is as naught. Who would not prize thee all earth's wealth above! Oh! who would not with exultation die— Thou only object of my speechless love! To live one moment in thy memory? I boast not of my love for thee—Oh! no; But blush that it should thus imperfect be So far thy merits and thy charms below, Studying to make it ever worthier thee. Who would not love thee—who would not resign All, all for thee—for thee with rapture die— And hail their death—as I shall soon do mine— To live one moment in thy memory? STANZAS. [I ask no pity for my pain—no feeling for my care] I ask no pity for my pain—no feeling for my care, Since a luxury of anguish 'tis, and a rapture of despair; Proud, proud am I, to brook this Grief; and think you I would part With this rich Sorrow, shrined and throned, like an idol, at my heart. Away! how little then can ye of such sweet sufferings know! Why, what hath Happiness to give worth such a wealth of Woe? Each moment 'tis increasing, and each moment it is made More perfect and more potent—and it shall not know to fade! 'Tis a Beatific Sadness this—and a pure and precious Woe— Oh! what hath Life to give so true, so lasting here below. Be gay, ye dreamers, all you prize shall vanish from your view, But those who love pale Sorrow's charms shall find her ever true. Methinks that Sorrow—mighty Power! in her victorious day, Hath melted all my living Soul—my very Soul away, And ta'en its place, her own sad self, to live for evermore Within my bosom's haunted cell, my heart's deep aching core. Be gay! ye dreamers, ye who seek to smile your lives away, Ye yet may find how hopes delude, how pleasures can betray. Ah! those like me, to thee who turn pale Sorrow, first and last, Need never fear the future hour—nor e'er pine for the past! I crave no pity for my pain—no feeling for my care, 'Tis a luxury of deep anguish this—and a rapture of despair. I would not for your vain delights, ye pleasure-lovers part— With this rich Sorrow of the Soul—this sadness of the heart! SUFFER ME BUT TO LOVE THEE. Suffer me but to love thee—but to pour My heart's deep feelings forth—a boundless store, And lay a life's devotion at thy feet, Hear—hear me now Love's fervent vows repeat. Suffer me but to love thee—but to live On thy dear looks, and the clear light they give, And make my Soul a temple bright and lone, For thee, but thee, and my true heart a throne! That throne, that temple, shall enduring be, Their deep foundations deeper than the sea, And their proud everlasting walls as strong As the round World—that ages may not wrong. Suffer me but to love thee—but to bring My heart of hearts—a lowly offering— And dedicate it deeply unto thee— Oh! suffer me to love thee boundlessly! A lowly offering Love may be!—but still Where that is, changeless through life's strife and ill— Changeless through all—save deepening more and more, Not lightly should such offering be passed o'er. Talk ye of bands of Guardian-angels sent From realms above yon starry firmament— The steps of mortals pitying to surround, And ward the dangers off by which they're bound. They need no Guardian Angels from above To whom Heaven dedicates a human love, A host of strength is the devoted heart, Where well it plays its high and zealous part. Suffer me then to love thee—dwell enshrined A treasured image in my heart and mind, Whence all unworthy things I must expel, Because thou deign'st therein ev'n thus to dwell. If for the loved it may a blessing be To be thus cherished—while Life's vain years flee— Ev'n thus to love—love worthily and well, This is a benefit no words may tell!— As when some high and honoured guest arrives, To whom the host a princely welcome gives, And seeks to please and serve with studied care, For whom he doth all fitting things prepare— So when the all-beloved image comes To house within love's heart, that best of homes, The trembling lover strives with anxious will To banish thence all things unworthy still. Oh! let me love thee! so shall I aspire To lift my very spirit high and higher, Till all my thoughts shall as winged angels be, That they may bear one bright thought company. But let me love thee!—so I still shall seek To chase afar all worthless dreams and weak, Till all my thoughts like white robed angels be, That they may dwell with th' Heav'nly thought of thee! Suffer me but to love thee—but to link My Soul ere yet in Death's great deep I sink— With something so surpassing, so supreme, It makes this world one world of glory seem! I THINK OF THEE. I think of thee—and all dark thoughts of sorrow or of sin, That ever have abode in gloom my troubled heart within, Take flight from that most lovely dream, from that enchanted thought, Till with mines of Purity and Peace my bosom seemeth fraught. How should unblest or loveless thoughts my gentle one accord With bright and blessed thoughts of thee—the chosen and th' adored! As soon should falcons fierce and doves harmoniously agree, And desperate sharks with dolphins shy that sport along the sea, Leopards and timorous antelopes together shall consent, Ere thoughts of strife and thoughts of thee shall be together blent; Lightnings and sunbeams wreathe themselves into one glitt'ring chain, Ere dreams of wrong and dreams of thee shall mingle in my brain. I think of thee—and all dark thoughts of sorrow, strife, and sin, That ever have in gloom abode my troubled heart within, Take flight from that most happy thought—thus, thus Love, it is thine To make the Heart wherein thou dwell'st a pure and perfect shrine! MY LONE HEART DROOPS. My lone heart droops—with many a bursting sigh It trembling mourns, while joyless hours fleet by, Pale phantom things, that seem with sorrow bowed, Haunt it—fond Memory! round thy steps they crowd! My sad heart droops—Oh! let me not think why, 'Tis vain to analyze Despondency!— A thousand cares from one that was shall spring, If curiously we sound the heart's deep string! We magnify and multiply our woes, We rouse a host of hidden slumbering foes, We tread upon the serpent's nest, and bring The coiled-up reptiles forth to hiss and sting. My lone heart droops—Oh! let me not think why, 'Tis vain to analyze Despondency!— Ten thousand cares from one that was shall spring, If curiously we sound the heart's deep string! Let those foes slumber—let those serpents rest Coiled up and couched within their viewless nest— What gain, what good, can it e'er be to know, Still helpless to o'ercome the heart's deep woe? SONNET. [Rise from the Dead—lost Dreams! be disentombed!] Rise from the Dead—lost Dreams! be disentombed! Come back before these mournful eyes to shine, Which earthwards ever heavily incline— For which of old all common things assumed Hues of glad loveliness, while sweetly bloomed In her own blushing Paradise divine Hope the Enchantress!—and its key was mine. Thence driven, a Wanderer have I long been doomed!— And will ye ne'er come back, high dreams of old, Which once these dimmed and earthwards drooping eyes Rejoicing and enraptured could behold?— No! ye shall ne'er return—yet why these sighs, I shall rejoin ye when Life's years are told, Ripened and realized in the opening skies! NO! NO! IT MUST NOT BE. No! no! it must not be again As it hath been—in days of old; It is a weary, heavy pain To feel joys melting from our hold! To yield all, all the deep heart loved— Oh! sentence sharp, and stern, and sure; But since these blessings are removed, Then let me try even now to endure. So should we show our gratitude To Heaven for rich gifts—given before, Thus yielding them with chastened mood, When they may be our own no more. We should our gratitude display For gifts of price no wealth can buy By yielding them—when borne away To Him who gave—unmurmuringly. Aye! even the sorrow and the woe, By bitter contrast deepened thrice— The adversity itself we owe To Heaven, to make a gift of price! Yea—our heart's woe, even thus do we Owe to the indulgent Heaven to make A gift of price—though dark to see, For bygone past enjoyment's sake. And all that was our worst despair Shall so another hope become, A high and occupying care, A trust to all—a bliss to some. While conscience and while Heaven approve None can with hopeless suffering mourn; The adversity's a gift of love That teaches us to Heaven to turn. In proud Prosperity's fair day, Alas! how often we forget The debt of gratitude to pay, The boundless and the endless debt. SONNET. [Deep is the shadow round my pathway spread!] Deep is the shadow round my pathway spread! Oh! that a myriad thoughts would come to o'erflow One settled Feeling in my heart—and show The Beauty of the Universe instead Of this despair—'tis as the shrouded dead To dwell within the world yet nought to know Of all the glories that around us glow, The wonders of the wealth on all sides shed! I gaze on blank, bleak Sorrow till all's o'er, Whose shadowy face a deadly beauty has— Oh! that a myriad, myriad thoughts, and more, Would come to crush—(vain, fruitless hope! Alas!)— One Single Settled Feeling in the heart's core!— But Pleasure passes!—Pain too yet shall pass! SONNET. [There are, who wander through this world so fair] There are, who wander through this world so fair With eyes closed up against its charms and pride, Still scattered round in rich profusion wide— With lips sealed 'gainst Life's cup—ev'n though it bear Bright draughts of pleasantness and strength—while care For ever dwells—a shadow at their side, And doth away all gentler visions chide, Till Life seems little but a long Despair. Some Grief hath made them darkly all its own, And though fair stars of more auspicious ray Invite them, their sad constancy is shown By turning ever from Hope's smiles away, To cling to memories that should long have flown— Man—voluntary service loves to pay! SONNET. [Love! thy most true and strong interpreters] Love! thy most true and strong interpreters, That breathe thine eloquence unanswerably, These are the blush—the tear—the unbosomed sigh— The look, that feeling makes so deeply hers!— These are thine emblems too!—great Love, that stirs So sweetly in young hearts, is born to die None can tell wherefore—not himself knows why, But so it is, experience still avers— Perchance 'tis well! this world were all too fair Could lasting love within its sphere be found; He brings a current of immortal air Wafted by his enchanted wings around Where'er he is—sweet dreams of Heaven are there— But they should soar and spurn each earthly bound! WHAT ARE MYSTERIES? The Majesty of yon dread Heavens of Night, A vault of gloom and fire—of shade and light— The pomp of Summer, and the Winter's waste, The sweeping Lightning in its dazzling haste, The rushing Comet on its path of fear, The voice of Winds in their sublime career, The roll of Seas that own a deep controul— The shock of tempests that disturbs the Soul; These are not Mysteries—they are things sublime, But unto these the strong-plumed thought can climb. The flight of Time, upon his noiseless way, The birth of Light, the wondrous Spring of Day, The change of Seasons on their 'stablished round— Nature's august rehearsal underground, Where still her work of preparation vast She carrieth on, till perfect grown at last She bursts upon the stage, and forth to sight Acts her great part i' the face of Heaven and light; These are not Mysteries—to these things at once The Soul, with all her voices, gives response. Seed-time and Harvest-time, that ever know Their due recurrences in constant flow, The fountains of the waters—full and free, That never emptied or exhausted be! The difference of Earth's climates, which supply Productions endless in diversity! The mingling Elements and all their laws, Whose veil great Science' hand but half withdraws; These are not Mysteries—these the Soul receives, Unquestioning—and undoubtingly believes! And, Oh! the powers of that deep Soul intense, Its crowned and spiritual magnificence, Its musical enthusiasms sublime— Its hopes that scorn the horizon of brief Time! Its thoughts that thunder-strike great Nature's throne, And make the grandeurs of her state their own! That share her sceptered majesty, and bind Her scattered beams in one broad blaze of Mind! Are these things Mysteries? No! the aspiring thought Knows—feels—whence the heav'nly inspiration's caught! The ignoble littleness of daily life— Its dearth, its gloom, its sordor, and its strife; Its vain and vapid schemes—its petty dreams— Its vaporous hopes—like ignis-fatuus gleams; Its poor desires—its dull and dead demands, Its struggles in Art's adamantine bands; Its drudgings in vile Custom's beaten ways, The unworthy part the immortal Spirit plays; These things are Mysteries, which we may not sound, Which day by day more startle and surround! Aye! the accursed cold calculating Art, Which masks and petrifies the worldly heart— Masks it—and round it seems superfluous thrown, Like the cold moss that shrouds the colder stone; The absorbing interest in the low and vain, The little care for all that most should chain The Spirit—in its own starred sphere supreme— The dull deep trance—or phrenzied fever-dream; These—these are Mysteries—awful and profound, By no eye fathomed—by no hand unbound! The impetuous competition—fond and wild— For the poor dross that hath so long defiled This groaning World—the dross of Wealth and Pride, For which all nobler things seem thrust aside; The Avarice, Luxury—th' envy strife, and hate, Which this fair Earth so foully desecrate; The ravening Passions, with their fiery surge, Which centuries still to circling centuries urge; These—these things are—these things must ever be The height, and crown, and front of Mystery! And all Life's trite and trivial accidents The causes mean—the mocking consequents— The foiled endeavours—the ill-weighed effects— The strange observances, more strange neglects— The mad devotion to the present day, Which melts, like snow-flakes in the grasp, away; The awful oblivion of the time to come, While ev'ry step we take—is o'er some tomb; These things are fearful Mysteries—these things make The pondering Mind to shrink—the Soul to shake. All things in Nature too, slight, brief, and frail— That seem but made in vain—but formed to fail Like very bubbles on her sea-broad scene— But no! my Soul—these are not base nor mean; Nothing in mighty Nature's glorious chain Can be of little worth, or made in vain; But all things there imperatively tend To some unseen, unknown, but certain end; Yet these things for our thoughts perplexed must be, Bound in the shadowy veil of Mystery! Ev'n the most fragile flower in Summer's wreath, That looks on Life but to decline in Death, The frail ephemeron that sports an hour, Then fades forgotten in its birth-place bower, The mote that floats within the sunny beam, All have their parts to play—howe'er we deem— All have their place, their portion, and their part, While thou, wise Nature, their instructress art; These scarce are Mysteries to the sage's mind, Though their full reasons he may fail to find! But all those weak, those worthless vanities, Which worldly natures ever seek and prize— Those miserable gewgaws, base and mean, That are indeed but bubbles on the scene, Those wretched fooleries that we well may call Little and low, that have no worth at all— The trappings and the tinsels that can please The cheated sense—these things are Mysteries—these!— And thought and feeling—heart, and soul, and mind Shall ever these unravelled Mysteries find! QUEEN BERENGARIA'S COURTESY. Queen Berengaria called aside The fairest maiden of her train— Young Britomart, who ofttimes sighed As she were pierced with secret pain. “Now tell me—tell me, Britomart, Fair maiden with the golden hair, What sorrows pierce thy gentle heart— What—what may be thy secret care?” Nay! mighty Queen, demand not thou Of my vain sorrows, and my grief; But let me smoothe my saddened brow, My woe shall never find relief. Let me unmurmuring then submit To what must be for evermore— What's writ in iron Fate is writ— Then be my weak repinings o'er. And, mighty Mistress! ask me not What is the source of this regret, That grief I never yet forgot, I now will struggle to forget! It is not meet, it is not right, In thy high presence thus to mourn, To pine thus in thy royal sight, By anguish and distress o'er-borne.” “Maiden!” said Berengaria then, “'Tis Love, I guess, that makes thee sad, Tell me thy chosen from all men— His love ev'n yet shall make thee glad! Oh! pale, pale pensive Britomart, Thou canst not—shalt not love in vain— Then courage!—courage!—arm thy heart From fear and doubting to refrain. Clear then, indeed, that clouded brow, And cast those heavy looks aside, As I am England's Queen, I vow Thou yet shalt be the loved one's bride. But tell me—tell me, Britomart, Who is't that pales that cheek of thine? And if thou dost not steal his heart, Maiden! thou may'st smite me through mine.” “Oh! Royal Queen, now pardon me, If I indeed the truth must tell; What is my lowly fate to thee That thou should'st on its sufferings dwell? Most gracious mistress that thou art, If such thy dread and queenly will, Hear then the tale of Britomart, Yet pardon her and pity still. The Constable of Chester 'tis Who win's thy maiden's youthful love, But she who made his earthly bliss Now smiles a gentle saint above. The Lady Blanche, Earl Godfrey's child, His beauteous lady love was seen— She died—since then hath he ne'er smiled, My mighty mistress and my queen. He looks not upon Britomart, Nor heeds nor marks her changing cheek— 'Tis for another that his heart Must beat and bleed until it break. He shuns the banquet and the chase, The festal-hall, the radiant court— Empty at council-board his place, Nor shares he in the joy of sport. He shuns the masque, and shuns the mime, And shuns the joust's chivalrous cheer— The Troubadour's sweet lays and rhyme Are discord to his heart and ear. When all are merry in the field, Or gay and jocund at the board, Doth he to hopeless anguish yield, And pine for her—his Soul's adored. For plighted were their noble hands, United were their faithful hearts— Grim Death undid Love's dearest bands, Whose touch alone such love ties parts. My heart was his, even while he smiled Enraptured at his fair one's side— It was a hopeless love, and wild— But Prudence checked it not—nor Pride. Oh! very mournful was I then, And Grief then struck me sharp and sore, But I would bear that grief again, To see him blest and glad once more. I feel—I feel—a thousand fold More sufferings now must be my share, I saw him glad and blest of old, And now I see him in despair! Oh! could I call her from the tomb, Methinks e'vn I were happy then, While every shade of grief and gloom Should melt from his proud mien again. Erewhile I deemed my misery Was matchless in its great despair, But find 'tis harder far to see His grief—nor this to soothe nor share. Oh! could I call her from the tomb Whom once my jealous heart abhorred, E'en happy then should be my doom, Viewing thy bliss—my heart's dear lord.” “What! Maiden, is't that man of woes, That pale Knight of the rueful brow, That breaks thy peace and thy repose? Why 'tis a hapless love, I trow! Who falls in love with that pale youth, With his fixed look and freezing air, Must find that gloomy love, in sooth, Related nigh unto despair! But—Sweet, take cheer, thou need'st not fear This gentle rival in the tomb, Despite his love, he'll faithless prove, For sake of thy sweet living bloom! But hence with looks of grief and fear, Or verily our hopes are lost— Methinks thou seek'st e'en now to appear Meet rival to a bloodless ghost! But this can never be the way To charm him from his cares at last; 'Tis love and life that must repay His long dark sorrows of the past! Love, Life, and blooming Beauty's wile, That only now his griefs can chase— Then practise the prevailing smile, And banish sadness from that face! And so, good lack, 'tis him indeed That sighing man of many woes— That makes thy tender heart to bleed, And bars thy pleasure and repose! Now, on my word, I marvel much— No thought of him had crossed my mind— How came he that soft heart to touch; It must be of the melting kind! Methought 'twas young Sir Launcelot, Or he that Knight with locks of gold, Sir Malcolm Bruce, the stout young Scot, Or country Harold, blithe and bold! Or he from the Provençal shore, He of the lance and of the lyre, Skilled in the lay and legend's lore, With Soul all fancy and all fire. Or he, that wild adventurous Knight, Whose bark hath sailed o'er many a sea, Sir Eustace Montmorency hight, The brave—the gallant—and the free! I wot, though thou ne'er heaved a sigh For Montmorency, brave and proud, There have been dames of lineage high That have another tale avowed! Ask dark-eyed Lady Geraldine, Or fairest Countess Maude—sweet saint, Who kneels for ever at the shrine, To cleanse her Soul from Love's dire taint. But—Britomart—pale Britomart, Of him I thought not—he who sways, Who reigns, the lord of that soft heart, That mute knight of the rueful gaze! Yet, true he hath the blackest hair That ever waved o'er manhood's brow, The darker for the paleness there, Like storm-black shadows spread o'er snow. And eyes, too, of that deepest blue That gleams like Syria's sultry sky When Heaven assumes its heavenliest hue— The depths of its cerulean dye! Well, Maiden, courage! trust in me— To thee I pledge my royal word Thou yet shalt of a surety be, The lov'd Bride of thy bosom's lord!” Then to the queen of all the land Knelt down that maid of fair estate, She knelt and kissed the whitest hand Ther e'er bore glorious sceptre's weight. Days passed—ere many days had sped, Her wish Queen Berengaria gained; Well minded she what she had said, And faithful to her word remained. The Constable of Chester came Of matters with the King to treat; Soon as the fair Queen heard the name, She, smiling, deigned the knight to greet. She heeded not, that pained and vexed, He sought her courtesy to shun, And looked like one with grief perplexed— Bewildered—troubled—and undone. Gently she deigned to speak with him, Who seemed a bankrupt of the heart; The sport of Fortune's barbarous whim, The victim of Misfortune's dart! Gently to him she mildly spoke, Not oft such voice attention craves, 'Twas softer than the softest stroke Of silvery oars on silvery waves. He looked up to the lovely Queen, Then straight looked sadly down again; A deeper sadness wrapt his mien, A darker shade of keener pain. Once more she spoke—and he looked up One little moment and no more, The poisoned dregs of Sorrow's cup For him were bubbling, brimming o'er. He looked upon the lovely Queen, Ever to look right soon away, Though the glory of her regal mien Was as the pride of opening day! She bade him to the festival— Even to the royal feast, that night— She bade him to the illumined hall— Though sore he sighed—that wretched knight. She said with gentlest tone and bland— “No more must thou a mourner be, But join the lofty of the land— The flower of our nobility. 'Tis not the gallant heart that sinks When struck by Fate's first cruel blow, The lip of honour dauntless drinks To dash aside the cup of woe!” Once more he turned and looked on her, Her whom to look on was to love; How soon did his warped thoughts recur To his sweet sainted maid above? Still at the banquet and the chase From that day ever was he seen, The happier still, as his high place Was nearer to the matchless Queen! “Now bind your glossy braids I pray, Fair Britomart, with gems and flowers; Know ye the tourney's held to-day Beneath the Palace' royal towers. A nameless Knight shall come perchance, With doughty arm of warrior might, For thy proud charms to break a lance, And win high honours in thy sight! Nay, blush not with mock-modest air, Although so dainty 'tis to see, I gage Sir Alberic will be there, And nought could bring him there, save thee.” The trumpets sound loud, loud and long, The lists are set—the knights are met, Assembled are the martial throng, The weapons threat—the coursers fret. The Queen in glorious state on high Awaits to give the well won prize, And in the Heav'n of that blue eye The Sun of Glory seems to rise. Begins the proud and gallant strife— Knights never fought so fierce before, But little store they set by life, And redly runs the spouting gore. No marvel, since the prize that day By sceptered hand was to be given, And eke the fairest hand they say, That e'er match'd snow new fall'n from Heav'n. Ha!—raise up that fall'n knight, behold His foe no stroke unmeaning deals— Comes forth that noble victor bold, Before the Queen the conqueror kneels. “Well done, Sir Constable! well done— Good faith—the fight was sharp and sore, The doughty foe thou'st just o'erthrown, Was never bowed or bent before! The fiery Saracenic Wars Knew not an arm so stout and strong, Your's must be fair and favouring stars That saved you from some deadly wrong.” With kind approving smiles so spoke The beauteous Queen in accents sweet, But while she speaks, Good speed us! look— The knight hath fainted at her feet! They raised, they bore him from the ground, They sought his wound with anxious care, They sought on brow and breast his wound, No wound, no speck, no spot was there. “Now, damsel! 'twas for love of thee,” The royal Berengaria cried, “Sir Alberic sank on tottering knee, And sighed and swooned our throne beside. He might not bear his prize to gain From any other hands than thine; Didst thou look pitying on his pain— Why gav'st thou not some gentle sign? So far retired thou sat'st concealed, Doubtless he marked thee not before, And when that sweet face blushed revealed, It pierced him to his bosom's core! Now, bind your glossy braids so bright, And deck them too with chaplets rare; Know ye the revel's held to-night, Be thou the fairest of the fair! Lo, damsel, I will lend to thee My carcanet of Orient gems— The very pride of jewellery, 'Tis worth an hundred diadems. My royal Richard's kingly hands First clasped it round my neck I ween; Then, cried he, of all Earth's broad lands, How look'st thou now the rightful Queen! Haste, bring it hither now I pray, 'Tis stored my gems of state among; Haste, gentle Maude and Ladye May, Why lingering loiter ye so long? I guess you're seized with jealous spite, Because these glittering gems I lend To this fair damsel for the night, Speed, speed—we've no spare time to spend! Straight clasp it on that I may see If it becomes thee, bravely well— Why! the Queen of Sumptuous Soldanrie, Near thee with envious ire might dwell! And Maiden! for thy private ear— I guess Sir Alberic's deep dark eye To thee beyond all others dear, Hath marked this pride of jewellery. Some few nights past, I mind I wore The dazzling bauble at the feast, He gazed upon it o'er and o'er, Methought his gaze would ne'er have ceas'd.” The revel hath not yet begun, And vacant is the columned hall, Decked ready, many a lovely one Awaits the summons and the call! And Britomart—fair Britomart In dazzling pride of rich array, Yet with a faint foreboding heart, Wishes the weary hours away. Pearls shine upon her glossy hair, Whose golden lengths, whose burnished braids Are wreathed in crowning circlets fair— Rich locks of auburn's brightest shades! Around her snowy polished arms Gleam bracelets of the emerald stone, Heightens a rose-tinged robe her charms, Round which is clasped her thick gemm'd zone. Upon her stomachere shone fair Pure brilliants sparkling clear and far, Traced out in fine devices rare, Each glittering like a sheeny star. But Berengaria's queenly boon All other ornaments outshone; As sink the stars before the moon, These sank near that transcendant one!— It blazed with thousand colours bright, Blazed with effulgence ever new— A stream of fire—a sea of light— Startling the rash beholder's view! The maiden's in her chamber lone, And troubling thoughts perplex her mind— What aileth thee, thou gentle one, Can Fate be now to thee unkind? She riseth from her carven chair, And to the chamber window goes; She gazes forth—Ah! Ladye—there— All, all, is quiet and repose. “Now out upon this sick suspense,” With weak and wailing tone she cries, “My tortured Soul but drains from thence A draught of fiery agonies. Now let me seek St. Agnes' shrine, These pangs are more than I can bear, In sore anxiety I pine, And almost crave mine old despair. Methought yestre'en he looked on me, This morn I know he looked away— I madden with this misery, For peace and pardon let me pray!” Then forth she fared—with noiseless foot She tracked the palace' corridors; The echoes round were hushed and mute, Her foot swept light the unsounding floors. And as in all her rich array She passed the casement's broad carved frame, Ever the moonbeam's silvery play Seemed turning into sudden flame. From darkness, when she came forth where The windows lit the passage-wall, A rain of coloured glory rare Seemed ever round her form to fall. Still as she passed those windows high, Bright in her gem emblazed attire, The stars seemed shooting from the sky, Showered round her form in showers of fire, In showers of rainbowed fire and flame, With every tint triumphal crowned, When forth from gloom to light she came, Girt by a galaxy around. Now to the right the Ladye turned Where deeper, thicker shadows lay, But still the royal jewels burned, Catching the faint light's faintest ray. 'Twas like a chain of magic gems, That sumptuous carcanet, I ween, Troth!—worth an hundred diadems, As said that fair and glorious Queen. Now turned the Ladye to the right, To cross a spacious gallery fair— Moved not a dim-traced form in sight, A shadow 'mongst the shadows there. The Ladye turned her head aside, The Ladye bent her steps askant— It was not fear—it was not pride— Did not her heart with anguish pant? The Ladye turned her head aside To avoid the intruding stranger near; 'Twas not caprice, and 'twas not pride— 'Twas pain, not pride—faint grief, not fear. The Chapel's portal still she nears, And sweet St. Agnes' shrine of grace; A sound of hurrying steps she hears, And quickens more and more her pace. She quickens more her pace—but lo! Sudden her hand is seized and pressed; A kiss hath burnt on its soft snow, 'Tis strained unto a throbbing breast! She starts—she turns in terror there, The impetuous stranger's gaze to meet, Of murmured vows of love aware— 'Tis Alberic kneeling at her feet! Ha! in his turn he starts—he shrinks— He drops that passive trembling hand; Some mystery must be there, methinks, More than they well can understand. 'Tis his turn now to shrink—to start— When looks the affrighted lady round; Faintly he whispers “Britomart!”— Like one whom wildering doubts confound! Then from the ground uprising slow, With brow confused and trembling frame, He mutters something hoarse and low— She can but catch the Queen's high name! Enough!—that one faint word aside Unravelled all that strange wild scene, The royal carcanet's gemmed pride Made him mistake her for the Queen! Enough! she needs indeed no more, The truth is clear as noon-day's air; All Hope—all dreams of Hope are o'er, Her life is waste—her heart despair! She totters back against the wall, Her film'd sight fails—her vexed brain swims; She leans back there—else must she fall, Such fainting tremours melt her limbs. She nothing asks—she nothing says— At once the whole dark truth she knows— A horrid certainty dismays That chilled heart—bleeding fresh with woes. With faultering accents, faint and weak, At length Sir Alberic murmuring said, “Silence is vain—'tis vain to speak— All my Soul's madness is betrayed. Oh! gentle, gentle Britomart, In Queenly Berangaria's train I deem thou hast the tenderest heart Ever to pity other's pain. Now tell me—tell me, Britomart, What must that wretch, that poor wretch do Whose hapless, hopeless, helpless heart With vainest passion is pierced through. I loved one far—Oh! far removed From my fond vow—and from my tear; But she I thus all hopeless loved Now seems almost too near, too near. How e'er I strive my heart to steel— I feel her power—nor can forget— Her sweet reproachful presence feel, And feel, Alas! but to regret. Oh! farther—farther from my sphere Is the idol that I worship now; The sun shall melt in noonday clear, Ere she receive my passion's vow. Yet wherefore did she evermore Seek my rapt bosom to beguile— A heart of stone had learned to adore Beneath that more than mortal smile. Oh! wherefore, wherefore did she still Lead on this maddened heart to break; Was it indeed her heartless will That I should perish for her sake? Oh! Britomart—thyself thou'st seen How me she singled forth from all, For ever bidden by the queen To be her guest in bower and hall. Still showered she endless courtesies Upon my most unworthy head, Regarding me with favouring eyes; Would—would she had ever frowned instead! A high, and true, and fervent heart, Should this be tampered with in sport? Oh! 'twas a harsh and cruel part— But may my martyrdom be short. Most gentle, gentle Britomart!— In royal Berengaria's train, I deem thou hast the readiest heart Ever to pity others' pain! Bethink thee of the deadly woes That must crush down this heart to dust, Without a limit, or a close, A consolation, or a trust! Bethink thee how Death's bitterness Must be my wretched portion here, Loving with wildest love's excess One raised so high above my sphere! Ev'n if she loves me—if her heart Indeed be touched—how dark my lot Ev'n if she loves”—sighed Britomart, With faltering voice, “She loves thee not!” “She loves me not?—yet speak again, Confirm me in my worst despair, So steep in grief my heart and brain, That Love itself may languish there. Oh! let the force of Fate's dire blow So stun my sense and feeling yet, That while I bear the desperate woe, I may the cruel cause forget. I would not curse thee, matchless dame, Though my life's path with thorns thou'st sown; Thy weal, thine honour, and thy fame, To me are dearer than mine own! I would not, could not, ev'n upbraid, Though thou hast plunged my soul in death; To thee I still—till life must fade— Devote mine every thought and breath. She loves me not—Oh! Britomart, Why—why then did she flattering still Lay siege unto a trusting heart, Whose every pulse owned feeling's thrill? Why, why did she then seek to charm, By flattering, fascinating arts, The heart, that crushed by mortal harm, Then smarted even as now it smarts? Why to bewitch and to beguile, Still beckoned she with courteous grace, With winning look and wildering smile, For me to attend her in her place? When through the festal hall she moved, Or when she graced the banquet's board, By all tongues praised—by all hearts loved, But by one guilty wretch adored. Why did she ever me require To play the courtier day by day? Oft vainly sought I to retire, Lady! thou knowest 'tis as I say! Ah! wherefore, wherefore—but no more, I must not and I dare not blame That being I too much adore, The Peerless and the Princely dame! But Britomart, sweet Britomart, Tell me what must that poor wretch do, Whose hapless, hopeless, helpless heart, With such a passion is pierced through?” Hollow and broken—low and deep, Came forth the sad and slow reply, That made the startled flesh to creep, Scarce breathed in mortal accents—“Die!” Long, long and dreary was the pause, Each on the thought of misery dwells, Each but the breath of torture draws, And either heart with anguish swells. At length that gentle lady spoke, And checked Sir Alberic's trance of woe; The stern and frozen silence broke— With steadfast voice—smooth, soft, and low “Nay! pardon me such counsel wild— Pardon my rash, rash lip, I pray, Of impulse still the untutored child, I weigh not well those words I say. When in extremity and need, Some sufferer seeks advice and aid, Woe worth the hand that gives a reed, On which his steps but ill are stayed? A staff of strength the hand should give, From which the mourner seeks for aid,— My voice shall say unto thee—Live! Endure—endure—nor sink afraid! But doff thy lofty garb and proud, And yield thy lands—a mighty boon— To Heaven's all-blessed service vowed, And don the pilgrim's sandal shoon. Go forth—with staff, and belt, and scrip,— Go forth unto the Holy Land, To prayer unceasing vow thy lip, And bow thee unto Heaven's command! Haste! for a better world and life— This utterly and all forsake; Forswear its pomps—forget its strife!” In tones inspired the ladye spake. “Go forth upon the coming day, Lowly and meek, and patient be;— Go forth upon thy blessed way, And all good angels go with thee. Ev'n for the Holy Land depart, With humbled mind and chastened will; May pity bind thy breaking heart, And our sweet ladye bless the still!” She ceased—that voice so dulcet, died Whose gentle echoes soft away; The knight for all rejoinder sighed, As though his soul would fleet away. Then ceased her voice' mellifluous flow, Sweeter than sounds of music's art; Sir Alberic heaved a sigh of woe, As though his very soul would part! At length he said, in solemn tone— “Thanks, ladye—ever thought I thee The gentlest, tenderest, kindest one, 'Mongst all that best and gentlest be. Thanks for thy counsel—be it so, A grievous fault weighs down my soul; Not from such courtesy should flow Wild love, no reason can controul! High-souled devotion—loyal zeal— From taint of selfish passion free; Chivalrous feelings, true and leal, Should spring from that sweet courtesy! Noblest ambition—generous pride, And all clear thoughts that loftiest be, Of stainless worth, approved and tried, Should grow from that great courtesy! And I—base wretch—weak, guilty fool, To poison—that pure fountain turned,— Spurned honour's hest—scorned reason's rule, And with Love's mortal madness burned. How dared these impious lips complain Of her—the august—the sovereign fair, Because my wild and whirling brain Turned her rare goodness to despair. Sweet Britomart—forget—forget The words thou hast heard me breathe to-night, When thousand agonies beset, The mind is warped, and filmed the sight. Blessings be showered on her bright head, Fair peace accompany her state, Good angels o'er her pathway shed The triumphs of a cloudless fate. I am content to bear this woe, Content in penitence to die, That have disgraced my knighthood so, Dishonouring that dear courtesy! Thanks, ladye, for thy counsels sweet, Deny me not to touch that hand,— Thus kneeling lowly at thy feet, Though branded with ill conscience' brand. Deny me not that hand to touch, In token of my thankfulness, My parching tongue might scarce avouch The gratitude 'twould fain express!” Then death-cold lip touched death-cold hand, There frozen, freezing kiss impressed— So ice-barred wave on snow-piled strand Might cheerlessly and chilling rest. Then death-white hand by death-white lip Was touched with lifeless touch and light; So in the wake of some swift ship, Meet wreaths of foam as wan and white. Then from his knee the knight upsprang, And cried aloud with altered tone, Clear as a sudden trumpet's clang, For some glad service proudly blown. “Away—away—my soul must bow, My heart peacemeal by inches die,— But one more night of madness now, And Love's wild rapture-agony! One, one more fair and festal night, Ere yet in dust of death I droop,— Of dear despair—and dark delight, And fatal bliss and phrenzied hope! One, one more night—Oh! Love, to thee, And stern delights of thy despair, The rapture of thine agony! Then years to bend—a life to bear!” Then turning from the Ladye there, He passed with hurried rapid strides The vaulted gallery broad and fair, Then 'mongst the enfolding shadows glides. The Ladye there—that Lady fair, Awaited then some moments still,— With heart-drawn sigh and vacant eye, She seemed oppressed by mortal ill. “Aye—one more night—one, one more night, She muttered through her half closed lips, Of dear despair and dark delight, Then for the wreck—and the eclipse.” At last she moved with tottering gait And laboured steps—unequal pace, She that so stately moved of late, With such a high and measured grace. She passed the long, long corridors, Now hid—now glimpsing in the moon, Opened and closed the impeding doors, And gained her own still chamber soon. Down sank she on the carven chair, Her cold hands clasping hard her knee, A thing as death-like, and as fair As human eye could ever see. She looked not to the left or right, Straight forward stared her wide wild eye, A horrid and a lovely sight As mortal gaze could e'er descry. Her form arrayed with pomp and grace, She dazzles like some feverish dream, While stamped upon her pallid face Despair and death and anguish seem. Surely she ne'er will move again, The blood must in those veins stand still; All petrified with deadly pain, Marble not calmer nor more chill. Swift steps came hurrying to the door— 'Twas opened by a hurrying hand— 'Twas blue-eyed Lady May, who wore The garments gay of mirth's light band! “Why, Britomart, what dost thou here? Hath slumber on thy senses seized; The Queen commands thee to appear, Her Royal Grace is sore displeased. I wot 'tis chiefly for your sake The revelry and mirth to-night— Yet deign ye not to keep awake Forsooth to share the glad delight. The dance and music will have sped, I ne'er beheld such stately cheer, 'Tis a fresh measure now they tread, And thou'rt thus lingering loitering here. And I to thee a sore grudge owe, Thus by her Highness' fair command Despatched to bring thee forth—I trow Through this I'll lose the saraband?” Low muttered faltering in reply, That miserable Maiden lorn, “Mirth, music, dancing, revelry! What mean ye? hence with your foul scorn. “Foul scorn!” now let me pay thee back Thy proud contempt and rank disdain; A messenger thou long shall lack Ere I will play that part again. Foul scorn—I deem foul scorn there is, But not on me may rest the blame, Her Royal Grace shall know of this! Foul scorn!—aye, troth, and burning shame. Thus wrath and frowning, Ladye May Turned her in anger to the door, But breathless met her in her way, The panting Lady Leonore! “Come, Britomart—I scarce can speak So raced I up the steepy stair— What means this foolish untoward freak, The dance half done—and thou not there! Lo! here comes Mistress Rose, beside, On the same errand, I'll be sworn, Not often doth her Highness chide; But such strange freaks may not be borne.” “I come—I come,” said Britomart; “Pardon me, gentle Lady May— I blush now for my thoughtless part, Strange, strange! that I should thus delay!” And she did blush—her clear smooth cheek Erewhile, like sculptured marble's snow, Burned with one dazzling scarlet streak, A startling and surpassing glow. Aye she did blush! that scarlet streak Gave light unnatural to her eye, And flushed along her pearly cheek— A brilliant and a burning dye! 'Twas like a flame in some fair vase Of purest, most transparent grain, That rich streak on that pallid face— A blazing and a blending stain. At once she rose—she led the way, Close followed by the smiling band, Glittering in all her rich array— The loveliest Ladye of the land! The loveliest Ladye of the land!— The stateliest and most bright save one; In blue-eyed Beauty fair and bland, The Mistress of that Land's proud Throne! Fair Britomart she led the way; They hurried, hurried, to the Hall— How, where the spectral moonbeams play, Their shadows sweep along the wall! Sweet May and Lady Leonore, And fairest Mistress Rose, I ween; While Britomart still walked before, Impatient for the enchanted Scene! Impatient for the Scene she seemed, So hurryingly she led them on, While, with a precious splendour streamed Round her the light of rainbowed stone! The light of rainbowed stone—and gleam Of burning gold, all chased and wrought, Which well the Beauty did beseem,— From whence their fairest light seemed caught!— She led them on with step so fleet, They scarcely might with her keep pace— Hastening, with many-twinkling feet, On shining Pleasure's lightsome chase. She led them on so fleet and fast, Scarcely might they keep pace with her; Casement, and door, and arch, they passed, With busy sound and merry stir. She led them on with step so fleet, So stately and so calm withal, As though she moved on wings—not feet, Swifter, but stiller too than all. With murmuring laugh and whispered word, Breathless they follow on her track; Now for a space more swiftly skirred, And now perforce their pace they slack. The sound of music soon they hear— A joyous and inspiring sound— It softly trembled to the ear, And in the Heart its echo found. When first that sweet sound struck the sense Of her who went the rest before, How glowing with a depth intense, That bright blush reddened more and more! With hues unnatural burned her cheek, With light unnatural blazed her eye; Of strange unrest within they speak, And dazed like meteors flashing by! Now to the last door draw they near, Which shuts them from the joyous scene, She shrinks an instant, as in fear, One moment there doth faultering lean. Then with strong effort—so it seemed, The massive door flung open wide; At once the flood of music streamed Upon them in a swelling tide. Of revelry they catch the sound, But not as yet the inspiring sight, They yet must move a few steps round, Yet a few steps unto the right. But their fair leader trembling stood Awhile—bewildered and distressed; Her comrades in impatient mood, Towards the glad scene impetuous pressed. “On, on!” her gay companions cried, She started—shuddered—smote her breast— With one strong gasp convulsive sighed, Then hurried forward with the rest. They entered that enchanted hall, 'Tis one broad blaze of glowing light— One scene of startling splendour all, 'Tis Fairy-land disclosed to sight. At the upper end, supremely fair, The Queen attracts each raptured eye, All beauteous and all matchless there, In the excellence of Majesty. The diadem that girds her brow Fades near her lustrous eyes' blue light, Yet sparkles on its stainless snow, With beams intolerably bright. Roses must vail their orient heads, The glory of her blush before, That rich blood-royal blush, which spreads Her cheek's transparent smoothness o'er. Aye! the proud royal blood might seem With kingly kindlings—rich and rare, With more than Morning's purple beam To inform her cheek, so clear and fair! As through her veins ran sunshine still— Those regal kindlings brightly spread, Like sun-hues on some crested hill, Crowned with a rich and rosy red. The fair-haired Berengaria there, Attracts all charmed admiring eyes; Amongst the fair supremely fair— Her form all rivalry defies! And one there is that lingereth near, Who looks on her—with charms so rife, As though his soul were fastened here— As though that look alone were life; She spoke to him—to others spoke, Alike with gentlest courtesy, Unchanged he kept that calm fix'd look, As Life and Soul were in his eye. The Queen marked not that earnest gaze, Around with unembarrassed air Her soft blue eye delighted strays; For Fairy-land seems opening there. Proud knights and dames in rich array Meet every where the gladdened eye, Pearls glimmering shine, and white plumes play, And gold and gems flame sparklingly! Banners, and wreaths, and gilded lamps Are clustered in profusion fair; The proud delight no languor damps, No shade of Gloom—no touch of Care. The Queen marks not that deep, deep gaze, And well for him in gazing lost, That Royal Richard elsewhere plays His guests among the part of host! Else haply—stunned with sore amaze— Called to account the knight had been, For this long, long impassioned gaze, On Cœur-de-Lion's matchless Queen! Else haply—with indignant ire— Sir Alberic had admonished been, For fixing thus a gaze of fire On Cœur-de-Lion's beauteous Queen! Now to the royal presence came That little troop—that fairest maid— No faltering fear—no shrinking shame Her calm still countenance betrayed. “Your Royal Grace is angered sore”— Softly began the offending one. Her voice was music—yet before Ne'er poured it forth so sweet a tone. Sharply when first she caught the sound, Albeit so very soft and sweet, The Queen half frowning turned her round The loitering maiden's gaze to meet. But soon that frown so faint and light Melted into the loveliest smile, When burst on her approving sight The maid, who moveless stood the while. “What so! thou honourest thus at last Our royal revel's sorry show— Gramercy! though 'tis well nigh past Its prime and pride of cheer I trow! But I forgive thee, since thou'st come As I could wish, in pomp of charms; Thy cheek ne'er yet wore such a bloom, Thou'rt mailed in Beauty's proudest arms. My carcanet must sure possess Some wond'rous spell—unreck'd before, Like that fair Cestus wont to press Sweet Cytherea's form of yore. I would not have my Lion King, Conqueror of many a famous field, Look on thee now—thou fairest thing, Lest Cœur-de-Lion's self might yield! But for Sir Alberic, hapless wight, The Saints have mercy on his Soul! His heart will ashes be to-night, His Love-struck mind a withered scroll.” “Your Highness is well pleased to-night To banter your poor maiden thus,” Said Britomart, whose cheek so bright Belied her voice so tremulous. “To banter? faith—good damsel, no, In sober seriousness I speak; Ask Countess Maude if 'tis not so, 'Twill raise the crimson on her cheek. Long in your tiring-room you sought To adorn your form with skill and care, And 'tis a miracle you've wrought— Ne'er mortal yet looked half so fair! Now must you dance—no words—you must, Ourself will choose your cavalier: Sir Alberic—to your care we trust This our own favoured damsel dear.” They mingle in the moving maze, Through the gay circles gliding swim— Still on the Queen is fixed his gaze, While her's is faintlier fixed on him. They tread the graceful saraband— Together tread it—fleet and light— Her hand is touched by his cold hand, But she may not enchain his sight. They tread the graceful saraband, Strange show of mirth in mid-despair— Heart breaks for heart—hand thrills to hand, But wildest discord's strife is there. The hand that thrills should pulseless meet That hand by which 'tis faintly held— Those hearts that break, should wiselier beat, Their fevers quenched—their madness quelled. Lightly they tread the measure's maze, Fair youth hath strung each pliant limb, Full on the Queen is fixed his gaze, But hers—is faintlier fixed on him! Oh! Love—what is thy power—thy might? Thou stem'st each shock of adverse Fate Thou grow'st beneath the frost—the blight Thou spring'st beneath a mountain's weight! How can they love, whose hopeless doom Success and joy and peace—denies— Who in their ruined hearts entomb That worm of grief that never dies. How can they love?—Oh! only they Know boundless love in its excess Who pouring all their Souls away Love on in utter hopelessness. They only know Love's rich extremes, Who, free from selfish Hope's alloy, Coin all their Soul to costly dreams, And worship him—apart from joy. They serve not joy—they serve not hope— They serve not worldly vanity— But only bend, and only stoop, Unmerged, unmingled Love! to thee. No prospect fair distracts their view, They nothing know nor see but thee; Thou art to these the vainly true, The world and its immensity! Not to the future may they turn, Their dream createth its own time— No change of Latitudes they learn, Their Soul dwells in its own fixed clime. A proud and prosperous passion soon Forgets its high and heavenly birth, It changeth like the uncertain Moon, Hung 'twixt the eternal Sun and Earth! The hopeless Lover changeth not, Years may he speed o'er wave and hill— 'Tis the same time—and the same spot, In fixedness how faithful still! His Love stands like the unvarying Sun Unlamped—unlighted from without, Continuing as it first begun, Scattering its own rich beams about. Unvarying—and unwearying so, It standeth evermore the same, It shines with self-enkindled glow, Burns with a self-ignited flame! Heap on Earth's surface, huge and high, A forest-pile of fuel strong, And then the blazing torch apply— 'Twill wildly, fiercely, flame and long! Heap, heap the pile—thus huge and high— That forest-mass—the mountain-pile— Till roars the flame against the sky, Blinding the dazzled Earth the while. The assisting currents of the air Shall fan the fiercely fluttering flames, Up to the Firmaments they flare, Aspiring with insatiate aims! The driving winds increase them still, And ample ground and space are given! Around each far-reflecting hill Swells in a cloud of fire to Heaven. But, lo! they waste themselves at last! And waste their fuel's proud supply— Their hour of triumph's rage is past, They waver, languish, sink, and die! So, in the realms of the far West, The crackling forests feed the fire; Earth pants with parched and scorching breast, While roll the blazing billows higher. How can that sea of flame subside? What can its towering surge controul, Till the round world shall be destroyed, And one black wreck of Ruin roll! Some change of wind shall quickly mar The all-mastering terror which it made, Driving the uproarious flames afar— Tho' fierce—tho' strong—yet doomed to fade! Back on their path—the bleak and bare— The spiring columns swiftly shrink; No fuel fresh shall they find there— No aliment—while fast they sink! Or on their dread and daring way They meet some waste and sterile plot, And feebly flutter, faintly play, Until they perish—and are not! Then, where the exulting fires uprose, Even to the thresholds of the sky, No light, no warmth, there cheering glows, They leave grim trophies where they die! Nothing but black and mouldering brands, Ashes and cinders, strew Earth's floor, And the round World, uninjured, stands On its foundations as before! Mark, where in the Earth's own deepest heart Volcanic heats are gendered still, That seldom to the surface start— Long slumbering—as with patient will. Where in the Earth's entrails, lone and deep, Volcanic heats are smouldering still, Save when they startle from their sleep, And rear, and rend the cratered hill! There lives and lasts, for age on age, The fiery element sublime, Hiding its hot and haughty rage For centuries of wide-circling Time. It doth not perish nor decline— Shrouded in silence and in gloom— The treasure of a burning mine— The slumberer of a smouldering tomb! It doth not perish nor decay— Unseen—unreck'd—and unknown, It doth not waste its strength away— Its shadowy realm is all its own. It lasts, it lives, nor doth decline, Sealed up in silence and in gloom; The mammon of a burning mine, The tenant of a smouldering tomb! Soon shall sink low the Funeral pyre— The outshining Beacon's blaze shall fail— Pale—faint—shall fade the Victory-fire— The Forest's conflagrations—pale. But in the depths of silent Earth The fountains of the eternal flame Shall play as at their secret birth, Nor swiftly wane, nor languish tame! So Love's pent, prisoned flames shall glow, Shrouded from air and hid from day— The surface of the Soul below— So shall its burning fountains play! E'en so shall play its burning founts— So shall its deathless fire remain, Which seldom to the surface mounts— Or if it doth, soon shrinks again! Not so the love, that, free and light, By some chance spark called forth, appears, Not nursed in silence and in night— Through long, and dark, and troubled years. But fanned at once into a blaze By favouring winds and fluttering airs, Scattered and spread a hundred ways— Quickened by smiles, vows, sighs, and prayers. Awhile a shining front it rears, And triumphs on its glowing way— No check, no obstacle appears— How should it alter or decay? But if for some brief space, perchance, Unfanned, unfuelled, 'tis left free, When once it ceaseth to advance, How soon it ceaseth too to be! Unfanned, unfuelled, and unfed— How soon its meteor-spires drop low; Its spires—faint dying sparks instead, Soon shrink—soon these forget to glow! Or by some varying breath of air, Some changing current on its track, 'Tis checked and hindered, thwarted, there, And driven along its own course back! What finds it there to feed its flame? Ah! the fair growths of summer's hour, These blush, and flourish not the same; They've felt its touch, and known its power! All perishable things and fair, Not made to endure, not formed to last, They are vanished—they are no longer there— It caught and scathed them as it passed! Where spread the bowers, all fresh and green, To lend a rich luxuriant shade, 'Tis all a waste and sterile scene— A ruin and a desert made! The bloom of Eden—flowers and trees— These things are vanished and no more; How sweetly to the sun and breeze They laughed in pleasure's pride before! Elysian thoughts! the enchanting dreams!— With all their bright and blushing train, These fade, while brief their triumph seems, And Love shall find them not again. Retracing his own former way, What finds he there—what wealth in store? But scattered ashes—dust and clay!— Ashes and dust!—no more! no more! The fairy gifts are fled away, Withered the flowery wreaths of bloom— Consumed the vernal trophies gay, And darkness frowns around, and doom. Such Love, retracking its own course, Shall miss its transient treasures there, And lose its power, and lose its force, Finding its pathway bleak and bare. 'Tis hopeless Love that ever lives Concealed within the heart's deep core; Time but to this fresh vigour gives— 'Tis ever deepening more and more. (Oh! Love, what miseries dost thou bring, Thyself Earth's heavenliest happiness, Whence dost thou steal that venomed sting, And whence that scourge of stern distress?) Deep, deep within the bosom's cell, Concealed, and buried, and unknown, That Love doth never changing dwell, In gloomy triumph, lost and lone! Aye! like volcanic fires, veiled there, Dost thou unquenchably remain, And still the same deep fervours share, The same unmastered strength retain. And if disclosed for some brief space, In all the mystery of thy might, What doth the eye recoiling trace!— What burning secrets shock the sight!— One black and boiling gulph of gloom Appears the scorched and blasted breast— Passion's fierce cradle and its tomb, Where Peace may never be a guest! Some burst of anguish chance reveals— Those ghastly mysteries of its pain— One dread convulsion's shock unseals, Another shrouds it up again! But still it burns—for ever burns, Unchanged, unchangeably the same, Nor wane, nor diminution learns— The enshrouded, but eternal Flame! It burns—nor knoweth to decline, In caverned and sepulchral gloom, The treasure of a kindled mine, The slumberer of a smouldering tomb. No blazing suns, no favouring airs, Encourage or increase its strength, But it shall last till Ruin tears Its temple from its base at length! Return we to the illumined hall, And to that doomed and matchless pair, Fairest and stateliest there of all— Most wretched and most hopeless there! Sir Alberic and fair Britomart, Who moved with proud and peerless grace— Despair and death in either heart, But calmness in each cloudless face! They moved 'midst plaudits still and praise, Fair features scowled with Envy grim!— But on the Queen was fixed his gaze, And Britomart's was fixed on him! They finished then the lengthened dance, For them, save one spot, all is dim; Still to the Queen is turned his glance, Still Britomart's is turned to him! To royal Berengaria then, Beckoned by her own snowy hand, They back retrace their steps again, And by their Sovereign Ladye stand! They stand before great England's Queen— As proud and beautiful a pair As e'er admiring eye hath seen, Where knights are proud—and dames are fair! She stands there, almost hid in light Of starry beauty, strangely fair, That darts and deepens on the sight, Till none can steadfastly gaze there. Her eyes with kindling lustres stream, Like splendours of a thousand stars! When all with separate glories gleam, And not one cloud their triumph mars. The smooth transparence of her cheek With one rich hue consummate glows— That glorious, gorgeous, scarlet streak, Which shames the heart-blush of the rose! Meandering o'er her forehead fine, The purple veins play smoothly laced, In many a branching serpentine, Too deeply, too distinctly traced. Yes—yes! too prominent and clear, Those veins in their blue beauty lie, Too swoln and throbbing these appear, For gladness or tranquillity. Poor maiden! never yet hast thou Looked half so glorious or so fair, So brilliant or so bright as now, 'Tis fever—madness—anguish—there! 'Tis that which lights thy restless eye With flames and lustres yet unknown, And gives thy cheek its dazzling dye, To shame the orient rose full blown! 'Tis that thy burning cheek that stains Vermillion, of the brightest hues, And swells and fires those purple veins, Which lightning-streams seem racing through! T'is that which lifts thy lovely form, To more than maiden dignity, So the wild Spirit of the Storm Seems to dilate the o'er-troubled sky! They stood before great England's Queen, The stateliest 'midst that concourse fair, And never eye beheld, I ween, A prouder or a princelier pair! Both were of far-famed lineage high, And kingly blood flowed in their veins, Of proud and princely ancestry, Whose stamp their aspect still retains. And he in manhood's prime of pride, Was cast in Nature's noblest mould, In England's lordly realms and wide No finer frame could eye behold. Though marble-pale his perfect face Those dark blue eyes no brilliance lack; His brow spreads arched with loftiest grace, Where waves rich hair of death-deep black! They stood before great England's Queen, Herself the fairest of the fair, And vision could not rest, I ween, Upon a loftier lovelier pair! “Well danced!—well done!—from first to last, Chevalier preux, and damosel— To-night ye have yourselves surpassed, Your parts ye have performed right well. Methinks the mazes of the dance More cunningly no steps might thread, Eftsoons ye may resume perchance— And yet a livelier measure tread. Thou art not wearied, Britomart, Thy cheek but wears a richer bloom— Now would I speak with thee apart, If thou canst leave thy gallant groom.” These last few words here whispered low In the stung ear of the anguished maid; Soft were they whispered—soft and slow— She starts—she trembles—sore dismayed. “Nay, maiden! never look aghast, Because thy dearest prayers are heard, Because thy hopes are crowned at last— Come, come! with you we claim one word. Unto the King this very night, Myself will speak—without delay— He'll hail the tidings with delight! And he shall fix the auspicious day! Thou knowest thy noble parents said, When thou didst join our household train, That whom we willed that thou shouldst wed, The same their free consent should gain. The bridal cheer—the bridal feast Full quickly now shall we command; Our own Confessor—worthy Priest— Shall give Sir Alberic this fair hand. But why!—what ails thee, maiden, now? The colours fast thy cheek forsake, 'Tis whiter than thy very brow— What makes thee start, and shrink, and shake? With what strange fancies art possessed? What vain caprice now rules thy mind? They're right who swear that woman's breast Is fickle as the inconstant wind. I see!—I see—some other love Now dwells enthroned within your heart, Think not that I shall deign reprove— Your conscience points the unworthy part! Your weal still occupied my thought, I ever stood your firmest friend— By day and night untired I sought To atchieve the one most wished for end— And now when not a doubt remains, When all this Youth's devotion see, I find as guerdon for my pains Thy false and foul inconstancy.” Thus the fair Queen with kindling eyes, Sparkling with indignation's fire!— Her hasty wrath is prompt to arise, And evermore as prompt to expire! From Childhood, courted and obeyed, Circled by troops of flatterers still, She seldom checked and seldom stayed The promptings of her headstrong will. “Well, Damsel—well!—we leave thee now Without reproach—without reproof; Bethink thee well ere thou avow Such wavering moods beneath our roof.” She turned away with wrathful mien, With scorn and anger to depart— While flashed her eyes with fire—“My Queen! Dread Queen!”—said hapless Britomart. “My Queen!” said hapless Britomart, “My wretched fate is fixed and sealed, And every dream of his high heart Is to my tortured sight revealed! Grief was a cold uneasy Love, Morose and jealous and severe— Even Constancy might well remove From her stern worship—dull and drear. The gentle sleeper in the tomb, So loved, so worshipped—he forgot, Won by the charms of living bloom, But mine those conquering charms were not! Faithless he proved unto the Dead, And faithless now must ever prove; For Memory-light is faintly shed Where burns the fire of living love! But not for me—Oh! not for me, Another warmed his raptured heart!— He loves—with wildest fervency— But, Oh! he loves not Britomart!” The Queen looked on that maiden pale With grieved, surprised, and wildered look, And while she listened to the tale, Her wrath a new direction took! The Queen looked on that maiden pale, Whose cheek, each glowing tint forsook; And while she listened to the tale, Her ire a fresh direction took! “Now! by the Holy Rood!” she cried, “We scarce may credit what thou 'st said— Is he not ever at thy side, Like one that wooes and fain would wed? Doth he not ever shun the crowd, And mingle in our royal train? The which we alway have allowed, Because we hoped he wore thy chain. Because we hoped and well believed He wore thy chain and owned thy charm. Maiden, 'tis thou must be deceived, 'Tis sure some jealous fond alarm. Thee, thee, we meant that he should love, How dares he love another then? Where hath he found this turtle dove, Where hath he found this maid, and when? Certes, 'tis one of mine own train, None other ever wins his glance; But we can tell him 'tis in vain, He yet may ask our will perchance! Thee, thee, we meant that he should love, How dares he on another look! Our power that other shall remove— Must we these treasonous insults brook? Tell me this chosen fair one's name, Is't Countess Maude?—is't Lady May? Tell me at once the favourite dame Who makes him thus to disobey! Is't silent Constance, shy and sly, Constance de Courtenay—wan and white, With roseless cheek, and starless eye, Yet fair and fairy-like, and slight? Or is't the sparkling Leonore, With laughing lip and winning wiles, Whose brow no shadow ever bore, A cloudless sky of ceaseless smiles? Or dark eyed Ladye Geraldine? Or quiet Agnes, meek and mild? Or fair Florise, of lofty line, The warlike Percy's only child? Or Mistress Rose—smooth-cheeked and sleek, The blackest eye, the merriest mien, The reddest lip, the rosiest cheek, In all our courtly train I ween? Or Lilias, with her flaxen locks, Like threads of aëry gossamere, And skin that stainless ivory mocks, So white and delicate—and clear? Or gentle, gentlest Ladye Clare, A thing all harmony and light, So still we know not she is there, A presence sweet—a vision bright? Or is't that black browed Marguerite, From the French Monarch's noble court, She of the fairy flying feet, Of taper shape, and stature short? Or is't that fair romantic maid, Pale Ursula, with downcast eyes, Who ever seeks the enfolding shade, And sits in her lone bower and sighs? Which is't, poor Britomart, of these, Which, which has stol'n his heart from thee? Which may his wayward fancy please, Ah! which his chosen fair may be? I have forgotten stately Grace, And pretty Mistress Madeline— But not one form, and not one face, Of these can dare the match with thine! Not one of these might ever dare To match with thee in form or face, Unless 'twere gentlest Ladye Clare, And she is absent from her place. I scarce, in sooth, his choice might blame, Were she the object of that choice! All hearts adore that lovely Dame, A gentle vision and a voice. A visitant she ever seems From the Orbs of blessed Souls on high— So from her Angel-aspect beams The light and peace of yon far sky. If her it was—but her 'tis not, Not lately hath she here been seen— But had she dwelt upon the spot, A dangerous rival she had been. But tell me, maiden, tell me now, If that thou know'st—tell who it is, At once the mournful truth avow— Or is it that—or is it this?” Wildly gazed Britomart around— “Nay, urge me not, great Queen, I pray, By honour, pity, justice bound, His secret I may scarce betray. My gracious Liege! but urge me not, 'Twere useless all—well, well, I know, Better passed o'er, unknown, forgot, That bitter source of boundless woe! Suffice that she he loves is one Whom never more will he behold, Whose presence he but seeks to shun, With misery and despair untold. But think not she in form or mind, In vermeil bloom or peerless grace, May e'er in sooth a rival find, Matchless is she in Soul and face! When snowdrops pale surpass the rose, She then may faulter, then may fear; When the great Sun a rival knows, May she be shaken in her sphere!” “With jealousy's misjudging eyes, Poor child! you look!” the Queen replied, This still distorts or magnifies With wrong impressions still allied. Trust to my judgment, better far Mine eyes unprejudiced may mark The aspect of this living star, That shines o'er your faint Soul and dark!” “Nay, urge me not great Queen, vouchsafe To let this secret buried rest; Nor let thy princely spirit chafe, With generous Anger's zeal possessed.” “Anger! methinks this business well Might stir the choler of a saint; And know, mine ire I scarce can quell, To mark thy yielding spirit faint! Up, rouse ye! Maid—this recreant knight, This vain deceiver, vile and base, At once should in thy breast excite Hatred—in fervent feeling's place! Forget this stain to knighthood now, Or learn to abhor him, and to scorn! And chase each shadow from thy brow, Nor pine in abject mood forlorn.” “Nay, royal Mistress, deign but hear, No recreant knight, nor base is he; His name and fame are bright and clear As any in the realm may be! He ne'er hath wronged me, nor aggrieved, What right had I his heart to claim? He ne'er hath mocked me, ne'er deceived, I may not noble Alberic blame.” “But I may,” in impatient tone, The regal Berengaria cried; “Ne'er yet was more devotion shown, He lived but only at thy side! He seemed but in thy sight to live, The whole court marked thee for his bride! If this thou canst indeed forgive, Poor thou'rt in spirit, poor in pride!” “He deemed I pierced and pitying knew The heavy secret of his heart; A stainless knight is he and true,” Still faultered forth poor Britomart. “Well, rouse ye—rouse ye now to brook These ills of fortune undismayed, And cast aside the mourner's look, And be thy face in smiles arrayed. At least it is not worth thy while To pine in sorrow for his sake— Recall thy bloom—repair thy smile, And these unworthy fetters break. But if thou wilt with stubborn will For his sake pine and moan and sigh, Then let us seek some method still To shake his foolish constancy. He yet may by thy charms be won, Yet taught thy gentle worth to prize, Nor longer look indifferent on The lustre of those loving eyes! He yet may, as he changed before, (As we well know and must avow) Change, and with right good cause once more, And turn from her who rules him now! Never!—the damsel shuddering said, I hope—I think—I dream it not, Ne'er till he's numbered with the dead Shall his new passion be forgot. Never! from such fond dreams apart I seek to keep my busy brain; I look into my own bruised heart, And know such hope were worse than vain!” “Howe'er this be,” the princely dame In soothing tone rejoined once more, “Bear on with smooth-cleared brow the same, Nor show thy hope thy peace is o'er! Discard that pale hue from thy face, Resume thy buoyancy and bloom, Bear thee as may become thy race, As may thy noble self become. Fair prospects smile thine eyes before, Thou yet shalt grace a lofty place; Say not, nor deem thy hope is o'er, Thou yet shalt Joy's light paths retrace! Dear child! it yet shall be thy fate A high and happy place to fill, To shine and bloom in fair estate, Though now thy heart with anguish thrill. As for this Knight, I 'gin to doubt 'Twere best he weds his Ladye-love! Since (senseless loon—and sightless lout!) Thou'rt sure he'll ne'er thy suitor prove.” “His Ladye-love he nee'r may wed, His love is hopeless as mine own! Till both are numbered with the dead, No peace for either may be known.” “Now grant me patience,” sharply cried The Queen, incensed with sudden ire, Good sooth, I am too sorely tried, An angel's patience well might tire! Whoever dealt with ideots twain, So obstinate and weak before?— It rubs the temper, 'gainst the grain, And tries the hasty nature sore! Both are resolved to fling away Their chance of happiness and peace; Both will a part insensate play, Will such blind folly never cease? The dame he loves then, loves him not, Then why, in name of all the saints! Doth he not strive to amend his lot, And hush his weak and vain complaints? Why doth he not then turn to thee, And seek sweet Consolation's balm? The shipwrecked mariner at sea Welcomes the refuge and the calm! Those wan chang'd looks should melt and move, If his a heart of flesh may be— He sees your sufferings and your love— How, how can he unsoftened see?” “Nay, gracious Madam, say not so! He knows not that my heart is his; May Heaven forefend he e'er should know A truth so sad and vain as this.” “He knows it not?—now breaks a light Upon this troubled clouded scene, But let me tell him this to-night, To-morrow's sky shall smile serene!” “Dread Sovereign!” cried she, in faint tone, Clasping her hands in suppliant guise, “Forbear!” If this indeed be done, Your mocked and shame-stung maiden dies!” “Forget him, then! and shew e'en so Some worthy and beseeming pride; 'Tis no o'erpowering loss, I trow, The realm is peopled, and 'tis wide. 'Tis no irreparable loss! That thou shouldst pine thy livelong life; Thy ringlets must not lose their gloss— Thine eye its gleam, from this vain strife!— Nor thy rose lip its smiling curve, For such a petty cause—no! no! More gallant knights shall yet deserve, The blush and smile of lip and brow! Our England's flower of chivalry— The flower of Christendom we count! Clear flow the stainless waves, and free, From honour's own transcendant fount. 'Mongst these, my Britomart!—'mongst these, Thou yet mayst well and fairly find Some noble youth to touch and please, To melt thy heart and suit thy mind!” “My Queen, I have on earth no hope, Save in the cloistered virgin's veil; With this harsh world no more I cope, Completed is my heavy tale.” “The veil! on that canst thou be bent? Maiden! I tell thee now 'tis vain; Never shalt thou win our content, Thou surely bearest not thy sound brain! 'Tis madness, folly—worse than these— 'Tis obstinacy's mood perverse: Wouldst break, then, with the first light breeze That shakes the hopes thou'st willed to nurse? Full many gallant knights resort, (Of proud renown, and bravery high,) To Cœur-de-Lion's royal court, Himself the pride of chivalry! I tell thee, damsel, many a one! What think'st thou of that stalworth Knight— Hetheringtonshaugh of Wilderington, Ever the foremost in the fight? True, at our princely tournament, By brave Sir Alberic's conquering arm His helm was cleft, his lance was bent, Himself was stunned with rueful harm! But ofttimes hath he charged his shield, With augmentation high and proud! In many a Saracenic field His prowess hath been well avowed. Or, haply Ralph, of Borthwick town, Yet better, Maiden, may thee like, Whose hand, though youthful as thine own, A desperate blow at need can strike! The King himself saith such an one He ne'er saw dealt by stripling wight, And his especial grace is shewn To this most hopeful valiant Knight! Or wilt thou cast more favouring eye On young De Ros, that Baron bold, Who from a noble stock doth rise— And well his honours high shall hold. Or on that proudest of his peers, The gallant Lord of Arundel, Who broad his snow-white standard rears, And brooks his coal-black charger well! Or, may be, on that youthful Earl, Flushed with the old Santo Mauro pride, With falcon eye and raven curl— For him thoud'st make a dainty Bride!” “My gracious Ladye—but forbear— Your words like poisoned daggers pierce, For Ruth's sweet sake I pray thee spare— These are sharp pangs and tortures fierce!” “Like poisoned daggers?—many a maid Had said like honeyed flatteries sweet; But I will not be checked nor stayed, So list in patient mood discreet.” Thou yet shalt thank me, when o'erpast This first wild burst of grief may be, And own with grateful sense at last, How true a friend I proved to thee.” “Most mighty Princess! never yet Hath heart more grateful throbb'd below— I know, I feel the unmeasured debt Which I to thy large bounty owe! But never may this hand of mine In love's true mutual plight be given— My doom is fixed, and my design— No bride—except the Bride of Heaven! My cheek already—mortal woe— Doth blaunche and blight with ashen stain; To convent shade 'tis meet I go, To hide my bloom's swift early wane.” “Tut! witless lass!” the Princess said, “Thy bloom, my word for 't, soon again Will o'er thy cheek as fairly spread, And well replace Grief's ashen stain! No convent pile shall thee receive, In flourished bower and gilded hall Thy place shall be, I well believe, Where thou shalt fairest shine of all.” “My place must be where pavement worn By suppliant knees, day after day, Glints back the lamp-light shed forlorn, O'er skulls and cross-bones' grim array. For me—for me—be veil and vest Of gloomy flow, and unadorned— The meetest garments and the best For all who mourn, or e'er have mourned! For me be bead, and book, and bell, And lonely watch and vigils late, And cloistered court and coffined cell, And ghostly guide and glimmering grate. For gilded chamber—casement gay— Chancel and charnel shall be mine, Where solemn shadows brooding stray, And the embered tomb, the reliqued shrine! The dim and image-holding niche, Rosary, and crucifix, and hood— Away with broidered garments rich, They ill assort with Sorrow's mood.” “Peace, idle tattler!—dreamer, peace!” Then interposed the royal dame, “Prithee, let this wild rambling cease, Nor force me now to chide and blame. Ere twice twelve months were passed and o'er I wot thou shouldst full sorely rue, And vainly, vainly set more store On things that now offend thy view! And thou'lt not be the first who long Have lived to weep their rash, weak deed, When smit by heavy fortune's wrong, They willed the nun's dull life to lead. Beware, poor foolish child, beware, Or thou wilt wretched, wretched be; Thou may'st not know what dark despair Should haply thus be stored for thee. Thou'rt new to sorrow and to pain— But, trust my words, if thou but seek Bravely to bear the yoke and chain, The chain shall melt, the yoke shall break. The elastic spirits of thine age Shall yet up spring, fresh, glad, and wild, Myself am scarce a matron sage, But thou'rt a sixteen summered child. If thou, indeed, would'st still incline, Some little time retired to dwell, Thou shalt thy parents dear rejoin Until once more thou'rt blythe and well. To them I will my maiden spare For one fair month and for a day, Nor doubt the keen Northumbrian air Will blow thy little grief away. Where the old Northumbrian mountains rise I know your noble kin reside, I know their stately castle lies By the Tyne river's peaceful tide. And well I wot that native air, So fresh, so clear, so keen, and wild, Shall bring the health-bloom fine and fair Back to the mountain's gentle child.” “Madam, on bended knee I thank Thy gracious thought and kind intent: But all my future is a blank, On convent-life my Soul is bent! I would not wish to view again The hills—the streams belov'd of old, 'Twould but augment the anguish'd pain Which stings my bosom's inmost fold. Clear flows that river's chrystal tide, As when I wandered blythe and free, Its azure-rolling wave beside, In Maiden mirth, or Childhood's glee. But I, alas the while! my Soul In turbid flow now learns to run, Its restless billows fiercely roll, And shadows o'er it darkle dun. Those hills as proudly gladly rise, Kissed by the sunbeam—crest and base, And soar into the smiling skies, But I am rooted from my place! I would not,—not for worlds—retread The paths I knew in former days— No! let me lay my wearied head Where hope beguiles not, nor betrays! Where Memory's self may haply sleep, Expelled by thoughts of heavenly worth, And where to suffer and to weep, May be to escape the thralls of Earth. Each calm hour there shall have its prayer, Its day its holy duty dear— To mourn shall be to mount up—there, Unto a higher purer sphere! Ah! me—I long to taste that calm, I long to breathe that peaceful air; For anguish there is still a balm— Where stands Heaven's shrine of grace—'tis there! To some still nunnery's hallowed pile, With firm unfaltering step I go— Ah! those who can no longer smile Should let their tears in secret flow! One grief indeed remains behind, One bitter pang—till now untried, One cruel throe for heart and mind— To quit my Gracious Sovereign's side. My Royal Mistress' roof to leave, From her loved presence to depart; This, this indeed will pain and grieve, And wound the already wounded heart. But it must be—my Spirit yearns Itself to dedicate to Heaven; My broken Spirit trembling turns From Life's fell scene and fiery sweven! 'Tis sinful, sinful thus to love, And sinful, sinful thus to mourn— Unless we teach this grief to prove A martyr's crown of blessed thorn. Unless we turn to Heavenly use The sorrows of our souls betimes, And seek the World's vain ties to loose, And shun its follies and its crimes. Unless for Heavenly aid we seek, And plume our leaden thoughts at length, Through steadfast will, yet mild and meek, To soar in Heaven-lent skyward strength.” “Not so, dear maid! yet, yet not so! At least, not in that mode thou mean'st— 'Midst Life's wild billows' changeful flow, Stands strong that rock on which thou lean'st. Deem'st thou indeed that thou must fly To nunnery-gloom and convent-shade— To find the assistance from on high— The light that cannot change nor fade? Our Holy Ladye's presence bless'd Can light through mists and shadows dart, Her shrine's—the consecrated breast! Her gift—the dedicated heart! Amidst the crowded city's maze, As in the quiet convent's calm— The pious soul can pour forth praise, And earn the blessing and the balm.” “Great Queen! these words in wisdom flow, Yet, yet I feel this chastisement, This trial sharp—this bitter woe— Was on no trivial errand sent. The impetuous spirit—warm and wild, Too eager Life's strange race to run, If 'twould be pure and undefiled— Doth well Temptation's paths to shun. Even such is mine, too wild—too weak— In this world's maze too quickly lost! Oh! should I sagely do to seek In fragile bark a dangerous coast? The grief that doth so keenly gall, That on my suffering spirit preys, I feel 'tis an especial call— My Soul to win from worldly ways.” “Nay, Maiden, nay, thy dreamy brain Frames many a flitting phantasy: Thus troubled and confused with pain, And rack'd by thoughts still hurrying by. Wait but awhile and thou shalt find How Time can change thy view of things, That great physician of the mind, That counsellor who wisdom brings! I will not press, not urge thee yet To mingle in the courtly throng, Await till soothed be thy regret, And calmed thy grief—'twill not be long! I prophecy 'twill not be long, For griefs thus vehement are short— Await awhile—then, midst the throng Shine forth—the fairest of my court!” “Now, royal mistress!—gracious friend, Hearken to thy poor maiden's prayer— Thy patience unto her extend, That thus to oppose thy will may dare.” “Peace! I command thee! peace—and hear What I would yet to thee unfold; To me thou ever wert most dear— And dear I thee must ever hold! If after twelve swift months are fled Thou yet dost full and firm maintain This wild resolve, to which thou'rt wed, I will not seek thy will to enchain. Remain till then, still at my side, I have no passing doubt nor fear, That thus, well pondered, fairly tried, Thy wish shall dream-like disappear. And thou shalt give that little hand As guerdon for some valourous knight, The pride, the flower of English land, Born to win favour in thy sight! Aye—this first love shall fade away As the earliest blossoms of the year, And wreaths of joy shall cluster gay Around thy path—wreaths never sere! Again at banquet and at ball, In gilded bower and dazzling court, Shalt thou be lightest heart of all, And sport and smile in 'customed sort. Thou shalt at princely chase of deer, And falconry's inspiring game, Take part in all the jocund cheer, With many another merry dame. And at the noble joust, where feat Of arms is done full warlike wise, Shalt thou look on from high-raised seat, And feast on doughty deeds thine eyes. Didst thou observe last tilting-day A youthful Knight of promise rare, With proudly panached helm and gay, Of bearing bold and presence fair? 'Twas young Sir Hugh de Mowbray, sprung From knightly Sires of high renown; Success unto his arms still clung, And twice he bore his brave foe down! He is a gallant spirit free, To death they are dight who check at him, And many a follower bold hath he, Of dauntless heart and stalworth limb. He is the lord of broad fair lands, And his proud state rare trophies deck, And many a vassal round him stands, To do his bidding and his beck. They say not oft such sight is seen As these—his yeomen, stern of mood, With six feet bows and boar spears keen, And quivers stocked, and broadswords good. 'Tis said the happiest serfs by far Are his on merry English land, For hot and fiery in the war, In peace he is full mild and bland. And generous too, and free withal, The joy of all the country round; High feasting crowns his ancient hall, And every vassall there is found. Happy the woman who shall wed This noble lord of proud estate! I say no more—what I have said I would might have some worthy weight! But, Britomart! hast thou ne'er yet Looked gentlier on that far-famed knight, On whom all eyes and hearts are set, Eustace de Montmorency hight? Know'st thou they say, that for his love A royal Princess long hath grieved, And late hath sent her broidered glove To be by him her knight received. Wherefore 'tis thought—ere long will he Break for her sake a lance in fight, And challenge England's chivalry, Charged by her hest, to do her right. But yet 'tis known he still doth swear His English heart and English hand Shall ne'er be giv'n to foreign fair, But some bright Ladye of the land. Sweet Countess Maude some hope retains To tame this Lion of the War; Some think he yet will wear her chains, Methinks I know a likelier far. Geoffrey and Guy are brothers bold Of Neville's high and haughty race, Of princely mind and knightly mould, And well the foe they front and face. Each seeks a bride, and pelf and power I wot belongs to them in sooth, And she in lofty state may tower, Who weds with either lordly youth. For County Claude with coal-black hair, From sunny Provence' smiling shore, To him thy hand I might not spare— Thou shalt not cross the channel o'er! But one there is, who more than all Deserves that little hand of thine, The pride of court and field and hall, Earl Jocelyn of thine own proud line. Thy gallant cousin—more, far more,” But here she stayed, nor farther said, A messenger bends low before The Queen, to announce the banquet's spread. Her royal train now gathers round, And with all seeming pomp she moves To where the supper board is crowned With choicest cates that taste approves. There, on a splendid chair of state Fair Berengaria takes her seat, And round that sovereign chair there wait Proud nobles tendering service meet. The proudest 'midst that noble band, Sir Alberic de Mounteagle stood, The very flower of English land, Of loftiest bearing—noblest blood. The pallid hue—deep suffering's trace, Which erst his countenance obscured, Hath left it since he took his place His peers among, and grief abjured. Youth's bright blood mantles in his cheek, Youth's ardour flashes in his eye, Still something doth to-night bespeak Strange absence of tranquility. Two moments looks he not the same, His aspect changeth evermore, Yet still that eye was full of flame, That brow its flush deep kindling wore. With panached cap in hand low drooped, He stood, the regal chair beside, That cap one blinding diamond looped, And peerless was its plume's white pride. His cloak of purple velvet piled, With fur of martin wild was bound; And well I ween 'twas matchless styled By many a whisp'ring dame around! His crimson vest of satin sheen Glistered and wavered in the light; His gold-sheathed sword—good blade and keen— Hung from a blazoned bauldric bright. Blythe speeds the banquet—mirth and glee Around the festive board abound, And healths are pledged full merrily— Each cup with foaming wine is crowned. Yet by that Princely Presence graced, Through that fair company's gay crowd, A due restraint might well be traced, Nor rose the laugh unseemly loud. No blyther aspect eye might mark Than gallant young Sir Alberic's there, Dashed from his brow his hair waved dark, Waved as 'twere swept by breezy air. That brow seemed stamped by no deep thought, No shadow seemed thereon to rest, Within sure no dark fancies wrought, No care abode—unwelcome guest! Wild smiles around his lip still played, For ever freshly wreathed—played bright; No passing cloud, no flitting shade, Dimmed those glad smiles of sunny light. He seemed most joyous of that band, And yet his lip no bright wine quaffed— He grasped no goblet in his hand, But still refused the sparkling draught. No shining wine-cup foamed for him, He bade the wassail bowl to pass! He kissed no goblet's sparkling brim Of malvoisie or hypocrasse. A draught of fire 'twas his to drain, A deadly and pernicious bowl, A draught of passion and of pain, Maddening the roused and desperate Soul! The boiling currents in his veins Raged e'en like streams of liquid flame! That draught delirious which he drains Maddens and tortures mind and frame! Yet gaily smiled he evermore, As though no poignant griefs he knew, Right gallantly himself he bore That hour of sharpest trial through. Music's delicious strains were heard, With richest stops and cadence sweet— Sweet as Love's gently whispered word, When soft assent the lips repeat. Fair speeds the banquet, blythe and fair, And all are glad and proudly gay, And not a sorrow nor a care Might seem one bosom there to sway. Blythe speeds the banquet, blythe and fair, And joyous are the festive crowd, And still the brow most sunny there Is young Sir Alberic's, brave and proud. To him, indeed, the beauteous Queen Scarce spoke—or when she did, 'twas still With head averted—altered mien— And air displeased, and grave, and chill. Upon her glorious forehead fair There brooded dim Wrath's lowering frown, And her bright countenance did wear A shade—which it might seldom own. Her lip—so beautiful with smiles, Wears a slight scornful semblance now, Forgets to-night its rosy wiles, Though still curved fair, like Cupid's bow. The feast is done, the guests prepare To part from that enchanted scene, And many a gentle damsel fair Departs reluctant thence, I ween. Amidst the hurry and the crowd Sir Alberic comes once more to accost Pale Britomart, with anguish bowed, Most like some fleeting sheeted ghost. They met in gloomy calmness there, No more had they to hear or tell— He whispered, “Maiden, pure and fair, Vouchsafe to admit this last farewell.” Then death-cold lip on death-cold hand A frozen, freezing kiss impressed, So ice-barred wave on snow-piled strand, Might cheerlessly and chilling rest! Then death-white hand by death-white lip Was touched with faultering kiss and faint; So, in the wake of some proud ship, Meet foam-wreathes white, no flush may paint. Within the heart of both was death, And the worst blackness of despair; Her troubled reason faultereth, And he, like wretch condemned, droops there. Soon turned he rapidly away, And uttered farther word to none; Nor reverence due he paused to pay To the bright Queen of England's throne. He turned indeed,—e'en as he past, Afar, one distant view to gain— One look,—his longest and his last!— Then forth he fared—with phrenzied brain. Then forth he fared with breaking heart And wildered mind—by grief undone, And what of thee, pale Britomart?— She bends a broken-hearted one! But unto woe and pain resigned, No murmur from her lip is heard; With look composed and constant mind She breathes no plaint, no sigh, no word. Unto her chamber dim she hies, And kneels for hours with hidden face, Then, all outwearied, down she lies, And slumbers for some little space! The cock hath crowed, the morn hath broke— Fair morn, most sweet and blessed time! Earth springs from darkness' crushing yoke, And light once more leaps forth sublime. The cock hath crowed, the morn hath broke, Shadows and glooms all melt away; Thousands upon that morning woke To hail the new and busy day. And thousands on that smiling morn, (Fair kindling in that brightening sky,) Were to this world of trouble born, Launched on life's ocean—fearlessly! And thousands on that morn, I ween, With laboured groan and long-drawn sigh, Prepared to quit this earthly scene, Prepared with fainting Soul to die. The cock hath crowed, the morn hath broke, The city's dwellers rise betimes, And curls the city's wreathed smoke, Even to the unshadowed sky it climbs! The morn hath broke—a fine fair morn, The first of March—cold Month and free— That lusty Month that seems to scorn To traverse Earth impetuously. Forth from the uprising city fares A coarse-clad pilgrim—lorn and lone— The freshening cheering morning airs In vain o'er his pale front have blown. Pale looks his forehead, white his lip, His tall slight form seems bowed and bent, With leathern bottle and with scrip, He journeys on with high intent. Unto the Holy Land he's bound— Borne on Devotion's strengthening wing, Thence—when long rolling months come round, Palm-branch and relique shall he bring. Budget and staff and scrip hath he, The scollop shell his cap doth deck, His sandal shoon with latchets see, And crucifix hung round his neck. Upon his mantle black were traced In scarlet cloth, Saint Peter's keys— Conspicuous on his shoulders placed— That mantle's sole adornment these. But though his garb's adornment's small, Rugged and coarse, and homely seen, Show me 'mongst England's nobles all A nobler or a haughtier mien. But though that form be bent and bowed, As 'twere beneath ill fortune's storm, Match me amongst the knightly crowd That lofty and that stately form. And though beneath his cowl so dark, His front be pale and shadow'd o'er— I ween no watchful eye might mark A front that loftier semblance bore. He turns not to the left nor right, But bears straight forward on his way, No busy sound, no cheering sight Can tempt him for a moment stay. In pilgrim garments coarse and poor, He passes on—sans doubt or dread, The kindly housewife at her door Prays for a blessing on his head. The frolick children in his path Awhile suspend their shout and laugh, And look with awe on him who hath The shallop shell, and scrip, and staff. The youthful maids cast sidelong glance At those fine sculptured features pale; But o'er that moveless countenance Seems mystery drawn like some deep veil. On, on—he turneth not aside, One path hath he—one aim, one end; Still fares he on with measured stride, Poor Pilgrim! thee may saints befriend! Ere to the Holy Land thou'rt come, With hardship and with travel bent, I wot thy dearest friend at home Should know thee not—wayworn and spent. Thy thread-bare mantle scarce shall serve To keep thee from the weather's blight, And wearied shalt thou bend and swerve, Beneath light scrip's and budget's weight! Thy long grown locks and matted beard Shall well that sharpened face disguise, And scorch'd shall be that brow, and sear'd And haggard wild thy deep sunk eyes. Poor Pilgrim! long and rough thy way, But cheer thee with the blessed hope, Thy homage at the shrine to pay— Th' all-hallowed shrine—nor doubt nor droop. To shrieve thy Soul perchance from sin, Or fix it in the Heavenward road, Or relique high and blest to win, Hast thou the Pilgrim's pathway trode! Whate'er thy motive be—may'st thou Reap thy reward, and gain thy quest, What are thy toil and labour now, If these may win thee endless rest? Thy frame may wasted be and worn, Thy houseless head sink down oppress'd, Thou may'st of worldly goods be shorn— What matter if thy Soul be bless'd? On Pilgrim!—pause not on thy way— Long is thy journey—far the goal— But better thus to toil and pray, Than let vain sloth destroy the Soul! Behold thy fellow-creatures round! All have a heavy path to tread, On wearying journey all are bound— Life's smoothest ways are steep and dread! All must toil on o'er mount and plain, Through many a dangerous pass must wend; Ah! happy! if they may but gain The Heaven-blessed Palm Branch at the end! The cock hath crowed, the morn hath broke, The citizens are up betimes, And curls cloud-white the wreathed smoke, Which to the sky aspiring climbs. A Ladye fair, and sweet, and young, Herself as beautiful as morn, From sleep with low faint moan hath sprung, Soon as the first day beam is born. Soon as the first faint trembling ray Glanced thro' her window's glimm'ring pane, She rose, as for some festive day— Some happy hour—of joy's bright reign! But turns she not unto her glass, Nor to her tiring-table turns— Her eye doth these regardless pass, As though in sooth she scarce discerns. No more that Ladye shall repair To where the joust is holden high, A stately spectacle and fair— Gay stowre—and warrior-revelry. No more shall she on festal night Join in the brisk and merry dance, With gold and jewels glittering bright— And brighter blush, and smile, and glance. No more in courtly train appear, The first and fairest of the band; While noble knight and cavalier Sigh to possess that snowy hand. No more shall that bright Ladye deck Her form with garments rich and rare; Nor carcanet shall clasp her neck, Nor coronet shall crown her hair. She turns not to her wardrobe proud, Nor to her tiring-table turns; But sinks she down, all lowly bowed, Where a small lamp dim struggling burns. Dim struggling in the increasing light Of kindling morning's saffron glow, That ev'ry moment grew more bright, And deepened in its ruddy flow! That lamp before an image burned Of sweet Madonna, through the night, And there that gentle Ladye turned, And there she knelt in robes of white. And though that lamp now burned so faint, It still a trembling radiance shed O'er her to whom she poured her plaint, To whom her tearful prayers were said. The blessed Virgin Mother, mild, The blessed Queen—who then was seen Clasping the High and Holy Child, All Heaven soft-opening from her mien. 'Twas there she turn'd, 'twas there she knelt, And deep implored for aid divine— And every grief her bosom felt She carried trustful to the shrine. Fast flowed the Ladye's tears the while, And sighs on sighs she breathed amain; (Yet that soft lip seemed made to smile, Not thus to writhe convulsed with pain.) At length she calmly, slowly rose, An aspect less disturbed she wears— Deep sighs no longer speak her woes, Nor wild and warmly-flowing tears! Then, lo!—a gentle maiden brought A garb of gloom—spread dark anon— A garb of gloom, unfringed, unwrought, For that bright Ladye mild to don. She donned that sable vest, whose flow Was like a cloud of darkness round Those graceful limbs that faulter slow In those thick folds and gloomy bound. And to her gentle maiden then The Ladye gave her garments fair, The robes she might ne'er wear again, Outspread in dazzling splendour there. These, these, that Ladye bright resign'd, And fair they shone before the eye, Mantles with sheeny sattins lined, Glitt'ring in all their bravery. Proud robes—long flowing, rich and rare, With rainbow colours deeply dyed, Meet for a noble dame to wear, Resplendent in their floating pride. And costly garbs—trimmed round with fur, With broideries rare and bordering fair, Martin and beauteous Miniver Thick scattered round the chamber there. And robes of pride, and vests of pall, That she, alas! no more may need; She yields them to her maiden all, With gold and fringe and lace and bead. Light veils of airy texture fine, With flowers of gold and silver wrought, Amongst her hair's rich braids to shine— For her a closer veil is brought! Bright fillets for the forehead made With curious skill to adorn the brow! (A frontlet not so fair must shade Her forehead's pure and polished snow!) And girdles broad of many a dye, With needlework all brightly graced, She needs not these—that please the eye, An humbler girdle clasps her waist! Her costly jewels, rich and proud, These she reserves for different doom, Unto the hallowed shrine they're vowed, Where she too bears her youth and bloom. That gloomy garb her choice proclaims, From this cold hollow world she flies, No earthly wish, nor scheme she frames, But lifts beyond the tomb her eyes. She flies to calm religion's shade, Her earthly course e'en now seems done, And there in lowly guise arrayed, Behold the world renouncing nun!— Still stately in her loveliness, Behold her where she silent stands, Enveloped in that solemn dress, With meek-raised eyes and close clasp'd hands. Shows not her skin more dazzling white, For that dull robe of sombre hue?— Up to the throat drawn close and tight That envious garb denies the view. Save her white hands and lovely face, Of that fair skin you naught behold, And frontlet pale that brow's bright grace Doth half in shroudings stern enfold. And now—thus solemnly arrayed, She leaves the Palace' regal halls, And followed by her weeping maid, Takes refuge in a nunnery's walls. Thence sends she back that damsel pale, Who wrings her hands in bitter woe, And utters many a dismal wail, From her dear Ladye forced to go. She sends her back with message meet, And packet seal'd for England's Queen; Could she have knelt but at her feet, And pitied but and pardoned been! Could she with grateful tears have kissed Bright Berengaria's royal hand, And been with blessing kind dismissed, And heard her soft farewell and bland. Then, then not thus would she have mourned, Nor sighed, as grief might have no end! That World she left behind—she scorned!— But mourned her Mistress and her friend! The gentle sisters round her crowd, And whisper consolation kind; But long with heavy sorrow bowed, She struggles with unquiet mind. But vesper hours brought heavenly balm, To soothe her stung and troubled Soul, And matins found her yet more calm, Till Peace upon her Spirit stole! And peace be still her portion where No outward breath of strife may come: That Place of purity and prayer Should be indeed its temple home! The monks of St. Augustine raise, In their high Sanctuary, to-day, A grateful voice of prayer and praise, And gossips whisper, “Well they may!” Echo their strong and massive walls To many a glad and cheery voice, Great good unto their house befalls This day, and therefore they rejoice! Their Monastery's enriched—endowed With broad fair lands and treasure good! Enriched with vast possessions proud— Rare fringings to the frock and hood! The lord of fertile lands and fair With these their abbey hath endowed, And vast possessions,—treasures rare, To Saint Augustine's shrine hath vowed. Full many a wide and teeming plain, Cultured with labour and with care, That yields the waving golden grain, And valleys warm, and meadows fair. In streams of chrystal leap the fish, In pastures green the beeves graze deep, And nought that sense can want or wish But there is found—rare hap to reap! Coverts there are for dainty game— Large woodlands stocked 'tis said right well; And Saint Augustine's monks may claim The whole—green field, clear flood, and fell. And nobly timbered forests too, With giant oaks, Old England's pride; Not twelve hour's ride would bring you through, So thick are they, so long and wide. Stripling new sprung and doddered trunks, And stately trees full grown are there; Well it befits Augustine's monks To raise the voice of praise and prayer. So rich endowment seldom falls Unto the Church's Sons sedate, And the Abbot of Augustine's walls Is lord of Alberic's broad estate! Reclined, doth on a cushion rest The Queen at royal Richard's feet, Whose mighty hand in love caressed, Her locks rolled down in glistering sheet. In glistering sheet of burnished gold, A royal robe of pride indeed! That lustrous hair thick waving rolled, From band and curbing fillet freed. On broidered cushion rests she there, At her dread consort's feet reclined; The lion in his peaceful lair Should seem the gentlest of the kind. He whose stern fame hath proudly flown O'er all the scared earth, wide and far, To her but breathes love's tenderest tone, That lion-lord of strife and war. I guess one glance from her blue eye Can even his sternest mood controul; And oh! one tear he there might spy, Would melt and move his purposed Soul! But now no tear that blue eye had, As beautiful as bluest Heaven, And yet a faint expression sad Seemed to its orb refulgent given. A gentle shade—a touch of care Dwelt her rich rosy lips around, And brooded o'er her forehead fair, Whence back the bright hair stream'd unbound. And ever and anon a sigh Escaped the beauteous lady's breast, And spake too well and feelingly A heart in sooth not all at rest. “Now cease, mine own fair Queen, to grieve, This wayward Maid's for ever gone, And sith she chose thy side to leave, E'en let her memory now alone! Most sure am I she is not worth One sigh from these sweet lips of thine, That shame all roses of the earth— Nay, all that may in Eden shine! Let pass—my light of life, let pass, And never utter more her name; In sooth, she was a dainty lass, At chorded lute and broidery frame!— A dainty wench she was, I ween, At pastime light and merry sport, The fairest and the brightest seen, In this—our royal English court. But thou, whom lofty duties claim, And mighty interests should engage Sweet Berengaria—it were shame That thou should'st mourn for maid or page. And though she loved thee passing well, (Though now her love shows doubtful sign,) One true heart still doth near thee dwell, And, Berengaria sweet—'tis mine!” “Nay, good my lord,” the Queen replied, “'Tis but at times I mourn her loss, Let not my princely Richard chide, Nor seek my pensive mood to cross! To convent walls too swiftly fled That sunbright flower of beauty bright, Ere well her wild resolve was weighed, And pondered—wisely and aright. And I must sigh to think how strange The lot of hapless Britomart; From court to cell, how dire a change— But worse to bear a breaking heart. She suffered deeply much I know, And wildly loved the ill-fated maid, And but by bitterness and woe Was her profound affection paid. At times her pallid features rise Upon my very dreams at night, With shaded brows and sunken eyes, She that was once so glad and bright. Alas! but love indeed must be A wonderous and a deadly thing, To crush the joyous and the free With such surpassing suffering! To tame down youth's quick heart and warm, And make life's self a weary weight, Oh! it must be a deadly charm! A poisoned spring of fearful fate! I marvel if this broken rose— This wounded bird—in her calm bower, Declines beneath her grievous woes, Or mends with every creeping hour! I knew not which to think were best— Alas! if this vain Love's regret Should cease to wound her gentle breast, How 'gainst her bars she then should fret! How fret 'gainst her close prison bars, And weep for all she left behind; Torn by conflicting feeling's jars, And struggling with an altered mind! For shame she scarce may thence retire! The Abbess will urge her holy suit, Threat, promise, prove—accuse, inspire, And with persuasion—persecute! I would that something might he done To set that maiden free again; Could I but see her once alone, Perchance I might persuade her then! At least I fain would surely know If 'tis her own unbiassed will To take the vestal votaress' vow, And dwell in peaceful convent still.” “Tut, tut, she chose her goodly perch From wounded love or wounded pride, Leave her in lap of Mother Church, Where wayward maids had best abide! She chose herself her own fair nest, And there, then, let her be in peace, For ill-used damsels and distressed 'Tis harbour good—where heart-aches cease. Why here's a coil, forsooth—good lack! Because one foolish lass and fond Is crossed in love, and turns her back On this base world, to look beyond. A goodly coil, forsooth, is here, Because one witless wench is left Without her faithless lover dear, And deems herself of all bereft. Why! Ladye mine, demure and meek, I wot that I could tell a tale Should make that vermeil velvet cheek So fair, by turns grow red and pale! A tale of suffering, stern and keen, At which that cheek might well turn pale, Since its rare smoothness and its sheen Taught bearded men to waste and wail. Rememberest thou that valiant Knight Of loftiest line and haughtiest mien, That sunk with dazzled soul and sight Before the glance of England's Queen? 'Midst all in Palestine that fought, He was unmatched in strength and skill; But Love sets skill and strength at nought, And joys to tame the Valiant still. Rememberest thou his mournful death, Consumed by inward-gnawing care, And how he owned with dying breath His fatal love and long despair? But well I ween not he alone Quailed helplessly beneath thine eye, Full many a manly breast made moan For England's matchless Royalty! Princes and Chiefs of royal line— ('Twas whispered, as I mind me well)— Seeking the host in Palestine, Victims to thy rare beauty fell! Archducal Austria, rumour said, Blenched under that victorious smile, And secret homage silent paid To her who did all hearts beguile! And Royal France himself, I wot, Looked loving-wise on that sweet face, And half his wisdom's craft forgot, Bewitched by that unrivalled grace! In sooth, all hearts that there throbb'd high, Bent Soldanrie's throned strength to shake, Learned then to throb, and heave, and sigh, For fairest England's peerless sake.” Thus jested gay the Lion King, With many a cunning look the while— With fond and kindly hope to bring Back to his Queen's fair cheek its smile. Nor failed he—every shadowy trace Of sorrow fled from lip and eye, And left that beauteous Angel face Cloudless as bright Midsummer's sky. “Nay, rake not up these stories old, Methinks they are but flatterer's tales— Though something thus I have been told— But much my treacherous memory fails. Of that fair maid yet one more word, And then a truce to such vain theme— But pray thee tell me, good my lord, Canst thou of her gay rival deem? I urged her ever to confess, For well I marked herself she knew; But still it liked her to suppress Who 'twas that all her hopes o'erthrew! It surely is some desperate love That her ingrateful chosen Knight Is for his sins condemned to prove— I own I joy with well-pleased spite! He must have marked she loved him well, That hapless maid—he must have seen— For look and action both would tell The unspoken wishes of his Queen. And therefore do I joy to find He suffers hopeless passion too, For land and love he leaves behind, And doth a weary path pursue— Sith he is gone, so saith report, A Pilgrim to the Holy Land— Strange whim to quit the joyous court, Wealth—mirth—and pomp, and broad command. Say, can my Royal Richard guess Where he hath left his stricken heart, That, armed 'gainst love and loveliness, Bowed not to beauteous Britomart?” The Lion-Monarch for a space, With glance to search a Stoic's soul, Looked down on that ingenuous face, Then to his lips the keen smile stole. Fixed on her countenance awhile Remained his scrutinizing gaze, Till slow relaxing to a smile, O'er his an arch expression strays. “Thou'lt tell me I'm a sorcerer-wight If I to thee unfold the tale— And yet methinks by this good light I could the wond'rous truth unveil! Methinks that I aright could spell This strange dark mystery, line and leaf The riddle guess—the secret tell— And speak in open phrase and brief.” “Indeed,”—the startled dame replied, “Then lose no time, but tell at once. But wherefore didst thou know and hide?— Quick, quick, I wait thy prompt response.” “What is't that thou, fair dame, would'st know, Who won from hapless Britomart, With charms of more than mortal glow, That noble Knight's devoted heart? Is't this my blue eyed Queen would know? Nay, fret not with impatient pout— Suppose to thee the dame I show— How know'st thou but she waits without. I bade her here to speak with thee On this distressful matter now, And thou thyself shalt judge and see How bright her cheek, how white her brow.” The King with sudden bound upsprang, And strode past to the arch-wayed door, Near which did deftly ordered hang The armour which at jousts he wore. Thence snatched he straight his splendid shield, Which gleamed e'en like the round bright moon— Broad mirror made its polished field, Whose steel like sparkling chrystal shone. Broad mirror fair—where ye might trace Revealed upon its surface bright Each clear marked feature of the face, Set in a bickering sea of light. Before the Queen he placed it there, Placed it the bright haired Queen before, Then cried—“Behold the matchless Fair! Whom none can see—and not adore.” Her blue and bright and beaming eyes The beauteous Berengaria raised— Wrapt in the silence of surprise, On that reflected form she gazed. And be ye sure no form so fair Ere mirror offered to the view As that which glittered peerless there, Retraced with perfect semblance true. Around the cushion where she sate Her hair streamed, loosed from ev'ry fold, As drawn down by its own rich weight, It rolled its waves of rippled gold. Her eyes, through lashes curled and long, Flashed their blue beams of radiance keen; Not oft they flashed thus clear and strong, Her's mostly was a downcast mien— But now surprise and wonderment, With pain and doubt, and shame and pride, Together in her aspect blent, Expression's finest soul supplied! One blush of flame-bright scarlet rushed O'er throat—brow—dimpled chin and cheek— With such a sudden splendour flushed Doth morn in tropic climates break. That blush of fire pierced kindling through The golden shadowings of her hair— That blush, the rising sun's own hue— That hair, the cloud's tint—he makes fair. Slow faded soon that blush of fire From smooth white throat—clear cheek and brow— A look half sorrow and half ire Dwells on those lovely features now. Yet varies still the expression fast Upon those features' living scroll; Now gentler shades of pity past, Now self-reproach there trembling stole. A troubled frown—a lurking smile— A furtive glance—a rising tear— Betrayed the varying thought the while, And still the King stood laughing near. And still shunned his, her conscious eye, While round her mouth soft quivering play Half-smiles, that she in vain would try To conquer and to chase away. “Well!—Speaks the cunning Sorcerer sooth, My blue eyed Berengare, I pray? I wot this secret web in truth Is well unravelled—by my fay. Another time, sweet witch, take heed, And when some brave heart true and warm, Thou'dst wish should prove some fair one's meed, Leave it to her to work the charm! Let her own eyes their battle do, Nor seek to help them, thus with thine, Sith, these are far too bright and blue As meek auxiliaries to shine. Ev'n thus when foreign armies aid Some country to subdue her foe, That country's oft a victim made, The spoils to the alien armies go! My bird of beauty—sweet Gazelle, (I pray thee, mark, I still can learn My true and loving thought to tell In the Oriental fabling turn.) My sweet Gazelle, henceforth, take heed, Leave love and lovers if thou'rt wise, Ev'n to themselves—if slow they speed Ne'er light them with those dangerous eyes. Thy hapless maiden rued full sore, And he that now is forced to fly, That pilgrim bound to sacred shore, Queen Berengaria's courtesy.” The tears now trickle from her eyes, Her long curled lashes glisten wet, And low she murmurs—faultering sighs— “Was woman e'er so witless yet?” “Nay, cheer thee, sweet, and arm thy mind, Away with tears—hence, hence with sighs, The fault is—that thou'rt over kind, And—with thy leave—not over wise! A lesson thou hast learned through this— That thou shouldst keep in memory long, 'Twere pity such rebuke to miss, Experience mends whate'er is wrong! Thou'lt play henceforth a wiser part, Far sager and more cautious grown, And lay thy lures but for one heart, And that one thou shalt claim—thine own.” “And 'tis all thine—for ever thine, Thou know'st it—Ha!”—and well I ween, Right loving word and gentle sign, Received the Monarch from his Queen! Meet gentle sign and loving word!— Offered in love—by love believed— Ev'n then the lion-hearted lord From his all beauteous Queen received! Months after months have rolled away, Time ne'er delayeth on his course— But hour by hour, and day by day, Makes helpless mortals feel his force. Who comes into the city's streets With withered palm-branch in his hand, Whom every passer reverent greets, A Palmer from the Holy Land. His sandal shoon are soiled and torn, His threadbare mantle tattered waves, His frame is gaunt and spare and worn, His eye is keen as sharp-edged glaives. His beard is matted thick and long, Coal-black without one hair of grey, Coal-black his locks that curling strong Around his haggard features play. Full stately is his step and gait, Though wearied seems the way-worn man, The loiterers by the path that wait, Turn still his lofty frame to scan. Fast through the street he wins his way To fair St. Catherine's Convent bound; He gains it at the close of day, That Pilgrim from the Holy Ground. A relique hath he to bestow On the good Abbess—worthy dame— From Hermit who of yore did know, On English soil her sainted fame. A Hermit of the Holy Land, Who long had left his country's shores To dwell on Syria's burning sand, Where he Heaven's grace for aye implores. The Palmer at the Convent gate Of sweet St. Catherine's—noble pile, Doth wearied, dust-defiled, await, And there awaits a weary while. Hark! 'tis the funeral bell's slow toll, That dull deep tone accosts his ears— It sounds for some freed sister's Soul, Now saved from earthly woes and fears. He knocks and knocks again, at last The Portress at the gate appears, Her aspect is by grief o'ercast, She speaks with choaking sobs and tears. “Good Palmer! pardon this delay, The convent mourns with one full heart, Her whom the grave receives this day— The sainted sister Britomart.” “I grieve to tresspass on your woe, But fain would speak five minutes space With the good Abbess ere I go, And in her hands this packet place.” “Then, reverend Palmer, come, I pray,” The weeping Portress answering said, And, turning from the door, the way With slow and faultering steps she led. To give her burthened heart relief Still dwells she on the mournful theme, For ofttimes garrulous is grief— The while her eyes with fond tears stream. “Oh! Sister Britomart was one Of loveliest form and loftiest birth; She left our Queen to be a Nun— And now for Heaven she leaves the Earth. From a court beauty, famed and praised, She came a votaress meek to be; From Vestal Nun to Angel raised, She joins a brighter company. Earl Hubert's youngest, favourite child She was, the flower of all her race, So fair, so stately, yet so mild— Her sweet Soul lightened through her face. Alas! she lieth in her shroud— So young—yet, Oh! so ripe to die; O'er us is come Death's sombre cloud, For she lives in the illumined sky!” “Earl Hubert's child?” with thoughtful air And sorrowing tone, the Palmer said, “The Ladye Britomart—so fair— Is she, indeed, good sister—dead?” “Aye, reverend Palmer, sooth, she is— Our Ladye guard her Soul and keep; And may she live in endless bliss, And joy's eternal harvest reap. “Amen!” the sable Palmer cried, Through winding passage long and dim, Following his sad and sorrowing guide, Who ceased not whispering still to him, “Poor Sister Britomart! two years And more are fled since first she came— For ever was she then in tears— Our Abbess used to chide and blame! 'Twas on the first of March—the morn Was smiling as a morn in May, That here she weeping came forlorn— Love-crossed—for so did gossips say. They said she loved a noble Knight, Of bearing proud and martial mien, But rumour said—(oft rumour's right,) He looked but on our lovely Queen. Our sweet Queen Berengaria's face 'Twas said he looked on evermore, Bewitched by her bright charms and grace, That taught ev'n Paynims to adore! This grief weighed sore on Britomart, Her woe in sooth she might not speak!— But still she sighed and wept apart, And pale and paler grew her cheek. This grief was more than she could bear, This broke her heart and sent her here— Nay! I doubt not the venomed care Hath stretched her on her early bier. Our fair Queen mourned with sorrow true, Her favourite maiden's loss awhile— 'Twas whispered that Her Grace ne'er knew The grief that crushed her bloom and smile. And for the Knight, that self same day, To Holy Mother Church he gave His goods and great estates away, For which may Heaven's dear Saints him save! And on that self same day he took The pilgrim's staff and scrip—and went, With shell and cross, and bead and book, To Palestine's sweet countrie bent. Since when—but reverend Palmer, why! What dost thou loitering thus behind?— Our Lady Abbess' room is nigh, Whom we shall lone and praying find. Move softly on—she watching weeps, She bends beneath this weary loss, And many a lonely vigil keeps, With beads, and breviary, and cross. They moved then on a few steps more, Both silent now they moved on slow, Then oped his guide the massive door, And spoke his errand whispering low. Vaulted and lofty was the room, Whence Eve's last rays excluded were, Pale tapers flickered in the gloom, And frowning shadows lengthened there. Full in the midst—deep veil'd and still The Abbess of St. Catherine sate, Some mournful duty to fulfil, She seem'd attired in solemn state. She signed the cross, she bent her head, Faint welcome bade in whisper hoarse— She sate beside the shrouded dead, The patient watcher of the corse. Extended cold and moveless there, A form remained composed in death, Around a shroud was drawn with care, White as the mountain's snowy wreath. Beneath that floating veil which spread, Of clear transparent texture fine— Bright locks a sunny lustre shed, And gleamed with rich and golden shine!— And those calm marble features showed All beautiful in Death's repose— Such the pale moon when her abode Is 'midst faint clouds, like sculptured snows. The clay-cold hands were gently crossed Upon that hushed unthrobbing heart; Oh! early to Life's sorrows lost, Thou slumberest well, sweet Britomart! But in thy brief and rapid life, 'Twas thine deep Suffering's cup to drain— And they who bear such bosomed strife, Ne'er long to bear its brunt remain. The Palmer then, sans word or sign, Knelt down beside the silent Dead— He knelt as by some hallowed shrine, And lowly bowed he his bare head! With head uncovered, low he bowed, And prayed for that departed Soul, While ever sounded, deep and loud, The solemn bell's funereal toll. With head uncovered, low he bent, And seemed absorbed in silent prayer, The Abbess, with long watching spent, Sate silent as the slumberer there. And all the while with iron tongue, That ghostly bell did loudly toll— With stern vibrations still it rung, And smote upon the answering Soul. Long, long in secret prayer he knelt, That silent man—then slow arose, Loosed a light packet from his belt, Which sacred relique doth enclose. That sacred relique was a shred Of blessed Mary's precious hair— A shred from that divinest head, In Beatific Beauty fair. “Mother of Sorrows!” murmured low The Abbess, as she reverent took The all-hallowed gift—“Thou drank'st of woe— On griefs unmatched—'twas thine to look! Mother of Sorrows!—hear—oh, hear! Heal our faint hearts with anguish riven, Wipe from our weary eyes the tear, And snatch our Sister's Soul to Heaven!” “Amen!” in faultering accents said That Palmer pale—Saint Catherine's guest— Then bless'd the corse—and gently laid His withered palm-branch on its breast! A THOUGHT. This World we little know—'tis like one note In mighty harmonies that boundless float, One thought detached of some deep conscious Soul 'Tis but a part—we judge it as a whole! SONNET. [Beside Astroni's lake we rested while] Beside Astroni's lake we rested while The woods remurmured to the turtle-dove, And its rich note of deep and perfect love— Green gleam'd they there in evening's gentle smile. But oh!—that dove's dear murmur, that did pile, Memory on memory in my heart, which strove In dreams to greet full many a tufted grove And wood of England stretched for lengthening mile— Nor vainly strove!—Our Thoughts great Wizards are, And make this outward world their spell obey. I saw then where the vistas vanished far, But glimpse of English hamlet—and where lay The shadows darkling—the free light to bar, What English flowers waved bright—what fern-leaves-plumes did play! THE TEMPLE OF JUPITER SERAPIS AT POZZUOLI. It is a sunny and a lovely spot Where Jupiter Serapis' columns stand— Disfeatured fragments—and on either hand Idly aspire—these towards the skies were shot, The glorious temple roof to uphold—but not The temple roof now crowns them; but the bland Blue beauteous skies, arched over sea and land, Round this proud ruin—shedding without blot, Or haze-drawn flaw—their glad untimely smiles! Since such they seemed one little while to us! In mockery flaunting these—Time's trophied piles!— But basking in their glitterings, tremulous Soon deemed we, won by golden sunshine's wiles— Our thoughts untimely then, that blamed sweet nature thus. THE ISLAND OF CAPRI. Island of Beauty! rising like a throne From out these lovely waters calm and blue, The sunset now burns o'er thee, and doth strew Thy heights with rich and ruddy beams—each one!— Jove, from his great Olympus—starry-strown, Might gaze down envious on thee—(for thy hue Is most celestial) covetous of the due Of his proud rival Neptune—reigning lone. For, Isle of Beauty! thou thyself dost seem A little rosy Heaven of Love and Light, And round thee, robed in tints triumphal, beam Such seas of sapphire glory—kindling bright— Such shores of pride, with prodigal charms, that teem— A galaxy of Heavens seems opening on the sight! SONNET TO THE SAME. [I look on thee for long, and never tire—] I look on thee for long, and never tire— Sea-crowning Island! thou'rt so proudly fair, Amidst the azure tides outshining there, A landmark where so much is to admire! Where rests the eye content—all things respire Love, peace, delight around—and banish care! How gleams't thou now thro' this white dazzling air, Bright as some little World of Light—of fire! Thou'rt seen like one Star in a Heaven of calm, For thy sweet Sister-Islands are afar— And the eye dwells on thee—gives thee the palm!— We ask what the elements that frame thee are, (Still drinking Fancy's cup of nectarous balm) For sure of earth thou'rt not—but rarer mould, Sea-Star! ENGLAND. England! and there, Oh! there thou art In all thy mighty pride and power, Ah! never dearer to my Heart Than now—in this returning hour! I half forget thy greatness now— Thy boast of proud and broad command, For thou'rt my happy Home, and thou My darling, darling Native Land! Empire of Empires!—Queen of Earth! Victorious Queen of Earth and Sea! Thine is a charm of holiest worth— The charm of Home felicity! Thou art a glorious Queen, and thou A nursing Mother, bland and kind!— Nations may to thy Sceptre bow— Thy Sons thy smile more potent find! A glorious Queen art thou—and thou A guardian angel England art!— As to a Mother's bosom now, I haste to lean upon thy Heart! All honour to thy towering Fame! But shame, deep shame, on him that roams, Forgetting this thy holiest claim— England!—that thou'rt the Land of Homes! ON PASSING A CORPSE LYING IN STATE AT NAPLES. There thou art laid deprived of bloom and breath, With all the heavy circumstance of death Around thee, 'tis a most funereal gloom, Which these sad tapers mournfully illume. A sable canopy doth o'er thee frown, Deep sable curtains round thee darkle down, And make a midnight gloom in this bright place, And half the day's glad beauty seem to chase. Statues of silver bend thy form beside, Thus picturing weeping mourners heavy-eyed— While thou unconscious liest composed in death, Deprived of sense and strength, of bloom and breath. Of bloom! perchance in sooth thou wert in age, Right glad at length thy mortal thirst to assuage, At the immortal fountains! glad indeed To put aside this coil of fleshly weed, And spring in freedom to thy skyey home, And we surround thee with vain show of gloom! Our state it suiteth better far than thine, Thou never more may'st grieve, nor sigh, nor pine— For Joy and Peace, that like two Angels still Are seen (from Expectation's soaring hill) Hovering on our horizon—never here To be approached by faultering foot more near. Perchance thou wert in age—the o'ershadowing veil, Spread o'er thine altered features chill and pale, Hinders the eye from judging of thee well, We know but Death beneath that veil doth dwell!— Sleep soundly—sweetly sleep! poor pallid clay, Sleep hour by hour, sleep night and morn and day, Thy workday care is done, thy toil is o'er, Sleep the sweet sleep to be disturb'd no more; Cross thy calm hands on thy calm pulseless breast, And take thy fill of deep unbroken rest. No part laborious canst thou have to play, Unblamed sluggard! sleep thine hours away. The great of earth, the noble, and the wise, To do proud deeds, and think stern thoughts must rise. But thou—shalt still more reckless, thoughtless be Than the swathed child laid on the nurse's knee; Thou shalt not hunger, and thou shalt not thirst, On thee the elements may do their worst— War and its ravage can do thee no harm, Thou art girdled round with an enduring charm; Armies might waste their valourous rage on thee, But gain defeat—be mock'd with victory! Sleep soundly! Sweetly sleep! thou need'st not fear, Nothing can wrong thee in this earthly sphere; Kings may have guards to watch around their throne, Vassalls and slaves—for thee thou needest none! No King was e'er so safe as thou art now, Fierce strifes might waste whole tribes and realms—but thou! The world's crash should not rouse thee—not so! then That trump shall sound which wakes the dead again! THE DISCONSOLATE YOUNG LADY. Oh! sweet Anne, 'tis alas! my first woe, One, I fear, I shall never recover, While I'm yet doomed to wander below, I have lost—I have lost my false lover. He swore to be true—still he swore, I believed him, and then did we sever; Can I ever know happiness more? Thought of anguish!—Oh! never, no never! You see that my cheek is grown pale, Oh! my dear happy friend, can you wonder— I must tell you my dark mournful tale, When, when will life's thread snap in sunder? What words, Ah! what words can e'er paint My wild love, and my still wilder sorrow? Wilt thou list to my bitter complaint? But what words, Oh! what words can I borrow? In such accents of music he spake, Such fires in his dark eyes were beaming, Sure I scarcely can be quite awake, E'en now I could think I was dreaming! Hope, false hope, thou art deceitful and vain, A shadow, a reed, and a bubble— Memory, fly from my agonized brain, Every pang doth your presence redouble. Oh! Anne, may'st thou never be taught The sufferings thy poor friend's enduring, To which all other sufferings are naught, These—these there's no calming nor curing. Why was he so matchless? I ask— Or why, why had I eyes to behold him? To forget is a stern fearful task, My heart's shrine will for ever enfold him. I loved him, too wildly and well, And to love me, the Inconstant pretended— My soul's misery no language can tell, Every hope, every feeling is ended. Oh! surely man's made up of guile! To think he, I so loved and so trusted, Should have proved so perfidious and vile— With the World and its joys I'm disgusted. Three weeks I had known him, and more, All this time he seemed true and devoted; But the sweet halcyon vision is o'er, Oh! how fondly on him have I doated. All constant and changeless he was, For those three happy weeks, bright and sunny; But he now loves Miss Belmont—alas! Or rather, he doats on her money! But the sunflower must turn from the Sun, From the Pole-star the needle must sever, Ere I from mine Idol am won, Tho' he spurns and deserts me for ever. I must love, and love on to the end, Since for me there's no change nor forgetting; Don't you think, pray my dear pitying friend, I am grown very thin with this fretting? I rejoice these poor lungs are not strong, I care not—it can matter but little, My life's bowl will be broken ere long, 'Tis well life's poisoned bowl is so brittle! I feel every string of my heart, Like mine untuned harp's strings, now are breaking, Well I know that I soon must depart, 'Tis a solemn farewell we're now taking. But despair can scarce fear coming Death, Oh! regret not thy friend's dissolution, The sharp sword must still wear thro' the sheath, Grief, like mine, saps the best constitution! O'er thy friend's early grave thou wilt bend, And remember her calm resignation; But I charge thee weep not for thy friend— Let him weep who thus wrought desolation. How, thou hard hearted Sun! canst thou shine O'er a Being in hopelessness sighing? One small comfort, Oh! Anne! is still mine,— Yes, I feel it—I know I am dying! Why!—who is it is coming this way? Sure 'tis young Major Monck of the Lancers, Come to give us a call, I dare say— Do you know he's the finest of dancers! Oh! and Colonel de Vere of the Guards, Who they say is so handsome and clever, Will they call, or but leave us their cards? I could look at that Man's face for ever. I'm so glad that my room is in front, 'Tis so charming to see who is coming; None like him can shoot, drive, fish, and hunt— That's the last Opera air that he's humming. He has got the best bouquet du Roi— 'Tis not only his figure and beauty, But there's such a sweet je ne sais quoi; I first saw him last Monday on duty. Look out, Anne!—are they come to the door? Pray, now mind that they don't see you peeping— Oh! my eyes are quite red—what a bore! With this stupid, nonsensical weeping. What could I have cried for, my dear? What was it about I was weeping? Oh! I recollect now!—are they near? Why, how slow they are crawling and creeping! They have stopped here then?—well! I declare! How provoking, yet, Oh! how delightful! All these papillottes stuck in my hair!— Help me, Anne!—and say, do I look frightful? Let's be quick, dearest Love! only think, To-day, in my foolish dejection, I put on this vile gown of pale pink, And pink never becomes my complexion. Shall I have time to change it? no, no— If we loiter, perhaps they'll be going— Oh! but give me that pretty black bow, In my hair, stuck just so, 'twill look knowing! I must look rather mournful and low, I do wish I'd a little less colour, 'Tis too much of a flush and a glow, What would I not give it were duller! All the World, I don't doubt, know my case, How ill used I have been and forsaken— Don't you think on each side of my face My long locks should more loosely be shaken. I wish I was not dressed in pink, Oh! my folly I'm sorely repenting, With vexation I feel I could sink! But come, now! 'tis of no use lamenting. Come now, Anne! how you dawdle, make haste, George de Vere you'll adore, I assure you— Take that hideous green belt from your waist, Or, I'm sure, he'll detest and abjure you! He is Heir to twelve thousand a-year, And he plays the guitar they say finely— He is sure to be made soon a peer, And can dance the Mazurka divinely! He has such a nice house—near the Park, And will have a fine mansion in Devon, And you ne'er yet saw whiskers so dark, And he is but just turned twenty-seven. Are you ready?—then let us go down— How do I look now;—speak sincerely; He's the handsomest creature in town— Oh! I feel I could love him so dearly. When I saw him on Monday, at once Stood my destiny's star still before him! If my love in his soul wakes response, Oh! Anne! how my heart will adore him! THE BALL. Dear Mamma, you must give your first party To-morrow—it must be a Ball! You know you may set down to écarté, We shan't want your presence at all. Yes, I know that our rooms are too little, And our means are extremely confined; Can that matter a jot or a tittle, When once we have made up our mind. 'Tis of no use to say more about it, So pray let us settle our plan; I and Fanny can not do without it, Now let's think o'er each smart dancing man. Let us write our select invitations— We will ask all the dandies in town; And be sure to cut all poor relations, Mr. Green, Mrs. Black, and Miss Brown. Lady Summers has promised to lend us Her lovely Jardiniere so nice; I was sure she would kindly befriend us— No doubt 'twill be here in a trice. We will have such a load of exotics, Dear Mamma—I dare say they'll be cheap; I know you always find them narcotics, But then, if you like, you can sleep. 'Tis a pity the stairs are so narrow— Mrs. Broadside stuck in them last week— One need be as thin as an arrow To mount them—and then too, they creak. Well! this cannot be changed, it is certain, But away the new carpet we'll take— And remove this fine fresh staring curtain; Why, Mamma! how you shiver and shake. Oh! the house will be truly enchanting, When dismantled and cleared in this way— Only one thing indeed will be wanting, That is lamps its new charms to display. A huge chandelier very splendid We must purchase whate'er be the price; Money cannot be better expended— Oh! 'twill be so delightful and nice! These floors will need scrubbing and cleaning, So we better had all stay up stairs! 'Gainst the wall must the Chaperones rest leaning, For indeed there is no room for chairs. If the heat should be quite overpowering, We must open the windows and doors; What a great deal of sweeping and scouring Will be needed to brighten these floors. Oh! this atmosphere's horribly choaking, 'Tis a pity my dear brother Hugh Should be so much addicted to smoaking, For he poisons the house through and through. We must burn here pastilles by the dozen, To try and get rid of the smell; No!—Mamma! I will not ask my cousin, You know that she ne'er dresses well. And, besides too, her hair's red as carrots; No! I cannot invite her indeed; Nor my two maiden aunts so like parrots, With those voices—and beaks! 'tis decreed. As for legacies—if they bereave us, Most unjust I such conduct shall call; If they please they may penniless leave us, But I vow I will not spoil the ball! Mrs. Bradford, with seven plain young ladies, I must really too, beg to decline: Though to dance and to flirt, true, their trade is, Not here shall they flutter and shine! For that old fashioned clock of your mother's, Dear Mamma—we must have that displaced— Mrs. Marr—Mrs. Caulfield, and others, Say 'tis now in the very worst taste. Now pray do not fly into a passion— We must sell it, or give, or exchange; I abhor things so much out of fashion— At the ball 't would look shocking and strange. I am sorry I can't ask Miss Drury, (Though my friend—she's a sad hodmadod;) But already, 'tis fact I assure ye, We have asked a few hundred and odd. If all come—'twill be quite suffocation— But myself this will not much displease; Since at least it will cause some sensation, As the Season's superlative Squeeze. EARTH'S VANITIES. Proud palliament and silken stole, Such as seems to flow and roll Like a shining billow down, Crimson'd sunlight from it thrown, Kingly pall and panoply, Dazzling to the startled eye, These shall yield—all vainly proud— Even to the shroud—the shroud. Trumpet blast, and harp's rich tone, Organ-anthem's glorious groan; Roll of doubling drums—and more Thunder of artilery's roar— Human voices' pealing strain, Loud as chiming of the main; These must sink—while deep shall swell— Awfully—the knell—the knell! Palaced piles of pompous state, High built dwellings of the great; Sculptured domes and scutcheoned halls, Trophied gates and bannered walls, Structures wrought with curious art, Perfect made through every part; These resigned—their Lords shall crave Place but in the grave—the grave! THE ZEGRI MAIDEN. “Sad Zegri Maiden! in sweet years of flowering, What may weigh thus on thy stately step? To cloud thy brow beneath thine hair's rich showering, To chill the smile half trembling to thy lip.” “Ask me not—ask me not; I would endeavour To endure my sorrows, but to enshroud them too, Even from myself, though ever and for ever A low voice startles me with bodings true. Woe to the maiden who can love a stranger, And treble woe to her that loves a foe! What! in my Land's deliverance, is there danger, That all my hopes should be undone below?” “Oh! Zegri Maiden, I can blame thee never— Love, love, is of no country, and no clime; And ever gains he strength from foiled endeavour, To chase him from the heart in his young prime. Sad Zegri Maiden—hapless Zegri Maiden, Thou must love on, till suffering ends in death— For, with such deep conflicting sorrows laden, Soon, soon the mourner yields her mortal breath!” SONNET TO NAPLES. Naples! I go!—with no reluctant heart, With no fond-lingering looks, no sighs averse, For hope doth now her brilliant themes rehearse, Since 'tis for native England I depart— Still feel the Soul keen separation's smart, That well may teach the faithful-picturing verse, A momentary mournfulness to nurse; But fresh thoughts spring!—and with a sudden start I turn from this dull tenour of my song; It dwells on feelings fraught with deep delight, For they gush free, and full, and bright, and strong, And thick as stars throng on a Summer's night— Naples! I go!—yet charms to thee belong, That make this fond farewell thy due and right! TO THE NIGTINGALE. How, Nightingale! how thy rich bursts of voice Make this heart pant, and tremble, and rejoice; Its bounding pulses thou canst captive take, But more than this, sweet wizard, thou can'st make The many wing?d air thy prisoner, That scarcely round thee seems to breathe or stir; But in a charmed and changeless hush to lie, Brooding about thee, listening lovingly— Thou smoothest down the harsh World with thy strain; And when the stars come forth—a glorious train— Thou wedd'st thy music to their hallow'd light, As thou wouldst make that World (in the Angels' sight,) More worthy seem of that high company— Bird, of a thousand songs!—deep gushing free, 'Tis well that one rich strain of concord deep, Should rise from out its hardened heart to keep, Just tune and time with that unceasing song, Which pours forth praise where doth all praise belong— That mighty Song—that everlasting strain, Which we, unworthy still, to join—remain. THE TOMB'S REPROOF. Speak! then dark tomb! speak to us sternly now, Life's heart-sick wayfarers, who ever bow Beneath one dread but self-adjusted yoke, How many chains hast thou not loosed and broke? How many troubles calmed, and tortures cured? For in thy clasp our peace is well assured, And never can be wronged or shaken more Though so uncertain and unfixed before— Thou can'st bid sink—at once how still and low, Within our heart that feverish feverish glow, That urges ever onwards—what, Ah! what Beside thee, seem the changes of our lot? Vain seem our pleasures—vain our fancied pain, Our feastings and our merry-makings vain; And our fond mournings at thy voice' dull sound, Existence owns its limit and its bound! Laughter and tears are done with—all is still, And we no fate have farther to fulfil! Vain are our lingerings on some favourite track, Our settings out, and our returnins back; And vain our busy hurryings to and fro, Our trackings and retrackings—swift or slow; Our givings and our takings—hopes and fears, All the frothed trouble of our yeasty years, Vain our joy-givings at the natal hour, Or when the fair bride comes with love's rich dower. Vain our rejoicings at the nuptial board, And vain our groans when Earth to Earth's restored— Vain are our gatherings together all, Far are we scattered when that stroke doth fall— The stroke of Death which gives us unto thee, And bids us clay, and dust, and ashes be. Oh! Tomb! thy still small voice can chase away All our delusions, as night chases day; They vanish, and for ever ever then, And we ourselves appear no more again! BIRD!—BIRD! Bird!—Bird! would I might be Borne skywards—sunwards—ev'n now with thee. Bird of the daybreak—Lark! happy singer, That scornest 'midst Earth's bowers of shadow to linger— When the great Sun is forth in his joy and his might, And the sky shines in beauty and splendour of light— One Paradise-Wilderness—glorious and strange, And paved with the pomp of perpetual change! Bird!—Bird!—would I might be Borne skywards—sunwards—e'en now with thee. Bird!—Bird!—would I might be Borne skywards—sunwards—e'en now with thee— Bird of the Heaven-land—that singest in rapture! The heart of the listener to conquer and capture— Thou soarest above this dull world's cloudy sphere, Without comrade or counsellor—partner or peer— How look'st it to thee from thy proudly gained height, Like a world all of freshness, and gladness, and light? Bird! Bird!—would I might be Borne skywards—sunwards—e'en now with thee. THE SPANISH MAIDEN'S SORROW. Waters of Rio Verde—flow ye still, Fair as ye flowed when by my native hill I wandered free from every dream of care— Sweet Rio Verde, yes! thou still art fair! But she who bent above thy mirror wave, With feeble step is hurrying to the grave; She is no longer fair—her altered brow Would but cast gloom o'er that bright mirror now! Oh! never more may she bring back to thee Smooth cheek of bloom—or eye of brightness free; Waters of Rio Verde! mirror back, Far fairer faces on your silvery track! Sweet Rio Verde—Rio Verde flow, Glad beneath morn's young smile, and noontide's glow, May shade ne'er dim thee—may no stains deface! But lovely things—but smiles of love retrace. Oh! be the clearest air—the fairest sky— Still glassed back by thy smooth transparency; Enough of shadows and of sorrows sore, Have wronged thy sweet sweet shores in days of yore. Waters of Rio Verde—flow in light, The stranger streams that sparkle on my sight, Seem void of music and repose to be, They are not streams of Spain—they are not thee! THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS. How do we seek for happiness Where'er our restless footsteps press; Climbing the heights of Heaven, and then Lingering amongst the Earth-haunts of men, By sea—by shore—by mount—and plain— Abroad—at home—and still in vain. In calm and secret solitude, Or where the common herd intrude— Where the proud city's hum is heard, Or but the matins of the bird; And the light footsteps of the fawn, Shaking the scattered dews of dawn. Some in Ambition's haughty ways, Some where the Syren Pleasure strays, And some, and, Oh! the wisest those, In bowers of studious calm repose. But few in their own deepest heart Seek thee—yet there thou dwell'st apart, Oh! Happiness—in thine own sphere, Where naught with thee may interfere! 'Tis the proud province of the mind To make—to frame thee—not to find! SONNET. [Voices, e'en still small voices, seem to rise] Voices, e'en still small voices, seem to rise From this low tomb, with bitterest mockery filled. Well is the Heart, that Seer and Prophet, skilled To interpret them in power!—they say, ye Wise! Ye mighty of the World—clad in the guise Of strength and pride—Oh! ye who featly build Your towering Pyramids!—or as ye willed, And Nature worked, command the giant size Of mountains to subside, and o'er the floods Throw the strong bridge that rides the foamy waves, Or clear for leagues the land of shadowing woods; Have ye forgotten Earth's a field of graves? Your works are mighty, but your haughty moods Must yet be tamed—Death, Death, his victim craves. HADDON HALL. Where are the Hunters, with their green array, Where are the Warriors of the shield and spear, Where are the stately Dames whose costly gear, With jewel-colours flushed the light of day, Where are the Minstrels, with their silvery sway Of honey words—the Paladin and Peer? Where the staunch Yoemen?—where the noble cheer? The hearths, with their yule faggots piled—the gay And courtly Sarabands—the knightly lists— The serenade—the loud reveillée glad? When from the blue hills 'gan to melt the mists, And morning came in pride of beauty clad?— In memory only 'tis the charm exists, Which bids us linger 'midst these hoar walls sad! CHILDHOOD'S MERRIMENT. Merry children, imps of joy, Yours is bliss that cannot cloy, Bliss ye breathe with every breath, Bliss your fancy gendereth, Ever fresh and ever new, Ever changed, yet ever true. Merry children, imps of joy, Days are coming to destroy! Days of doubts and gloomy deeds, To which this path of hours still leads Through shadowy glooms to dark recess, Lost to the light of happiness! Hour doth after hour creep soft, To melt like fleecy clouds aloft; Like vapours vanishing away, Before the smile of perfect day; They thus vanish—but they leave Traces that must make us grieve. Fearful trace and fatal mark, Record dim—memorial dark. That may not thus soon depart, Stamped into the mind and heart. Is it not strange that they should leave, While life's tissued tale they weave, Such dark trace and track behind, On the heart and on the mind. In one soft and silken chain, Seem they link?d to remain; While they gently smoothly blend, Still the same unto the end! So tenderly together bound, What rude, abrupt, surprise profound, Shall make division 'tween them strange, Colouring with dark hues of change? Ah! sorrow comes with them as dew, Comes with the morning's rose-touch'd hue. Ere yet we know 'tis sorrow—Lo! We restless and impatient grow, And anxious, and perturbed by fears, Till all melts in a flow of tears. Then we stand subdued, and know Our dark bosom-inmate—Woe! Hours! ye are but treacherous things, Ye do waft us on your wings— Passing with this patient pace, Together wound in calm embrace. Cankered thoughts and venomed cares, Failing years and hoary hairs, Wearied frame and laboured breath, Darkness, bitterness, and Death— Yet ye seem so softly sped, So tenderly and gently led On your smooth unvarying way, Year by year, as day by day, That we scarcely can believe Ye such webs of wrong can weave! Merry children, elves of joy, Well your happy hours employ, Seize the winged time on its way, Not for you 'twill pause or stay! Hours are false and treacherous things, Wafting dark dooms on their wings; Though so fair they gleam and smile, They bring ten thousand ills the while! Go! and laugh, and shout, and try Your glad speed with the butterfly, Forest-fawn and forest-bee, Young comrades and play-fellows free; Dance and sport—nor fear nor droop, Breathe the rosy air of hope, Dance and sport, and joyous send Your voices' ringing tones to blend With hymn of bird, and hum of bee, And all of nature's melody! Your voices, silvery, sweet are heard, As carol of the sun's glad bird! And, Oh! in nature there is none Of richer, or more rapturous tone! Merry children—imps of joy, Now the sunny hours employ; Hours are coming, dark and deep While ye climb life's frowning steep, These shall chase bright thoughts away, Employ—improve the smiling day! Clouds shall soon come rolling on Where the sun had gladly shone, Angry storms those clouds prepare, 'Stead of pleasure's rosy air! Merry children—imps of joy— Days are coming to destroy Hope's bright bloom and joy's clear ray! Oh! be merry while ye may! O'er the smooth sweet greensward dart, With bounding limb and fearless heart, Sport and smile—and shout and sing— Life's a dark and changeful thing, While upon its sunny side, Take the joys it deigns provide; Soon enough its shadows lower O'er fallen fruit and faded flower,— Soon enough its storms burst dread, O'er ruined bowers and fair leaves shed! Soon must dawn the darker day,— Oh! be happy while ye may! FAIR SEA! Fair Sea! Fair Sea! how brightly now Thou wearest young morning on thy brow, While all thy living things rejoice, With vigour free, without a voice, Shoals of gay dolphins there are sporting, On bluest waves, that seem retorting The sunbeams back unto the sky, With keener, lovelier radiancy! Fair Sea! fair Sea! how brightly now Thou wearest young morning on thy brow, She seems in truth thy child to be, Like Cytherea—sprung from thee; With all her beauty clad victorious, Resplendent with fair aspect glorious! Morning thou seemest brighter even, Glassed by this Sea, than thron'd in Heaven! THE BEAUTIFUL BARQUE! Beautiful Barque!—Beautiful Barque! Thou dost pierce through the sea like a star thro' the dark, Rejoicing thou runnest thy gladsome race, And behind thee thou leav'st but a faint faint trace, Yet thou leavest a deeper trace ev'n there Than the wanderers of earth on her bosom fair! Beautiful Barque, o'er the billows sent, Wild energy seems to thy motion lent, Beneath thee the wave never resting flows, Thou may'st not a moment delay in repose; Yet thy restlessness is as repose, to the strife Of those who are tossed on these dark waves of life! THE WAVES COME SHOREWARDS ROLLING ON. The waves come shorewards rolling on, With dreamy sounds so sweet, They make their audience, the deep heart, In soft response to beat! 'Tis twilight in the fair skies now, And twilight on the sea, And all seems bound in one repose Of perfect calm to be! The waves sink on the yellow shore, On the quiet golden beach, With a whispered, low, self-lullaby, They slumber—all and each. And as they die away, I feel With them my heart half die, Cradled and sepulchred in peace In their monotony! Its troubles and its tortures cease— It lives not its own life, But back reflects fair Nature's guise, And 'scapes from feeling's strife! THE FALLING LEAF. Thou shadower forth of all that e'er hath been, Of all that shall be in this mortal scene— Flit not yet by upon the passing breeze, Circling around the half-denuded trees With thy chill brethren—phantoms of their power, Their pomp—their pride in summer's full blown hour, As though in very mockery to remind Of their dim change—thus fluttering on the wind The shreds and fragments of their rich array, Worn on a fairer, better-fortuned day. Thou shadower forth of all that e'er hath been, Or all that shall be on this mortal scene— Not yet flit by, till I awhile have dwelt On thy deep lessons, and their wisdom felt. Emblem of all earth's children that have past Through various paths to one same bourne at last— Emblem of man—the lord of thought and will, And of his restless generations still— Emblem and shadow of all worlds that are!— Ruled by the self-same laws, as glorious star, Or systems of throng'd stars that sweep and shine, And fill the Universe with light divine, Thundering in music through the firmaments, Each shaping out that course it ne'er repents. A fore-ordained and traced and measured course, Which these fulfil with never failing force— Because, like thee, frail leaf, they but obey The rule infallible—the perfect sway. Oh! would thou wert man's emblem too in this, So the true path he never more might miss— Nor wander in benighted roughen'd way Without a guide too fearfully astray! But his proud heart resisteth still, and turns From paths appointed and avoids and spurns The Heavenly guide too oft that doth not force, But prompts and points to the all perfect course. Oh! let my Soul through this world's wrong and grief, Submit in all things as this helpless leaf! My life—my frame like this must fade and fall, Would that my Soul like it might own thy thrall Oh! thou eeternal law of truth and right, Nor e'er rejoice in rash rebellion's might. A GLOOMY HOUR. 'Twas a tempest of shadows came down on my Soul As I heard the loud torrents unmusical roll, As I mark'd the huge clouds o'er the hoar mountain's brow, That seem'd crushing its loftiness—dark'ning its snow! In its blankness of barrenness frowned the stern scene, (To which deserts were fair, and storm-whirlwinds serene) For so rugged its features, that e'en in repose, As a dread haunt of terror that gloomy scene shows. 'Twas a tempest—a midnight of shadows came down On My Soul's awe-struck silence, whence calm thoughts had flown; As I gazed on that scene in its terrible might, And well might all fair thoughts and visions take flight. There are scenes in Creation where Chaos seems still To put forth his stern power, and to work his harsh will; And, Oh! in this world where such beauty shines fair, How dread frown those scenes, what dire terrors are there. But these too have their uses, their good gracious ends, What an hundred-fold beauty their wild mem'ry lends To thy fairer forms, Nature! which ever appear, With these horrors contrasted more witching and dear. AWAY! OH, AWAY! Away! Oh, away! o'er the bounding waves, Since my heart the wild freshness of ocean craves; For the land, for the land, it wearieth those Who have but cold apathy's gloom for repose! On the dark bounding waves, Oh! away then, away, On the shore let the happy and hopeful ones stay; The restless, the wretched, the hopeless must fly To the wild rolling waves—to the swift clouding sky. The strife of their souls they must seek to forget, In the stern strife of nature, and yet—surely yet— It were better to battle with sorrow and care— Not to shun, not to leave, but to meet it and bear! THE MOON'S LIGHT. How lovely this calm eve! the clouds flock by, Like gorgeous pageants through the enkindled sky, Those rosy and these silvery—tyrian some— Such hues as make the daylight look like gloom Compared with them!—yon bright one seems piere'd thro', As though with barb?d sunbeams till the blue Around seems stained with its ethereal blood, (E'en in our sight, for many a skyey rood.) Turned ruddy there!—how soon, serenely soon Shall the World whiten to the pearl-browed Moon, As both were spheres of silver without stain, Nor one bright tint of the veiled Sun retain! As though he were forgotten in that hour Of softer influence and of gentler power, And yet—Oh! glorious Sun! it is thy light That streams—e'en then in holy lustre bright, From the star-peopled and fair vaulted Sky— Beauteous in soft and trembling radiancy! That lovely Moon is but a precious urn, Wherein thy glittering treasures brightly burn, And she but gives us what thou giv'st to her— Thy handmaid fair, and Queenly Minister!— 'Tis thus, when we bright gifts of good receive, To which we still with fond devotion cleave, In this our passing life of visions vain— Of troubled pleasures and o'er ruling pain, Our hearts forget from whence they deeply spring, And deem these objects visible must bring— (And more than bring—must furnish and supply, And bless us with their rich sufficiency!) The wealth we grasp so fondly—nor confess They are but the almoners of Happiness!— For us on Earth, from higher source must come Each joy attending thus our mortal doom! We still forget the Sun we do not see— Though thence our light must come unchangeably! DEAR WILD FLOWERS. Dear Wild Flowers of the new-born welcome Spring, Here ye unfold in early blossoming! For 'tis a sheltered spot, and warm and still— So guarded by the closely fencing hill; It little knows of storms and blighting airs: E'en Winter here his rougher guise forbears, And soft blooms here anticipate the Spring, And many birds rise gladly on the wing, From its sweet covert filling air and sky With joy, and life, and thrilling melody. 'Tis an enchanted spot, and fair and bright! And Spring doth well here first in smiles to alight— And cradle her amidst its calms serene, For well the season suiteth with the scene. Nought stern nor rugged here may meet the eye— Its features are like those of Infancy, All softly moulded with a tender grace, Each faintly traced, yet forming Love's own face! A mild and seraph-beauty, that charms more Than prouder graces which we bend before! Dear Scene! that brings back to my tearful view Old days, old dreams—yet dearer than the new— Sink deep into my heart, and Oh! stamp there, (Where long hath brooded dark and sleepless care,) Unchanged beneath whatever changing sky, Thine—and the image of tranquillity! TO THE BUTTERFLY. Butterfly! gladly I watch thee, now— Like an incarnate breeze art thou— Oh! Butterfly—late in the sunny air Borne buoyantly on, all bright and fair— Child of the Summer!—child of the Sun! His loveliest, lightest, and happiest one! And now, Oh! thou free-born wanderer, now On the stately lily's smooth snowy brow, Dost thou in sculpture-like stillness rest, While burns o'er its whiteness thy dazzling vest? And soon wilt thou dart through the air again— Flashing round thee, with many a jewel stain, And float on the sunbeam, and swim in light, Like an embodied thought in sight! So fine, so free, so sudden, and swift— Fleeting, fleeting away like a fairy gift; And then again shalt thou rest thee calm, On some rose's leaflets of beauty and balm? Butterfly! thou art as restless as man, In his narrow path, in his straightened span! Thus doth he evermore shift his place, And now pause—now speed, on his troubled race: But, Oh! glad Butterfly! not like thee, In a stream of sunshine careering free; And not like thee, still from flower to flower, From the sunny glade to the sunny bower— He mourneth on—but from rock to rock, Barren and frowning—his vain hope to mock!— From desert to desert—from gloom to gloom, Till he ends at length with the shadowy tomb! TWILIGHT AND PEACE. The dreaming twilight's languishment Was brooding o'er the scene, And Day and Night seemed mingling there, In shadows and in sheen! O'er bank, and brook, and festooned bower, That spread before my sight, Were shed, in that delicious hour,— A darkness and a light! It was not night—it was not day— 'Twas something dearer far— And nothing sudden—nothing strange, That perfect calm might mar! Oh! could this holy light be shed About us evermore— Surely sin might not darkly tread Earth's desecrated floor. So pure, so clear, so tender 'tis— So exquistely dear; Holier and holier must become Our rent and troubled sphere. Oh! no—not thus expelled might be, The stains and strifes of sin— A different light for that must shine On the deep Soul within. Too soon doth man accustomed grow To all that strikes his sense; No mighty benefits might spring, No perfect good from thence. The outward World too much receives The inward World's fixed tone; Did man not ruin and destroy That Eden, once his own? STANZAS. [How cheerily come the mingled voices] How cheerily come the mingled voices Of bird, and of breeze, and bee; And my heart with hope elate rejoices, And joins their harmony. Oh! nothing is like the raptured beating Of a bounding bounding heart; All nature's happiest tones repeating, Mine Own!—even such thou art. Oh! brightly for me ev'n now are pouring Hope's own golden fountains free; And those, the past by joys restoring— The founts of memory! All the founts of hope and memory brightly Are for me full pouring now; And my heart beats lovingly and lightly, And cloudless is my brow! Oh! Nature this, this is thy fair doing, Thou dost chase vain cares away! The soul with triumphant voices wooing, To rise above its clay. And then it forgets its weak lamenting, And it turns from fear and pain, To mingle with a rich assenting In thy delightful strain. All thy pure joys and thy charms surrounding Our steps—and our souls shed light O'er bosoms erst with cares abounding, And chill'd by sorrow's blight! Welcome this deep and this sweet forgetting Of ills, and of woes, and fears; The Sun of Life will soon be setting— Quench not its beam with tears! Look round—'twere most sinful to be slighting Fair Nature! thy joyous pride As thy delights were undelighting, Far spread and scattered wide! Oh! nothing is like the raptured beating Of a bounding bounding heart— All Nature's happiest tones repeating, Mine!—Mine!—ev'n such thou art! THE SAGE'S HERITAGE. Dreams at once too dark too bright, A smothering gloom—a blinding light— Thoughts too soaring and too deep For life to know or hope to keep— Longings not to be fulfilled— Emotions that are hardly stilled— These things—ev'n from youth to age, These are the Poet's Heritage! A fire that smoulders in the breast, An inward storm—a wild unrest— In the hours of peace, fond pinings vain, To taste the joy of strife again— In the hours of strife, a phrenzied burst Of wildest impulses and worst— These with ambition's fevered rage, These are the Warrior's Heritage. Conflicting doubts—corroding cares, Which ill the impatient spirit bears, The injurious World's calumnious wrongs— The assault of evil thoughts and tongues— And many a strange vicissitude, From shiftings of man's varying mood— These things, revealed on History's page, These are the Statesman's Heritage. Bright days of peace and nights of sleep, Bless'd with dreams and visions deep, A Hope that hath no check no bound, That clasps Eternity around— A light that lives within the Soul, Yet gilds Heaven's systems as they roll!— These, these things, meek and thoughtful Sage, These, these are thy bright Heritage! AWAY THEN TO THE FESTAL SCENE. Away then to the Festal Scene, Be the garlands plucked and wreathed, Be the light words conned, the gay smiles worn, So may thought's keen sword be sheathed! Away then to the Festal Scene, Where the joyous throngs are met, There are two lessons I would learn— To hope—and to forget! To hope—if but for breathless peace, And to forget stern pain— These lessons I would fain, fain learn, Again and oft again! I do not ask for happiness, I know not what it means, And I doubt not 'tis a stranger too, To those gay hurrying scenes. Oh! still to me so oft, so long By restless sorrows torn, Rich happiness a jewel seems, Too costly to be worn! Methinks I evermore should fear, Lest Time, dread thief, should come And snatch it from my fond embrace, And seal my hapless doom. Oh! unto me so oft, so long By doubts and sufferings torn, Rich happiness a jewel seems, Too costly to be worn! But pleasure brings a little flower, A little fragile flower, And I will bind it on my heart, In her own smiling bower. Not over-precious to the Soul, Not fraught with wealth's excess, It may not tempt the Spoiler's touch, Like thee, bright Happiness! THE WARRIOR'S FUNERAL. A Warrior's funeral stern and sad Went gleaming through the night, And the wind-waved torches reddening glared With a wild and fitful light. 'Twas a Warrior, dauntless in the field, And fearless of the foe! But shield nor spear might serve to ward, Death! Death! thy certain blow! With their arms reversed and muffled drum, They bore him to his grave, Thrice clanged the peal of musquetry, Be blessings on the brave! What shall the Warrior's trophies be? Place, place the banner near, Let the plumed helm hang proud beside, And the threatening sword and spear. Let the Eagle, bird of victory bold, Be sculptured fairly there, So shall the dim sepulchral hall An air of triumph wear! Nay! there no warlike trophies place, 'Twere veriest mockery all— In the chamber of unbroken peace, Cold Death's sepulchral hall! Enough of bitterness and wrath, Of restlessness and strife, Attend our painful labour'd steps, Through the steepy paths of life. Why should we seek, Oh! Holy Peace! Thy solemn show to chase From the precincts of the silent tomb, The undreaming slumber's place? No marvel! when through life we strive, With weak and senseless arts, As though it were our one chief aim, To chase thee from our hearts! THE GHASTLY GUEST. Who, who hath not some ghastly guest In the locked chambers of his breast, Some cherished sorrow that still keeps Beside him when he wakes or sleeps— Some haunting memory that remains Through all his future joys and pains, Like some dark turbid current led Where wild woods wave, or fair fields spread? Who, who hath not some ghastly guest In the closed chambers of his breast— As legends old have fabled oft, While the red wine-cup's draught was quaff'd, The loud laugh laughed, the sweet song sung, The walls with garland-streamers hung, And lamps were lit, and gay tales told, And the hours on golden wheels seem'd roll'd. Appeared for evermore aright, The phantom to some haunted sight, Before some doomed and hapless guest, For ever barred from peace and rest! While none but he could feel or mark The spectre's shadowing presence dark; Could mark the phantom's threat'ning mien, By him alone—him only seen! Still so it is with us—for few May pass Life's gloomy mazes through— Without some dim and ghastly guest Becoming the inmate of their breast! Whether they smile, or sigh, or weep, Whether they wake, or wearied sleep— That guest remaineth by their side, By no eye but their own descried, Deep in their secret Soul concealed, By none perceived—to none revealed. And when they seek Death's shadowy cave, Buried with them in one same grave. I DO NOT CHIDE THEE. I do not chide thee, and I do not blame, Fear not that I can ever speak thy name, And mingle with it one upbraiding tone— No! no! though thus by thy harsh will undone! I loved thee—I may not ev'n try to tell How warmly, wildly, worshippingly well; I loved thee—and the world became to me One sunny dream—one deep felicity! I find thee false, farewell to joy and hope, I feel my heart grow chill, my spirit droop; I hate that world which seemed so bright to be, Myself I hate, but still—but still—love thee! I cannot chide thee—Oh! I cannot blame, With prayers—tears—blessings—I must breathe thy name, I will not think e'en one upbraiding thought— But love thee on till love and life are nought! Forgive this failing form, this fading face, If there thou should'st reproach and suff'ring trace; And, Oh! believe the heart within but grows Devoted more and more unto the close. That fades not, fails not, but concentered there, In one wild gush of passion and despair— Seem all Life's deepest energies to be— I die!—but let my death reproach not thee! DREAMS! Dreams! through th' immortal—the infinite— Ye pass on your free way; Ye are our spirit's rich escapes From the thraldom of its clay! Oh! a wilderness of mysteries 'tis With fearless foot we tread, What time your halo Heav'n-light streams Around the pillowed head. All the universe's glorious gates Are opened by your key— The denizons of Sun and Star Ye proudly seem to be! Dreams! through the Immortal—the Infinite— You range on your free way, And lift our Spirits far beyond The realms of mortal day! Ye come like Angels to our Souls (That visit Earth no more) I' the midnight's silence, stern and deep, To teach us Heavenly lore. Beneath your fair and mystic reign New Beings we become, And seem already wafted high To our future Starry Home! Through your enchanted dazzling maze Philosophers have strayed, And owned your mystery's wond'rous spell, And thus been wiser made! They have confessed how vain their skill To unravel paths like yours, Where bloom, like that of Paradise, For evermore endures! The iron-hearted warrior grows A child beneath your sway— And fancies mild as moonlight beams Through his softened Spirits play. Dreams!—Dreams!—ye are strong with whirlwind strength, Yet sweet as breeze of May, Ye deck Creation's imaged form In a new and bright array. Ye make the Soul—the Universe, On its own self enthroned!— Girded with garments of the Light— With starry systems zoned! Dreams! through the Immortal—the Infinite Your glorious way ye take— Nay—the Immortal and the Infinite— The Soul ye haunt—ye make! A BEAUTIFUL SCENE. Beautiful Scene! I know not why I look on thee—and look and sigh; Though thou remind'st me of the Spring That now around my home doth fling Beauty, freshness, hope, delight, Glowing exquisite and bright— Thou but remind'st to bring regret, 'Twere wiser, better to forget! Remind me, rather, loveliest Scene! So placid, smiling, and serene, With deeper power, with nobler might, With finer influence of delight, Of that fair Land—the unknown Land, Whose glorious scenes far off expand, That Land which lies beyond the tomb— The country of immortal bloom; Of that Eternal Home above, Lit by the living light of Love! For such thy beauty is, I deem, 'Tis like some Heaven-commissioned dream, Sent e'en within the heart, to wake Longings and desires that break The thousand petty wretched ties That bind us to Earth's vanities! Oh! lovely Scene! I know not why I still look on thee but to sigh— And yet, methinks the truth I guess, And trace the cause of this distress; Thou dost remind me of my home, Like thee now clad in Spring's fair bloom, And thou remind'st me deeply too Of loved ones, to whose memory true, And true to whose dear love this heart Must be—together or apart! A thought of those sweet absent friends, With all my thoughts for ever blends, And still I turn with constant mind To all that I have left behind! And wheresoe'er I wandering rove— Still feel, still keep one changeless love! And yet I give thee too thy due, Oh! Nature—with devotion true, Nor turn a cold and careless eye On thy o'erpowering witchery! Nor with an untouched heart can greet Those charms of thine which still I meet In this delicious land of light, Where Beauty liveth in the sight. No! in the face of Earth and Skies, New admirations still arise In this enchanted clime which hues Of Heaven itself, must sure suffuse! No!—in my heart for ever now New admirations kindling glow— Where'er I turn, where'er I move— But one—one only—self-same Love! BONDS OF UNION. I sate in that sweet bower apart—alone, 'Twas spring-time, and the season was made known By voices, music-voices in the woods— That might have soothed a cynic's crabbed moods— Charmed wild despair and won it unto peace, And bade the fury of the wrathful cease— By bloom upon the dyed and gleaming ground, And vernal freshness ev'rywhere around. But close at hand with its deep awful gloom, Was a stern place of silence and the tomb— Spring smiled too there—each blade of grass appeared Fresher and fairer, as she gently cleared The darkness from the face of Earth away, And lent her smile and blush to glowing day. Then came those old thoughts on my saddened Mind, Which millions have revolved before—not blind To those deep startling contrasts that are found For ever on this checquered mortal ground! Wreathed coils of meaning—contradictions strange, Which vex the mind with a perpetual change,— Which still seem woven with all things below,— Whate'er we meet, or mark, or find, or know!— Who ever stood beside a silent grave, In that sweet time when boughs new leafing wave, And flowers their course of beauty have begun— The innocent worshippers of the orient Sun, And birds are filling all the echoing air With that pure music, ever rich and rare, Beyond all cunning instruments' wrought strains, Though framed with curious skill and artful pains— Who ever stood beside a silent tomb, In that sweet season of gay song and bloom, Nor felt the mystery of our Life and Death Chilling his blood and choaking up his breath? The fresh glad face of Nature, bright and fair, Without a shade of gloom or trouble there! Beneath—the darkness of the dread decay— Nature still fixed—Man passing still away! Oh! these are things that ever smite the Mind, Appealing to the hearts of all Mankind! Perchance 'twas purposed these should strongly be The alarums of the general sympathy! These few strange startling truths that wake in all Accordant answers to their fearful call!— For startling truths—awe-striking things alone, With voice of terror and unearthly tone, Can pierce that apathy of dull repose, Which mails our hearts, where still it spreads and grows; Till on the sudden thus 'tis rent away, And they the influence and the call obey. And, Oh! these things whose universal thrall, Whose general influence is confessed by all, Together draw us, and must ever be The watchwords of the general sympathy; And this is good for man—to love, to feel, To break inveterate Selfishness' cold seal, To wake from dull Indifference, and to own Man is not here on this fair Earth alone! We think old thoughts, we feel old feelings still, And tread but in old paths, through good and ill, A touching bond of union evermore, With us and all that have gone on before— We think the thoughts of others, and we feel The feelings too of others, grief or zeal, Or doubt, hope, joy, or wonder, which e'en now Thousands around us—millions must avow. And blessed are those things which deepliest wake The accordant sympathies—for Love's high sake— Blessed the things which cause old thoughts to spring, Old common thoughts, that with their presence bring A tenderer Charity for all our kind, A sense of holier love—in heart and mind. Bless'd be those things, though mournful they may be, Which kindle the universal sympathy. FAILURES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS. Many a tired tired bird hath dropped and died Beneath the wrath of that fierce Storm, which tried Its frail strength to the utmost, long before It gained its nest's dear shelter, covered o'er With skreening boughs in some calm covert deep, Where storms were lulled, like charmed things, to sleep, And on the cold ground sunk to breathless rest, Far from the happy shelter of that nest. Many a Pilgrim hath sunk down before He hailed the Shrine, at which he hoped to pour Devotion's prayers and Feeling's raptured tears, A meed for all the sufferings of long years. Many a flower hath been o'erborne by Death, Ere yet the breeze grew fragrant with its breath— Ere yet to full blown pride it had attained, And in the brightness of its beauty reigned. Many a precious gem too hath been lost, Ere in the sumptuous chain of mighty cost, Or in the glorious crown 'twas proudly set, Where other gems in rainbowed splendour met— Many a rill, in Summer's sultry hour Of wasting influence, and of scorching power, Hath been dried up upon its murmuring way To those fair sister-streams that warbling stray— Along their smiling course, as glad as fair, Though that may perish in the parching glare! And many a heart hath been with anguish torn, And darkly bruised—and with sharp sufferings worn, And crushed and broken long before its time, And chilled and withered in the unkindliest clime, Of this rough bitter World; then what of thee, Poor mournful heart! that sighest “Woe is me!” Aye! many a Heart before its meed was one, Hath ruined been, and blighted and undone, Before its rest—before its goal was gained, In every pulse with every torture pained! Then what of thee!—Ah! answer—what of thee? Poor trembling Heart, that sighest “Woe is me!” LINES TO ?. [Thou hast struggled—thou hast sorrowed—] Thou hast struggled—thou hast sorrowed— Thou whose look a deep tale tells; Thou from Fancy's stores hast borrowed Wealth to line thy heart's void cells! Thou hast languished, thou hast lingered On the lengthening road of life; And the lyre which thou hast fingered Speaks of sorrows and of strife. Thou hast lingered, thou hast languished, And thy deepest heart hath been Sternly wrung, and sorely anguished, On this troubled earthly scene. Thou hast loved, and hast lamented, Well I trace it in thy strain; Thou hast hoped, feared, sighed, repented, And thou'lt yet do thus again. Natures like thine own, for ever With such fervour—with such force, Know the pangs of vain endeavour— Passion, Sorrow, and Remorse. Thou hast struggled, thou hast sorrowed, Still misled by visioned beams, Till thy soul is scored and furrowed, Half the world's slave, half thy dream's!— From the world turn wholly, wholly, Or but leave thy dream behind, For 'tis phrenzy, it is folly, To think the twain can be entwined. These dreams of beauty and of glory Visiting the poet's brain, They vanish by the trite, dull story Of this dark world's vile cares and vain. This world, too, darker must be seeming With such visions bright compared, Be all devoted to that dreaming, Or all in those close toils ensnared. Oh! from the world turn wholly, wholly, Or wholly deeply to thy dreams! Is not their glorious melancholy Fairer than Life's best loveliest gleams? Thou hast languished—thou hast lingered On the lengthening road of Life, And the sweet lute thou hast fingered, Speaks of suffering still and strife! A DREAM OF DEATH. It was a lovely dream—a vision deep, That more belonged to waking than to sleep— A form I saw more beautiful than Night, When she is cinctured with her Star-zone bright, And lovely in her blue transparent gloom, As Noontide's flush, or Morning's golden bloom! Bright with a solemn brightness, while we trace Nature's great Soul of Beauty in her face! Her shadowy, yet her lighted face of love, The shadows are beneath—the stars above! While all on Earth doth indistinct appear, And all in Heaven irradiate shines and clear. A lovely form I saw—a voice I heard, And all my Soul was wakened, and was stirred. A melody of echoes seemed that voice, And still it cried “Rejoice!”—and still “Rejoice!” I felt—I knew—the form was Death—crown'd Death! The pale, pale Angel!—there no hue nor breath Might speak of Life—no pulse was beating there, 'Twas spiritually, spiritlessly fair! For still 'twas Spirit-like, and still it seemed As though no light of Being's truth there beamed. I knew the voice was Death's—the faint faint voice That cried “Rejoice!”—and yet again “Rejoice.” THE SONG OF DEATH. “Rejoice!—Oh! Earth! that I am near, Oh! shrink not from my rule with fear; 'Tis merciful, impartial, too— Solemn and peaceful—just and true. All ye who suffer and who sigh, Dream ye it can be hard to die? Look on each guest of mine, each guest That dwells in never-broken rest. Earth's children, ye have groaned in pain, Follow, follow in my train! “Maiden—come with all thy charms, Come from love's fond deep alarms— Treachery thou shalt fear no more; No doubt shall pierce thy young heart's core, Thy smile shall melt not thus to tears. Come—come in these thy rosy years, Come ere the bitter word be breathed, And love's flower-crowns fade disenwreath'd. Thee to my bosom will I take, Follow—follow in my wake! “Monarch! from thy throne descend, Thee will I ev'n yet befriend; Thou has known what 'tis to bear Mortal grief—and mortal care— Thou hast seldom had for guest Peace—the halcyon of the breast. Come with all the good thou'st done, Deep awful duties gird the throne! Come! lay down thy gilded chain, Follow—follow in my train! “Mourner! come away—away— Now come to thy beloved clay! Thou hast pined, and thou hast wept For the dearly loved that slept! Thou hast languished day and night For thy deep Soul's lost delight— I, and only I, can now Unite the parted!—hasten thou, For thy own beloved one's sake. Follow—follow in my wake. Dreamer! thou hast soared from Earth— From thy place of mortal birth; Ever fired with longings deep, Harvests nobler far to reap Than those that can be gathered here, On this dim and clouded sphere, Dreamer! canst thou fear me? thou! With Vision-haloes round thy brow, Come and find thy dreams not vain, Follow—follow in my train. Wanderer—try a calmer shore, Than thou e'er hast trod before. Come, come with bare unsandelled foot, Where fall the footsteps faint and mute— Bring no scrip and bring no staff, All Earth's treasures there are chaff. Wanderer—come with me, where land Doth after land in light expand, Where heavenly Founts thy thirst shall slake, Follow—follow in my wake. Statesman lay aside thy cares, Thou'rt one of mine, and Slumber's heirs; Thou, even thou too, shalt repose, Life's long turmoil-scenes shall close; Thy vexed toils shall cease at last, Thou'lt forget vain struggles past, Hours of dark embosomed Strife, Hours of troubled fevered Life— Come, where Peace and Silence reign, Follow—follow in my train!” EARTH'S WEARY ONES. Ye Weary Ones of this fair Earth, Whose hearts are lone, whose hopes are gone, How bear ye all its sheen and mirth; Oh! ye whose day of joy is done. Ye wake indeed to Life and Morn; But Life and Light to others dear, Ah! how can they by them be borne, To whom they bring but pain and fear. Life, Life and Light, can they be borne By hearts and eyes, which sighs and tears, (Which still complain—and idly mourn,) Have wrung and agonized for years? Ye Weary Ones of this fair Earth, Whose hearts are lone, whose hopes are gone, How bear ye with its sheen and mirth, That make ye doubly feel undone! Its mirth and light will pass away— 'Twill yet on ye, ere long, bestow A darkness never chased by Day, A stillness ne'er disturbed below. LINES FROM A MS. POEM. Once more to look upon those Soul-like eyes, To see the train of thoughts there kindling rise, In Beauty-breathing rich development, As though mysteriously thus brightly blent, With their own living beauty e'en to show How elements to elements may flow! If such indeed the light of thought may be Rare Essence, which is all unchained and free, And yet that eye itself as wonderous seems, A Sun of pure and spiritual beams; Thought cannot finer be than that keen ray Which ever seems with more than life to play. How wonderously entwin'd in unity The Worlds of Soul and Substance seem to be! Even thus, with rarest subtlety indeed, A strange, and sweet, and dream-compelling creed Ne'er framed before suggesting to the mind, Such vague and mystic creed by fancy twined, As thought can scarce well compass—and still less Can words of laboured language e'er express, That ever fail at need to speak and show Our finest feelings—loveliest dreams below! DEEP IN THY DARK, DARK EYE. Deep in thy dark, dark eye Dwells the soul-light of love, Whose beams flash brightly by Like meteor's rays above. Soft in thy voice' sweet tone, Speaks the rich breath of love, Soft as melodious moan Of waves that shorewards move. Bright in thy blushes' bloom Glows love's own roseate hue, The sun-set skies assume Tints lovelier to the view. But, oh! methinks that eye More beautiful appears, When half its brilliancy Is quenched by trembling tears. Love speaks through these yet more Than through the brightest rays; 'Tis then I most adore, And think unuttered praise. Methinks that voice so soft, Hath less of music's tone Than sighs that faintly waft Love's truth, thus sweetest shown! And, oh! those faultering sighs From thy heart's silence sent— My very Soul surprise With Passion's languishment! Thy blushes brightest glow Seems not so fair to me, As paleness' moonlight snow— Love's tenderest livery! THE SKY-LARK NOW. The sky-lark now divinely tunes To greet the birth of day, In paroxysm of ecstasy! His wild triumphant lay. In paroxysm of ecstasy, His glorious lay he trills, While Morning speaks sublimely out, Like a trumpet to the hills! Like a sudden trumpet to the hills, And the wide rejoicing plains, Where the sparkling fragrant dews glance quick, Like the trace of golden rains. The Majesty of Light comes forth, On his mighty chariot throne— And he comes forth from his Eastern Hall, Approachless and alone! And at once the world seems filled with him, And grows a vision bright— The Air is Sun—The Earth is Sun— The Soul lives in his Light! Still on the wings of Morning borne, Man's rushing thoughts ascend— With Angel-hymns their silent praise, Ev'n then they surely blend! For Morning ever seems to come From the radiant courts above— A sweet Ambassadress sent down On mission deep of love! SORROW AND JOY. Oh! Sorrow! on thy face I long have looked—long gazed! I own its tearful grace, When th' envious veil is raised. I can resemblance trace— Sorrow! thou sweet Saint-Queen!— In that pathetic face, To young Joy's radiant mien. Sister and Sister, ye— Oh! ye're allied too near! Large is that family, Which doth embrace ye here! Hope, Fear, Doubt, Triumph, Love— Brethren and sisters are With thee—Oh! mournful dove! And Joy that lighteneth far. Doubt, Hope, Love, Triumph, Fear, Brethren and sisters are With thee—faint Hesperus dear, And that divine twin-star! Each hath some likeness too, Unto the others all— They're one fond band and true, Bound by some mystic thrall! Each hath some likeness too, Unto each other one! They're bound by ties too true, For aye, beneath the Sun! DAYS GONE BY. Oh! happy days gone by—alas! gone by, Too dearly valued, and too swiftly flown; The light and music of their memory Still make the life in which I live alone. The music of their memory and the light, Yet charm yet captivate my heart and soul; The past is mine—with moonlight radiance bright— Unfold dark map of Life—dull chart unroll. I stand on mountain-heights of Memory's Strength, And o'er a broad-developed prospect gaze, What though around frown desert wilds at length, I view afar Joy's sunny flowery maze. I stand on Memory's wave-defying rock, The fret of billows chafes it at its base— I stand and brave the still recurring shock, They shall not move me from my steadfast place. Hope—Hope from my calm presence I rebuke, I know her flatteries and her falsehoods well— With frown averse, and cold and scornful look, I turn from her—with Memory fixed to dwell! AN INFANT'S FUNERAL. It was a young Child's funeral—'twas the day Of Holy Sabbath calm—the Sun's broad ray Shed fulness of all beauty's pomp around, And spread an orient garment o'er the ground. It was the spot where lay—with slumber blessed, Thickly the Village Fathers round at rest! At rest from all their toils and all their cares, Safe from life's storms and bitter blighting airs, And thou borne earthward's, in young bloom art gone To thy sweet early rest, poor little one! Ill fated Child!—ill fated?—Nay! not so, Far happier than the millions left below To struggle on through all the restless strife, The trouble and the weariness of life. Ill fated Child? Oh! blessed beyond all thought, Thy fate indeed with Heaven's own grace was fraught; Oh! bless'd beyond expression, bless'd indeed— Thy heart shall never learn to ache and bleed, Never thine eye look through a mist of tears, To see the vista of long-suffering years— Never thy head droop down, as though no more To be upraised:—down borne by burthens sore. Elect of Death, his favoured fondling thou, Whither hath he conducted thee e'en now? Whither?—why who shall dream?—Who, who, shall say, Thus much at least we know—from Earth away— From all her sorrows, all her deadly wrongs, The danger that to all her paths belongs, The heavy trial and the bitter blames— The stings—the sins—the sufferings—and the shames— Unto a place of gladness and of peace, Where tears are wiped away, and trials cease. Whither?—why who shall say?—Not she who stoops O'er that paled blossom of her Mother-hopes! She nothing knows of the new distant home, Sweet floweret, gathered in thine opening bloom— She nothing knows of thine abiding-place, Now thou hast run thy little measured race— Dear Child! though 'twas a brief short while ago, Upon her loving bosom!—wan with woe She leans above the dust where thou art laid, Bewildered—sorrowing—hopeful—yet afraid; The poor pale Mother—Oh! she nothing knows Of where now blooms her sweet half-budded rose— Nor he, the silent Father, whose strong arm Was nerved to guard thee 'gainst all wrong and harm— Prompt to extend defence and aid to thee— Most vigorous in that service fond and free! He who still set his rugged hand to toil— And taught his brow beneath June-Suns to broil— For thee—his lovely lamb—his blithesome bird— Who in his breast all founts of feelings stirred. Nothing he knoweth of where now thou art, Save by the passionate guesses of his heart— The little lamb that had not time to stray, Ere the keen knife drank its sweet life away; Is it not gathered to the hallowed fold? Oh! bend not thus above the insensate mould! Bend, bend not thus above the unconscious dust, To the Great Shepherd that loved lamb entrust! In His divinest presence entered now— Immortal life smiles beaming from its brow— Poor father—weeping mother—turn away From ashes, and from dust and senseless clay, Think not of that dear infant as beneath, The rule and sway of ruthless gloomy Death. But think of it as in the love and care Of Heaven's high grace, and all the Angels there! All angel too itself—to death, to pain, Never to stoop nor subject be again! 'Twere for Earth's mightiest ones the happiest doom To exchange their place of pride for thy calm tomb! THE VISION. 'Twas a vision of rapture that rushed on my Soul, Profound and unmatched and supreme, In its glory and beauty and transports of might, A wildering and world-kindling dream! 'Twas existence within, 'twas existence without, 'Twas a life without barrier or bound, For my thoughts with the lightnings and wild winds careered And yet searched the Soul's veiled depths profound. 'Twas delirious delight and consummate content, And 'twas then first their fulness I knew! And I felt 'twas the presence of joy in my Soul— A joy cloudless and perfect and true. Could we live in such visions how glorious were life, How starry—how flow'ry its way— How smoothed all its roughness, how charm'd all its strife— But how mournful when Death claimed his prey! How darkly the tomb should frown, reared at the close Of a vista so dazzling and fair! And however that vista might glowingly shine, The Tomb must be darkly reared there! THE MARRIAGE PEAL AND PASSING BELL. 'Twas yestermorn a marriage bell rang loud, And spoke of joy unto the listening crowd; And now a solemn passing bell I hear Startling the air,—the neighbouring smile and tear Do thus efface each other, Life and Death, (The one stretched stark, the other breathing breath Of joy, and hope, and promise evermore, As though none e'er will die, e'er died before) Jostle each other in these crowded streets— Young Bride! for whom life hath but flowers and sweets, When yestermorn, with blushing cheek and brow, Thou stood'st at the altar breathing Love's deep vow, How deemedst thou that Love could never die— That Earth was Paradise—Eternity— That bell saith other things—brings other news, And withers up Hope's fairest freshest hues. It tells the universal tale of man, How short his journey, and how small his span, He breathes his troubled hour of hurried breath, To augment thy Trophy pile of ashes—Death! THE SINKING SUN. The Sun is sinking—red he sinks among His golden Paradise of cloud-wreathed bowers; Oh! fairer hours than when from th' East he sprung— Magnificent—though melancholy hours! Those clouds, like Coronation robes flung off By some proud King—thick robes of tissued gold— Or regal tyrian, or thick jewelled stuff, Lie scattered far o'er Heaven's bright face—behold! The Earth, and Air, and Heavens, in their broad cope, Are stained with blood-red tint of deepest dye; The gates of other worlds seem now to ope, And pour on ours a strange resplendency! Who praises pearl-crowned morning? She is fair, But like the snow-wreath pale, near this broad fire: Who can her smile with these rich tints compare, That proudly blazon forth Day's funeral-pyre? Oh! Sunset-Hours! thus dyed with royal red, Gorgeous, yet mournful, o'er our world do ye A rich illustrious melancholy shed, That ever seems its fitliest pall to be! NOTHING, NOTHING E'ER IS LOST. Clouds, how fleetly pass ye still, Floating over wood or hill, Winged and driven with wild, wild haste, Wherefore, Clouds, thus swiftly chased? Whither do ye go so fast? What shall be your goal at last? Oh! ye hurrying haste along, But to ruin—vapoury throng! Ye shall melt and be no more— All your restless wanderings o'er;— Nothing lasts, and nothing stays— All in Nature's World decays! Yet, ye Clouds, in silvery showers, Fall ye not to bless the flowers? To empearl and to make fresh the grass, To ensure the harvests while ye pass? Oh! Nature! in thy World so fair— Death is a true wizard there; Nothing, nothing wholly dies— Each thing passes, changes, flies! Nothing, nothing e'er is lost! Such is Nature's noblest boast; Nothing, nothing wholly dies, Each thing changes—passes—flies! Leaves! how soon ye fade and fall, Nor more your vernal tints recall; Strewing mournfully around, With your fairy wrecks, the ground. Ye that Nature's Summer-court, Richly decked—become the sport Of wildwinds on their ruthless way, That with ye pitilessly play. Ye that with your emerald dyes, Your fair and fluttering tapestries, Decked the scene—become the prey Of wild winds on their howling way! Ye lie strewn the heaped ground o'er, That ye checquered fair before, Playing as some soft cloud plays With the dazzling sunny rays! Ye shall dead and withered lie, Bough-stripped leaves and sere and dry; Nothing lasts and nothing stays, All in Nature's world decays! Ye fallen leaves! that strew the ground— Heap ye not rich mould around— Do not ye indeed become Parents of new worlds of bloom? Oh! Nature, in thy world so fair, Death's a wizard—nothing there— Nothing, nothing wholly dies, Each thing changes, shifts, and flies. This is Nature's noblest boast, Nothing, nothing e'er is lost; Nothing's lost, and nothing dies, Each thing changes, shifts, and flies. And Man—the master-piece and crown Of all her works—shall he sink down— Lost in ashes and in dust?— Oh! win and hold a higher trust. Easier 'twere to think this World In shrouds of change so strangely furled, Is dead and lost—day after day— While its fair things fade away! And because pass clouds and leaves, While each a different shape receives, To think that the Old World is no more, All its breath and being o'er. Great Nature! in thy World so bright, Death's a Wizard-Lord of Might! Nothing wholly fails or dies, Each thing changes, shifts, and flies. This is Nature's noblest boast, Nothing, nothing e'er is lost, Least of all then, he the pride Of all her works—Man—Heaven-allied! Nothing, nothing ever dies! Each thing changes, shifts, and flies; Man! Death subjects thy poor clay Himself to feel thy Soul's proud sway! HOW GLAD THIS HEART. How glad this heart was in the days of old, No thorns might pierce it, and no shades enfold, It sprung exulting, throbbing full and high, To heights, and loftier heights of joyauncy! But such bright state of bliss was not to last, Soon fled the illusions, soon the gladness passed; The fair delights—the expectancies more fair, Vanished like vapours—shapes and dreams of air! Life's rose leaves overhung a fatal stream, And they have dropped therein, no more to beam In blushful beauty—delicately bright— And breathe around one atmosphere of light. Hope, like a dream, thou'rt gone—lost, lost, art thou But memory's many voices sternly now The deep and melancholy hush invade Like trumpets thrilling through the old midnight shade! Those many voices, many echoes wake In the torn heart that will not, cannot break; Would they were silent! that they ne'er shall be— Till life itself is lost with memory! How glad this heart was in the olden days, But gladness fleeteth—nought but sorrow stays; Joy is a butterfly—short lived and frail— But grief's a nightingale that lives to wail. How glad my heart was in the days of yore, From heights to loftier heights of joy 'twould soar— But now, it sinketh—ever sinketh still From depths to lower depths of grief and ill! MORNING! Morning!—Morning! how dost thou Now dart from Old Night's furrowed brow, Like that fair shape which fabled was In the olden days, (when fancy's glass Showed all things by its aid—descried, Raised, mystified, and magnified) To spring from Jove's all awful head— Where the clouding shadows dread Of curls ambrosial, veiled in gloom, The thunder-forming frown of doom! Morning!—Morning!—yet delay, Nor shine too soon to perfect day! Thou art so enchanting now— With thy pearl wreath round thy brow, With thy beauty-breathing face, All youthfulness and glowing grace, Thy dews, thy clouds, thy lovely looks, Mirrored in the woodland brooks; Thy gentle frowns, thy tears, thy smiles, Thine ever changing charming wiles— That we fain would have thee stay— Nor ask the approach of perfect day! Wild thou art, untamed and free— All thy Soul is ecstacy. Morning!—Morning!—could'st thou last, Half our sorrows sure were pass'd! Who can grieve in such an hour, Fancies bright, a dazzling shower, Seem to be twin-born with thee, Lightening o'er reality. Fancies glad and sweet and bright, Forgetting disappointment's blight, In thine hours of freshness start To the healed and heaving heart. Scattering, in profusion thick— Ever ceaselessly and quick— Like summer's hours, the glad and free, Their roses o'er reality— O'er harsh reality, whose reign Is of penance and of pain; Whose paths are all with thorns o'erspread, And withered leaves and blossoms dead; But these sweet fancies scatter free Their roses o'er reality, And make it seem a lovely thing, Lending it their hues of spring— Their buoyant airs—their changeful gleams, Till seems it fair as fleeting dreams! Yet lasting and substantial too— Certain, faithful, fixed, and true, As the heart desires should be Its well prized felicity. Morning, Morning, who can weep, When thy smiles are reddening deep. O'er the bower and o'er the stream, And Nature shineth like a dream! Born that instant from the brain, Ne'er to look so fair again! Morning, Morning—pause—Oh! stay, Pass not to the perfect day. Morning!—Morning!—part not yet, Cares the busy day beset; All our troubles and our woes Round us then too darkly close. Morning, Morning, pause and stay— What! already flown away? The sky a hue more settled wears— Less fresh and free the wandering airs Breathe against the heated brow— 'Tis the noontide's fulness now. Morning!—Morning!—thou art past Into perfect day at last! SOMETIMES THINK OF ME. Sometimes, Oh! sometimes think of me, And in thy heart for ever be Such memories, soft as snows that fall Upon some stream in icy thrall. As snows that in their silence fall On some fair stream in icy thrall— That melt not suddenly away, But there awhile all brightly stay. Then, when the warmer, lovelier beam Doth o'er the frozen surface gleam, They are lost at once in the blue light Of that freed stream—far rolling bright. So may these memories on thy heart— Oh! deeply cherished that thou art— Awhile remain all calm and pure, But not for ever to endure. When comes the happier, lovelier ray Upon that dreaming heart to play— Oh! not then, let them haunt that heart, But silently dissolve—depart! I would not, could not bear to be A sorrow or a care to thee— But think of me ev'n thus, I pray, And banish soon those thoughts away! Yes! think of me who walk in tears Through shadows of my lonely years— Who live alone in memory, And think and think of nought but Thee. SORROW'S CLOUD. Sorrow hath come upon me as a cloud, Beneath whose might my very life seems bow'd; And crushed to dust and gloomy nothingness, Are hopes that once perplexed with rich distress! For once I walked in paths so full of joy That gladness ev'n could pall and Hope could cloy— Hope, that such treasures and delights displayed— Perforce—my dazzled fancy sought the shade. I knew not where to turn—nor which to choose, These loved I much, yet liked not those to lose; That bright perplexity of Hope no more Shall ruffle and disturb my heart's pierced core. Sorrow hath crushed my life with her dull cloud, Beneath her rule my trembling Soul is bowed; Whate'er she proffers, that submiss we take, Though the o'er worn heart should with its suffrance break! VOICES FROM THE DEAD. Voices long loved—come back upon my dreams, And make my heart's blood flow in quicker streams— And faces and dear forms familiar, light My slumber till it grows almost too bright! The Dead are living there—upon their cheek, Burns Life's own loveliest and most radiant streak, Within the unsealed and the unshrouded eye— Bright kindlings play and loving meanings lie. They speak to me in their accustomed tone, And speak not of the distant World unknown— They smile on me—and I on them smile too— Nor shrink in awe, but long rent ties renew. Mighty Creatress—Soul! immortal thing— How dost thou mount upon thy tameless wing, When the outward World is hidden and removed, Compelling back to thee thy lost and loved. In thine own life they living seem to be— They move and breathe—and are—and act in thee; This Phantom World is by thy fair skill wrought, Thou that canst sweep wide space with one wing'd thought! Voices long loved—come back upon my dreams, My heart's-blood flows in warmer—quicker streams— They come—Oh! could they stay—content I were To yield my waking life for dreams so fair! ROSES. Roses! fairest loveliest Flowers! Oh! ye Queens of fervid hours— Glorious Daughters of the Sun, Who smiles more when your life's begun— Enchantresses that steep the air In your spells of sweetness rare— Bright Sultanas of the Summer! Banquets of each flying hummer! Roses! fairest loveliest Flowers! Oh! ye Queens of glorious hours— When your smile is on the air, Beauty and delight are there. Your fine odours can impart Gladness to the very heart— Treasures of the Sun's bright coining! Light and flame and perfume joining! Roses! fairest loveliest Flowers! Oh! ye Queens of fervid hours— Luxury from your leaves is shed— Beauty beameth from your head. The Eden of our Nature's prime Blessed your earliest blossom time; Another, surely, then, shall hail ye, When Earth a blighted wreck shall fail ye! THE EMIGRANTS. They went unto the Strangers' Land— A thoughtful, but aspiring band; They left their own old homes afar, And trusted to a tempting Star, That bade them cross the rolling main, Ne'er, ne'er to view those homes again. They went into the Strangers' Land— A thoughtful, but aspiring band, That their young children might be blest With stores of plenty, and with rest; And that their children's children too Might thankful, for long years, renew Their hymns of praise and fervent prayers— Not ground to Earth with haggard cares. They went unto the Strangers' Land— A thoughtful, and a trustful band, And yet when first they went—and yet Their brows were wan—their eyes were wet; They left their village homesteads dear With many a groan and many a tear; Although those village homesteads then— Those calm retreats in wood and glen, Were darkened o'er by gloomy shade Of poverty—upon them laid! In quiet golden Sabbath eves, When soft winds kissed the fluttered leaves, And rosy clouds, like conscious things, Sailed soft and slow on their flushed wings, And tender dews to Earth fell soft, Blessings of fertile wealth to waft. How oft with their dear children near— Too young to share the grief—the fear— Their green old Sabbath tree, beheld These sitting round, with spirit quelled, And heart that struggled with its lot, And poisoned that once happy spot! And so they sought the Strangers' Land— A sorrowing, yet a trustful band; Sorrowing, indeed, to leave behind The Scenes that first impressed the Mind With feelings sacred, deep, and pure, E'en such as long and last endure! Scenes where first they raptured saw, With kindling faith and reverent awe, In Nature—Nature's God revealed, Who formed the lilies of the field, The light of the opening firmament, And Man—to whom all, all was lent; But hopeful, and with zeal inspired— Upholden by a strength untired, Through blessed Religion's solemn aid— That still forbade to be afraid— They sought the Strangers' distant Land— A thoughtful, and a trustful band; They knew, (though features strange it wear!—) They still should find their Father there! THE DELIGHTS OF THE DREAMER. How the outward World is lost to us— To the Worlds of dreaming borne, Even while the midnight round us frowns, Lo! we hail the Light of Morn! Magnificently strange, in sooth! Oh! how magnificently strange! The wonders and the glories are Of this mighty nightly change! The beauteous grows more beautiful, And the cherished one more dear, Beheld not through the medium dark, Of pain or doubt or fear. Unearthly Powers are all our own, And boundless is our sway; We rule, and utter forth command, And a thousand worlds obey! We take the Wings of Morning then, And nothing seems concealed From our keen, far-piercing sight and thought, But all at once revealed. We govern like the Fates of Fate, And proudly make that still, Outshaping our course and its own, Subservient to our will! The distant then is close at hand, The past Hours live again; The Dead arise—the Sun stands still— O'er Time and Fate we reign! We wake! Where wait our legioned Powers To execute our will? In dreaming, we, as Gods might seem, O'er mastering, ruling still! In dreaming, the great Soul creates, Commands, controuls, and forms:— We reign—throned Lords of Life and Light; We wake—and we are Worms! THE SOUND OF BEES. Music is on the air! Delightful sounds Of birds and humming-bees! From Winter's bounds The earth hath burst, and claps her hands with glee, And hangs triumphal banners on each tree, And shouts amain her songs of victory proud, And flings back from her form the pallid shroud, And lights her brow with garlands of bright flowers, And welcomes wildly back the Spring's sweet hours. I dwell in silence and in solitude, Alternate joy and sadness stamp my mood; Now thoughts of pleasure lead to thoughts of pain, And these melt suddenly to joy again! The bees sing by me in the golden air; They leave no trace, no print, no memory there; But, Oh! a thousand on my heart! for fast That sound brings rushing visions of the past! That long shall dwell there in their wond'rous might, And leave behind a loveliness and light. How doth a train of starry sympathies Within my Soul uncalled, uncourted rise! I dream myself at once full far away A thousand leagues—(for swift as lightning's ray, And swifter yet is thought)—between me lie And this fair Land of loveliest witchery, A lovelier in my sight to me is shown, A lovelier and a dearer far—mine own. A thousand sympathies and memories rise, I dream myself beneath my native skies, My own sweet native skies, too far away, And feel the quiet of its summer's day Gladdening my feelings where no burning glare Consumes as in this sultry, blinding air; But all is golden beauty, golden rest, And soft tranquillity in young smiles dress'd, And balmy freshness and delight serene, Which springs for ever from the enchanted scene. Those bees, those murmuring bees, their sounding wings Transporteth me at once from alien things To things familiar, precious things and dear— Oh! sweet is that slight murmur to mine ear! That tender soft alarum, faint and low; How well its slumberous melody I know! That drowsy, dreaming tocsin of delight— It hath a wondrous and a magic might! A thousand thousand times in the olden days, Lost in immingling thoughts' bewildered maze! Have I sat listening to that lulling sound, Breathing the rapture of a peace profound; Oh! murmur on—and let my thoughts still stray To those loved days—that loved Land far away. E'en like yourselves they stray from flower to flower— With cunning skill and with mysterious power, Gathering the juices 'midst their leaves enshrined— Hiving the heav'n-sweet honey in the mind. Oh! deeply deeply—exquisitely dear Is that soft Summer-murmur to mine ear. THOU NEED'ST NOT TELL. Thou need'st not tell me to remember, no! I could not if I would forget, while still The currents of my Soul unchanging flow— As they before have flow'd through good and ill. First I must cease to love ere I forget, And consciousness must cease ere love depart, And thou too, thou wilt well remember yet— For surely feeling heart hath pow'r on heart. Thou need'st not tell me to remember, no! Memory and love must last, while life shall last; Fear not a moment's wandering here below, Believe me, I but breathe—but feel the past. I go—and with me Faith and feeling go— With me thou art morn's first thought and midnight's last; To me all other bliss were worse than woe— Believe me, I but breathe—but bless the past. Thou need'st not tell me to remember, no! I could not if I would forget thee now— The currents of my Soul unchanging flow— And still my heart doth one deep sway avow! THE FAIR SPOT. It is a sweet and gentle spot, For thought and feeling made, A quiet and a dreamy spot— Half sunshine and half shade. Here the shadow of proud chestnut trees Spreads massy, broad, and dark, And at shut of flowers forth glances fair The glow-worm's emerald spark. There the violet tufts are clustered thick, And shed a blue light round— What time the young and roseate spring— Flings garlands on the ground. It is a sweet and lovely spot For thought and feeling made; Yet there in thoughtless carelessness My childish footsteps strayed. I felt not its deep influence then— Nor felt its softening power— I played therewith a bounding heart, Through many a smiling hour. What stern dark lessons hath my heart Since then been deeply taught; Too mournfully it now is filled With feeling and with thought! This fair fair spot now brings at once Fond fancies to my mind; Nor here alone sad influences, My heart is skilled to find. E'en in the gladdest, gayest scenes, Of something 'tis aware, That breathes of human suffering, Of human grief and care. The Banquet and the Festival Have shadows round them thrown; These shadows, Heart, so joyous once, Alas! they're all thine own. The sunniest spots on Nature's face Are darkened by a veil; And, Oh! that veil is all of tears, That tells of Life's dark tale! I MOVE THROUGH MANY SHADOWS. I move through many shadows evermore, That darkened out my mortal paths of yore; How fain would I forget the joys now lost, Thus shipwrecked on a blank and barren coast! Still this reluctant heart will recollect! Poor foundered bark, so ruined and so wrecked! And 'tis this memory that for ever lends The keenest sting whose pang my bosom rends! Oh! Love and Happiness! ye heavenly things! That brought a world of treasure on your wings, How can the hapless wretch who once hath known Your joys supreme, live on when these are flown? Love, Love! and Happiness! Ye made this Earth Too fair for me t' endure its blighted dearth; My Soul refuseth to receive the draught Of bitter anguish which must yet be quaffed! That Soul forgets ye not; still vainly pines, And with an agony convulsive twines Around the empty shadows, that but mock Her efforts wild, and smite with keenest shock! The incessant effort and the failure still, 'Tis these that fill the measure of our ill, The longing and the memory deep and vain, The fond resistance—these exalt the pain! My thoughts still cling to those dear perished joys, And kiss the poisoned weapon that destroys; In vain I strive to hope, wish, seek, expect, Still this reluctant heart will recollect! I move, 'mid ceaseless shadows ever now, Reflected back from mine own heart and brow, Shadows that follow me where'er I stray, Shadows that make a midnight of the day. Will time bring resignation or relief Unto this deadly bitterness of grief? Will time soothe down the tempest of the mind, And bid the outwearied wretch some solace find? Oh! bitter this regret, this unsooth'd care, This bitterness, than barren blankness were, Better to draw Pain's agitated breath, Than slow to anticipate mine own sure death! AND ARE WE STRANGERS? And are we strangers now We that have loved so long? Must I forget Love's vow That trembled from thy tongue? And must we severed dwell, In loneliness and gloom, We that have loved so well, Each in a separate tomb? For, Oh! this Earth so fair, Shall seem to us to be, In our long and dark despair— One grave—for thee and me. I cannot say farewell, I will not speak that word; But in my Soul doth dwell That thought—a lightning-sword! We must be strangers now, We that have loved so long— Farewell Love's gentle vow And sigh more sweet than song. We must now severed dwell In solitude and gloom; We that have loved so well, Each in a separate Tomb! OH! OFTTIMES IN THE FESTAL HALL. Oh! ofttimes in the Festal Hall, Oft at the blazing Festival, When music, dancing, flowers, and light Make a magic hour and bright, Thoughts that spring from darkest mood On my startled mind intrude, Not such thought of frowning gloom E'en should spring from neighbouring Tomb. There 'mid all the pomp and blaze, Ghastly visions pain my gaze; From the youthful cloudless brow, Perfect in its polished snow, Fancy strips the glowing wreath, And pales it to the hues of death; Steals the glad smile from the lips, And darkens them with Death's eclipse! So at the joyous Festival, In the loud harp-resounding Hall, Thus thus do funeral thoughts intrude On my mind's capricious mood, And sun-blazed stones, flowered broideries fair' Glittering—gleaming proudly there, Fancy turns to shrouds and worms, Making foul the fairest forms! Fancy only playeth here The part of prophet and of seer, For soon, full soon these forms so bright, Richly decked on festal night— Shall be laid within the mould, Grim and ghastly, stark and cold; Fancy only playeth here The mournful part of sage and seer! Soon the front of stainless snow, The stainless smiling sunny brow, Shall forget its witching grace— Death shall every charm efface; Soon the fair cheek's rosy hues, Death's dark paleness shall suffuse, Every smile shall pass away, Nor the trace of one shall stay! I look upon the joyous throngs, While speed the dances and the songs, And dream, unchecked by faultering fears, Of the sure-oncoming years— These revellers soon must soundly rest, Where the host soothes not the guest, Where the icy feast is spread, The feast of Death and of the Dead! Smiles not Old Time upon his way, To see these dreamers sport and play? Thousands hath he seen do thus, Like little dew drops tremulous, Sparkling on a leaf awhile, In the glowing sunbeams' smile; Then swept off for evermore, Their Brightness and their Being o'er! STANZAS. [It is joy, it is rapture to dwell near to thee] It is joy, it is rapture to dwell near to thee; Must these hours like the rapid-winged summer birds flee? Must these hours like the flowers of the summer-shine fade? Must silence o'ercome them, and sorrow, and shade? It is joy, it is rapture near thee, love, to dwell, And that joy by my soul is prized deeply and well; Must these hours of enchantment, these hours of delight, Ever vanish and sink beneath Fate's ruthless blight? Oh! awhile Life's rich wealth of deliciousness seems Concentered, contained in these hours and their dreams; Every thought that up springs in my mind seems to be In itself a deep happiness, soaring and free. I look round, and this world seems a world all of bliss, For the heart's joy can brighten e'en worlds dark as this; And yet something is whispering still to that heart, This is joy—this is triumph—yet glad hours depart! Oh! how soon might my fabric of bliss melt away, Since wert thou, Love, to leave me what hope then would stay? And these hours so enchanting and bright to my Soul, Towards the darkness of ruin should stormily roll. I SEE THEE NOT. I see thee not, I hear thee not, Oh! sad and heavy is the lot Of one, who hoards up treasured pain! And weeps and hopeless weeps in vain! Of one who sacred holds her grief, And dreams not, thinks not of relief, Till sorrow grows of life a part, The habitual feeling of the heart. But not the less is't sorrow still!— Not less the tortured pulses thrill; The heart is all as wrung and sore, The pain is poignant as before! The vulture never groweth tame, The fearful suffering is the same, Nay day by day, and hour by hour, Seems gathering yet intenser power! I see thee not, I hear thee not, Grief, grief indulged ne'er soothes my lot, My tears and tortures all are vain, Pain cannot reconcile to pain! ON THE BROAD BLAZONED ROLLS. On the broad blazoned rolls of Fame, 'Twere joy, proud joy, to stamp my name; But, Ah! 'tis stamped not on thy heart, Then thus I pine for humbler part! Oh! Ladye! if no echo there May my glad triumph's pride declare, Away with glory and renown, Let me and Sorrow die unknown! Let not the trumpet-tongue of Fame My vain atchievements then proclaim; Unknown, unmarked would I depart, If banished from thy gentle heart! If no niche, in that temple fair May be my portion and my share, The only refuge-place I crave Is, Ladye, in the lonely grave! Then haply when thou hear'st my fate, Repenting, but, Alas! too late, Thou'lt, softened, give one gentle sigh To glorify my memory! And that most costly sigh were worth All other triumphs of the Earth; All treasures and all triumphs here, But 'twill not waken Death's dull ear! Then in thy thoughts thou'lt celebrate That One who loved thee long and late— Blot from the blazoned rolls my name, Thy memory far outstrips all Fame! But that exceeding glory, yet, When my veiled star of Life is set, Shall never pierce the pall of gloom That wraps the tenant of the tomb! Then, Ladye, while I live accord A look, a sigh, a smile, a word— Trophies, that make Pride's pageants seem The shadows of a dubious dream. And if on blazoned rolls of Fame, Success may stamp my honoured name— Shrined in thy pure heart's temple fair, Grant me a niche more glorious there! SWEET FLOWERS. Ye roses deep burning ye violets of blue, Ye fair sculptured lilies of soft silvery hue, All ye children of Sunshine, and daughters of Day, That with beauty and bloom gild and brighten our way, Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Sweet Flowers!—for could Youth and could Love do without ye? All ye children of Summer, and daughters of Day, Ye that brighten our world, and that lighten our way, How ye spread your rich charm round the green banks and bowers, How ye wreathe the flushed wings of the golden-clad hours. Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Sweet Flowers!—for could Youth and could Love do without ye? Deep hyacinths—coloured like noon's sapphire skies, Sweet Jessamines, fair as night's clear scattered eyes— Oh! primroses pale as love grows with delight, When the adored one, in beauty's fair pride comes in sight— Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Flowers! Flowers!—how could Love, how could Youth do without ye? Faint anemones—shedding the tenderest of gleams— As ye loved the Sun's rays less than Moonlight's soft beams, Bright jonquilles—still filling the delicate air With a fragrance refined, floating dreamily there— Be Blessings about ye!—be blessings about ye, Flowers! Flowers!—how could Love, how could Youth do without ye? Ever—children of sunshine and daughters of day, Shed delight round our dwellings, and smiles round our way, And clasp us in chains of that gentle delight— 'Mid Earth's joys 'tis the purest—it should not take flight— Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Sweet Flowers!—for could Love, and could Youth do without ye? Round the bride's blushing forehead, flowers! flowers! ever twine, Not fairer were wreaths of Heaven's crowned stars divine; And, Oh! lend too a life-like and tremulous bloom To the slumberer whose pillow is spread in the tomb— Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Sweet Flowers!—for could Feeling or Love do without ye? At the festival, smile with your fairest of smiles, Nature's breath grows more dear amid arts' laboured wiles, And the garland that hangs by the proud mirror'd wall, Seems worth the vain show, and the gaudy pomps all— Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Flowers! Flowers!—how could Love, how could Joy do without ye? Ye richly enhance and serenely adorn The beauty and triumph of fair-beaming Morn— And the glory of Noon, and the soft grace of Eve— From ye—a fresh charm they for ever receive— Be Blessings about ye!—be blessings about ye, Sweet Flowers!—how could Love or could Youth do without ye? Ye soothe us in sorrow—ye bless us in joy, And the pleasure ye bring us may know not to cloy; Oh! children of Sunlight, bright daughters of day, 'Tis the breath of lost Eden ye fling round our way— Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Sweet Flowers!—for could Love or could Youth do without ye? Bright children of Sunshine!—fair daughters of day, Gild the golden-flushed hours!—and redouble the ray! Ye are Nature's own poetry—lo, how ye start— Gushing, glowing, and bright from her full fervent heart— Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Flowers!—Flowers!—for could Youth, Love, or Hope do without ye? Ye are Nature's own poetry!—nothing breathes there Of the work-day World's trouble—the every day's care— Are ye idle and useless?—Oh! weak impious thought, The same hand formed your stems, that Creation's frame wrought— Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Flowers!—Flowers!—for could Youth or Youth's Love do without ye? Blest children of Sunshine!—bright daughters of day, Ye gladden our triumphs, and gild our decay— The festival craves ye from sweet sheltered spot, And dark grows the funeral where ye're scattered not— Be Blessings about ye!—be Blessings about ye, Flowers!—Flowers!—for could Love, Hope, or Grief do without ye? ONCE I WAS BLESSED. Once was I blessed with Fancy and with Hope, Through paths of joy how lightly did I move; But now in sorrow and in fear I droop, My Star set in the Sunrise of my love. Even in the Sunrise of my love, alas! My Star of Destiny did dimly set; All but that all absorbing love doth pass From my wrung soul—that now must peace forget! Oh! 'twas a stormy sunrise and a stern, The Firmament of Life seemed set on fire!— How do the o'erpowering rays, consuming burn, Till Hope's fresh dews, and Joy's wreath'd flowers expire! My star Set in the Sunrise of my love!— Which casts a deadly and a fatal light, So that I trembling and bewildered move, Dazzled into the darkness of the night! AND THOU CANST FAITHLESS. And thou canst faithless, heartless, loveless prove, Who taught this heart—and learned in teaching—Love! Then let me hide and veil my blushing brow— I am ashamed of Love and loving now. I am ashamed of Love that can become, Beneath these petty changes of our doom, A thing so weak, so worthless, and so vain— I loathe his empire, and I scorn his chain! Oh! yet bethink thee of the dear days past— Condemn me not to Sorrow's pangs at last— We trod a path too beautiful, too bright, To lead to shades of stern and starless night! I am ashamed of Love that thus can lose The glorious light of Constancy's fair hues, Whose soul of truth—whose crown of faith is gone— I am ashamed of Love!—and yet love on! But my Love is as different still from thine As earth's dim lamps from stars that deathless shine; It needeth not to be still watched and fed— A feeble light and faintly-flickering shed. It is a world apart of living light— It feels no failure—and it fears no blight; It feeds upon itself for evermore, And still with light and flame streams running oer. AWAY UNTO THE WOODLAND SCENES! Away unto the Woodland Scenes, Where a boundless freedom reigns; Away from worldly din and gloom, And captivity and chains. For they who in the world abide Shall be evermore enslaved, And bitter is the lot of him Who e'er that world hath braved! The finger there is on the lip, And the fetter on the hand, We look and speak, and act and think, But like the encircling band! Our thoughts are their thoughts ever still, And our words are echoes true— 'Twere madness or to feel or act But as the others do. Away, then, from the worldly din, From the shadow and the strife— Snatch fair gifts from the hand of Fate— And taste the cup of Life! Away unto the Woodland Scenes, Where joy in freedom reigns! How can you rove the crushing crowd— Captivity and chains? How can ye bear to give away Heaven's noblest gift august, And fling Man's freewill at Man's feet, Where trampled 'tis to dust! No!—vindicate thy right—thy self— Give the Great Soul its sway; 'Tis sad to see it wronged, debased, And withering day by day! 'Tis sad to see it fastened down At Custom's footstool vile, Cramped with a thousand petty chains, That stain it and defile. Away to Nature's lofty scenes, To the Mountain and the Wood— That liberated Prisoner shall Pronounce them fair and good. Away to Nature's holy haunts, Where Truth with Freedom reigns— Farewell! dull scenes of worldly gloom, Captivity and chains! Away to where the river gleams, The shadows dance and play— The flowers bloom fair—the leaves glance green— To Nature's scenes away! I pant to breathe the fresh, fresh air, 'Twill give my Soul new life; I pine to 'scape the din, the gloom, The struggle, and the strife. Take me—Oh! take me, Nature, now, And lay me on thy heart! Great Mother of my Soul, to thee I fly from sting and smart. No longer can I bear to wear The hateful shroud and mask, No longer can I bear to spell The dull trite common task. Sweet Mother of my Soul, I come Beneath thy smile to dwell— Pillow me on thy blessed lap, For, Oh! I love thee well. I love thee well—I love thee more Than words can ever show— Oh! save me, shield me from the strife, The anguish and the woe. Not in the crowds would I remain, Unfit am I to bear The dull captivity and chains Which there all hearts must share. I cannot stoop to give away Heaven's loftiest gift sublime— And yield the Freewill of my Soul, 'Twere madness—worse!—'twere crime!— Away to Nature's haunts afar, From turmoil and from wrath, There shall I breathe the freshest air, There tread the fairest path! Away unto the woodland scenes, Prepare, sweet birds, prepare To welcome back a Soul set free, With Mirth and Music there. Strew, strew my way, ye lovely flowers, Strew my Triumphal Way! I pant, I pine through freedom's paths Once more in joy to stray! Free as the dance of light leaves there, My thoughts in joy shall be, And what are thoughts that like the wind Are not unchained and free? Away with doubt, and with its chill— With slavery and its fear! My heart hath, like a prisoned bird, Lost its sweet song-notes here! Distraction's turmoil evermore Accompanies my way; Oh! to roam free as eagles are, Throughout the live-long day! Away unto the woodland scenes— To flowers, birds, leaves, and light! For all of Nature's beauty now Is blessed in my sight! How can man e'er consent to lose In crowds her fair gifts all? To waste their lives—to waste their thoughts— Themselves—their souls in thrall? Still day by day we thus become More wretched and more mean, Till ofttimes all unfit to roam In Nature's purer scene! Her voice should startle and dismay, And her aspect shock the Soul— While art and dull monotony Possess—and crush the whole! Not like the Prodigal's return Shall be the worldling's then; Our own faults we may well repent, Not those of other men. And e'en—very faults are learned— Copied with closest care, Until we fancy these indeed Are virtues pure and fair. Perverted judgments—thoughts—perplexed— Confusing wrong and right— These are the deadliest ills and banes Which can our spirits blight! We cannot then retrack our way, We know not to repent— We press on in the self same path, In dark entanglement. We cannot feel remorse for things We deem are just and right; And all the time our very Souls Are ruined by the blight. Our feelings cold and loveless grow, Hardened our deepest hearts, Our words are wiles—our looks are masks, Our very thoughts are arts! Ushered to Nature's presence then, A faint and vague dismay Should seize on our unconscious minds, That far have gone astray. Unconscious still, and yet aware Of something that but ill Accordeth with that presence pure, And high and glorious still. Something that doth not in her peace, Nor her purity rejoice— That trembleth and that shrinketh back From her commanding voice! But to her lofty presence yet With rapture I repair; Oh! bless'd assurance to my Soul That the poison is not there! To her high places I repair, And to her presence pure; And hath that Soul escaped the brand, The infection—and the lure? Oh! joy! true joy! I yet shall move Where boundless freedom reigns; I yet shall move in gladness, freed From captivity and chains. I bring back to the woodland haunts A wounded wearied heart; But one unstained and undebased By slavery and by art I bring back to the Sylvan scenes A wrung and wasted mind; Yet full of feelings that ere long Their wonted strength shall find. I bring back Hope, Faith, Zeal, and Love, And of my Soul I bring The unconquered and the uncrushed Free Will— A high Heaven-honoured thing! SUNSET AT MOLA DE GAETA. The Sea, the Sky, the Air, the Mountains, grow Each moment still more glorious; Earth below, And Heaven above, deep dyes triumphal wear, Intense and burning in their brightness rare! That dazzles in the Soul—the o'erwhelming blaze, Fools the strained sense, and gathers on the gaze In full and fast increase, until the eye Feels 'wildered in the maze of radiancy, And knows not where to fix nor where to turn, Nor half the light of glory can discern, Nor to the depths of Beauty pierce, through all The kindling splendours of that dazzling pall! I dream—I surely dream!—it cannot be Such pompous vision is reality!— Is this the Earth where oft dull shadows spread? And breadths of frowning gloom profound and dread! 'Tis paved as 'twere with glass and beaten gold, A miracle and mystery to behold! Is this the air where floating vapours rise, And veil the orient triumph of the skies? Though in this Land of Loveliness, not oft May these upon their wings a darkness waft, As in less favoured climes where shines the Sun With feebler ray Creation's scenes upon. How doth it kindle with transparent glow, As 'twere indeed a Heaven around us now! Almost we think to see the flashing wings, The out-blazing crowns, the harps of golden strings, The dwellers of the fair celestial sphere, Amidst the glory at its height appear! The Sea, the Sky, the Air, the Mountains, grow Each moment still more glorious—matchless show!— Each instant tints more beauteous they assume, Like spreading flowers, still heightening to their bloom; Their ripe full-blown perfection's glowing grace, While not one streak we there unfinished trace. Consummate Honr!—the waves far-glittering flow In fire and dazzling light!—The proud Heavens glow As though their highest heights were now unveiled; The mountains gleam as their bright tops were scaled By thousand torch-bearers at once! So strong The light that lives their crimsoned crests along, Startling and overpowering to the sense, In colour and in brilliancy intense! Consummate hour!—consummate scene!—be shrined Through Memory's art, for ever in my mind— For Nature, surely doth not proudly wear A vesture and a mien so Heavenly fair But for the passing moment on its flight— No—'tis to waken thoughts, whose lofty might Should long endure when that rich glow is gone, And it survives but in those thoughts alone! For this she wears her exquisite array, And glories in a bright unmatched display; For this she greets us, in unwonted state, And shines in loveliness and pride, elate. The Sea—the Sky—the Air—the Mountains, grow Each moment more sublime, above—below, The glory spreads, and all is wrapp'd and wound In one deep beauty, that hath not a bound; And who shall say where spreads the mightiest charm On Earth's lit face, or where Heaven's splendours swarm? Below—or in the bright triumphal Sky— Yet there the Enchanter reigns enthroned on high. There reigns the Great Magician of the hour— In all the proudest fullness of his power; Ere yet his daily course is fully run, The setting, sinking, slow descending Sun! From whose resplendent throne of burning light, Those splendours all, stream down upon the sight! Till beauteous grows the Universal Scene, As 'twere suffused with an Immortal Sheen! The Sea—the Sky—the Air—the Mountains—say, To these do we the eye's rapt homage pay? Nor to that Sun who lends them every charm, Turn with an admiration yet more warm! Oh! for that sinking and descending Sun— 'Tis beautiful—but 'tis unchanged and One!— And in his own Reflection's sumptuous pride, Spread broad afar, beneath, around, beside, Appears—while glows the Scene, by shades uncross'd, Victoriously—magnificently lost!— Though paramount, and absolute he be, And all pre-eminent in Majesty. A glorious and unrivalled Potentate, Girt with the splendours of a princely State— Still for that sinking, that descending Sun— 'Tis beautiful, but 'tis unchanged and One! The wonders he hath wrought himself surpass, More beautious is he in his varying glass, Than is his Mighty Self—all shapes—all hues, (While round him fast fresh glories still he strews,) His rich Reflection exquisitely takes, And on the sense a World of wonders breaks!— Each golden-gleaming smile—each wandering ray, In thousand bright unfoldings glittering play— He hath no Rival, save himself—behold His Shadow, all of crimson light and gold, In these fine shiftings can compete alone, With that Great Monarch on his blazing Throne. His own Imperial Image every where, Thus stamped Majestic and Sublimely fair— Can only thus dispute his claim and right, And win from him with deep and magic might. The enraptured homage of the adoring eye, And bid it pass the Sovereign Splendour by, His images!—his shadows!—for 'tis not Fixed in one shape, or fettered to one spot; That deep eflection—and 'tis that which charms The 'wildered eye, while throng in glittering swarms These countless kindling lustres brightening round, Without cessation and without a bound. He hath no Rival save himself—behold How proudly that Reflection doth unfold, In every shape, and shown on every side, In multiplied and heightened radiance wide! In that he shines most glorious and supreme, While Seas of golden sunshine round him stream; In that he takes all semblances and shapes, And in the rolling cloud afar escapes— Rolling in gold and glory—spreading wide Its gleaming wings of fair and fulgent pride— And in those waves far-dazzling rippling flows, Varying from gilded sheen to blushful rose. Yet steadfast still in lustre, strong and clear, That makes the waves, like gems dissolved, appear!— And towers effulgent, o'er the effulgent shores, In each fair mount that crimson-crested soars, Like thrones to pillar strong, that proudest throne, To which he thus aspireth back—his own! And on those shores smiles beautiful and bright, In burning bloom, and keen vermillion light. And still that rich Reflection's boundless blaze, Wins, fixes, fascinates the admiring gaze!— And tempts us with its witchery to forget That soon of sunset born, it too must set, And with its gleams and tints, and glows and smiles, The sense confused—yet raptured it beguiles From the great, glorious, mighty Source of all, That triumphs in his high monarchic hall— And flings the banners of that triumph wide, With all their blazoned pomp from side to side— And bids the pageants of his pride unroll, Till blaze to suns the thoughts of th' inmost Soul! And casts, as 'twere, his crown from off his brow, To jewel Earth and Air thus richly now, And is himself, in this his finest hour, While sinking bright in that fair western bower Of regal glory, and Augustan pride, (Where still in king-like state doth he abide) 'Midst his own splendours, by no shadow cross'd, Imperially—magnificently, lost! SEA! LOVELY SEA! Sea! lovely Sea! so still, so blue, so bright, Spread, like an Element of precious light, In endless beauty now before our eyes! Say, hast thou treasured up from these blue skies, All hues of glory from the first rich burst Of splendour, that e'er flushed them—from the first E'en to the last of wond'rous loveliness, With which thus royally thyself to dress? Most beautiful thou art—nor thou alone, All round thee girdled with Perfection's zone, Triumphs in light and bloom while beauty bends, E'en beauty that all dream, all thought transcends Above the chrystal of thy mirror-wave, Where gloom dares not to brood, nor storms to rave; As though astonished at herself, so fair, So strangely lovely doth she kindle there. How clear that tracery shines—the forms, the hues There mirrored so enchant us, that we lose The proud reality, itself so bright, In its sweet Image, that seems made of light. Sea! glorious Sea! to thee 'tis surely given, To lend new loveliness to Earth and Heaven, These hills of beauty see themselves more fair, Like golden mounts of glowing brightness there. These skies, these matchless skies, more perfect seem, Chained in the rapture of thy purple dream! Is it that Heaven more heavenly seemeth, thus Enshrined as 'twere in our own Earth—to us! Ah! heavenliest still when thus immixed with thee, Beloved, and beautiful, and blessed Sea! That glorious Ocean! which triumphant rolls! That mighty Sea!—'Tis like to our own Souls! Wherefore we love it with a yearning love, More than the Earth beneath, or skies above! Sea! thou art like to our own living Souls— (With whose unrest thy fine unrest condoles)— These, too, thus brightly mirror back supreme, Even heightened in their full majestic dream— The mightiest pomps of Nature far and free, Can thus the glass of all her glories be! The Worlds—the rolling Worlds that shine at night, Thereon are traced in all their blissful light, And on that ample surface find they space, To wear their splendours all—and run their race!— As Sea, great Sea, upon thy surface fair, Yet still they are but Stars of Beauty there— They are but points of quivering radiancy Thus mirrored back, blue Ocean, upon thee; But in that Soul reflected, deep and clear, How do they there outblazing, Sphere by Sphere, Start into Suns and Worlds, undulled, undimmed, With all the mystery of their Beauty brimmed, With all their triumph on their beaming Heads, Which far into the Soul each Glory sheds, Not only on its surface spreading light, But through its solemn depths with kindling might, Far through its solemn, silent depths serene, Where opens then a dread and wond'rous scene, Which th' Angels who Creation's coming saw, Might look upon with interest and with awe! Not there, not there the Stars shine forth and gleam Bright points of light; but deeply dazzling beam Those Worlds, as Worlds, majestic, nor remain Like fair lamps quivering, hung in viewless chain!— No! through that Soul their proudest march is made, In fulness of their awful pomp arrayed; In all their dread unutterable pride, With thrones, powers, principalities allied, Telling of Him who made them evermore, And still unfolding the divinest lore! Through the deep Soul their proudest march is made, In fulness of their startling pomp arrayed, For there they seem to speak of Him alone Whose shadow sits on them as on a throne, And makes their brightness!—bidding them to shine With matchless lustres and with light divine! There, there to speak of Him alone they seem— And with His Glory's living rays to beam, There more immediately they seem to rise From Him who breathed upon the spac?d skies; And saw them swarm with Suns, that rolling blazed, And with Perfection's truth their Maker praised. Yes! more immediately they seem to spring, Shrined in that Soul—a dread and deathless thing! From His almighty and august command, From the unknown working of his forming hand, Than in these firmaments, where their pure flame For centuried cycles still hath flashed the same; And but of Him there speak—perchance like ours, Those worlds so fair, with their empyreal dowers, Have strange and mighty changes undergone, Since first in their high place they proudly shone. Perchance estranged from what they were they are, And less of His Almighty favour share— But we may only know them, only see, As the offspring pure of Parent Deity; They stream upon our souls with glory given, From glory's fountain head, in highest Heaven. They tell not of themselves to us—of thee They tell—Oh! thou who spoke and bade them be. Thus through our Souls their proudest march is made, In shadow of the living Light arrayed! There, truly as the Sons of God they shine, In mystic brightness, dazzling and divine! Each as of heavenly light the heavenly heir, Are they triumphantly reflected there; Our Souls are their supreme, sublimer Space— 'Tis there they run their most majestic race— 'Tis there—Creator of all worlds!—they seem Full of Thy presence and Thy power to beam!— 'Tis these may shine most glorious and august— Shrines of our hopes, and towers of our high trust; Landmarks and lights of great Eternity We look on them—and look through them on Thee. SONNET. [A few sparse fleeting clouds are seen above] A few sparse fleeting clouds are seen above, And do but make the bright scene lovelier still With their fair shapes, that seem produced by skill, And labour, as some Handicraftsman strove, To make them perfect more and more!—e'en prove Their Beauty by a long, long gaze at will!— So shall you see them change—but as a rill That winds, but grows not shallower—as a dove Whose feathers shift their hues, but finely so, Become more beautiful and strangely bright— Their forms do through a thousand changes go, To wear fresh charms, seeming to us aright, As though the invisible Handicraftsman slow, With changeful mind wrought still,—studying perfection's Height! SONNET. [Amidst the darkness of green woods it stood] Amidst the darkness of green woods it stood, A ruin hoar, while many an antique mound Near it, proclaimed (for flowers there still were found) That gardens there had flourished, now i' the wood It looked a dreary thing!—the solitude Seem'd burthened by its presence—greenly round Those walls the o'ermantling ivy's wild wreathes wound Caressingly, while all the place seemed strewed With ancient memories—high chivalrous dreams Weighed on the blue transparent air—that shone Serenely there—heroic oldest themes Leapt to the thought and fancies of the gone And buried years, till all the kindling beams Of morning seemed to smile, around the past alone! FAIR FAIRY DAYS. Fair fairy days of childhood glad! I think of ye ev'n now, While cares and troubles dark and deep, Are glooming on my brow. Strange contrast that can scarce be borne!— Could this sick sorrowing heart Be once as light and free as air, Untouched by Grief's keen dart? Yes, once 'twas light as air and free, Oh! mighty wondrous change! The mystery of thy change—Oh! Death! Can scarcely seem more strange! The rose leaf or the raindrop then, Or flushed or freshened still, Each flying moment free from care, And never wronged by ill. Now deadly blight—or breathless gloom, The shadow or the storm, Alone I know—that crush this heart, And waste this fading form. Yet, Days of childhood! would I prove Your raptures o'er again?— No! not if I must learn to endure The sharp reverse of pain. No sense of Pleasure ere can match The intenseness of Pain's throe— On Earth reigns one unrivalled power, And 'tis the Power of Woe! Days of my childhood! ye were fair As spring and morning are, Why must such heralds sweet and bright Announce the approach of care? Clouds should forewarn us of the storm, And shadows of the night— Should these be but preceded by All beauteous things and bright?— Days of my childhood! ye are fled, Your memory still remains To embitter Grief's empoisoned draught, To increase all pangs and pains! For, Oh! such memories soften still The heart that should be strong, To brunt with desperate dauntlessness All shapes of wrath and wrong. Be strong as thy despair, my Heart!— And rugged as thy fate! Be thou unwearied as the Grief That still pursues with hate! Be rugged as thy stormy fate!— And strong as thy despair— Unwearied as thy woe—for, Oh! Much yet remains to bear. The lingering, pining, sick regret, (Worse than the fiery strife!) That numbs the energies and powers, And makes a Death of Life! That cramps at length the very thoughts, Warped from their free proud way— Bound to one Shadowy Subject still!— (And crusted with Life's clay!) That colours all our dreams with gloom, As twilight's leaden grey, O'er comes with one dim sombre hue, The tints of Earth's array. This have I yet to bear I feel, For hitherto my Heart Hath known alone the desperate strife— The poignant pang and smart. Stern stages of dark Sorrow still It yet hath to go through, For well it knows through life her power Shall long and late pursue. Too utterly hath it bowed down Before her fearful sway; And lent her all its fiery strength, On its own self to prey! A giant's strength untamed and fierce, To Sorrow hath it lent; Ne'er had she such deep powers before, To work her dire intent. A fearful host her steps attends, Born of its burning core!— So dread and terrible a host Ne'er worked her will before! The whirlwind-passions yet unchecked, (Which swayed it from its birth!—) Lend all their desperate energy To her—who rules the Earth. The passion-whirlwind-blasts rage wild— Destruction stern they spread, And leagued with anguish crush the heart, With sufferings fierce and dread! Sorrow with gentle Natures mild, Gentler thou surely art— Thy fiery power to sting and scourge, Comes from the fiery heart. Thy minister it ever is, Thy powerful strong ally— What were the clouds without the winds, To drive them o'er the sky?— Cease my wild heart to beat and burn, And half thy grief is o'er— Cease to torment thyself, and half Thine anguish lives no more. Cease my wild heart to hope and dream, And be prepared to endure— Cease to remember and regret And time may work thy cure! Days of my Childhood ye were fair As Morning and as Spring; But ye are fled—let Memory too, Fleet on as swift a wing! These days are passing passing fast, Their dark goal is the grave, And mighty duties call aloud, And deep attention crave! These days are passing passing fast, My Soul thou'rt passing too; Not here can be thy fixed abode, Thou'rt bound to Regions new! Thour't bound to Regions new and far, Thine everlasting Home! Where thou shalt never more droop faint, In the shadow of the tomb. How canst thou—darest thou cling so much To this poor fleeting Earth, And deem its baubles and its toys Of such exceeding worth? Arise! and fling from ye the weight Of troubled human care— Are there not treasures to be won Of mightier value there? Oh! Childhood's veriest toys were things Of deep and wond'rous weight Compared with things that win us now From all that's high and great! The bubbles and the baubles here, Can they indeed enchain Our Souls to Earth, which like themselves Shall fade, and not remain! SONNET. [Oh, Sleep! I pray thee now to steep my sense] Oh, Sleep! I pray thee now to steep my sense In rich forgetfulness—to hush or charm Away my thronging thoughts, and to disarm Doubt, care, and terror for awhile—intense Their harrowing, harrowing power is, when the immense, The busy Stage of Life to arouse—alarm Is spread before our view, but when thy warm And thy caressing influence wins from thence Our thoughts and doubts, they sink to shadows oft, And richer feelings live along the Soul. Oh! Sleep, come then with all thy whisperings soft, And let the moments tremulously roll Away—like silvery mists that float aloft, As they would fain, fain reach some heavenly goal. SONNET. [Sleep! smile away my sadness, let me sink] Sleep! smile away my sadness, let me sink Into a dear unconsciousness of all Life's toil, Fear's sting, Hope's tremour, and Care's thrall. Oh! let me dream, and so forget to think!— And dreaming rest near some bright streamlet's brink, Where flowers gleam fair, and many a bird doth call, And many a breeze doth freshening rise and fall, Whose hushing sighs and murmurs I would drink Ev'n to my very Soul—that fainteth now For one deep dewy draught of full repose, That it may never find strange life! where thou Art spreading forth thy snares!—thy tempting shows Displaying to these eyes!—this aching brow Weighs o'er the languid lids that would for ever close! SONNET. [Peace!—perfect Peace—with Slumber come and fall] Peace!—perfect Peace—with Slumber come and fall Like dew of Heaven upon my Soul, I shrink From mine own thoughts, that hover round the brink Of deepest Mysteries still, and Sleep's soft pall Would fain throw round them and enshroud them all. Too curiously and carefully we think, And poison of our own fond brewing drink— Let me forget the arrow and the gall— Let me resign the trouble and the pain— Let me forswear the vain, vain chase and toil— Let me unlink the choaking, clasping chain— Wipe off the shadow and remove the soil, Lift the dread burthen, Sleep! from heart and brain, My thoughts—thy Victory's many coloured Spoil! SONNET. [A clear rill brightly wound its silvery way] A clear rill brightly wound its silvery way, Smooth through the umbrageous sylvanry around, And as caressingly about, it wound Its still small voice of music seemed to stay On the ear in lulling murmurs, while the gray And shadowy twilight deepened still, and found Amidst the massy trees that did abound Een there—a kindred twilight, that all day Dwelt deep beneath their thick o'erhanging gloom! Oh! lovely scene where all enchantment dwells! If the Heart knows to prize it,—if the bloom Of youth and love be on it!—Oh! the Dells— The Woods—the Rills—strange Beauty now assume, That tame makes Fancy's charm—of which the Poet tells! SONNET ON MY CHILD'S BIRTH-DAY. My child! how welcome is to me this hour, This day! thy day of birth—what wishes fond That reach this life—the tomb, the stars beyond, My rapt Soul pours with full and feeling power, Upon this Morning air, while every flower Smiles Welcome—as a gentle task it conned To thee, fair Human Flower! Oh! holiest bond— Mother and child uniting—sun nor shower, Nor calm, nor storm, changes of time nor clime, Shall ever loosen this most blessed tie— In purity's perfection how sublime! Years pass, and hopes and dreams and feelings fly, They're gone, like rosy clouds that gild day's prime— But this Affection's truth cannot be taught to die! SONNET. [Sweet is the stillness of this evening hour] Sweet is the stillness of this evening hour, And beauteous its repose—the clouds above Have not yet lost the flush, the glow of love, The orient hue of joy—yet in the bower, Where the light leaves, confess the still time's power!— And in the glade, seems nothing now to move!— Sleep's honey dews oppress the lark and dove. Long thou'st been silent, thou! the pride and flower Of all thy kindred tribes, sweet lark! that high Doth in the morning's hours of beauty soar, As though thou wouldst for ever haunt the sky; But thy rich matins and pure carols o'er, How dost thou seek thy nest's sweet privacy— As though thou would'st ascend Heaven's heights no more! MY EARTHWARD-CLINGING HOPES. My earthward-clinging Hopes arise, Like eagles rushing to the Skies, There is your quarry, there your goal, My Hopes arise, and raise my Soul. My earthward-clinging Hopes no more Be anchored near Life's barren shore, Enter at once upon the Sea Of boundless, bright Eternity. Dwell not on Earth with vainest love, Soar to the mighty Heavens above, Though I myself may not be there, Ye may precede me—pure and fair. My Hopes!—my Hopes!—ye there may be Far launched into th' Eternity, What may oppose ye—what restrain— You nothing know of bar or chain. The Heaven above, the Eternal dome, Appears as 'twere your natural Home, All is too narrow here beneath, And still ye clash with scowling Death. My Hopes, my winged Hopes arise, Like eagles spring into the skies, Make all its glorious light your own, Ye that have long too wildly flown. Ye that have wildly flown and far, But not to sun, and not to star, But to the meteor's fleeting light, That shines too treacherously bright. BEAUTIFUL SUMMER. Beautiful Summer! com'st thou back Breathing deep glory on thy track, With all thy roses—all thy rays— A burning bloom—a boundless blaze? Thy Roses! Oh! to them, to them Thou ow'st thy brightest diadem! Queens of the Sunshine!—how they fling Their charm o'er each less beauteous thing! Queens of the Sunshine!—how they shed The glory of their rosy red O'er all around triumphantly, And deepen still their crimson dye! The Lord of Day o'er them pours down The fairest splendours of his crown, Then basks he smilingly the while In the rich Earth-light of their smile! In the Earth-light of their smile!—for far Each sheds around—(a blazing Star!—) Its beauty on the atmosphere, And makes a glowing Eden near! Upon their leaves the Lord of Day Rises with rich and roseate ray, And in their burning hearts of fire Doth in a deepened blaze expire! Queens of the Sunshine!—how they fling Beauty o'er each surrounding thing, And gild the light, and flush the day, As with a more cœlestial ray! Beautiful Summer! com'st thou back Even now with triumph on thy track? Oh! couldst thou linger in our bowers, A Paradise once more were ours! THE SEA AT TERRACINA. Most bright, and beautiful, and gentle Seas, Caressed by the odourous amourous southern breeze, Surely had Aphrodite—Heaven-bless'd Fair! With her celestial eyes and golden hair!— The sea-born Aphrodite sprang from ye, She had renounced the Heaven, and in the Sea Remained—until that golden hair and bright Had caught the softest hue of sea-green light Which the long locks of those pure sisters fair— The Maidens of the Main—so richly wear. They that in sweet-linked dance pass swimmingly Through coral fretted grots of the under-sea, To celebrate their ocean festivals In their dread Sire's abodes—great Neptune's halls— Their foam-light locks, curled like the curling spray That round their soft fair moonlight features play; Clustered with Sea-flower-victory-wreaths fresh twined— Dew dropped with pearls, from dim shells disenshrined— Clustered with glistening Sea-flower-victory-wreathes,— Whose every leaf an ocean-odour breathes! OH! THAT MY HEART. Oh! that my Heart—my burning Heart— Were as a spark of fire, To die when trampled on at once— At once—even then to expire! Oh! that my Life—one Passion still, My wild and weary Life— Might like an o'erstrained chord give way Beneath this troublous strife. Oh! that my Soul, that dreameth still, Might grow one deep, deep dream, And float down all unconsciously On Destiny's dread stream. But thou, my heart, still beatest on, Though trodden underfoot— My Life—though wrung and tortured still, Thy deep chords are not mute. My Soul still dreameth, yet is still Of every grief the prey, Through every Vision that it sees Reality makes way! My Life, my Heart, my Soul, are all Grief's subjects and her spoil— Oh! Earth, thou art of wretchedness The fertile native soil! I BLESS THEE, LOVE! I bless thee, Love! rejoicing that at length In all thy pure perfection's finest strength Thou fill'st this heart of feeling and of fire, Till thee, and thee alone, doth it respire! Now through this life may I for ever move, Girt with the elastic panoply of Love— Beholding but his beauty still displayed In this fair world so excellently made. Girt with the elastic panoply of Love, No doubts my Soul shall nurse—no terror prove— How can I know the faultering of a fear When that celestial Power is ever near? Love! thou canst make, all potent that thou art, This Earth—a fairy world of the deep heart; All things are changed by thy resistless wand, All things remodelled by thy forming hand! Thou wert a Light ere yet the Sun was made, And thou shalt be when he even is decayed, With all the lights that crowd the eternal space, And run rejoicing their triumphant race. Thou art a world within the Soul sublime, And Love! thou art Eternity in time!— Creation in the chaos of our life, And Eden in the world's wild waste of strife. Thou art the breath of Heaven within the heart, The shadow of the Unutterable thou art— The keys of Heaven and Earth are surely thine, And all their deathless treasures and divine. If we love not our Brethren—we are then Pent in ourselves—that dreariest prison-den! The universe was made not for the one, Through Love 'tis understood, enjoyed alone! PARODY ON THE FINE OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN. We will sing you a very perfect song, made by a perfect pate, Of a fine Young English Lady fair, whose face is her estate, Whose features are her fortunes all—Oh! how lucky 'twas that fate Made this face to be well favoured, so that none could underrate This fine Young English Lady fair, one of the present time. What a fine Young English Lady is, perhaps you may not know, Attend a little then whilst I attempt to tell and show, For a compound very strange it is, as you will all allow, When I disclose the truth to you, and bid you make your bow To this fine Young English Lady fair, one of the present time. She's made of the vanities in vogue—veils, velvets, vinaigrettes, Flounces, feathers, fans, flowers, furbelows, ribbons, reticules, rosettes, Sarcenets, satins, poplins, palmyreens, gauzes, crapes, blonds, silks, and nets, Lo! the table's strewn with billets doux, cards, knick-knacks, alumettes. For this fine Young English Lady fair, &amp;c. Behold her when she first sweeps forth, crowned with all her conquering charms, With perhaps a choice curl on her cheek, and a pet dog in her arms, With pretty sentences by scores, and with playful smiles by swarms; If the nonsense which she talks disgusts, why the smile your wrath disarms, Of this fine Young English Lady fair, &amp;c. She can ride like any Amazon, like Bohemian trampers walk— She can draw in Seppia, crayons, ink, oils, water-colours, chalk, In the talkee-talkee lingua versed—Oh! ye Gods! how she can talk; Nay, all tongues from the Ethiop's lisping prate, to the grunt of the Mohawk!— This fine Young English Lady fair, &amp;c. Sure our Forefathers did wisely act, ev'n those from whom we're sprung, Since they had our stately Mothers taught but the ancient Mother tongue; But now the clappers of our Belles, they're so wonderously well strung, Their tongues try every tongue on Earth—Oh! what deafening peals they've rung, All these fine Young English Ladies fair, Belles of the present time!— Such a chattering ne'er in Christendom, methinks, was heard before, Magpies, monkeys, parrots, starlings, jays, long have given their glib trade o'er— Long long have these been silenced all, for they could be heard no more, May be, since they but one language know, while our damsels know a score. These fine Young English Ladies fair, &amp;c. Italian, German, Spanish, French, Russian, Dutch, and Portuguese, They speak with volubility, and fluency, and ease; How can they ever fail indeed, to captivate and please?— Since their sweet nonsense, they can breathe in every one of these. These fine Young English Ladies fair, &amp;c. To the Opera and French play so gay, our fair Young Lady goes, And then to some late ball, where she may meet with those she knows; With her one thousand friends, she there exchanges nods and bows, While tires her sleepy chaperon quite, who sighs for some repose— This fine Young English Lady fair, &amp;c. In her Opera box enshrined, but seldom turns she to the stage, Though the Grisi and Persiani there, the warblers of the age, Sing sweetly to that prisoned bird in her very narrow cage, For a delicate flirtation 'tis doth daintily engage The fine Young English Lady fair, &amp;c. Her mornings are with Milliners and Mantua-Makers past, And with interests so profound to fill, they doubtless speed on fast;— Long undecided dwells she on some question deep of taste, Of vast and dread importance, as the Life, hung on this cast Of this Fine Young English Lady Fair, &amp;c. At Fancy Fairs she has her stall, where what cart-loads doth she sell, Of trash and trumpery Frippery,—far, far more than I can tell,— Behold! what weighty, deep affairs employ our modern Belle! But her life's most arduous duty yet, must still be—to look well!— This Fine Young English Lady Fair, &amp;c. At Fancy Balls—(for Charity as well as Fancy Fairs)— The frippery and the trumpery trash herself she kindly wears— See the Shepherdess of the Upper Alps climbing th' Alps of crowded stairs! Or the gentle Nun, there playing off all the gay coquettish airs Of a Fine Young English Lady Fair, &amp;c. Then a Fine Young English Gentleman, who drives, hunts, fishes, skaites, To our Fine Young English Lady Fair he with pleasing small-talk prates; But he praises much her cousin's charms, and his approbation states Of Miss Harriet's air, and mien, and face—and oh! how the avowal grates On our Fine Young English Lady Fair, &amp;c. What a dolt and blockhead must he be who does not fully know That his suit could never prosper thus—what a witless brainless Beau! Oh! there's nothing that they hate and loathe and abominate below, Like other Fine Young Ladies fair with equal charms I trow, These Fine Young English Ladies Fair, those of the present time! THE CHARMS OF MORNING. The glowing stillness of the Morning's Skies Thrill to the Lark's clear brilliant harmonies— Those Skies that deepen and that ripen soon To the fine festal pride of full-blown Noon! Fair Day!—thou'rt like a most resplendent rose That slowly to its crowned perfection blows; But, Oh! the Rose-bud Morning hath not less Than ripened Noon of conquering loveliness! Morning! I love thee to my very Soul! Thy dew-soft Clouds, that pearly-gleaming roll And the fresh wildness of thy new-born airs! Oh! these I love and thee, 'mid griefs and cares! I love thee to my Soul!—to me—to me Time seems the Morning of Eternity! Our being but the Morning of that Life We yet shall live with boundless raptures rife! All that we know and see is Morning yet— Spring of a Day whose Sun shall never set! We are the Sons of Morning, and the Heirs Of the everlasting Day that Heaven prepares! THE ONE HOPE. I wept and wailed, Strange fears assailed, A thousand hosts of torturing fears— But thoughts of thee Soon rose to be Suns—making rainbows of my tears!— Those thoughts of light Brought strength—brought might— Brought Hope, the Archangel of the Soul, That soon subdued With fearless mood, The foes that sought to o'erthrow the whole! Deep thoughts of thee Shall ever be My pride, and glory, and defence— When they're enshrined Within my mind— They chase Pain's legioned powers from thence. More—more I owe Than life below, To thee, my thought's bright starry goal I may not droop— On me smiles Hope— The mailed Archangel of the Soul! To thee alone, Beloved One, The blessings that I reap, I owe, I owe to thee, Felicity— That I ne'er dreamed of yet below. To thee I owe, I deeply know, My very Soul's unwithered powers— These had sunk down— Destroyed—o'erthrown Beneath Grief's weight of weary hours. These had been lost Had Hope ne'er crossed My mind's dark gloom—to bring relief, With its deep light, With kindling might— Oh! who can bear unmingled Grief! The unmingled Grief, Without relief, The unlightened load, the unsoftened strife, Must soon indeed To ruin lead— The Soul pierced deep through its own life! It dies—not one Dark death alone— But many a stern and shadowy death, When once pierced through, With aim too true, Its own deep life—within the sheath! When once the wound Its depths hath found, It dies as much as Soul can die— Since still revives, Still lingering lives— The pilgrim of Eternity!— If one bright Hope With Grief to cope, Within that conscious Soul remain, From its hushed deep That Hope doth keep Away the threatening powers of Pain! Around they stand With flaming brand— Sting, scourge, and instrument of ill, They stand around!— Those depths profound— They dare not pierce—unwounded still! That Hope is shrined In the inmost mind, Unmoved by strife and restless din— That, that remains, And proudly reigns The Soul's own farthest shrine within! That Hope is fixed, Unmerged—unmixed, Within the Spirit's centre still— The Hope lives there, The Grief—the Care, Ruffle the surface at their will! The Care—the Pain— E'en there remain— That Hope inhabits evermore The Spirit's shrine— The Mind's veiled mine— The bosom's secret cell and core! Fixed in the Soul, Throughout the whole, A keen and fervent glow it sheds!— Till every thought Its light hath caught, And each an added brightness spreads! The Pain—the Care— Their shadows there Fling dark with a certain bound, While they e'en win From light within A colouring tender and profound!— Should once that Hope Take flight or droop— Dark is the change—and deep and dread— The Griefs crowd in, And straight begin Their savage anarchies to spread! Oh! Hope, if thou Dost quail—dost bow— Ruin comes rushing as a cloud O'er all our life— Till wrath and strife Bend us as frailest reeds are bowed! Where thou art not, Our human lot Is heavy and is harsh to bear— Then ev'ry grief Without relief Becomes a dark distinct Despair! Ev'n lesser woes That Nature knows Can plunge the Soul in worse eclipse Than Griefs more stern, That yet can learn A lovely lesson from thy lips! Far lesser pains Can bind in chains Of adamantine clasp and link, Where thou smil'st not To cheer our lot, And raise the heart that else must sink! A kindred thing With wand and wing Thou to the Soul's depths spring'st at once, The Soul receives, And clings and cleaves To that sweet guest and yields response! Pure kindred things, Each cleaves and clings Unto the other fondly well, And while they so Together grow, Vainly shall Fate's dark tempests swell! One Hope alone This Soul hath known, And many a deadly grief and care, That Hope hath long From fated wrong My life preserved—and from Despair! One Hope—but one, And that alone— Hath bid Life's parched hot desert bloom Fair as the Rose Warm Summer knows— And brightened all the frowning gloom! I wept—I wailed— Doubts, fears assailed, Unnumbered doubts—unnumbered fears, Till thoughts of thee Arose to be Suns making rainbows of my tears. To thee then—thee— I still must be Indebted more than words can show— The Hope thou'st given Spreads arched like Heaven O'er all my world of waste and woe! My griefs—my fears— Thy smile endears— I scarcely shrink from them away; Like serpents charmed, Subdued, disarmed, My sorrows own my soft Hope's sway. Thanks for this peace That shall not cease, Thanks for this triumph—for this trust; I may not sink, I may not shrink, I spurn this Earth of clay and dust! Hope, Hope, makes bright With Heavenly Light The crowned spirits of my thought— They win and wear, From her all fair, A hue divine—from far realms caught. Hope, Hope, doth cast Quick splendours fast, Which from her native climes are brought; For evermore Full brightly o'er The immortal spirits of my thought! For, Oh! how fair Those shapes of air, The Beings from the deep Soul born!— That cheer our day, That soothe our way, Without which, we were left forlorn! These touched by Hope— A smiling troop, All love and loveliness appear, And brightly thus Make populous Our World—an Angel-haunted Sphere! And all this done By one alone— One single lone—sole-springing Hope! Oh! give me more; Let joy run o'er!— The Mind's vast gates of glory ope! Let me but feel All woes to heal, All griefs to banish and suppress— That thou lov'st too With love as true— As deep in its Divine excess. I wept and wailed— Dull fears assailed— A thousand hosts of trembling fears; Till thoughts of thee Rose bright—to be Suns making rainbows of my tears! Those thoughts shall shine Yet more divine With light empyreal and august, If I may dream Thy sweet thoughts beam With answering triumph—mutual trust! 'Twas bliss, 'twas joy, Too deep to cloy, Thus loving thee with perfect love; But, Oh! the excess Of happiness— The joys of answered Love to prove! Let these be mine— Ah! deign incline Thine ear to my impassioned prayer— Increase the debt Profoundly yet, And all the wealth thou giv'st—but share! So, only so, The debt I owe Can be mysteriously effaced; This thou must pay (Some thrice-blessed day) Thyself—and with no love misplaced! Thou too shalt love— Thou too shalt prove The feeling that alone can raise From Earth—from doom— From grief and gloom, And win us from Care's thorny ways. Then thoughts of thee Shall brightly be Unto this Soul, in their rich might, Supremely still— Unmixed with ill, Like opening Heavens of Living Light! A SMILE. A Smile like a thousand zephyrs plays, With its changing and flashing, and fleeting rays, Round thy lovely lips that so rose-like be, Like a thousand zephyrs, the light and free, That fling freshess and beauty around the rose, Which yet brighter for their soft presence glows. Like a thousand zephyrs, the light the free, Like a thousand sunbeams of radiancy, That shine out and sparkle quick, clear, and bright, With tints of pure glory and trails of light! Yet varying still as a varying doubt, While shedding this splendour of beauty about. Oh! say—doth that smile type thy gentle heart? On the wings of change doth that fluttering dart?— Doth that vary for ever and evermore, Like waves that in different shapes seek the shore?— Or like breezes that still carry change in their train, Or aught that's inconstant, and varying and vain? No, I will not think it—it must not be, Oh! worse than death would it be to me. Methinks thou hast loved me—methinks thou hast known To love me well, and to love me alone. But, Oh! if a change should come now o'er thy mind, If now thou canst fickle be, false, and unkind; Oh! thy bye-past love a vain thing I call, And I would thou hadst never loved at all! SWEET FLOWERS. Sweet flowers! ye fair and ever new delights, That shed a smile o'er this dark world of blights, And clouds and frowns, how brightly laugh ye forth, In all your loveliest pride and richest worth. After these Summer showers—it is indeed Enchantment now—each heat-dejected head Is lifted up in beauty fresh and bright. These stars of day, like those that burn at night, Now twinkle with the radiance of the shower, That sets them round with jewels—every bower Hath many a coloured constellation now, And doth rekindle with a blushful glow; Each leaf is diamond-dropt—and seems to be A shining part of some bright galaxy— The eye half wearied by the startling glare, Turns to the sky to look for shadows there!— And surely 'tis more sobered more subdued, Than this now sparkling Earth and many-hued, Which seems of every different brightness blent, E'en to change places with the Firmament! To wear its glories, and display its sheen, And smile a radiant and etherial scene! To win its splendours and its pride assume, And emulate the starry-clustered dome. And, Oh! no marvel it appears more bright, So closely dazzling on the ravished sight! No marvel it should lovelier still appear, In all its loveliness beheld so near; Until the eye half wearied by the glare, Turns to the sky to look for shadows there!— Turns to the glorious, the resplendent sky, To look for shadows 'mid its brilliancy! And almost findeth there for season brief, The quiet of repose and soft relief— For Earth's thick-jewelled front too brightly glows, For any dream of quiet or repose. And Heaven by contrast sober-suited seems, Though there—though thence the flooding sunshine streams! Its quivering stars are hid in shroud of light, Beneath they seem redoubled to our sight! NATURE'S SCENES. Nature! thou call'st us with a mighty voice, To share thy noble and ennobling joys, Those that to all thou profferest! Oh! I come— But let me share the rich, deep, solemn gloom— The calm—the hush—that in far fair retreats Invite the heart that all too wildly beats, To lay down every care, to court repose, And hail the hour that sees its turmoil close Then take me and be thou my nurse, ev'en thou— Oh! take me to thy lulling bosom now, And win these weary eyes with Sorrow wet, Their hopeless tears and achings to forget, And win them to forget the haunting forms (Pale phantom aspects, which in life-pulse warms) That coldly crowd upon them evermore, And wear the looks departed dear ones wore. 'Tis thou alone canst soothe, and bless, and calm, And in the place of poisons give us balm; To thee I fly, long wearied and afraid, But to thy deepest hush of loneliest shade— For by degrees—the healing touch must come Unto the wrung and wounded bosom home. First must the bitterness of anguish cease, Then softly spread the dewy calms of Peace, To usher in serenity of bliss, That ever grows from such a peace as this— A true, a tender, and a tranquil joy, Too true—too pure—to weary or to cloy!— Oh, Nature! unto thee, heart sick I come— First let me seek thy rich, deep, solemn gloom, Then on my Soul in full effulgence beam— In all thy mighty loveliness supreme! VIOLETS. Oh! the Violets—the Violets throw Around their own imperial glow, Like sweet Stars that so long did move In the deep sapphire Heavens above, That all those Heaven's rich colourings met, Within their smiles of Beauty set!— That all the Sky's triumphal blue, Shone gathering in their glorious hue! The Violets—the Violets throw Around their own imperial glow Of queenly purple, full and deep— Where they brood in odorous heap; And like they are to stars of light, That long, Oh! long serene and bright Have moved in yon cerulean Skies, Till thence they caught e'en all their dyes— Till that sapphire world's hues met All in crowning fulness set, In their deep rich flowery smiles, Which nought of this dull earth defiles! The violets!—Oh! how they throw Around their own imperial glow Their purple light of richest dye, Paving Earth with smiles of Sky! But more we bless them for the scent Wherewith Air's common element They do enrich so much and well, More than cunning phrase may tell, That burthened Air seems, breath by breath, To languish in a costly death, Beneath that odour's tender weight, A delicate yet cumbering freight! That odour which, profound and rare, Luxuriates here and every where! Who of your beauty thinks, Sweet Flowers!— Endowed with almost magic powers, Though beautiful ye are indeed— But e'en the lowliest, homeliest weed, Of form uncouth and pallid dyes, Were beauteous in our partial eyes, With such an incense-breath intense As yours, that thrills the quickened sense— That pierces and that penetrates Unto that sense it never sates!— Unto the Soul itself—that lives A Life that outward Nature gives, Still fluctuating to her fine mood, With many a kindred sense endued, Beside that inner life profound, Without a fetter or a bound; That to nought outward ever may Vary or veer from day to day! (Fixed in itself for ever more— A mighty sea without a shore— A life that doth sublimely seem One glorious current, one deep stream, Uninterrupted in its course, And springing from the highest source!) Oh! Nature, with thee we owe, While yet we wander here below, A life of purest consciousness, Which mild emotions sweetly bless; Though mild yet deep—and full of power To colour every passing hour. To make a lovely life apart, Even of the dreaming, feeling heart! SONNET. [This eve is lovely as the day hath been] This eve is lovely as the day hath been, An evening fair as is the scenery even That it now steeps in stillness—calm yon Heaven Of azure luxury smiles!—waves flow serene!— Smile calm the unruffled breathless vineyards, green With their first verdurous livery—now are driven Deep shades through the air—all power to Peace is given! And calm as Peace grows all the altered scene; Of human stir and strife speaks nothing here, But Earth herself with Heaven seems communing; Whate'er her sons, poor slaves of Hope and Fear, May reck of vainly, they of the Eagle's wing, But oft the Owlet's eye, that when most near To keenest splendours, grows a darkened thing! SONNET. [It is a tender yet triumphant hour!] It is a tender yet triumphant hour! Most glorious Morning! How thy deepening rays Promise the loveliest, brightest of all days! And, Oh! that promise is as full of power As its fulfilment can be, when a shower Of dazzling splendours sets proud Noon ablaze, And beams the full-blown Day upon the gaze, And golden glow the Stream, the Bank, the Flower! Sparkling with Dew, like rich Stars turned to Tears! Shines all the Ground's bright surface tremblingly!— How soft and yet how vivid all appears!— Most glorious Morning, o'er Parthenope, Thou shed'st a charm that e'en still more endears, Lending her more and more of witchery! Naples. SONNET. [The Sun hath sunk with stately march and slow!] The Sun hath sunk with stately march and slow! 'Tis Evening. In the Horizon far away, The quick bright Lightnings make a mimick Day; The great Heavens seem to throb with them; but no, It is but near our Earth that sudden glow, That startling rapid flash—that hurried play Of many splendours, that a moment stay, Then sink as rapidly—a fleeting show! The Eternal Heavens, unconscious of them, are, In their firm steadfastness, a changeless frame Unconscious of them every glorious star That sets the ancient front of Night on flame! The Lightnings near us spring, though seeming far, As though from highest heights of Heav'n they came! FROM “INEZ,” A MS. POEM. Sorrows that wring the very heart, Are now my portion and my part; Fears, each more dreadful than the last, Crowd on my fancy full and fast— Regrets that all my Soul consume, Hover like spectres round a tomb— About my memory's haunted cell, Peopled too widely and too well! Hope is a faint remembered thing, Far in the distance vanishing— Joy seems a dream that once dreamed through, No after effort can renew. Peace is a slumber of the Soul, From whose serene and soft controul Escaping once, that Soul must bear The burthen of a sleepless care. Once from the awakened Spirit driven, Sweet Peace flies to its Native Heaven, And never more on Earth may lull The Soul, of doubts, fears, troubles—full! Hope, Joy, and Peace—farewell, farewell! No more with ye I now must dwell; But Sufferance, Pain, and Doubt, and Dread, Must be my gloomy mates instead— And welcome to my Soul ere they That vex my Night and cloud my day, Welcome, because from love they spring Life's only pure and perfect thing— Hope, Joy, and Peace—begone, depart— Ye're nothing to my Mind and Heart Compared with that enchanted dream, Which gilds the Sun with added beam, Which cloathes Creation with delight, Howe'er the burning Soul it smite!— Come every sorrow in excess, Love still is his own happiness! 'Mid all his own o'er wrought despair, Of boundless blessings is he heir— For to himself he still must be A Fountain of Felicity. A happiness with naught beside On Earth commingled or allied, A Happiness unnamed on Earth, E'en of the highest Heavenly birth. Peace, Hope, and Joy, farewell, farewell! No more with ye I wish to dwell— I seek not now your charms to prove, Oh! what are ye to Love—deep Love? Sorrows, that never may depart, That lacerate the very heart With long, long torture, fierce but slow, A dull monotony of woe— Despairs that sting the Soul to death, And leave of Life alone the breath!— Fears each more fearful than the last, Pass not! lest Love with ye fleet past! SONNET. [Bright Noon, and cloudless!—what an Arch of Pride] Bright Noon, and cloudless!—what an Arch of Pride These blue triumphal Heavens now form above— An Arch of Pride yet breathing of deep love, In their grave pure serenity—how wide The smooth expanse—all brightly richly dyed With one most glorious hue, yet yon fair grove With all its changeful beauty doth not move More admiration than that purple tide!— A tide of one unstirred unbroken wave, Untroubled, save with splendour-rufflings keen!— For else, 'tis still and silent as the grave! Oh! sweet repose in Heaven!—profound—serene— Our souls with that some kindred feeling crave, And gaze themselves away on that calm scene! THE DEATH OF HOPE. Affections ever beautiful and young Keep still their strongholds in my heart though strung No more upon a deep harmonious Hope— With every fear and doubt right strong to cope— Like rich pearls on a string of silken twine, That glistening through lends these a softer shine, And gives them order, unity, and strength— Alas! Hope's silken twine is loosed at length! I love—I still love on—but well I know My love beginneth and must end in woe! No Hope can ever warm this heart again, But 'tis resigned to suffering and to pain; And haply in this harsh, harsh world, where grief A long dark season hath—but joy is brief, Such resignation in its tranquil mood, Unshaken in its firmness, unsubdued, Is more than very happiness—that lies So open to all life's inclemencies— So fragile and so weakly in its frame— Breathed on by breath of change, 'tis but a name! More, more than happiness, since formed to brunt The war of storms—the darkness' cloudy front, The change—the fret of circumstance—the bane— Probation's fang—and the keen file of pain. Be mine then—firm-fixed resignation still— That counter-balanceth the opposing ill! And mine those pure affections deep and true, That seem for ever beautiful and new— That have so much of hidden inborn power, They live without Hope's aid, their lovely hour. Themselves so like to Happiness and Hope, They cannot darkly fail, nor faintly droop! Within themselves seems shadowed forth so fair, (Lightly as rests the rainbow on the air! The stars' reflection on the waters' breast, The dews that on the glowing flower-cups rest)— All promise—all felicity—howe'er By fate they may be doomed to grief and care While still themselves unto themselves must be More than all Hope and all Felicity! FANCY AND FEELING. As torrent-streams—wild torrents flow to the ocean, With the thunders and the lightnings of their might, Thus to the depths of one Supreme Emotion Flow all my thoughts—the shadowy and the bright! High in the crests and summits of the mountains, The waters' urns may be—yet down they flow!— In Fancy's Eyrie-heights are my Thought's fountains, But, Oh! how swift and soon they flash below! From Heaven to Earth seem rolling down those Waters Whose course is in the mountain-heights begun; The sky-kissed Mountains—Nature's eldest daughters— With rosy foreheads blushing at the Sun! But, Oh! in flashing foam and hurry pouring, Those quivering lines of Light, all scattered far, May pause not for reflecting or adoring Until they reach the plains that lowlier are! Then on their calmer way to the outstretched Ocean The smoother rivers glass—the Heavens serene— Forgetting all their restless wild commotion, And all o'er pictured with the ethereal scene! Then shines the fervid blue, the stars then glisten Upon their surface, as in the upper Sky They warble on their way—yet warbling listen, Methinks, as they would learn Heaven's harmony! And so from Fancy's Eyrie heights descending, As though it were indeed from Heaven to Earth, These thoughts float down, to one emotion tending— Destined for that, e'n from their loftiest birth! But fallen from thy far heights—Imagination, More Heavenly hues how gloriously they wear, Losing that hurried flush of agitation Which ruffled them before, though ever fair! Then do they mirror back—and most serenely— The Sunshine-skies of Beauty spread above— Around them Love's own bowers rise freshly, greenly— Above them, those bright Firmaments of Love! Thus do these thoughts, made Streams of deep Affections, Sinking in calm humility, become All beautiful and bright, with rich reflections Of all that most exceeds our earthly doom! 'Tis not midst Fancy's Eyrie-peaks—high soaring, That they indeed Heaven's Sun-lit smile have won; 'Tis in the smoother depths of still adoring, When Heaven seems resting their clear glass upon! My thoughts, like torrents spring, Imagination, Even from thy mountain-summits evermore; But drawn to one Emotion's adoration, Like rivers seek the sea—that sea their shore! To that one passion of Emotion tending, My thoughts forget their far and dreamy birth, And in the depths of that Emotion ending, They seem to bring the distant Heaven to Earth! That which they did but seek with vain aspiring, They then commingle with in strict embrace— No more into themselves appear retiring— The ethereal regions beautifying Space! Not with those Worlds immortal are they blending When throned at the highest of Earth's petty height, But Heaven itself seems down on them descending When stilled they lie, subdued by their own might! Oh! my quick thoughts, from far Imagination Down sinking fast—to your sole Sea ye flow, And in those Heaven-touched deeps of Adoration Remain—exalted more—thus lapsed and low! Fancy and Wisdom—Genius—Inspiration— Our minds may dwell with ye afar—above— Still, still to find that Life's best exaltation Must be in loss of Self and gain of Love! As torrent-streams—wild torrents—flow to Ocean, With thunders and with lightnings of their might, So to the depths of one supreme Emotion Flow all my thoughts—the shadowy and the bright! There flows my Soul with all its powers for ever, Renewed, redoubled, and fresh-born to be! Without a dream of effort or endeavour— That Soul, but lives to love, and loves but thee! STANZAS. [I know thee now—false, hollow, that thou art] I know thee now—false, hollow, that thou art, And while one life-pulse quivers in this heart, Must I remain, much pained but pitying more, Feeling for thee, though all my hopes are o'er. I would not change with thee, I could not bear To inflict the sufferings I submissive share; My mind stern Vengeance on itself should take That burthen it imposed this heart should break! Thus I remain much pained, but pitying more, Sorrowing for thee, though all my hopes are o'er! If Love oppressed must such despair endure, Love outraged, by the Heart, shall find no cure! Still shall the Shadow of its murdered life Darken that heart with gloom of Memory's strife. Oh! I must mourn—much pained, but pitying more, Sorrowing for thee, though all my hopes are o'er! ON ?'S BIRTHDAY. I fain would sing—I fain would hail this day, With something more than e'en the general joy, But I must be content to bring the alloy Of weakness in my tributary lay. For still when feelings are most strong, the way To express them is too oft most shy and coy, As language from its burthen shrank—the annoy Of this faint consciousness is mine—I pray Thou wilt forgive such failure, nor refuse To fancy—with thy Fancy fresh and young, All I would say, could I command the muse To aid the futile efforts of my tongue, And thus most surely shall I gain—not lose— My thoughts, so shadowed, shall be more than sung! ON THE SAME. [This happy day!—no light of truth or dream] This happy day!—no light of truth or dream Could add one charm to it—since thy dear birth Hath made it precious—precious! Heaven and Earth Should hail it with a Smile, and would I deem, Had worth its fair dues here!—on Life's broad stream, All, all in doubt, in sadness, or in mirth, Are floated down alike—and midst the dearth Of Natures exquisite as thine, no beam Is consecrate to hail thee brightly thus, On thy birth's morn; yet we who love with true And tender love, feel keen and tremulous A ray of Hope—from Heaven as t'were sped new, Piercing our Souls—but this so sweet to us, Hath with Eternity—not Earth to do! ON THE SAME. [Round us the Morning breaks in beauty, such] Round us the Morning breaks in beauty, such As Morning ever doth sublimely wear! E'en in these wintery months she still shows fair! But we scarce think of this—nor could avouch Whether she smiles or frowns; a thrilling touch Of deep full feeling wakes our hearts—we spare No thoughts to outward objects—our sweet care Is to dwell on kind wishes—and so much Of retrospection as shall bid us bless This morn as being, that of thy dear birth— Ere long, beloved! shall I seek to express Fond gratulations, breathing cheer and mirth; But thoughts too full of feeling's deep excess First seize the Soul—whose wings are chained on Earth! SONNET SUGGESTED BY A GROUPE OF SCULPTURE AT THE CHURCH OF ST. SEVERINO, AT NAPLES. Myriads are caught in thy huge net, Oh! Vice! Most willing prisoners—and for thee they toil, And hug close, closer still their Gordianed coil, And spurn fair Virtue's gems of purest price, Nor mark her glorious light—though twice or thrice They may have felt remorse, and sought to foil Their cunning master—they have laid the oil Of slippery backsliding again—(no nice Regards for her preserving) to their tame And treacherous Souls—most slavish of all slaves, E'en so once more they by their choice became! For whereso'er his dusky hand he waves, They follow on through wrath, and flood, and flame— And each for him the Eternal Misery braves! THE RETURN HOME. O'er the heights, And through the streights, Let us go and let us fly! By the floods, And through the woods, To our native air and sky! Lovely land! The bright and bland— Crowned with festal royal skies— Thou to me Still seem'st to be But the road to where joy lies! Home!—Oh! Home— Sure those who roam Know that word's rich meanings best; Their Souls own In that tone— The language of their life expressed. THE HEART'S POWER. With our staunchless heart-wounds oft, oft we go Where the blue and the laughing waters flow— Where the fresh glad woods send many a sound From their leafy and voiceful shrines profound— And the hills look up to the Heavens above, As if with a yearning of feeling love! And the silvery laugh of that stream is vain, And the voice of these glad woods but seems to complain, And the Hills look barren and blank in their dearth, Not leading to Heaven, though they point from the Earth! Oh! Nature! thy witchery and beauty are vain, For a weight and a wound—a chill and a chain, Unfit us for dwelling in peace where thou art, When Sorrows have breathed the young bloom from the Heart! And it mattereth not that thy soft skyey scene, Uncrossed by one speck-like cloud is serene, That thy Plains are covered with Flowers, whose bloom Would lend a brightness and grace to the Tomb, In the face of the Sun, in the presence of Day, Thy Heart of Despair can in anguish say— “Let there be Darkness” to listening Light, And Nature at once is a sunless Night! FEELING. How in this work-day World, alas! The preciousness of Life doth pass! And oft without our Minds engrossed, Knowing 'tis for ever lost! Oft that preciousness doth pass Like scented Winds, that o'er the grass Lightly, faintly, softly go— We doubt still if they're there or no!— Like tenderest Clouds that gently veil The Sun, with their slight folds and frail— Which we miss not, though we find The Sun shines then to scorch and blind! What is Life's pure preciousness?— Feeling's fresh and deep excess, Which too quickly dies away, Like the blossoms of the May! Feeling, that all gently round The quick heart caressing wound, To shut out selfish, sordid Care, With its cold inhuman glare! To breathe one incense breath new born From the ambrosial Skies of Morn Deep into that Heart's deepest Life, Then dying with no noise nor strife! Unmissed, unmourned—till haply we, Slaves of interest, shudderingly— Find we have, with zeal insane, Toiled for guerdon and for gain— Laboured with one stubborn aim, (With worn out mind and wearied frame!—) Only to our heavy cost, To know we have for ever lost The in-born feeling that could make The Soul in its successes take Aught of pleasure or of pride, Henceforward and for aye denied! We may then invest indeed Those Souls in proud and pompous weed! Stoles of State, and Royal pall— They are vain and useless all! The Soul is still a deadened thing, Waning, wasting, withering!— Oh! they who in the days of old, Brought all ghastly to behold— A pale corse from the charnel's scene, And crowned the breathless Inez Inez De Castro. Queen! Did not, e'en then, lose more their toil, Investing her with princely spoil, Than they who vainly load and deck The Spirit's loveless, lifeless wreck, With gifts and treasures of the Earth, When it no more can weigh their worth! Oh! Feeling! when thy thrilling Lyre Once ceaseth, ceaseth to respire Those tones that waken Earth and Sky To one deep Music of reply— How doth our consciousness then seem Like a heavy haunting dream, Dull and dim, and vague, and vain, Faint echo of a finished strain! 'Tis Feeling only that can give The life Immortal Souls should live— What were to us the Seraph's lot. If we its good perceiv?d not? Or Empire wide as space is wide, If we lacked Energy and Pride— Or every glory—every good— If we failed in the accordant mood. SONNETS TO DR. W? ON HIS PROJECTED NEW TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE. [Proclaim the proud Truth to the Hills and Wolds] Proclaim the proud Truth to the Hills and Wolds, Where'er great Nature smiles, and wheresoe'er Philosophy, high-throned on Sovereign chair, Her sphery-sessioned arbitration holds— Then shall Man's lofty thoughts in worthier moulds Be well recast—and with her serpent hair That dark Medusa Prejudice from her lair Shall be ejected—with that fierce hair's folds Dishevelled—with those cold eyes reft of power, So shall she be exorcized from the Earth— While Truth shall revel in his Victory's hour!— Proclaim it thou! whilst stead of this dim dearth Of Hopes to some held forth, who nobly shower Their Thoughts' wealth round—all tongues shall sound their worth! TO THE SAME. [Leap thou i'the Gulph!—Oh! let it be thy pride] Leap thou i'the Gulph!—Oh! let it be thy pride To make thyself the Victim!—let the rage Of criticism's ravenous wolves assuage Itself on thee, and although unallied, Unaided, stand thou firm—mailed in the tried Celestial-tempered panoply o'the sage Philosopher and zealot—Truth!—they wage Their wordy war.—So let them, far and wide! Still meet them with the high repulse and calm Of wisdom, Faith, and Virtue.—Days may come When thy much honoured name may bear the palm 'Midst Benefactors of Mankind—the gloom Of Ignorance may melt—the querulous qualm Of Prejudice pass o'er—with all, as now with some! TO THE SAME. [Seek'st thou—proud aim!—to wholly reconcile] Seek'st thou—proud aim!—to wholly reconcile Religion with the orbed Philosophy Severed on Earth, but single in the Sky? Good Angels guide thee in thy task the while! All Heaven upon thy hallowed labours smile! High is thine object—be thine office high, Thus marrying Majesty to Majesty! Antagonizing Faction—dull and vile!— Shall men not date their Peace of Mind—oft wrecked— From thine hour's triumph!—the old dim desperate feud, 'Twixt Science and palm'd Revelation checked! (While each through each shall be more clearly viewed—) Go forth—give way not to the stubborn-necked! Crown thy great Work!—and God pronounce it good! TO THE SAME. [Utter thy tidings forth—nor let the world] Utter thy tidings forth—nor let the world I'the serpent Error's folds lie longer now— Oh! utter forth those glorious tidings—thou! Who at that serpent, Truth's keen bolt hast hurled, Be the starred scroll, triumphantly unfurled— Let all Mankind their strong belief avow! Let Ignorance hide close her withered brow, With Superstition's slippery beads empearled— Let Prejudice forego her poisonous hold, On sacred things—which she doth desecrate! Be those bright tidings full and loudly told— Oh! holiest task, to give more strength—more weight To Justice—Mercy—Wisdom—Love—to unfold Deep truths, which shall exalt Man's present State! TO THE SAME. [I say not, do not fear:—Fear were afraid] I say not, do not fear:—Fear were afraid To come near thee in such a crisis hour Of Man's high destiny!—a mighty power Surely upholds thee through the impending shade Of difficulties now, and not betrayed Art thou to listen unto aught, nor cower To aught that might at all disturb or lower Thy mind from its great purpose, or degrade Thy thoughts from their high aim—tho' round thee shower Rash Envy's bolts and shafts—and brand and blade Uplifted be to obstruct? Fruition's dower Shall surely crown thy Hope!—still undelayed By doubt or dread—climb thou the steep, and tower On high, and ask from Heaven—and Heaven alone—just aid! TO THE SAME. [Pass on and persevere!—pass calmly on—] Pass on and persevere!—pass calmly on— Addressed to thy high task; nor hope nor fear Man's frown or smile!—Oh! nobly persevere, And lay thy labour's fruit at the dread Throne Of that Omnipotence to whom alone They're dedicate in deep devotion—here High, high o'er ethered space—o'er systemed sphere— Thy Heaven-ward Hope, the Seraph-plumed, hath flown, Yet with humility and lowly trust, (Source of all strength—true spring of all success!) Thou'rt surely girt to atchieve thy task august; For it may prosper but as Heaven shall bless!— Our deeds and darings, tend like us to dust, And need most help when most, upreared in loftiness! TO THE SAME. [If thou atchievest what thou dost now essay] If thou atchievest what thou dost now essay, As surely thou wilt do—who shall not look On thee with unblamed envy—which to brook Smilingly, shall be thine—i' the glorious day Of thy consummate victory!—those grown grey Beneath the rain of honours—those who shook The nations with their conquering arms, and took Cities i' the pale hour of their first dismay; Even those who lift a new-anointed brow, Pressed by the recent ancestorial crown!— And those whom Heaven's rich grace doth will to endow With gifts, with powers, from living founts poured down, Shall haste to celebrate, and joy to avow Their homage and thy triumph's palmed renown! TO THE SAME. [May more than all of Honour, Power, or Fame] May more than all of Honour, Power, or Fame, Be now thy portion—if with tempered zeal And Heart taxed to its pulses' height to feel The importance of the object—thou the flame Of high Truth kindlest—and thy righteous aim, With hope unblenched, dost compass—Man's true weal It may be thine to stablish and to seal! What may'st not thou of good and guerdon claim? Oh! who that in such sacred enterprize E'er caught one glorious glimpse of Heavenly things, And with high-thoughted hope soared up the skies, Could stoop to thirst for Earth's low troubled springs,— All grandeur in their Mind's proud circle lies— Empire is in their Soul's unshackled wings! TO THE SAME. [Religion's union with the great—the deep] Religion's union with the great—the deep Philosophy, shall be high good for man; And well for thee 'twill be to tower i' the van Of such fair blest atchievement: thou shalt reap, For thy sublime exploit, that which shall steep Thy Soul in lofty joy—the mighty clan Of Philosophic Spirits—from the ban Of Heterodoxy freed—shall then to the heap Of their rich treasures, add the richest far, And as in Knowledge, in Devotion thine, The Astronomer shall consecrate each Star To its Creator's glory, and the mine Of wealth that the laborious chemists dare To explore, shall prompt and raise, true thoughts of Power Divine! ON THE SAME. [Thy path, thy purpose, are as noonday clear] Thy path, thy purpose, are as noonday clear; Pause not nor falter on thy radiant way, But work with strenuous ardour day by day. Thy task shall be one triumph!—task how dear— How great—how glorious!—e'en to make appear, In heightened Majesty's august array, The Eternal Power Supreme! Go not astray From thy proud course, but dauntless onwards steer!— “Let there be Light,” pronounced the Almighty Sire, And Light in Glory's full-blown pride was made! But He in mystery bright willed to retire!— Creator! deign'st thou part that dazzling shade— Deigns't thou the creature's trembling voice inspire?— He saith—“Lo! Light of Light!”—and thou shin'st forth displayed! THE BACKWARD SPRING. The moments round us now should break In showers of sudden stars and bright; For Spring the beautiful is here— The Seasons' pride—the Year's delight. But Winter, in unchanging gloom, Seems frowning in expiring wrath, And casting loweringly around Dim funeral shadows o'er her path! Yet the brave birds her presence feel, Nor fear the expiring tyrant's threat, Then bid her welcome to the World, Nor one soft note of cheer forget! The flowers, too, frailest things, and meek, To lift their heads of beauty dare, And yield their delicate delight— E'en to this chill forbidding air. Here the pale primroses spread out Their simple charms, to please the sight, And there the violet's purple pride Touches with richer tints the light. All things are true to thee, Oh! Spring, Though not yet art thou true to them: Haste, haste! or all thy votive flowers Will fade untimely on the stem! The moments round us now should break In showers of sudden stars—young joys Should now accompany our steps; But thy delay our hope destroys! Fear'st thou, Oh! balmy-breathing Spring, The expiring tyrant's rugged rage? Smile—and thy grace of youth shall soothe The intemperate fury of his age! Thou, like some sweet, but weakling child, Totterest three paces forward now, And now shrinkest those three paces back, Veiling thy rosy cherub brow. Thy lovely frowardness or fear, Thy weakness or unwillingness, But make us fondly love thee more— More prize what we may not possess! SONNET. [I journeyed on, and journeyed with the Storm] I journeyed on, and journeyed with the Storm, The unruffled Waterfalls fresh beauty gained, Fast in the fetters of the frost enchained, They charmed with many a wild fantastic form, Lacing the steeps with Beauty!—Soft and warm The Moon's pale fire seemed, as she smiling reigned O'er icy regions!—the smooth Snow unstained Fell noiseless round—the flakes with their white swarm Covered all objects—'twas as though the rays Of that clear moon fell from Heaven's distant height, And showered themselves in pearly rains!—the gaze Surprising with profound and full delight— Soft the Snows made the Mountains rugged ways, And pure the Scene unto the gladdened sight! SONNET. [I had passed through the ample plains, where Nature wears] I had passed through the ample plains, where Nature wears An aspect most monotonous—to be More charmed, when from one steep acclivity, Proud Genoa, with her crown of towers, and tiers Of palaced dwellings, was descried—she rears Her brow of royal Beauty gloriously O'er the blue Ocean—whose bright waves and free Glass back that beauty, which thus more appears! All had seemed bare and wintry to my sight Till that glad moment! Winter seemed to flee From that bright Ocean, clad in purple light, With its yet bluer lovelier canopy. Broad on my gaze, from that triumphal height, The sunny South, at once, burst, with her sunny Sea! THE SUNBEAM. Sunbeam! that gloriously Shineth victoriously Over the mountain and over the mead, Oh! how thou brightenest there, Oh! how thou heightenest fair, All that is lovely and gladsome indeed. Sunbeam, beguiling still, How shin'st thou, smiling still, Over the temple and over the tomb, To the waste's frowning place, Lending thy crowning grace, Making all barrenness beauteous as bloom! Sunbeam! that showeringly Sheddest o'erpoweringly Thy streaming smiles o'er the lit lustrous sea— Here—why refuse to shine, With thy rich hues to line This weary Soul—that still sunless must be! THOSE WHO LOVE NOT. Those who love not can never know Nor dream what Heaven is like below— And therefore, those that love not, ne'er True zeal for higher things can share— Nor can they care in earnest mood For good and guerdon of that good— That know not what in truth may be Perfection and felicity! Oh! they can surely little care, In this dull world so bleak and bare— For that which ever unto them Remains unknown, as pearly gem To coasts of ice, or golden grain Unto the desert's savage plain— Or Summer's rich and orient rose Unto the Winter's pallid snows! Oh! those who love not—they in vain Shall seek to tread in Hope's bright train— Their life is a disjointed tale, Their worth is waste—their weal is wail! Their wealth is want—their work is wrack, Whate'er they gain, yet more they lack. Their wisdom is but weakness still— Their best of good is worst of ill! Strength, Light, Truth, Bliss, Power, Knowledge, Worth— These spring alone profoundly forth From Love—the mighty and the true, That doth Creation's youth renew! 'Tis he alone on Earth below, Can teach us what Heaven is to know!— Oh! Human Love!—how strong thou art Avoucheth many a feeling heart! THE SOUL'S UNREST. Low-thoughted Fears, high-thoughted Hopes contend Within my heart, that may not—cannot blend— And I am slave and victim to them all, And seek not freedom from this fatal thrall! Oh! he that rides on the tumultuous surge, When tempests toss his bark, and swift winds urge, Is on a bed of peace with him compared, In toils of Fear, and thralls of Hope ensnared! He makes his torn and wildly troubled life One scene of silent, but of savage strife— The rosy sun-beams slanting through the storm, But serve to show the threatening danger's form! Those threatenings of to-morrow frowning throw O'er light dreams of to-day stern shades of woe; And when Hope shines the brightest, Fear, dark Fear Then ever seems most terrible—and near! For Hope brings Fear as yon fair Evening Star Brings the dull Night, o'ersweeping wide and far! To Hope—to Fear—I now would bid farewell— And with Repose—if in the grave—would dwell! O'ER VINEYARD GROUNDS. O'er vineyard grounds and orchard-plains Strange shadow-breadths are thrown; And a gloom hangs o'er this golden land— A dull gloom—not its own! 'Tis as some cloud—some gentle cloud From England's shadowy skies— Had followed like a tame thing here, To charm the wanderer's eyes! The golden sunshine brightly laughed, And won with roseate blaze— Warm Admiration's lightning glance, This claims a tearful gaze! The tears of Love, the sighs of Thought, This gentle gloom claims now; The shadow on the sky hath flung Its shadow o'er my brow! Oh, Love! thy tears, thy clouds, thy shades, Are, to my Soul, more dear Than Beauty of a perfect joy, Without a touch of fear! Soft cloudy Gloom awhile remain, And speak to me of Home; I praise these gold Skies' orient blaze, But love their tenderer gloom! O'er vineyard-grounds and orchard-plains Dim shadow-breadths!—brood still!— Memory can make ye more than bright With her transforming skill! The beechen grove—the oaken wood— Start up—before my eyes!— Delay but yet a little while, Dim Cloud, in these fair Skies! Home-scenes, the dearest of the dear, May spread before my gaze, While thou shroud'st up thus graciously, This stranger-Sun's proud blaze! Naples. ALAS! WHY ART THOU FAR? Alas! Why art thou far away— Why art thou far from me? My Heart sinks crushed e'en Day by Day By faint despondency! My very thought—the free—the wild— For ever on the wing!— O'erworn with its vain restlessness, Faints like a wearied thing! That thought o'er mount o'er main still flies, To find thy distant place; And still its pilgrimage renews— Repeats the hopeless chase! Alas! why art thou far away, Why art thou far from me?— While I but have one wish on Earth, To live for only thee! My thoughts the truant's part still play— I walk as in a cloud, Amidst the Shadows of vain Dreams, By reason disavowed. All that makes this life beautiful, Alas! is gone with thee; All that is bitterness and bale Remains behind with me! I dwell in trembling silence here— Still trembling Night and Day; My Being and my Destiny, These, these seem far away. I dwell in trembling silence here, Unknowing mine own fate, And feeling but this heavy truth That I am desolate! Oh! what on Earth may be compared To tortures of this woe?— The fate I mourn unceasingly, I may not fully know. To watch, wait, dream, doubt, fear, suspect, Torn by distracting care, For certainty to sigh in vain, Ev'n though it brought despair! Such is my fate, and such 'twill be While thou art far away— While grows the burthen of its gloom, Yet heavier, day by day. Haply thou'rt thinking now of me, Or never think'st at all— I know not that which even now is, Nor that which may befall! SONNET. [With a slight groaning noise the sledge passed on] With a slight groaning noise the sledge passed on, O'er the new fall'n and lightly-crumbling Snow— Faint Echoes trembling rose above—below— Sole Sounds that shocked Night's silence on her throne Of many Mountains there!—the bright Moon shone O'er rugged steeps—and silvered o'er the brow Of many a Giant precipice, while slow Her gentle sway seemed perfected, stamped—won! My Soul a deep majestic joy confessed— Though scarce might I resolve from whence it sprung— Nor whether pleased, and soothed, and charmed me best, The nearer sounds—or distant silence, flung, Like a broad mantle North, South, East, and West, While Nature's mighty Lyre seem'd for a time unstrung! THE LAND OF BEAUTY. Oh! Land of Beauty's sunniest boast! My Heart now greets thee well; Fame, with her twice ten thousand tongues, But ill thy charms could tell! The Cactus and the Aloe here Please the unaccustomed eye; Th' Olive and Orange Trees pronounce Thy praises, southern Sky! The Myrtles and the Mulberry Trees Their gentle Shade bestow! Look on the Earth to know how bright A Sun above must glow! That very Earth appears to emit Broad beams of living light, Its surface is so glowing-ripe, So dazzling and so bright! And as, in its own self it were One Orb of glorious blaze, It seems to pour divinely forth, This wealth of glittering rays! Land of the South, and of the Sun, Thou know'st not dearth nor gloom— One garden, and one galaxy, Of brightness and of bloom! Not so—a thousand Ruins raise Their heads in sad reply, And eloquent with mute reproach, Blame the too garish sky. And yet these ruins are themselves, With growths luxuriant girt, And thy soft climate doth from these Destruction's stroke avert! Italia! Ah! not half so fair, Wert thou without their gloom, We love thee more for their proud sake, Land of the Eternal Rome! SONNET ON GALILEO. (SUGGESTED BY HIS MONUMENT IN THE CHURCH OF SANTA CROCE.) Methinks I see thee now, Great Sage! who wrought Sublimely—thou!—made the infant Truth's grey nurse! O'er-canopying the outstretched universe With one magnificent and sovereign Thought!— Methinks I see thee (who long since wert brought To this stern spot—stretched on thy sage's hearse!) Unshaken, while scorn, blame, and shame, and worse Were showered upon thee, who Truth's fulness taught!— A heavenly Soul was thine, whose flight was far Above the tenour of terrestrial things, Whose comrades were undying Sun and Star!— Clustered with constellated eyes, her wings, (Like as the wings of Cherubim even are!—) Flashed surely!—and she reached, pierced—tasted Truth's clear springs! THE MAIDEN'S SONG OF SORROW. “Dark, dark Roncesvalles! stern battle-ground hear, Give a voice a low voice from thy stillness so drear, How sleeps he, my lost one, the true and the brave, 'Mid your silence and shadows, dread place of the grave. “Oh! dark Roncesvalles, to Fancy's sad eye, Thou seem'st but a place where Love's true heart must die, A haunt of sick fear, and a scene of dim gloom, A field of dull mourning—a vault and a tomb. “The stars there with cold funeral splendours must shine, The clouds hang like palls o'er that dread field of thine, And the deep tempest-anthems rise awful and loud, O'er your pines, Roncesvalles, a stern spectral crowd. “Dark, dark Roncesvalles! give voice from the dust— How sleeps he—the joy of my Soul and its trust?— His blood made you hateful—his dust makes you dear! Dark, dark Roncesvalles!—thou distant and drear! “Give reply to the voice of my passion's despair— Doth his phantom e'er rise on your night-clouded air? Oh! would I could live where his scattered dust lies, Till my Soul may join his in the blessed bright skies!” Thus murmured the maiden whose lover afar, Had fallen in the shock and the tempest of war; But no answer was rendered—vain, vain was her wail, Since her lover lay mute—Oh! what voice might avail? THE VOICE OF WAVES. The dreamy warble of the blue bright wave, That slowly-gathered—gently comes to lave The yellow beach—Oh! how its music seems To girdle me around with Slumber's dreams, Though not with Slumber's self—how soft—how dear Those low delicious murmurs to the ear! Still rolling shorewards with melodious sigh, Wave after wave comes slowly on—to die! It is a swan-like music—for they break On the smooth beach, and sleep no more to wake! That dying sound just swells upon the air, And then gives place to a fresh murmur there; Those shell-like sounds—that swan-like music now Stamps the pale seal of thought on this chill brow! My Soul dies off still with the dying wave, No passion-gust doth o'er its surface rave, But Peace—a thoughtful Peace—yet a serene, Now makes it tranquil as this watery scene! The rise and fall of Feeling's music deep, Within its depth seems perfect time to keep, E'en with the rise and fall of these sweet waves, Whose shivered chrystal their broad margin paves! How moisten they the sea-weed wreaths that lie Upon the beach—before all black and dry— And turn—and turn them ever in their flow, And curl and fret them as they onwards go. Ocean! thou seem'st upon thyself to brood, In placid calm, and yet in playful mood! Who could now recognize in thee the Power That spreads destruction in his wrath's wild hour? That scattereth navies like these scattered weeds, While rise the shrieks of death he never heeds— But overpowers with his own thunder-cries, Shouting defiance to the shaken skies! SONNET. ['Twas a fair sight!—great Genoa like a Queen] 'Twas a fair sight!—great Genoa like a Queen, In towery domination, o'er the sea Rose beautiful; while tossing in proud glee, There crowded vessels crowned the watery scene! Afar all sparkling bright with marble's sheen— White villas clustered—and appeared to be Earth-meteors glimpsed through clouds resplendently, Set in their sombre frames of cypress green— Above me spreads a Paradise of Sky Smooth as a glass—and on its broad expanse I almost looked with fond expectancy— (Rapt in a dreamy pleasurable trance), Hoping to see th' Earth mirrored to mine eye As that was on the glittering Sea perchance! THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME. SONNET. How clear the azure of the Roman air, How tenderly transparent and how clear! All groweth beauteous in this atmosphere!— All doth the crown of its pure glory wear, Cypress and aqueduct, and temple fair— Their forms of loveliness triumphant rear— Dear to the sense and to the feeling dear, And win a softened charm peculiar there! And were those ruins and those trees away, Nor cypress left, nor aqueduct to adorn The fair Campagna—still each golden ray Of this rich Roman Sun in Eve or Morn, Should stream with beauty—and by Night and Day, The Horizon and the Heavens gleam fair,—of pride unshorn! I THINK OF THEE. I think of Thee!—I dream of Thee!— Mine only love! for ever— The mountains and rolling sea, Oh! these are vain to sever! To every thought of Thee I cling, Which Memory's truth is giving— Like drowning wretches—perishing, To any hope of living! And as those thoughts are dark or bright, My fate seems fair or frowning; No sway but thine—Morn, Noon, and Night My constant Soul is owning. I think of thee!—I dream of Thee!— Mine only love! for ever— The mountains and the main must be Vain, vain indeed to sever! HUMAN LIFE. Life! we do wrong, when we at times affect To blacken thee with scoff of disrespect, And o'er all universal life to throw The shadowy mantle of our proper woe! And who is there that ever yet was born, That hath not with unwise rash reckless scorn, Rejected some fair proffered happiness— Where with indulgent Heaven, his Soul would bless, And clung to some chimæra, weak and vain, Only because 'twas gendered by his brain! Far less of joy containing—less of bliss, Still chosen, cherished, clung to, but for this; But for the senseless and the stubborn sake, Of that proud Will, which doth not deign to take Blessings as they are offered—and displayed Before the Soul, whose weak election's made!— Blessings poured round with an unsparing hand, No! 'twould its own vain phantasies command! Alas! how oft is this the truth, how oft We ask of distant severed worlds to waft That Happiness which still is at our side, Knocking at our closed hearts of sullen pride, And asking for admittance, but in vain, We chase her thence, then impiously complain! Such happiness must be rejected still, If not the happiness of stubborn Will, Our tyrant taskmaster, that bars repose, And grinds us to the dust with cares and woes, And thus we court some vain and aëry dream, Some unsubstantial and fantastic scheme; While Heaven-sent happiness dwells hovering near, A lovely suppliant, scorned too rashly here, Refused, rejected, with her priceless stores, Though gently knocking at our very doors, Imploring for admittance—but in vain; While still we chase her thence, and still complain. The brain-born mockery of our cherished scheme, The shadowy triumph of our favourite dream, Which we so fondly to our hearts would clasp, Slips from our hold, and slides from our foiled grasp— And then, how long and bitterly we rail 'Gainst Life and Fate, and do affect to scale Their heights, and sound their depths, and then to show That all is falsehood, hopelessness, and woe, That all is useless toil and vainest care, All—doubt and disappointment and despair. Oh! 'tis a false, false part we dare to play, And all is false we do or think or say; First we deceive ourselves, and then we try To mislead others as deceitfully. Should we not rather seek,—through mercy spared,— To warn the rest from dangers we have dared, To own—Oh! Life! how we have wronged thee still, And to confess ourselves of thy worst ill The senseless Authors—stubborn, weak, and vain, The fools of our own over-working brain, That miscreates Creation—and doth spread O'er all things one night-shadow, dark and dread, And in itself a Chaos—makes appear All else a Chaos-waste of Fate and Fear. Yes! let us give the experience we have earned, And let us teach the lessons we have learned, To our poor faultering Brethren of the dust, And be to Life, and these, our Brethren, just! Haply in this good work engaged, no more The sport of wayward fancies as before, Still, seeking others' Happiness to ensure, Their bliss to frame, their triumph to secure, We may learn things we ne'er before have known, Opening our long sealed bosoms to our own! THE ANGEL-SWEETNESS OF THY SMILE. The Angel-sweetness of thy sunny smile. Can lift my heart from care, with witching wile, The tone of thy soft voice, so deeply dear, Can chase stern Grief, or make it blest appear. If in thy presence pure, pale Grief may come, E'en she reflects thy Soul's immortal bloom, As e'en a cloud that near the Sun remains, Wears his bright fetters and his golden chains. Thy soaring Soul seems beautiful and bright, With morning hues of loveliness and light, In the earliest bloom of purity and peace, Oh! may that bloom ne'er fade, that charm ne'er cease. In thy serenest presence, bright and fair, My Soul seems circled with a purer air, Not Grief—that tamer of the heart! alone, But Sin—but Evil seem its sway to own. COME TO ME. Come to me—come to me—sorrow hath seized me, Shall I not sink in the long weary race, All that once soothed me best, all that once pleased me, Now must to gloom and despondence give place. Haste thee here!—haste thee here!—true one and dearest, One, one smile of thine shall chase shadows and night, Oh! my Soul! all thou doubtest and mournest and fearest, Full soon should be changed then to hope and delight! Haste thee here!—Come to me!—weary with watching, Love in my Soul seems fast fading to grief; The roses that Hope once enraptured was snatching, Display all their thorns stripped of blossom and leaf! Come to me, come to me, like one awaking From dark dreams of suffering and visions of gloom; How should this wrung Heart now wounded and breaking, Start then from the shadows and terrors of doom! Haste thee here!—haste thee here!—Fair Suns are shining! Those fair Suns are shining but vainly for me; Still wrapp'd in a shadow of doubt and repining, I think but of thy smiles, I breathe but for thee! Haste thee here!—Come to me!—Faint e'en with loving, My spirit needs strength now to stand 'gainst this strife; If the needle be fixed—should the Pole Star be roving?— Oh! thee, and thee only, thy Soul seeks in life! SONNET. [Great, World of Nature and of Human Life!] Great, World of Nature and of Human Life! A two-fold World, indeed!—one uniform And most harmonious!—and a self-lashed Storm The other!—preying on increase of strife, With every growth, of every discord rife! Where shapes of shadowy terror ever swarm! Where Passion's Sun strokes—shine to scorch, not warm, And Destiny digs Heart-deep with edged knife, And Selfishness and Malice darkly plot Together, and a hideous council call To effect their deadly ends, repenting not Till each is as the Enemy of all! Nature! thy world seems glorious—without blot, Compared with that where still, Hate's serpent-demons crawl! BUT LET ME LOOK ON THEE. But let me look on thee and live! For now I perish and I pine; And all that life hath left, would give To meet that deep dark eye of thine! I dream, I hope, I ask no more— Yet seems it much to crave of Fate, So utterly do I adore, And I have been so desolate! Oh! let me look on thee and live, Forgetting tortures long, and lone, With Hope and Fear I wildly strive, Upon a sea of troubles thrown! I languish for one long, long look, As prisoned wretches pant for air, Or hunted Hart for woodland brook, Or Exile for his birth-place fair! Oh! let me look on thee and live!— Grant this, and I no more shall droop; It is not much for thee to give, 'Tis all that I can ask or hope! The face of Nature seemeth changed, The face of Man, too, seems to be Grown strange to me—who feel estranged From every thing but thoughts of thee! Oh! let me look on thee and live! Then all this suffering shall be o'er; It is not much for thee to give 'Tis all I dream of Joy, and more! THE FALSE-HEARTED. Oh! what—what shall thy doom yet be, Frail and false-hearted?— Full heavily and long for thee One true breast smarted! Thy doom shall be to know Love's bliss Never—Ah! never! To plunge thee deep in Doubt's abyss, Ever and ever! Love's bright ascents and steps of Joy Shall shine above thee; First hope to wake—then Hope destroy— None, none shall love thee! E'en such shall thy dark doom yet be, Foul and false-hearted— Then thou'lt go mourning heavily For the departed. MANUAL TO INEZ. FROM A MS. POEM. And art thou false?—then where, Oh! where Shall I e'er place again my trust? Have I cast anchor in the air?— And have I reared mine Ark, of dust? And art thou false?—'twere no surprise To me whose trust on naught may rest, To see yon Sun inconstant rise To-morrow in the startled West! And no surprise to me 'twould be To see the sweeping rivers turn Their course from the expectant sea, And climb back to their mountain-urn. And no surprise to me, alas! Who toss upon doubt's wildest wave, To see when, Autumn's glories pass, The young Spring start from out her grave! I can but be astonished now To trace firm Constancy in aught— For thou dost break the deepest vow, That e'er tongue pledged—or passion thought! MEMORIES. Dear Memories! sweet might blowing flowers maintain, In my hushed spirit, your most gentle reign— And ever ripen into glowing dreams, For then the past-time brightly present seems,— Charm me and cheat me as ye will, whilst I Exchange all hope for shadowy Memory! The Past at least is changeless, there at least The restless flow of time and tide has ceased— Whatever was, remains for ever there! Its love must yet be love—its care still care— Its constancy unchanged—its bliss unchecked, Its truth unblasted—and its good unwrecked; Then back, my breaking heart, unto the Past. While Memory lives—its lovely sway must last. Come to my Soul—deep thoughts of other days, And shut out all beside from its fixed gaze— Old thoughts that hang and hang about the heart, Leaves on a hollow stem, that ne'er depart— But have a Life and Being of your own, And fixed remain—though rudely stirr'd and blown, I'the face of all Life's rough inclement winds, Bound by some tie that close, and closer binds, Remain for ever there!—till Death shall come And call the weary and the lorn one home. Such thoughts as these still ward despair's fell blow, And 'mind us thus all is not ill below; A freshness o'er life's feverish hours they bring, And keep the Soul a quick and buoyant thing!— They bid Life's worst and wintriest gloom depart, And form a green Arcadia for the Heart— The green Arcadia of the Heart are they, 'Tis shaded there, through fierce Life's scorching day! HEARKEN TO ME. FROM “INEZ,” A MS. POEM. Hearken to me before I die, Oh! thou too treacherous—but too dear— Hear but my Heart's impassioned cry, Hear!—hear!—for shame or pity, hear! I love thee with so deep a love, Thy harsh unkindness is in vain Its truth and passion to remove, Though that hath pierced through heart and brain! How can I waste my Soul on thee, From whom but cold neglect I meet?— How can I thus devoted be, Spurn'd, harshly spurn'd, e'en from thy feet? How can I dream through Night and Day, Of one whose heart forgets me still; And struggling on my darkened way, Bless the stern cause of all mine ill? How can I turn from every scene, Where peace and gladness seem to smile On one most Fear-like Hope to lean In tremblings and in tears the while? All, all is answered—but too well— Oh! could thy Heart this answer move— Two little words the whole truth tell, Two little loveliest words—“I love!” SONNET. ['Twas in the night I journeyed—moonlight—snow—] 'Twas in the night I journeyed—moonlight—snow— And silence were around!—that scene so still Seemed the hushed heart with awe-touched peace to fill! The hidden vallies shrouded lay below In gloom impenetrable, while the brow— The uplifted brow of every soaring hill Shone out distinctly, clearly visible— Crowned with a diadem of sheeny show! It was as though on every mountain's height A beacon of white fire all keen and clear Was kindled by that pure Moon fair and bright, Who as a silvery Sun did then appear— Making one beauty of the slumberer—Night! While those white beaconed hills did their lit foreheads rear. MY SOUL IS WITH THEE. My Soul is with thee!—dost thou own A mystic presence near— Then most when most, thou art alone, And is that presence dear? My Soul is with thee!—wheresoe'er Thy steps are turned or stayed— My Soul is surely with thee there, In Sunshine's smile or shade! From time to time I ask one thought Of thine—on me to fall! And, Oh! shall deem that lightly bought With my Soul's treasure all! SUNSHINE THROUGH FOLIAGE. Sun! gazing towards thee through these quivering leaves, Whose shadowy green a cloud of beauty weaves, Thou seem'st unto the dreamy dubious eye (Uplooking in a trance of phantasy) A constellation of soft Stars and pale, Sparkling through that light-waved and trembling veil— Or of fine fairy lightnings—quick and keen— But traced imperfectly, and dimly seen! So dense and deep the curtain interposed 'Twixt us and thee, and round us drawn and closed— Thus too thou'rt beautiful; but who could dream, Watching this varying sheen, this softened gleam, That thou art he who rules in light on high— Who fires the East with glory dazzlingly! Who makes the West one crimson world of flame, And wraps in splendour all Creation's frame? Seen through these leaves' wrought shrouds and stems' crossed bars!— Thou'rt like some constellation of soft Stars! The Mighty and the Beautiful may be Despoiled of their most proud transcendancy— Yet still are Beautiful unto the end!— Nor with unworthy image deign to blend, And still are Mighty—nor the bright spell break, Whatever guise they wear, or form they take— Thou glorious Sun!—no less canst thou appear Than constellated Stars—the fair, the clear! Or sudden flashing lightnings pure and bright— Bright with the lustres of a lambent light!— Howe'er thy pomp be 'minished or obscured, It must endure as it hath still endured! It still must pomp and still must triumph be, However different, haply in degree! GIVE ME A PLACE WITHIN THY HEART! Give me a place within thy heart, Who own Love's deep controul— Give me therein a place and part, If thou deniest the whole! Then will I bear as best I may The sorrows of my lot— And bless thee ever night and day, Bless thee—and blame thee not! Nay! I will ne'er of sorrows deem, But court a dear content; I'll wear the yoke of my fond dream— But wear that yoke unbent! Choose whom thou may'st—love whom thou wilt, But grant kind thoughts to me; Mine be the blame then—mine the guilt, If I fare mournfully! I have tamed down my haughty mind That once no power could tame; And meekly am I now resigned To endure a rival's claim! The slightest marks thou deign'st to give Of favour and regard, On those submissive will I live, Nor call my fortune hard! Most thankfully will I receive Thy kindness' slightest boon; Welcome to me still, Love, believe, As showers to Summer's noon! Whate'er thou giv'st that will I take, My scornful pride hath past; And if my foolish Heart should break, The blame on me be cast! No more this burning brow is flushed, My jealous rage hath fled; And if my Soul sinks bowed and crushed, The guilt be on my head! No blame, no fault with thee shall rest, Howe'er it may befall; If I am tortured and oppressed, 'Tis mine own folly all! Whate'er thou dost must still be right, And I dare not repine; I bow to Love's o'erpowering might, And his strong sway is thine! Choose whom thou may'st—love whom thou wilt, But spare kind thoughts for me; Mine be the blame, and mine the guilt, If I fare mournfully. I have tamed down the haughtiest Heart That e'er owned Love's controul; Give me in thine a place—a part, If thou deniest the whole! And I with that will be content, And boast my wealth's great store, Be thankful for the treasure lent, And ask and wish no more! I that of old, with boastful pride, Thought all too small a part; Oh! think how torture must have tried This quick and burning heart! My day of pride, indeed, is o'er— My haughty claims have ceased; But do I not deserve the more, Thus thankful for the least? I HEARD MY DOOM. I heard my Doom—I felt it too— My heart within me died; A thousand daggers pierced it through, All comfort seemed denied! I writhed in torture unexpress'd, And still I writhe the same; A frozen chill is in my breast, Yet in my brain a flame! Breathless with mastering agony I scarce can speak or weep; My troubled thoughts seem rushing by Like clouds in crowded heap! Vague, wild, and dim, and undefined, A fearful race they run! Myriads are sweeping through my mind, But all are full of One! I heard my doom—I felt it too— And bent before the blow; Mine own Heart from that instant grew My worst and deadliest foe! THOUGHTS. Thoughts!—winged wanderers—ye that proudly travel Fast and far as Light on your strong quest, Mystery after mystery bent to unravel— Ye that know not or to pause or rest! Dread, and kingly, and illustrious Mysteries! Ye yourselves beyond all others far!— Heaven enfolds your myriad-volumed histories, Published never under Sun and Star! Strong, and fervent, and victorious Founders E'en of all Earth boasts of proud and great— Thoughts!—ye unexpounded bright expounders Of all secrets of throned Time and Fate! Ye! of Life's strange chaos—mightiest quellers! Stars! scarce seen in your own gathered blaze— Suns of Glory!—Earth's Heaven-haunting dwellers— Your linked Light blots out your separate rays! Powers and Thrones—and Victories and Dominions!— Thoughts! ye reign with a surpassing might; Worlds have known the sweep of your dread pinions, That ne'er yet have beamed on mortal sight. Far ye soar into th' enshrouded regions— Nought too high—too far for your free race! Oh! th' unnumbered, th' unimagined legions!— That might crowd even the avenues of space! Still the Invisible and the Immaterial Space, with more than lightning-leap surmount. Thoughts! ye children of the Soul, etherial, Fiery spray of Being's ocean-fount! Lo! how sweep ye, dauntless and victorious, E'en where nought but ye might dare to move— Proudly piercing with a yearning glorious, Thus to depths beneath or heights above! What is there of glorious in Creation, That ye seize not—make not all your own? In your majesty of exultation, Loosening mighty Nature's gordianed zone! Ye, within the immortal Soul are springing— Wonderous births!—that triumph in your sway! But, far, far from her, how seem ye winging, Past all tracking, your rejoicing way! Nay, not so!—on wings of Morning rising, Borne to realms that never know a bound— Still herself, with bright amaze surprising, There the Soul, as in her sphere, is found! Thoughts! the mighty mother is before ye, Though ye flash with energy untamed; In her stillness e'en doth she outsoar ye— She framed ye!—herself, Heaven, Heaven hath framed! Winged Thoughts, from space to space swift leaping, Ye may boast your wonderous journeyings free; But that Soul, when silent e'en and sleeping, Is herself the Immense—the Infinity! Ye she sends forth, armed with powers transcendant, All to subject to your sovereign sway!— And ye enter on the realms resplendent— Realms and Regions of Eternal Day! And ye pierce through shadowings deep and solemn, Still rejoicing in your splendid toil; Then ye raise the curtain—shake the column— Force the strong holds—seize upon the spoil! Forth ye go in strength, like banded nations; All around ye shall be taught to yield! Heaven's stupendous work of dread Creations Not for ye may prove too wide a field! Forth ye go, like armed and banded nations, Forth—untouched by shadow of a fear, Shaking the Universe on its foundations, Ye and Glory joined in one career. Ye the Soul sends forth, thus armed, victorious, Fired with fervent inspiration's glow, She remaining in herself more glorious Than all worlds that she may seek to know! Gorgeous, Proud, and Beatific Treasures! Thoughts! with all your mysteries and your powers, All your starry and empyreal pleasures, Well the Soul may prize these bright, bright dowers! Ye! that all things claim—and all inherit, Ye, your tasks exultingly fulfil— Oh! ye living lightnings of the Spirit, Myriad-sided—many coloured still! Strong, Triumphant, and Majestic Splendours, Making one bright galaxy of Mind— Nature's fortress to your might surrenders— With the treasures in its holds enshrined! Strange, and Sovereign, and Mysterious Lightnings, Lending Suns of Glory heavenlier rays, Scattering round your colourings and your brightenings, Till the Light is Darkness to your blaze! Crowned, Illustrious, and Mysterious Strengtheners!— Ye!—that mock Zeal's fire and Passion's rage— Ye—Life's labyrinthine lightning-lengtheners!— Brief and swift—yet making the Hour—an Age! LINES FROM A MS. POEM. The World without—the World within was gloom: She sank o'ermastered by that stroke of doom— The World without! There was no World without; Its change, its busy noise, its stirring rout Were passed away from that lorn, wretched one. Creation vanished—she was left alone. The World without!—Ah, that indeed was nought, It lived not to her sense, nor to her thought; Its busy strife and noise disturbed her not, It was too utterly and all forgot. The World without!—for her 'twas past, 'twas done; Aye, 'twas but as a something changed or gone; Between a shadow and a substance then. But oh, the heart's re-action, when again It plunges in the world of beings, shorn Of its best hopes, still lonely, still forlorn! For it doth plunge again—so much the worse; There, there is sorrow's bitterness and curse. Then break the waves in fury, fierce, and dread, Once more about the shipwrecked sufferer's head. Around the barren rock of his repose, Like ruthless murderers and hungry foes,— As they erewhile, around his bark of pride, Then round its wreck rolled roaring far and wide. The first deep hour of a profound despair, Perchance is easier to the heart to bear Than those slow hours, more conscious and more calm, Which bring, alas! no comfort and no balm; But teach the heart, by hateful dull degrees (Which scarce at first the whole dark truth can seize,) All that it hath to suffer and endure, Yet proffer nought of counsel nor of cure. Time may at length our comforter become; But first he helps to strike the stern blow home; And spreads unpityingly, e'en part by part, The map of its despair before the heart. First doth he wake and rouse the half-stunn'd mind, And to the highest pitch its powers upwind— Its powers of passionate suffering—then, but not Till then, may he improve our darkened lot! MY THOUGHTS ARE FOLLOWERS IN THY TRAIN. My thoughts are followers in thy train, Wherever thou may'st go; They hold one calm and constant strain, They keep one changeless flow. My mind's deep Worlds with passion fraught, Know but thy smile—but one! These worlds, of many-coloured thought, Are lit by that sole sun. For this, for these I crave alone, One deep thought, true and kind; If love from thy changed heart hath flown, Should mem'ry leave thy mind? Oh, think of me! yet think of me, Kindly and gently still; If not thy heart, thy memory Mine image long should fill! My thoughts are followers still of thine, Faithful, and firm, and true;— From their first birth they were not mine,— Thy tribute and thy due!— My thoughts are followers in thy train, Winged travellers after thine; They weave a long and burning chain, Whose links round thee entwine. As roll the stars around the sun, As seaward rolls each stream, My thoughts must circle round the One— Be true to the Supreme! ABSENCE AND PRESENCE. How heavily, how wearily These hours of absence move! How gloomily, how drearily, To hearts that deeply love. Yet when thou 'rt near me, mournfully, I faultering speak to thee; Lest thou shouldst look down scornfully Upon my love and me. Yes! tremblingly and tearfully Before thee still I bend; And faulteringly and fearfully, Lest I in aught offend. But still how deeply—burningly Thy presence I implore; How fervently, and yearningly— And love thee more and more! Though tremblingly—though tearfully Thee surely should I greet; And faulteringly, and fearfully, My love's true vows repeat. NEVER THINK I LOVE. Let, let me ever gaze on thee! Nor check me, chide me, nor reprove; Unmoved my mute devotion see, And think not—never think I love. I'll gaze on thee, as pictured saints For ever lift their eyes above; Until my soul with rapture faints;— But never, never think I love. Thus let me listen to each word That from thy gentle lips may flow; That thrills my bosom's inmost chord With mingled fear, and joy, and woe! And at thy side, for evermore, Let me, e'en like thy shadow, move; And deeply, breathlessly adore;— Yet think not, think not that I love! I fear that such a thought should come, And dawn upon thy startled mind! Lest thou shouldst seal my hopeless doom, Lest thou shouldst haply be unkind. It might thy hate, not love, arouse— Thy scorn, and not thy pity move; Hear many another one's rash vows— But never, never think I love. Call it by any other name, And let me dwell beside thee still; And I will shroud the eternal flame, And bend my feelings to my will. Oh! call it what thou wilt, but yet Let me brood o'er the unmeasured bliss: Fate, take from me all else—still let My heart love on—I ask but this. And let me, dear one, by thy side, For ever like thy shadow move— (While I the intense emotion hide)— But never, never think I love. Take my devotions's homage still, Nor blame, nor check it, nor reprove; Call it whate'er may suit thy will,— But never, never call it love! SONG OF THE DYING. Now, now a power seems given to wood and hill, To charm my spirit, and detain it still; The lull of dewy calms unnerves my mind, A voice of love breathes in each leaf enshrined; Beauty round all my paths in smiles seems starting, While I am hence reluctantly departing. There is a purer azure in the air, And in the sky a sunshine yet more fair Than e'er enchanted my rapt gaze before; 'Tis that I soon must look on these no more: Bright Summer at the rose's heart is burning, And I am for my own dark sentence mourning!— 'Tis with bewildered, agonizing gaze I meet the fresh wild Morning's joyous blaze: She comes triumphant over earth and sea, And brings a gift of hope to all but me! I meet her happy singing, but with sighing— All things seem living most while I am dying. Birds, flowers, and streams, how seem'd ye once to bring To me new life!—while every common thing That wore fair Nature's summer-beauty, then Filled me with joy I ne'er may know again: Now I but mark, disconsolate and grieving, This beauty of the world that I am leaving!— Smile on, gay Summer! in your beauty smile, Though not my languid spirits to beguile; Others there are whose hearts sweet Hope yet buoys, That revel gladly in thy glowing joys; For them smile on!—that grave, where I am going, Peace on my soul shall be ere long bestowing. Smile on, gay Summer—smile for others still! Young hearts beat buoyant on the breezy hill; And tearless eyes are gazing on the streams, To see reflected there their own glad dreams— Triumphant in their magical transcendence, The Heaven of e'en that summer Heaven's resplendence. Smile, smile, gay summer, still! and brightly bloom For those yet distant from the engulphing tomb: For me—though fading in my sunny years— I ask no murmuring sighs, I crave no tears: Vain are such tributes of a fruitless mourning, Since to my native Earth no sweet returning! No sweet returning may there be for me! Once launched upon Eternity's dread sea.— Farewell, dear World of beauty and of joy! My love for thee Death only shall destroy. Why should I wish aught living should lament me? One blessing from thy lip, Love! shall content me. THE DEATH OF DAY. Day, like a martyr, dies in flames of fire, To wear a crown of stars, a dazzling wreath On its pale forehead placed, a kingly tire To glorify its proud decline and death. Night, like a mighty mystic mourner seems, And sweeps with thousand shadows o'er earth's face; While melancholy splendours—tearful beams— Seem seeking some lost glory to retrace. ENOUGH, ENOUGH! Enough, enough for me to know That thou art glad and blest! Then though I ne'er may smile in joy! At least in peace I rest. My love hath but one wish on earth— Thy precious happiness; It thinks not of itself at all In its intense excess! Hope never fanned its purest flame With her enchanted wing; Nor Fancy o'er the dream divine A rainbowed light did fling! In truth and singleness I love, And dream of no return. Hope, Hope! methinks, without thy breath The flame doth brightlier burn:— For selfishness and vanity Oft follow in thy train:— I spurn from me all selfish thoughts, And scorn all fancies vain! Oh! Hope ne'er smiled serene on me, My passion to befriend: In hopelessness my love began, In hopelessness to end! Enough, enough for me to know That thou art glad and blest! It matters little from what source,— And matters least the rest! Though I be doomed to lonely lot, (As I must be, I feel!—) I cannot fail in part to share, If I but know—thy weal!— Then, Hope, I ask thee not thy smile, That gilds this life, to lend! In hopelessness my love began, In hopelessness shall end! HAPPY VISIONS. I stood there silently; the brooding air Seemed full of some o'erpowering Presence there; In thought I passed this life's dull narrow bounds, And marked the more than mortal sight and sounds; And as I listened with an awe intense Heard heavenly murmurings with half-heavenly sense, And snatched a thousand visions to my thought, That seemed itself with powers unearthly fraught: All things grew loftier then of earth and time, Then grew mine own existence more sublime:— If this be dreaming, dreams of such rich worth Alone can reconcile to barren earth! But was I dreaming then? Or was't indeed That thou, my soul, from dull, harsh fetters freed, Wert more awakened to the truth of things, More strongly buoyed on thy immortal wings, More full of fervour and of feeling true, Than is thy wont—thus roused to raptures new! Still if I was but dreaming—then oh! then Let me ne'er wake, or never dream again! Fair Visions! ye were lovely as the sky, Flowering with all its stars, to my rapt eye! Ye're vanished; but my soul still pants and heaves, Even with a swell such as the tempest leaves Upon the troubled bosom of the sea, When all but that is in tranquillity! Come back unto that soul, it pants, it burns!— Once more the Vision in its pomp returns: With happy tremours all my heart-strings thrill; With burning hope my pulse seems bounding still. Oh! 'tis too much in such a world as this To dream e'en of such pure and perfect bliss! Depart, ye dazzling Visions! hence! depart! With soaring transports faints my fervent heart; With dear emotions are these eyelids wet. Fly! fly for ever!—yet, ah! fly not yet! ADIEU! THOU GLORIOUS ITALY! Adieu! thou glorious Italy!—I go From thy resplendent skies, whose azure glow Still dazzles with an ever-new delight, A canopy of coloured glory bright! My parting course from thee I sorrowing shape, Land of the orient rose and purple grape! Fair land of the ivy coil and wall-flower wreath, That smile where ruins harshly frown beneath! Land of the laurel and the cypress lorn, (Where one exults the other still should mourn!) Adieu to thee and thine! I bear with me, From thy sweet shores, a world of memory; Of memory full of bright enchantments still, That time shall never change, nor sorrows chill. And yet I leave thee with but little pain; I go to my sweet native air again. Bright land of Picture, Sunshine, Melody, Farewell!—I bear deep memories dear, of thee, Stamped, strongly stamped, within my very heart, Not to decline, oh! never to depart! I bear from thine ambrosial shores with me A little World of Beauty, and of thee, That shall for ever bloom within my mind, Midst all fair thoughts and lovely dreams enshrined. Farewell! thou land of golden Suns and Skies, Spread like enchanted realms before the eyes: Thou Land of Beauty and immortal love, And, oh! of Heaven beneath and Heaven above; The soil we tread on, though of different hue, Seems soft and pure, as yon ethereal blue; Its growths as beauteous as the Stars that line That cloudless blue, and there effulgent shine!— Italia! in thy loveliness supreme, Thou seem'st more fitted for an after-dream, E'en than a present vision! for the soul Surprised by Beauty, scarce takes in the whole: And 'tis a visionary beauty too, Which well, creative fancy, shall renew, And place mid her chief treasures, to outshine All other dazzling splendours of her mine: Touched with the tenderest colours of the heart, Whose hallowed bloom and glow shall ne'er depart. Farewell! thou glorious Italy, farewell! No longer must I mid thy glories dwell; But, oh! for ever shall remember these, When severed by the mountains and the seas. I leave thee to thy purple Heavens of pride, Thine orange-groves, thick-blossomed, deep, and wide; Thy streams of crystal, and thine incense gales, Thy soaring mountains, and thy smiling vales. Farewell, thou loveliest land! for ever fair, Thou soft enchanted clime,—thou roseate air,— Thou golden, golden earth,—thou cloudless sky, Farewell! bright Paradise of Poetry. MANUEL TO INEZ. (FROM A MANUSCRIPT POEM.) I doubt not of thy tenderness, I only doubt thy truth; Thy passion's in its earliest dawn, Thy love in its first youth. Forgive me if thy constancy I wrongfully may doubt; Oh! never was so deep a love, Fear's venomed sting without. Would I might measure thy heart's truth Undoubtingly by mine; My heart and soul, and present time, And future doom are thine. I doubt not of thy tenderness, But doubt thy future truth; Thy passion is but newly-formed, Thy love in its first youth. Oh! that long years already had On this stamped deep their seal, And merged in happy confidence, The torturing fears I feel Though thus to lose so much of life, So much of love, in sooth, Were sorrow to this burning heart, Enough! to know thy truth. And now, with pensiveness and gloom, I falteringly foresee A thousand fever-fits of fear, My portion yet must be. Oh! I shall watch thy love as one Might watch some tender plant, And watching it, with doubt and dread Shall ever trembling pant. If the sun shine upon its stem, 'Twill seem to shine too strong, Or if the rain pour down instead, I still should fear some wrong. 'Twill fill my heart with heaviness, Whatever wind may blow!— For me such sufferings are prepared, I deeply feel and know. Then would that years already had To that sweet plant giv'n strength, So that I might repose in peace, And trust thy love at length. To lose so much of life and love, In dull Oblivion's shade, This were a mighty sacrifice, Yet, would that it were made! One hour of sunny confidence, And fearless faith and trust, Were all my soul durst ask, although The next should see me dust. Then roll, roll on—speed fast, ye years, And give me to my fate! If bright—it cannot come too soon, Though dark—I would not wait! SONNET. [On dread Vesuvius' treacherous soil I stood] On dread Vesuvius' treacherous soil I stood; A thousand years their giant shadows threw Around me there;—the Heaven's delicious blue, A Heaven of Italy, did seem to brood, With something of a melancholy mood, O'er that historic scenery: swiftly flew My thoughts to the olden times, and mournful grew, Hovering o'er old oblivion's frozen flood. Gazing from thence, oh! what a wondrous scene Attracts, astonishes, delights, dismays: There Naples sits, a glorious ocean-queen, Upon her throne of waves and hills—the gaze, Then on the mountain with its threatening mien, Sinks back—and there, for long in gloomy trance delays. STRANGE!—THOUGHTS GLIMPSE THOUGHTS. Strange! Thoughts glimpse Thoughts, through shades, midst darkening glooms; Then see them sink as 'twere in shadowy tombs— Nor farther can their course mysterious trace— Thus lost, as 'twere, e'en in the soul's wide space! Thus Thoughts glimpse Thoughts, in the deep pondering mind,— Thus lose them there, no more to track or find!— Oh! mighty Strangers in our Souls there are, Though in our souls—yet severed wide and far! And those keen, sudden, startling Thoughts just come, To flash their lightning splendours o'er life's gloom, And look like Truth, and Triumph—but to pass, And leave the darkness drearier than it was! NOW MORNING AFTER MORNING DAWNS. Now Morning after Morning dawns, To bring no light to me; The only sunshine that I know, Now smiles in memory. Since thou hast left me to regret, And suffering silent love, I see no beauty in the earth, And nought but clouds above. Night after night comes frowning still, While dreams these eyelids shun; The darkness of a thousand nights, Seems crowded now in one. I have thought o'er, unnumbered times, Each word, each look of thine; Memory grows weary of her task, And fades in fast decline. And sorrow still her shadow throws Round memory's mournful path, And makes her labour dry and dull, Since she its best fruits hath. Oh! each remembered word and look But brings regret and fear; Who, who now dwells beside thee, love To see thee and to hear? I have thought o'er, ten thousand times, Each look and word of thine: Oh! who hath the reality, While but the shadow's mine? Memory and hope, these both must fade, And both are fading fast; But thou—thou rash and fatal love, Thou still unchanged must last! NO BIRD THAT SINGS IN SUMMER'S BOWERS. No bird that sings in summer's bowers Was e'er so light as thou once wert, In thy unblighted, buoyant hours, Oh! my betrayed and broken heart! More and more beautiful appeared The glorious heavens, the glowing earth, When Love his hapless victim neared— How could I doubt his truth and worth? Now Fear around me spreads his shade,— And pierce and thrill with awful power Memory's sweet whispers,—till dismayed My heart is wan as blighted flower. Shall I look forward to that Fear, Or back to Memory's sad delight? Oh! both are deadly, both are dear, In Fancy's and in Feeling's sight! I love the very worst of grief That thou canst on my soul inflict, And feel one hour of kindness brief Would pay for centuries of neglect! Then canst thou have the heart to doom Thine own devoted one to death, And darken all her soul with gloom,— While still she breathes grief's troubled breath! SPEAK TO ME. Speak to me, though with words unkind! Say any thing,—but speak! This vague, dull sorrow, undefined, My fainting heart will break. A change of suffering should appear A happy change to me. Give me regret instead of fear, For doubt give certainty! A change of suffering in mine eyes Were as a blessed thing. My very heart within me dies, Thus piecemeal perishing. It pineth, ever pineth thus, Oppressed with one dim dream: This misery is monotonous In its dull, deep extreme. Speak to me!—though from thy loved lips Ungentle words may flow; They cannot darken more the eclipse Of my profoundest woe! And they may vary, it may be, My thoughts' dull tenour so, And chase the cold monotony, Though not the crushing woe! Others may hope for happiness, And peace and pleasure fair, While I one faultering wish express— A difference of despair! Grant me but only this to know, (Beneath pain's weight, still bent,) A new variety of woe, And I will be content! Take off this burthen from my mind, This burthen from my heart: Methinks I were to aught resigned, With this could I but part. Aye! though a heavier burthen 'twere Then in its stead imposed, Fresh wounds unmurmuring would I bear, So that the old were closed. Fresh wounds, though deadlier, deeper still, I should far better bear; So that I gained my wish and will,— A difference of despair! I am so sickened of this strife, So weary of this woe, Still lengthened with my lengthening life, While both together flow; All other sufferings sure would seem Like dear delights to me, Thus wearied of my wasting dream, And its monotony. Then speak to me!—though still unkind!— Say any thing,—but speak! Let me some cruel difference find, My heart at last may break! Give me, for this dejection deep, A torture quick and keen; My soul in sternest sorrow steep, But change that sorrow's scene. Speak to me!—more and more unkind, If 'tis thy will become; But change this madness of the mind, Decree a different doom. A change of suffering were to me A blessing bright and fair; Grant me some stern variety;— Some difference in despair! THE SORROWS OF ABSENCE. Heavy and hateful absence—I am crushed Beneath the gloom of your detested weight; No fount of peace, to slake my thirst, hath gushed, Since death-like absence first eclipsed my fate. There seems to be a world 'twixt thee and me,— Immensity between us seems to roll; To me one darkness, one monotony, As 'twere the very Charnel of the Soul. Yet there are many ties between us still; This I repeat, yet scarce believe, the while: Would I could teach this heart with joy to thrill, To think the same blue sky o'er both doth smile. To think the spring, the buoyant blessed spring, Round both is scattering now her rich delight; Hov'ring round both, with soft unfolding wing, Profuse of joy, and glad, and young, and bright. Oh, hateful absence! 'tis in vain I strive To call sweet thoughts unto my cheerless mind; One bitter feeling can disperse, and drive These thoughts away, like leaves before the wind. Harsh, hateful absence! Reason speaks in vain, And fancy vainly strives to soothe my woe; I only feel the torture of thy pain, The weight of thy despair I only know. And still between my soul's adored and me A dark immensity appears to roll; A wide waste world between us seems to be, The very sepulchre of the o'er-worn soul. THE BAY OF NAPLES. How calm these waters, with their glorious hue, Of skiey, pure, and most transparent blue; How lovely mid these lovely scenes—a bath For beauty and her daughters, and a path For fairy shapes, the gentle green-haired throng, Who unto Neptune's joyous courts belong! Fair Bay! how calm and still thou seem'st to be, Mirror of Nature's mutability! And yet thou'rt restless in thy fair self too; I mark the unquiet of the quiv'ring blue, That seems upon the watchful sense to grow, E'en as it watcheth—and the rippling flow Seems to increase and quicken as we gaze, Redoubling ever in the sunshine's blaze; Till almost, mid these glorious scenes, thou art, As 'twere, a moving life—a throbbing heart; A boon, a blessing, and a beauteous scene, Thou surely art, and of bright seas the Queen; A liquid Paradise to those who glide Dreamily o'er thy blue and heaving tide: And like a mighty banner, broad and bright, Unfurled in glory on the admiring sight; Thou seem'st in rich and wavering sheets to lie, Obeying still the faint wind's every sigh! OH, PITY THOSE! Oh, pity those who love too well! Too many pangs they prove; Through life a thousand sorrows dwell With true and fervent love. But when stern Death at last must come, They shrink in faultering fear, Lest that their dark and heavy doom Should grieve their loved ones here! They half survive themselves in woe, Feeling for them, through all— Those deeply dear, for whom the blow Full heavily must fall. Oh, pity those who love too well! Such endless griefs they prove; Through life unnumbered sorrows dwell With true and trembling love. Nor e'en in death those pangs are past, Which wring the loving heart; Oh! human love, how deep,—how vast,— How terrible thou art! STAMPED ON MY MIND. Stamped on my mind is thy dear name, For ever clear and bright; As it were written there in flame, Or characters of light. My thoughts their several musics lend, To that name soft and sweet; Or all their many musics blend, That precious name to greet. The music of their tenderness, The music of their love, The music of their fond distress, In one rich strain these move. But in itself all harmony, All eloquence is heard!— Or so it still appears to me,— That deep melodious word! No music is so deep, so dear, No eloquence so true; It is a Heaven unto mine ear, And to my feeling too. I speak it in a faultering voice, With trembling tones profound; Doth not the very air rejoice, To know its lovely sound? I speak it, and with many a sigh, Again and oft again; And love the echoes that reply To mine own accents then!— It seemeth like some mighty spell, To charm my cares away, My sorrows in their strife to quell, And o'er my soul to sway. But, oh! when I pronounce it not, I hear it still the same; Not for one moment 'tis forgot,— That most beloved name! I hear it breathed in mystic tone, For evermore the same: Hast thou a sweet voice of thine own, Oh! thou beloved name? Thou name of beauty! dear thou art, Beyond all language dear; Still, still I hear it with my heart, And answer with a tear! The voice of birds, the stream's clear sound, The echo faintly heard, The spring-leaves' murmuring sighs profound, Are harsh to that sweet word. The dullest tongue must utter forth That name in music's tone; And, oh! the coldest ear on earth Its thrilling magic own. Yet ever seems it unto me, Whom most it must inspire, That it should only spoken be To sound of thrilling lyre! Yet silvery lyre that soothes the ear Should scarcely worthy be;— Nor ringing crystal,—soft and clear, That name to accompany! Not warbling shell nor dulcet reed Could match with softest tone, That melody, supreme indeed; Then be it breathed alone! All noblest feelings of my soul Its deep enchantment moves; It melts and it inspires the whole, Which well and wildly loves. It moves my soul, it melts my heart, It thrills my trembling frame: Mighty and clarion-like thou art, Thou one beloved name! A sudden trumpet, clear and strong, Is that sweet tone profound; A trumpet to my thoughts, that throng And tremble to the sound. It moves my soul, it melts my heart, It thrills my shivering frame; A trumpet to my thoughts thou art, Oh! thou beloved name! Thy deep, melodious magic wakes Thoughts words may ne'er express! I listen till my bosom aches, With throbbing tenderness! Beloved, oh! beloved, name!— Though breathed in whisper low— How dost thou flush my brow to flame! My heart with passion's glow! New life seems throbbing through my veins When that loved sound I hear; A world of pleasures and of pains Springs from that word too dear. It seems to herald all fair hopes, All loveliest thoughts and dreams, Until this heart, that doubts and droops, Hails joy's new-shining beams! More power—that much-loved name, and most Doth wondrously possess— Than thousand languages can boast, Or ever can express! Oh! were I prisoned in the tomb, In Death's harsh durance bound, Surely that name would pierce the gloom Of that sepulchral ground! Surely that name's dear music must, If uttered near me then, Upwaken e'en my slumbering dust To love and life again. That name's mellifluous magic still Should its strange power retain, And bid life's throbbing pulses thrill Through that cold clay again! Beloved name! whose eloquence Saith all things to my soul, E'en now steal o'er my yearning sense, Softly as first you stole! Steal like a rapture o'er my sense, And through my trembling frame Pour thine enchanted eloquence, Oh! thou beloved name! SONNET. [Earth's dreams away, like troubled vapours, roll] Earth's dreams away, like troubled vapours, roll, From this full solemn hour, in life's wild race I pause, to commune with stern Death, and trace His features in my fancy—and controul Thought's feverish workings. Heart! hear Hope's last knoll; Thou lone church-yard, dark, dedicated place, Where, with a thousand shadows we embrace, One shadow long shall rest upon my soul! To purify, and solemnize, and raise; Nay, e'en to enlighten with its mystic gloom: For we walk darkly in life's blinding blaze; That Heavenly Shadow deeply shall become More precious far than light to my fixed gaze— Lengthening from the other side of yon awaiting tomb! SONNET. [We live, in sooth, a threefold life below] We live, in sooth, a threefold life below; Past, Present, Future claim us for their own, And all their fetters are around us thrown. Memory and Hope, while life's mixed currents flow, Open their Scenes before us, and we know Their influence ever—neither sways alone; But both united!—all our paths are strown With their fair treasures, still of various show. Least of all live we in the Present's hour. We shun it, as 'twere Life's unkindliest clime; Yet Present! thou alone rul'st strong in power: The Past is but a mournful ghost sublime; The Future—promise! Ye are life's threefold dower,— Past, Present, Future—Trinity of Time! SONNET ON NIAGARA. Waters of wonder! whose dread cry, profound, Is as the world's voice lifted to the sky! A wild, and terrible, and awful cry, Fall! pealing with a more than sea-deep sound, Thrills not the earth to thee for leagues around?— Art thou not heard into the Eternity?— Beyond that upper air that seems to lie Listening above thee in bright silence bound? On plumes of swift imagination borne, How have I seen thee, mighty cataract! sent As 'twere from Heaven to Earth, of strength unshorn! How have I o'er thy scene o'erpowering bent, Adored thy wrathful play and savage scorn, Thou won'drous Chaos of one Element! SONNET. [Bright hour and still!—where is the restless heart] Bright hour and still!—where is the restless heart That might not now be won to dreamy rest? This glassy sea reflects on its smooth breast A cloudless sky of glory. Sea! thou art Softened and soothed to peace: from thee depart All memories of old storms—their strife unblest Is past and is forgotten. Oh, 'twere best Life's storms once past, no more should sternly start To mind!—But memory reigns through all our years!— The sea may sleep—the heart reposeth ill! The fevered heart!—this Hour strange beauty wears: The sea seems to resign his own wild will, And like a Lake of Beauty hushed appears, And all the Heaven of Waters lieth still! SONNET. [Near us there is a mighty world unknown] Near us there is a mighty world unknown; Dread, glorious, unimaginably vast: There Present, Future reign, and shadowy Past! The actual, and the coming, and the flown, In power there shadowed forth, are deeply shown:— Treasures are hoarded there, up-piled—held fast, That all the wealth of all earth's kingdoms massed Together should not buy.—Crown, sceptre, throne, Are dross beside their pomp. No living eye Hath e'er looked on that world—none ever will; It is the unbounded ark of the Most High! Those shadows are as Suns its depths that fill, Its thousand parts God's Image multiply! Oh! dread World of Ourselves!—thou'rt veiled, sealed, shrouded still. MY THOUGHTS SPEED O'ER THE RESTLESS WATERS. My thoughts speed o'er the restless billows, Themselves as restless and as wild; Now stirred with a delicious tumult, And now with grief's dark stains defiled. My thoughts are travellers o'er the waters, Themselves as troubled and as deep! The sea reflects a thousand shadows, My thousand thoughts one image keep! My thoughts, are pilgrims o'er the ocean, Themselves as mighty and as strong, The ocean mirrors back the heaven, And all the clouds its realms that throng! My thoughts still mirror thee, O false one! There thou'rt an angel still of light; They evermore reflect their Heaven, But not its clouds, in troubled flight! They mirror back thy bright perfections, And all thy faults—thy follies shun; While by those reckless faults and follies My soul's best hopes are all undone! My thoughts speed o'er the ocean limit, With Night's wild winds in mid career; On land for them is no reposing, Since, O beloved! thou art not here. Then let them speed like sudden lightnings, Should they remain they may not rest; Better that they should flash unshackled, Than smoulder in a darkened breast. But vainly must they toil and travel, Still for leagues on leagues untold; They seek a fond heart and a faithful, They shall but find a false and cold! FORGIVE ME. Forgive me that I bless thee still, While thou doomest me to woe. Alas! Hope's smile, and flush, and thrill, I never more may know! My heart is ashes, and my soul, Crushed by this mortal ill; My thought is as a withered scroll, And yet I bless thee still. Since thou hast ceased to love, perchance, This deep affection's strength, Which speaks in ev'ry word and glance, May rouse thy hate at length! Perchance thou wouldst far rather find A wrathful mood in me; A clouded soul, an altered mind, Than this fidelity. A heart as fickle as thine own, That may no firmness know; And like thine own too cold as stone— I would it might be so! A heart that to the winds should fling Its griefs, from fetters freed, And spread inconstancy's light wing— But crave I this indeed? No! no! far better 'tis to mourn, Victim of heaviest ill, Than thus sink bowed in dark self-scorn— No! let me bless thee still! Despite thy falsehood and thy pride, Thy coldness or thy hate; Oh! faithless one, whate'er betide, I bless thee long and late! Better in lonely grief to weep— In hopeless pangs to pine— Than change this full heart, true and deep, For one as false as thine! Forgive me that I bless thee while Thou doom'st me thus to woe— Alas! Hope's raptured thrill and smile I never more may know! This meek reproach of unchanged love Thou must—thou must forgive— When Passion's power I cease to prove, Know I must cease to live! Forgive me that I bless thee still, While thou doom'st me to woe! I must my faithful part fulfil, As thou thy false—below! SONNET. [To thee, sweet Sleep, do I address my prayer] To thee, sweet Sleep, do I address my prayer, Fair bride of Death! that most tremendous Gloom; Oh! make my couch the shadow of the tomb; But let the phantoms of the past frown there!— To those that love their pain and bless their care, Waftdreams, deep dreams of life:—Iloathe my doom— I ask but Hope—Fear Memory now to o'ercome. Life's pageants are but painted—poisoned air! Crush down, my soul, to stillness—thought by thought! Lie with the monumental marble's weight Upon its swelling strength!—the oppressed, the o'erwrought, May thus be won to peace, e'er yet too late. Sleep! thy dark consort's part be thou now taught; But act it in my Soul!—wrung, pierced by tyrannous Fate! THE CAMPO SANTO, AT NAPLES. Still here, where lovely Nature spreads abroad Her fairest charms, all tread the self-same road— The road to darkness, dust, chill funeral gloom;— All, all still turn their faint steps to the tomb. Strange are the attractions that thus evermore Invest Death's frowning field.—From the bright shore, The purple vineyards, and the flowery plain, The harvest-lands, enriched with golden grain— From the proud warrior's camp—the palace-hall, The cabin-bower, they troop forth, one and all, To take up their abode 'midst those dim shades,— Grey-beards and striplings, matrons, babes, and maids. One from the altar comes, the blush scarce past, From her sweet cheek—one from the heat and haste Of business or contention—some from meed Of merit but fresh won, and some just freed From prison dark, (they seek one darker still, More narrow, and more loathsome, and more chill;) And some from Hope's glad regions, full of light, Ere yet her flowers have bowed beneath the blight, Or her reed-wand is broken!—how can they Forget their homage at her shrine to pay, And go where none in her rich smile rejoice— There, where is no more hope! Ah! strange, dark choice! Some hurry from the revel and the feast, Ere wreaths have died, or melodies have ceased; Some from Affection's happy hearth and home; Some from Earth's solitudes, where free steps roam Unchecked, and Nature's mighty charms expand For the eager wanderers over sea and land:— They asked more space of hill—plain—rolling wave— How can they now find room in thee, thou grave? Some speed, as though with dark, capricious will, From their half-finished works of laboured skill; Some from the toils of student and of sage, The passion-breathing lyre—the pictured page, All from the golden light—the sky—the air, The aspects of their kind—the Earth's face so fair— The glorious world of nature, wide and free, All, all Creation's glorious majesty. What are the fascinations that remain About this spot, which thus attract—enchain— Hundreds of thousands to forsake their all, And lay them down where the earth-worms creep and crawl? What are the charms mysterious that invest This mournful haunt, so dreary and unblest? What the strange, hidden graces that hang round This gloomy piece of flowerless, wormy ground? Answer, ye countless hosts, that hither throng; Ye young, ye old, ye proud, meek, frail, and strong; Wherefore? oh!—wherefore?—but no answer comes From the dark stillness of those sunless homes. A voice in mine own deepest soul replies, “Ask not of Earth the secrets of the Skies.” Worse than all ills that wait on mortal birth, It were to dwell for ever on the earth. But who would,—if 'twere only left indeed To their own choice,—who would from clay be freed? 'Tis well that none may have the fatal choice: They see a shadow, and they hear a voice None other sees or hears, and they depart, Loosening the thousand tendrils of the heart From the heart's precious things, which close around Liannes of Life!—they had fast-wreathing wound! They quit all scenes familiar, fair and dear, And in the solemn haunts of silence drear, They come in cold contentedness to dwell, Exchanging all creation for a cell! SONNET. [He who to that tribunal, deep within] He who to that tribunal, deep within, The court of conscience!—ever trembling turns, Nor its high counsel mocks, its dictate spurns, Doth well indeed—for foul and haggard sin, Close watch'd, doth drop the mask—nor seeks to win His confidence by crafts and sleights:—who learns To make this bright election, never mourns Or change or wrong;—but whoso of the din Of reeking vain opinion, makes alone His guide and key-note, shall most surely rue Disastrous dark vicissitude;—for none Shall find this world's crude, hurried judgments true As his own soul's approval, or its tone Of just reproach, when wrong he stoops to do! SONNET. [Beautiful World! alas! how many look] Beautiful World! alas! how many look On thee, and fail to mark the glorious light Of splendour which invests thee, more than bright; Alas! for them!—their eyes to Nature's book Of Beauty are close seeled. Lo! not a nook— The while that might not surely yield to sight Something to strike, as 'twere, with magic might, Or leaf—or flower—or pebble of clear brook! Bright,—World of Nature!—shines thy rich array!— Oh! but if those who mid life's tumults dwell, Of whom men, in accusing accents, say, “They're wedded to the World!” owned thy bright spell, To thee were wedded—and confessed thy sway, Beautiful World of Nature!—it were well. SONNET ON THE SAME SUBJECT. [We pine for purer, fairer Worlds, nor know] We pine for purer, fairer Worlds, nor know How pure, how fair our own bright World may be! We live too much, poor sons of vanity, In care and tumult, and vain strife below, Nor bask us often in fair Nature's glow; With careless eyes, we half-unconscious see Her glorious, gracious aspect, deep and free, And slight, e'en though we dare not scorn her show! Then we affect a towering discontent, And find fault with the World we fail to mark, And truly in a narrow sphere we're pent, Of selfishness and blindness—deep and dark: But Heaven in elder days its Angels sent, To walk this World—Heaven's King dwelt in it as His Ark. SONNET ON THE SAME SUBJECT. [Bright World of Earth and Air, Sea, Sky, and Sun] Bright World of Earth and Air, Sea, Sky, and Sun, Would I to thee were wedded!—I would be A worldling thus, thus only—proudly free Are they who own such sway; their chains are spun Of light and air—but thy sway let me shun, Harsh, hollow World of vain Society!— Heaven's World!—O! to be wedded unto thee,— And to that glorious Heaven, may be as one!— Aye, this may brightly e'en one meaning bear!— This may indeed be as the self-same thing!— Bright World of Sea and Sky, Sun, Earth, and Air, Let me be wedded all to thee.—Oh! fling Thy flowery chains around me—fine and fair,— For unto thee my heart and soul I bring! SONNET, ON A PICTURE. It is a beauteous face!—and yet it brings Contending thoughts into the pondering mind, The soul in all this loveliness enshrined Hath it kept pure and free its hidden springs? Hath it retained its earth-surmounting wings? Hath it rejected petty chains that bind, And moved still free as sunshine and as wind? Where free it should remain, midst finite things, Not slavishly conforming to the wrong— Where Nature, Faith, and Reason point the right, In high and conscious innocency strong, And guarding well its life from stain and blight. Oh! wherefore ask?—too busy, curious tongue, Let the eye drink awhile, untroubled, its delight. SEAS AND MOUNTAINS. Seas and Mountains are between us, Oh! mine own beloved one; now From each other still they screen us, Lone am I—for far art thou. Oh! the heavy Sea's dark rolling, In my very soul it seems; And beyond my weak controuling, Fills my life with terror-dreams. And these Mountains, oh! these Mountains, Surely on my heart they lie; Crushing down its fiery fountains, To fear's mist of agony! Is't but absence—is't but distance, That this weight of misery brings; That around my changed existence, Such a cloud of suffering flings? Seas and Mountains swell between us, Mountains vast and sweeping seas, From each other still they screen us,— Would there were but these—but these. Other bars more stern, more fearful,— Well I feel divide us now; While I mourn with tremblings tearful, Lorn and lone—since far art thou! Worse than hills and waves divide us,— Me to crush with vain distress; Ye are gone that once allied us— Truth and Faith and Tenderness! Well I know—bleak thought and blighting, Wounding me with grief's excess— Ye our souls are disuniting, Falsehood—Change—Forgetfulness! Not in mine are ye abiding, Heaven forefend!—and Heav'n be praised; That—though weak—fond—blind—confiding, There at least truth's light hath blazed! Not in mine—oh! never, never! Did we wait for that to change— Our fixed souls should never sever, Till through the orbs of light they range! AWAY! Away!—away!— On threatening day— The sweeping storm, With cloudy swarm Of terrors wild, Heaped, thronged, and piled Together high— In the angry sky, And winds that seem, With tempest-dream, (Far swept across—) The earth to toss As 'twere a wave Which foam-wreaths pave! (So doth the strife Give troubled life To all around,) The while the ground, Is strewn with things By those fierce wings, Swept darkly down— The foliage crown Of shadowing bowers, Rained down in showers— Loose boughs and leaves— Till the earth's frame heaves— Roused fancy deems— For so it seems With motion free, Like storm-lashed sea!— Such tempests strong Driven fierce along May raze—may rock, With startling shock. The rose-tree frail In smiling vale— It roots—it rears— The up-shooting spears Of sapling oaks, Whose firmness mocks The threat'ning blast That thunders past!— Roots, roots and rears The straight strong spears— Of sapling oaks— Which bide the strokes Of stormy blast Deep-rooted fast;— Nor shaken there— Proud growths and fair— By shrivelling fears:— Like spears with spears,— The storms they meet, And fearless greet! Like foe with foe, They stand the blow, So bide the brunt, Even front to front: Nor shrink away, On threatening day— From strife and wrath, On their wild path— My Faith so stands!— Fate's treacherous hands May now weave strong A web of wrong; Tumultuous hours, With threatening powers— Of grief and ill, May try it still,— But shall not shake,— Nor teach to quake,— Nor fill with fear!— They root—they rear, That faith sublime, Which fate nor time Shall ever bow— Believe it thou! Dark hours of doom, Of wrath and gloom, May raze and rock, With mastering shock, And teach to quail, Faint faith, and frail— These root,—these rear, Strong faiths and clear, Like mine is still, That fears no ill, Like mine—like mine! Say too—like thine!— A PICTURE. —SONNET. Lady! thou'rt very fair; such forms sweep by On festal nights in gilded palace-halls, With pearls and plumes—yet free from jewell'd thralls, Or e'en the flowery chaplet's tenderer tie!— Spreads streaming loose, like meteors in the sky, That most illustrious hair, which richly falls O'er thy white shoulders—lighting up these walls E'en in its pictured semblance—dazzlingly! Those flower-wreathed chaplets on that queenly brow Should look as proud and glorious as a crown! The jewelled crown upon its cloudless snow Should gain a statelier grace, thus nobly shown! But that illustrious hair's rich splendent flow Than either, or than both, a fairer pride doth own! EVENING. 'Twas Evening!—Music floated on the air, And crimson light was brooding everywhere, And still 'twas growing lovelier; till at last I almost thankful felt when all was past; Too beautiful the emotions that it brought To fascinate the feeling, sense, and thought,— I could not more admire.—My heart and mind, Sank, fainting, pierced by raptures too refined; Each power and faculty seemed on the stretch; I felt a very worm, a helpless wretch, Blind, dumb, unfeeling—even from the excess Of feeling—and o'erpowering happiness,— And half rejoiced when all was o'er at last, And almost thankful felt, when all was past. Oh! our weak nature! we are fettered close (And most we feel it in such hours as those?) In chains too complex, and too mighty still— Narrow our consciousness and frail our will! All things are circumscribed for us, since we Are bound and clenched in our mortality; Our very joys are too much for us here!— We breathless stand, and ask a single tear, To show how much the full-fixed soul adores, Thus borrowing for delight from sorrow's stores. Aye, so our very pleasures give us pain! Lo! we have found the true length of our chain;— And vainly, vainly, 'gainst it strive and strain; So our joys grieve us; so doth our delight With dark self-discontent o'ertake and smite; We are found wanting to ourselves, and own A leaden mantle round our spirits thrown— A frost, like sleep or death, dull, deep, intense, Upbinding every nerve and every sense!— A weight, a chill, a stupor, and a gloom, As though our souls were bound in living tomb;— We find ourselves still wanting evermore Unto ourselves,—and grieve shame-stricken sore, And pine to enter on that nobler life That shall not know this sufferance and this strife— When brightly liberated, proudly freed, Our souls shall grasp their own great bliss indeed!— Not sink beneath its burthen and its weight, But bound exultant, fearless, and elate. There love, joy, admiration, zeal, shall be Part of our living souls eternally;— Not pressing from without—importunate— But part and portion of the soul's estate, No shock, and no addition, and no change, Still there for ever—nothing new—nor strange— Not sprung from foreign objects—to controul, But from the Soul of all things in the Soul! SONNET. [Bring me, oh! pitying Sleep! no lovely train] Bring me, oh! pitying Sleep! no lovely train Of visions fair, no smiling aspects bright, No shapes of beauty, and no realms of light; Bring but forgetfulness!—Steep, steep my brain In that, and I will bless thy gentle chain.— Bring full and deep forgetfulness—and write Upon my soul, in characters of night, One word, one sole word “Peace!”—Come now and reign!— Now come and snatch this heavy heart grief-worn, From all the death of life!—Heave strong, strong bars Between me and that world I loathe—dread—scorn. Dreams—ye're piled battle-fields of finished wars!— Bring me no light to mind of coming morn;— Of night I ask her shadows—not her stars. SONNET. [How many thoughts have travelled through my mind] How many thoughts have travelled through my mind Within this one brief hour, thoughts dark and bright; Soft flowering thoughts, and thoughts of stormy might, And scarce a trace have they now left behind— Gone like a breath of swift and arrowy wind. My soul hath known their darkness and their light; Their tenderer influence and tempestuous flight: And knows no more of them—thus disenshrined, Fled, lost, forgotten—ne'er to be recall'd. Oh! well may all things fleet from us below, Since our own thoughts we may not bind, unthrall'd By our weak will, they to some ocean flow, Those streams of soul—from our sense barr'd and walled— Winged children of the mind! ah! whither do ye go? SONNET. [How do we shape our lives from day to day!] How do we shape our lives from day to day! Here form an interest—there a hope to fill The hours, and here a pleasure, whose sweet thrill May wake the heart-pulse to a livelier play! How do we shape our lives that fleet away!— Our quick thoughts prey on expectation still; The present answereth our desire but ill, Though pleasures—interests may our call obey. The world lives in its future evermore! To-morrow is the idol of us all— And yet though 'tis that future we adore, We care for what may day by day befall. Oh, that on neither we our souls might pour, Another Future—thine, Eternity! doth call! THE STAR'S REFLECTION. Clear the Star shone on the waters, That reflected it in light; With its soft, faint, silvery aspect— Gleaming tremulously bright.— The pale Star shone on the Waters, Like a quivering point of light— And how like a fairy jewel— Its pure glistening chain'd the sight! And was this all?—Star of Beauty— Thou'rt perchance a world sublime— Throng'd with dread and glorious beings— To which thought may scarcely climb. Ah! perchance our own world, faintly— With its Sin, Death, Strife, and Fear— May be thus glassed on pure waters Of some radiant stranger-sphere! SONNET. [And art thou dead, friend of my soul! so long] And art thou dead, friend of my soul! so long Its nearest—dearest—art thou lost and gone? How feel I now on this dark earth alone! For, oh! the ties between us clasped were strong, And thought to thought still lightened—change nor wrong Might come to part us—Death the deed hath done: Of all thy thoughts—remaineth there not one?— Where the ever-moving—many-coloured throng?— Death—Death—strange, fearful mystery that thou art— Infinite mystery—lo! heart, soul, and mind Thou sweepest away at once—they swift depart— No thought—no feeling may be left behind; This Life and Death clash cloud-like—forth doth dart, Soul, thy electric fire at once set free, unshrined! EARTH'S LOFTY SPIRITS. Spirits, thrice crowned!—and lofty and sublime, Surely your lever-thoughts did in their time Lift this world higher in the scale of those Whose circle so mysteriously doth close Around the unseen and the unknown centre still; Centre none hath known—none ever will. These surely did exalt it, in its place!— Ennoble and aggrandize it in space!— And on its forehead seal it with a seal, Which Time may not in all his years reveal, But which, when his swift streams forgets to flow— Lo!—the after-born Eternities may show. Perchance, where in their boundless glory move The orders of bright intelligence above, This world is known by your immortal names, Oh! ye who have built up your stainless fames— Slowly and painfully—midst scorn and wrong, Hate of the few—derision of the throng! Ye, whose illustrious tribulations wrought New epochs in the mighty reign of thought! Your world, crowned spirits—may this earth be styled, Where ye now walk; no more by dust defiled!— Known by your names, and by your glory raised, For those high names' sake it may there be praised! THEY PARTED. They parted in their sorrow, The gentle and the young; But the golden word “to-morrow!”— Sighed from Hope's own honied tongue! They parted in their sadness! They had yet to live to know Earth can scarcely boast a gladness Worth that bright enchanted woe.— They parted in their sorrow, But its vain burst was controlled By the magic word “to-morrow,” And their young hearts were consoled. Had they marked with sense prophetic All that magic mighty word, Shrouds of awful and pathetic— Should they not have more deplored. Had they marked how swift to-morrows, With a never-failing pace, Should bring them all their sorrows— Steal each joy—each charm—each grace. Age and pain, and death's self—bringing, Changing never its smooth name, Had their hearts, with glad up-springing, Hailed that treacherous word the same? Oh! to-morrows on to-morrows Crowded thick—thus leave at last But that dark brief hour that borrows All its substance from the past! TO ME ALIKE. To me alike pass night and day— Time's wings are, sure, of lead— To all things still, when thou'rt away, My soul is as the dead. They tell me this proud scene is fair, And that is glad and bright— I only know that light and air To me seem death and night! And, oh! if thou love, art not there, In sorrow's paths I tread; And unto all things, glad and fair, My soul is as the dead!— But thy Promethean presence gives Such life—such energy— My soul then so intensely lives— I feel I cannot die!— E'en overflowing then with life, My soul appears to be, Luxuriating in its proud strife, Fervent, and full, and free. All things unlovely e'en seem fair To me—in gladness, then; The world seems formed of light and air Till thou depart again.— My life goes with thee!—and my soul— In vain, in vain for me Suns blaze, flowers bloom, and bright stars roll— No sight of joy I see. Vain things seem sunshine, flower, or star; Where may their beauty be? Is all their light indeed afar— Their soul and mine with thee? To me now seem the night and day— Like dull twin-shadows spread, To all things still, while thou'rt away, My soul is as the dead! SONNET. [Vesuvius! I have seen thee in thy might] Vesuvius! I have seen thee in thy might, Forth vomiting thy threatening smoke and flame, As with some reckless and unhallowed aim; Crowned, like a ruined sun, with blood-red light!— Angry—portentous—troubling the awe-struck sight— Not centuried slumbers can e'er make thee tame: Thou'rt still in will and purposed wrath the same. Scowling at Time upon his arrowy flight, How dost thou fierce and frowning seem to be, (As though thou felt thyself banned—unforgiven) The ruthless foe of earth, and sky, and sea, Whence peace and beauty by thy wrath are driven, Wasting the earth's pride—o'ershadowing blue waves free, Heaving, as 'twere, a very hell to heaven! SONNET. [Mont Blanc! on thee in reverent joy I gaze] Mont Blanc! on thee in reverent joy I gaze; Lo! thy tri-forked head is gleaming now As with a galaxy of crowns!—thy brow, Thy most monarchic brow, in their bright blaze, Is hid in uttermost splendour—O'er thee plays The morn, whose chief rays to thy high crest flow.— So sun with sun might commune, a proud Show!— Earth seems in thee her towering head to raise!— As the redeemed and glorified should do, E'en to the Eternity of heaven above, As with a mighty rapture ever new.— Yes! Earth seeks Heaven in Mountains!—as with love And trust and zeal.—And we—should we pursue Our way care-bowed—the o'er-gazing hills reprove! SONNET. [Hushed Hour! which doth Heaven's Hour of Earth appear!—] Hushed Hour! which doth Heaven's Hour of Earth appear!— Whose depths of rest and peace none, none may sound! Grey twilight hour, with tenderest shadows crowned, Thou art a time most dreamy and most dear; And all is quiet now—afar and near; Earth's fever seems soothed down by calm profound— Faint, shapeless shadows float in peace around, Low wordless whispers tremble to mine ear!— I break the chains of fear—grief—memory!— As I have ofttimes found—once more I find, While this strange stillness broods o'er earth and sky— Thoughts crowd on thoughts within the awakened mind, Full, fervent, far-aspiring still!—on high Lifting the world with them, or leaving it behind! SONNET. [Sorrow! thou broodest deeply o'er my soul] Sorrow! thou broodest deeply o'er my soul, And fitt'st on every thought thy cramping chain; But long inured to heaviness and pain, I bend to thee submissive; and controul Vain murmurings ever! dark the waves may roll And deep—but fair pearls hid beneath remain:— They know, who oft have bowed to thy dim reign, That magic words are writ on thy dark scroll, Spells of enchantment!—and that precious things Are mid thy stores; thou brood'st o'er my lone way Like some proud Eastern bird, with mighty wings, Some dark, illustrious bird, that to the day, (O'er which—round him—a gorgeous gloom he flings—) Like star-bejewelled night, doth his rich plumes display! FOR THE BITTERNESS AND MOURNING. For the bitterness and mourning— To my soul that thou hast brought, For thy falsehood—for thy scorning— Thine unjust and branding thought— For the dark suspense and anguish— Which have crushed that soul's chill'd powers In their fierce toils doom'd to languish, Through the eternity of hours! For that scorning—for that slighting— For thy foul inconstancy, For this ruin, for this blighting, What shall I return to thee? Hatred—scorn—but can I hate her? Lo! I bring—for these loathed cares— (Heart! like her thou art a traitor!) Pardons—blessings—tears—and prayers! HOPE AND HAPPINESS. Hope came, and with a thousand smiles She lit up earth and skies— Then passed with all her gentle wiles, And left a thousand sighs!— Oh! worst of sorrow on the earth To glimpse joy's heaven below— Then know the sentence of our birth Is bitterness and woe!— Hope not!—for still the fervent heart Outstrips joy's portion here— Joy! e'en less beautiful thou art Following her heaven-born cheer! Hope wrongs us—since she shows too much Of Happiness' full light— Bright treasures we may never touch Were better veiled in night! SPRING'S YOUNG DAYS. The Forests and the Fountains have a voice, And freely do they triumph and rejoice;— A deep voice have they now in this glad time, While spring fair-opening charms the softened clime. Would I might stray, in happy idlesse by Those warbling brooks that wake the sylvanry To murmurs of an ever-new delight, And flash their clear blue crystal on the sight.— Oh!—in the beauty of these fresh, first days Would I might feast, and rivet long my gaze On Nature's fine developement, and watch The out-bursting of the leaves, and gladly snatch The faintest first tones of the wandering birds, And mark the quiet of the gladdened herds— The peace or triumph of all living things; While this in silence broods—that soars and sings!— While this seems bent on unreserved display, And that dreams calm, the Halcyon hours away. Should I not then, in mine own joy, forget This world's vain strife and all life's busy fret? Forget that to this green earth's bosom fair, Contention (like a serpent coiling there!—) Is ever closely, strictly, sternly bound, Breathing its venomed atmosphere around!— As though in sooth 'twere a most precious tie, Claiming and meriting such constancy! A tie, a treasure not to be resigned, Which to her breast she would for ever bind! Surely from strife and thoughts of strife set free, I then might gain repose and liberty: But here, amid the city's stir and noise, 'Tis pain to picture e'en those gentle joys Which I am barred from sharing—plunged among The restless, hurrying, discontented throng; Yet in the city's dull and gloomy bound, Some joys of vernal birth may yet be found: The angel of the spring appears on high, And builds her throne Cerulean in the sky. Look upwards—wide she waves her glorious wing, And all the sky is sunshine and is Spring! Thus may the thoughts that tremble at my heart, From this too troubled life's vain din apart; Whate'er they miss beneath of peace and bliss, (And much, and more than words can tell, they miss!) Forgetting not to soar—to hope—to feel— In upward-looking faith and fervent zeal— And unblamed confidence of trusting love, Find all they lack and lose on Earth—Above! SONNET. [Great Privilege and glorious,—to do good!—] Great Privilege and glorious,—to do good!— This—this the meanest and the mightiest share, Since the poor sons of labour and of care, If with the will, and the desire imbued, Possess the power:—when springs an angry feud, Staid words and wholesome counsel may repair The disagreement—and the sequel spare! If sickness or if sorrow come to intrude, On neighbouring homes the poorest can bestow Prompt Aid—Dear Service—and Love's Tears and Prayers. Submission oft from sympathy will grow; And he oft soothes a grief, who pitying shares— We sink beneath the burthens of our woe, If none compassionate or claim our cares. ONE WORD WITH THEE! One Word with thee!—one Word with thee!— Though far we dwell apart; Though swell between us mount and sea, Heart yet shall bound to heart. Heart yet to heart shall throbbing speak, Communion deep and dear— That language is more cold and weak, That lingereth on the ear.— Yet we're so far—that Word of love— Wide wandering in the air— Turns faltering to the Heavens above,— And trembles to a prayer!— So answer it, and pray for one— Who long must joyless be, Who makes thine unseen smile her sun— Whose thoughts are prayers for thee! Pray that her love—too wild, too strong, May yet e'en be forgiven— To waste on earth it must be wrong, A love so worthy Heaven! A LESSON IN SORROW. And wilt thou, wilt thou weep with me? And wouldst thou fain be taught The dreary, weary misery Wherewith my soul is fraught? Tell me, then, hast thou one hope dear, Far, far beyond the rest? Resign, renounce, without a tear, That dearest hope and best! Its dying struggles watch and share— Echo its last long sigh! Its hue of death and ashes wear, And yet thou shalt not die! Bury thine own dead happiness— With thine own trembling hands— (Then bury too thy vain distress— Which yet a vent demands!—) Heap, heap the earth o'er its cold rest Nor dare to shed one tear; Then go and be the revel's guest, And gayest there appear! Renounce thy hope—resign thy joy, And enter on despair— Yet every slightest sign destroy, That might betray thy care! Be all renounced, that e'er yet brought A dream of bliss to thee, And then, perchance, thou mayst be taught To weep—and weep for me! To weep for me—but oh! not yet With me—with me to weep; 'Tis not that sorrows deep beset— 'Tis that the soul's too deep! THE WORLD OF GRAVES. The birds may sing, the flowers may blow, And all look glad and gay— Splendour and music bring but woe— When thou art far away! I ask, “Can this indeed be spring?”— While tears unbidden start; 'Tis but to me, whom sufferings wring One winter of the heart! The flowers are breathless things of bloom, They speak no language now; To me alike, seems glare or gloom— The bare or blossomed bough. I gaze indeed upon the ground, But not its pride to view— Thus strown with garlands free—unbound— Of many a glowing hue! I feel all Spring's bright bloom and breath Is nothing in mine eyes, Compared with that repose of Death— That far beneath it lies!— How many a one is laid in rest Beneath this flowery pall Of Death, and Peace, and Sleep—the guest That yet shall come to all. Fair flowers, ye are not half so fair As that which ye conceal— The peace those silent Sleepers share— Beyond all fancied weal! What very folly 'tis to weep, For those that stricken fall, Because they sleep the sweetest sleep, And bear the tenderest thrall:— Because they are from grief removed— Tears, suffering, change, and death— Aye! Death!—for once they trembling roved, And feared his icy breath. They moved his certain sway beneath, Expectant of the tomb; But now they mock the might of Death,— To them he cannot come! We are his subjects—we his slaves— He marks us for his own; We walk along a world of graves— To one—the deep—and lone! He threatens us at every turn, And shadows o'er our life; And proffers us the funeral urn For all our toil and strife! We are his Subjects—we his Slaves; We tremble round his throne.— Is this indeed a world of graves? Of one—and that our own! The myriads that are sleeping round Are free from his stern sway;— The moment that Death gave the wound— They fled, they soared away.— But feel we not o'er us he yet— Exults—his certain prey— We cannot shun, nor can forget— The tyrant's coming day.— Death, Death, I long to shun and spurn Thy gloomy sway of fear— And yet a sway which more I mourn More dangerous—though more dear. The sway of Love—tremendous power!— That shadoweth o'er my life, And points to thee—and thy stern hour, Sole guerdon of his grief! I WILL NOT LISTEN. I will not listen to thee, Heart! Too sad the tale thou hast to tell; And I must bear my destined part; And I must strive to bear it well. Peace!—peace! my weak and wayward heart, I will not, must not list to thee; Thou can'st have nothing to impart But misery's worst monotony! I will not hearken to thy tale, Importunately fond and vain; Thy broken moan—thy bitter wail, Thy low—faint—sighing, understrain! But if I hearken not to thee, Poor Heart! I'll list to nought beside; Be deaf to Pleasure's minstrelsy, Nor heed the trumpet call of Pride! I will not listen to thee, Heart; But seek to tread my destined path, And strive to bear my destined part, As many another Sufferer hath! THE HEART'S HISTORY. Oh! well it is we do not see, Nor know each other's history!— Grief's power—already far too wide, Were then enlarged and multiplied. How many a buried sealed despair, What sorrows unsuspected there, Should cast the shadow of their gloom— Start hideous from their living tomb! Full many a fault should be shown then Till, oh! we scarce might trust again, (Did once the naked heart appear—) Even the most cherished and most dear. Oh! well it is we do not see, Nor know each man's deep history, The history of his heart and mind— 'Tis well to this we must be blind! We may know what his life hath been— The part he playeth on the scene— His outward trials, troubles, cares; But not how the inward being fares! Yes! we may know our brother's deeds— The part he plays, the life he leads— May mark his triumphs or his wrongs, The rest to Heaven and him belongs. The motives that o'er rule his mind— To these we ever must be blind: The actions are themselves revealed; The springs of action are concealed! The impulse and the chain refined, Which doth the will and the action bind; The countless wheels that ceaseless play, No stranger-eye must e'er survey! Our neighbour's acts of peace or strife, The mode and manner of his life, May be the theme of busy tongues, The rest to Heaven and him belongs!— And well it is we may not see, Nor sift each other's history, A world of woe were then revealed, That had far better rest concealed. The feeling heart should then deplore A thousand thousand times the more— For, oh! how deeply should it know This world to be a world of woe! SONNET. [Nature! where'er thou art we there may find] Nature! where'er thou art we there may find Food for the thought most healthful, and partake Of pleasure all but heavenly—and e'en slake That thirst for Knowledge which devours the mind. Alas! how often prove we deaf and blind— To thee, dear mother-monitress!—then wake Too late!—to ourselves some wretched idol make, That shall betray us when Hope proves unkind!— Thou with munificence' profusion so Dost bless us oft; but men, unthankful men, Poor sordid niggards to themselves, thus throw Away thy gifts and blessings—grove and glen The while re-echoing to the sighs that flow From the unwise heart—again and oft again! THE NIGHT OF SORROW. Sorrow, like Night, brings other worlds in view, Like night can lend them fairest radiance too. The Sun of Joy himself is beauteous shown, But, oh! he lets no light shine save his own! Sorrow! though gloomy thou mayst seem at first Star after star shall from thy bosom burst, Another universe shall slowly spring Beneath the imperial shadow of thy wing! Thou hast thy treasures!—deeper than the sea!— More mysteries in thy sealed abysses be!— A dim Philosophy is all thine own, But to thy vassals and thy votaries known. Thou hast thy knowledge!—Many a weak-brained fool Hath learned Philosophy in thy stern school— And even the sagest can but little know, Who hath to learn the lessons of life's woe. Thou hast thy triumphs!—those with solemn love Who cherish thee—are throned indeed above The common petty accidents of fate— Which with the worldly have so much of weight. Thou hast thy happiness! most strange of all!— But who hath ever mourned—nor can recall That beatific Melancholy brought Through Grief's indulgence to the brooding thought? Sorrow! like Night thou bring'st new worlds to view, Like Night thou lend'st them spotless radiance too: The golden Sun of joy and cloudless bliss Pours one sole light, and shows no world but this— Thanks, Sorrow! for thy teaching!—thou hast been My sable guide through all this earthly scene; Thanks for thy teeming gloom—for shades spread wide— For worlds of mightier happiness descried! JOY'S VISITS. A little while—one little while Came Joy to visit me! I learned the long-lost art—to smile. I felt—strange feeling!—free! One little while—a little while Stern Sorrow sheathed her steel, Removed the fetter and the file, I felt that I could feel! A little while—a little while My heart did gladly beat— Hope! I have found thee full of guile, Yet, oh! renew the cheat! Though soon Grief's frowning power must come, Thy wrecks beneath her feet To tread in wrath, and threat'ning gloom, Ah! still—renew the cheat. Though deep and dark reverses show Thy raptures false as sweet— And though they thus seem doubly woe, Still, still renew the cheat! A little while—a little while Come Joy to visit me, And once more let me learn to smile, And feel—blest feeling!—free! A little while—a little while Stern Sorrow sheathe thy steel; Remove the fetter and the file, And let me once more feel. And, oh! if I once more must bear Fierce Disappointment, yet The tortures of Joy's memory spare,— And teach me to forget! CHILDREN ROUND A NEW-MADE GRAVE. Merrily bounding came the blithsome troop, Full of young energy, and joy, and hope; Then saw their little comrade to the grave Bestowed—but sure no solemn thoughts they gave To that most solemn ceremonial—no!— Soon as the appointed words were said, with glow Of eager pleasure, round the new interred They crowded: one, all fluttering like a bird, And as a bee all busy—in full glee I there remarked in dimpled infancy, With an impatient and disguiseless joy, (A frolick-lover was that rose-cheek'd boy— I doubt not, and a mischief-lover too, With his curled lip and cunning eye of blue:) A sexton's spade he seized, that lay beside That humble grave, so lately opened wide, And now for ever on its tenant closed, That ne'er so calm on mother-knees reposed; That sexton's spade that lay beside he seized, And set himself to work, well, right well, pleased, Fast shovelling down the earth upon the dead— Heaping it thick upon the unconscious head Pillowed beneath how calmly, so i' the face Those peasant-children look on Death, nor trace Those horrors in his mien that millions do; They challenge him, and they caress him too— The mighty Spoiler of the Earth appears To have respect thus for their tender years: His shadowy face their little hands caress— He seems to take them in his arms and bless— And whisper gently in their ear the while, With something like the dawning of a smile, “When weary of this world ye pant for rest— Will I enfold ye to my peaceful breast!”— What want these Babes Philosophers should have! They play with Death, make merry with the Grave— Extract with perfect wisdom, as we see, From heaviest hap—but fearless joy and glee— From shadows force the substance of their bliss, Yet yield no substance in exchange for this— Content with what they have, they seek no more, Yet everywhere they find a boundless store. Death! dreadful angel! art not half dismayed To meet with things so free and unafraid?— The close-clasped hands—the supplicating knee, The imploring accents ever wait on thee— But these—these rosy young Philosophers Thy shadowy aspect awes not, nor deters— They clap their little hands, and shout and dance, E'en in the eclipse of thy dread countenance. They climb thy awful knees—nor dream of doom— As they might climb their father's knees at home; They twine their fingers in thy cloudy hair— And stroke thy hollow cheek, and smile and stare, And pry and peep, with lurking laughter sly, And childish mirth of curiosity; They call thee by some light name of their own, And fear thee less than the old stern sullen crone— Who lifts her crutch and threats them with a blow— Thou!—the Great Conqueror—the resistless Foe!— From whom the monarch shrinks in pale dismay, When some dark warning meets him in his way, Whom e'en the sage recoils from, while his lore Melts from his troubled mind and lives no more! Oh! thou resistless and tremendous Death!— Thou callest, and at once we yield our breath, Forget ourselves—our world—our thoughts, our ties, And die as meanly as the insect dies. Thy presence proves the proudest but a worm, Thy overpowering, all o'ershadowing form Dwarfs—to one level all the mightest here, And makes the loftiest low indeed appear. E'en from these little children let me learn A fearless gaze on thee, at length, to turn; But not—in their light ignorance—not so! For I would pierce the mighty truth and know! Oh! Death, when steadfastly we look on thee— We mark and own thy bright Divinity. We see thee, not a tyrant harsh and stern, Heaping pale ashes in thy charnel-urn; But as our guide, in gentleness and love, From earth to the everlasting realms above. THE MEMORY OF DELIGHT. Oh! Love's deep memory—memory of delight— What hast to show of beautiful and bright?— Thou'rt like a theatre—by day-light seen, Which had the night before resplendent been; But now the silent empty stage is left, Of every pomp and ornament bereft!— The brilliant lights that gleamed in golden showers; The magic sceneries, and the fairy bowers, The proud processions, and the stately shows, Are past, are faded—all is dull repose, And heavy silence, emptiness, and gloom, The theatre is shadowy as a tomb!— Its pealing music now is dumb, and dumb The sound of multitudes, the murmurous hum, Nor on the sense now swells and falls again, The shout of man's excitement—nor the strain Of the artful singer, ringing sweet and clear, And thrilling long on the delighted ear; The echoes of the soft-toned speech are heard,— Nor plaints of mimic woe, nor whispered word— The proud and gorgeous robes should dimmed appear In all their native tinsel—the rich gear Of chiefs and emperors—and bedaubed and rent Those canvas folds, that streamed magnificent, Ere fell on these the keen tale-telling light— And all the illusion's lost to soul and sight! Or like a battle-field, when all is o'er— The strife, the haste, the flash, the mingling roar,— When the gay banners, trampled are and soiled, The warriors' harness all is stained and spoiled; And nought is seen but wretched sufferers round, Dead, or devoted on the encumbered ground. Oh! memory of the Past! thou, thou dost strike My thoughts as mournfully and sternly, like That dark deserted field, that empty stage, Where Shows no longer blaze, nor Hosts engage; Where all is stillness, dreariment, and gloom, The silence and the shadows of the tomb— All that once seemed to charm and to delight Is changed for ever, or hath taken flight; All that once seemed enchantment to our eyes— The dubious thought can hardly recognize; All that seemed full of strength, and pride, and power, Hath waned indeed from its ascendant hour. Are these the things we once so prized and loved? Could these things once have melted us and moved? Are these the glorious triumphs we desired? The pomps and vanities we so admired?— Were these the deep delights that swayed our souls? One cloud of change o'er all the prospect rolls; By frowning darkness it is veiled and cross'd, And all the illusion is for ever lost! THE BLUE, BRIGHT SKIES. The blue, bright Skies are full of smiles, The opening smiles of spring; Some few soft clouds look but like isles, Rosy and blossoming!— Spring after spring hath smiled away The winter from the world, Since first I hailed the light of day, To my glad sight unfurled. And have I with true wisdom stored Deep Nature's lessons pure; And still increased the costly hoard, Still made it more secure.— And do I evermore incline A fond attentive ear, And seek to make her wisdom mine, And ever hold her dear. If not—yon bunch of dew-dropped flowers, The treasure of the bee— The children of these fleeting hours, Are wiser far than me. And while they shine out in the sun, On yon fair grassy knoll, A nobler, loftier race they run Than my immortal Soul!— Shame on the immortal soul, then, shame!— That thus its duty shuns, Forgets each loftier, lovelier aim, And ill the great race runs. Spring, if I hitherto have been Obdurate, cold, and blind, Now let thy softly opening scene Impress my wakened mind. SELF-COMMAND. I check my thoughts—I hush my sighs, My sorrows I controul I dash the tears too from mine eyes, And challenge mine own soul! And for a while—a little while, I do right well succeed; I can put on the feigned, forced smile, Whose falsehood few can read! I can affect the joyous tone, The words of folly say;— And there is many a happy one That seems but half as gay.— I can awhile succeed to throw The mask and covering veil Over the wildness of my woe, Till none might guess my tale! But can this last? oh! only while The motive is supplied— I check the sigh and force the smile From woman's wounded pride.— But when I leave the joyous train— I feel pride's little worth, I sink into myself again!— The unhappiest of the earth Again into myself I sink— And am a wretch again; And fit and fix e'en link by link, My galling, crushing chain! And, oh! to me 'tis a relief— To take my burthen back, And to return unto my grief, So bitter and so black. 'Tis sweet relief for me to sink Into my grief again; From forced content my feelings shrink, More than from very pain! I prize that pain!—each bursting sigh Seems but to me too brief!— So much I love my love that I Must love my love-born grief! QUESTIONS. Beloved! art thou waking or sleeping? And, oh!—art thou thinking of me?— Mine own! art thou smiling or weeping, And dost thou wish I were near thee? If thou'rt sleeping, fair love, art thou dreaming?— And, oh! art thou dreaming of me? If thou'rt waking—bright plans art thou scheming— Still wishing that I were with thee?— Art thou hoping, my dearest!—or fearing?— Are thy hopes and thy fears but for me? Is this World unto thee still appearing, As dark as to me, without thee?— Mine own! whether waking or sleeping, One image is present with me; Hoping, fearing, or smiling, or weeping, I ever am wishing for thee. THE LAST MEETING. I saw thee last—and not for long, In some mixed company; I hated that surrounding throng That severed thee and me. Our hearts were silent—and our eyes Looked calmly, coldly then; I would not bear such agonies For all the world again. Better to be dissevered far,— With lands and seas between— With rocks and mountains for a bar, Than be as we have been.— So near, and yet so wide apart, Together, yet afar; In separate solitudes of heart,— These pangs earth's deadliest are. Let me not see thee so again— 'Tis almost worse than woe— It is an ecstacy of pain I wish not fiends to know! ONE MORE FAREWELL! One more farewell! one more farewell! When happiness is o'er We love upon our grief to dwell, And make it more and more. We love then to increase the sum Of our worst, wildest woe— As though we hoped some change must come, When thus the worst we know. One more farewell! one more farewell! And then, alas! to part! Oh! could I in that one word tell The history of my heart. No! no! I dare not now express— That wish for thy sweet sake; Couldst thou see my heart-wretchedness, Then thine would surely break. One more farewell!—one more farewell! Then all indeed is o'er— Then on this rich grief let us dwell, And make it more and more! Oh! linger, linger on this last, This last sweet word of love; Pour all the Passion of the Past, On this, to melt and move.— Be all the Past's dear Passion poured, In sweetness and in strength— On this intense and burning Word, Our only wealth at length! From thy loved lip the last, last sound Thine own Devoted hears, Her heart, the fervent and profound, Must live upon for years.— For rolling years the days shall seem, When thou, Love! art away; Thy smile's bright sun, no more must beam To make her darkness day! One more farewell!—one more farewell! When every hope is o'er, We love on our despair to dwell, And make it more and more. Oh! linger, linger on this last, This last sweet word of love— Then all my peace is with the past, And all my hopes above! A TRANCE OF THOUGHT. In that trance did my soul and the universe seem E'en triumphantly—gloriously One, 'Twas my Soul was the Air, and the Earth, and the Sky, The Heavens, and the Stars, and the Sun. Or it saw itself brightly reflected therein, Till it cried, “Ha! Ha! am I so great? I may put on my strength, then, and mock thee, stern Time, And mock thee, bleak Death—and thee, Fate!— “For mine outlines majestic I proudly may trace, On this Earth—and the Heavens far above; And I know their reflection yet loftier must be In the deep of the Fathomless Love!” I may mock thee, dull Destiny!—mock thee,—dark, Death! For myself I am mightier than all— And my Shadow shall yet lend the Universe light, When around me in ruins it fall. CLOUDS! LOVELY CLOUDS. Clouds! lovely Clouds! How move ye brightly on, Like fiery dust whirled round the Chariot Throne Of yon victorious, radiant Lord of Light— Beaming in boundless glory on the sight— Yon bright, auspicious, beatific sun— Whose daily course is now full nearly run. Clouds! lovely Clouds! how gloriously ye move In rich and rapid restlessness above!— Nay, all the Firmaments around ye, make Appear in glowing motion, when ye wake Unto the touch of some triumphant Wind, And speed, as ye would leave e'en space behind! It seems while sweep ye thus,—ye life-like things, As Heaven were moving on all gorgeous wings, From Boundlessness to Boundlessness along— Rolling, like mighty Seas, when Storms are strong— As all the everlasting Heavens above, Rush'd as ye rush, and moved e'en as ye move!— (Ye hurrying, restless, unreturning things!)— While all their worlds were speeding upon wings. Clouds, Clouds, I love ye—and I love to dream, Borne on glad Fancy's smoothly flowing stream. That ye in twenty thousand lovely forms Precede—survive the stern and shadowy storms.— Chariots, and mighty barks, and golden towers, And palmy groves, and fair Elysian bowers— And trophied piles of Pride, and mighty pyres— And pyramids, and monuments, and spires— Bright oriflammes and canopies of state, And blazing scrolls of deeply written fate, And gates of glory—and imperial tombs— Crowned sheaves of plenty and wide-waving plumes— And bannered armies—and thick-jewell'd thrones, And gorgeous shrines emblazed with precious stones, And sumptuous shells of giant size, ye seem, And many another thing to my swift dream. Oh! lovely Clouds, I call ye regal things In your oncomings and evanishings. The glorious Sun his own dread beauty views On your fair faces—blazoned with his hues— Ye are his stars!—for those he may not see Which his own light doth banish instantly— But ye reflect, in rosy beauty bright, The glories of that pure effulgent light!— Clouds, lovely Clouds—ye free and fearless things— Would of my burthened Soul ye were the Wings! GENTLE DOVES! Gentle Doves, how soft your moan!— Sadness swells in rich sweet tone— Oh! to interpret ev'ry sound— That seems to imply an inward wound; And oh! to know what means that note Ye seem thus to repeat by rote— 'Tis but the depth of your delight Haply that doth thus unite Your music-moan with Grief's faint style (Our human sufferings to beguile!)— The sweet, sweet music consecrate To woes and miseries of dark fate By our sorrowing hearts may prove To ye but lays of Joy and Love!— Still all that's beautiful is known To ye as beautiful alone!— But, oh! how many glorious things For us are linked with Grief's sharp stings: Half—half Earth's loveliest wealth is lost To us; whom Sorrow shadoweth most!— She takes too much for her own share Of all that's bright in Earth and Air!— Too much to her young Joy transfers— Half of the beautiful is hers— Oh! far too much—as well they know Who e'er felt—(who hath not felt?)—woe! The twilight's soft and tenderest hour— When fleeting dreams and dews have power; The moonlight-sea in its repose— Which momently more beauteous grows; The autumnal glories of the grove— When the year's pomp is on the move (Yet never more sublime to see Than in that fall of Empiry!—) The silent gathering of the storm— O'erhanging Earth, like some vague form, Indistinct and shadowy all— Upbuilding darkness like a wall— The silence of the starry sky— In holy Night's regality; The perfect beauty without breath Of a young child's face in death— Still these things, these things Sorrow claims— She calls them by pathetic names— She takes them ever for her own As her's they are for ever known— And yet how many more beside In this august Creation wide Silvery sounds and shadowy sights— Fleeting visions—floating lights; Dreamy presences and powers— Mighty changes—mystic hours— Oh! far more than I can say, Sorrow's rule and reign obey— For Joy hath given them up to her, And so she makes them minister To her most sad needs evermore, Until the wave sleeps on the shore— (The calm wave of the moonlight sea, Transparent in tranquillity—) Like to a dying thing, whose death E'en makes us, saddening, hold our breath— Till the loosened leaves that know— The autumnal, hectic, Hesperus-glow, Seem to us, with sighs and moans, To mimic faint the mortal groans— Of expiring creatures, fain To live, and languishing in pain— Until the starry silent sky, In its empyreal majesty— Seems to us almost to mourn For Worlds from its embraces torn— Worlds that perished and that past, Mighty—yet not made to last; Worlds extinguished and decayed— Which the awful debt have paid; Until a fair child's face in death, That hath just resigned its breath, Is to us a gloomy sight, Though lovelier than the orbs of light, That crowd the bright Heaven's beaming space, Running their immortal race; Lovelier than those orbs by far, More beautiful than sun or star— Fair as the soul of heavenly birth— That but just had dawned on earth— Snatched to that Heaven full swiftly back, Ere in the dull, vile, beaten track— It had long enough remained To be either dimmed or stained, Fresh from Heaven—and swiftly sped— Ere by contact, dark and dread, With the things of earth 'twas soiled— Unpolluted, undespoiled, Back to its bright home again, Free from any spot or stain! From Heaven it came—to Heaven 'twas caught, Ere it lost the light it brought!— Oh! Sorrow, Sorrow, thou dost steal, Howe'er that theft thou mayst conceal, Many a lovely thing from Joy— In thy stern service to employ. But theft can ne'er be thrift, and so These fair things, shadowed o'er by woe— Thus saddening, saddening us the more, To the bosom's—being's core, Only make us pant to escape From the threatening, frowning Shape!— Make us long, with earnest mind— Joy and Peace once more to find— Which these stolen treasures bring Back to thought, to pierce and wring With yearnings passionate and deep— While beneath thy sway we weep!— Only make us pant and sigh, More fondly and most fervently, From that sway to move once free— And taste the true felicity!— So much do these most lovely things (While each a mighty message brings— To us still—whose heavenly hints— Deep Feeling on the memory prints!) Paint to us what bliss must be, Reminding us incessantly— Thus of the blessedness of joy— Which gloomy Sorrow doth destroy. Thus thy thefts, oh! Sorrow, vain Still shall be to fix thy reign— On firm foundations in our hearts, Whence almost e'en the life departs In lingering, lengthening languishments— (In sighs and moans still seeking vents—) Sickening with the yearning fond, To grasp the visioned bliss beyond Aye! thus almost the life departs— Fainting in our fervent hearts— With the intense o'erwrought extreme— Of its deep despairing dream, Glimpsing e'en through Sorrow's veil,— Hearing e'en through Sorrow's tale— Something that would be delight, Did not she enforce her right, And win them from their wonted way, Draw them from their aim astray, And stamp on them her shadowy seal, And from Joy, insidious steal!— But theft shall not be thrift—and thus Those stolen treasures shall to us Ever, hints delicious bring Of some glad and blessed thing— Which, when Sorrow's sway is o'er, May be our own for evermore! Gentle doves—your music-moan Makes me dream of bliss unknown, E'en the while that I complain, Beneath the present power of pain! I KNOW I LOVE THEE. FROM “INEZ,” A MS. POEM. I know I love thee far too much, Yet count not this a crime— I own it is a love that stands 'Gainst trials and 'gainst time.— Thou shouldst be loved—but oh! not thus Thou mock'st at Constancy!— And I—I cannot change nor yet Resent a change in thee!— Forgive my loving thee too much— And, oh! in pity spare; Is't my fault I was born to love, Or my fault thou art fair? Is't my fault that too much I feel— For my own joy or peace; Wrap thy false heart in triple steel— But let my love ne'er cease! Oh! that a thousand long, long years I had been born before That bright star blazed out on the world, Which I am doom'd to adore— Or that a thousand long years hence I might look on the light— When that transcendant star is set That blinds and blasts my sight.— But I can wish not one dear charm That decks thy form, away— No, rather let me thus despair, Thus languish day by day. I wish thee not one charm to lose, One charm—one witching grace— Time! cast no shadow of a change O'er that loved form or face!— Be beautiful, be perfect still As now, e'en now, thou art, Though every charm that thou possess— Strike death into my heart. Be perfect and be beautiful, And move triumphant on— More lovely yet—if that can be— Let me be more undone! Let me love on whate'er the tax, The punishment and pain Freedom, and happiness, and peace To me were loss—not gain.— And, oh! forgive me for my fate!— Forgive me that I feel!— Let me still love thee—and despair— Hear—hear my Heart's appeal! THE SONG TO THE ROSE. Oh! glorious rose, No flower that blows, May challenge thee, For sovereignty. Thou seems't to spring, Triumphant thing, From thy bright sire— A globe of fire!— What charms are thine, Thou child divine— Of yon throned sun, Charms matched by none! From his own wings Love brightly flings— O'er thee, fair flower, A starry dower: And Fancy comes, Crowned bloom of blooms— To borrow light From thee so bright. 'Twas thus I praised The rose, amazed Its dazzling hue And form to view!— But Celia came— That rose to shame— With cheek more bright, And eye of light!— The rose turned pale, I saw it fail— Its charms—shamed thing!— I ceased to sing! A brighter theme For Fancy's dream— I welcomed then, And sang again! My rhymes first ran, My song began— The rose to praise In its full blaze— Not with the rose That song did close— But none shall know Its after-flow— Roses and things Which Nature brings— To charm our hours With pleasing powers— We may aloud With zeal avowed— Loud, long, and late!— Thus celebrate! But thoughts there are— Profound and rare— Which we must keep— In the heart's deep— Or only tell To those who well Those thoughts can weigh— And feel their sway— E'en those who share— Whose own they are!— Ne'er tells my tongue, How closed my song! None, none shall know Its final flow— I will not tell Its silver spell! No ear shall find Nor thought—nor mind— Nor heart nor brain— How closed my strain! A WISH. I would I could be near thee now, A little, little while— Then would I sun my shadowed brow In thy resplendent smile! And many things have I to say, Much have I to reveal; Oh! I could talk whole years away— And not say half—I feel! And yet were I beside thee, then— Fresh thoughts should crowding come, And the old ones should sink down again— And fill their silent tomb!— Would, would I could be near thee now, A little while, mine own— For in life's solitude I bow, Heart-stricken and alone. 'Tis solitude in crowds for me— While thou art absent still; A thousand sorrows mine must be, Who bear those sorrows ill! Impatient, restless, unresigned I ever was and am— Oh! Sorrow thou the fiery mind— Mayst torture but not tame! Sorrow! the fiery mind mayst thou Crush down, but ne'er controul— When most to thee my feelings bow Most proudly soars my soul! Mine own! would I could near thee be— One little while—no more— I would lay up felicity— For many a day in store! Oh! I would garner up delight— In my quick heart's deep core, To speed full many a day's dull flight— When thee I meet no more!— Words,—looks,—and smiles,—should be mine own, A world of treasure deep!— A harvest of sweet wealth unknown— Should I industrious reap. Long should I feed on my rich store— And when that store was done, Should I begin then as before— As hope were just begun! For ever in its morning's hour My fadeless love appears— Fresher, as firmer grows, in power, Through still revolving years! HOPE, I ABJURE THEE! Hope, I abjure thee!—thou to me hast been The agony of agonies!—the scene Of life for me is with thy wrecks strewn o'er, Thickly as weeds upon the Ocean's Shore— Now cold indifference soon shall fence me round, From thee and all thy weapons that do wound Invisibly—but mortally—and still Antagonizing Peace, refuse to kill, Cherishing life within the bosom's core, To torture and to agonize it—more! Hope, I abjure thee!—fain would I resign Each smile—each tone—each witching charm of thine! Tormentor! dread tormentor—cherub fiend, That wind'st thyself into the melting mind, To work Destruction's worst!—now fare thee well. Hope! I abjure thee, and had rather dwell, False Halcyon! with the hyæna in his lair, Or fury of the hunted tigress dare— Or with the hungered lion make my couch— Or to the armed alligator crouch— Or stay with venomed angry scorpions pent— Than feel thine ecstacy of languishment— Than dare with thee to strive, with thee to cope!— Thou Halcyon-Hydra—fearful—fatal Hope! THE BURIED SECRET. I have a Secret all mine own, That none suspect or dream; The Sun upon his glorious throne— O'er that may shed no gleam! Thou canst not bring its truth to light, Proud Sun! though strong thou art— 'Tis buried in the deep, deep night Of an upshrouded heart.— Conquerors, with armies for their train, Their trophied pride must vail— Their prowess and their powers were vain— Here, here foiled force must fail! The monarch in his proudest might Should be defied and mocked— That Secret shall be bared to sight, Soul!—when thy Deep's unlocked! The sage, whose searching looks, unchecked, Swift o'er creation roll— Must fail that Secret to detect, Since who can see the Soul? And thou! e'en thou, too, must in vain That Secret's meaning seek— Language were but a check, a chain— Unless that soul could speak! THE NAME OF DEATH. We talk of Death! What is it but a Name, A Phantasy—a Shadow—and a Dream? Dread King of Heaven, 'tis thy Almighty hand That bids the pulse of Life's wild fever stand We cry, Oh! spare us, King of Terrors, spare; And 'tis to thee alone is breathed that prayer! Consoling thought, thou dost but bear us hence To exult in life more ample and intense; If worthy found, if humble, meek and full Of trust in Thee and Him who died to annul Our faults, and their dread forfeiture, and raze That sentence stamped 'gainst them, and all, in days Of the elder time, the sentence dread and dark; But His name is the Strong-hold and the Ark— Amidst the roaring waves—the rushing war 'Tis the one Refuge!—that Sun-lighting Star! Salvation's beams—stream from it, broad and bright, And all the Second Darkness melts to light. Death!—thou art a phantasy—a dream—a name, The smoke of the fresh-kindled, mightier flame, That thus to Heaven aspires, not crushed, but fanned, By the dread waving of the Almighty hand!— That sable-seeming smoke conceals from us The Spirit's guise and garb, all luminous!— The King of Terrors, we may call thee, Death; But thou art bowed the Eternal's throne beneath. Oh! happy knowledge, to the faithful given, The King of Terrors is the King of Heaven! And they, in gratitude o'erflowing, know In mercy 'tis he sends the dreaded blow— For some 'tis rest from burthens dire—for all To Him it is the summons and the call. The King of Terrors is the King of Heaven!— Thrice blessed knowledge to the faithful given! TO THE WINDS. Sing loud, sing low, ye changeful Winds! Ye sing one tune to me— Couched in one dull and saddening strain— Pitched in one mournful key!— Sing loud, sing low, ye can but teach The same dark, heavy truth— Which I too long before have known— Nor now need learn, in sooth! Ye can but teach me that my heart Responds to all sad tones— With echoes passionate and deep As wretches' dying moans. Ye can but teach me that my soul Is Sorrow's veriest slave, And prizeth all things but as they Her solemn impress have. Sing loud, sing low, ye hollow Winds— Ye tell me nothing new— And I have but the same old tale To echo back to you! Oh! nothing, nothing new on Earth Hath e'er been known by me— But dull reflections of the past— My present feelings be!— New sources of regret, 'tis true, Prompt Fate officious sends— I greet those strangers but to find Mine old familiar friends. My hopes are halt—my griefs are grey— My very thoughts are sere— The freshest feelings that I know Old as the world appear! Sing loud—sing low—ye shrill-voiced Winds, 'Tis all the same to me— For wearied of the world within And world without I be! Sing loud—sing low—ye cannot wake— In my sepulchral heart, But one dull echo,—dull and deep, And that doth ne'er depart! And hollow Winds!—ere many years Have run their circling round, (One comfortable thought lives still!) E'en that shall cease to sound! Ye may sing loud—sing low—then, Winds!— May whisper or may rave; Ye shall not wake one echo from A nameless sufferer's grave! THE POWERS OF NIGHT. Clouds, Stars, and Winds, and Shadows, these and Night To lend them all a soul and spell of might, These are the strong and the mysterious things That call the Soul to soar upon her wings— And ask new worlds their wonders; and that wake Sad thoughts as force that Spirit's self to quake Before what she herself but then poured forth, Those bold free thoughts of deep and mystic worth: For a new birth the Soul in joy receives, Reality shrinks back, and wholly leaves The field to Thought, and Hope, and Fancy then;— But this lasts not, the World of things and men, The common, actual, evil World again Calls us and claims us, and that call and claim We must obey, and must become the same! Then Memories, fancies, and delights depart, (To leave behind a sad and yearning heart;) And when the Morning dawns, it finds us all We were before—we have obeyed that call! And higher thoughts and nobler dreams take flight, With Clouds, Winds, Shadows, Stars, and sweeping Night That lent them, in her dread and glorious hour, So much of thrilling and prevailing power! A CHURCHYARD AT EVENING. The Grave-stones in the Evening light, Marshalled in mute array, Shine clearly—and look sheen and bright With the last light of day. Those who beneath them silent rest, Mark not that day's decline— Time! he who is the grave's calm guest, Need fear no stroke of thine. Time, Time and Death, the harsh and dread, The terrible—the stern, Are powerless o'er the unconscious Dead, Who never can return. The bright sun sets, day after day, From them it takes no light; They do not need the officious ray, That makes their grass graves bright.— Time, hour by hour is stealing still From Life its treasures all— His shadows on those sleepers chill— No more—no more may fall!— Time!—thou from them canst nothing take, They ask not the hours to pause— Nor do they quail, nor do they quake— In dark destruction's jaws. The worms with them may have their will, Corruption have its way— They are unmoved, and calm, and still, And know not of dismay! The brave, brave Dead, in utter gloom Untrembling they remain, And what, though earthquakes shook their tomb, That calm they should retain! Though armies trampled o'er their head, No fear should shake their rest; No terrors can disturb the dead, Of endless peace possessed! Elsewhere the soul with all its dreams, Its thoughts and powers hath fled— And midnight frowns—and sunshine streams, Unmarked upon the Dead! But yet the deathless Feeling lives, The Immortal Thought and will— Man his frail tenement survives, And is Immortal still! PRIDE'S VOW. I never more will say to thee— “Be constant, oh! be true!” Thy heart, thy monitor should be Absence' dark seasons through! I would not have thee love me still, If this an effort need! If thy heart to some new touch thrill, Pray thee, leave mine to bleed! If labour it to thee should cost, And vigilance and pains; Still to love on—that labour's lost, Such love my Soul disdains! I never more will say to thee, “Be constant!” ne'er again!— If thy weak heart can faithless be, Why, be it faithless, then!— I have too much of love or pride, Or both, to wish to chain A heart that proves, when thus 'tis tried, So very light and vain! If for one moment thou canst feel Thy love for me decline— To me at once the truth reveal, For thy sake and for mine!— If for one moment weary grows Thy heart of loving me, At once the truth to me disclose, I charge and counsel thee! Think not that I can be deceived, Whatever thou mayst do— My heart should know it was bereaved, By instinct deep and true! I charge, and I implore thee, then, By all thou hold'st most dear— I pray again and yet again— By all thou dost revere;— Seek not to guard thy heart for me, If thou shouldst weary grow Of me and my idolatry— Nor fear that change to show! Oh! tell me all the hideous truth; I could not be deceived; The instinctive heart should know, in sooth,— Should feel it was bereaved! I never more will say to thee, “Be constant, Love! be true!” Thy heart thy monitor should be, Dark absence' seasons through! But, oh! if thou art true—my love Shall deepen more and more— Shall soar its own proud height above— Thrice nobler than before! Those feelings in my soul shall live, That have no end nor bound; Which yet more ardent warmth shall give, E'en to that soul profound. I never more will say to thee, “Be constant!”—ne'er again, If thy heart, Love, can faithless be, Why, be it faithless then! TIME AND ABSENCE. Have we not, many a time—and oft, Discoursed on solemn themes, And felt our souls together glide Along a sea of dreams? Have we not talked of Life and Death, And high and hallowed things; Until we felt our spirits soar— And rise on mighty wings? Have we not oft of love and grief, And their deep, awful powers, Conversed together mournfully In hushed and quiet hours? And have we opened not our hearts Unto each other still? And can these hearts forget to love, And careless grow, and chill? Oh! never, never! one at least Is firm as moveless rocks— Talk not of Absence and of Time. That cannot feel their shocks! Talk not of Absence and of Time, Fresh scenes and rolling hours— For Time and Absence—my deep heart Nor fears nor feels their powers! I see thee—or I see thee not— My happiness indeed Hangs on thy presence, but my love— My love hath no such need! Let me too think that, far or near, Thou lov'st with faithful heart— And still some bliss shall be my share, Or with thee—or apart! WEEP NOT BECAUSE I WEEP. Weep not because I weep—full soon Those tears shall tranquilly subside; My will shall rule them, as the moon Rules evermore the obedient tide! And yet I could not choose but weep— 'Twas a sweet pleasure and a new: Awhile my sorrows seemed to sleep, And thoughts and feelings calmer grew. Yet who would not have said, that then I bore the heaviest pangs of woe; Weak judges—rash and vain, are men, And little of each other know. Where we our warmest pity give— Perhaps it is deserved the least; Vainly and hopelessly we strive To pierce the secrets of the breast. The governed mien, the tutored eye— The lip, calm-smiling, or compressed; The bosom, guiltless of a sigh— May screen a spirit ill at rest. The forehead, cloudless and serene, The expression gentle and resigned, Yes!—all the studied peace of mien— May little prove the peace of mind! The o'ershadowed countenance of grief, The troubled flush—the faultering sigh— The lip that trembles like a leaf, The burning brow—and streaming eye; Grief's wildest, most heart-rending show, That makes the pitying bosom bleed, And own a kindred flood of woe— May much deceive us and mislead! We pity and we envy—wrong! We guess and dream, and but mistake; Strange mysteries unto life belong Whose seal no hand shall ever break.— We little of each other know, We doubt and dream—still much misled— Round us are happiness and woe— But ill their secret springs are read. And it is well!—'tis doubtless well Life's hour is brief, and dark, and rough— Strange storms around us sink and swell; We little know—but know enough! We should mistrust each other more, Perchance could we more closely mark— Until the busy scene is o'er, Around must thousand clouds brood dark. We little of each other know; Each from himself would judge the rest; And we confound their joy and woe, Tried by a vain and hollow test— That which should make us mourn the most May prove another's solace still— And that, through whose loss we were lost To them might bring but grief and ill! Weep not because I weep—oh no! The rather smile to see me blest; Till these sweet tears were taught to flow— How fearful was my soul's unrest. But soon shall these fond tears be dried— The indulgence shall not be prolonged; High burns the courage, strong the pride Of one whom all but thee have wronged! Weep not—my tears may softening flow, And give me more of peace than pain; But thine—but thine—too well I know Were fire unto my heart and brain! REMEMBERED MUSIC. Oh thou beloved, remembered strain, Sweep o'er my rapt sense yet again— And soothe away my wearying care, Or steal my soul from its despair! Soften those sorrows—that torment The mind beneath their dull weight bent, Or teach me, teach me to forget Awhile the source of my regret! Snatch my racked thoughts that weary are To pleasant places fair and far— Win them away from their distress— To hover round sweet Happiness! From their distress to take such flight Shall of itself be deep delight— From suffering thus to be set free 'Twere of itself—felicity! Oh! thou belov'd, remembered strain, Breathe o'er my deepest soul again— Soothe, soothe away its wasting care, Or steal that soul from its despair! Sweet strain—those woes thou canst not cure Thou yet canst aid me to endure— Thou canst not these remove, I know, But lift my soul above its woe— Lift it, its deathless woe above; Steep it in music and in love— In love? alas!—sweet treacherous strain, Thou canst but bring me sevenfold pain! LOVE'S FIRST DAYS. I fain would flee back to the days When first I hail'd Love's dawning rays! Run through their pleasure and their pain,— And live my whole Love o'er again! I fain would watch, as then I did, Deep in my soul's far centre hid, That passion like some bright flower blow, And spring, and spread, and hourly grow. And I would live through every hour That saw the unfolding of its power; Even from the first unto the last, And live again through that sweet Past! Aye! live my whole Love o'er again, Its every pleasure—every pain— And through its rapturous stages run— Hail the first dawning of that Sun! Not half, not half enough I prized, (Though still, even then, I idolized!) Those bright beginnings of Delight— Now more than precious in my sight. Oh! now doth it appear to me— I looked on these too slightingly; It seemeth now to my rapt thought I could not prize them as I ought! How every feeling as it rose,— What value now my full heart knows— Brought with it promises supreme, Which yet 'twas mighty to redeem! When first we love—we know not all The blessings that from love shall fall:— We are not of its strength aware— It seems a mystery vague and fair! We little think how full, how deep, A harvest yet we thence shall reap;— We little know how vast, how great, The joys wherewith 'twill crown our fate! That stranger-guest the soul receives, Nor half his power suspects, believes: So oft at first the Sun doth rise, In mists half-shrouded from our eyes. Then hath fair day another dawn— When slow those pale mists shrink, withdrawn; And light grows lovelier, as its Lord Shines forth—the welcomed and the adored! He rises on us, ray by ray, Breaking through clouds to perfect day— And when indeed that sun shines forth, The Light attaineth lovelier worth.— He toucheth dark thick Woods that turn To splendour, and enkindling burn— With golden glitterings, mid their green; A gladsome and a glorious scene. He toucheth too the slumbering Sea, That mighty giant instantly— Girds on, right glorious to behold— Armour of purple and of gold! But in the cold, gray, dubious dawn— (Or e'en before such mist's withdrawn, Spread round the Enchanter) who would dream, Of dazzling triumphs so supreme? The cold, grey dawn goes deepening on, Till every dream and doubt is gone— Then beauteous spreads the stainless light, To be more beauteous still and bright! When morning's mantling mists retire, Day dawns again!—one globe of fire!— Flames the broad sky—the air's a blaze— Light breaks thrice-glorious on our gaze! Oh! Love hath thus his dawn, his mists— We first scarce know that he exists— The soul's transpierced with his deep light, Before himself stands forth to sight. With his deep light the soul's o'erflowed, Ere she may know whence 'tis bestowed: First comes his dawn—and then his day— His Sun exults in boundless sway! Himself, ere his full State's unrolled, He clothes in purple sheen and gold— Life's streams then stooping brightly nigher, Makes the lit World a globe of fire!— Oh! Love's first days! could I speed back, Following your fair and happy track— How should I prize, with conscious thought, Your opening prospects as I ought! Blessed beginnings of delight!— How should I weigh your worth aright!— Could I but break Time's crushing chain, And live my whole Love o'er again!— Fain would I watch, as then I did, Far in my soul's deep centre hid, Thee—Passion, like some bright flower grow, From bloom to bloom—and burst and blow. No! not as then as I watched, my heart, Scarce knowing, dreaming all thou art— Received thee in its deep recess— In shadowy half-unconsciousness! OH, NO! THOU DOST NOT LOVE ME! (FROM “INEZ,” A MS. POEM.) Oh, no! thou dost not love me, think it not; If thou didst love me—as I once believed— Couldst thou have left me to so dark a lot? No! thou and I were both too much deceived. And now thou seekest, but thou must seek in vain, The fond and fair deception to prolong— The truth hath shot like fire through heart and brain, That love is nothing—that I deemed so strong!— If thou hadst loved me, could'st thou have endured With cold indifference' vainest, lightest show— To wound the heart which nothing hath allured, Through thy mourned absence, from its constant woe! If thou hadst loved me, couldst thou have forgot How sensitive are Love's quick feelings fine! Thou still mayst swear it; I believe thee not! My soul, that loves indeed, condemneth thine! Be faithless, and be cold,—but still, I pray, Deceive me not thus doubly in my woe— Hate me—but hate me openly—Away With vain disguise—if 'tis so, tell me so!— SONNET. [The expectant Earth awaits thee, loveliest Spring!] The expectant Earth awaits thee, loveliest Spring! And she shall greet thee with a burst of glee, A mighty show of proud festivity, More then e'er welcomed yet a new-crowned king, Or conqueror, who himself might tidings bring Unto his country that 'tis great and free, And that himself hath wrought the victory.— Hark! how the vernal Woods resounding sing! Now strewn the Earth is, with soft flowers, whose bloom Makes her as rosy as some glorious star— That doth clear hues of sunniest sheen assume, Though trembling in the firmaments afar!— The expectant Earth awaits thee!—Come, oh! come! These are thine hours—but chill and bleak they are! NIGHT'S SHADOWS. I heard the Winds, whose voices seemed To chide and groan the while, I saw the Shadows of the Night— No star there lent its smile! My heavy thoughts like mountains lay Upon my soul that night, For night-black frowned my Future then, When Hope lent not her light! The Future evermore must be Darkness—to us, who know But what now is,—and what hath been— Not what shall be below. Yet seldom, seldom seems it thus, For Hope—that Night's sole star, Illumines still its depths of gloom, And tempts us from afar. But if her gentle beam decline We are indeed bereft; Darkness and doom and coming death Alone for us are left. The Winds like awful Prophets seemed, On that dark clouded night, To warn of coming woe the while, I heard them in affright. Night's heavy shadows threateningly Stretched far and wide around, They seemed to deepen more in gloom— I trembled as they frowned! Cheerless indeed the prospect was, And gloomy was the hour, But 'twas my cheerless, gloomy Soul That lent them fearful power! My thoughts like crushing mountains lay Upon my Soul that night; And, oh! they had as heavy been In Midnoon's sunniest light! ABSENCE IN PRESENCE. Let me not meet thee in the crowd again! 'Twas too much blighting bitterness of pain, Absence in Presence—it but seemed to be A doubt—a torture and a mockery. It was not meeting—it was parting, more Than ever we were parted sure before!— Our very souls seemed e'en as strangers then: Let me not meet thee in the throng again! Few words and distant—guarded looks and brief— Cold courtesies and forms—oh! killing grief! Fly me for ever, rather than dwell thus Beside me, with a world dividing us! Each look of thine, so guarded and so cold, Pierced like a bolt of ice through my heart's fold; And yet had I as coldly to return Those chilling looks, and all their calmness learn! Let us not meet in crowded halls again— The howling wilderness, the savage glen, The desert shore, with stormy skies above, Were happier trysting-place for those who love. I would not meet thee in the crowd, Love! more,— Where the heart aches with the unimparted store Of hoarded feelings, and affections deep: Yes, the heart aches—but dares the eye to weep? All is constrained and artificial there: I tremble lest the very soul should share The coldness which disguises all it feels, And crush the emotion it so well conceals! Not for mine own—not for mine own Soul—No! Else it had suffered not such torturing woe— Else had it been content to meet thee thus— Meeting, miscalled—a world dividing us! Yes! by the world were we divided there! By its congealing breath, and bold bleak stare— Its heartless sneer, and artificial tone— We were together—lonelier than alone! We were together—but how far apart! There might be no glad bound of heart to heart— No flow of thought to thought—alas! alas! Absence in Presence!—dull and dreary, 'twas! Those who are meeting in the silent grave As fair a meeting, and as joyous have— And could we darkly be together there, Such meeting were as happy and as fair. Happier! thrice happier!—there the conscious care, The sense of suffering—feeling of despair— At least were spared, and the poor heart set free, Were cold as it must here appear to be. Let me not meet thee in the crowd again— 'Tis too much fearful and o'erpowering pain— Our very souls seem then as strangers grown, Our hearts' best feelings are not then our own. 'Tis misery thus to hide the gush and glow Of thoughts and feelings, checked in their deep flow; Misery to shroud, e'en from the most beloved, The soul's emotions—with a mien unmoved!— But would I that the vain and careless crowd Should for one moment pry beneath that shroud? From such a thought, with loathing dread, I start; The hand of Death could scarce more chill my heart. How from the withering gaze—the inhuman stare— That heart, if for one moment's space laid bare— Would shrink, as waters from some open urn, When summer suns with scorching fury burn. 'Twere death to each deep thought, each feeling pure, That, that were more, Love! than I could endure, Compared with that, less torturing is the smart Of forced constraint and coldness to the heart. Better the studied speech—the guarded look— Absence in Presence! better can I brook Your lingering torments, and your lengthening pains— For love still lives, though fear his power enchains. But love itself would perish fast beneath The blasting of the world's cold common breath If once 'twas to the common view exposed, To that world's petrifying gaze disclosed! Love, love itself would wane and perish then, 'Twould fade beneath the rude cold gaze of men; And, oh! that loss, than loss of life were worse: To me 'tis Light,—Truth,—and the Universe! Let me not meet thee in the crowd again!— It is too much of trial and of pain— 'Tis doubt and torture, mockery and despair: Let us not meet, not meet again, Love, there! Better, far better in the grave to meet; Not there, at least, were we constrained to greet In coldness—nor to assume indifference then:— I must not meet thee in the crowd again! LINES FROM INEZ, A MS. POEM. I gazed upon thy face—my joy! my pride! That face more dear than all the world beside, And all the world contains of bright, to me Unrivalled in its sweet supremacy!— The soft suffusions and the expressions there, Those blushing tints, bright as Morn's roseate air— Those kindlings of intelligence, and more, Those shades of feeling, made my thoughts run o'er With admiration words might not express— And more unutterable tenderness! Had Love's soft shade been banished from thy face, There nought of human would have stamped its trace, So much did thine all-beauteous countenance, When thou wast wrapt in some far-soaring trance, Speak of another word—a world of light, Reflected in its living mirror bright. Methinks each thought that thrills and wakens thee, Mine own! must be an immortality! And Thought by Thought thou thus shalt brightly rise, Till all thy soul's exhaled into the skies! I almost tremble as on thee I gaze— At times when o'er thy lovely aspect blaze The dazzling shadows of these thoughts supreme, Lest thou should vanish from me like a dream!— Lest like a vision thou shouldst melt away, Or float on the receding light of day! What time the bright sun leans into the west, And leaves the world to shadows and to rest, I almost tremble, dear one, lest indeed, From mortal and from earthly trammels freed, Thou thus before me shouldst triumphant rise, Exhaled into the bright Etherial Skies!— Even Thought by Thought thy heavenly Soul exhaled Into those heights that none like thine hath scaled! THE SONG. Sing me that soft and silvery song— 'Twill bring old thoughts, a shadowy throng; That song of old thou lov'dst to sing; A train of well-known dreams 'twill bring. Oh! Music, mighty is thy power— What is the place—and what the hour? I feel—I feel I am once more All that I was in truth before! Still sing that song again, again; It hath unclasped a galling chain; No more I shrink—no more I droop— Memory once more becometh Hope!— Music hath brought to heart and brain The Old World of the Past again— That Old World of the Past so fair, That Past that vanished—lo! 'tis there! 'Tis there, with all its happy scenes, My soul from this bleak Present leans— And seeks to strain in its embrace That Past—whose paths it can retrace!— Sing still that song—again, again Let pleasure come to chase dull pain: My soul this dull blank Present leaves— To her embrace the Past receives! Sweet thoughts, and dreams! that, long before, Kindled and thrill'd my glad heart's core, Aye, come in freshness once again, In shining throng and smiling train! Ye seem not changed—ye are not cold— Ye warm me to my heart's deep fold— Ye are not dull—ye are not tame— Oh! thoughts and dreams, ye're still the same. Joy! for my soul then is unchanged— Nor yet from feeling's glow estranged; Shine on the surface, but, the light, And 'twill reflect it back as bright! Sing still that song again, again, And break the galling, crushing chain, That long hath sorrow known to wind About my sinking heart and mind. Make me e'en thus myself once more; Renew me to my heart's quick core; Repair the waste of Time and Woe— And let my long-check'd feelings flow. Sing that sweet song again, again, I live, I breathe, in that deep strain; I bless its sound—I dread its close, Lest that I lose my new repose! SONNET. [Spring's golden Sun is in its evening hour] Spring's golden Sun is in its evening hour, And tenderness o'er earth's new freshness broods; That setting sun, now brightening o'er the woods, Speaks still of change and parting, with deep power, And tunes the proud strain of our feelings lower. Evening is the autumn of the day—and moods Of graver vein—while still one thought intrudes— Come o'er our minds—when falls its golden shower Of glittering beams around—and that one thought Is of the passing of all earthly things— Oh! this spring-evening's setting sun hath brought Hints of calm wisdom to my soul, whose wings At times, though folded, are full often taught To soar where brightly play truth's hallowed springs! THE NIGHT COMES ON. The Night comes on, with stars with clouds, With shades for earth and sea; And well, I hope, with fairy dreams, Ten thousand dreams for me. A thousand, thousand fairy dreams, To shroud my thoughts of woe; Oh! bring to me, thou precious Night, That I sweet peace may know! For all the day unceasing cares My weary bosom load— And with unnumbered torturing thoughts My restless mind's o'erflowed! Bring me a thousand, thousand dreams, Thou shadowy Night—I pray— For more than thousand thoughts of woe Have racked me through the day. And those I would have rooted out, By visions glad and bright— Be then to me one world of dreams, Oh! thou consoling Night! But, oh! be sure, be sure in all, One image blest to enshrine— Or thou, for all thy care and pain, Shalt win no thanks of mine! Bright dreams of joy and visions fair, Without the one loved form, Should seem less lovely than those thoughts, Dark, dark as midnight's storm. And I would shun thee, dread thee, Sleep! And hate and loathe thee, Night! If the Elysium spread in view, And shrouded that from sight. Away! away! those radiant dreams Of beauty and of bliss! Were hideous, hateful to my soul, If purchased thus by this! Away! away! then, glorious dreams, And visions glad and fair; Oh! let me keep the memory still That brings me but despair!— Yet if, oh! Night! and thou, oh! Sleep! That form ye bring to view, And give me peace, at once, and love, Sweet friends ye are and true! Then, Night! speed! speed! with stars, with clouds, With shades for Earth and Sea; With dew for flowers—with rest for all, And, oh! with dreams for me! Let every burning dream repeat One story deep and bright; And set that image in my view— Which is my soul's delight! Though worlds of treasure were mine own, And worlds of hope and bliss, I were a bankrupt of all peace, If fate denied me this!— Give me to gaze on that lov'd smile, Or sleeping or awake— Give this—or all beside on earth, With this—stern fortune take!— Night! faithful friend! and thou, calm Sleep, Most comfortable nurse— Be not unto mine ardent prayer And fervent hope averse! Bring me the dreams that I would dream; A gift to me, oh! Night— More dear than couldst thou proffer me, Thy countless worlds of Light! Sun—golden Sun, when thou in pride And glory dost arise— How shall I hate thee, if thy beams Swift chase them from mine eyes! Unless thou bring sweet thoughts and hopes— Such as I long have missed, And bid me thus in long-lost peace— And long-lost joy exist. But if thou bring no hope, no peace, But drive Love's dreams away— Then goeth down my Sun at dawn! Then darkness is my day! The night comes on with clouds, with stars, With shades for earth and sea; And oh! my heavy soul—I trust With thousand dreams for thee. With thousand fair and fairy dreams, All beautiful and bright— As precious as the stars that pave Thy path—thou lovely Night! Soft shadows after shadows roll— Like waves—o'er sea-like air— These shadows are to me a Sun! If thy visioned form float there! If they bring such visions glad and bright, And thus chase worse shadows far— E'en those that brood upon the soul, Unbroken by one Star! The Night comes on with breathings low, Stars—shades for earth and sea! And, oh! my yearning soul, I pray, With many a dream for thee. WORDS. Nay! ask me not to speak, How vague are words—how vain— I will not, must not seek To speak my thoughts again! 'Tis grief and pain to feel— That by some dull yoke bowed, The more we would reveal, The more we hide and shroud! The more we would reveal Of treasured thoughts' rich hoards, The more we still conceal— For these are wronged by words. Words float like some dull cloud— Around those starry things, To mask them, and enshroud, And chain their dazzling wings. Then ask me not to speak— Since words are weak and vain! I dare not, must not seek To speak my thoughts again! I should mislead thee so!— Thou listenest!—and art led To dream such words can show The thoughts they shroud instead! Thou dream'st thou seest the whole Of my deep love, and strong, And thus the unfathomed soul How bitterly dost wrong! Ten thousand tongues—sweet friend, And languages were weak— Through ages—without end, That mighty love to speak. Ten thousand tongues that spoke Loud as the rolling spheres— Should fail that truth to unlock— Through thrice ten thousand years! Then what shall mortal breath, And mortal language do— Lie like a weight of Death On the thoughts and feelings too! Then ask me not to speak— Since words indeed were vain; For truth's sweet sake ne'er seek To break calm Silence' chain! I SAW THY TEARS. I saw thy tears—entranced in grief— Alas!—I shuddering saw— Stern Sorrow! comes there no relief? Art thou Life's mighty law?— Ever from grief to grief have I Gone darkly journeying on— From misery unto misery— Unfriended and alone. Methought I each dim pathway knew Of Sorrow's Worlds of Waste— Had traversed these, and travelled through Her whole domain at last. Stage after stage—with faultering tread, Leagues after leagues, whose length Seemed but increasing as I sped, With ever-lessening strength!— These heavily and hopelessly I laboured, weeping, through— Till, Sorrow,—well I thought that I Thine every pathway knew. Not so! the while I trembling fared, Thus darkly journeying on, Thy worst, last suffering I was spared Unfriended and alone! The shadow of my heavy doom So mournful and so drear— Not then encircled with its gloom— One than myself more dear. Another Mine—rich, rich in woe, Hath it been mine to find— To teach another's tears to flow— 'Twas a fresh pang refined! Compared with this—this new despair Which words may ne'er express— The Misery of my former care Looks e'en like Happiness! I saw thy tears—at once I felt In that stern hour and brief, While all my soul seemed bowed, to melt, I was a child in grief! I felt, despite of ev'ry ill That I had long deplored, I was but a beginner still In Sorrow's Ways, abhorred! Amazed, aghast with grief I stood, My Soul within me died; By this last, sternest stroke subdued, All hope seemed then denied— Mine other sorrows I had met. Or striven to meet with pride— But here, unmixed and deep regret Rose strong—and nought beside! I saw thy tears—and sought in vain To check their streaming flow— What should I of the soothing strain Of consolation know? Had I attempted to console— I had increased thy care— Feelings too mighty to controul Had forced their fierce way there.— The darkness of my Spirit then Should gloom through vain disguise, And thou wouldst weep yet more again For one who heart-crushed dies! I dare not speak, lest I should show Those griefs I would not speak!— Lest with reflection of my woe Thy gentler heart should break! For me—for me—thy tears have flowed, And for my blighted years; And for the treasures thou'st bestowed, I pay thee back—with tears! Forgive me, and forget my grief; Thine own glad smiles recall, The pity that should be relief— Is the worst pang of all! Oh! leave me, leave me to my fate— In lonely—lorn despair— 'Twill seem less wildly desolate— Than when thy tears are there! SONNET. [Hopes!—Hopes!—how soon, how very soon to leave!] Hopes!—Hopes!—how soon, how very soon to leave! A moment's ruffling—your bright bubbles break, As those do, on yon many-glittering lake! Yours! on the life!—and then we mourn and grieve, And our sick hearts with sighs desponding heave, As though unpitying Fate did harshly take Some real substantial good away—and wake And watch in vain, our treasure to retrieve!— Fair Hopes!—I made ye once my counsellors, My bosom friends!—companions night and morn; But now against ye have I closed my doors— Your treachery I detest—your flatteries scorn— Dread disappointment most my heart abhors— And leaves the rose unplucked, still fearful of the thorn! SONG. ['Tis wretchedness and weariness] 'Tis wretchedness and weariness, To dwell in dark suspense; 'Tis desolation's dreariness— A fiery pang intense! Then every sorrow's worst we know, And live through every grief!— Since in Suspense, for ever Woe Bears the first part and chief! What heaviness!—what dreariness!— Suspense!—thy fevered state!— 'Twere less of woe and weariness— To know the gloomiest fate! For so much still the heart doth fear, To nurse a fleeting dream, It hastes—as if Joy smiled too near, To Misery's worst extreme! TO MADAME CARADORI, SINGING. Thy voice is like the loveliest softness bland, Of the sweet, sweetest south, and many a band, Which chained (or seemed to chain them wearily, Until they languished, and were like to die.) Bright flowery treasures of the dreaming mind, All delicate and fragile and refined— It loosens now; they brightening bloom, and blow Beneath that magic breath, and breathe and glow Themselves, and turn to music, though they were Moveless and mute, till freed by that sweet air— That trembles o'er them now—a breath divine: 'Tis surely sent from realms where cloudless shine Immortal suns, in glory of repose— Where rapture ever soars, and splendour glows. Oh! melody supreme, thy magic balm Pours on the stormiest spirit, and 'tis calm! How mighty is thine influence! Sweetest voice! Thou bids us thrill, weep, tremble, or rejoice, Or hope or fear, remember or forget, Or nurse new schemes—or cling to old regret. And still unhesitating, we obey, And love the fulness of thy tyrant sway. Scarcely I know myself, while thus my soul Is under thy delectable controul: Less wild and yet less weak that soul feels then, My heart less sad; sing, Syren, sing again! Scarcely I know myself beneath thy sway, Sweetvoice!—thoughts—dreams of many a byegone day In power rise up again within my mind:— Dull clouds melt off, and thousand chains unwind! 'Tis that old feelings thrill me—that alas! I am a stranger to the self I was! That to be thus renewed, restored, appears— To be e'en snatched to other worlds and spheres!— To be another being, and to live Another life,—still, still these raptures give!— Oh! voice of music! still awake my soul And bid its thoughts in softest echoes roll; With thy rich tones, set this bruised spirit free, Teach it thine own delicious harmony— Oh! beatific voice—so shall it prove Worthier at least to listen and to Love! THE CHANGE OF SEASONS. Soft blows the light and gentle air— Bright gleams the unclouded ray, A spirit seemeth everywhere, To brood or float to-day. Mysterious meanings seem to be— In all that crowds our way, A voice is given to flower and tree, To breeze and cloud—to-day. 'Tis the first sunny day of spring, Doubt not, the awakened heart Is busy now, with many a thing That makes it thrill and start! The change of seasons well may bring Grave thoughtfulness and care— And trouble many a secret spring, And wake deep feelings there! These seasons, in their constant roll, Their mighty course fulfil, And seem to question of the soul— If it is punctual still! If it as strictly doth obey The invariable command— And swerve not on its onward way— From laws that changeless stand!— If duly it with duteous zeal— Perform the allotted task— How doth the soul then stricken feel,— Nor answers what they ask!— Not Conscience only wounds the heart, Memory and Love awake, And play therein a busy part, And through old fetters break. The change of seasons ever speaks Of other changes round— And each new season may we seek For some that are not found! We find, we feel their loss then most, The banished ones, beloved; For, oh! who hath not loved and lost, And 'midst Earth's mourners moved— Who hath not some dear kindred dust With bright affection loved— And placed therein their joy and trust, And been by Death reproved! To all that e'er have wounded been By Fortune's freaks of change— The new-born season's varied scene Speaks—not in accents strange! When Summer to young Spring succeeds, And o'er the glad world breathes— To make Spring's blooms seem but as weeds Beside her prouder wreaths! How do we feel the loveliest rose Of Summer soon must share The spring-flowers' fate, and withering lose Its beauties, fresh and fair!— How do we feel that many a thing That brought us pure delight Hath vanished, with that faded Spring, For ever from our sight!— When Autumn in the Summer's place, Comes proudly trampling on— And all the rosy light and grace Of Summer's mien is gone— When the Autumn from his armoury brings His countless golden spears, And proud as palaced courts of kings The common field appears; How do we, softened, grieve and sigh, That Summer's joy is o'er; That so much loveliness should die, And change, and be no more! Yet not for thee our tears flow free, Oh! Summer, lost and flown— Rose of the year!—'tis not for thee We make our heaviest moan! We think of Life's fair summer sun, By clouds obscured and changed; Of Life's bright flowers—whose charm is done, From bloom and scent estranged! We think of hours too sweet to last, Alas!—too dear to lose— That yet we dare not call the Past! The while we mourn and muse! The Past we dare not call them yet! Nor to ourselves allow— Their truth is o'er—their sun is set, That they are nothing now! So o'er the lovely and lovely dead The mourner bends and weeps; And fondly seeks to be misled, And strives to think it sleeps! Nor dares unto himself to own, Not to his soul to tell, The truth to every feeling known, Too bitterly and well! When Autumn unto Winter yields The sceptre of his sway, And woods, and banks, and hills, and fields, Grow gloomier day by day— Thoughts spring in the most thoughtless breast, Deep dreary thoughts, and stern; The soul owns many a shadowy guest— And lessons deep must learn! Lessons and truths she knew before— And knew full well, 'tis true— But brought home to the bosom's core, They then seem strange and new!— Winter! thou lookest old as Time, And stern and bleak as Death— Thy dim day seems to have no prime, Thy frozen air, no breath: Unless in tempests 'tis unbound, While hills and valleys ring; Then flaps it furiously around— Destruction's shadowy wing. Of Time, the grey and wrinkled Time, Thou bidst us think, who comes To rob our fair day of its prime, And thin our darkened homes— Of Death, the dark and frowning Death, Thou dost remind us well— Whose heavy frost shall bind our breath, Our bounding pulse shall quell! And e'en when Winter yields to Spring— The empire and the hour— Thought ofttimes doth a shadow fling O'er her fresh, vernal bower. Yes! e'en when Winter, Winter yields To smiling Spring the sway, As now it doth—o'er groves and fields, The heart's long shadows play! The shadows of its memories old— And its new doubts and fears, Thus will they, till the tale is told, Of seasons and of years! Though lightly blows the gentle air, And brightly gleams the ray, A Spirit broodeth everywhere, Around, methinks, to-day. A mighty Spirit everywhere For evermore doth brood, Over the blue expanse of air— Or twilight depths of wood.— How is it, that through night and day— We do not feel and own— That Spirit's presence round our way?— For ne'er are we alone.— 'Tis wondrous that we do not feel— That presence evermore— Our hearts are mailed in triple steel, Our souls are slow to adore! And thus, when conscious we become Of that dread Presence near, We feel a dimly-brooding gloom— Because we faintly fear! We feel the awful mystery more, In our bewildered dream— Than the great Love we should adore The Mercy—all Supreme. Oh! through the unwearying seasons' round, Their dawning or their close— May I, in trustful love profound, Beneath those Wings repose. Let me, with solemn awe serene, Feel, through each circling hour, In every season—every scene, That Presence and that Power! Let me not wait till it be pressed Upon the backward sense; But seek it still,—nor ever rest,— With yearning hope intense! IT IS THE VOICE OF SPRING. It is the Voice of Spring— The Cuckoo's thrilling call— What tidings doth it bring Of vernal joy to all! Thrice welcome, welcome, Spring— And thou, sweet Bird, again! Now blessed be the wing That sped thee o'er the main. It is a merry time, Oh! Spring—thou'rt all delight— Evening seems fair as prime— And showers as sunshine bright! The least small buds appear Lovely as full-blown flowers To us, who still hold dear Spring's young imperfect hours— Our thoughts, the least hint take; Those unblown buds we view— And see them burst and break— In finished form and hue. We, prescient, see them wake In the young Spring's glowing arms, And for their future sake Cherish the unfinished charms! Oh! Spring! thou matchless Spring!— Thine hours in rapture roll!— Thou art a Voice—a Wing— A Breath—a blessed Soul!— Spring, thou art all delight! Thine Evenings seem as fair As Morning—and thy Night, Stars and ambrosial air! Thou'rt in thy beauty now, And Time, the old hoary Time, Seems wearing on his brow A glowing wreath sublime! The old hoary Time appears In golden youth to be— A smiling front he rears Since he hath looked on thee. OH! COULD WE LOVE BUT LITTLE! Oh! could we love but little, we were wise; But to the heights of feeling still we rise!— We love, love fearlessly, and all the while Our happiness is hanging on a smile— We give our very Souls away—and bare Our Being's core to Destiny's chill air; We cast away the mantle and the shield, And the empire of ourselves to others yield. Oh! could we love but little, we were wise; But first—love cometh in a light disguise, And beckons us, and tempts, and leads us on, Until our way is lost—and we—undone! The instant that we bend before him first We well may shrink, and sigh, and fear his worst! For who hath strength—who courage to defy— That tyrant bright—that Heavenly Enemy? Oh! could we love but little, we were wise! So should we shun unuttered agonies— So should we still with blameless feelings glow, And so escape the wildness and the woe. But who doth thus?—Alas! the grief—the fear— Grow in themselves too precious and too dear; And so in love are we with love's excess— That we forget 'twere wise to make it less! Could I love thee a little—I were wise!— But, oh! from heights to heights of love I rise— Each moment love thee better than before, Yet think I never can enough adore! THERE ARE TREASURES. There are treasures in the Ocean, Which no human eye hath seen; There are clear Springs in the Mountain-heights, Where no mortal foot hath been! There are bright stars in the Heavens, Which no sage hath e'er yet viewed; There are sweet thoughts in a thousand Hearts— Where no stranger may intrude!— Oh! but could the unknown be bidden At once to start to sight— Could the shrouded be to vision shown, And the dark be now made light! All the beauties now discovered— All the splendours now revealed— Should, in sooth, be e'en as nothing then, Shamed and driven back from the field!— There are glories in creation That unveiled have never been— There are treasures in one human soul— That surpass all we have seen! A FAIR, GOOD MORNING. A fair, good morning to thee, Love! Mine only Love and dear— The sunshine sparkles o'er the grove In golden lustre clear. The streams reflect the cloudless sky— One element they seem— Of one fair texture, one bright dye— And sky seems blent with stream! A fair, good morning to thee, Love! 'Tis the glad hour of prime— Mayst thou through one Elysium move, From morn to evening time. The light leaves,—wind-swayed, dance and play,— The winds seem dallying there!— The grass bends where the breezes stray, How dear to Earth seems Air!— A fair, good morning to thee, Love! The sun outshineth bright; But I must still dejected move, Thus banished from thy sight. Beneath thy chamber-casement still I lingered, listening long; How did my heart's quick pulses thrill, With vain expectance strong. I wander, lingering, listless, lone, By flower and stream and tree; For me in vain hath morning shone— How dear art thou to me! Dearer than sky unto that stream Which mirrors it so well, That each far beam each cloud doth seem On its smooth breast to dwell! Dearer than Air unto the Earth In these warm summer times; (Oh! that my words had more of worth, But words are tinkling chimes!) Dearer than all things that are dear, To all that lovers be— That precious and supreme appear, Art thou, belov'd, to me! A fair, good morning to thee, Love! Be all thy mornings fair! Thy noons—nights—dawnings—evenings—prove Blessed beyond compare! A fair, good morning to thee, Love; But, oh! 'tis dark to me; Who must in midnight shadows move, Until thy smile I see! THY MEMORY AND THY TEARS. If I unto the grave go down In mine impassioned years, Say! may I claim then, for mine own, Thy memory and thy tears? In Life we are divided far, Shall Death unite us more? Shine! shine to guide me—thou pale star— Unto the shadowy shore! Wilt thou, recalling all my love, While yet on earth beneath— Through shadows of that memory move And live—in love with death! Wilt thou to me, then, in the grave With fadeless truth incline— And give me all on earth I crave— Tears—tears and thoughts of thine?— To some, oh! Death! thou dreadful art, And frown'st their fate above; Threatening the silence of the heart— Division of their love! But, oh! for those divided far, Severed and sundered wide; As we already darkly are, Such fears are cast aside. Then if unto the grave I go, In my devoted years, Oh! grant me all I ask below, Thy memory and thy tears! GOOD NIGHT!—GOOD NIGHT!— Good Night!—good Night!—my gentle one— Go to thy happy dreams! The sun to-day that o'er thee shone— For thee repairs his beams. To-morrow shall thy tearless eyes Behold a world of light— The very sunshine in the skies For thee, sure, grows more bright! Good Night! Good Night! my gentle one, Sleep but to dream of me, Who Day and Night thus live alone, On one deep thought of thee. Aye! that deep thought is now my soul, None other may I know; I dwell beneath its strong controul, And I would have it so! Good Night! Good Night! my gentle one, Go to thy happy dreams; And bask thee in the brightest sun, Rest by the calmest streams. The stars shall watch above thy sleep, Like gracious, guardian things; And night, the shadowy and the deep, Shade thee with her soft wings. Good Night! Good Night! thou gentlest one, I wake to watch and weep— But let me watch in tears alone! So thou in peace may sleep!— The soft stars and the shadows are My soul's companions then— But on that soul its one bright star, 'Ere long must rise again! THE FATAL TRUTH. I never think of thee without A shudder and a sigh; My dearest Hope is grown a doubt— Ah! canst thou ask me why? I say not thou hast been unkind, Nor charge thee with neglect; But, oh! in thee—an altered mind I sorrowingly detect! The shadow o'er my soul hath crossed,— I know, I feel my fate; Thy love—thy treasured love is lost, And I am desolate! Thou hast not breathed a word of change, But that there needeth not; The heart with conscious tremblings strange, Too soon divines its lot! I well believe thou dost not know Thyself, Oh!—more than dear! That fatal truth which for my woe, To me shines strong and clear. I well believe—thou art not yet Thyself, beloved!—aware— Of all that bids my life's sun set— In darkness and despair! But, oh! no doubt remains for me— My day of Hope is done! I know there must be change in thee— Since all my peace is gone!— Changed words, changed tones, and, oh! changed looks— To me the truth reveal; Harsh Certainty my soul rebukes— For Hopes it fain would feel!— I chide thee not—I blame thee not— I bless—I bless thee still!— Were I forsaken, scorned, forgot, How could I wish thee ill? My withering heart, my wasting life Shall fail—shall fade—and length Of Grief and Fear, the deadly strife, Even now lays low my strength!— Yet well and certainly I know, As through the impassioned past, My soul, through all the Future's woe, Shall love on to the last! The bright stream scorched in summer's hours, Beneath the burning sky— Slow winding through the parched-up bowers, Dewless themselves and dry!— Resenteth not its ruin—no! Still brightly to the last, In its impaired and languid flow, That Heaven thereon is glassed! How, as it shrinketh fast beneath The unpitying sky's hot glare; That wastes it with a lingering death— That sky shines mirrored there! Unto the last those hues it wears— Upon its faithful breast!— That shrunk tide—trembling into tears— In sunshine's smiles is dressed. The heavens, unfaded, still are glassed, By that faint, fading stream— Its pride might seem, unto the last, To wrong not one bright beam!— But still to pour these back as bright, In its expiring hour— As when it rolled in laughing light— In triumph and in power!— Back it reflects that burning blaze, Which must its life-springs waste;— Though death, though ruin's in that gaze— It gazes—to the last! And to the last wears every hue That brightens o'er the sky; Till when you miss the quivering blue, You know the channel's dry! So to the last—like that scorched stream— The parching skies beneath— Shall I be wrapp'd in one sweet dream, That knows no change but death! So like that stream, unto the last Shall I to that reply— Which is—as 'twas, still in the past— My sunshine and my sky! I HAVE THOUGHT ON MY DOOM. I have thought on my doom—and have saddened; Oh! I never may meet it and bear! I have mourned till my spirit hath maddened— Thus uproused to resist such despair! I have mourned with so heavy a mourning, That a mountain were light to its weight— I have scorned—with a wild, haughty scorning— The falsehood that gives me to Fate! I have vowed—I who once could adore thee— To blight thy false heart to the core— Even to study how most to abhor thee— And I love thee ten thousand times more! THE MORNING HOUR. It is the morn's own beauteous hour— In beauty's rich increase— While dews and softest airs have power, And all is joy and peace! All, all is peace and promise yet— Of more perfection's pride— Methinks that sun can ne'er have set That now smiles far and wide! Is this the world where griefs and cares A part so mournful play?— Soft dews and beams and tenderest airs, Chase such a thought away! Glad things now welcome with delight The bright return of Day; While sure of thee, thou shadowy Night, No memory now can stay!— A thousand free and joyous things Tell loud their rapture now:— Hark, to the stir of many wings Rustling through leaf and bough!— Happy ye are—that best employ Your hours from morn till night, In business of great bliss and joy, And labour of delight.— But my rejoicing, thankful heart, Is happier than ye all— It knoweth—rapt in bliss apart, Whence all its blessings fall!— Whence all its boundless blessings flow, In vast and deep increase, That heart in thankfulness doth know, And dwells in Heaven and peace! And it reflects your joy, the bliss Of Life and Nature all! Thee!—Human Heart! that can do this, Earth's happiest thing I call! LOW SIGH OF LOVE. Low Sigh of Love! what sayst thou to the Soul? Thou mak'st one thrilling echo of the whole; The melody of birds in opening Spring, When at fresh dawn the woods awakening ring— The voice of murmuring waves, in sultry days— Where some tired wanderer parched and panting strays Are discord, or are silence to the heart, Low Sigh of Love, compared with what thou art! The sweet, wild echoes of an Ave song, Charming the stillness with their airy throng, So soft—so holy—or the windy moan That wakes the Æolian-harp's unearthly tone,— Or the faint dip of distant, measured oars— Or whisper of sweet reeds on loveliest shores— Are discord,—or are silence to the heart, Low Sigh of Love! compared with what thou art! The evening sound of wings that beat the air, To wake a thrill of more than music there— The sea-shell's watery melodies, that seem To melt the Soul into one ocean-dream, The breezes, mid the leaves, or on the waves, That, sure, wake Spirit-sounds from aëry graves— All, all are very discord to the Heart, Low Sigh of Love! compared with what thou art! GO, AND BE HAPPY! Go, and be happy, mid the gay, Chainless amid the free; Cast Memory to the winds, I pray— Waste not one thought on me!— It was despair, in stern excess, 'Twas death unto my heart, To see thee love me less and less— Now 'twill be none to part!— Already from thee parted more Than seas, than worlds can part, Long, long have I learned to deplore The absence of the Heart! Go, and be happy! take with thee The wishes that were vain To waste on mine own destiny;— I shall not smile again!— Who saith I have not hope?—I have— And all my Soul but lives— In that one hope—that Soul—thy slave, That faints—and that forgives! One hope—one hope, and only one— Shines sunlike in my breast, 'Tis that—though I must sink undone— Thou mayst be ever blest.— Thy happiness is my One Hope— Strong as my self-despair— My Spirit cannot wholly droop While that Hope dwelleth there. Go—and be happy then—be free— Nor waste one thought again Upon my wretchedness and me, Lest that should give thee pain. Spare me the least, the lightest grief— In thy Heart!—Spare, oh! spare! Mine anguish should not know relief If I was wounded there! Spare me then—till in death I rest— The intolerable Woe— Though broken-hearted, still how blest— Thy Happiness to know! Go, and be joyous, mid the gay, Untrammelled, mid the free— And if thou feel'st for me, I pray, Waste not one thought on me! Oh! it was torture's worst excess— Death's anguish to my heart— To watch thy love wane less and less— Now 'twill be none to part! THEY SPEAK OF THEE! They speak of thee—they breathe thy name, Unfaulteringly and loud! And still their accent is the same, On them no memories crowd! That name is like an earthquake's sound, Unto my listening heart; It trembleth to the echoes round, Which from its own depths start. Memories—o'erpowering and intense— Awake at that loved name! I hear it with an o'erstrained sense, And with a thrilling frame! All my soul's joy and its despair Hath hung upon that sound— They speak it as the common air— Might all its echoes bound! VAIN THOUGHTS. Away, vain thoughts! I banish ye, For ever more depart— I will be ruler in my soul— And lord of mine own Heart. Like stranger-presences and powers Those Thoughts appeared to come— And lord it in my abject soul, That trembling heard its doom! How is it that we thus can bow To fancies and to dreams, Which sway the spirit as they list— As winds the ruffled streams? Away, vain thoughts!—rash visitants, I warn ye, hence! away— For I will mine own spirit rule, And mine own Heart will sway. Hence, hence! for while ye here remain I dwell in doubt and fear; But doubts—but fears, I champion now! Ye shall not linger here. Away, ye hovering, haunting thoughts— I warn ye—hence! away! I will be ruler in my soul; Enough—ye shall obey!— Our thoughts should be our servants aye, And wait upon our will— But they would cast the yoke away, And would be masters still.— And dangerous masters they must be, And ruin they shall bring— On those that to their guidance bow, Cowering beneath their wing! Once left to their own wandering way, They rule us as they list— And we, submissive and subdued— Bound with strange dreams exist.— Away, vain thoughts, I will not bow, I will not bear your sway; I will be master in my soul— And rule!—ye shall obey! WHERE ART THOU? Where art thou, my Beloved? and yet What matters where thou art? I ask with tones, more faint, more fond, Where are thy thoughts—thy Heart? Dost thou remember other hours— And other dearer days?— Or do thy thoughts, false wanderers stray, More than thy footstep strays?— Dost look upon the glorious skies, The purple skies above, And for the sake of sunshine past— Their smiles more deeply love?— Dost thou, oh! dost thou think of me, Who in thy thoughts would live?— If no dark change o'erclouds thy Heart, The trembling doubt forgive! Fear dwells with love—and still the more We feel, the more we fear; Oh! how my soul must dwell in doubt, And faultering tremours here! Those who such deep devotion know, But seldom are they just, To the throned rulers of their hearts, Who claim their truth—their trust!— 'Tis in their keeping all their soul, With all its treasure, lies, No marvel that to thrill—to o'erpower— A thousand fears arise!— Where art thou, oh! Beloved?—yet What matters where thou art? I ask with tones more tremulous, Where are thy thoughts—thy Heart?— Mine—faithful with unvarying faith, Make answer—full and clear— My constant thoughts—my conscious heart— My changeless soul—sigh—here! THIS CHANGED HEART. This chang'd heart!—raging tempests have swept it, In the world's waste 'tis one waste of gloom— Yet! oh! yet, if thou wilt but accept it, 'Twill for thee be one Eden of bloom! How did darkness and terrors surround it!— How did wrath with fierce ravage despoil! And how crushing the chain was that bound it!— 'Twas a serpent in death-straining coil!— Pierced its griefs as no life they might leave it, Till it seem'd its own shadow of Death; Yet, oh! yet, if thou wilt but receive it, 'Twill awake to Love's exquisite breath! Ah! how did it in heaviness languish!— Every hope seem'd for ever destroy'd; It still brooded alone in its anguish— On the verge of Despair's gloomy void. There were none in this world to console it, 'Twas approachless in grief and alone!— But if thou wilt but deign to controul it, It shall rise into raptures unknown! It shall soar on—from rapture to rapture, And shall leave fear and memory behind; Nor shall sorrows ere hope to recapture The freed heart and the love-lighted mind! Stronger far than those storms that o'erswept it, Deeper still than those griefs that o'erflow'd— Shall its love be, if thou wilt accept it— And its care's-crushing burthen unload! OH! LET ME BREATHE A LIGHTER AIR! Oh! let me breathe a lighter air But a little while at least— For heaviness, and gloom, and care, E'en like mountains load the breast! Where shall I wander to be free? Where the woodlands echoing ring To the glad birds' merry minstrelsy— And to many a joyous thing! Or where the ocean shines and rolls— To the sun—the strong wind's breath, Where the stars look down, like blessed souls, On the troubled scenes beneath! Or where the ruins of the Past, In their gloom impressive stand, And Time's dread, mighty shadow cast O'er the sunshine of the land! Where shall I wander to be free? Let me even now depart! 'Twere vain—since bound, deep Soul, to thee, And chained to thee—quick Heart! For freedom, gladness, or repose— To me their names sound sweet; But till my weary eyes shall close These hope I not to greet! SONNET. [Repose! best blessing! wonderful and deep—] Repose! best blessing! wonderful and deep— Rich gift of Heaven! scarce prized as it should be— Great, gracious gift of rest!—how thankfully Should man receive it—who oft wakes to weep Through his own crimes or follies!—Blessed sleep!— When we are sooth'd, and hush'd, and calm'd by thee— From all toils spared—from every trouble free— What watch doth Mercy o'er our slumbers keep— What mighty changes are progressing round, What wonders are achieved, what works are wrought In this great universe, without a bound! What acts, what triumphs—far surpassing thought! What stir, what preparation—vast, profound! While we are stretched in peace, perplexed, disturbed by nought! I LOVE THEE, SURELY. I love thee, surely more and more, Increasing still, increasing fast My feeling's proud and precious store! Crowning the Present with the Past! All my past love is with me still, And fresh devotion's strength beside; When, when shall fate the measure fill?— Never!—the soul and love are wide. The soul for ever more and more, Shall her quick depths of feeling send, And Love, with an exhaustless store— Shall still enrich her without end! Thus ever may I proudly boast A passion still increased, improved— When shall I ever love thee most? Never—yet ever—my Beloved! I SEND THEE SOME FEW FLOWERS. I send thee some few flowers of Spring— Though they must withered be; Each a fair—though faded thing, Ere they are touched by thee. Shall not that gentle touch revive— And bloom and breath restore? Shall they not in thy presence live, And brightly glow once more?— Wouldst thou but breathe upon my Heart, Now faded, dull, and dead— Methinks its cold gloom would depart, New life wake there instead!— No withered flower that ever wore Death's hues and languid mien, Was faded to the very core, As this wrung heart hath been!— But couldst thou breathe upon it now— I feel 'twould live once more— And brighten, with a happier glow, Than e'er it knew before! Revive then thus this withered heart, My wasted life restore— Till breath, and pulse, and soul depart, 'Twill love thee more and more! SWEET BIRD! What say'st thou in thy song, sweet Bird? What say'st thou in thy song?— Thy warblings I have raptured heard— A joyous strain and long. What say'st thou in that thrilling lay, To earth, and sky, and me? Oh! what doth that rich warble say— That free fine minstrelsy? Thou tells't to listening earth and Heaven, How glad a heart is thine— And hints and counsels thou hast given, Oh! happy Bird! to mine! Have I not still heard through thy strain, Glad minstrel of the grove, A tender, yet triumphant vein, Of feeling and of love?— Hath it not taught me—gentle thing! (I conned in joy the task!—) That from our own deep hearts must spring— The Happiness we ask?— Yet knew I not this truth before?— Alas! on earth below, We still must be taught o'er and o'er, Those things that most we know! We need yet more, e'en to be taught, The things we know the best; They die upon the accustomed thought— And sleep in stagnant rest.— They ever need to be recalled Unto our spirit still— By vainer, lighter things enthralled, Which charm it and which fill! Familiar with those great truths grown, Which Nature uttereth forth, We pass them o'er—and seldom own Their wisdom and their worth— We seldom own—weak, thoughtless, vain, Their Presence or their Power— Until they start to view again, In some impressive hour! Haply the least and lightest things— The lowest and the last, May stir once more the stagnant springs— That then gush free and fast! The mote upon the sunny beam, The leaf, the bud, the flower— The moment's ripple on the stream, May speak to us in power! The cloud that floats above the head, The shadows as they start— The very dust beneath our tread May act the teacher's part! And thou for me—oh! little Bird, Hath well that part performed— Who have but now that warble heard, That wakened me and warmed! That wakened every listening thought, Warmed every feeling deep— And mine o'erwearied spirit taught— Sweet stores of peace to reap! Thanks for these lessons of all love!— Oh! wise are they that learn, And in their mild remembrance move— E'en still to these return! We know, we know these things indeed; We knew them long before; The more we know the more we need— To think them o'er and o'er. Dead on our souls they ofttimes lie— Forgotten on our hearts— And all the rich light of their truth From our dull minds departs. We know them—and we know them not— By vainer thought enthrall'd; They are remembered and forgot— Retained—yet not recalled. We thrust them back, we pass them o'er— We overlook them oft— Till some chance voice their reign restore With deep persuasion soft. Thanks, little Bird, for thy dear lay, And lovely minstrelsy; That much to earth and sky did say, And yet much more to me. Thou dost not restless range and rove, To find and forge delight— Thy bliss is in the shadowy grove From morning until night. Thou dost not restless range or rove, New pleasures to devise— Content with liberty and love; And, little Bird, thou 'rt wise.— What Nature gives, thou still dost take, And on her bounty feed— E'en thou dost friend and patron make, From care and trouble freed. All things to thee, all common things, Do minister to bliss— Oh! warbler—for thy free wild wings— And such a life as this! Thy song hath raised within my soul Thoughts I may not let die; There ever shall the echo roll, Of that deep melody. THE HOUR OF SHADOWS. It is the time when shadows play O'er all the earth and sky— They thickly troop about the way, And mock the uncertain eye. It is the time when sounds have ceased, When silence deepeneth on— Unto a breathless hush increased, Awful as thunder's tone! More awful yet than thunder's sound, Or sounds of seas in storm— When they at night, by winds unbound, Writhe like some giant form For in that silence, dread and deep, That inward voice is heard, Which without breath doth swell and sweep— Which speaks without a word.— That still small Voice in our own souls, 'Tis heard in such an hour— Oh! not the volumed thunder rolls With half its thrilling power! It tells us of a thousand things That we may well lament, And home unto our hearts it brings Truths we may well repent. That whisper with its awful thrill, Like the Earthquake's crash of doom, Sounds through our Spirits—as that still Sounds on through Night's thick gloom. It is the time when stars are forth,— A thousand heavenly eyes Are looking down upon this Earth, So dear unto those Skies. These Worlds unto our Worlds may call With deep harmonious voice, And it may answer each and all, And in their joy rejoice! But we—poor worms, that crawl and creep Upon its surface still, Our senses to these concords deep Were never taught to thrill! It is the time when Life and Death Nearest and clearest seem— The one seems like a floating Breath, The other like a Dream! Either to other seemeth still Nearest and dearest now. (Death—surely like a fearful ill No longer threatenest thou!) It is the time when hearts like ours, Forgetting all beside— Own Love's most high and heav'nly powers, With loftiest hopes allied— Then every thought—then all our dreams Grow beautiful with love, As with the moonlight's bright'ning streams The illumined Heavens above. It is the time when deep Delight, And Hope, and Truth, and Peace, Seem mingling all in union bright,— Union that shall not cease! Mingling into one blessedness All dreams, all thoughts above— Their blended name can be no less Than pure, than perfect Love! SONNET. [Would that to love thee better still I knew!] Would that to love thee better still I knew! Oh! this wild Spirit free, do thou controul; Teach, teach it all thine own exalted soul This fiery will thus rule!—this pride subdue, That lends its thoughts a dark and stormy hue— Full oft, when o'er their surging, sea-like roll— Love and its peace should brood to sooth the whole Of that tempestuous Scene—with influence true. Would I could love thee better! every thought Is thine alone, and thine shall ever be. But with unrest and wild, strange trouble fraught— Can these reflect thy pure serenity?— Let my whole mind a nobler mood be taught— Make my whole heart an offering worthier thee! CHILDHOOD'S LAUGHTER. Sweet is happy childhood's laughter, As the voice of dancing streams, As the sound of ringing crystal, As the music heard in dreams! 'Tis their very hearts are singing In that bounding burst of glee— All their very souls are laughing— 'Tis a joy to hear and see. More than warbling o'er the waters Of some clear, fine, thrilling voice— Making air one silvery echo, Doth that sound the heart rejoice. What a freshness of enjoyment Through that pealing laughter breaks! 'Tis the eloquence of Nature— That there exquisitely speaks. Dear are childhood's dancing footsteps, Beating lightly on the ground; Evermore in happy hurry— As some joy were to be found— They go springing on, and bounding, As they trod on very air— Borne on wings of expectation, Free from fetters of dull care!— Not the Spring rains, sparkling brightly, The warm air fast glancing through— Beat the gladdened earth more lightly Than those bounding footsteps to do! They dwell doubting not, nor lingering— Still on some fresh track it starts— That glad child, whose fluttering footsteps, Are like Hope's in our fond hearts! (Oh! no lingering—no abiding— All is hurrying movement still, Like Hope's flight—to whose false presence All our trembling bosoms thrill!) Soon, how soon—shall they be trailing All this world's dire griefs and cares, After them, on their dull progress,— Cheer'd by few inspiring airs! Then, farewell, the fluttering footsteps, Hurrying lightly here and there; And farewell, the ringing laughter— All is changed for doubt and care! THOU KNOWEST NOT THAT I LOVE THEE! Thou know'st not that I love thee, and my heart Is thine, all thine, as it must ever be— And thou, uncaring as unconscious art, Nor seek'st my love's supreme idolatry! Oh! I have told the thrilling stars of night The secrets of its history wildly well, And the wing'd winds upon their rushing flight;— But unto thee—that truth I dare not tell!— Thou know'st not that I love thee, and the love That from my soul upspringeth—sinks again Back on that soul—which it should shine above, Like some clear star—that shineth on the main! The love that should be to thy soul received, Dies back into mine own o'erburthened life!— Oh! from its mountain-weight to be relieved! Oh! to be spared this weariness and strife! Thou know'st not that I love thee, and my breath Is but one prayer—my soul one hope for thee— Ah! but to own in mine hour of death— That earth holds none that mourn or love like me! SONNET. [Fair wert thou as the morning—fair wert thou—] Fair wert thou as the morning—fair wert thou— That with a midnight-gloom of memory deep, Now weigh'st our souls down—since thou'rt fall'n asleep In thy young years of beauty—darkly now Thine image fills our thought, the pale, pale brow— The silent lip, the eye that may not weep— Nor sparkle more, these things long dwelt on steep Our souls in Sorrow, to whose will they bow!— Should these things be?—should thy freed soul but leave Mournings and Shadows—Sufferings, Deaths behind? For many deaths those mourners die, who grieve As those that hope not—and with anguish blind That stroke which freed thy Soul to theirs receive!— Nor lean to loftier thoughts with wiser mind! A THOUGHT IN SPRING. The flowers are laughing round us, And the skies with sunshine stream; Oh! how bright a chain hath bound us In one rich and golden dream. Often obstinate in sorrow, We to-day all comfort spurn; But a beam shines out to-morrow, From whose smile we cannot turn. Oft we shrine a thought, that grieves us, In our hearts to dwell—yet find In some happier hour it leaves us— For hath man a constant mind? For myself, I said, full often, “From Hope's paths will I depart;” But such scenes as these will soften E'en the most determined heart!— And the flowers that now bloom round us, And the skies that shine above— In light chain alike have bound us, In one dream of hope and love. Haply thou too hast in sorrow, Oh! my gentle, gentle friend, Challenged bitterly the morrow— E'en one ray of peace to send. And with head dejected, turning From all hope in that dark hour— Hast remained in tears and mourning, Bound by Sorrow's sternest power! And thyself not thus contenting With the impassioned bursts of woe, Hast still cherished vain lamenting, Studying grief's whole truth to know!— And here we are together— Smiling every care away— In this gladdening summer weather— On this gleaming sunny day! Smiling Memory from us gladly— And rejoicing as we move— As we never, never sadly Wept in broken-hearted love. And this change, oh! whence is't springing, What fair treasures, rich and new, Is our fortune brightly bringing— To lend all things Joy's own hue! What hath wrought this change victorious? What hath chased all gloom away? What achieves this triumph glorious? What hath brought such bliss to-day? Flowers, sweet flowers, that bloom around us, Skies, bright skies, whence Sunshine streams— These have from Grief's yoke unbound us— These have chased Grief's mournful dreams. Funeral dreams and shadowy fancies Fly the joy of Nature's smile— And the bounding life-blood dances, And the heart grows light the while. Lightest things bring purest pleasures— Flowers, and birds, and stream, and breeze; All the world's more splendid treasures Yield small joys compared with these. Strewn with lavish hand for ever, Are the richest blessings round— Asking thus no strong endeavour, They are looked for, and are found! Wheresoe'er we move—they meet us— Crossing still our onward road— E'en unlooked for, oft they greet us, Scattering doubt and gloom abroad! Common things are ever bringing Joys—with freshening dews that fall— Everywhere is gladness springing— Ever—everywhere—for all! Oh! sweet flowers that bloom around us— Sunny skies that shine above— Ye from Grief's yoke have unbound us— Lessoned us in light of love! SONNET. [All my soul trembles, to one hope supreme—] All my soul trembles, to one hope supreme— Say that the planet may forsake the sun, And a fresh course, in rash defiance, run— Say, that the deeply-flowing, murmuring stream Should bear afar its wavy-trembling gleam, And seek its ocean-sepulchre to shun.— Or that this tree, when summer hours are done Should pluck its deep, deep roots from the earth, while teem The skies with shadowings o' the dread tempest's threat, And plant them in the unfixed—uncertain air— Their strong foundations changed for frailest seat— But say not I should every Thought's despair Doom sternly!—these unwinding from that sweet, That mighty Hope, their cherished charge and care! I AM WEARY OF MY THOUGHTS. I am weary of my thoughts, for they In one strain for ever run— I am weary of the heavy thrall, Which I cannot, cannot shun! To the eye that looks but on the ground, And evermore through tears— Though flowery treasures there abound, How gloomy it appears!— It seemeth but a waste of gloom, In the eye to beauty dead— And hollow sounds it, as the tomb, Unto sorrow's heavy tread.— One Grief hath made my thoughts and dreams Ten thousand Griefs and more!— That fair flowed on in joyous streams— Unchained—undimmed before! The shadow of one Thought is thrown Most heavily on all— They have its dull reflection grown, And brook the selfsame thrall. The presence of that mournful thought Hath changed my very soul— A heavy work therein is wrought, Bowed to its dark controul! I am weary of my thoughts, for they In one gloomy tenour run— And make a darkness of the Day, And a shadow of the Sun! REMEMBER ME! Remember me—Oh! give me place In thy true soul for ever!— Then shall I run my mortal race— Wearied—desponding never. I care not though my Life's faint star Mid stormy glooms be shrouded, If thy thoughts of me, Beloved, are Untroubled and unclouded. My true, deep Life 'tis there I live, For me all else seems hollow: If those deep thoughts to the Winds you give— Methinks my Soul must follow! Remember me!—shouldst thou forget, One hope alone could cheer me— The hope that my unsoothed regret Soon to the grave must bear me!— Those who are loved, as thou art loved, They know not what they're doing— When they spurn those thoughts, thrust back, reproved— That still should be pursuing!— In thy deep Heart, oh! give me place, There, there must I be cherished— Or let not Earth retain one trace How I have loved—and perished!— Remember me!—Oh! let me think— While mortal years are flying— We're bound by a perpetual link— Made one by love undying! SONNET. [Oh! fair new Hope! I fain would welcome thee] Oh! fair new Hope! I fain would welcome thee, Even now, with fitting show of glad delight, But so long have I bowed to Sorrow's blight— I know not how, sweet Stranger, worthily To give such welcome! Old thoughts in a sea Of troubled waves will come, in wonted might, And cloud thy triumph, and dispute thy right, And from old trammels I may move not free!— When comes in glory fresh the radiant Spring— Beneath the light of her unclouded skies Then 'twere in sooth a most unworthy thing— To see the arched trees, of the Autumn's obsequies Put on the pomps!—and dead-leaf garlands fling Before her! yet, bright Hope, thus greet I thy new rise! TO THE LOST! Thou'rt sleeping in the quiet grave, Through all my sorrows sleeping; Thou mayst not hear the tempests rave! But how hear'st thou not my weeping? Deaf mayst thou be when thunders speak And this shuddering Earth's replying; But I marvel me thou shouldst not wake At the low sound of my sighing! Thou art resting in thy peaceful home, In a sound, sound sleep reposing— How is't, when I bewail my doom, Thy lids are not unclosing? That sleep is thine, the deep, the chill— From whence is no awaking— Yet, oh! how can thy heart lie still— While mine, e'en now, is breaking? Thou'rt sleeping in thy silent grave, Through all my sorrows sleeping; Thou mayst not hear when tempests rave— Thou shouldst hear my low weeping. Ah! wert thou free, and couldst thou hear, To my faint heart returning, How wouldst thou strive to soothe and cheer, How fondly share its mourning!— So much thou lovedst me—well I know, With my soul to be thus blending, Thou wouldst once more dare mortal woe, Though from heights of bliss descending!— Frail, foolish thought! thy spirit bright, A loftier knowledge shareth; How vile would now be in thy sight, The soul that here despaireth! Earth's little joys and little woes, Its vanities and troubles— Their worthlessness to thee disclose— All, all but breaking bubbles.— Thou know'st for us still chained in clay, Weak heirs of fear and sorrow— It is a moment's flight to-day— Eternity to-morrow!— And shouldst thou not contemn indeed The soul that piled its treasures— In this World—(leaning on a reed,) Slave to its pains and pleasures!— Oh! dear to this unworthy Heart! Beloved—and lovely being; Let me not think that now thou art My shame and weakness seeing! Our failings, our infirmities, Our faults and follies nameless— We call our griefs, and in our eyes Ourselves are pure and blameless! 'Tis our vain wishes—weak desires— And stubborn wrong endeavour, That light within our souls those fires Consuming us for ever!— We struggle still for vainest things, And obstinately languish— Poison our spirit's deepest springs, And call our madness—anguish! We pass by blessings—thankless—blind— Repining and resenting, And bent with loveless, sullen mind, On weak, unwise lamenting!— At once I mark, with shame and pain, My soul's unblest condition— The dull, deep shadow and the stain— With full and fond contrition! Those griefs—which I thus idly named, Were mine own soul's worst failings— My sorrows by myself were framed, Oh! shame on such bewailings!— If all be not by us possessed, Whose charm our eye entrances— We deem we are aggrieved, oppressed— Weak fools of our own fancies!— We nurse the dreams of our distress— And dwell in melancholy— Our weakness is our wretchedness, Our fate—our own vain folly! Our blindness still we make our boast, And boast we're discontented! Those graceless thoughts we cherish most, That should be most repented.— We call on all with us to mourn Crave pity from creation! And our frailty 'tis that plants the thon And our imagination! My sorrows!—by another name For evermore I'll call ye— And seek, in deep remorse and shame, To govern and enthrall ye! My griefs?—my weaknesses! away!— The mask is raised for ever— And I must struggle for the sway, With strong and grave endeavour! THEN THINK OF ME! When shines the morning fair and free, O'er all the earth and sky; Then, loved One, think, oh! think of me, And give that thought, one sigh! Think of me when the fuller hour, Of mid-moon's ripened sway, Bends to the earth each languid flower, Think of me then I pray. And when the soft sweet evening dews— Bring back their freshness, flown, And all the beauty of their hues— Think of me then—mine own! Think of me too when moonlight sleeps, Along the enchanted sea! And glorifies the silenced deeps— Then, then, love, think of me. Think of me when thou dwell'st apart, Then most such thoughts have power— Think of me when alone thou art, Through many a dreamy hour! And when amongst the hurrying crowd, In the abodes of men, When all is restless, glaring, loud!— Think of me then,—e'en then! And when mid Nature's haunts thou stray'st, And hail'st her richest stores; Or mid arts glorious works delayest, Which man's full soul adores;— Think of me—still! yet, oh!—how vain— To say—think thus—or there— Think of me o'er and o'er again— Ever—and everywhere. Think of me as I do of thee, Morn, evening, noon, and night— In crowds—apart—be near to me, From the strong memory bright! Think of me, as I do of thee, Long—deeply—well—until Thy soul thyself appears to be— That one thought-sovereign still!— Think of me—of nought else but me, Who still, where'er I move, Am but one impassioned memory Of thee, and joy, and love! THE DEATH-BELL. 'Tis the Death-bell's echoing toll! From this world hath gone a soul: Do the Dead, without a voice— Now in shrouds and cells rejoice? Do they gladden at that sound— Mouldering, mouldering, in the ground? Shall they welcome him who comes, To the silence of their homes? Oh! the world he leaves behind, Is but thinly, thinly lined, To the world to which he goes— In the under-earth's repose.— Very scanty, in compare, Life's proud, noisy legions are!— The unseen world is peopled most— Here a handful—there a host!— We are some few gathered bands, They are countless as the sands!— As the stars that line the sky— And increase incessantly!— How they crowded are beneath, In the capitals of Death!— Whence none ever may depart; Death, a regal thing thou art!— Couldst thou with thine Army come From the kingdoms of the tomb, Earth were darkened with them then— Though but shadows of dead men. 'Tis the Death-bell's hollow toll; From the world hath gone a soul: Who may guess and who may know, If to endless bliss or woe? None may know—and none may dream— But 'tis floated down the stream— Hark! the death-bell's echoing toll! Earth is widowed of a soul!— 'Tis the Death-bell swinging slow, Aye, the world is widowed now, Of a soul—a conscious soul— Let it mourn in fitting dole.— Little mourning—little woe, Hath the world time to bestow: Let the Dead not blame their lot— They forget—and are forgot! Little mourning—little grief,— Partial these, and light and brief, Hath the world to give her Dead!— She hath living loves instead! Soon their very names are lost— Never by their shadows crossed— Are thy haunts of stir and glee— World—whom they loved foolishly! Weakly did they love thee, World! Till the bolt was sternly hurled At their too-devoted hearts— Then vanished they—as smoke departs! Their possessions and their rights— All their splendours and delights, Dost thou now to others give; Those who laugh, and love, and live.— Never seem thy proud scenes crossed By the shadows of the lost— Thou dost fling them to their fate, As with very scorn or hate. Could they start up from the tomb, From its desolation's gloom, How, with jealous wrath, would they See thou this new rule obey! All that once was theirs alone, They would see profusely thrown At the feet of others then— The new race of living men! All that they so prized and loved Long from their faint grasp removed, Long from them, by death's power riven— They would see to others given. All they must have proved and known, All they boasted as their own, They would see enjoyed, possessed By many another earthly guest!— Children of this later age, Their successors on the stage, They would in possession find Of the treasures they resigned. Hollow World, how vain thou art!— Thou hast an inconstant heart; Faithless art thou—false—untrue— Ever choosing masters new! Masters new thou choosest still, With a never constant will— And rejectest these in turn!— All, thy hollowness shall learn. All shall learn thy hollowness, And thy falsehood's foul excess— Whoso puts in thee his trust Clings to ashes and to dust. Ashes—dust their portion was, Ere they to the grave did pass— Hollow as the grave art thou— Hungry as the Death, e'en now!— Thou a thousand spoils enjoys't, Thou devourest and destroy'st: They that now thy homage claim, Shall soon be nothing or a name. Each new fondly-favoured guest Shall soon be cast out like the rest; Masters new thou still wilt have— Thou dost change incessant crave! Change incessant still thou hast; Much is with the faded past— Left behind for evermore, Much that pleased thee well before. Much that had thy love and praise, The sun's immortal changeless rays, Look down on a world of change, Where all is new, and fresh, and strange.— Oh! ye Dead, could ye arise, Could you now unclose your eyes— Starting from the charnelled urn— Could ye, could ye but return— How, with shudderings, and with sighs, With dismay and stern surprise, Would you view the altered scene, Altered from what it hath been! All ye loved and laboured most To contrive at any cost— All you thought should still remain, Till the end of Time's deep reign, You should find, subverted quite, Buried like yourselves in night; Lost, forgotten—thrust aside:— When ye perished—these things died! When you parted—they were not!— Sharing your dark, heavy lot: All wherein you placed your trust Soon followed you into the dust! There for ever to remain Not to be recall'd again; (Save, if called by others forth— Haply to enjoy their worth!) Then no thought of ye should come, Nor of your former—present doom; With these things no thought of ye; The world hath a brief memory. Oh! ye Dead, could ye arise Could ye open now your eyes— Could ye cast your bonds away, You should shudder with dismay:— You should shudder to behold How, while ye slept in the mould, That false world ye loved so well, All your memory did expel!— Every shadow—every trace— Every record did efface From her proud and busy scene, As though ye had never been! Every trace removed from earth, Of your death, and of your birth— Yet your living souls appeared, To her bosom's love endeared— Yet—when you were living—yet For you seemed suns to rise and set, Gales to breathe—and streams to flow— Trees to fruit—and flowers to blow! Still—when you were living—still Her great heart appeared to thrill In your presence—to your power, Heirs of Life's fast fleeting hour! Nature round, with smile and voice, In that presence did rejoice— And for you the punctual Spring, Brought forth every precious thing!— For you the Earth's embedded mines— Where the sumptuous treasure shines— Gave that glittering treasure forth, All for you their wealth and worth! Then for you was all that is!— For your good—and for your bliss!— Golden harvests teeming round, Loaded then for you the ground— All Earth's treasures, all her stores Which for others now she pours— Were for you—you only then, Ne'er shall they be so again!— Then for you was spread the feast; Each seemed then the favoured guest— All her triumphs then were spread Round your paths—forgotten Dead! All her glory—all her good— Gave she then in liberal mood; Unto you—ye Dead!—and gave— First that glory—then the grave! All her treasures without bound, Scattered in your paths were found; All these treasures of her mine Ye were called on to resign. Ye had joy and ye had power, In your living, conscious hour— Power and joy all snatched away; You were left to your own clay. All the portion of your trust Then might be your own pale dust; And that was mouldering day by day, Withering—vanishing away! All the world's immensity To your footsteps once was free; But when Death became your doom, Cramped and narrow was your home! Cramped and narrow, dark and dull, 'Stead of regions beautiful, With Heaven's glorious dome of sky O'er them proudly stretched on high.— Oh! for ye, in the olden days, Spread the woods o'ershadowing maze— With its lovely vernal dyes, And embowering privacies; And for you the dew's soft shower Fell on herb and tree and flower— In unfailing freshness still— On the valley or the hill! And the springing fountain played, And the welcome cloud delayed— When the Sun's meridian blaze, Was too scorching to the gaze. Aye! for you those brooding clouds Wove their aëry, golden shrouds— When perchance the proud Sun's light Was too burning and too bright; In the sultry Summer's hours, When he scorcheth fields and bowers— In the sultry summer-times, When he burns the parching climes. And for ye, the living things; Filled the air with sound of wings, Or their pasture, peaceful found, On the ever-teeming ground. For you still, the lovely land Did in prospects fair expand— And a thousand scenes of pride Scattered were on every side. Mountains rose, and valleys spread, For ye then—unconscious Dead!— And these charmed your lingering sight, With their beauty and their might. And the great and glorious Sea, As your vassal seemed to be, And your mighty barks rode brave O'er the navigated wave.— Yes! its glorious aid it lent That triumphant element! Unto ye for evermore Stretching, broad, from shore to shore! Wafting far, from clime to clime Treasures radiant and sublime— For your pleasure or your pride, That unfathomable tide! And its murmurings on the shore When the tempest raved no more, Were as grateful to your ear As to us they now appear.— And the sea smells fresh, and deep, Did your senses soothing steep, In a joy as calm and pure As for us doth now endure. Earth, and Sea, and Sky, and Air, With their treasures rich and rare, Seemed for your sole pleasure then, Oh! ye race of silent men! All their splendours, all their shows, In their glory of repose— All the mystery of their change, Ever wonderful and strange;— All that proudly doth appear Spread before us daily here— Nature's more than princely dowers, All her riches—all her powers;— These your mighty portions were— Earth, and Sea, and Sky, and Air, Till your rapid years were told, And ye sank into the mould! Till your brief, brief tale was done, And ye saw no more the Sun— Though he shone as brightly down On the world, whence ye had flown. Till your sand was run, and sped Your short race with winged tread; For how quickly were ye lost— Pale, and still, and breathless Host! Then quickly all things passed from ye, Silent, solemn company!— And with none to shield and save, Sunk ye in the gloomy grave. Then ye, oh! Dead, who from your birth Reigned the lords of all the earth— Ye who ruled, and who enjoyed, Sank into the shadowy void.— Then forgotten was your name: Other generations came, To sit successively upon Your deserted vacant throne! Ye who ruled us from your birth, Then ye abdicated earth— The strength, the sceptre, and the sway, Passed indeed from ye away.— That sway hath passed to other hands; In the wide world's countless lands Nothing of your rule remained, E'en your memory was disdained. Ye from all possessions hurled, Once throned masters of the world, Were in one dark moment thrust From its glory, to its dust! Ye resigned your part and place— The excommunicated race— And exchanged, as all men must, Its dominion for its dust. Never more for ye might smile, Mount, or continent, or isle; Never more for ye might gleam, Sunshine bright on mount or stream. Never more the great sun rise In the illuminated skies— Not a single flashing ray, Pierce the dust of your decay! Never more for you shall bring, Autumn, Winter, Summer, Spring— All their varied stores, sublime— Ye have done with these, and Time! Never more, oh! never more Shall the sea, from shore to shore, Waft proud worlds of wealth for ye— Pale, unconscious company! Never more shall ye admire Pearly moon, or sunset's fire; Nor shall Heaven's rich pageantry Of stain'd clouds charm more your eye!— And all those odoriferous airs, Summer with her treasure bears To the earth's bosom—deep, intense, Never more shall witch your sense! Not the melody of birds— Nor the lowing noise of herds— Nor the insects' happy hum— To your deaf, dull ear can come. Yea! ye are indeed dethroned, And your empire is disowned, By the hollow-hearted earth, Loving still her latest birth!— All forgetful of the past— Loving but the latest—last— Turning ever from the old, To the new to cling and hold! From her memory bent to efface, Every shadow, every trace, Of the past and of the dead, To the living, bound instead.— But 'tis well—'tis surely well! And the Dead who silent dwell, Hersed in mould—beneath earth's floor— Should remembered be no more!— Weary were it did the earth Give us mourning stead of mirth— Greet her new-born but with tears, Shed for those of other years.— Gloomy were it—did she turn From her present, still to yearn For her lost and buried past— And those from her dominion cast.— Mournful—were she, sadly bent Still to languish and lament For all that she hath darkly lost— By ten thousand shadows cross'd! Cross'd by thousand shadows still, Till the wood and till the hill Should a heavy aspect wear, And a weight of sadness bear! And the moss-banks and the stream, E'en the sun's transcendant beam, Should in sorrow faintly own A strange gloom around them thrown. O'er the dew-drop and the leaf, Then should brood a dream of grief— O'er the herb and o'er the flower, The universal cloud should lower! Death his mighty, mighty wings, Should then close around all things— Widely—fearfully unfurled, O'er the life of the whole world! Life, in sooth, should cower beneath The presence of the o'ermastering Death— Raised to still more awful height, Dowered with yet more awful might! Life itself, the fleeting breath, Should seem the Shadow of the Death!— Did Creation thus confer On him those gifts it owes to her!— Did this Earth for evermore At his gloomy shrine adore— To his service consecrate All she hath of fair and great;— Did she dedicate to him— The ruthless spoiler—gaunt and grim— All her pomps and treasures fair, And his yoke of mourning bear;— Did she still lamenting grieve, And no comfort's balm receive— For Her vanished myriads lost, Cherishing their memory most!— Weeping for the myriads flown, As though she were left alone— In bereavement's heavy state, Lorn, and sad, and desolate— As though she were left alone Weeping for those myriads flown; While still around, of living forms, Crowd the innumerable swarms. While thousands, thousands throng the way, Hailing still the rising day— Blessing still the smiling sun, Smiling their fair homes upon:— On their happy haunts and homes, Their cities proud with towering domes— Their hamlets free with cabins low, For all the joy of sunshine know! All exult in those bright beams Lighting up the hills and streams— The vernal woods—the teeming plains, All are chained with golden chains! 'Tis the Death-bell's echoing toll, Earth is widowed of a Soul!— One of myriads now is lost— One is gained to the endless host. Earth shall mourn not for her dead; She hath living loves instead: Evermore a widow-bride— Dead and Living, at her side!— She hath ever lost and found!— With her marriage-garlands crowned Her dark funeral veil beneath!— Widow-bride of Life and Death! Little recks she of the lost— Leans she towards the found the most— Seated at her marriage-feast, Never hath the joyaunce ceased. Burial followeth bridal close; She may love, but she must lose— What of that? fresh thousands start, Claiming share of her proud heart.— 'Tis one bridal-burial feast, But stills owns she love increased— For the generation new, To that living bridegroom true!— Turning from her lords of old, That stark race—the pale and cold— Veiled and vanished from her view All her love is for the new! All her love for us is now, And she wears a smiling brow— Us to welcome and to greet— Nor waileth o'er the winding-sheet! Oh! for us she brightly spreads Her rich dyed carpet, whereon treads Lightsome foot of joy and hope— She droops not, nor may we droop!— And for us she clusters round Shining treasures without bound; All our paths she strews with flowers— Her heart is free—then why not ours? And for us—for us alone— Are her pomps and glories shown; All her triumphs and delights, Through sunn'd days and starry nights. Morn and evening—night and day, Shows her decked in rich array, Us to charm and us to please, Soul to soothe—and sense to seize. Us to charm and us to win, Through Life's hurry, strife, and din, Doth the Earth all hues assume Of triumphal, festal bloom!— Oh! ye Parted Ones!—ye Dead!— Not for you her smiles are shed— But those smiles ye may not heed— Rapt away—for ever freed!— Freed from every chain of care— Breathing new, immortal air; Freed from every tie of dust, Ye may scorn her now—ye must! Ye have looked on lovelier flowers; Ye have dwelt in brighter bowers; Ye have hailed a heav'n more bright— If ye lived and died aright! Ye have fairer things beheld— Than e'en the lilies of her field; Fairer still than Summer's rose— Which in burning beauty glows. Dull her mountain-springs must be, Near those fountains, gushing free, Which with day-like dazzling burst, Flow to quench your spirit-thirst!— Dark, indeed, her smiles to those Which now light your fair repose; Cold her triumphs and her glee To your joy's intensity. Poor, indeed, the precious things Which this Earth as offerings brings— To the costlier treasures there, Marvellously rich and rare! Weak, indeed, her strength, her might, Now in your enlightened sight— Frail her power and false her pride, With her change of time and tide. Happy—happier ye, by far, Than your vain successors are— Basking in her beauty here— Holding her, alas! too dear. Many deaths in life they die, Who cling with too much constancy To this Earth, in love and pride— With all her change of time and tide. Many things they see depart, To which they had bound their heart; These they see depart—decline— And reluctantly resign— This chills the pulse—and checks the breath, Then they know the touch of Death; Then Death's freezing touch they know, And besides—worlds, worlds of woe!— Hark! that Death-bell's echoing toll, World! thou'rt widowed of a Soul!— Soul! from pains and troubles free, Thou'rt wedded to—the Eternity! THE WORLD OF NATURE. Away from heartless revelries Unto Nature's pageants calm! Repose 'twill be for dazzled eyes— For the wounded Spirit, balm! In the deep violet-dingles, lone— In the haunts of bird and bee, And by the rill—the mossy stone— Would I seek tranquillity!— And though Storms of wrath went thundering past, In these haunts—the lone and proud— No fear should ride upon the blast— And no gloom upon the cloud! So light and dreadless should they seem, Compared with those that shake With fiery breath and tempest-dream, The heart that pants to break. That heart the World, the false, foul World, Hath wronged with mortal wrong, 'Gainst which its thunderbolts were hurled, And its armed array was strong! Where that World's persecutions cease, And where escape the oppress'd— All must appear as golden peace— And as happiness and rest! Still Nature's storms seem mild and bland By these, the fiercer far, That rouse up at their stern command All the Soul to one wild war! The thunder-pealings—crash on crash— That crowd their echoing shocks, And the mountain-waves that roaring dash 'Gainst the iron-fronted rocks— Are tame and weak, compared with strife, In the Being's inmost deep— With the wild storms of tempestuous life— Storms that there their revels keep! Away from seeming show of mirth— And inward deep despair— If one lone spot be left on Earth, Oh! but bear me there—even there! The World of Nature shall restore The peace that long since fled!— Shall bring Hope's starry smile once more, And shall banish doubts and dread! The World of Nature shall repair That havoc and that waste Which wronged a Spirit, mid the glare Of Man's fiery Life misplaced. World!—Earthly World of Nature bright!— If thou, thus with influence true, Canst bless the Soul with such deep might— Oh! what must the Heavenly do? A FABLE. It chanced a long, long time ago, Longer indeed than I well know, That there was met a company, Right friendly all, and fair, and free, A most respectable society, Assembled in all due sobriety; They met—and kindly greetings then Exchanged, as you may see 'mongst men— For men they were not,—nor laid claim To so high title—such proud name.— No!—they were of the tribes that we, Scornful, in superiority, Call brutes, and animals, and creatures— Because they wear not human features; And, holding in light estimation, Name—lower orders of creation.— It was a long, long time ago, Longer than I can tell or know, That some of these assembled were, On a fine Summer's day and fair— To chat—and their opinions state, On themes of more and of less weight— 'Twas long ere rail-roads, stiff and straight, Ran rigidly their iron line Along, and threatened the decline Of coach-proprietors and posters— (Steam! arrantest of vapoury boasters! How, how dost thou at once declare That our most solid good is air, Or smoke, or water!—thee in short— And how we trust to this report!) Also of Nature's pride and grace, Which they contrive too much to efface— Do these still threaten the overflow, And frightful make our world below.— 'Twas long before gas turned the night To something more than mid-noon bright, And challenged yon proud Lord of Day, To reign with as triumphant sway— (While pale Hecate, quite put to shame— Still fostering her too-faithful flame, Seems now, like wisp-lights in a swamp— A supernumerary lamp— And that too fed with oil—in short— One of the antiquated sort— Exploded now on every side, Through changes vast of time and tide— And the poor stars, how might they bear Their dazzling rival, fine and fair. But ill, in sooth!—for they appear That glaring, dazzling rival near, Most like—while more and more they fail— Ghosts of departed rushlights, pale!) 'Twas long before mild revolutions Brought forth sweet baby-constitutions— A little ricketty or so— As, to their cost, their nurses know; Yet, on the whole, that promise well, Tickled with coral, toy, and bell! Unless the multitude of teachers Should overdo the pretty creatures, O'er-tasked, and troubled, or yet worse, Unless they should be changed at nurse— And in the place of those that were Free, liberal, smiling, broad and fair— Should start up—cast in sterner mould— Dark Despotisms, strong and bold, Armed—thriving—scowling, fierce, and strong, Driving in trembling haste along, All all before them with their nod, Changing the rattle for the rod, Coral and toy, for thong and chain, And blackened with the old barbarous stain— 'Twas long before such things were known, Things which now every day are shown— That this fair company, and free, Assembled were harmoniously. There did a staid Owl gravely blink— Looking as 'twould be thought to think— Full solemnly and wisely too— As many emptier bipeds do— Who put reflection's sage look on, And think the business thus is done! And there a noble Eagle gazed Around, as if almost amazed, To be upon the earth—so far From his own worshipp'd sun's proud car; And there a little quiet Mole, With shining coat as black as coal, Sat looking pensively demure— In earth-born dream, we may be sure— Deep, dark, and hidden, and profound— For all his soul is underground!— A Dormouse too—but come, a truce, To preface long of little use— Let us at once report what they Did on this same occasion say.— These, and yet many another too, After the first kind how-d'ye do, Had passed between them, straight began To chatter and converse, like man, On topics divers—and discuss Full many subjects, until thus The Dormouse eloquently speaks, The rest their muzzles close, and beaks; They speak no more on topics divers, While his wise mind he thus delivers:— “How foolish men must surely be!— Pity they do not learn of me. How weak it is for young and old, Alike to bide the Winter's cold: And troth, my friends, I needs must say That ye're almost as weak as they; Almost as weak as they are, sure, Since you too are content to endure (Or most of you, at least) the pangs— Planted by Winter's icy fangs— When ye have nothing else to do, But sleep the whole dull winter through, Curled in a comfortable ball— Not conscious of the cold at all! Dreaming of Spring and Summer bright, Treating the Winter like a night!— In vain the tempest's wing should flap O'er ye, once nestled in snug nap— The piercing frosts—the chilling snows Should harm ye not in your repose.— Last Winter, by my friends I'm told, Was bitter, bleak, and biting cold— I nothing of its terrors knew, But soundly slept the season through!— While thus I slumber, snug and lone, I have a climate of my own; The changeful weather is for me Fettered and fixed unchangeably, Immutable—invariable,— While I in lap of quiet dwell— The inconstant winds for me remai Together bound, in one soft chain— East, west, south, north, are all the same To me, in that long peaceful dream; To me doth seem, in very truth, The north like the dew-dropping south; The keen east like the balmy west— Since none disturb my happy rest; A season and a climate fair Ever have I to mine own share!— To every dear and worthy friend A self-same course I recommend For folly it must be to endure Ills that so easy are to cure.” He ceased—and those assembled round, Awhile remained in silence bound; But soon another voice began— And thus the strain mellifluous ran— The little silky, dusky Mole, Thus poured his subterraneous soul!— (And shy, yet sly he looked the while, And smiled a twinkling darkling smile—) “Excuse me, gentle Dormouse, dear, With much surprise your speech I hear; If they indeed like me would do, Then they would sapient be, 'tis true, Nor on earth's surface still remain, To freeze on the unprotected plain, Exposed to stern vicissitude Of varying weather, rough and rude. My subterraneous galleries are (Scooped out with persevering care) Snug, warm, delightful—when the snow Is white above—there's none below. How can you all indeed be still, Content with stupid, senseless will, To walk about, unroofed—exposed, —In no delicious mound enclosed,— To wind and weather, snow and sun, Nor take the surest means to shun. Thus you would 'scape the Winter's cold, But not in senseless slumber rolled; Unconscious and uncaring all, Unknowing of what may befall.— How I enjoy the thought, how well, Thus screened in my clay citadel, I can withstand old Winter's power, And mock him from my mould-built tower: I joy the howling gales to hear, To me they bring no pangs of fear; They may not roughly breathe on me, I hear their fierce threats dauntlessly; The snows may fall in thickest showers, And whiten all the leafless bowers; They serve to warm me, where I dwell— In my own little quiet cell.”— “Well,” cried the solemn, blinking Owl, (Respectable and worthy fowl!) “I do not doubt—dear little Mole— That your discourse is, on the whole, Full of sage counsel; and, I own, I always think that you have shown Much owl-like wisdom in your choice (Wherein, believe me, I rejoice) Of a dark dwelling, where no ray Of blinding sunshine comes to play— I do not doubt you're in the right— Like me, a foe to blazing light— But how Man can (the strange, odd creature, With ass-like bray, and ape-like feature, Who e'er heard Man's loud laugh without Thinking that Asses then sang out?) Before the calm and cloudy Night (That soothes so much the undazzled sight) Prefer the glaring, staring Day Astounds me more than I can say! And ye, my friends, Horse, Sheep, and Cow, And others, too, that I see now! How can ye be so very weak As not some shelter then to seek, When glows the Sun with fearful blaze Of blinding and of painful rays— And venture from your calm retreats, (Whether where bough of verdure meets With bough, to form a sheltering skreen, Compact and close, of soothing green; Or where the hand of Man hath reared Sheds—by long habit's force endeared— For your retirement and repose, Where Sun shines not, nor wild wind blows?—) Into the open air, alone— When gleams the gentle Lady Moon— Then is the time for true delight, In the still gloom of gracious Night, When no fierce, gaudy blaze is seen, Troubling with restless radiance keen, Wildering with fiery glow intense The dazzled and distracted sense: For wise are they who ever shun The burning, blinding, blazing Sun.”— “Away!” the noble Eagle cries, And lifts his bright and kindling eyes, And flaps his mighty wings of pride, Resounding loud, and spreading wide, As though his inmost Spirit yearned To reach that Sun which cheerly burned Above them, beautiful and bright, Fount of an ocean-flood of light!— “Away—away!—how dare ye thus Accuse yon proud orb, luminous?— Good neighbour Owl!—your strange advice Let Dormice follow in a trice— And Bats, and things of sullen brood, That own a vile and abject mood— Moles, Grubs, and Snails, and twisting Worms, And all those poor and petty forms Which seem superfluous, to infest Earth's teeming and maternal breast— Let all whose hearts and hopes throb high Soar up with me into the Sky!— Let all who would dull languour shun Mount up with me and greet the Sun! I marvel much so many prove Content on humble Earth to move, And groundwards turn their leaden eyes, That should be fixed upon the Skies, And turn their heavy orbs away From him on golden throne of day Who sits triumphant and sublime, Lord of each Season and each Clime, The Source of Beauty, Hope, Delight— Of all that joyous is, or bright, The Chief of Stars, the Crown of Space, Who gilds Creation's smiling face, The great, good, glorious, gracious Sun, From whence all weal, all wealth is won!”— The Eagle ceased: his piercing tone Might well have struck a heart of stone: Defiance and disdain were there— 'Twas like a battle-cry in air!— It seemed to startle and to stun, E'en like a voice sent from the Sun! A muttered murmur round confessed What echoes swelled in many a breast, To these proud accents, fierce and free, That long resounded thrillingly.— This trembling murmur melted then To silence' solemn hush again, And soon a very different sound The attention claimed of those around. A dull and drowsy voice was heard— While laboured—lingering—lengthened word (Whose every syllable, in drawl Long-drawn—appeared to creep and crawl) Spoke forth, by slow and dull degrees, What wandering mind might never seize— The meaning of that speaker!—who Now sought to win, with counsel new. Each slow, dull accent seemed to fall Like drops in some deep cavern-hall— To sink in Silence' depths again, Like leaden plummets in the main!— No marvel, since the Snail 'twas then That spoke from out her shelly den; Just putting forth, for all to see, Her horns and head, suspiciously. And thus she spoke, while all remained In mute surprise transfixed and chained; For seldom did the slow Snail take The trouble thus a speech to make:— “The lordly Eagle seems to scorn All who may happen to be born, Unlike himself, of low estate, And proudly, proudly doth he prate. But I do verily opine— (I pray you all your ears to incline) That great advantages are found In calmly dwelling on the ground; Conspicuous as he soars on high, His proud form traced out on the sky, He tempts the skilful marksman's aim, Whose arrow can his courage tame; And while he haunts the realms above, Few friends finds he to trust and love: He hath a lonely place on high, A dreary solitude of sky! For solitude is sad and drear, E'en though the path of our career Be through the sunny regions there— What place of banishment is fair?— For me, I bless my humble birth, And am right happy on the earth. All that I want or wish I have, And now would your attention crave; Because I think I could improve The state of those dear friends I love! Would all example take from me, Methinks that all would happier be. Lo! I am evermore at home, Not only when I rest—but roam; Where'er I go, you know 'tis true, My home and hearth go with me too! Those who no bliss, no peace would lack, Like me should bear upon their back Their house, with all its furniture, So should their comforts still endure. Man, the proud lord—Earth's haughty king, Who seems to deem that every thing Is made for him and him alone— The sun his lamp—the world his throne, The starry and resplendent sky His star-o'erbroidered canopy— Trembles, when from his home afar, Lest thieves should wrong and foes should mar.— What housebreakers would dare to attack The house when on the owner's back? 'Twere bungling burglary indeed, And scarcely to success could lead!— And then, besides, full well he fares Who hath no multitude of cares:— My roof and raiment are the same, And little care or toil they claim.— My raiment and my roof are one, Unbuilt, unpainted, and unspun.— No choice I have—no change I need; A calm, contented life I lead: No strangers do I ask to come, To visit me in my dear home; Since there can be no room for these, Though I therein still dwell at ease— Nor friends nor foes can there intrude, And yet is mine no solitude! I only have to put my head Just out of doors, with air well bred, To wish good morning to my friends, And thus my brief retirement ends. At once can I of surety be In midst of gay society!— Grub, Toad, and brother Snail are there, And all to greet their friend prepare; And Mole and Field-mouse too I meet At times, and do right-loving greet!— In short, a pleasant life I lead, And deeply do I wish, indeed, That all would follow in my train, They should not find it were in vain— 'Tis most delightful to combine— (As I unvaryingly entwine)— Domestic duties deep and true, With friendly free relations too. None may encroach, and none intrude Upon my peaceful solitude; And yet in midst of all I dwell Secure within my sheltering shell. I never leave my house, but still My situation change at will. To adopt this same course I advise All who their peace and comfort prize; From lordly Man to lowly Mole, Crouched in his subterraneous hole.” The Snail had nothing more to say— Died, drawling, drowsily away The droning accents—sluggish—slow, As frozen in their lazy flow:— The Dormouse thought 'twas Winter come; That long speech shed a chill, a gloom, So dismal and so deep around, And in such heavy fetters bound The wearied sense—he could not keep His eyes unclosed, and fell asleep.— Nor yet, the whole truth to declare, Was he the only slumberer there; For various snores, from divers snouts, Precluded on that head all doubts: But when that drowsy drawl was done, They 'gan to wake up one by one— The Owl began to blink and stare, With his round orbs, a solemn pair; The Eagle's eyes flashed open wide, And brightly glanced from side to side. The Mole, and sundry others too, That well had dozed that long speech through, Then shook and roused themselves, and tried To look as though they had applied Their minds most earnestly to all That did from Snail's lips lately fall— But none might make reply, because None well had heard: an awkward pause Among the assembly then took place, Yet lasted but a little space:— The Swallow, blythe, and bold, and free— Twittered a speech forth joyously, And cheerily took up the strain:— “'Twere best to follow o'er the main, (As I for ever wisely do, Who one unchanging course pursue!) The blushful Summer, bright and glad, In roses and in sunbeams clad; Not like the dusky tribe of Moles— To hide oneself in gloomy holes, For sake of warmth and of repose, While cold the wind inclement blows— Nor like the Dormouse to remain, Bound in dull slumber's close-link'd chain; Till Summer, ever fair and free, Returneth o'er the main with me! But still to keep her smile in view, To track her sweet steps, and pursue, And where she goeth, swift to go; Where her new hoards of roses blow— 'Tis best to hail her evermore, And follow her from shore to shore; Not, like the lazy Snail, to keep Your house and bed, and slow to creep, Perhaps some inches in the day, Then think you've journeyed a long way. Dear, slimy friend! pray pardon me, For somewhat harshly blaming thee! But sure, a little while ago, When you were speaking very slow, I caught some words of your's most queer, That counselled all your friends to appear With their strong houses on their backs— Tight-fitting them as close as wax. Doubtless you suffer much from cold— Since you're content thus to enfold In cloistering case your graceful form— It must be, sure, to keep you warm: Far better 'twere to cast away That cumbering case, methinks some day; And also, if your slimeship could, Your sluggishness and slothful mood— And follow—airily and free— Summer and Swallow o'er the sea! 'Twould painful be at first—sweet Snail! But perseverance should prevail— Which still success for ever brings— And thus, although you have no wings, You o'er the sea might swim or float, Or haply borrow his light boat From the Ocean-child, the Nautilus, Who, doubtless, would oblige you thus, And you would feel at home and well, No doubt—enveloped in his shell Not like the Eagle would I soar To heights that must be evermore Glaring and comfortless indeed; I should shoot down from these with speed! 'Twere better not, in place of pride, Thus lost and lonely to abide:— And then, beside, we all must know, The nearer to the sun we go The colder grows the bright, keen air, O'er-rarified and sharpened there.— 'Tis well most careful court to pay Unto the radiant Lord of Day; 'Tis well to pay most careful court Unto the Sun, and to resort For ever to his chosen place, And gaze upon his glorious face; But not with vain ambition, weak, His throne in upper air to seek. Vainly they struggle—vainly strive, Who seek at such heights thus to arrive! Still, still above them, far above, Doth he their poor attempts reprove; Not near enough unto his blaze To feel the increased warmth of the rays, They only find the upper air More keen, and chill, and piercing there, In that blue, open world of sky, Spread out so smilingly on high! 'Tis better, better far to chase, On sea and land, from place to place, The golden sun of Summer's hours— Where'er he lights the blushing bowers (That break, in continent and isle, Into rich bloom beneath his smile!) And not to seek those heights to gain, But lightly o'er the sunny plain To skim, in glad and free delight— While all beneath—above, is bright— Verdure and flowery sheen below, Rich with a variegated glow. Above—one cloudless azure, fair; Around—one gleaming world of air; 'Tis then we own Creation's worth, At once enjoying heaven and earth! Let all these strive to copy me, If they would know felicity!— And follow in my happy train, Chasing the summer o'er the main, Tracking the sun, and following far His rolling and resplendent car.” Thus chattered they—and all the while Heard, with a staid and serious smile, A fine, sagacious Dog—that near Remained, their mixed discourse to hear: And now he in his turn addressed, Snail, Swallow, Eagle, and the rest; Thus took he up the mixed discourse, And the argument unto its source, Appeared to trace with sounder sense Than those, with all their eloquence. Thus spoke the Dog, while all around Listened in silence most profound— “Dear Friends!—I heard my master say, Unto a neighbour, t'other day, How carefully, on every side, Doth Nature for her Sons provide! Look at the cameleopard's neck, Lengthened to reach the boughs that deck The fair trees of its native land, Which shooting high, in air expand, Since on those green and tender boughs The cameleopard loves to browse. Behold the active, busy bees— Instructed nicely how to seize The sweets from ev'ry fragrant flower— Converting them, with mystic power, Into delicious food, which none But them can frame beneath the sun. Observe the Spider, taught to spread His slight attenuated thread, In rare and complicated way, Adapted best to catch his prey; Or to the artful silkworm turn, How from the first doth it well learn To weave that costly web so fine— Which doth with glossy lustres shine! All are enriched with precious dowers, Provided with surpassing powers— And on their destined paths are led, And on their course appointed sped; Furnished with means and methods still, Their different fortunes to fulfil. None on the other's paths encroach, None may his brother's acts reproach— All are the needful lessons taught, And to perfection's fullness brought— Much more did my sage master say, Upon this topic the other day, Conversing with a friend, who seemed To deem just as my master deemed; And unto me they made it clear, That all is perfect wisdom here; That all doth surely firmly blend Unto a great and gracious end. Friends, it appeareth unto me, If I indeed may make so free, Ye all talked nonsense to each other, Much like my braying, long-eared brother. Each hath, according to his kind, His own peculiar part assigned; Nor hath Dame Nature e'er forgot To adapt his means unto his lot. That which doth make the happiness Of one would scarce the other bless.— The Snail, slow creeping on the ground, The secret of her bliss hath found; As happy is she in her shell As the Eagle, whose proud heart doth swell With bold ambition, keen and high, Soaring into the sun-bright sky. The Dormouse, that doth punctual keep The sabbath of his wintry sleep, Enjoyeth life as much as those Whose eyes to greet the day unclose, Though every season duly still, Not from their choice, in sooth, or skill. The Mole—the little dusky Mole, Within his subterraneous hole— Hath all his world concentered there— Hath little need of space and air!— And my good friends, be very sure, As long as this world doth endure, Things will go on as they have done, For nothing's new beneath the sun; And none amongst ye could improve, (I speak in friendship still, and love) Howe'er ye dream, in vain conceit, Still apt with ignorance to meet The state and habits of the rest; Since all is ordered for the best, And every one of you must keep His clear-traced path—nor may o'erleap The bars which mark out and divide His race from all the world beside;— And could he—then he would but gain Trouble and weariness and pain.— Your tastes are different, and your joys, What charms the one, the other cloys— Of that one the best balm and bliss Proves but the bitter bane of this; For tastes and tempers ne'er may be All reconciled and made to agree:— The wisdom of the one is shown And this full oft on earth is known To be the other's foolishness. These truths I would on all impress:— In short, dear Friends—I well believe, We all from Nature's hand receive The boons best suited to us still, Though good be sometimes dashed with ill!— We all should be contented here— To that sweet nursing mother, dear!— Dear to kind nature evermore, Who feedeth all from her rich store!— E'en from the loftiest to the least, Fish, fowl, and insect, reptile, beast; Man, lordly Man, who reigns supreme, And the least midge in Summer's beam! She doth an equal care bestow, Around—beside—above—below!— The curtain of the mighty deep Hides not from eyes that never sleep: The wants of myriad creatures there, To each and all she gives their share, For each and all with care provides— Those countless swarms that throng the tides;— And from the first unto the last, All have their lot by wisdom cast; Their portion and their part assigned, Bound by strict ties none e'er unbind. All classes of all creatures she, Doth ever bless with bounty free— Unto their cry she still attends, And her kind ear attentive bends To all their supplications still, And doth their just desires fulfil— And be ye sure that happiness All in their lot and line possess.— The humblest Slug that seems to crawl, As though he had no life at all. Enjoys as much in that faint life, Unknown to wild excitement's strife, As the proud Panther in his hours Of bounding triumph, loftiest powers.— Take all and each, what Nature gives: In comfort and in peace he lives Who looketh and who seeketh not Beyond his own established lot; Who hangs on her supporting hand, Nor wishes by himself to stand, In rash vain independence here, Unchastened by a wiser fear— Nor dares with envious glance to turn, For other's good or gifts to yearn.— Each doth she still endow and bless With different kinds of happiness: But happiness it still must be— Profusion of felicity.— Here ever more exhaustless streams— And ever with abundance teems— Though each may think it is but found In his own circle's narrow bound!” MORAL. Man thus still deems that Worth's and Wisdom's fruits Alone can grow from his own fixed pursuits; Forgetting characters and qualities For ever differ, like the rainbow's dyes; And deems his brother obstinate and vain, If still he thinks his own path straight and plain. Man! then would'st teach and counsel still thy friend, Thine own true weal dost thou well comprehend. COUNTY HUGH. “Oh! gentle, gentlest Ladye May, Come forth with radiant smile, Teach a new glory to the day, Replenished—crowned—the while! Those darkest eyes of thine, fair May, Are imaged in my soul; My peace—my joy—my strength away— How ruthlessly they stole! Those darkest eyes are brighter far Than sky-born splendours be!— My soul confesseth to no star, But those thine eyes show me. Suns of the Sun!—they brighten earth, And make it paradise! Those stars are shamed things, whose birth Is in yon distant skies! Oh! gentle, gentlest Ladye May, Come forth—with smile or frown, For all things frown while thou'rt away, Mine only love and own!” So sang the County Hugh, beneath The eaves of Ladye May; And she believed his flattering breath, And gave her soul away! At the proud masque—the banquet gay, The lordly chase of deer, The gentle heart of Ladye May Fluttered with love's fond fear. At midnight festival, or where The tournament took place— Now pallid looked that maiden fair— Now showed a blushing face. For oft—although fond word and vow He breathed in ardent tone, She deemed, from altered eye and brow, His love had fainter grown. A year—a little year had passed— And half her bloom away With this had flown, for care's keen blast Had blown on Ladye May. One year—one little year had passed, Her cousin's chamber near She visited, and heard, aghast, A voice too deeply dear. “Oh! lovely Ladye Geraldine, No eyes are like thine eyes; No beauty may compare with thine: List!—'tis a lover sighs! My fair and fairest Geraldine, Sole Ladye of my love; But whisper, whisper thou 'lt be mine— Nor love's wild zeal reprove! Let, let me hear thy voice' sweet sound, And see thine eyes of light— For, oh! 'twere bliss, e'en past all bound— To perish in thy sight!” Long had she doubted—long had feared, Through the o'erclouded past— Yet doubts and anguish but endeared That Lover—lost at last. From agony to agony She slow had travelled on; Now nought was left her but to die, Heart struck—heart-crushed, undone! From agony to agony She slow had journeyed still; Now to the goal must she draw nigh Of dark Despair's stern ill. The County Hugh, impatient grown, Renewed his flattering strain, And yet in more impassioned tone Implored and urged again! In more impassioned tone he prayed His ladye love to hear, And fond appeal beseeching made To win her gentle ear. “Oh! dark-eyed Ladye Geraldine, Thee only I adore! No charms e'er touched my Soul but thine— I never loved before! Faithful, unwittingly to these, (As with prophetic heart!) Ere thee I saw—since none could please— I dwelt in dreams apart!— Fear'st thou that I could ever change? No more such fears avow!— He who before might never range Shall scarce prove faithless now! Oh! gentlest Ladye Geraldine, My life's sweet Sovran be!— No charms e'er touched my Soul but thine, I never loved but thee!” He raised his high and lordly brow, Which cap and panache wore; That lovely form of beauty, now, Shall he behold once more? He gazes up with longing eyes— To that dear casement still— He holds his breath—he checks his sighs— She must come forth!—she will! A white hand, trembling, draws aside The gold-fringed curtain, fair— His Geraldine—his joy—his pride— His ladye love is there!— Surely his ladye love so bright Is there in Beauty's pride!— That little, trembling hand so white Draws the silk folds aside!— He looks for that bright cheek of bloom, Of roseate sheen and fair;— He sees a Vision of the Tomb, A shadowy Vision there!— A wan, and white, and wasted cheek, A hollow, haggard eye, A lip unflushed by scarlet streak, Did Count Hugh descry! A drooping, drooping form, and frail, Some killing Sorrow's prey— Oh! 'twas the changed, and chill, and pale— Heart-broken Ladye May! LINES FROM “INEZ.” (A MS. POEM.) Now o'er my thoughts shines many a phantasy, Dazzling my Soul—myself away from me! Few days have passed since Love's strange, fearful spell (Felt too intensely and obeyed too well) Changed all my being—Love's quick spell of power, That works dark wonders in one burning hour, Makes moments teem with alterations deep, (Till our past life appears one frozen sleep!)— And pours in light o'er unknown Worlds of Soul— Till like Creation, life runs through the whole!— What is this sentence of a mystic doom?— I am not what I was—such change hath come Upon my living Spirit deeply now, That doth the might of that quick spell avow: It springs as though from depths of barren gloom, It starts and bounds as from the murky tomb— The dull, deep tomb of Cold Indifference called, Where long it lay with clouds and shadows palled!— I am not what I was—but yet—but yet— The Past's lost peace I covet and regret. Indifference! thee would I yet ask—yet crave— Though now shouldst thou seem colder than the grave, Heavier than mountains—darker than the night? Contented with the excess of life and light, Which Love—deep Love, with might o'erpowering brings, Upon his sudden—sweeping, lightning wings. I am not what I was; deep change doth fall O'er mine existence, and my being all— Aims, objects, interests, trusts, resources, powers, Beliefs and feelings—in these few full hours All, all are altered—all my soul is wrought Into one mighty and absorbing thought!— One thought! Even so! for thoughts, hopes, fancies, dreams, All mingle now, like overflowing streams, Into one flood, that doth—in deluge deep— The horizon-bound of consciousness o'ersweep.— I know not all I feel, nor yet am made, Brought suddenly to noon's full light, from shade; The master of mine own new heart and mind, But stumble, as with over-gazing blind; My very self is dazzled now from me, And nothing, nothing, is distinct—but thee. I schemed before, I planned, willed, thought, and dreamed; But now,—(and brief the interval hath seemed) Thou plann'st, and will'st, and workest within my soul, And no volition's mine and no controul. I know not what it now may be to care— For aught thou dost not bring, thou dost not share! All marks of independent soul and mind Are merged—razed—lost—and what to leave behind? A trace, a faint, faint trace—a trembling shade, And that, even that, appears to fleet and fade— And even that fleeting shade and fading trace, That passion's earthquake-footsteps fast efface, Aye! even that trace, that shade are not of me. But, oh! thou discreating Power!—of thee! I love thee! but I hate the crushing thrall, The fear—the unrest—Love's tyrannous bondage all. I love! and hate the love that makes my soul Slave to a stranger influence and controul, That robs me thus (while all things grow a doubt) Even of the world within—and world without! SONNET. [Man still half makes himself—still but half made—] Man still half makes himself—still but half made— Right glorious privilege and proud—to crown And to complete with labours of his own The august, great work—through Heaven's still-prospering aid, And climb to Soul-Creation!—full-arrayed With powers sublime—strength in his weakness shown, Permitted, through his Maker's grace showered down, To meet his Maker's will—in light displayed! Lo!—where himself he hath not stirred and striven— Content in Apathy's dull paths to plod— Sink, frustrated the high designs of Heaven!— His seems a world-wide grave above the sod!— Half to create himself to him 'tis given— For Heaven hath made a Man—that Man may make a God! HUMAN JUDGMENTS. There are bright stars on the midnight, That all softly, softly shine; There are crystal dews in morning's paths Like the pearl-hoards of the brine! Those stars of midnight's stillness, They are mighty worlds and vast; And these dews of morning's fresh, fair hour May not bide the awakening blast! Aye! those stars are worlds majestic!— But those dews—faint fleeting things!— Breeze-touched or sun-kissed, how they pass— With sudden vanishings.— Yet, behold! they sparkle brightly— And but little difference seems, Between those worlds and dew-drops frail, Each far scattering trembling gleams!— Still our senses much deceive us!— And Creation's mightiest scenes Could never be to us made clear, Save through more exalted means!— And, oh! frail—weak—vain—imperfect, Are our knowledge too—and power: Perchance we make more wild mistakes In our life's brief troubled hour. And though we render homage To those worlds that blaze afar! And call the dew-drop slight and frail, And hail the immortal star— We may yet not mark the difference Between things more severed still— But deem one self-same source they have, And one self-same part fulfil! Many mysteries of deception Are around us evermore: There are things more glorious than those worlds By us passed lightly o'er! There are things more vain and fleeting Than light dews, of briefest date, Which to us seem—oh! more precious still, Than those glorious things and great! E'en revealed at once and hidden— Many wonders sure must be; We view them—yet we view them not As we aright should see!— While between us depths of distance, Of which we may little reck, Now may darkly spread, outstretched, immense. And all free communion check— While we deem that close beside us, Close at hand those wonders are!— Nor rack our thought to judge of them As unutterably far! Still we see them vaguely—faintly— Yet we deem we see aright, And with rash presumptuous fancy—fix Their limits by our sight. And we own not, with faith's meekness— These are throned above—too far. Oh! the Soul oft sees Earth's dew-drops brief, Bright as Heaven's undying Star! FROM “INEZ,” A MS. POEM. Of ye I ask—all ye who love— How is it ye are strong to move, Along Life's troubled, thorny way, With Soul seared deep—fierce passion's prey?— While my quick heart doth beat and burn— Fain, fain would I from others learn How I may bear up 'gainst the strength Of my devoted love, at length. Since I am new to this great grief, (From which there seemeth no relief!) And gladly would I learn and know The wisest way to bear this woe! Since unto me, I own, it seems One web of dark and burning dreams— Dark—but yet fiery—like some cloud, The Sunset's veil—the Lightning's shroud. Love!—Love!—I ne'er can think of thee, As coloured by felicity:— To thee I teach mine own dark Soul, Where seas of eddying tumult roll!— Oh! tell me, tell me how to bear The costly, but the deadly care— All ye who love, and groan beneath A sway as strong as that of Death! I know—I feel there is no cure— But tell me how I may endure!— How drag ye through the livelong day, Wishing its weight of hours away? How stand ye 'gainst the incessant shocks (As of deep waves against the rocks) Of fretting thoughts for evermore, Thrilling the heart's faint quiv'ring core? How do ye mantle and suppress— In midst of all Love's strange distress— The Sorrow that consumes and kills The pang which nothing soothes or stills? How, how, while thrill your heart's deep chords, Check ye the gush of burning words— Like sparks struck from the electric chain— The Passion-fountains' fiery rain? How do you suffer Absence' pangs— How brook ye Jealousy's sharp fangs— How cope with all the throes intense Of sharp Suspicions—stern Suspense? I struggle vainly 'gainst them all, And surely must a victim fall To all these lingering griefs at length, Thus lavishing Life's lessening strength. Teach me some secret way to bind, The o'erpowering tempests of the mind; Some way to conquer—to controul, The impetuous workings of the soul.— For surely ye some way must know, Who ever seem well skilled to throw A veil o'er feelings, thoughts, and dreams— Checked in their flow, like ice-bound streams. Teach me too how to check, to crush, The thoughts, the dreams, that deepening rush In one o'ermastering flood along, Too deep, too mighty, and too strong. Tell me, and teach me too, I pray, For pity's gentle sake, the way— And let me learn from those who love, How—crushed beneath that yoke, to move.— Away! weak thought!—it is in vain— Heart shut on patience in thy pain— Their teaching would but useless be— First they must learn to love like me! SONNET. [We faulter on with heavy hearts that bleed] We faulter on with heavy hearts that bleed, And souls that ache with quenchless longings vain, To be set free from many an earth-twined chain, Yet trust the mirage—cling unto the reed, And nobly shall these serve us at our need!— What matters it so we can trust again, And be again deceived?—still grief and pain It must be to feel all that seemed indeed— Substantial, present, real, actual, true, Is past and perished—to be no more found!— Gone, vanished like a quivering drop of dew, A cloud—a breath of air—a little sound— No matter—so we find delusions new, To which our Hearts and Souls may yet be bound! SORROW'S RICHES. Sorrow! pale, mighty Sorrow! thou dost come Like night, enrobed with a majestic gloom; My soul is full of thee, hour after hour— That soul thou overshadowest with thy power; But oft from thee with trembling fear it shrinks, And from the clasping of thy chain's strong links; Full oft it shrinks from thee;—yet, yet at times, Unto the cloud-capped heights of grief it climbs, And learns e'en to luxuriate in the excess Of feelings overwrought with rich distress, On which it lavishes its fiery strength, As though it fell in love with pain, at length; The griefs of old it suffers o'er again, And prides itself on their possession then— The rich regalia of my Sorrows lies, (For costly things are treasured agonies,) Displayed in royalty of triumph there, A funeral dark regalia!—sternly fair! 'Tis mine and Sorrow's coronation hour— I own and share her deep and sovereign power; I gather then—beholding how they shine, My melancholy riches, most divine! Shadowy but starry—(like the depths of night— Whose darkly-glorious purple burns with light! Streaming with far-off suns, that rise to us When sets our own proud orb, and luminous; For even the voice of Darkness echoeth low, “Let there be light!” and forth its fountains flow, While million splendours take the place of one, And light plays lightening on from sun to sun!— 'Tis in such mighty, and such solemn hour, While, Sorrow! I adore and bless thy power, That I do gather up my scattered woes, And crown imperially my lightened brows, With their faint clouds and constellations pale, Their shadows and their stars—crown, wreath, and veil— And grow a Queen of Griefs;—and proudly wear Their mournful splendours all—profoundly fair! I grow a queen of griefs, and wear them all, And clothe myself with shadows for a pall; While the most precious jewels that I boast Are those of mightiest and heart-wringing cost: Yea, the most precious jewels I then wear, The most imperial gems that shine forth there, Are the worst, wildest griefs that I have known, And mine own tears, like pearls, seem round me strown, (My own wild-flowing—anguish-raining tears, Those I then weep, or wept in bye-past years!) And rich Affliction's sumptuous bravery Hangs round me,—until nought beside I see. Thus robed in funeral magnificence, I reap from sorrow this dark joy intense, And crown with crowns imperial that pale brow, Which seems uplifted for its triumph now; And proud I grow of all that I have borne, And slight and petty griefs can spurn and scorn: It is a pomp and luxury of distress, Far richer than the richest happiness!— And thus a Queen of many Griefs I grow, And boast of all that I have borne of woe! Mine the veiled empires of the Eternal pain, Wide as the world and deeper than the main!— (Those veiled and shadowy empires of the night, That spread beyond e'en Thought's far-journeying flight, And boast—broad realms there spread, as yet unknown— A Space and an Eternity—their own!) My soul thus grows, oh! how augustly sad, In gorgeous pomp of crowned afflictions clad— And bows to that Dejection's conquering might, Whose dark, illustrious truth outstrips delight. Sorrow! I will not, may not shrink from thee, For thou art power, and truth, and majesty— One hour with thee doth teach our souls far more Than all Life's happier hours—pass'd lightly o'er. I SAW THE SHIVERED GOBLET. I saw the shivered goblet!— From its crystal rim no more Shall the blood-red wine at banquets Stream, high-sparkling as before! I saw the fallen, dimmed mirror— And I marked then as I passed, How darkened and distorted Were the images it glassed! On the lyre, all crushed and shattered, I looked with sorrowing eye; Alas! for perished sweetness— And forgotten melody. I saw the once-prized picture With its changed and clouded hues, Where the dimmed and faded features Did all light of likeness lose! And I saw the broken tablet— Oh! hand never more shall trace Words of passion's fire or feeling On its rent and ruined face— And I saw the wreath all scattered, Which no precious incense shed; For the broken flowers were blighted, Wan—withered—bloomless—dead. The vase, in glistening fragments, I looked on as it lay; Never more to hold rich treasures, As it did in bye-gone day! And I saw the chain of jewels, With each rich link loosened—marred; And a crushed and troubled splendour Seemed that rainbowed band and starred! I beheld the bow of battle, Spoiled and broken—cast aside, Never more with spear and banner Might it take its place of pride! And I saw the lamp lie shattered, Where quick flame once quivering played, When, from massive chain suspended, Bright the festal hall it made!— And for these fair things I sorrowed, It was sad their change to mark; Where was light, strength, music, beauty, All was still—or frail—or dark! But a fresh thing claimed my sorrow, (World!—how full of gloom thou art!) Of all wrecks the chief, the mightiest!— 'Twas a crushed and broken heart! Crystal goblet—flawed and shivered, Fractured mirror—shattered lyre— Ye are senseless—void of suffering— Woe for stricken hearts of fire! Faded picture—broken tablet, Wreath and vase no longer fair; All your various, separate ruins Seem to meet and mingle there! From the crushed heart, freely never, Shall the fiery fountain stream; Not the wine that crowns the goblet Erst might match its purple beam! Never more, with proud reflection Nature's glories shall it glass, O'er its trampled mirror darkly Shall each troubled image pass— And that living lyre of music, Once by ruthless stroke destroyed— Oh! no more its trembling pulses Shall to sweet strains be up-buoyed!— That deep heart seemed one bright picture Of creation's glorious things; But with colours, dulled and faded, No fair truthful trace it brings!— On the bruised heart's broken tablet Never characters of light Shall be stamped in power and triumph— And in Inspiration's might! Like a withered Wreath of Summer, Seems it scorched up to the core— Ne'er to shed round life and freshness— Nor rich incense-breathings more Like a sumptuous vase in fragments— Never more shall it contain A bright hoard of gathered treasures, But forsaken shall remain.— Like the loosened chain of jewels, Marred in every precious part, Crushed from all its costly beauty, Lies the darkly-ruined heart! Like the mighty bow of battle— Broken—broken—cast aside— Helpless 'mid the strife and conflict— Seemest thou, heart!—whose hope hath died. Like the lamp—the fair lamp shivered, That no more shall shed around Festal light's rich sparkling splendours, Thou'rt of flame and light uncrowned! Broken goblet, lyre, and mirror, Tablet—picture, crushed and changed, Wreath, and vase, and chain of jewels, From your former pride estranged! Bow of battle!—sounding arrow That no more shall launch in power; Lamp, fair lamp—whence light shall never Stream again through festal hour! O'er your heavy state I sorrowed, E'er a sadder thing I found— A fiery heart of fervent feeling, Bleeding life out from its wound! That embraced a thousand sufferings, In one deep and full despair— All your several separate ruins Seemed to meet and mingle there! THE LAMP—THE LYRE—THE HEART! The Lamp is flickering faint and low, With a waning, wavering flame; With a dubious light—a fluttering glow, As with some unsteadfast aim. The Lyre is pouring harsh strange sounds, 'Tis an unmelodious strain; Transgressing harmony's sweet bounds: Oh! touch it not again! That flickering Lamp is fed no more, Untuned that harsh-voiced Lyre— And can no care, no art restore The music—and the fire? Yes! yes! the sweetness of the tone, The brightness of the flame, That now appear for ever flown— Shall yet be made the same! The same e'en as they were before— All melody—all light— Yes! art and care shall swift restore These things, with magic might!— But what of thee, thou broken Heart! Whose flame is flickering low? Alas! no care, no skill, no art Shall e'er repair that glow! Thy precious music-throbbings hushed!— Dull silence locks thy chords— The broken heart—chilled, blighted, crushed— Weeps blood for want of words. The Lamp, the Lyre—shall boast once more Their fiery—silvery sway— But, Heart, no skill shall thee restore, That mourn'st thine own decay! Trim, trim the Lamp, and tune the Lyre, But torture not the Heart— 'Twere vain!—in peace let that expire, 'Tis best it should depart! Should it survive its joys, its hope, Its music, and its light, In dull dead languor's gloom to droop Beneath the mortal blight,— How harsh, how heavy were its fate, In that cold stony rest; Feeling it now is desolate, And that it hath been blest! Heart, whose winged fiery dreams are past, Whose melodies are crushed, Take refuge from the storm, the blast, Where every pang is hushed! LINES FROM “INEZ,” A MS. POEM. Thou lov'st me, then! enough! it is enough; For now, now smoothed seem life's fierce billows, rough: Softened its harshest trials—lit and cleared Its gloomiest depths—its very pains endeared By that most royal knowledge!—clear and deep— For all my soul as wealth divine to keep. Oh! what a trust—a treasure—Love and thee, To bless my soul's impassioned fervency!— Oh! beatific consciousness!—Oh! thought! With rich varieties of rapture fraught; Oh! most illustrious knowledge—brightly shrined Within the deep recesses of my mind!— Crowned—proud—illustrious knowledge! height of bliss!— My dreaming heart ne'er dreamt of joy like this! I shrink, I tremble, troubled by the excess Of my intense soul-dazzling happiness— The sun is in my soul!—I cannot bear The ethereal glory, and the unearthly glare; I sink—I faint—before that joy's deep strength: Oh! happiness, my life is thee at length!— Thou lov'st me, then? enough!—it is enough!— My heart exults—as when from some deep trough O'the yawning sea a labouring straining bark, Up-climbs and gleams from out the shadows dark; With its white sails; my heart now climbs the wave Of joy and hope—raised, raised from Sorrow's grave, Where long it slept in silence, fear, and gloom; Oh! the wrung heart is its own hollow tomb! But hence with every thought and dream of woe, Why should its dull streams, with their gloomy flow, Now mix with thy sweet fountain-waters, clear, Oh! Happiness—that dwellest in beauty here! When in the grasp of Sorrow we remain, And bend beneath the load of grief and pain; Not there one trace of fair Delight is found— Not there, oh! Joy, dost thou come hovering round— Thy brightness with her darkness deep to blend, Thy smile serene to her stern mien to lend. Then say, shall Sorrow come to interfere With thy bright triumph now, and doubt and fear, Upon her shadowing, darkly-sweeping wing To dash thy stately cheer, presume to bring— And 'twixt thy crowding raptures interpose The dull, deep clouds and threatenings of her woes? No; henee with every thought and dream of grief!— When Summer comes, let not one shrivelled leaf Remain to tell the story of the Past— Nor breathe one whisper of the Winter's waste— Grief! Joy ne'er comes to trouble thy stern reign, Thou hold'st thine undisputed rule of pain!— Thou shalt not cast one shadow o'er his light, Nor weaken for one moment's space his might!— SONNET. [With our own selves we people the Universe!—] With our own selves we people the Universe!— And where Mysterious Presences brood round As though all Nature teem'd with life profound (In the old time when Men's minds loved to nurse Strange Superstitions—Ignorance' foul curse— And now, since now, that Men do strive to sound The depths of Truth and Knowledge, nor one bound, Will bear to find, not all do they disperse!— But crowd and crown our solitude) ne'er doubt Those Presences are Shadows of the Soul!— Our vast existence spreads within—without— Till uncreated Worlds around us roll! So with Ourselves teems the Universe.—About Our conscious thoughts we shed—till their hues stamp the whole! SONNET. [Thought!—but thou hast an Eagle-shaming wing!] Thought!—but thou hast an Eagle-shaming wing! Thought! be my Life!—I will but live in thee; And whatsoe'er I list I then can be; For thou alone art crowned, throned, scepter'd King Of all we know or see—the invisible thing That now drinks at the Sun's red heart, and free, Lightens up all the Heavens!—now seems to flee From light and life, and Joy and Hope's proud spring, To rend a cloudy way through Eldest night, To rake the old Darkness for all treasures deep— That never yet have been brought forth to light; (For though he gives up thousand Worlds—to keep Dread secrets—mysteries still!—is his proud right!)— Thought! be my Life!—my Soul in triumph steep. SONNET. [Away from me, vain Thoughts!—once more—away!] Away from me, vain Thoughts!—once more—away! I will not bend nor bow—I will be true To Reason's noblest dictates, and thy due, Oh! Heavenly Duty!—rigorously will pay, Though heart's blood be i' the bond!—dark weary day That sees me toil with suffering patience through My deep allotted share of grief—renew Thy better Courage, Heart!—Ne'er lightly play With thine own vital feelings, yielding thus To still encroaching Passion's mastering sway, The imperiously severe and tyrannous! E'en now what strengthenedst thou thy voice to say, Till thy proud cry grew deep as when to us, Night's rising winds sound loud—shall aught thy faith dismay? A THOUGHT. My Soul, dread Sire!—thee sought in Worlds afar! From Sun to Sun it coursed—from Star to Star; Then, whelmed in its august Desire's despair, Sank back into itself—and found thee there! SONNET. [Retired far, far from this world's busy throng] Retired far, far from this world's busy throng, (Among which feeling hearts but yearn and pine For something which with loftier dreams to twine,) Amid the place of graves I loitered long, It mattered not that birds were at their song; That Spring—bright Spring, was at her work divine Of fair contrivance; nothing could unshrine That holy Melancholy, deep and strong, From my tranced heart,—which all-o'ershadowing grew From that first, last, and most undying Thought, The Thought of Death—which wheresoe'er it woo The soul to its embrace—with fear seems fraught! Most—most—where all things wear Life's triumph-hue! And least—where thus, mid haunts, of its own gloom, 'tis sought!— SONG. [Or better love!—or love me not] Or better love!—or love me not; Give all or none of thy young heart. I struggle with a troubled lot— Nor claim in joy or grief my part! Let me at least my sentence know, This little love is worse than hate: I cannot sink—resigned to woe— Nor stand—with steadfast joy elate! Or better love—or not at all— I'd rather grovel in the dust— Than in a weak and tottering wall Place all my fond and trembling trust. I'd rather rest me in the dark, Than by the marsh-lamp's treacherous light (A feeble and misleading spark,) Be lured to strive with storm and night! THE FESTIVAL. There were thousand garlands twining In the festal hall that night, And a thousand bright lamps shining, Made a sweeping sea of light! And fawn-like steps were bounding, With light grace and mirthful cheer— And joyous music sounding, Thrill'd in sweetness on the ear! From face to face there turning— All with smiles of pleasure drest— You beheld no trace of mourning; Grief were there no welcome guest! And methought!—“Oh! mirth and gladness, Ye have made these hearts your own; Surely ne'er by them hath sadness In its spring-tide flow been known!” Surely none now here assembled Have in bitter anguish wept!— O'er the living Dying, trembled— O'er the lifeless Slumberer wept! Surely none, 'midst those here gathered In this bright and joyous throng, Have affliction's bleak storm weathered, The terrible and strong! None that now I see before me Have e'er felt the chilling weight Of such clouds as have poured o'er me, And obscured my hopeless fate!” Then a deeper thought struck keenly, My vain-pondering, dreaming heart; And I felt—I too serenely Am now bearing here my part! My step too is free and springing, And my face in smiles arrayed; And have I ne'er felt Grief's stinging— Bowed beneath her funeral shade? Oh! but I have known all Sorrows— That walk earth like shadowy powers; And yet my bruised heart e'en borrows A bright cheer from festal hours! Then, amidst the many round me— Ah! perchance there is not one, From the chain of grief which bound me, That on earth hath walked free—none! Well, well it is we smother Such secrets, dark and vain— And hide still from each other The mysteries of our pain! If 'twere not for such concealing, 'Twere a world of sevenfold woe; And one universal feeling Of despair should spread below! But our grief—we seek to entomb it— With a nice and jealous pride; And full often half o'ercome it, While we strive e'en thus to hide! While we struggle hard to veil it— To no eye, no strange eye shown, (Ceasing, ceasing to bewail it,) We oft shroud it from our own! We bury in earth's bosom Our departed ones—our Dead— In our own we tomb each blossom Of fallen Hope, whose life hath fled! And 'tis well, 'tis well we smother Our pain—with jealous pride, From ourselves—as from each other Oft we thus its fulness hide! There were thousand garlands blushing In the festal hall that night— And from thousand lamps was gushing A flood of golden light. And that golden light reflected From a thousand faces seemed; Not one wore a look dejected— Each with bright expressions beamed. Would you read the hearts of others, Pierce the mystery—raise the mask— Think on all your own still smothers!— Have you aught beside to ask? GIFTS. Give good things still to those that need; The houseless clothe—the hungry feed; And minister to every want— Blest is the aid the generous grant. Give to the glad and bounding child, With fresh, elastic spirits wild, Kind words, kind looks, kind smiles to greet, And on its merry way to meet! Give to the young—the hope-cheered young, Round whom life's rosiest lights are flung Flowers—flowers—those fairy-gifts of spring— And every bright and lovely thing! Give costly offerings to the great— Meet for their high and proud estate— And worthless, worthless but to them The gem but suits the diadem! Give unto him that toils in ways Of just ambition—meed of praise— The laurel crown—the inspiring cheer, And speed him on his bright career! But give, oh! give to all who mourn, To sorrow and to suffering born, Pure sympathy's deep tears and sighs, Which Grief knows fondly well to prize. Give tears—kind tears to all who mourn! Alas! and who of woman born May claim not those dark mournful gifts? (Though joy inspires, though hope uplifts.) The poor and friendless faintly groan, An hungered, through long hours and lone: The heart hath its strong hunger too, To nature and to feeling true! The bread that cheers the fluttering breath Saves not the soul from daily death: If all unaswered upon earth— It starves and wastes, in feeling's dearth!— Thy brother in his need doth know A nobler and more touching woe— He from his kind seems thrust apart, The outcast, and orphan of the heart! Unless with love—the kind—the true, Thou sorrowest o'er his sufferings too, Thy gift a barren gift shall be— Thy charity—no charity! With earth-grown bread—give love's rich dole; That Heaven-sent manna of the soul; The hunger of the heart to cheer, Give words of kindness, and its tear; And for the bounding child, so fair, With streamers bright of sunny hair, Laughing along its lightsome way, As human life were but all play! Deem'st thou that sighs were there misplac'd? Ye judge in rash and thoughtless haste: It hath all griefs to undergo, To learn life's lesson, woe by woe! Thy brethren—those of riper years Are now grown conversant with tears; The first fierce wrench from peace is o'er; The sharp, stern shock shall come no more! Thy little brethren claim from thee Thy tenderest pity's sympathy: They have to learn they dwell beneath, With pain and sorrow, sin and death! That dark and deadly knowledge they Have yet to learn with sick dismay! Their souls have yet, from cloudless light, To plunge in darkness, gloom, and night! All those first, fiercest wounds and woes, Which break up the young heart's repose, The first—the first—the worst to bear, Must be the child's dark, certain share! When once the fearful plunge is made We grow familiar with the shade: Grief hath no more such mastering power!— Its opening is its mightiest hour! Weep then for those with lids unwet, Who sigh not for themselves as yet! Weep for them, in their tender years,— Thy little brethren claim thy tears! The thorn must pierce, the snake must sting; The mortal, mortal anguish wring,— These things must come with coming years:— Give, give thy little brethren tears! The bright, glad maiden, fair and meek, With downcast eye and blushing cheek,— The youthful lover, blythe and gay— Yes! strew fresh flowers along their way. But yet,—yet there too—there is cause For deeper look, and thoughtful pause— They love, and pour on fleeting dust, The mighty fulness of their trust. And e'en in their mid-happiness They feel strange tremblings of distress— The uncertainty of all on earth Troubles their triumph—mars their mirth. Their joys, indeed, like stars outshine, Far glittering, with a light Divine; But then those heavenly jewels bright Gleam set and framed in death-dark night! Their lives are crown'd with precious love!— They yet 'mid many shadows move, Of doubt and change, and fear and fate, Aye, e'en in this, their blissful state! And theirs can scarce be called repose;— Oh, no! they have too much to lose! The trouble of their tenderness Still deepens on unto excess! The anxieties of passion's sway— Their fond, faint fears lest some dark day Should loose those tenderest ties and best— These shake their peace—these break their rest. To love, must ever be to fear, While destiny and death reign here: The heart its wealth in fear enfolds— Its precious treasures trembling holds. Give tears and sighs unto the young, Whose costly happiness is flung Upon the changeful winds of life, Exposed to all their chill and strife! Strew flowers, fresh flowers, bright, blushing flowers Along their path in rainbow'd showers! For youth and love themselves are fair As some rich flower of beauty rare. Breathe sighs—shed tears—deep feeling tears For them, e'en in their smiling years! For they shall weep too—they shall sigh, When loves depart and pleasures die! E'en now they sigh—e'en now they weep, For joys there are too rich—too deep! Affection's, Feeling's joys supreme, They make all else appear a dream. Life—life too bounded and too brief, Becometh in itself a Grief— While still they pine for worlds more fair, And pant for purer, ampler air. Strange—strange it is that joy and love Themselves full often darkly prove;— The source of sorrow and unrest— On earth we're perilously blest; For every bliss that we may share We pay a heavy price of care; And those who never gladness knew Ne'er look'd on sorrow's darkest hue! Those for whose lips no joy-streams flow, Ne'er drain'd the bitterest draughts of woe; But those who know and prize them most, How fare they when those founts are lost? And e'en the very fear is death!— They who feel most breathe trembling breath, Their heart-strength seems with doubt to melt, And what is joy, when coldly felt? Pity the happy, who possess In anxious dread their happiness— Whose thoughts one long, keen vigil keep— Whose hearts—fond watchers—never sleep! And who, amidst the happy, who Are those who ne'er such feelings knew? If precious things are peace and rest, Give tears unto the young and blest! If stillness, solemn and serene— Indifference to this earthly scene Be good, these things but grow with years— Give to the young and happy—tears! For those of high and haughty birth, The proud and mighty of the earth,— Deem we but costly offerings meet, To lay considerate at their feet? They, too, howe'er it may appear— Howe'er pride's towering brow they rear, Are bankrupts—beggars, if they own No feeling—and no love have known! They, too, impoverished are indeed, And sufferers, with one mighty need!— If they are lone and hopeless here— Pity them on their high career! Not all earth's treasures poured forth free, With all the treasures of the sea, Can make him rich, whose heart is poor— Who hails no loved friend at his door!— And e'en if love and friendship come To dwell with them in their proud home; Still many ills unrecked of wait On the envied doom of high estate. While reverence they, and homage claim, They're open, too, to scorn and blame,— And, oh! how deadly these must be To feasters upon flattery! And then, midst those that seem to love— That seem to honour and approve,— How few there are that they can feel Are sealed with faithfulness' own seal! How must they long, yet dread to try Their bosom-friend's fidelity,— Walking in shadowy doubt for years— Give to the Proud and Prosperous—tears! Th' inspiring cheer—the laurel crown To him who doth profoundly own A pure ambition, high and just, Uplifted to a lofty trust. To him who would shine forth among The hero, or the patriot throng, And link to honoured names his name, And earn a bright and stainless fame; Whose fervent soul is all on fire, Ennobled by its fine desire,— Aye, much ennobled—crowned—not less Than 'twould be by the great success! And yet, while thus he struggleth on, May not Ambition's noble son Our pity claim, as well as praise?— He walketh in uncertain ways! Temptations—troubles—wrongs beset, A thousand dark mischances threat, Until at last he reach the goal,— How oft he mourns with stricken soul! Nor there, e'en there, perchance may he Reap triumph in tranquillity:— His part, indeed, is proudly done, And palm and Victory's crown are won! But there are dark, ungrateful hearts, That ill perform and fill their parts,— That render back reproach and blame For all his deeds—so dear to Fame. And after he hath made the crown Of Fame and Victory all his own, 'Tis as the bitterness of death To see one breath-stain on that wreath! Then he, e'en in his dazzling sphere— In his proud march and mid career, May not alone demand thy praise, But thus thy generous pity raise! Aye, e'en though foul ingratitude Should not on his free joy intrude, He may confess, in earth's vain years, His triumphs little more than tears! Weep, weep, true heart, for all that mourn,— Then weep for all that e'er were born! For none may breathe the berath of life, And shun its sorrows and its strife! THOUGHTS—LOVELIEST THOUGHTS! Thoughts—loveliest thoughts, that, when I dwell alone, Visit my soul, yet scarcely seem its own: (Like heavenly angels that have lost their way, And gone—while tracking star by star—astray!) Ye come!—ye go! like lightning in the skies— That leaps to life, and in that moment dies! Ye come!—ye go! but oh! each precious thought A wealth of hope and fear, and bliss hath brought— And these survive it—these remain behind, Each leaves its track of glory on the mind! I seek to hold thee still, and to detain Thou, lovely thought, that kindleth in my brain! But thou art gone—half shadow and half light, Thou seem'dst to flutter on my inner sight, A beauteous vision, indistinct, yet fair,— I find a thousand still, but thou'rt not there! But if thou wert not mine—not all made mine I grew in that profound communion—thine: Part of my soul away thou seem'dst to bear, And lift it through the stainless realms of air!— My soul thus its own messenger becomes, Unto the stillness of those starry homes: My spirit, its own courier thus is made, To those bright realms whose sunshine may not fade! Ye lovely thoughts! pure, fervid, deep, and grand, Like angels on my soul ye take your stand One precious moment; then resign your place, And leave behind a rich and glowing trace, While others crowd in,—where ye were before, And wear those hues celestial that ye wore! Ye part—ye pass—ye scarcely seem mine own; And yet this soul—this very soul hath flown With these on wings, rejoicing far away, Into the regions of transcendant day! So we anticipate the all-glorious flight, From earth's dull darkness to the worlds of light! THE TWO SHIPS. Lo! two ships on one shining sea,— One bears it on right gallantly: A breezy current this impels, The streamer waves—the white sail swells: Another near it doth remain, As though 'twere bound by secret chain: No current aids it on its course— It hath no motion, and no force:— And is it not even so on earth? One heart is buoyed by joy and mirth, The while another, darkly near, Is bound by sorrow, or by fear, Like two ships on one shining sea,— One saileth on right merrily; Another sleepeth on the main, As though 'twere thralled by secret chain! FALLING STARS. Oh! never call it love that wanes—that flies;— Ne'er call it love that changes and that dies! Essentially eternal,—'tis still known By changeless truth—by fixed continuance shown. The stars of Heaven in deathless triumph reign,— No sun may pass—no constellation wane. We know, when lights that looked like suns—once fall, That they were not, could not be stars at all. A LAST FAREWELL. Farewell! Yet 'tis not now, not now we part! Oh! false that thou hast been, and that thou art— When changed thy soul—and when thy love was o'er, 'Twas then we parted—and for evermore. Aye! false and too forgetful that thou art, Worlds cannot sever—oceans cannot part: Like falsehood—treachery—coldness;—then, farewell, Near thee, thus severed,—it were death to dwell! FLOWERS IN LONDON. Be blessings, flowers! upon your precious breath, More precious from your own sweet haunts afar: The fair, pure treasures of the flow'ry wreath, In the close, crowded city. priceless are. Ye bring blue heavens with ye—bring vernal airs; Our souls in your delicious presence melt: With ye still near, we own, midst all our cares— Thus—the unseen World of Nature—not unfelt! SONNET TO ?. [She reigns!—the Beautiful—the Young, the Bright] She reigns!—the Beautiful—the Young, the Bright, And the old proud Ocean lifts up, in amaze, His many-centuried head on her to gaze!— The youthful form, all loveliness and light, Who wields his Stormy Sceptre, now aright!— To her be love and homage, and all praise; For surely that throned Virgin pure shall raise The Land to yet more proud and palmy height: It seems as though that Land were governed now Even by a bright commission from above, (Which Heaven in favour doth to us allow!) Sure Mercy, Innocence, Hope, Truth, and Love Are sent to rule us!—so replete art thou, Oh, Queen! with virtues—charms—graces, that all approve! SONNET TO ?. [Star of the Islands!—whose auspicious ray] Star of the Islands!—whose auspicious ray Seems full of Heavenly promise, bright and clear; Fair doth our far horizon now appear, All brightening in the light of thy calm sway!— Till clouds and mists and darkness melt away, And the sweet Heaven seems smiling yet more near: Ne'er dawned on England a more blessed day! It shines—it blazes on the enraptured sight— Its very morn wears a meridian glow!— Star of the Isles!—the Beautiful—the Bright! Mankind thy Friend—for who could be thy Foe?— Glory thine Handmaid—move on dowered with might; May England's Joy from thee—and back to thee still flow!</field>
