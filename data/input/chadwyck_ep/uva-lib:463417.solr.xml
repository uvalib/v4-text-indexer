      <field name="fulltext">Romes Monarchie. Il premio é meritato TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, MOST WORTHIE for vertues, Master Alderman Slany, Lord Maior of the citie of London: the right Worshipfull Master Thomas Low, and Master Leonard Halliday, Aldermen and Sheriffes of the same citie: and to the right Worshipfull the rest of the Aldermen their brethren, and other the Magistrates in authoritie there: long life, bealth, and all good happes in this life, and after eternall felicitie. CAP. 1. The building of Carthage, and Rome, the expelling of Romes Kings, and first choosing of Cousuls there, the ouerthrow of 300. Romaines being all of one name, and familie, called Fabians. Of Priams pompe, his pallace or his towne, Srong Troy, the wals, or how those warres began Which ten yeres held, by Grecians last beat down: Or whether side the praise or glorie wanne Is not here ment at all, vpon to scanne: Yet will my muse (in meane style) pen I imploy Or warres to write long after that from Troy, Æineas came into Italia soyle: But, leauing him and farther on to passe: Excepting too, what euer iarre or broyle, Did after chance till Rome yfounded was By Romulus, whose birth is counted base: Thus much is sayd, because Æneas line, Is brought by writ, in Cæsars seate to shine:Who commanded the whole world. Virg Aene. lib.5. For, when Augustus, surnam'de Cæsar, sate Sole with the Scepter in th'imperiall throne, Virgil, to praise his high discent, and state, In his Æneidos, makes it to him knowne, How Troian race the world then rul'de alone, Old Priams stocke (of Troy that famous king) In him Oct. August. most fresh, ore all the earth did spring. But memorie, and fame of nations olde, Swift time makes ende, as was as of beginning. Romes base commence in writing is enrolde, To be at first, a webbe of slender spinning; And yet at last had all the world winning, As floudes at first come slylie creeping in, So at full sea, to ebbe do straight begin. The spread eagle, the armes of the Emperour. So worketh time of euery thing the change: O Rome whose wings sometime the earth orespread, Thy glories gone, thy fame still lasting, strange, Thy captaines that did raise thy state are dead, Both Pompee, and Cæsars aspiring head, With many moe, their monarchies and all: Whom Time hath rais'de, and likewise made to fall. Whatsoeuer is decreed by diuine power, worldly policie cannot withstand. But, what so fates and destinie allottes, Fortune will not gainsay, or backe withholde What subiect is vnto her staines and spottes, Nought can auaile, no mines, or mounts of golde. And what againe in fauour she doth holde, Shall mount, and weare both diademe, and crowne, And vnlook'te for, as fast come tumbling downe. Proofe of thse things by Carthage first of twaine, Whose plotted seate queene Dido the new maried wife of Sicheus, wh? the king of Tyrus slue, from whose cruel tyranie Dido fled into Afrique. 50 yeares before Troyes destruction. Dido did beginne, By graunt obtain'de, and so much ground did gaine To build vpon, in reach of a bulles skinne, Which she cut small in pieces long and thinne: In lengthes stretcht out, it farre orespead the field In circuite, there the walles she gan to build With houses braue, high towers, temples fayre, The stately Forte, which Birsa had to name: Whose toppes high mounted, seem'de to touch the ayre: For strength and wealth the world it had for fame. Yet for all that, the Romaines it orecame, The citie sackt, and raz'de the walles to ground: Whose match ech way, on earth was th? scarse found. Of Rome, the walles and buildings first of all, Olde writtes record, that Romulus began To Betweene 350 or 400 yeares after Troyes destruction, or Eeneas comming into Italie. found the same, whose meane estate, some call Him shepheard borne, or else a bare heardsman Nurst by a wolfe; but he such glory wan, As fates decree the chance of euery thing, His power grew so, as lastly made him king. And after him, if histories say true, Two hundreth yeares, adde fortie foure withall, I.Kinges. Sixe kings more raign'de, ech one in order due, The last of which, his pride did cause to fall: And name of king did euer after thrall, To rule, or rainge, that famous citie in, Who called was that time, the proud Tarquin. 2.Consuls. Their Kings expel'd, two Consuls next bare sway, Whose office was t'endure for a yeare, Iunius Brutus to the state a stay, Chiefe cause the Tarquins Romes kings chased were; His owne two sonnes, no whit he did forbeare For to be head, with others, seeking meane, Their Tarquins kings for to restore againe. Iustice. Iustice duly and rightly executed, causeth a commonwealth to flourish A noble deed of iustice, right, and zeale: O happie place where rulers vpright stand. A worthy member of a publique weale: A president for euery state and land, Vice to correct with rod of iustice hand. Thus Consuls two, in place of kings did guide The state of Rome, which after stretched wide. During which time, discordes did often rise At home, and forth, A prouince in Italie neere vnto Rome an il neighbour to their state. Toscane the countrie hight That then made warre, but Rome did them despise, Three hundreth Romaines went with them to fight: All of one name cal'd Fabians, put to flight Their armie, and they all slaine, left no more Of that name but a child, who did restore Their house againe: which chaunce to Rome did fall Thirtie three yeares, after their kings decay, And after that three hundreth yeares in all Of Romes building, things at vncertaine stay, By reason brawles did often them affray: From them Ambassage to the Grecians went, Who lawes to Rome in brassie tables sent. CAP. 2. The third and fourth alteration of officers in Rome, where, after many changes the Consuls were of continuance vntill Iulius Cæsar. In meane estate was Rome at that same time, Wanting both wittes, and men of wisedomes lore To make them lawes: but things that be in prime Come to be ripe, though it be long before: In Greece that time were wisemen plenteous store, That in all kind of Artes profound did florish, Romes weake estate with wisedome they did norish. Those lawes brought home the publike state, &amp; weale, Rechanged was from Consuls two as then To Decemuirs supremely that did deale With euery cause, as much to say Tenne men: But this new change, was altered soone agen: Appius Claude, one of that number tho Committing rape, that gouernment did orethrow. A magistrate, to doe an act so vile: The people would no longer them permit, Consuls againe were chose, who but a while Did last, but yet againe began to flit Their officers, for so it was thought fit: Two Tribunes then were chose, whose power and might Was Consul like, the peoples wrong to right. L. Quintius Cincinnatus. This time also which was three hundreth yeare, And fifteene since the citie first was founded, An office was which onely one did beare, Which seemes to be, on great authoritie grounded: Dictator, which office had endured now alreadie about 70 yeares. Dictator calde, who caus'de to death be wounded Spurius Melius, who sought to be Romes roye, His house and name, for euer to destroye. Two yeares next after gouernment againe, To warlike Tribunes, came seruing in warre Abroade, at home, as fortune list to raigne, To stint all striues of mutinie and iarre: And to keepe off, the enemie a farre: Which did endure about some seuentie, In all which time, men worthie many were. Amongst them all one Furius Camille, For vertue past all those, supplied that place, For seruice good, he was requited ill: He in exile, was forct to take his race, Although sometime he Consull were in grace. Ingratitude Ingratitude so raignes in peoples mindes, For doing good, with ill requitall findes. Causelesse exilde, the Senate him recalde, Whose vertue sau'de all Rome from spoyle and sacke By French men Burguinions. Malice not of any continuance, but vanquished by virtue. wrought, and therefore was restalde In dignitie, for putting them to wracke. Thus fortune plaies with men, now forth, then backe: Dictator he was after in two yeares, Vertue supprest, at length more great appeares. A worthy wight eke Manlius ycalde, Soone after that, the Capitall did guard, Against the French: who welnie hap it thralde, The vertuous often times are diffamed by enuie, &amp; foyled. In doing which, he had an hard reward: Suspicion foule, his fame and glory bard: (Sans proofe) suppos'd he would Romes state distaine: For which he was cast from rocke Tarpeiane. Decreed it was, not any of his race Or noble house, thenceforth should beare the name Of Marc, which seem'de as then a great disgrace: But to rehearse againe before mentioned Camillus fame, Who seuen times of Tribune had the name: To leade the Romaines vnto battell bolde, Had good successe, and died very olde. CAP. 3. Of Romes seueritie in iustice, of their constancie for the common wealthes cause, the time of Alexander the great his being, and of the Romaines warres against Pirrhus, King of Epirotes. About this time the care and charge of the comm?wealth came from the Tribunes to Consuls againe. Romes age was now three hundreth foure score, Also nine yeares, when Captains there was sound Most valiant, wise, the like was nere before: Who in assaults, their enemies brought to ground: Themselues not dreading death, or deadly wound. Too long it were their names all to recite, Who in defence of Romes estate did fight. And in the same vs'de iustice for small crime, Amongst all which one of them doe I finde Terquatus nam'de, chiefe Consull at that time: His onely sonne (a thing faire out of kinde) He caus'd to die, for fighting out of the place he was charged to stand in. (vnassin'de) Against his foe, which he orecame in fight, Though well he did, law could not him acquight. What lawes were made, were duely executed, Such men they were, Heroicall of minde: For dastards they disdain'd to be reputed, For countries weale, dutie and loue did binde Their deaths to seeke, rather then lines to finde: For to aduance the Romaines state and name, Willing died many, to gaine perpetuall fame. One Decius Mus, did vow to lose his life In fight against the Latines, Romaines foes, For countries cause, which he perform'd, in strife With them that time, which made the Latines lose The field that day, receiuing bloodie blowes. One of selfe name after 44. yeares after in a battell against the french Senonois. his sonne also In such like cause, his life did cke forgoe. Although that he were Consull at that time: About which time as written I doe finde, The Monarch great was then in chiefest prime: Alexander the great. Macedo king, stout Alexanders minde, Whose conquests great, were but a puffe of winde: For when he had maistred the world all, At Babylon by poyson had his fall. Against the state of Rome he did intend To haue made warre, if Asia once subdued, In this time liued Homoer and Socrates. Then next through all Europa to have wend, His hands yet more in blood to have imbrued: But fates by death his purpose did seclude, At 12. yeares raigne, and 33. yeares age, His part being playd he left vaine worlds stage. His force against, (but death you heare forbad) Papirius was for Romaines chieftaine chose, Whose valiantnesse great fame attayned had, In giuing foyle to Samnites cruell foes To Romaines, tho in danger like to lose Their army all, vnder their T. Veturius Caluin, and Spurius Post. humus albin. C?suls, who dishonourably had talen truce with the enemie, greatly to the Romaines disgrace.Consuls twaine, Papirius force did victorie obtaine. Dictator he that office after bare, And earnest was in martiall discipline, Expert, and quicke, in warlike feates his care Was euermore, that souldiers should encline, Not nice to be, to lodge, or dyet fine, But valiant, stout, and to endure all toyle, Which made them oft to giue their foes the foyle. In this time loe of Romes encreasing fame, In Saragosse the Dionisius the tyrant of Syracusa, Tyrant then did raigne, Whom to aduise with precepts good there came: Diuine Plato who hardly scapt vnslaine, This tyrants acts was had in such disdaine: In histories who list to reade shall see, His hatefull life vpheld by tyrannie. Strange were his acts, too many to be tolde Here in this place: but for to make the rest To be supposde, from one I cannot hold: Of Barbar would he nere be trim'd or drest, There are many wold trust the barbar to trim their beards if they had any. For feare the razor should his life arest: His daughters aye with nutshels burning bright, Should sindge his beard, and so his head to dight. But now returne to noble Rome againe. After the death of Alexander great Fortie two yeares, one Pirrhus that did raigne Epirotes King. the Romanes state did threate: His armie did their forces oft defeate, Yet, are two yeares were gone and ouerpast, He sought their peace and friendship at the last. To which request the Senate would haue graunted: But Appius Claude full seauen times elected Consull, then old and blind, their purpose daunted, Or cowardise the Senate he detected, In publique speech he Pirrhus peace reiected. Fabritius eke gainst Pirrhus stout did stand, Friendship with him to hold, would at no hand. Though Pirrhus did to him great presents send, With offers mo, for to reuolt and turne Vpon his side, Fabritius would not bend Constancie to the commonweale in a Magistrate. For presents, ne for promises, once spurne Against Romes state, such loue in him did burne To countries weale, (O patterne pretious stone For this our age to looke, nay gaze vpon.) Yet more, what did this noble heathen knight? (But Machiauels, from whom all mischiefs springs, The heath? scorned th? Machiauels devices, now a daies too much raigning. Worke contrary) he voyd of hate or spight, No stabbing blades, or murdring dags in brings, No banketting, nor phisicke poysonings: Nor no such parts, vile practises most euill, Bred first in hell, inuented by the diuell. But he sends to (Romes enemie) Pirrhus king A runnagate, a rogue, a periur'd slaue, A souldier of his owne, who promising Among Christians now a daies treasons are rewarded, and traitors succoured. By poyson, or some other meanes, in graue The Romanes should, Pirrhus,dead, see, or haue: Fabritius n'wold to this foule deede consent, But him fast bound, to Pirrhus prisoner sent. When Pirrhus saw the Romanes friendship, hee Could not obtaine by treaties, or reward, Determined by warre the end to see: The first use in Italy of Elephants in warre. With martiall men he stood vpon his guard, And Elephants to combat strong prepar'd: He was the first, to Italy that brought Those beasts, who bare m? on their backs that fought. But to encounter Pirrhus haughtie pride And mightie force, a noble Romane knight, Dentatus cal'd, with Romanes him beside, For Romes estate, who did not flye, but fight. They Pirrhus, and his power discomfit quight: Dentatus for his worthie valour showne, Had triumph braue, which through all Rome was knowne [illeg.] yeares are they made any conquestes abroad. Vntill this warre which Pirrhus lastly made, Fiue hundreth yeres the romaines had welnie Broyles still at home, and often ouerlayd With neighbours nere, people of Italie: Doubtfull their chaunce, and fortunes they did trie: The Latines oft, the Samnites, Toscanes, other, One gaining now, then loosing, straight the tother. But in the ende, their home warres brought to cease, Some vanquisht, some by truce, and friendship bound; Romes fame did now begin for to increase, Libia a province in Afrique, where Dido built Carthage. Against Carthage to make warre, meanes they found: A stately towne, seated on Libiaground: More auncient t'was then Rome, by many yeares, As by record of writers it appeares, CAP. 4. The first beginning of the warres with Carthage, Attilius Regulus chiefe Captaine taken prisoner, sent to Rome to treate for peace, but perswaded warre, returning to Carthage was put to death. Great was the fame throughout the world spread Of mightie Carthage, rich, exceeding fayre, Things at the highest, decaying highest. Whose wealth, and pompe, was cause her ruine bred, At such time when at highest in the ayre, Her glorie grew, then fell it to appayre. By which is showne, all earthly honours state, Fall of it selfe, or else brought downe by fate. Chiefe leader first of Romaines to this warre, Attilius Regulus had the onely charge; His army prest, no mishap could him barre, On shipboard came, with many a boate, and barge, And hoysing sayles, sea roome, and winde at large, Neede was there none, once for to ship an oare Vntill such time, they came to Afrique shore. Where taking land, such fauour fortune lent, Hauing first gotten a partie in the countrie. As in short space, they many citties tooke: With Carthage oft, all good haps backward went, Their force decreasd, and countrie them forsooke, Their chieftaines slaine, their souldiers durst not looke Out at their gates, so hard they were beset, And to triumph, naught did the Romaines let. From Carthage then Ambassadors did wend (For one, that could an armie rule and guide) To Lacedemon, who, did vnto them send A captaine stout, in warlike feates well tryed Xantippo namde, who neuer once denyed To fight for them, with all the skill he may, And Romaines force, to giue repulse or slay. But here (behold) of warre, the lot, and chaunce, The chance of battaile vncertaine. The Romaines had the ouerthrow in deede; They, who but late in triumphes did aduance, Doe flye, lye slaine, and wounded, some doe bleede: Who winneth oft, hath sometimes euill speede, Attilius tane, and many him beside, In prison pent like fortune to abide. And Xantippo of Carthage for his deede, Rewarded was, (wo worth wretches ingrate) Ingratitude most vile. To giue him giftes, and honour, they agreede, With louing speech, as seemed his estate: But little knew he, of their inward hate: Towards his ship, they brought him with glad cheare, And after, dealt with him as you shall heare. On shipboord come, they laude him to the skies, They murdered him, because at his returne, the hacedemonians should not glorie in the victory gotten by their Captaine. And taking leaue, doe leaue great giftes behinde: The Master, they did charge in any wise, All secretly t'agree vnto their minde; This thing therefore vnto him they assignde, That in the night, Xantippo the should slea, And after, drowne his carcasse in the sea. But (now) returne to Attilius againe, Whom Carthage kept in prison sure and fast, They did with him accord for to obtaine, The Romaines loue, and peace now at the last: And to forget all warre and discord past, Ambassadors to Rome they straight did send, Attilius with them must likewise wend. If the heathen held their worde in matters of life and death, how much more ought christians in smaller moments. But first they tooke an oath and made him sweare, For to returne their prisoner backe againe: (If loue and peace to them denyed were) And at their pleasure, so still to remaine. Attilius here, all promise breakers staine, Whose vowes &amp; words, are not performde in deedes; Fayre flowers in shew, proue but ilsauouring weedes. Ah Regulus, thy fame shall aye endure, Who free at home out of thine enmies hands, Wouldst not to liue in Rome, their peace procure, But rather chuse to lie in cruel bandes, For Countries cause to leaue lyfe, goodes, and landes: Thy constancie in word, and valiant minde, A patterne is for men of noble kinde. And where the Carthaginians, thought that he Would treate for peace, And the exchange of prisoners on both sides.perswaded otherwise The Senate, not to peace with them t'agree: Warre noble Romaines, Carthage peace dispise, By league with them, no profite will arise Romes state vnto, they yeeld, and he againe To Carthage went, and payd the price with paine: Where being returnd, he raunsome payd by death, For countries cause, which he did not refraine: Most cruelly they causd to stop his breath, By rolling of a barrell downe a mayne An hill most high, vnto his grieuous payne, Sped thicke with nayles, where he was closde within, Most cruelly piercing his tender skin. During this warre, good hap the Romaines had By Sea, at first, vnder their Consull stout Duillius, made Carthaginians glad To flie, and Hanno, Carthage Captaine. Hanno put into a doubt: Though truce of times was taken them throughout: Both secretly committing vnder hand, Vile partes at Sea, when peace was on the land. Yet in th'end, full peace tweene them tooke place: But long it did not last, for vnquencht hate Not cleane extinct, will secret worke disgrace: Daily practies of Machauellians And, so fares still the course of worldly state: Enuie, friendlike, with fayre smoth speech can mate His mortall foe, and deadly foes, we see, How ere in heart, outward seeme to agree. Such entercourse, tweene Rome, and Carthage was, Each other to conuince by pollicie: For twentie yeares, and vpwards, there did passe Strange stratagems, with many secrets slye: Ambition causde them many maystries trie, That, in th'end the peace was broken quight, and taking armes, the fall againe to fight. CAP. 5. The second warre of Carthage, by Publius Scipio, Hannibal the Carthaginian Captaine in Italie, his returne to Carthage, is ouercome and flieth. About this time Cornelius Scipio, Sardignia Isles, and Corsica, he tooke With other holdes the Carthaginians fro: This second war, most nere their welfare shooke, That forst they were about them for to looke: But Hannibal, who now their chiefetaine was, Brought them great hope, and much relieu'd their case. The cittie Sagunt, he besiegde most strong: Came into Spayne, and after into Fraunce, And with his armie, marched all among The Alpie Mountaines parting France and Italie, of a wonderfu'l height. hilles and lastly did aduaunce His ensignes, spread (so fortune leades the daunce) In Italy, the Romaines to pursue, Vext with home By the countries about Rome. warres, which done, began a new Stout Hannibal his warre; of which to reade His battailes three, against the Romaines won, Shall see, and heare of many a worthy deede, Three times he gaue the Romaines the repulse, and in the fourth, had a most mightie victorie. At large of him, by Rome, and Carthage done, But Hannibal, did cause his enmies shun Three times the field, the names, of places three: Tecyn, Trasimene, the third, floud Trebie. Quintus Fabius, Dictator was create, The Carthaginians force to stop or staye, His valour did withstand their running state, And Hannibal a while did keepe at baye: But after that againe, held on their way To Cannas field, where Romaines him withstoode, And, where the earth, was glutted with their blood. Such slaughter there, the Romaines did sustaine, As put all Rome, into a wondrous fray, Publius Scipio, the sonne of Cornelius Scipio, before rehearst. Deuoyd of hope, for euer to regaine, So great a losse, in minde to flie away, And leaue the citie at vncertaine stay: But Scipio young, of courage wise, and stout, Both comfort gaue, and draue away all doubt. Now Hannibal whom fortune fauour'd so, Had at command the countrie all Hannibal had al Italy at comm?dement. The countrie being fertile they surfeted with the fruites so that many dyed. about; The summer past, to winter he did go To Capua, with Carthaginian rout, Where idlenes infected valour stout: Abundance bred their bane, cloyd with delight: His armie all was welny orethrowne quight. But whilst he lay within Italia soyle, He Romanes force had welny vanquisht quight: Neere to the floud Metaurus by M.Liuius and C.C. Nero. Yet Asarubal receiu'd a mightie foyle By Romanes Consuls, that with him did fight, Bringing new succours for to reuenge the spight To Carthage done, whilst Hannibal with chance, By fortune might against Romes walles aduance. But Publius. Scipio this while stout, bold and wise, Whose valour great, is spoken of before, Had good successe in Which place was assignde to him for the warre. About this time his father and vncle were slaine in Iberia the Cathaginian wars. Spayne, whose fame did rise Throughout all Rome: and to augment it more, In getting Spayne, which place his father bore, And vncle both, to Rome did come at last, Where for desert, in Consulship was plast. His noble mind, bent to his cities good, Required Afrique might be him assignde, For publique weale to loose his life and bloud: But his desire impediments did finde: One who had bin oft Consull, Old Fabius sharply did resist his mind: Who gaue aduise rather at home to stay. Gainst Hannibal with force to take the way. But Scipio then contrarying Fabius will, Declar'd his mind in open audience The Senate too, to grant him their good will: Desire to reuenge his vncle &amp; fathers death. For it will proue by good experience, In Afrique if we fight for Romes defence, Neede will driue Carthage call home Hannibal: Who it denies, I know such hap will fall. For he who is their chiefest hope and stay, And he on whom their saftie doth depend, Long time they will, ne can, misse him away: So shall our warres in Italy have end: To his aduise the Senate did attend, Debating much, some loth, Of the Senate.yet was assignde For Carthage warre, which greatly pleasde his minde. But first to The common passage into Afrique &amp; nerest from Italy, where he was but slenderly furnished at first for such a war. Scicil Isle must take his course, And there prepare to furnish full his neede, To rig vp ships, t'abide the waters sourse: Prest in each poynt, away go'th he with speede, Though all the Senate scarse thereto agreede: Yet loe this warre grew to so glorious fame, As none so much encreast the Romanes name. So much preuail'd Scipio his vertue there, As Carthaginians gaine to losse did fall: By meanes whereof so hard beset they were, As Carthage towne was welny brought in thrall, Enforced to reuoke home Hannibal. The Senat now found Scipios saying true, Away, he went that meant Rome to subdue. Who then had for the space of sixteene yeares, Infested all Italia about: When he was sent for he had his armie before Rome walles. Put Rome and Romaines oft in deadly feares: And brought their state to many a dreadfull doubt, Deliuered now from troubles which did sprout And spring each day, by meanes of such a foe, Hannibal gone joy did expell all woe. But ere that he from Italie did passe, Carthage to Rome Ambassadors did send Subtil practises used generally now a daies For to have peace, which thing concluded was: Yet secretly their warres they did intend, Each kinde of way they did repayre and mend, Their armies that did armes and victuals want, Which warres among them had made very scant. But Hannibal no sooner was arriu'd, Hannibal, a sworne enemie to the Rom. by a vow at nine yeres of age, in the time of Amilcar his father. At Carthage tho, but did dislike the peace: Of hope he should be sure to be depriu'd, And purpose too, if that the warres should cease: Displeasde he seemde, but did his force encrease. Braue Scipio to meete vpon the field, Whose noble minde did neuer meane to yeeld. Their Armies tweene, light skirmish oft did chaunce: Hannibal was for victuals hard beset, He who but late to warre would needes aduaunce: Secret seekes peace, prouisions for to get, Obtaind, performde, conditions did not let On Carthage side, but people all cride out We are betrayde among these champions stout. Discord the signe of destruction. the plagues of common weales, and priuate messages And iarring thus themselues full oft among, Now taking truce, and then doe breake againe: They crie a fresh, these Captaines doe vs wrong, Whose outrage rulers seeke for to restraine: Things running thus, the magistrates are fayne The peace to breake, commaunding Hannibal To trie by fight, what fortune will them fall. Both armies lay each in th'others sight: King Massinissa, a King in the countrey, betrothed to the daughter of Asdrubal, giu? by the Carthagi. first to him, and after to Sysax, another King in the countrey there, to him maried, and after, Massinissa maried her againe, wh? for feare to be taken of the Romaines, poysoned her selfe. Malsinissa was on Romaines side: Who league with Scipio made before in spight Of Carthage, who denyed him his bride: (A noble mayde in prime of beauties pride) First his from them, but after did her mary Another to, the cause that made him vary. This ciuill strife with many others moe, The citie in, and countrie all about, Was cause at last of Carthage ouerthrow: In steede of reason, will, did rule the rout: Tweene magistrates also foule hate did sprout, Rage, insolence, and often death most vile: Thus foule reuenge did high, and low beguile. But Hannibal hearing of Romaines strength, Of Scipioes bountie, clemencie, and fame, His noble minde, with more, sought meanes at length To speake with him ere they to battaile came, It chaunst, and loe, furie seemde to enflame Hannibal, who, in wordes was somewhat tart: Threatning each other, a sunder they doe part. The time being come when both their armies met, Great was the slaughter made on either side: But Romaines did the victorie there get, Making their foes to dye with woundes full wide. Hannibal fled, he durst not longer bide: The losse so great, that Carthaginians craue Peace once againe, with Romaines for to haue. Scipio agreed, Romes Senate did consent: Whilest peace endured, many things did chaunce, Here to recyte, too long were verament; But Romaines did their honors still aduaunce, And Carthage welfare, backwardly did glaunce. Scipio to Rome returnde, did triumph gayne, And for surname, was called Africane: For that those warres attayned had such fame, And profite great brought vnto Romaines state, The countrey whole had Africa to name By him subdued, ordeynde thereto by fate: Thus time we see, brings all things to their date, The nature of time. Destroying oft, and raising vp againe, Yeelding some store, others doth pinch with paine. CAP. 6. The warres of the Romaines with the Macedonians, the conquest of Asia, the death of Scipio African, Romes Ambassador putteth the great King of Assiria in feare with his speech, the conquering of Macedonia and Dalmatia. Peace on this wise, again to Carthage granted: Rome had home-broyles, warres greater outward grew. The Macedonian King gainst Romaines vanted, Whose proude attempt, with Grecians to subdue, Quintus Flaminius, led forth the warlike crue Of Romaines, tho subduing that same King, And Grecians; all subiects to Rome did bring. He charge gaue to this King of Macedo, Phillip by name, neuer once warre to moue Gainst Romaine state, Nor to passe the limites of his conntrey.which he agreed vnto, Performing it with dutie and with loue: To Romaines he a friend did after proue, For ayde he gaue with all his power and might, When Romaines would at any neede to fight, Antiochus the great Assiria king, Came with great Into Greece. power, the Romaines to withstand: This Phillip then, most willingly did bring His force, and ioyn'de with those of Romaines band: Glabrio for Rome obtain'd the vpper hand. Antiochus fled to Egypt ward with speede, Raysing more force, to doe some other deede. Phillip, and he (t'is said) descended were From those, who, when great Alexander dead, Ciuill discord. the ouerthrow of the Macoionian Monarchie. In kingdomes did diuide his whole Empiere, Partage of which, great warres, and discord bred, Betweene all those to that succession led: With cruell fightes, each other long did thrall, As last, the Romaines came t'enioy them all. Thus Romes triumphing glorie high did growe, Her power was great by sea, and eke by land: With sack, and spoyles of cities they did flowe: Nations not any, might Romaines force withstand, Kings, and countries, far off did at their hand Desire ayde, amongst all which, did come Ambassadors from Egypt vnto Rome. Praying to guarde young Ptolomé their King, Now vext with warres, and like to haue the chase, With power which Antiochus did bring, From Kingly seate, and crowne him to displace: The Senate gaue consent to right his case, Sending vnto Antiochus, to cease His warre, and suffer Ptolomé liue in peace: Which he obeyde, but yet to haue a fleece Of Romaines spoyle, and to reuenge late spight, Did leade along his armie into Greece, Procurde by meanes of Hannibal, in fight From Carthage force, by Scipio put to flight (As is rehearst before) from whence he fled, Antiochus too, with succour to be sped. But into Greece, the Romanes Armie brought, Encountred him, Antiochus. with whom ‘was Hannibal: Orethrew th? both, &amp; brought their powers to naught: Here Carthage captaine had a second fall, Antiochus eke receiued a farther thrall: By sea also, Rome got the vpper hand, Expeld him thence into Assiria land. Lucius Scipio, was chiefe this warre that led, Brother vnto Scipio calde African: And for because so happilie he sped, The surname of Asiatique he wan: But speake againe of Scipio African, Lieutenant to his brother in this war, At his returne to Rome, there fell a iar. The Tribunes of the people, did molest Enuie the enemie to all vertue. Through enuie (sure) the glorie he had won: By meanes whereof, in quiet for to rest, From Rome he went, (their mallice for to shun) To A house or manor of his in the countrey. Lyterne, till their heate of rage was done: But there as some doe say (such was his chaunce) This worthy man, death wounded with his launce. Whose losse full many did lamenr, (no doubt) So braue a man to dye at such an age, For fiftie yeares he was not all full out: Thus doe we see, the valiant bold and sage, When time brings death, cannot withstand his rage, Rome happie thou, to breede so braue a wight, Vnhappie folke, his virtue so to quight. Hereby is seene the fruites of enuie still, Who ne're workes good, but euill euer more: Virtue she seekes for to destroy and kill, Things that are whole, she hurtes, and maketh sore, Those that are good, the enuious doe abhore: Which thing hath been, and euer more will be, Bright virtue blamde, by foule iniquitie. Where state and welth increaseth day by day, By valour of the vertuous, and the stout, Enuie there rootes, and takes such hold and stay, In secret wise, brauing among the rout: And with pretence each cause is good, (no doubt) Infecting sore such places that so florish, Vnder the cloake of virtue, vice doth nourish. With pollicie, and practise slie, they frame Their brasen face, and adders tongues to bite: They glose, and faine, and flatter without shame, With forged lies, they faith, and truth doe spite, And where as once their venym vile doth light, They doe not cease, to puffe with poysoned breath, Like Cockatrice, to bring them to their death. (Alas the while) so Rome did Scipio lose: During which time, Ætolia people were Taken, to be the Romanes vtter foes: But Marcus Fuluius. Fuluius, whose noblenesse was cleare, Subdued and brought them vnder Romanes feare: Thus still their fame, did euery day increase, Held warres abroad, at home the liu'd in peace. Antiochus, (who late rehearst before) To whom for ayde, stout Hannibal did flie: Enforst to keepe his countrey, and no more His fortune, with the Romanes force to trie: His kingly life, away from him did hye, Vnto the King (then) of Bythynia Hannibal went, for ayde on him to stay: Which thing when as the Romanes vnderstoode, To Prusias sent, (Bythinia King so hight) To render him, it should be for his good, If not, t'were meanes to worke him great dispight, The Romanes would redresse the wrong with might: Thus Hannibal, was nere his ending dayes, Whose noble acts won euerlasting praise, And fame beside, for euer during still: But foule dispayre, (did much appayre the same) In ougly shape who now came him vntill: Monster most vile, whose actes aye end with shame, With in his minde such deepe conceites did frame, As they alone Dispayre in distressed mindes, solitarie are not alone. together, musing sate Of glorie past, and now his wretched state. Hope banisht was, dispayre did bring in feare, And he fear'd most to fall in Romanes hands: Infernall plagues to earthly mindes distrest. When him before, most ougly shapes appeare: Hell seemed loose, and round about him stands, Griefe, sorrow, care, thought, miserie with bandes, Ruine, decaye, woe, wrack, and endles strife, Slaunder, disfame, and shame to rid his life. Enuie, reuenge, hate, discord, and disdayne, Mallice, and scorne, pride would not be behinde: The pride of Rome so pincht his heart with paine, Because reuenge did not fall to his minde: And now dispayre againe his eyes did blinde, (When as these furies, had his spirites possest, More greater yet, t'augment his great vnrest.) Shewed him his armies, and his victories, The rem?brauce of pleasures past, pincheth when penalte is victor. His glorious pompes, his triumphes, wealth and all Carthage great losse, how Rome did him dispise: The wracke eke of his brother Asdrubal, After all this, his owne mishaps, and fall From so great height, and lastly, now to light Into their hands, whom he did alwaies spight. Midnight was come, and euery thing at rest: When sightes yet strange, more monstrous did appeare, (As t'is with all by foule dispayre possest: Tost, and turmoyld, with horror, dread, and feare,) And long before the day gan for to cleare, In vision saw great battailes, thousands slaine, Huge heapes of dead, whose blood the earth did staine Before him seem'd t'appeare great flames of fire, Where in dispayre bad him goe end his life, Murder fast by (inflamde with rage and ire,) To kill him, readie with a bloodie knife: Waters to drowne himselfe and rid all strife: The Romaines hands t'escape, there is no hope; Hang thy selfe (quoth dispayre) here is a rope. Actes of distressed foules, possest by despayre, running through their sences. Beholde this chamber wherein thou doest lye: A thousand wayes there is to end thy woe, See there a tower stately, standing hye, Thy selfe from top thereof thou soone mayst throw, Here, stab thy selfe thy valour greate to show: Or cut thy throate, or braynes do knocke from head, No ioyes in lyfe, in best case when th'art dead. Dispayre at length the victory did gayne, And Hanniball did geeue consent to dye: Distressed he past hope, did thinke life vaine, With shame to liue, that late in honours hye Did sit, and now to dwell in miserie, With them who were his cruell deadly foes: He prayed dispayre some way else to dispose. His wretched life, those former meanes rehearst He liked not, (when sighing breath'd for ayre: Both head and heart, of Hannibal quick pearst) Then what saiest thou vnto a potion fayre? Hannibal poysoned himselfe. A bolle of wine, carrouse, drinke to despayre, Sorrowes are drie; this draught will quench all strife: Thus poysoned, he did leaue his loathed life. Ah wretched state, vaine worldes vading ioyes. High for to be, auailes nothing at all, Thy pompes and glorie, are but trifeling toyes, For record take we, worthy Hannibal, And many moe whom fortune hath made fall: She lifteth high, and smileth, when a frowne, Makes Cesar hop besides his seate and crowne. The ambition of antiochus, King of Assiria, who also would gouerne the King of Egipt, being but yet a childe, minding thereby to obtaine the kingdome to himselfe. Antiochus dead, Antiochus againe Succeeded him, who likewise vndertooke In Egypt, chiefe next to the King to raigne, Yet vnder age, his state to ouer looke: But th'Egiptians, would not this thing brooke, They seeing his sleights, and where about he went, To Rome in hast, once more for succour sent. Popilius Lenas charge the Senate fro, Ambassage went, with that great King to speake, By Romanes power, he coniur'd him to goe, And his great siege from Alexandria breake; Antiochus fear'd himselfe to be too weake, Desired time, to be aduis'd thereon To answer him, to stay, or else be gone. Popilius then a rod held in his hand, With haughtie looke beheld the King in face, And round about, in place where he did stand, A circle on the ground therewith did trace: Antiochus (quoth he) say on a pace, Ere I out of this circle set one foote; Straight answer me, delayes shall nothing boote. This Scarbrough warning put the King in feare, Romes Ambassador, feareth the great King of Assiria with a word. Which made him to Popilius straight agree, His siege forthwith in all the hast to reare, And Egypt all, to leaue in vnitie. By writers loe these things recorded be, To shew what might, and rule, the Romanes bare By destinie, or through their vertues rare. For at this time, their rule did stretch so farre, Inuading still the world euery where, Who did not yeeld themselues, the rod of warre Should draw out blood, and bring them vnder feare: The world, they seemde in sunder for to teare, Raigning alone, as soueraignes, and chiefe, As after here, it shall be shewed in briefe. Phillip King of Macedo (who but late Rehearsed is) ambitiouslie now bent, To liue as King within his owne estate, Did thinke himselfe too straight shut vp and pent, Of promise made before time did relent: League with the Romanes brake, and purposde warre If he had liu'd, but death his course did barre. But (loe) his sonne, His breach of promise punished after in his sonne, called Perseus, solicited by his nobles, after his fathers death, to take in hand this warre. that next him did succeede, Incited oft to take that cause in hand, As heyre vnto the warre, at last agreed, Of Macedons he raisde a mightie band: Emilius Paulus, did his power withstand, Orethrew his hoast, and prisoner tooke him tho With wife, and children, greatly to their woe. Return'd to Rome, triumphing with his praye, Where, for surname, Macedonique was cal'd Still after that, and from that selfe same daye, Macedo state to Rome was full instal'd, Dalmatia after, also was enthral'd By Nasica, Cornelius, so namde, Whose force was such, as he those people tamde. CAP. 7. The third and last warre of Carthage, when the City was quight subuerted andrazed to the ground. When time by fates, vnto his period reacheth, To top of wealth, or bottome of all woe, A rule most firme vnto the world teacheth, Nature, ne arte, can alter or forgoe, Vnlesse that he most high diuine say no: Who ruleth fates, who guideth time and all, Who builded first, and last shall make to fall. Sixe hundreth yeares and fower (now) it was, Since building first of noble Rome began. Carthage once more deuisde to bring to passe, To regaine that, which late the Romaines wan: Force they prepare, with all the speede they can, Their neighbours vexe, with Who at this instant gaue vnto th? a great ouerthrow, which weakened them sore to withstand this last warre. Massinissa King, The Romaines friend, and thus them selues they bring To vtter ruine: for now it was debated In Senate house, to saue, or to destroy Carthage, when at the last it was dilated For Romaines weale, to make cleare all annoy, After that time chiefe, magistrate, or roy, Should gouerne more, or dwelling there be found, Commission was, to raze it quite to th'ground. Bellonaes face now fround with tyrannie, Behold th'ambitions, rightly in their kinde, That to aspire, regardes no miserie, Or woes, or wracke of others, so their minde Ambition is neuer sufficed till death. Suffised be, which with a blast of winde Is ouerturnde, and vanisheth away, Not knowing how soone may come their own decay. But such the nature and condition, is Of earthly mindes,t'enioy what they delight, Forward to run, not thinking ought amisse, The wife foreseeth destinie, but fooles fall in their folly. Should them betide, or once their purpose spight, And certes we see, oft times doth run out right Without a stop, or any stay at all, Those things decreed, by destenie to fall. As here the Romaines, purposing this war. All doubtes debated, into Afrique sent To Libia coast, when Carthage saw a far Romes force, and knowing the Senates full intent, Amazde they were, now this, then that way bent: One part resolu'd their cittie to defend, With fame, their liues, and miseries to end. The league, of peace some seeke to hold, their ire Some sue t'asswage, and to that ende doe make A great n?ber of their Children according to the last trues. Long suites and plaintes: (and last with teares desire) Bringing pledges, in fauour them to take, But all in vaine, denied, with griefe they quake Distressed thus, prouisions all were scant, Of friends abroad, they had as great a want. Onely a few, but discord caus'd their wrack, When warres first gan, then brake they vnitie: One side, forwards did draw, the other back, Which thing now last, wrought all their miserie: Famine, with plagues, murder, and trecherie, Which to recure, was now (alas) too late, When first their folly, last brought their finall fate. Censorino, Martio, and Mamilio were Chiefe in this warre, who carthage first beset: Whose fortunes, for the space of foure yere Was losse most part, small honour did they get: Though toyle they tooke, in colde, in drie, and wet, Till Scipio young, who was th'adopted sonne Of Scipio, that before had Afrique wonne. Seem'd for to tread, and trace, the steps aright Of his great Vnckle, or else his Graundsire: For in these Carthage last warres, did acquight Himselfe so well, the army did admire His seruice there, a Trybune then no higher, Whose virtue did mongst them such glorie gaine, As sole Empire, by Romes voyce did obtaine. The people desired him for hope onely of the former, Scipio who conquered Afrique before. Ore all th'army at siege of Carthage tho: But thereto would the Senat not assent, 'The people by treaties desired so, Or else perforce, would cause them to consent: Clayming olde custome, lastly were content, Applauding much, their captaine newly chose, For Rome to fight gainst their long mortall foes. the true patterne of a most noble Captaine. When Scipio (thus) had of this warrefull charge, Within the campe, he framed orders new: In friendly sort, he made vnto them large A speach, commending of their valor true, Eke what requir'd, in souldiers to be due: Purging from them the vicious, idle all, Who through corruption, might th'armiethrall. Which done preparde by sea, and eke by land, For the assault, which to defend, with might The Carthaginians, lost time on no hand, But fought, and wrought t'offend by day and night: To Romanes they did many waies worke spight: But all in vaine, since fates would haue it so, That Romanes force, the citie should o'rethro. But like as time of euery thing makes end, So now of Carthage, fast came on the fine, Besiegde with out, with in themselues they bend Where Magistrates are not obeyed with a confusion commeth finall destruction. To iarre (alas) of vtter ruine a signe: Strength fayld, and with dispayre, they gan to pine: Yet long, and oft, they did the Romanes grieue, Whom Scipio by his valor did relieue. Succour by land and sea, from them he tooke, Brake downe the walles, entred the citie in: The end of disobedience to the Magistrates in a common welth, is many miseries. When terror (loe) the Carthaginians snooke, Like people mad, to runne the doe begin, In desperate case, to loose all, or all win, Killing, and kild, at length the Romanes gaine, The maistrie, and the citie to obtaine. Which to beholde, what heart but would lament, To see how Carthage stoode in wofull case, Her stately fort cal'd Birsa, torne, and rent, And houses sackt before the owners face: Huge flames of fire, rising in many a place, A woefull thing for to beholde with eye, Smoake dim the ayre, and flames to reach the skie. The nature of fury once conqueror. Great was the slaughter, made by Romaines all, In euery streete, ran murder, blood, and fire, The sillie babes, from mothers breastes doe fall, Husbands, and wines asunder doe retyre, Brothers, and friendes, and sisters, pay the hyre Of death, (alas) a griefe it was to see, The cities ruine, and their great miserie. Some with the sword, some midst the flame to burne: A spectacle most horrible to rue, The miserie of difordered people, euen their owne enemies, do often lament to beholde. Both magistrates, and people, dying, mourne, Of former welfare, their ilfare last to view: Scipio himselfe shed teares, with griefe that grew, To see the ruine of that citie olde, Late rich and fayre, welnie laid flat on molde. Continued had seuen hundreth yeares and more, Flourisht most braue, with plentie of each thing, On earth, nothing permanent. And had commaund, ore kingdomes, cities store, Rul'de eke by sea, as chiefe imperiall King, With store of ships, that riches home did bring, All in short space consumde, and ruinde quight, Subiect vnto blinde fortunes cruell spight. Which well may shew, the state of kingdomes all, Though nere so rich, so'populous and stout: But fortune can, and hath made them to fall, And welnie razde, both names and places out, Recount we will, some chiefe among the rout; What is become, of Troyes pompe and pride, Of Priam King, and all his power beside. Assiria that Monarchie so great, The Persian, Mede, and Macedonian King In battaile that Darius stout did beate, And all the world, did subiect to him bring, Carthage may here draw with them in one string: Thus worketh time, change, and chance, of each thing, Base, high to raise, more faster downe to bring. Thus Carthag (loe) came to her finall ende, Razde to the ground; to Rome rich spoyles were brought That were of choyse The image of Apollo, of fine gold pillars of golde, of the waight of 1000. talents, with innumerable other spoyles, besides those taken by the souldiers.and Scipio eke did send Scicilians too, braue statutes finely wrought, And ornaments, the Carthaginians, cought Long since from them, which antique were and olde, Which they by force, from them also did holde. In Rome was joy for this great victorie, With high and low, Scipio did triumph gayne, His prayses were extended to the skie, With peoples voyce, and sound of trumpes amayne, For surname (also) was giuen him Africane: Because an end he made of so great warre, Where by Romes gloriy strercht exceeding farre. CAP. 7. The conquest of Achaia, the razing of the city Corinth, warres in Portugall, Spayne, and with the slaues in Scicilia, the razing of Numanitia in Spaine. VVhen all these warres of Carthage ended were, Th'acayan people gathered head amaine, In Greece, and there an armie they did reare Against Romes state, whose brauing to restraine, Lucius Mummius Consull, leaue did gaine To fight with them, of Romes force was he chiese, Who them o'rethrew vnto their paine and griefe. Their countrey subject vnto Rome they yeelded, Corinth chiefe citie principall of Greece: Hundreth of yeares full many, had been builded, Lucius Mummius, had, for surname Achaique. With sack and spoyle, his souldiers did it fleece, Burning the same, left standing not one peece: And after razde the same quight with the ground, No dwelling left, in it for to be found. About which time, in Portugall there was, A person stout, Viriatus cal'd by name, But meane of birth, yet so it came to passe, Portugall subiect to Rome. That from a shepheard, grew to so great same, And with his force, the Romanes oft did tame, But he by treason slaine, and not by fight, Which causd that countrey, fall to Romanes right. Not far from thence, in Spayne a town did stand, Numanitia cal'd, which long time warres did hold With Romanes force, fighting with equall hand: Both one, and other, gaynde as fortune would: The Romanes tooke disdaine, a poore towne should Braue them so long, and not to haue it tane: Thither was sent stout Scipio 14. Yeares after Carthage destroyed, and in the 1622 of Romes foundation. African, At whose aproach, disorder great was found The army in, that at the siege did lie, Which he reformde, and then by trumpets sound, With sharpe assault Numantiaes force did trie: Did take the same, the people mercie crie, His souldiers spoyl'd, and sacked euery place, And afterward did clearely it deface. About this time within Scicilia isle, When the foote will rise against the head, cut it off on the ground, any more to tread. Bondmen, and slaues, did make a great vprore, Them to appease was vsed many a while, Their number did increase, still more and more: But yet an armie, was rais'd vp before, For to subdue their power and their strength, Whom Consul Fuluius pacified at length. CAP. 9. The second warres in Asia; the death of Scipio African: Warres with Iugurth King of Numidia, and warres in Germanie, France, and other places. Soone after this, in Asia warre was mou'd, On the behalfe of Attalus the King, Who by his will had giuen to be prou'de, His kingdome, crowne, and euery royall thing, The Romanes too; but one a plea did bring Against that case namde Aristonicus: But Rome replyed, and brought an action thus: With armed men to trie the matter out: Aristonious orecome, and brought to yeld; Perpenna Consul with his Romane rout Captiued him, in battaile on the field; In the yeare of Rome, 625. Which yeare following, to death (too soone) did yeeld Scipio, as he within his house tooke rest, Strangled t' was thought, by some whom he lou'd best. Not much aboue fiftie sixe yeares of age, (Loe valiant wightes, foule fortunes cruell spight) Rome was perplext with dolor, griefe, and rage: Both the other, Scipio and this, dyed in the flower of their age. And as some write, in skies appear'd a sight, It's said the sonne kept not his course aright, How ere it was, the losse was great to Rome, So time brings too, all earthly things their doome. In France ensuing, after this also, The Consull Fabius gain'd a battell great: And Gracchus, Tribune of the people, tho A man most rare, on matters graue to treate, By Enuies rage, some did him cruell threate: For slaine he was, about diuiding lands: The wise we see, cannot shun malice hands. And now began the warres of Iugurth stout, Iugurth K. of Numidia, a countrey in Afrique, appertaining sometime to the Carthaginians. Which Salust doth at large most plainly show, Where may be seene great matters brought about, And of the rest before past on a row In other workes, who will them reade may know: Why this small worke was writ, one cause was chief, Romes rising high to be declar'd in brief. But Iugurths warre, (which next did fall in chase) Calphurnius. Calphurnius first did take the same in hand, Who Consull was, and after him had place Cecilius Metellus, strongly mand: But lastly Marius, with his warlike band Orethrew his host, with many a deadly wound, Ending the warre, had Iugurth prisoner bound. During which warre with this Numidian king, The Germanes high, and low, gan to molest Slaughter and ouerthrowes of the Romaines, by the Germanes. Italia soyle, and mightie troopes did bring, In France also, that countrie to infest: The Romanes had by them vnquiet rest, Great slaughter oft, amongst them they did make, Chief Captaines many, were forst their liues forsake. But Marius, Consull foure times now chose, Gaue them repulse, and last their power orethrew: The Almanes hie, were slaine and soone did lose, At Aix in Prouence, where their strength they drew: In Lombardie, at Lysieres, did rue The other sort, which done, afresh did grow New warres, that ouer all Italie did flow. Those people that vpon the soyle did dwell, In sundrie partes, which often heretofore Be nam'de, The Latines Samnites, Toscanes, Veientes, Eques, Falisques, and others, now such countries as are about Rome, Florence German, Mantua, Fynam, Sieana, and others.began againe for to rebell: With much adoe appeasde was their vprore, And being reduc'de to quiet, as before: Swift time that doth begin, and end all thing, A dangerous warre, against Romes state did bring. CAP. 10. The warres with Mithridate King of Pontus, upon which grew the ciuill warres in Rome, betweene Sylla and Marius: of warres in Portugall, and the vtter ouerthrow of Mythridate the great, King of Pontus. In Kingdomes rule, most strange is fortunes chance, Fleeting, vnsure, not to be thought with hart: Euents each day, both to, and'fro, do glance: Sores thought well salu'd, els where vnknowen do smart Trust treason proues, and plaies a tragique part With secret sleights: Ambition worketh wiles, Faith proueth fraudes, and friendships are but guiles. Mythridate King of Pontus, valiant, stout, With armie strong, did giue two Kings the foile, Gaue them the chase, their seate and kingdome out: One of Two countries in Asia Bythinia, the other of the soyle Of Two countries in Asia Gappadoce, their countries both did spoile: Which warre, so sore the state of Rome did trouble: First strife, next hate, and after murders double. These wretched Kings distressed thus with woe, In league and friendship, were with Romanes knit Vnto their aide, perforce did drive them The Romanes. to: But here marke fortune when she list to flit, Who frowning seemde, on Romanes side to sit, For warres abroade, to hurt them did begin, And iarres more ill, at home themselues within. Strife did arise two captaines stcut, Which after grew to warre, and deadly wound: Ciuill discord, the one'y mischiefe of all commonw althe, &amp; which bringeth therein, destructions, sooner then any other plague. Note here the fruites sedition bringeth out, And where likewise ambition taketh ground: The bodies sicke, whereas the heades vnsound. Rome had good cause to looke both pale and wan, Neuer so plagude, since first their state began. Stout Mythridate with kings chase not content, But farther runnes, into the Romanes land; Long t'was before the Senate could consent, Who for this warre, as leader chiefe should stand: Contenti? cause of hate and reuenge. On partes they were, on this side, and that hand, Sylla some chose, because of noble race, Some Marius, rather to supply the place. Betweene these two, began Romes wofull state: (Here may be seene what ciuill discords breede) Sylla had prest his armie at Romes gate, Marius constrain'd to flye away with speede, Perforce was such, and so hard grew his meede, In a small boate, as fast as he could hye, To Afrique coast, away from Rome did flye. So Sylla had of Pontus warre the charge, And thither marcht with Mithridate to fight, One poison driuen out by another, and yet the griefe not cured. Absent from Rome: Cynna, whose power was large That time Consull, began the state to spight, Stirring vp strife, but was soone put to flight By Octauian, who in office with him was, Out of the citie to Cynna gaue the chase. Marius on this returned from exile, His power with Octauian did vnite, In Rome committing many parts most vile: the fruites of ciuill discord. Wrong bare the sway, and did orepresse the right, Murder, and theft, was done in open sight: They Consuls chose, and did what ere they lust, Their will was law, that euery thing discust. Sylla this while in warre gainst Mithridate, The Romanes losse, in part did get againe: Hearing of Romes foule broyles and troubled state, Fast homeward hied, to ease that grieuous paine: A quiet state the meane while. And when he had, for most orecome and slaine His enemies, that gainst him did resist, Bare sway alone, and then did what he list. Thus one gap stopt, a worser breach is made, One tempest past, a fouler storme doth rise: One drowning scapte, a gulfe more ill to wade: True is an olde saying, seldome comes the better. One ill foreseene, a vilder blinds the eyes: One foe found out, a crueller lurking lyes: One canker heal'd, out breakes more pestlent sore: Marius was ill, Sylla could be no more. For when the winde tempestuously doth blow, Oreturning towers, houses trees and all: Those harmes past ore, incontinent doth flow A mightie floud, by raine continuing fall, Drencheth vp beasts on fields, and in the stall, Drowning both corne, and fertile medow ground, One common losse doth make a grieuous wound. Marius windlike at first did blow and rage, Which tempest little calm'd, scarse ouerpast: Sylla not bent, that so it should asswage: But after blasts, brings flouds of raine as fast, The woolfe full pancht, the beare take his repast: Who hunger bides? but weaker beasts among The rauening sort, opprest by open wrong. Sylla his en'mies sharply did pursue, Some banisht were, and on their goods set price, Their children eke that after should ensue, He quite despoyl'd for euer to arise Office, or rule to beare in any wise: Reuenge ioyned with ire. No man what ere might safe enioy his state, Or life, if once against him he bare hate. So farre forth was his heart enflam'd with ire, Marius being dead, part of his carkasse tho, (Such furie did his raging mind inspire) He causde into a riuer to be throw: Behold revenge to mortall men a foe, Neere satisfied, vntill she haue her will, Of will restrainde, with griefe her selfe doth kill. Thus Sylla got the victorie at length, Dictator made, and had the chiefest place For to command, and now againe in strength: Rome gan to grow, and mutinies to race, But yet farre of, an Exile in disgrace With Sylla, nam'de Prescribed by Sylla Sertorius stout and fierce, With warre did seeke the Romanes state to pierce. In Portugall an armie he did wage, Got many townes, in warres hauing great skill: For to appease this vnlookt for outrage, Pompee had charge, to worke therein his will: Betweene these two, each part much bloud did spill, After great fights, Sertorius was slaine In treason foule, with craft caught in a traine. A few yeares after, Pompee this had wrought, All Spayne he got, and in that time also Bythinia king, to earth by death was brought, Heire to his crowne, he made the Romanes tho: But Giving many ouerthrowes to the Romans, during the ciuill warres Mithridate king of Pontus sayd no: Who occupied Bythinia all the while, That Marius, and Sylla, made the broyle. Against whose pride, Lucullus Consull went And foyld him oft, speeding so at the last, His armie all in piecemeale cut and rent, And from Bythinia made him bye in bast, In Pontus bounds, shutting him vp full fast, From whence also, in fight was driuen away, Flying for ayde to the king of Armenia. Lucullus still did after him pursue, And oftentimes with both the powers did fight Of those two kings, who thought for to subdue Lucullus force: when each in others sight Were come, the Romanes oreprest them by might, The Kings enforsed to forsake the field, Their people most were slaine, and fled, some yeeld. But here by meanes of mutinie and jarre In Romanes campe, which did Lucullus let, With Pontus king to make an end of warre, Whereby he might the gaine of glorie get, The Senate did a message send to set Lucullus Liued often most sumptuouslie, &amp;c. Not medling any more in matters of the commonwealth. home, and in his roome did place Pompee, those warres of Mithridate to chase. Who late before, Pompee great fame and credite gainde, In vanquishing by sea the nauie strong Of Pirats stout, who had with power attainde The Soueraigntie of all the coasts along From Spayne, to Nere vnto Constantinople, or beyond, which compasseth the one side of all Europe. Helle spont, there all among Those Isles: yet further did their force extend By land also, which Pompee brought to end. The ouerthrow of whom did much preuaile, For Romes welfare, and for the common state: So hard beset till then, they could not saile Out from their shores: but brought now to this rate, Pompee prepar'd himselfe for Mithridate, To Asia sped, making his power there strong, Those warres to end, which Rome had vexed long. Which entred too, he prosecuted so, As in short space, Mithridate was bereft Of hope, for ere to rise his state vnto, When once his forces were asunder left, Small was the succour tho vnto him cleft: For after being besieged by his sonne Pharnaces cal'd, his life he yeelded done, Killing himselfe. O fury foule despayre Vnconst?cie of mind in miseries, engendreth dispayre. That doest inspire, thy selfe in soules distrest: But, what is life, say such? a blast of ayre: Foule honors seate, chiefe cause of great vnrest. The meane estate is ten times happier blest. O pride of Rome, Ambitions patterne left, Romes ambition still continueth. Which neuer will from following race be reft. But yet a while, behold this mightie king Stout Mithridate, how fortunes frowning spight, Did at the last, his warres and conquests bring To wretched state, that fortie yeares with might, Most valiantly did with the Romanes fight, And victor oft, their Captaines many led With him each where captiu'd, so well he sped. Treasons he scapte, and murmurings many a one: Of body strong, to walke on foote, or ride; No wound did euer make him shrinke, or grone, To shun the warres, at any time or tide: Gaynst poysoning, he poyson did prouide, Wherewith when as he would his life haue ended, No power at all, by poyson was extended. His sonne (as is rehearst) Pharnaces nam'de, Vsurping now his crowne and dignitie, Mythridate saw his wracke in such sort fram'de, Fearing to fall, in farther miserie, Into the Romaines hands by trecherie, Drew forth the venim, which he euer bare About his sword, began it to prepare. Two of his daughters being fast him by, Did pray the King that they might first of all Take taste thereof, the potion for to trie, (Loathing their liues to see their fathers fall) He would not yeeld, but they would needes enthral Themselues to death, and dranke and present dyed, The selfe same thing, by Mythridate was tryed But would not worke, his body long before By this King, was inuented the triacle now vsed, called by his name. He so prepar'de, against all poison strong, For to withstand all treason, enuie bore Against his state, who sought all meanes by wrong T'abridge his dayes, but fortune made him long Happie to liue, vnhappie for to die, From Empire so to fall in miserie. Vanquisht with griefe, which long before his hart, Ne bodie could, the Romanes legions great Orecome, by practise, policie, or art, Friends, and his souldiers forsooke him, by meanes of his son who vsurped the crowne. And now (quoth he) loe what doth me most freate: Faithles souldiers, children vnkind entreate Me too, my friends vnfaithfull to me are: These foes I flye, rather then life to spare. Vnto a Duke that stood vnto him neere, (Quoth he) to me thou euer hast been iust, From liuing any longer rid me cleere, Lest Romanes tread my glorie in the dust, Ore me a king to triumph as they lust: Since poyson will not end my wretched life, Helpe me by bloudie stroke to cease all strife. The Duke bewayled Mithridate with teares, Yeelding his helpe, to rid him of his woe: To his right breast, with trembling hand he beares The bloudie blade, that did his life vndoe: Mithridate with a stroke, draue it into His breast, when as the liuely sprite outbrast: Thus this great king, fortune with spight downe cast, What therefore bootes long life with troubled state, Though riches, wealth, and honor men possesse? The longer life, the greater strife. What doth auaile long life, without debate, In pleasure, ioy, neuer to feele distresse? In weale, or woe, let life be more or lesse, Death is all one, at first, as tarie long, Since dye we must, mid woes small ioyes among. CAP. 11. The disturbance of Romes estate by the conspiracie of Catiline, Ierusa'ems tribute to Rome, warres by Iulius Cæsar in Germany, France and England, by Pompé the King of Egypt was restored to his kingdome. Like as the day (when fresh Aurora spreds Her curtaines large) expelling darke nights shade: Bright Phœbe doth rise from chamber and vnbeds Himselfe abroad, with blasing rayes, doth glade Aslant the earth: where length of shadowes made: By mistie cloudes, all vanish quite away Rough winds arise, it proues a stormy day. Through heate perhaps, a thunderclap may sound: Or els rough Æol raise a mightie wind, With flouds of raine fast powring on the ground: That heards of cattell scarse can finde Shilter to saue their bare backs (thinly linde) The weakeft alwaies goes to the wall. When as those beasts that feeding lye in stall, Recks not the storme, how great so ere it fall. So fareth fates: faire weather now foule proue, Stormes past, there comes a quiet calme againe, Seasons and times such earthly chances moue: So Romes high state now whole, then sicke with paine. In worldly life, cares be our daily gaine: Ciuill strife a destroyer. Lawes, for the good of common weales firme seated, Through ciuill strife their right vse are defeated. As Pompee had those broyles and iarres late ended, Seditious fire began to light againe: Now Catiline by Gathereth a crew, discontented through idlenes and voluptuousnesse.coniuration bended A number moe (their countries peace to staine) The state of Rome to spoyle, ambitious braine: But Cicero who Consull was that time, Detected them of that most heynous crime. But Catiline Toscane came by flight, Gathering fresh crewes of wretches all forlorne: Gainst whom Anthonius, (Consull) went to fight, The reward of rebelious person,disturbing the quiet estate of the common wealth By whose great valour in pieces cut, and torne The rebels were, (unhappie wretches borne) But fates to men, doe aye alot such chance, That by wrong meanes, themselues thinke to aduance. And in this yeare fine Cicero Consull was Ierusalem, and all Iudea land, (Great Pompees Power atchieu'de and brought to passe) Did tribute pay vnto the Romaines hand: Octauian eke as you shall vnderstand, (Who Emperour was in processe following here) Receiu'de his birth, at Rome in this same yere. Fiue yeares after Gabinius, and Piso Consuls were chose, when as the A people in GermanieSwysers bold, Did cast their course, by A Country in France very fruitefullProuence for to go Farder in France, whereas they ment to hold Their biding place (say nay who so would) By reason of the fertile soile and ground, Great foyson there of fruites, in season found. Whom to forbid t'abide or there to rest, Iulius Cæsar raisde an armie strong, Julius Cæsar, his first charge in warre in Germanie. Commaunded by the Senate Soone was prest: And in short space the Swysers came among, Their power most dead, on earth he laid along, And after that to Arioust also, An Almane King he gaue like ouerthrow. Besides these two, he other battailes fought, In parties moe of Germanie, and France, Cæfar fertunate in al his warres Neere riuer Rhyn, his enemies he brought Subiect, which farre his glory did aduance: From thence with power, ore Ocean seas did glance, And did arriue among the Brytanes then, Cæsar in England. With whom to fight, he found them matchlesse men: But yet in fine, he did subject that Isle Ere he return'd, and letters thence did write To Rome, (which were conueyed in short while) Letters written to Rome from England The first day of September to recite, To Cicero, which he receiu'de in sight Vpon the nine and twentith of the same: From England, in a month those letters came. Cæsar from thence return'd againe to France, Had good successe, the countrie quiet brought Ere it was long, thus fortune' can aduance, Those whom she meanes at length to bring to nought: About this time, th'egiptians Rome besought To aide their king, expeld his countrie fro By Archelaus, worker of his woe. Vnto the Senate Pompee sute did make, The king distrest, for to restore againe: Gabinius charge thereof Commanded by the senate or councellmust vndertake, He Archelaus, perforce did constreine For to depart, vpon a grieuous paine: So The noble mind of Pompee to distressed Princes Ptolome receiu'd againe his crowne, And royall seate, by Pompees high renowne. CAP. 12. The Ciuill warre betweene Cæsar and Pompee Cæsars quieting, the state of Egypt, his quicke expedition through diuers other countries his attaining to the Empire. Like as two Lions long without their pray, And comming where they hunger may sustaine, Both being fierce, they will agree no way In friendly sort, to part the spoile in twaine, High stomackt both, both thinke the whole to gaine, Doe fall at strife, one for the others part, Where one, or both, doerue their rage with smart. This ciuill warre which now began to rise Tweene Cæsar stout, and Pompee cald the great: Sheweth lion like, the grudge that smothring lies Where reuenge taketh roote, nothing but death can supplant it Within the heart, which canker like doth eate: Vntill such time reuenge, breakes out in heate, And sets on fire, from smoake vnto a flame, Neuer extinct without some foule disfame. Hate will build on a small ground to be reuenged This ground whereon this grudge began to grow, The cause thus fell, stout Cæsar was reiected Consull to be, vntill he did bestow His armie, and his office last elected: But hate hath meanes, that spight shall be detected, Although small cause important thereto long, Right set aside, bate workes by open wrong. But this conceipt Cæsar held in his mind: To yeeld his strengthes, then naked should he bee, Where now before, might hap then come behind: Yet neuerthelesse, ye yeelded to agree, If Pompee would, release as well as he, His power also, which Pompee would not yeeld. Cæsar Hasted to France againe, and from the field Bronght on his armie, came in Italie: Tooke many townes by loue, and composition: Pompee this hearing, with Consuls both did flie, Cæsar pursued, (there was no prohibition) But ere he came, to make with them condition, Embarqute they were, on sea boord, vnder sayle And out of sight, might bid to them alhayle. For want of ships to serue his warlike turne, He thought not good there long while for to stay: But backe againe to Rome made his returne From Durazo, (from whence they fled away) At Rome held court long after, day by day, Framing complaints, gainst those that did him wrong, And offring peace the Romane state among. He perceiuing the Senate made small count Of what he spake, from Rome in hast he sped: And ere t'were long at Or Marcellis, a towne in France, lying betweene Spayne and Italy, on the sea coast. Marcels did dismount, Whereas the towne gainst him did make head: But he by sea an armie caus'de be led, Left it besiegde by water, and by land, And into Spaine did iourney out of hand: Where Pompees captaines did vnto him render, With all their forces, at his commaund to bee, And with them hasted, whereas hope was slender, At Marseiles towne, ere he came sought t'agree And yeeld to him, which done, way goeth hee To Rome againe, and in his absence was Dictator made, (through fates so brought to passe.) Parly through feare of further trouble. The people (eke) the more to raise his fame, Elect him Consull, with Seruilius matched: And when he had set euery thing in frame, For publike weale, to And Pharsalie where they foughtThessalie dispatched, And there a time to fight, with Pompee watched, Did him orecome, slew all his power welnie; Pompee enforst to Egypt for to flie: Where raigned then, Ptolome his sonne that late, (Before rehearst) by Pompees meane who was, Restorde againe into his royall state, In hast by flight Pompee to him did passe, In hope he would with curtesie (alas) Requite with aide, and succour, at his neede Him now distrest, for that his former deede: But he to whom, Pompee this pleasure did, Was dead, and now this King was but a childe, Who scarcely would to Pompee welcome bid: Of hope and succour being thus beguilde, Ingratitude, (who is a monster vilde) Within the harts of the Egyptians grew, Doubting mishap, in treason they him slew. Vile wretches that durst on him so lay hand, Whose noble hart relieu'd your wretched state: Did you not feare, the breach of league and band With Romanes made, but could ye him so hate That was your friend, though destinie and fate Did on him trowne, so in his bloud t'embrue Your cruell handes: but you his death shall rue. Cæsar shall not let vnreuenged goe, Your barbarous part, though he his enemie bee: The day shall come wherein you shall crie woe, Ruying your state with wracke, and miserie, For doing of so foule a villanie, In killing him, the worlds flower chiefe, Whom Cæsar (loe) bewailes with teares, and griefe. Presenting of his head, thinke you to finde Pardon, and peace? no, no Egyptians base Sprong from the stocke of some vile rascall minde: No maruaile though like rogues the world ye trace, Let not the earth affoord you byding place; But wander ye, as wretches all forlorne, Your ofspring curst, and those before you borne. No doubt those plagues shall light vpon you all: The Romanes who your kings oft succour gaue, Shall raze their seate, and euer after thrall Their name, and make both king, and queene a slaue, And farther yet, this curse eke shall you haue, Craft, and deceipt, and theft shall be your trade, Vntill the gallowes, end of all haue made. Ah worthy wight, Pompee the Phœnix rare, Starre of the world, before and euer since: Both memorie, and fame, shall aye declare Pompe but young, yet a great conqueror. Thy noble artes whose prowesse did conuince, Full many a realme, and prouince, king, and prince, At twentie fiue yeares age being no more: What one did euer match thee since, or before. For noble mind, for valour, bountie loue, Whose good successe did raise the Romanes state: For constancie which mishaps could not moue, For honour show'de to wretched Mythridate, Himselfe his race, to many in like state: Thy vertues blazde thy noble disposition, But cruell mindes, made there of prohibition. The stately triumph Rome did make to thee, Declarde thy fame, when thou didst backe returne With captiu'de kings conquer'd, thy victorie As bright as sunne, or blazing lampe did burne: Which sight to see, made them with griefe to mourne, When in a chariot shining bright, all gold, Set rich with stones, their eis might thee behold. To sit, and when their scepters, and their crownes, There was counted to be in siluer 2200. talents, after our account in money, an infinite some. Their royall roabes, with ornaments, and all Their stately wealth, their jewels, spoyle of townes, Siluer, and gold, with statues high and tall Of beaten gold, yet more to shew their thrall: Their armours, and their weapons, broad in sight, They prisoners all, orecome by thee in fight. Besides prisoners there were 314. pledges, children of Kinges, and great Princes of countries by him ouer come, shewed in the triumph, with the images &amp; pictures of those slaine in battaile, to represent his victories. Triumphing thus, with much more in like sort, Romes youth went first, next them the youthfull crew Neere mans estate, then followed with great port, Graue citizens, next Senate did ensue Clad in their roabes, of colour bloody hue: Many sortes moe of people in their place, Before and after, in triumph then did trace In order due: Those of his armie strong, Some chiefe, on horsebacke, some on foote did goe, Neuer the like triumph there was among Romes conquerours, for any ouerthrow, That giuen was to countrie, or to foe, Yet (loe)(alas)such was his destenie, Hated by friends, and slaine by trecherie. What mindes haue men in honours seate that sit, High still to clime, not knowing how soone they may When dread is least in daungers greatest flit, And being once fallen, soone wither and decay, On mightie trees growes sundrie sortes of spray, Whose rootes turn'd vp, the danger is not small, Wh? tumbling down comes bark, boughs, twigs, &amp; all. Pompee euen so oreturn'd by cruell fate By such as should haue him their succour lent, His friends who loue did beare vnto his state, Branches, and boughes, firme fixt to him and bent, Were after ward cut off, scattred, and rent, As here ensuing shall be shewed in place, If well you note, this high imperiall chace. Cæsar pursued, and into Egypt came With power great, the king that time in armes, A quarrell had his sisters pride to tame Cleopaira, (for shunning future harmes) On either part there was ofttimes alarmes, Which to appease, Cæsar did them incite Fore him t'appeare, as Iudge the cause to right. In that he was Consull of Romane state: And for before the former king that dyde Did league contract, (assenting to a rate) The Senate with, in friend ship to abide: But th'Egyptians, with disdaine did slide From this offer, tooke it in great disgrace, Their king to pleade, before a Consuls face. Whereon in armes they drew them out of hand, Sought meanes Cæsar, like Pompee to orethrow: But he withstood them with his warlike band, In dangers great: yet last did make them know He Cæsar was, for victorie did blow Vpon his side, the king dead, he diuided Egypt in two, and thus it was contriued. Cleopatra, ioynde with her younger brother, Should both enioy the state and dignitie, The one to be as mightie as the other, Subiects to Rome, euer after to bee: This done, Cæsar departs, and after hee Transportes his force, and armie out of hand, With speed most swift into Affyria land. To Pontus next, and there the king orethrew, The greatnes of mans minde, atchieueth many enterprises, thought vnpossible, which proueth true, that a man is but his minde. Pharnaces nam'de, the sonne of Mythridate, (Rehearst before) and afterwards he drew Armenia too, and quieted that state: With Gallogreece, assigning them a rate. Cappadoce, Pont, Bythinia also, Romes league on paine of death not once forgoe. This done, to Rome fast making his returne, The season cold, in winters shortest dayes: Desire of rule so made his heart to burne, Setting a part all manner of delayes, From Rome, to Scicill Isle, and there not stayes, Cato flew himselfe at Vtica, a city in Afrique for that hee would not fall into Cæsars hands. But taketh ship and sayles to Afrique coast, With great desire t'en counter his en'mies hoast. Pompees allies: amongst whom, Cato graue With other moe, had raisde an armie great To take their parts, king Iuba, a King in Afrique, his league with Rome. Iuba they doe craue, Who did consent with them his foote to wet, In doing of which he was set by his seate: For Cæsar had ore them the victorie, The great'st part slaine, the rest away did flie. In his own person, ere he attayned the Soueraigntie of Emperor, hee had made war in three parts of the world, viz, Asia, Africa &amp; Europe, and from them all, returned victor. When Cæsar had ended this chase of warres, Returning backe, triumphing with great spoyle, In euery place made peace, and ceast all iarres, And to his enemies giuen vtter foyle: To Rome he came, and resting now from toyle, He triumph had, and did command each where The world throughout, all nations did him feare. Now here behold Romes Empire soueraigne, Whose fame doth yet continue to this day: The name of Cæsar still it doth retaine, And euer shall vntill the worlds decay: The Scriptures by the Prophets so doe say, No sooner full sea, but ebbe beginneth. Interpreted by learned clerkes diuine: But now at height, note how it did decline. CAP. 13. The wounding to death of Iulius Cæsar in the Senate house. When bloud, when fire, wh? slaughter, spoyle &amp; sack, Ambition cause of many miseries. Throughout the world had run to raise Rome hye, (Alas) what woe, what miserie, and wrack, (Vile wretchednes, and torments cruelly Her Empire causde, causles many to dye) Through treasons vsde, with subtiltie and craft, And slye deceits since in the world laft. But richly clad in throne Imperiall, (As Phœbe in skies with maiestie doth shine) Cæsar did sit, and in his hand the ball, Or globe did hold, for token or a signe, (As say he might the world all is mine) Sole to command, no match or mate had he: Such was his minde, gaining sole soueraigntie. Honers seat full of dangers. But here began hate, enuie, and disdaine, The Monarch new, his greatnes to despise, His equals late, now vassals, he to raigne Alone, and they, as base before his eyes: High minds, secret, the furies made to rise: Not priuatly pretending of his harmes, Nor publikely banding with men in armes. Wh? dread is least, then is danger greatest. But as he in th'imperiall seate did sit In parliament, not dreading ought at all, Pricks forth reuenge, his enemies all fit: The tree high growne with fatall axe to fall, Least that his boughs, spred large with shade might thrall Small vnder trees, and wood that grew him neere, Purpose pursued, they would no longer beare. Vnto him came in number eight or nine, Each one a dagger, bodkins some doe say: What ere, but there, the thred they gan t'vntwine Of that great A relation to the fourth staffe in the first Chapter of this bookewebbe, begun so many a day Before, and now iwoue, begins away To weare and fret, by piecemeale rag'd and torne, As at this day base Bashrags The Turkes.doe it scorne. Thus sunke the ship that floted with full saile, Through stormes stird vp by furies plagues of hell: Thus worthy Cæsar worlds rule bids alhaile, Leauing the trumpe of fame, his praise to tell: His vertue flyes, his name, mongst vs to dwell: Vpon this globe what glorie more can be. Vertue, acts, name, left to eternitic. CAP. 14. The fortunate and prosperous raigne of Octauius Augustus Cæsar, in whose time our Sauiour Christ Was borne. Summer the ripener of al fruites When Summers heat, with parching flames had burnd The earths fresh coate, deckt sweet by Flora queene, Whose colours gaye, to russet browne was turnd, Through drought, fire hot, each pleasant field was seene Bare backt, deep scortcht with chawnes, in steede of green Ceres vncrownde, her garland withered ripe, Pan, haruest home to Swaines, had playd with pipe. Autum, the gatherer &amp; storier. Fruites falling fast Autum the same did hye, Cleare dayes began to be o'recast with cloudes, Turning to mists, and raine descends the skye: Birds couerts seeke, and beasts together crowdes Close from the cold, in house by fire shrowdes The rustique sort, and greater swaynes beside, Content perforce the winters wrath to bide. Whilst chilling colde with many a bitter blast, Disroabes the trees, and bating quight the ground, Winter the destroyer &amp; spender. When Saturne with his cruell lookes doth cast A mantle thicke, the colour seene and found White euery where, (but skies blacke) low all round This globe vpon, and when's depending seene Trees leau'd with yce, in liew of Sommers greene. When whistling windes do sheere the tender skinne, And razor like, piercing, doth make a raze On seelie creatures, barely clad, and thinne, Nye staru'de with cold, looking with ruefull grace, Doe wish the spring to hasten on a pace, Which doth ensue: when Phœbe warme beames doth show His force from high, to dying things below. Then from his hole the seelie flye doth creepe, Spring the quickner againe of all. For ioy to feele the warmth approaching nye, Each creature else, whom winters wrath made weepe, But this spring, the comfort of all Christians, the haruest hath been long, God graunt many good laborers there in, that wh? Autum commeth, winter following be not sharpe. Reioyce cloudes past, beholding cleere the skye: Beastes caues, fruites earth, fowles naked bushes flie, Mounting towards ayre, and all doe seeme to sing, The sweetest time (of all) is in the spring. Which season chaunst when Cæsars burning sunne And haruest toyle, began to end, and drew both Autumne, and his winter course in one, Dispoyling him of all his prime gaynd hue, Octauius spring began the world anew: So fresh a spring as neuer was before Vpon the earth, nor euer shall be more. Cæsar thus slaine, his glory laied downe low, His force that late did through the world flie, Planting with care and yet not knowing who shall enioy that they haue toyled for. Ambitious mindes doth point, and as t'were show, Their vading ioy, when they haue toucht the skie: Great is their fall, that seeke to climbe on hie, Restlesse their mindes, besides their bodies toyle, Consuming time, themselues with cares do spoyle. Octauius, who was Cæsars sisters sonne, (The birth of whom recounted is before) Such loue belike had of the souldiers wonne, Of Legions he did gather a great store, Reuengement of his Iu. Cæsarvncles death he bore Secret in mind, but seemde, as though that he Tooke armes to fight, against Marc Antonie. In fauour of the publique state and weale: Inconstancie the change of many strange chances But ere t'was long, th'empire did diuide With him, and Lepidus, they three to deale In causes all, before them to be tried: Triumuirates so cald, for to decide Matters of warre, of peace, contention, strife, What euer els, concerned goods, or life. Marc Antonie at this time bare such sway, As by his power he gaue commandement, Marcus Tullius Cicero, for to slay, Who late in warres with power against him went: (This same was he that was so eloquent) But now behold how enuy sowed seede, Quarrels betweene the Triumuirates to breede: For Lepidus, deposde his office fro, Discention cause of distruction. Vpon suspition of some trecherie, Esteem'd Octauius for his mortall foe: Reuengde to be, drew to him Antonie, To Egypt-ward they both in hast did flie, Where Antonte tooke after vnto wife Cleopatra, which bred foule hate and strife. Liking and lust cause of dishonor Cupid (blind god) the Romanes heart did wound, At sight of this Egyptian (stately dame) Agreeing both, conuenient time was found, To quench desires heate, and burning flame: Strange may it seeme to some, the noble fame These two liu'd in, with honour, wealth at will, All pleasures sought, their minds for to fulfill. Fine sumptuous feastes, delights, with triumpes braue: What daintie thing was thought on, was not had: Gold, pearle, stone, attyre, that hart could craue, Nothing did want, that might their minds make glad, Sportes were deuisde, t'expell all causes sad, This life they led: but Antonie to blame For one part plaid, which wrought his end with shame. Octauius sister he had espousde before: Casting her off, th'egyptian tooke to wife, Which now at last grew to a canker sore, A cause that moued Cæsar vnto strife: When Antonie, amidst this pleasant life Sweet meat will haue sower sauce With his rich queene of Egypt wearing crowne: Dread set apart, fortune began to frowne. Cæsar his armie into Egypt lead: Egyptians force the Romanes made to flie, Hast and away, who fast did runne best sped, Cleopatra, and her braue Antonie, Their high estate brought downe by destinie: Force, and hope, faylde, their welfare to regaine, Excesse was turn'd, to penurie and paine. Recalling both their former liues to count, Now feeling want, reliefe to them was strange: No hope againe, vnto their state to mount, Despaire throughout their sences all did range, Working vile meanes, their wretched liues to change, With griefe of which, so nipped both their hartes, Delightes with carelesnes, bringes wrack and wretchednes. As loathing life, the same to death impartes. The Empire sole Octauius then did sway; Antonie dead, peace through the world was: Christes birth, the spring of our ioyes. Fortie foure yeares, he raigned day by day, And in the twentith nine, it came to passe That Iesu Christ, our onely Messias Was borne, (for vs) of a pure virgine, Our soules from hell, for to redeeme and winne. The Monarch now long resting without warre, Nation not any durst once striue gainst Romes state, By sea, or land, neere hand, or yet a farre. The first that did, were Germanes full of hate, People that time, louing strife and debate: But subiects Cæsar brought them vnder yoke, So fortunate he was, and bare such stroke. Some say that oft reuoluing in his minde, The burden great of gouernment he bare, Determind once, the same to haue assignde To others, to discharge him of that care: But priuate being, knew not how t'would fare, To leade that life might be vnto him strange, Doubting besides of Romes estate the change, Of noble minde, with vertues fully fraught The praise of Augustus. Constancie in virtue, maketh old age long happie. Peace to obserue, both liberall, bountie, free To learned men, who vertue, sought, and taught: For in his time, most higest in degree And perfect fine, (it's written for to bee) The Latin tongue, but now corrupt, vnpure To that was then, which we haue now in vre. When as the terme of fortie foure yeares Expired was, Cæsar at vtmost date Of life, did leaue (as by record appeares) In quiet peace his high Imperiall state, A thing (no doubt) ordainde before by fate So for to be, for good of all mankinde, As learned clarkes in holy writ doe finde. CAP. 15. The raigne of Tyberius next Emperour. Octauius dead, (whose name Augustus was) Next did succeed Tyberius to the state, His sonne adopt, and kinsman in like case: It's sayd the Senate humbly did him treate, (Vnwilling for to rule, his braines to beate,) To take the state on him, at last agreede: During whose raigne, there chaunst no worthy deede. Which was for profit of the publique wealth: But left vnto the Senate all the care, Seeing himselfe in rich estate, and health, Bent whole his minde to quiet life and fare, Occasion great th'empire did appaire: For now both Parthia, Denmarke, Poland, France, With other moe, against Rome did aduance. Thus may we see when as the floud is full, It falles againe: so fares all worldly haps, Fruites first be ripe, before men doe them pull: In seasons faire, sudden comes thunderclaps: In midst of ioyes, griefe all our mirth vpwraps: And now behold of Rome the morning shine, Past midday marke, begins for to decline. Christs death, our comfortable haruest, God grant vs grace to gather therby fruites, that in winter we dye not, but liue. Diuines doe hold, that in the fifteenth yeere Tyberius raignd, our Sauiour Iesu Christ Did suffer death, (to make vs sinners cleere, To dwell with him that sits in throne most highest, Who helpes vs aye, when dangers we be nighest) Whose Empire stands, and euer shall endure, When worlds pompe still fleeteth, neuer sure. CAP. 16. The raigne of Caligula. Caligula. Tyberius sonne, Caligula so calde Succeeded next, a most pernicious childe, Vnto all vice he was a bondslaue thralde, Most fit to dwell with sauage men and wilde, A life he led, that wicked was and vilde: Great heapes of gold, Tyberius in his raigne Had got, he spent in one yeare, lewd and vaine. Claudius. The Brytaines reuolt from Rome gouernement. Cl audius next him supposde his vncle, he Came to England, reduc'd againe that land That did reuolt, from Romanes soueraigntie, The Britaines did resist him with strong hand: But be orecame them with his Romane band, Gloucester, fo Cloudius Cæar. And ere from thence did part, (vnto his fame) A citie built, and calde it by his name. Nero. Next him ensued Nero, when once againe Virtue buildeth, vice plucketh downe The Britons bold began to warre anew: The Romanes they did pill, and put to paine: In France the Frenchmen also them orethrew: A mightie wind in many countries blew, In Syria, and also Armenia, Their forces most, were beat and shronk away. Last out of Spayne old Galba did retire, Drawne on by Who was gouernor of a prouince in France, for the Romanes wrote letters into Spayne. The onely decaye of the Empire was ciuill discord. Iulius Vindex, who from France Perswaded him to Cæsars seate aspire, (See how Ambition mortall minds doe launce) He was content, though old, (to follow chaunce) Did march to Rome, vpon whose comming fled Nero, who was most wretchedly found dead. Whose storie full at large may well be seene, In Tacitus in English fine translate, A worthie present for a King, or Queene, For noble Peeres, or others of high state: Virtues praise neuer dyeth. His praise deseru'd, shall neuer come too late, Who did so well, in English it reduce For high degree, to serue for publique vse. Where is describ'd Nero his monstrous life: A common-wealth, and state, in pieces torne: Whose increase is mightie now a dayes. Where may be seene, what fruites doe come of strife, How broods of vice, each quiet state doth scorne, And seeke to ruine: but subiects truly borne Flye ciuill discord, bringing woes and spoyles: Most foule are fowles their owne nests that befiles.
