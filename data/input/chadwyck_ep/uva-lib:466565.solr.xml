      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. PARIS IN 1815. A POEM, IN TWO PARTS. PART I. “Nulla quies intus. . . . . Nec tamen est clamor, sed parvæ murmura vocis. Atria turba tenet, veniunt leve vulgus, euntque, E quibus hi vacuas implent sermonibus auras, Hi narrata ferunt alio, mensuraque ficti Crescit, et auditis aliquid novus adjicit auctor.” OVID. METAM. XII. “I had a thing to say.—But let it go: The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day, Attended with the pleasures of the world, Is all too wanton, and too full of gauds, To give me audience:—If the midnight bell Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth, Sound one unto the drowsy race of night; Or if that thou could'st see me without eyes, Hear me without thine ears, and make reply Without a tongue, using conceit alone, Without ears, eyes, or harmful sound of words; Then, in despite of brooded, watchful day, I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts.” KING JOHN. I. Welcome, thou glorious dawn! Oh! who would cling To sleep, and sleep's bewildered fantasies; When he might see the rushing of thy wing, Spreading like clouds from some high sacrifice; And hear thy trumpet bid the world arise. While the wan morn-star, in her watch-tower gray, Extinguishes her little lamp and flies. But lo! the east is all one golden ray, And on his burning wheels out rolls the king of day II. Lovely—but lovelier still, when that bright morn Unfolds the vision of some first-seen land; And, as the twilight clouds are upwards borne, Foreign the hills, the vales, the streams expand; Charming the wanderer's foot suspense to stand, As, like a young creation, round him rise Its thousand shapes of soft, and bright, and grand; All strange, all spell-touch'd; ev'n the wild wind's sighs, The peasant's call, to him, romantic melodies! III. Yet who can feel it like the luckless wight, In France's lumbering wains through midnight pent, With heavy lids that will not slumber quite, Stiff limbs and beating brow, and spirit spent; When on the eastern hill's slow-gain'd ascent, The breeze first meets him from its bowers below, Streaming cool odours, living element; And his clear'd eye sees mount and forest glow; And the whole landscape lights its whole enchanted show. IV. 'Tis dawn upon Mont Martre! O'er the plain, In flake and spire, the sunbeam plunges deep, Bringing out shape, and shade, and summer-stain; Like a retiring host the blue mists sweep. Looms on the farthest right Valerien's steep, Crown'd with its convent kindling in the day; And swiftly sparkling from their bowery sleep, Like matin stars, around the horizon play Far village vanes, and domes and castle-turrets gray. V. 'Tis a rich scene; and yet the richest charm That e'er cloth'd earth in beauty, lives not here. Winds no green fence around the cultured farm; No blossom'd hawthorn shields the cottage dear. The land is bright, and yet to thine how drear, Unrivall'd England!—Well the thought may pine For those sweet fields where each, a little sphere, In shaded, sacred fruitfulness doth shine, And the heart higher beats that says, “This spot is mine.” VI. St. Cloud! How stately from the green hill's side Shoots up thy Parian pile! His transient hold, Who wore the iron crown of regicide! He treads its halls no more—his hour is told. The circle widens; Sevres bright and cold Peeps out in vestal beauty from her throne, Spared for Minerva's sake, when round her roll'd From yon high brow the Invader's fiery zone, Resistless, as can tell thy faded tow'rs, Meudon! VII. A trumpet!—at the sound Mont Martre's spread With martial crowds, a glittering, crimson tide, Pouring incessant from its sunbright head. Part, that in splendour deepen down its side, In square, and line, and column wheeling wide To many a solemn touch of harmony. Part to the far champaign that clanging ride, Like eagles darting from their aëry high, Like the rich-flashing lights of autumn's evening sky. VIII. The British bands! A power is in the sound, It speaks of freedom, valour, virtue nigh; It calls up England upon foreign ground! Far be from us the false philosophy That owns not country's nobly-partial tie! The thoughts that like a second nature come In distance and in death to fix the eye On the heart's classic soil;—by temple, tomb, By all love's names endear'd,—by all in one, our Home. IX. War has its mighty moments:—Heart of Man! Have all thy pulses vigour for a thrill Prouder than through those gallant bosoms ran When first their standards waved above that hill? When first they strove their downward gaze to fill With the full grandeur of their glorious prize— Paris! the name that from their cradle still Stung them in dreams; now, glittering in their eyes, Now won—won by the Victory of Victories! X. For this had bled their battle round the world; For this they round the world had come to war; Some with the shatter'd ensign that unfurl'd Its lion-emblems to the Orient star; And some, the blue Atlantic stemming far; And some, a matchless band, from swarthy Spain— With well-worn steel, and breasts of many a scar; And all their plains to their last conquering plain Were sport, their trophies all to this proud trophy vain. XI. Lovely the stranger's land—the tawny meads, Track'd by the sleepy Seine's meanders blue; The vintage ripening on its sloping beds, Like sheets of emeralds, dropping purple dew; The forest belting with its waste of yew The chateau, lonely as the exile's tomb Where rests its lord; the hill's exotic hue; The umbraged roads, that from th'horizon come, Like arrows, to one point, where still broods morning's gloom. XII. There sleep'st thou, Paris! What profounder sleep Were thine, had matchless hearts not sieged thee round! When those who sow'd in blood, in blood should reap, When the bold hunters from earth's farthest bound At length the tiger in his cavern found; Then, not yon cloud that wraps thy giddy dream, But the red vapour of the bloody ground, Such as o'er Moscow hung, had caught the gleam; The midnight fires of death, thy last, wild, waking beam. XIII. The gale has come,—at once the fleecy haze Floats up,—then stands a purple canopy, Shading th'imperial city from the blaze. Glorious the vision! tower and temple lie Beneath the morn, like waves of ivory, With many an azure streak and gush of green, As grove and garden on the dazzled eye Rise in successive beauty, and between Flows into sudden light the long, slow, serpent Seine. XIV. For Paris now.—Now farewell hill and vale, And silence sweet, fresh blooms, and dewy sky! Farewell the gentle moral of the gale, The wisdom written in the rose's dye! I go to meet the wizard city's eye, That puts on splendour but to dim the soul. A thousand years of crime beneath me lie! One glance!—I stand as on a mighty mole, Around whose base not waves, but evil ages roll. XV. And ye enduring monuments that rise, In your calm grandeur, round this fortress-hill, Masses of solemn shade and orient dyes! Are ye not each, as in that sea an isle, Sheltering the few and statelier memories, while The feeble pass like foam upon the wave? I gaze not here on Greek or Gothic pile!— I see but emblems of the days that gave An impulse to the world, to empires throne or grave. XVI. 'Twas a dark time, that on Valerien's brow Rear'd the sad refuge of that convent tower! There mind was buried, wither'd beauty's glow, There passion lost its hope, but not its power; Yet good was mix'd with ill; its midnight hour Heard prayers from haughty lips that then first pray'd; And woman who had wept her loveliest dower, There hid her broken heart in calm and shade, And turned her to His fold, who sought the lamb that stray'd! XVII. Earth had a burst of madness; come, and gone, Like lightning from its cloud—a withering blaze. There stand its lonely halls, its Pantheon; Then were those halls not lonely;—nights and days Roll'd o'er their thousands, pouring heaven's high praise, From more than pagan lips, to harlotry. Temple of many gods! while One delays For wisdom deeply veil'd from human eye, To strike it into dust, till ev'n its memory die. XVIII. The emblem-circle's wound. The sunbeams flow Latest, yet loveliest, on St. Denis' wall. But is there not a brighter sun than now Vestures in gold that patriarch cathedral? Is not earth's veil at length about to fall, As the slow shadows from that temple hoar; And the true faith unfold her gates to all; And man be glorious as he was before; And earth be Paradise, till time shall be no more? XIX. The hour shall come!—It is no mystic's trance, But true as He, who wills, and it is done! The hour shall come,—is come!—Our feeble glance Ev'n now sees stooping from its clouds the throne Where One shall rule o'er earth—The Mighty One. Its kings his hallow'd viceroys—man's old stain Fast brightening from the spirit;—war unknown;— Till Death has died! and, rushing from his chain, To heaven th'immortals rise, with angel plume and strain. XX. Now, from the Mount!—Through solid dust we sweep, Chok'd, crushing, struggling to wile back our sleep. The barrier's reach'd—out rolls the drowsy guard; A scowl—a question—and the gate's unbarr'd. And this is Paris! The postillion's thong Rings round a desert, as we bound along, Onward, still darker, doubly desolate, Winds o'er the shrinking head the dangerous strait. The light is lost; in vain we peer our way Through the rank dimness of the Fauxbourg day; In vain the wearied eyeball strains to scale That squalid height, half hovel and half jail: At every step the struggling vision bar Projections sudden, black, and angular, Streak'd with what once was gore, deep rent with shot, Marks of some conflict furious and—forgot! At every step, from sewer and alley sail The crossing steams that make the senses quail, Defying breeze's breath and summer's glow, Charter'd to hold eternal mire below. Grim loneliness!—and yet some blasted form Will start upon the sight, a human worm, Clung to the chapel's wall—the lank throat bare, The glance shot woeful from the tangled hair, The fleshless, outstretch'd arm, and ghastly cry, Half forcing, half repelling charity. Or, from the portal of the old hotel, Gleams on his post the victor-centinel, Briton or German, shooting round his ken, From its dark depth, a lion from his den. Tis light and air again: and lo! the Seine, The Frenchman's boast, yon lazy, livid drain! With bridges, shaking to the foot, o'erlaid, Booths for its barges, painted trees its shade. Yet here are living beings, and the soil Breeds its old growth of ribaldry and broil. A whirl of mire, the dingy cabriolet Makes the quick transit through the crowded way; On spurs the courier, creaks the crazy wain, Dragg'd through its central mud by might and main, Around our way-laid wheels the paupers crowd, With every vileness of man's nature bow'd. The whole a mass of folly, woe, and strife, Of heated, rank, corrupting, reptile life: And, endless as their ouzy tide, the throng Roll on with endless clamour, curse, and song. Fit for such tenants, low'r on either side The hovels where the gang less live than hide; Story on story, savage stone on stone, Time-shatter'd, tempest-stain'd, less built than thrown. Sole empress of the portal, in full blow, The rouged grisette lays out her trade below, Ev'n in her rags a thing of wit and wile, Eye, hand, lip, tongue, all point, and press, and smile. Close by, in patch and print, the pedlar's stall Flutters its looser glories up the wall. Spot of corruption! where the rabble rude Loiter round tinsel tomes, and figures nude; Voltaire, and Laïs, long alternate eyed, Till both the leper's soul and sous divide. Above, 'tis desert, save where sight is scar'd With the wild visage through the casement barr'd. But, venture on the darkness; and within See the stern haunt of wretchedness and sin. The door unhinged, for winter's bitterest air, The paper pane, the gapp'd and shaking stair, Winding in murkiness, as to the sty Of guilt forlorn, or base debauchery; The chamber, tatter'd, melancholy, old, Yet large—where plunder might its midnights hold; And in its foulest corner, from the day Sullen and shrunk, its lord, the Federé. Meagre the form, the visage swart and spare, Furrow'd with early vice and desperate care; Hollow the cheek, the eye ferocious guile, Yet gentle to his hard, habitual smile. His end on earth, to live the doubtful day, And glean the livre for the Sunday's play. Heavy that chamber's air; the sunbeams fall Scatter'd and sickly on the naked wall; Through the time-crusted casement scarcely shown The rafter'd roof, the floor of chilling stone, The crazy bed, the mirror that betrays Frameless, where vanity yet loves to gaze; And still, the symbols of his darker trade, The musquet, robber-pistol, sabre blade, Hung rusting, where around the scanty fire His squalid offspring watch its brands expire. His glance is there;—another, statelier spot Has full possession of his fever'd thought; In the fierce past the fierce to-come he sees, The day return'd of plunder'd palaces, When faction revell'd, mobs kept thrones in awe, And the red pike at once was king and law. XXI. Yet, contrast strange! beside that dismal cell Tow'rs on the eye the Seigneur's proud hotel. Repelling too, no waste of outward state Here told th'exclusive pleasures of the great; Yet, in those bounds, the cup of luxury Was brimm'd as rich as e'er made midnight fly. Beauty and pomp were in its festal hall, Gay valour, courtly wit, youth, passion, all. Sight of enchantment,—down its vista's blaze Of gold and jewel-vestured forms to gaze! One buoyant, brilliant dance of tress and plume Gleaming o'er eyes of light, and cheeks of bloom. Nor lovely less, to turn, where through the shade Faint from the glow, the groupes of beauty stray'd; The suite of silent, stately chambers past, In each the distant radiance feebler cast; In each the concert's sweetness softer sent; Till on the burning cheek, new element, New life was breathed in night's delicious air, Streaming from violet bank and rose parterre. Heart-swelling hour! On her profoundest sky In glory throned, the moon's lone majesty; From that huge, slumbering city sent no sound; Above, all brightness; soul-felt silence, round! Save where, as sudden opes the distant hall, Faint as its light, the tones in sweetness fall, A breath of harp and flute, a silver sigh, A wild, swift touch, of fairy harmony; Save where the fountain murmuring in its shell With the far concert's murmurs mixeth well. But pass the porch, and all was past:—the wall, Long, blank, surmounted by the turret tall; The loophole, massive buttress, thund'ring gate That shuts upon the world the court of state; The casement dim, with bar and bolt secured, The sculptured shield, the high roof embrazured, Strike to the stranger's eye the sudden thrill, And give the felon and his dungeon still. XXII. But pause! what pile athwart the crowded way Frowns with such sterner aspect? The Abbaye! Is it not curst? has not the smell of blood Struck it for ever into solitude? No! To the past as to the future cold, Self and the moment all his heart can hold, The deep damnation of the deed forgot Before the blood was stiffen'd on the spot; Gay in the sight, the shadow of the pile, The meagre native plays his gambol vile; The crack'd horn rings, the rival mimes engage, Punch in imperial tatters sweeps the stage; The jostling mob dance, laugh, sing, shout the rhyme, And die in ecstacies the thousandth time. And look! around, above, what ghastly row Through bar and grating struggle for the show, Down darting, head o'er head, the haggard eye, Felons! the scarcely scaped,—the sure to die! The dungeon'd murderer startles from his trance, Uplist'ning hears the din, the monkey-dance, Growls at the fate that fix'd his cell below, And longs, before he dies,—to see the show! Yes, 'twas the spot!—where yonder slow gendarme Sweeps from his round the loitering pauper-swarm; Where up the mould'ring wall that starveling vine Drags on from nail to nail its yellow twine; For ornament! Still something for the eye; Prisons, nay graves, have here their foppery:— There, primed for blood, Danton drew up his band, The Marseillois, the Fauxbourg's black brigand. The gate roll'd back,—as out to liberty “Elargissez, Monsieur!” was the signal for assassination by the mob in the massacres of September, 1792. One bounding came,—the murderers met his eye, He heard their laugh,—he dropp'd in desperate prayer For life—for life!—His brain was spattered there;— Another came—recoil'd—gave one wild wail, And sank in gore,—the bullet stopp'd his tale. The work went hotly on. Dark place of crime! What hideous guilt, what suffering sublime Were in thee,—emblem of the ruin'd land! Frequent, amid the shoutings of the band, Rose from within prayer, laughter!—Pass that wall A crowd were gather'd in a lofty hall, An ancient chapel, lingering each till came The harrowing, certain summons of his name. A man stood in its pulpit; one strong ray That through the grating struggled down its way, Fell on his upturn'd brow, and tonsure bare. His hands were clasp'd, he prayed with mighty pray'r,— Then bent him where the failing light below Just glanced on shapes and visages of woe. And there were those who felt, yet scorn'd to feel, And smiled in ghastliness to see his zeal, And knowing they had reach'd their dying day, Resolv'd to think no more, and turn'd away!— And those, who weary of the cell and chain, Saw the last day of life the last of pain, And, sadly flung upon the chilling floor, Listen'd lethargic to the outward roar— But there were those, who on him fix'd the eye, In the deep gaze of utter agony; Kneeling without a heave, without a groan,— As if that hour had struck them into stone. The shouts had died,—'twas silence,—sudden rang A shriek throughout the prison!—All upsprang;— Each fixing on his fellow wretch the eye, In the broad glare of desperate sympathy; Another miserable hour, and they Who shudder'd there might be—but gore and clay! The preacher bow'd his head; his hands were prest A moment with his Bible on his breast;— His voice a moment stopp'd:—the pang was past, 'Twas nature's terror, painful,—but her last. His voice awoke; his spirit in him burn'd; All eyes instinctive on the martyr turn'd. He told them of the things that man's dull ear, Fill'd with life's flatteries, so hates to hear; He told them of the Christian's cross and crown, And raised his hands to bless them;—all sank down,— All humbly bow'd their heads to earth, all felt At his ascending prayer their bosoms melt; All trembled,—and strange thoughts upon them stole, That look'd like heavenly dawnings in the soul; And tears began down wither'd cheeks to flow, Nor tears of joy, but far too soft for woe! They rose;—and they who knelt upon that floor, Were naked spirits ere that day was o'er. Behind that chapel's altar oped a room— Gloomy—the deeds done there were fit for gloom. A torch, that languish'd in the heavy air, Feebly made up the daylight's sullen glare; It shew'd a table, soil'd with wine, and strew'd With plunder in still deeper stains embrued; Around it on the platform benches lay Dark, muffled shapes that slept their drench away. A few, in whom the past debauchery Was squalid still, hung loose and lowering by, And judged!—For this was a tribunal;—these, Judges!—The basest rabble's basest lees, These slaves of vulgar folly, guilt, and rage, These mountebanks upon a bloody stage; Wretches! whose aspects told of hell begun; Their joyless joy, to see mankind undone! And they were speedy too; no ancient saws Check'd the bold current of the rabble's laws; A glance—a taunt upon the victim cast, A sign,—he pass'd away—to slaughter pass'd. And now, a prisoner stood before them, wan With dungeon damps and woe—an ancient man, But stately;—there was in his hoary hair A reverend grace that Murder's self might spare. Two of the mob, half naked, freshly dyed In crimson clots, waved sabres at his side. He told his tale,—a brief, plain, prison tale,— Well vouch'd by those faint limbs and features pale: His words were strong, the manly energy Of one not unprepared to live or die. His judges wavered, whispered, seemed to feel Some human touches at his firm appeal.— He named his king!—a burst of scoff and sneer Pour'd down, that even the slumberers sprang to hear; Startled, to every grating round the room Sprang visages already seal'd for doom; Red from their work without, in rush'd a crowd, Like wolves that heard the wonted cry of blood. He gazed above,—the torch's downward flame Flash'd o'er his cheek;—'twas red,—it might be shame, Shame for his country, sorrow for her throne;— 'Twas pale,—the hectic of the heart was gone. His guards were flung aside;—he tore his vest, A ribbon'd cross was on his knightly breast,— It covered scars;—he deigned no more reply; None, but the scorn that lighten'd from his eye. His huddled, hurried judges dropp'd their gaze; The villain soul's involuntary praise! He kiss'd his cross, and turn'd him to the door An instant,—and they heard his murderers' roar! 'Twas shapeless carnage now; in meek despair, Gazing on heaven, the pastor died in prayer; The soldier met the sabre's whirl unmoved; The matron perish'd on the corse she loved; Yet there were dying bursts; with rush and reel, Some 'mid the assassin ranks made desperate wheel, Down-stricken, rising, bleeding, tottering round, Till the ball stretch'd the struggler on the ground; Others, the red knee clasping, sank and wept; Alike o'er faint and bold the havoc swept. The evening fell,—in bloody mists the sun Rush'd glaring down; nor yet the work was done. 'Twas night; and still upon the Bandit's eye Came from their cavern those who came to die; A long, weak, wavering, melancholy wave, As from the grave, returning to the grave. 'Twas midnight;—still the gusty torches blazed On shapes of woe, dim gestures, faces glazed; And still, as through the dusk the ghastly file Moved onward, it was added to the pile! Ruler of Heaven! did not the righteous groan Rise from this spot in vengeance to thy throne! Or did the torrent that so redly ran Round those heaped remnants of what once was man, That mass of cloven bone, and shatter'd limb, And spouting brain, and visage strain'd and dim, And horrid life still quivering in the eye, As, choked in blood, the victim toil'd to die— Did it sink voiceless in the thirsty ground?— No! from that hour the iron band was bound, No! from that hour was fixed the mighty seal To the long woes that France was doomed to feel; Plague, famine, in God's sterner wrath untried— Her deeper sentence, man, the homicide! 1 Chronicles, chap. 21. verse 13. XXIII. Perish the vision!—no,—on France's eye Still let it hang,—as o'er a murderer's His victim's shade,—in noon, in midnight nigh, Till she has laid it in repentant tears; Till man has seen what fruit rebellion bears; The noblest sure to perish by the low, Stripp'd by their rapine, slaughter'd by their fears; Guilt's tender mercies, that uplift the blow, While from its pallid lips “faith, honor, country” flow. XXIV. But musing's done.—The rabble round me press, With every cry of earth since Babel's fall. The world's in gala,—Poissarde loveliness Glides, faint and feather'd from her last night's ball, Dispensing glances on the friseur small, The tiptoe thing beside her,—all bouquet; His bowing head, a curly carnival; His shoulders to his earrings, grimly gay;— All have put on their smiles; 'tis the King's holiday. XXV. A cannon roars,—a rocket cleaves the air In rushing beauty, waving up its way, Like a red snake. With backward step and stare The crowd pursue its burst,—'tis lost in day. White banners on the palace turrets play; And soon, like sheets of newly waken'd flame, They rise from many a roof and steeple gray, Thick meteors, ray'd with cross and patron name; While in rich thunders roll the peals of Notre Dâme. XXVI. Below, the streets are changing; tissues trim From door to door, from house to house are swung; Deep with devices, shatter'd oft and dim, For fortune's turns in loyal darkness flung. The wheel has turn'd; the world again is young. The mob, the troops that down the distance stand Lingering and loose, are with the lily strung; The poissarde beauties whirling hand in hand, Fling up the exiled flower with shouts;—such is the land! XXVII. A distant trumpet sounds; the river shore Sends it in echoes on; the soldiers haste To loose their piles of muskets;—standards soar, Drums rattle,—voices clamour,—bugles blast; The mob confused from side to side are cast; Horsemen dash by with spur and slacken'd rein. Moment of tumult! quickly come and past. To bridge and wall the crowd like billows drain, And all their myriad eyes are fix'd along the Seine. XXVIII. The flourish swells again. The Louvre arch Pours out an instant flood of sight and sound. Dense as a wall the steel'd cuirassiers march, With clash, and clang, and chargers' mettled bound, And leaders' cries, as squadron'd, wheeling round Successive from the porte, they meet the glare, Blazed back from helm and mail. Yet all are drown'd In the proud, sudden shout that rends the air, As on his barb reins out the royal mousquetaire. XXIX. They come, as brilliant and as gay a train, As in the brightest noon of chivalry Poised the light lance, or wound the broidered rein, To win the glance of royal beauty's eye. And every emblem rich and lovely dye, And blazonry of gold and costly stone, Flashes, from knightly spur to helmet high, Around the youthful champions of the throne, They had their hour of woe, their triumph is well won. XXX. It was a dreary time; that deep midnight, Which saw those warriors to their chargers spring, And, sadly gathering by the torch's light, Draw up their squadrons round their ruin'd king: Then, through the streets, long, silent, slumbering, Move like some secret noble funeral: Each forced in turn to feel his bosom wring, As in the gleam shone out his own proud hall, His own no more;—no more!—he had abandon'd all! XXXI. And when, through many a league of chase and toil, With panting steed, red spur, and sheathless sword, At last they reach'd the stranger's sheltering soil; They saw their country, where they saw its lord. Proudly they fenced the Bourbons' couch and board;— Better the exile's dungeon, or his tomb, Than the base triumphs of the rebel's sword. They saw the lightning gathering through the gloom; They knew the wrath would come,—and sternly did it come. XXXII. I love not war, too oft the mere, mad game That tyrants play to keep themselves awake. But 'tis not war—it earns a nobler name— When men gird on the sword for conscience' sake, When country, king, faith, freedom are the stake. There is a power in man that passeth show. England, if e'er ambition think to shake The holy diadem from thy freeborn brow, Up, in the name of Heaven! and strike the freeman's blow. XXXIII. Yet they were happier in that foreign soil, The exile's home, perhaps to be his grave;— Than those who came to revel in their spoil. The feast was over in the bandit's cave, The first, hot, wild excess had ceased to rave;— And now 'twas hush'd debate and jealous fear; The ruffian's hand the ruffian's heart misgave; And crowded close, with sword half drawn, quick ear, They seem'd the thunder-peal, the avenging hosts, to hear. XXXIV. Aye; 'twere a lesson worth an age of man, To look upon that council chill and late— The grand Impostor, now with conscience wan, Waiting his own, who fix'd an empire's fate; Sunk to the dust; for terror knows not state. Round him of glaring visages a cloud, Like naked passions, shame, ire, horror, hate; Each taunting each, all on their tempter loud, All seeing in their steps the scaffold and the shroud. XXXV. The pomp has deepen'd. Thro' the Louvre-arch Swells out the horse and foot's unwearied tide; A sheet of steel the close-lock'd column's march, Waving, as plants the mass its solid stride; A following cloud, the squadron's plume of pride Floating above.—But soon and statelier bound A troop, to whom, as down the lines they ride, The deep drums roll, the standards stoop profound, The upturn'd trumpets give the rich, saluting sound. XXXVI. France is herself again;—bridge, roof, and wall, Are lined with faces struggling for the show. The pageant comes;—uncapp'd and hush'd are all; It comes, with many a pause, expanding slow In splendour, like the summer's showery bow; A press of horse and herald, lance and vane; And pages piled in gold and scarlet-glow On chariot roofs; and barbs with ribbon'd mane; And chieftains spurring round, with star, and staff, and chain. XXXVII. Marshal and duke, in flank, and front, and rear, An inner cohort, guard the Sovereign, And that fair, jewell'd form—his daughter dear, The royal Angoulême; and where the train Halt for the moment, bursts the shout again, And swell the trumpets lifted to the sky. They move,—and still arise the shout and strain, And all along their march is ear and eye, Till in the Abbey's porch the last deep concords die. XXXVIII. The pile is full; and oh, what splendours there Rush, in thick tumult, on the entering eye! The Gothic shapes, fantastic, yet austere; The altar's crown of seraph imagery; Champion and king that on their tombstones lie, Now cluster'd deep with beauty's living bloom; And glanced from shadowy stall and alcove high, Like new-born light, through that mysterious gloom, The gleam of warrior steel, the toss of warrior plume. XXXIX. The organ peals; at once, as some vast wave, Bend to the earth the mighty multitude, Silent as those pale emblems of the grave In monumental marble round them strew'd. Low at the altar, forms in cope and hood Superb with gold-wrought cross and diamond twine, Life in their upturn'd visages subdued, Toss their untiring censers round the shrine, There on her throne of clouds the Virgin sits divine. XL. But, only kindred faith can fitly tell Of the high ritual at that altar done, When clash'd the arms and rose the chorus-swell, Then sank,—as if beneath the grave 'twere gone; Till broke the spell the mitred abbot's tone, Deep, touching, solemn, as he stood in prayer, A dazzling form upon its topmost stone, And raised, with hallowed look, the Host in air, And bless'd with heavenward hand the thousands kneeling there. XLI. Pompous!—but love I not such pomp of prayer; Ill bends the heart 'mid mortal luxury. Rather let me the meek devotion share, Where, in their silent glens and thickets high, England, thy lone and lowly chapels lie. The spotless table by the eastern wall, The marble, rudely traced with names gone by, The pale-eyed pastor's simple, fervent call; Those deeper wake the heart, where heart is all in all. XLII. Vain the world's grandeur to that hallow'd roof Where sate our fathers many a gentle year; All round us memory; at our feet the proof, How deep the grave holds all we treasure here: Nay, where we bend, still trembling on our ear The voice whose parting rent life's loveliest ties; And who demands us all, heart, thought, tear, prayer? Ev'n He who saith “Mercy, not sacrifice,” Cares He for mortal pomp, whose footstool is the skies! XLIII. If pride be evil;—if the holiest sighs Must come from humblest hearts, if man must turn Full on his wreck of nature, to be wise;— If there be blessedness for those who mourn;— What speak the purple gauds that round us burn? Ask of that kneeling crowd whose glances stray So restless round on altar, vestment, urn; Can guilt weep there? can mild repentance pray? Ask, when this moment's past, how runs their sabbath day! XLIV. Their sabbath day! Alas! to France that day Comes not; she has a day of looser dress, A day of thicker crowded ball and play, A day of folly's hotter, ranker press; She knoweth not its hallowed happiness, Its eve of gather'd hearts and gentle cheer. Paris! how many an outcast might confess Her first temptation in its guilty glare! What saith yon sullen Morgue?—go, seek the victim there. XLV. 'Tis open!—Never fails its sight of woe! And crowds are rushing to that fearful dome, And crowds are scattering out, subdued and slow; They've seen,—to what complexion life may come. 'Tis narrow as the grave, a house of gloom: And on the wall, with ouze and blood long dyed, Are hung a spangled robe, a broken plume, Dropping, as fresh-drawn from the river tide, And cold beneath them lies—the lost!—the suicide! XLVI. A few rude boards are now her beauty's bed; Her still and roseless cheek has now no veil But one long, dripping lock across it shed; Yet her wide eye looks living. Oh! the tale Told there—of reason that began to fail, Of wild remorse, of the last agony, When wandering, desperate, in the midnight gale, She flung to sightless heaven her parting cry, Then in the dark wave plunged, to struggle and to die. XLVII. The crowd pass on. The hurried, trembling look, That dreaded to have seen some dear one there, Soon glanced, they silent pass. But in yon nook, Who kneels, deep shrinking from the oriel's glare, Her forehead veil'd, her lip in quivering prayer, Her raised hands with the unfelt rosary wound? That shrouded,—silent—statue of despair Is she who through the world's delusive round Had sought her erring child, and found, and there had found! XLVIII. Fair Angoulême! in what empurpled bower Pass'd thy young innocence the sunny hour?— Her sun was dim. The prison was the clime That struck upon the royal infant's prime. Her joys, to watch the sentinel's dull round, Till her ear sicken'd at the weary sound; To count, yet care not for the hour's slow wheel, As one on whom the grave had set its seal; To pine upon her pillow for the day, Yet, seen, to wish its cheerless beam away; Then, tremble as drew on the tedious night, And feel as life were parting with the light;— Then—to her couch, to weep and watch for morn, To shew her she was living—and forlorn! She had companions. Deeper misery! All whom she loved on earth were there—to die! And they must perish from her—one by one— And her soul bleed with each, till all were gone. This is the woe of woes, the sting of fate, To see our little world grow desolate, The few on whom the very soul reclined Sink from the eye, and feel we stay behind;— Life, to the farthest glance, a desert road, Dark, fearful, weary—yet that must be trod. Daughter of France! did not such pangs compress Thy heart in its last, utter loneliness? Didst thou not droop thy head upon thy hand, Then, starting, think that time was at a stand, And find its flight but by the thicker gloom That dimm'd thy solitary dungeon room? Didst thou not gaze upon thy glimpse of sky, And long to bid the last, best hour be nigh? Or melted even by that moment's view, Stoop to the world again, and think, how blue, How bright to thousands spread its canopy; How many a joyous heart and laughing eye, Buoyant with life and hope, and free,—oh, free!— Bask'd in the brightness thou shouldst never see? Her world was past; her hours, or few or more, Left her bound, wretched—all she was before! This, this is misery—the headsman's steel Strikes, and we perish—but we cease to feel. XLIX. The Temple tower is fallen; yet still the grot Lives in pale mockery of the woeful spot; The weedy walk still borders the parterre, A few wild shrubs still drink the heavy air; And, help'd by some rude tracery on the green, The eye may image where the pile has been: But all is past,—trench, buttress, bustling guard,— For silence, ruin, and the pale, dead sward. Heaven! what wild weight of suffering was prest In this close den, this grave in all but rest! What hope, fear, agony the high hearts thrill'd, That mercy, though 'twas blood, so quickly still'd; And what high hearts that fiery circle ran, And what fiends urged them, in the shape of man! I trod the ground with reverence, for that ground Was holy to my tread; its dungeon-bound, Dear as the spot where blood and ashes tell That there the martyr closed his triumph well; The torture's tools ev'n hallow'd—brand and stake, Scourge, fetter—all, all relics for his sake. Ev'n on that weedy path had moved the train Who never move to human eyes again. Sad Antoinette! Alas! her morning star Was set, and all its worshippers were far. She had no sphere to lighten now; that wall Enclosed her palace, kingdom, world—her all! Yet, to the last, her glance was majesty, Or dimm'd but when it met her partner's eye;— And learn'd its patience of the eye that met The chain, the dungeon, death, as nature's debt; No murmur on the monarch's lip, in heaven The heart, the world forgotten and forgiven. And there their infants clung, subdued and nigh; There follow'd the meek sister, fix'd to die. It was a walk of woe. By spy and guard The converse of the pining heart debarr'd; Forced to hear taunts that shock'd the purer ear, And while they wrung their souls, not seem to hear; Longing to lay down life, yet driven to win, For their unconscious babes, the men of sin;— Till the bell toll'd, and some grim centinel Block'd up their path, and turn'd them to their cell. Yet hours were spent within that fearful pile, When the lip wore the sainted spirit's smile; When books, and such light toil as smooths away, If aught can smooth, the lingering prison day: And more, that holy unity of heart That smiled together, only wept apart; Peace, prayer, and heaven, their gentle hearts enwove, Dungeons themselves but ministers of love! Their days were number'd, and the grave's dark stone Soon chill'd their agonies;—one, orphan'd one! Left here to weep:—no!—left to wait the time Destined to give them the revenge sublime; Destined to bid their child, their heroine, bear A nation's sorrows to their sepulchre. L. 'Tis noon: the flags cling close on roof and spire, The sun burns broad, a ball of living fire; The sky is blue—celestial, summer-blue: Here rise no sulphurous smokes to shroud its hue; No clouds of pestilence, that mine and forge, To blot out heaven and poison earth, disgorge. Now comes the idler's hour. The beggar-bard Takes his old quarters on the gay Boulevard; Beneath the trees the Conjuror spreads his tools; The Quack harangues his group of graver fools In lofty lies, unruffled by the jar Thrumm'd from his neighbour Savoyard's guitar; Veil'd virgins beam, like Dian in a mist; Philosophers show mites; she-tumblers twist; Each the fix'd genius of some favourite tree, Dryads and fauns of Gallic minstrelsy. In double glories now, the broad Marchande, Fire-eyed, her skin by Gascon summers tann'd, Red as the kerchief round her coal-black hair, Lays out her tempting trays of rich and rare; Resistless ruby bands, delicious rings, In genuine paste; the true wax coral strings, Mingling with wonders of profounder art, Woman's dear helps to mystify the heart; Crisp auburn curls,—to hide th'obtrusive gray, That stubborn hue, which yet will make its way; Glass eyes, mouse eyebrows, teeth like studs of snow, Grinning in grim good humour row by row; Secrets so stiffly kept from upper air, Yet here let loose, the sex's whole repair. And here, in all the splendors of placard, Beauty's last polishers, the rouge and fard! Mysterious things! that, like the tricks of dreams, Make what is seem not, while what is not, seems; Deep witcheries! whose absence makes the fright, Raising their ghosts at morn, their nymphs at night— Soft potions! minister'd with softest skill,— Yet used with desperate intent—to kill; Obedient charms! that many a charming maid Summons long after all the rest are laid! The air grows furnace-hot; flag, awning, screen, Peep endless from those lovely lines of green; Yet Autumn has been there;—the russet tinge, Deep purples, pearly grays, the poplars fringe; And ever, in the distance some proud tower Looks out in feudal beauty from its bower. All a strange, mirthful, melancholy show; Stately decay above, wild life below! This is no city-scene. The tree, the tent, The small, bright flags that break the line's extent; The guns defiling down the central road, The escort round the halted convoy strow'd, The courier Cossack rushing in career With low bent head, slack rein, and levell'd spear, The clang within the lines, the measur'd tramp, The mime and minstrel sounds,—is this a camp? And this a hurrying army, that have made Their forest-halt till noon's high blaze is staid; To move with eve, to see the twilight's gray Float on their banners many a league away; At morn to spring to arms, at noon—be laid Silent and pale—nor care for sun or shade? It is a camp; a matchless host;—the breeze That lets in sunlight through the heaving trees, Flings into sudden splendour form and plume, Like visions, flashing bright, then lost in gloom;— Perpetual blaze of gem, and steel, and gold; Russ helm, Hungarian mantle's broider'd fold, Green Tartar-turban, Georgian orange shawl O'er silver mail; deep sables of Ural; Broad bosoms corsleted with cross and star; Dark, haughty faces bronzed with glorious war, Champions, that each a battle's strength has stood, Chief caterers of the vulture's fearful food; Now mingled,—mighty with one triumph more Greatest and last,—Earth's day of war is o'er! LI. A distant bell has toll'd,—the wanderers well Know in its heavy clang the palace bell; And each puts on his speed, and many a stride Has passed its courts before the sound has died. The gates stand closed; the Swiss, a thing of state, Poising his key as if the key of fate, Smiles, soothes, impartial deals his soft survey To the proud strugglers whom he keeps at bay; The answering smile, bribe, menace tried in vain, An entrance from his weaker man to gain. The signal comes at last. The portals all Are instant open, instant fill'd the hall; Winding, a long, bright column, up the stair, On press its plumaged host of brave and fair, With many a wondering glance, and voice of mirth. But France! thou guiltiest of the guilty earth, Why lives in all thy scenes of great or gay Something that makes the spirit turn away, Some traitorous taint, some odour of the vault, Scarce to be thought on, ne'er to be forgot? If man would worship murder, man might fall At murder's darkest shrine in that high hall. Broad day,—the nation gazing on the deed,— A righteous king unthroned—torn out—to bleed! His band in blood above, his gallant band, That stair their fort, their field, their last sad stand. Then roll'd the crowd—no press of holiday; 'Twas steel to steel, to musket musket's play; Then there were sparklings through the balustrade— 'Twas the sword shivering on the bayonet blade; Up to the roof was cloud,—a mass of night, The volley's livid burst the only light; Scarce known where man was gorging upon man, But by the clots that down its sculptures ran; Or the lopp'd head that by the gory hair High whirl'd, shot like a meteor down the stair; Or the torn wretch who, gash'd too deep to fly, Dragg'd to the porch his mangled limbs to die. The roar went on above. Vile, noble trunk On that red spot in thick communion sunk; The glorious dead, the guilty in one gore, They met in madness, and they part no more. Tis past, or past to those who now spread on Sportive, through chambers thick with couch and throne; Large, lofty, gorgeous, all that meets the eye Strong with the stamp of ancient majesty; The impress which so undefined, yet clear, Tells that the former Mighty have been there. All looking hoary pomp; the walls rich scroll'd, The roof high flourish'd, arras stiff with gold, In many a burning hue and broad festoon Wreathing those casements, blazon'd now with noon; The marble tablets on their silver claws, Loaded with nymph, and grace, and pix, and vase. Beside the mirror foot, the Indian screen Dazzling the eye with dragons red and green: The mighty mirror, brightning, doubling all, In its deep crystal lit an endless hall. The rout a moment paused, gave glance and smile, Then scatter'd on, to wonder through the pile; Yet there was beauty in the very light That round the chamber roll'd its gush of white, And well the wanderer there might feel his gaze Tranced by the bright creations of the blaze. It stoops, a pyramid of fire,—the floor Gleams like a shifting bed of molten ore; It strikes the antique mail, the mail returns A sanguine flame; the vase in jasper burns; The deep-nich'd statue in that lustre thrown Gleams, as if light were flashing from the stone; The altar curtain droops, a pale, proud fold; 'Tis touch'd—'tis living purple, imaged gold. A massive porte rolls back; the walls, thick starr'd With pike and pistol, tell the hall of guard. War all its emblems, from the gloomy roof Girt with its bold, black forms in knightly proof, Down to the floor, where by his bright stockade Paces the mousquetaire in slow parade. But man may be the sterner emblem still; Marshal and prince around the canvass fill; War's thunderbolts! their track was blood and flame, They blazed and sank—their country's boast and shame. The heart turns from them; like the desert blast, They rose to slay, they slew, and they are past. And treachery has been here. There hangs a pall For ever on the Marshals' pompous hall. LII. The crowd have scatter'd far,—a distant room Has check'd their laughter; swift and hush'd they come. What holds the wonderers now? A canopy, Topp'd with a mouldering plume, a golden bee Half from its curtain's faded crimson torn, A cypher deep defaced, a wreath forlorn,— They gaze but on a chair.—Yet lo! the throne Of conquest, crime, despair—Napoleon! This was Earth's heart! when here the sceptre strook, Through all her realms the keen vibration shook. The murmur here—swell'd forth an oracle, And nations heard it in its wrath, and fell. Here stamp'd the foot,—and bursting up like flame, The crown-givers, the eagle legions came. There was a darkness on it; woe to eye That dared to pierce the evil sanctuary! Prowess and pomp were there; the gloomy spear Waved in incessant circuit; prince and peer Bowing their haughty foreheads helm'd and crown'd, Hung like a fiery cloud the throne around. It had a mightier guard,—that cloud within, Sate Guilt that chill'd the heart, substantial Sin; And man had bled, and diadems been riven, Till terror saw it delegate of heaven. Wisdom was air, strength ashes, valour wan, Before the form, the man, if that were man! Is there not one—a being from his height Of glory fall'n, a shape of burning might, A ruin'd grandeur, angel beauty marr'd, On his trench'd brow the early crown unstarr'd; Condemn'd through earth on restless wing to range, His joy, his agony, revenge, revenge: And has he not the passing power to dart, Supernal vigour through the traitor's heart; Seduce the weak before him, bend the high, Till the world owns its evil Deity? The Tyrant's peace was fearful. Fatal guile Entomb'd the slaves who trusted to his smile. But when he scorn'd the mask, and shouted war, And here unroll'd the banner of the star; Who slumber'd then?—what land but fix'd its eye For omens on the eagle's augury? The ancient empires shook. The mighty North Sent her reluctant suppliants hurrying forth; The South gave up her gold. The Ottoman Cower'd to a haughtier sultan's dark divan. And he, the Master, sate beneath that plume, And kings stood here, nay trembling, in this room; His vassals,—wither'd in his evil blaze; And now—the meanest hind may scoff and gaze! The final vengeance came! but sent by whom? Was it in man to burst this den, this tomb! Lives there the human heart that dared to hope To stand in scorn beneath this charnel cope? 'Twas as if Heav'n would bare to human eyes Its empire o'er its own fierce agencies. As if the tempest-cloud had oped its gorge, To shew the secrets of the thunder's forge. As if some final shock had drunk the wave That rolls in gloom o'er ocean's central cave; Stripping to man its bosom, boundless vale Of wreck and buried wealth, and corpses pale; The world of storms and sepulchres subdued; All one wild waste—death, silence, solitude! Stranger and enemy are round that chair; But are no sterner shapes of friendship there? No haughty frowns, bold tauntings, bitter sighs, No pangs our nature knows not, till it dies? Gaze ye not here, who, freezing in your gore, Made the drear halt on Berezyna's shore; And heard the Tartar's shout, and rushing wave, Mark, through the dusk, the limits of your grave, And felt the polar night your gashes sear, And died in torture, but to fix him here? And ye! the plumed and trampling chivalry, Who rode on Leipsic's plain of death to die; And met the German sword, and fiery shower, To save him for another, fiercer hour! It came;—ye last, consummate sacrifice! Wing ye not here in deeper agonies? Ye, round whose hearts still hangs the clotted blood, Whose flesh is still the Flemish raven's food; Rolls not upon the wind your countless train, With cloudier visages of shame and pain? Yet in the field ye fell. Ne'er battle soil Such booty bore, where corpses were the spoil; And he, for whom ye bled, on whom your eye Turn'd in its dimness, dared do all but die! Ye massacred! behold the prize ye won; The throne, and him who sat upon that throne. The heavens were sick of crime,—the endless strife Where black ambition flung its stake of life. The trial came.—On rush'd, with shout and ban, The rebel hosts, their Idol in the van; Strength of their heart, and wonder of their eye; Illusive glory, for his hour was nigh. Their rites of blood arose. In vain the name Of their dark Baal echoed. Evening came.— Then the true thunders roll'd. Their livid gaze Saw the horizon one advancing blaze; They saw it smite their Idol on his throne; And he was smote,—pomp, art, illusion, gone. Then died his worshippers. The jealous steel Raged through their quivering ranks with faithful zeal The sacrifice was done! and on its wing The earth sent up the shout of thanksgiving. I Kings, chap. 18. END OF THE FIRST PART. PART II. “The Stygian throng Bent their aspéct, and whom they wish'd beheld, Their mighty chief return'd.” “A greater power Now ruled him, punish'd in the shape he sinn'd, According to his doom.” MILTON. NOTE. The former part of this Poem touched on the revolutionary memorials of Paris. The time was supposed to occupy the Morning and the Noon. The present view occupies the Evening, to the verge of Night. Its chief objects are, “The Louvre Gallery,” “The Venetian Horses,” “The Defeat in Russia,” “Napoleon's Exile,” “The Death of Louis XVI.” “George the Third,” &amp;c. I. King of the past, proud sitter by the grave Where nations slumber; pale Antiquity! What thousand shapes obey thy sceptre's wave! Chieftains, with all their hosts like clouds, rush by; Sages whose thrones are bright in yonder sky; Genius with all her sons, whose thoughts were wings; Beauty, whose glance bade empires live and die; Wild hearts that drank of passion's fiery springs, All from their shadowy world thy mighty sceptre brings. II. Prince, warrior, priest—the crown, the helm, the hood, Ev'n on this spot, rose, sway'd, and sank away. Above that golden gate! Napoleon stood— The curse and omen of our evil day; Gathering, like thunderclouds, his last array, That went to battle, ne'er to come again; Their Xerxes shed no tear! they went to slay; Vengeance awoke at last, and they were slain! And now—above it waves the Lily's exiled vane! III. There stands his Arch of victory, but there Its idol stands no more.—His day is done! Close by the pile sits Austria's cuirassier, Busy and gazing groups are on it strown, A wain is at its foot, as if for one Who on that crowded scaffold came to die; And the quick murmurings there, the engine's groan, Short, deep, give semblance of a dying cry: France, on that scaffold ends thy gloomy sovereignty. IV. For, thence must stoop the glorious Grecian steeds That his fierce hand had yoked to Victory's wheel. Now following where a newer conqueror leads, To thy blue waters, Venice, bends their heel! Trophies! how oft has steel thus shiver'd steel, Since first their wanderings fix'd the doom of war! But lives not in those fiery fronts a spell? Were not those orb'd eyes moulded, when the air Of midnight shook and glowed with the red comet's glare? V. Ye stars! bright legions that, before all time, Camped on yon plain of sapphire, what shall tell Your burning myriads, but the eye of Him Who bade through heaven your golden chariots wheel? Yet who earthborn can see your hosts, nor feel Immortal impulses—Eternity? What wonder if the o'erwrought soul should reel With its own weight of thought, and the wild eye See fate within your tracks of sleepless glory lie? VI. For ye behold the Mightiest! From that steep What ages have worshipp'd round your King! Ye heard his trumpet sounded o'er Earth's sleep; Ye heard the morning angels o'er it sing; Upon that orb, above me quivering, Gazed Adam from his bower in paradise. The wanderers of the Deluge saw it spring Above the buried world, and hail'd its rise, Lighting their lonely track with Faith's celestial dyes. VII. On Calvary shot down that purple eye, When, but the soldier and the sacrifice All were departed.—Mount of Agony! But Time's broad pinion, ere the giant dies, Shall cloud your dome.—Ye fruitage of the skies, Your vineyard shall be shaken!—From your urn, Censers of Heaven! no more shall glory rise, Your incense to the Throne!—The heavens shall burn: For all your pomps are dust, and shall to dust return. VIII. Yet, look ye living intellects.—The trine Of waning planets speaks it not decay? Does Schedir's staff of diamond wave no sign? Monarch of midnight, Sirius, shoots thy ray Undimm'd, when thrones sublunar pass away? Dreams!—yet if e'er was graved in vigil wan Your spell on gem or imaged alchemy, The sign when empire's hour-glass downwards ran, 'Twas on that arch, graved on that brazen talisman. IX. Greece! thou wast still a country,—Memory bleeds To think how early died that glorious name! Yet still 'twas glorious, while the matchless Steeds Stood on thy Isthmus gate.—The Roman came, Red from the fight, his eagle's wing of flame Waving o'er idol shields, and wolf-crests tall; Then widow'd Corinth groan'd, in all her shame, To see the Lictors mount the pedestal. Then Greece was doom'd to fall; a deadly, final fall. X. The glass ran down! The immortal Steeds again Must set to rise, like empire's fatal star; Rome, the world's vanquisher, seem'd vanquished then. The unhelm'd Roman beat his breast afar, The spoilers march'd in pomp of eastern war. There loured from elephants the turban'd brow, There archers gleam'd on camel and on car, And there, in gold and gem's barbaric glow, Triumph'd the purpled Greek—the King of Kings below. XI. But stronger omens chill the idolater; Above the standards towers a Cross of red. Oh, if he knew that sign, no sign of fear! Rome's crown is rent; now may her Pontiff shed The ashes on his brow, her Augur spread His eyes to mark the lightning o'er his shrine. The hour has come! The mystic steeds have fled, The Eagle stoops before the Cross divine; Empire has gone, to dwell with mighty Constantine. XII. The glass ran down! Long had the coursers stood, Of Fate and Empire the unchanged record; Long had the Eastern Harlot's cup of blood Made drunk the nations at her midnight board; Long had the martyr's groan from racks been pour'd; Their graves cried out, the winds bore up the cry, And it was heard, and in the West the sword Was girded on the Christian champion's thigh: Woe to her turban'd front of pride and blasphemy. XIII. A hostile trumpet summon'd.—'Twas a sound That ne'er before had pierced her jewell'd ear. On her indignant brow the helm was bound, With giant grasp she seized the mace and spear. She look'd upon the sea.—A cross was there, Red as her own, and with it rush'd a train, That seem'd like Ocean's lords their barks to steer, An endless cloud of mast, and sheet, and vane, Tempest of wrath and woe, with blood for all the rain. XIV. I must to other themes, yet thought delays As o'er a noble grave, above the scene, Brought by that hour before me;—morning's blaze Flaming on wall, and shore, and surge of green; The galleys, like a wood, the capes between, Then flashing onwards;—on the foremost prow A warrior who his ninetieth year has seen, To whom the ring of gold-mail'd princes bow, As if to War grown old, immortal Dandolo!— XV. Constantinople!—then thy shout arose, And from thy ramparts roll'd the mystic flame Unquenchable—The ranks of battle close: The galleys rush'd with catapult and ram, Like hail the lances from the turrets came, And decks were fired, and champions downwards flung, Till wall, and shore, and surge in crimson swam. 'Twas noon, the Grecian trumpet fainter rung; At eve the Red-cross knights their hymn of triumph sung! XVI. Then saw the Hippodrome the Genoese spear, For the bright Steeds must sail the western sea; And round the Circus gallop'd in career, With blazon'd shield, helm barr'd, and lance at knee, Like towers of steel, the German Chivalry. The Venice mariner, in cap and plume, And gold-seam'd gabardine, look'd on with glee; The Greek stood rapt, as by an opening tomb, As if his spirit saw the Turk in Sophia's Dome. XVII. The glass ran down! and Venice must resign The talisman of empire to the Gaul. Her emerald ring no more must wed the brine. Feebly she falls, yet more than she must fall: A thousand years had stood her sacred wall, The Isthmus-guard to lovely Italy; And now the horn has blown the final call That bids in chains another Corinth lie, Another Greece bow down to blood and perfidy. XVIII. A throng was in St. Mark's, but 'twas no throng Like that, which o'er the Adriatic foam Had borne the Steeds with warrior shout and song, Then fix'd them for long glory o'er the dome: She sinn'd, and now the hour of wrath was come; Though 'twas the robber made the adult'ress bare: The crowd were fierce-eyed men with pike and drum And brazen gun, and tri-colour's broad glare; The pale Venetian stood aloof, in weak despair. XIX. Such is the spoil of Time!—Unhallowed thought! Empires might stand, unshaken as their globe. But which has worn its ermine without spot? 'Twas Justice, and not Time that tore their robe. What sent the steel their pamper'd hearts to probe? 'Twas their own blow, no matter by what name, Conspirator, or conqueror, monarch, mob. They built their pile, then Judgment sent the flame, To rid the earth of guilt, the wearied heaven of shame. XX. 'Tis not in mockery of man that earth Is strewed with splendid fragments, temple, tower; That realms, where glory sprang full arm'd to birth, Are desolate, the snake and tiger's bower;— They lie the monuments of evil power, Not freaks of chance, but warnings against crime; And ancient Nineveh, to earth's last hour, Had she been pure, might stand as in her prime; Nay, stand in growing pomp, till God had finish'd time. XXI. England! my great, my glorious,—loved with love That almost makes a portion of the soul; The hour has come to fix thine eye above. There lie the thunders thou alone must roll, And roll upon thyself;—There spreads the scroll, Where thine own hand must write thy destiny. None can decide but thou, if wolves shall howl, And the black viper in thy temples lie. Be holy, and thou 'rt saved; England, thou must not die! XXII. Again the glass runs down! The Steeds must range; Aye, till the tangled web of Time be spun. Thou King of Kings, above all chance or change, When shall this toil and strife of earth be done; When his Great Year be roll'd by Empire's sun? Come to our world, thou Triumpher, whose train Are cherubim, and take thy promised throne. Come Conqueror of man's misery, death's chain. Come, first-born from the dead, and reign, for ever reign! XXIII. The Louvre halls are fill'd with strange turmoil Of axe and hammer, steps and voices loud, For there the victors seize a noble spoil; 'Twas won by England's arm in Soignié's wood. Yon bayonets still are rusty with the blood That drench'd its dark ravines. The struggle's o'er, So may the restless rancour be subdued. The final lesson's given. The might that tore That matchless prize from France, proclaimed, “Go sin no more.” XXIV. Kingly and broad ascends the Parian stair, Fit entrance to the regal glories nigh; And toilsome 'tis to make the passage there, Through its thick crowd incessant rushing by. The summit gain'd,—like lightning on the eye, Bursts the deep vision, from the stately door, One colour'd splendour, far as glance can fly, Gold, marble, giant mirror, o'er and o'er, Flashing in sun-like streams from fretted vault to floor. XXV. These were thy spoil, sad Italy: the prey Of slaves that sent thy glories to the tomb. Still on thy odour-breathing heaven the day Awoke on roses, and the evening gloom Sail'd down the azure on as soft a plume As ever fann'd the air in Summer's bower; But the high voice that bade the nations come To love and worship, parted in that hour. These were thy crown of stars, thy soul, thy living power! XXVI. Yet these are thy revenge.—The spoiler's spoil'd;— Ev'n on this spot is given the deadliest blow; Here on the robber's head his crime recoil'd. Strange scene, of wonderers hasting to and fro, And soldiers on their posts parading slow, And the fix'd native with his livid glare, And woman with her ready burst of woe, And eager artists scaffolded in air, Catching its pomps before that dazzling wall is bare. XXVII. But man and earth have vanish'd from the eye, Once on its host of silent beauty roll'd, Ranged in their tribes, ascending majesty! Holland's fine touch, the Flanders pencil bold, Superb Venetian, pearl and purple stoled; Romantic Lombard, fiery Florentine, Brightening, as up the Alp the evening's gold From the deep vineyard to the crown of pine, Till, on the marble peak, 'tis mix'd with heaven,—divine! XXVIII. What are those tablets round me? Living minds— The mighty soul in form and pressure wrought;— Unfolded natures,—where the vision winds Thro' what was dream, deep throb, unutter'd thought. There breathes Salvator! That red lightning shot From its dark throne to fire that forest hoar, That combat in its burnings madly fought, That lake convulsed beneath the tempest's roar, All in Salvator's soul toss'd, battled, burn'd, before. XXIX. And o'er them, o'er these very hues have hung The men, whom empires reckon in their fame, Kings, sages;—Here from morn till midnight clung Immortal genius, lavishing its flame. Guido for this flung down his maddening game, Startling the revellers, who saw his eyes Flashing with thoughts that like the lightnings came, And his brow clouding, as the vision'd cries Of Peter woke his own repentant agonies. XXX. Here, Raphael! is reveal'd the mystery, That fixed the hectic crimson on thy cheek— Here sank the earnest radiance of thine eye, Dying beneath th'empassioned thoughts, that wreck Spirits like thine;—Those eagle flights that seek And perish in the sun-beams;—glorious fires, That from their heaven around the mountain break With crowning splendour, till the storm retires, Leaving but smoke and dust, of all its marble spires. XXXI. Behold the Masterpiece,—as not with hands Of human weakness wrought! how fiercely cold That boy, divested of his nature, stands, Maddening!—his eye in wild possession roll'd! How shrinks the father from his stony hold! What sorrow in the kneeling sister's eye Turns on the group of more than mortal mould, That o'er him all their words of wonder try, All vain, all vanquish'd, he must writhe, and waste, and die. XXXII. The hope of hopes is there! but to the mount Scarce dare their holy hands or eye-balls turn. For on its brow, amid a fiery fount, He floats, by his instinctive virtue borne, He, for whose wounds the tribes of earth shall mourn, Transfigured, in the majesty divine. Jerusalem! that glory was thy scorn, Thy king was made a mockery and a sign, A thousand years!—His blood is still on thee and thine! XXXIII. Resplendent Titian! what a host of thoughts, What memories of stars and midnight moons, And long hours pass'd beneath the emerald vaults Of forests, and the sweet eve's thousand tunes, When the breeze rushes through the vine-festoons, Show'ring their dew-drops; are concentred here! And forms of prince and knight in proud saloons, And dames with dark Italian eyes, that ne'er Knew sorrow, or but wept the heart's bewitching tear. XXXIV. Prometheus of the pencil! life and light Burst on the canvass from thy mighty hand, All hues sublime that ever dazzled sight Where tempests die on heaven; or ever waned On hills, the evening's azure thrones, or stain'd Ruby or beryl in their Indian cell, Or glanced from gem-dropt wing, or blossom vein'd, Or tinged in ocean-caves the radiant shell, All, at thy sceptre's wave, from all their fountains swell. XXXV. There shines thy trophy! a delicious maze Of forest paths luxuriant, where the sun Sinks, like a far-off city in a blaze, In purple sheathing trunk and umbrage dun. But there a fearful vengeance has begun! The sword of wrath is in the victim's brain, The Bigot's race of blood in blood is run. He falls—his eye-ball writhes with mortal pain, Yet flashes fiery pride. He struggles,—faints,—he's slain. XXXVI. But lo! the East is deepening; and the shade Floats in grey softness down the gorgeous Hall, Veiling the crimson cheek and glossy braid; And wreathing in its slow and sweeping pall Mirror, and bust, and Parian capital. Silence is throned,—in distance dies the tread,— And in the gloom its kings and champions all, Sitting with truncheon'd hand and hoary head, Seem spirits from the grave, a council of the dead! XXXVII. But eve still glows on every shaft and plinth, And painted roof and sculptured architrave In the rich halls below; that Labyrinth,— Whose people are the gods of sky and wave, Idols! that Greece to the world's worship gave, The madness, dream, delight of sterner days, Till Greece was but a name—a fetter'd slave. Here is their shrine;—and the sweet sun delays, As on their golden domes of old he loved to gaze. XXXVIII. Are they but stone?—Ay, many an age the wave Has beat on beds as precious, and the sheep Has nibbled the wild vine-shoots round the cave Where their white beauty slept, and still might sleep, Had not the master-chisel plunging deep Awoke the living image from the stone. Was their Creator born to swell the heap Of earth's decay,—be measured by a moon? The soul's supremacy decrees the soul its throne! XXXIX. Tombs are deceivers—What a mass of mind Were church-yards,—if the chambers of the brain Dungeon'd the spirit! Sceptic, grasp the wind, Rule the outgoings of the storm, then chain The fiery thought that neither mount nor main, Not earth, heaven, time, nor thou, Eternity, With thy dark-frowning grandeur, can restrain. There lies the house of bondage, let it lie! The ransom'd slave's gone forth—his freedom was to die. XL. I have descended to the ancient vault, And held communion with the remnants there. What saw I then? I saw the velvet rot; I saw the massive brass, like cobwebs, tear; Shewing within its rents a shape of fear, A wreck of man; from which the reptile stole Scared by the light.—Decaying slumberer, The thunders on thine ear unheard might roll! Is this pale ruin the tomb, the temple of the soul! XLI. Oh! misery if it were: That gliding worm Might make its mock of us,—it feeds and then Is full and happy—and the lordliest form That ever ruled its fellow-wretches, men— What were it but the lion in the den, Biting its fetters, groaning for the sweep Of its strong sinews?—Better, not have been, Than desperate gaze on heaven's forbidden steep, Than feel this world a woe; the next, death, ashes, sleep! XLII. But the freed spirit's gone;—upon the floods, The rolling of whose waves is life, 'tis gone! And it has mingled with the diadem'd crowds That wing above the light of star or sun, It lives at last,—its being has begun! Ay, from the moment that its clouded eye Closed on the chamber hush'd and taper dun, It gazed on things unutterable, high Above all height,—all hope;—on Immortality! XLIII. Now, to the world again.—The thought has past!— It came, and for itself made words, and now Has gone—as fitful as the summer blast. Again I see imperial overthrow, The halls resound with heavy crash and blow, Engines and trooping feet, and labour's cries; For there the God of many a realm lies low, Unthroned, upon the floor's mosaic dyes, Yet worshipp'd still, the love, the wonder of all eyes. XLIV. That crowd itself a wonder; half the world Seem'd to have sent it for some final deed. There gazed the deep-brow'd Calmuck, that unfurl'd His flag by China's wall:—In wolfskin weed The bearded Bashkir with his lance of reed;— There the bold hunter, nursed beneath thy sky, Tyrol, his Austrian master's strength and dread;— There the helm'd Prussian—vengeance in his eye, Till the last debt is paid to bitter memory. XLV. There the green Russian, that across thy wave, Wild Euxine! shoots his glance of wrath and scorn On the proud Sultanry, stupendous grave! Where Power sits throned in shadowy pomp forlorn Beneath the Crescent's swift-declining horn. There towers, in gold and scarlet harnessries, The lordly Briton, by whose lance was borne The Godless to the earth, no more to rise! Champion of Man and Heaven—the ransom'd world's his prize. XLVI. But all is rapture, reverence round one shrine, Arch'd by the sunset with a burst of rays; A form seems floating out, a youth divine, Half throned, half mantled in the amber haze,— High scorn, instinctive power are in his gaze; His bow is scarce relax'd, his shaft scarce flown, His arm uplifted still, his tress still plays; He bends to catch the Python's dying groan, Yet bends as if that spot were his Olympian throne. XLVII. King of the sun-beams—on the silvery shore Of Delos stood thy glory, and thy name Rose solemn from its caves and forests hoar; And ever on its waves proud pilgrims came Bearing upon their barks the incense-flame; Bards, warriors, kings, with laurel-wreath and lyre, Bound to the Mystic Isle, where life—a dream, A lovely dream! nor cradle knew nor pyre; Greece! like thy early heart; its fire, all hallow'd fire! XLVIII. The Persian millions came.—Thy oracle In thunder o'er them utter'd Destiny! From the barbarian's hand down dropped the steel, Back rush'd their prows, it told they came to die! Silent as death, the trump, the warrior cry,— The slave, the satrap on his galley-throne, The Monarch in his jewell'd canopy! All prostrate, till afar their hosts were gone, Girding the waters blue, a golden, sunset zone. XLIX. Then, answering thunders from the Olympian hill Roll'd their deep summons to the yeasty waves, To come, and of destruction have their fill: And the ten thousand billows all were graves. And on his charger through the turban'd slaves Rode bloody Death from mountain-top to shore; Calling the wolf and wild-dog from their caves, And the young lion from his forest hoar, To glut their burning jaws with kings' and princes' gore. L. Laocoon! round thy splendid form are flung Inextricable spires,—twin serpents chain Thy mighty limbs,—like fire, the forky tongue Shoots o'er thy brow, that writhes with more than pain; Their plunging fangs thy patriot life-blood drain, Their volumes clasp thy sons, and all must die,— But wrath and wrong are burning in thy brain, Upon thy boys is fix'd no father's eye; 'Tis cast on Heaven, in bold, accusing agony. LI. Beside him sinks a warrior on his shield, Whose history the heart alone must tell! Now, dim in eve—he looks, as on the field, Where when he fell, his country with him fell. Death sickens all his soul, the blood-drops steal Slow from his breast, congealing round the wound; His strong arm shakes, his chest has lost its swell, 'Tis his last breath,—his eye-ball glares profound, His heavy forehead glooms, bends, plunges, to the ground! LII. Yet had the bold barbarian joy; if tears For Roman slaughter could rejoice his soul. Did he not hear the crashing of the spears? When like a midnight tide, his warriors stole Around the slumb'ring legions—till the roll Of the wild forest-drum awoke the glen; And every blow let loose a Roman soul. So let them sting the lion in his den; Chains and the spear are chaff, when Heaven gives hearts to men! LIII. Had not that with'ring lip quaff'd long and deep, The cup that vengeance for the patriot fills; When swords instinctive from their scabbards leap, When the dim forests, and the mighty hills, And the lone gushings of the mountain rills, All utter to the soul a cry of shame; And shame, like drops of molten brass, distils On the bare head and bosom of the tame, Till the whole fetter'd man, heart, blood, and brain, is flame. LIV. Then there were lightnings in that clouded eye, And sounds of triumph in that heavy ear; Aye, and that icy limb was bounding nigh, Tracking the Roman with the bow and spear, As through the live-long night the death-march drear Pierced the deep forests o'er the slaughter grown; Seeking for ancient chief and comrade dear, Through wolf-torn graves and haggard piles of bone, Along the rampart ruins, and marshy trenches strown. LV. And what they sought they found, in wild-weed robes, Laid in the sepulchres that thunder ploughs. They found the circle, where the thronging globes Of German warriors held the night's carouse, And groans of death, and Magic's fearful vows Startled the moon. Around the altars lay The human hecatomb! in ghastly rows, The leaders still unmix'd with meaner clay, Tribune and consul stretch'd in white and wild decay. LVI. But have I still forgot thee, loveliest far Of all,—enchanting image of Love's queen? Or did I linger but till yon blue star, Thy star, should crown thee with its light serene? There stands the goddess, by the Grecian seen In the mind's lonely, deep idolatry; When twilight o'er Cythera's wave of green, Drew her rich curtain, and his upturn'd eye Was burning with the pomps of earth, and sea, and sky. LVII. Then came the dreamer's glorious ecstasy; And from the vale of lilies, and the wood Blushing with Persian roses, breathed the sigh Of more than music; and the spell-bound flood Bore on its waveless breast a living cloud, Chariots of pearl, and proud sea-horses curb'd, That with their breasts the green to silver plough'd; And nymphs and tritons lifting trumpets orb'd, Young Venus! round thy throne, in its own light absorb'd. LVIII. The shore is reach'd, and fear, bewitching fear, Is in her bending form, and glancing eye, And veiling hand, and timid-turning ear; She listens,—'twas but Eve's enamour'd sigh! Yet has it heaved her bosom's ivory— Yet has it on the shore her footstep spell'd; 'Tis past.—The rustling rose alone is nigh,— She smiles; and in that smile is all reveal'd The charm, to which so soon the living world shall yield. LIX. There is a vital richness in the air, That comes in gushes on this fading hour; And, stately France! though Attic taste might stare At thy strange garden freaks of fount and bower; There lives a little soother, where one flower Springs from its turf, a soother meant for man; Perhaps to win his heart with silent power To fields and peaceful thoughts from cities wan, Where it so oft “disquieteth itself in vain.” LX. Night's wing is on the east—the clouds repose Like weary armies of the firmament, Encamp'd beneath their vanes of pearl and rose; Till the wind's sudden trumpet through them sent, Shakes their pavilions, and their pomps are blent In rich confusion. Now the air is fill'd With thousand odours, sigh'd by blossoms bent In closing beauty, where the dew distill'd From Evening's airy urns their purple lips has chill'd. LXI. How subtly Nature mingles in the heart The past, the future, in this lovely time! How home and heaven together on us start! England! 'tis now thy autumn-sky sublime Reminds us of the parted spirit's clime, The hamlet clock strikes solemn as a knell; The sinking breeze that wafts the distant chime, The heavy harvest-team's returning bell, The gleaner's homeward call, seem life's sad, sweet farewell. LXII. But thousands, tens of thousands in thy fields Are counting every shade that dims this hour, With frequent sunward look till day-light yields, And each can turn him to the humble bower, Where his own hand has planted every flower; Time out of mind his father's quiet home; Where waits him one, whose virtue was her dower, Cheering her infants, as the deepening gloom, Shed from the poplars, tells, he sure and soon will come. LXIII. He comes; the moon has lit him home at last, And he has thrown his harvest hook away, And kiss'd the nut-brown babes that round him haste, Each with the little wonder of its day. The lowly meal is spread, the moon-beams play Through panes that bushy rose and wall-flower veil, And soon to make them music, on her spray, Her wonted, neighbour spray, the nightingale Pours on the holy hour her thrilling, endless tale. LXIV. The breeze has fall'n—but sudden symphonies Swell from beyond the gate and statued wall; As if they echoed from the breathless skies, The wavings of the night's o'ershadowing pall. I am no weeper, but their rise and fall Disturbs me,—Is the soul a harp whose strings Vibrate tumultuous tones at music's call? A fount, that when her touch unseals its springs Gushes through all its old, enchanted wanderings? LXV. There is a flash of steel through yonder trees, A wave of standards and a toss of plumes O'er scarlet ranks, like foam-bursts upon seas Ruddy with lightnings.—Hark! those well-known drums Rolling along the shadowy camp, as comes The night breeze rolling, then with distant wing Sunk in wild music.—Now along the glooms Echoes the silver trumpet, cymbals ring, 'Tis England's martial hymn!—there swells, “God save the King.” LXVI. “God save the King”—a thousand shapes of war, Of valour, freedom, glorious suffering, In sudden vision crowd the marble air, Raised at the sound. Yet fearful memories fling Their darkness on the spirit.—Here a king Laid down his sacred head and died!—Oh, crime, What torrents of black carnage were to spring? What havoc of the rebel nation's prime? Before her soul repaid that monarch's death sublime? LXVII. Paris! there was no sleep beneath thy roofs The morn that saw that deed. The dim streets rung, Long before day, with cannon, trampling hoofs, And, fearfullest of all, the Tocsin's tongue. Startling the eye, the passing torches flung Their flash through many a chamber from beneath, Then vanish'd with the thick and hurrying throng; While the heart-sinking listener held his breath, Catching in every sound the distant roar of death. LXVIII. But earlier than that dim and early hour A lonely taper twinkled through the gloom; 'Twas from the casement of the Temple tower; 'Twas from a king's, a martyr's, dungeon-room! There he subdued his spirit for its doom; And one old priest, and one pale follower, Knelt weeping, as beside their master's tomb. Rude was the altar, but the heart was there, And peace and solemn hope were in that prison prayer. LXIX. But trumpets peal'd, and torches glared below; And from the tower rose woman's loud lament And infant cries; and shadows seem'd to go With tossing arms, and heads in anguish bent, Backwards and forwards hurrying, then, as spent, Sink down, and all be silent for a time; Until the royal victims' souls were rent With some new yell of cruelty and crime, Or thunder'd through the dusk the Tocsin's deadly chime. LXX. The morning came in clouds; the winter's blast Swept down in stormy gusts, then sank away In ominous moanings, chilling, as it past, The thousands posted in their stern array. There was no opening door, no sound of day, No song, no cry along the pale Boulevard; And, save some ghastly banner's distant play, Some clang, when in the gust the lances jarr'd, All stretch'd before the eye one endless charnel yard. LXXI. And 'twas as wild and still within the square, This square of luxury Place Louis Quinze.! The morn arose; An iron harvest bristled through the air, Bayonet and pike in countless, close-lock'd rows. Silent as death the crowd,—the grim repose Before the earthquake;—None from roof or wall Might look; no hand the casement might unclose. And in their centre, frowning o'er them all, Their idol—the sole god before whose name they fall: LXXII. The Guillotine!—when Hell prepared the feast, Where guilty France was drunk, but not with wine; Till madness sat upon her vision'd breast,— This was the press that crush'd her bloody vine. To this grim altar came the shuddering line, Whose worship was,—beneath its knife to lie; The haggard traitors to the throne and shrine, By traitors crush'd, that in their turn must die; Till massacre engulph'd the wreck of Liberty. LXXIII. The Guillotine.—It stood in that pale day Like a huge spectre, just from earth upsprung, To summon to the tomb the fierce array That round its feet in desperate homage clung. But on the wind a sudden trumpet rung. All eyes were turn'd, and far as eye could stray, Was caught a light, from moving helmets flung, A banner tossing in the tempest's sway, A wain, that through the throng slow toil'd its weary way. LXXIV. He comes—the monarch on the scaffold stands; The headsmen grasp him!—Of the thousands there, That hear his voice, that see his fetter'd hands, Not one has given a blessing or a tear; But that old priest who answers him in prayer. He speaks; his dying thoughts to France are given, His voice is drown'd; for murder has no ear. The patient victim to the axe is driven. Then cried the blood, whose cry is heard from Earth to Heaven! LXXV. The grave must tell, when it gives up its dead, Their after hours who o'er that blood blasphemed; What myriads perish'd on a bloody bed, By the pursuing hoof and sabre seam'd; What haughty heads upon the scaffold stream'd, What eyes rain'd anguish in the den and chain, When on their dying hour this moment gleam'd; What wretches felt it maddening all their pain, From Moscow funeral fires to Belgium's gory plain. LXXVI. France was anathema.—Her cup before Was full, but this o'ertopp'd its burning brim. And plagues like serpent-teeth her entrails tore; Crime rush'd to ravage through a land of crime! In the sack'd sepulchre caroused the mime; On God's high altar sat Idolatry; Before the harlot knelt the nation's prime, And sons dragg'd fathers, fathers sons to die; 'Till Judgment girt the bow on its eternal thigh. LXXVII. This was our nature freed from God and king! This was Rebellion's consummated dream! Evil unchain'd,—all tortured, torturing; The light of life, a wildering phantom-gleam, A vapour of the hot and livid stream Pour'd from the gory fount of Regicide; The strife of madness,—fiery hearts, that teem With shapes of guilt that but that den could hide; Gnashings, and taunts, and groans, ascending wild and wide. LXXVIII. And by that place of torment England sate Like a bright spirit with unsleeping eyes, Commission'd to keep watch at Hell's dark gate; Hearing within its voice of agonies, Seeing its smokes of restless torture rise, Itself unstain'd; and on that fearful guard, Still holding high communion with the skies; Still on its brow the helmet-diadem starr'd, The splendid plume still pure, the angel cheek unmarr'd. LXXIX. France was in dust,—a dying funeral pyre; But from its embers sprang a sudden throne, That round the kingdoms shot resistless fire. In its pavilion sate a fearful one, Alone in power, in gloomy guilt alone; Stern, subtle, selfish;—cruelty his sword, Apostacy upon his brow the crown, He sat the homicidal empire's lord; Heaven's instrument of woe, man's fear, ador'd, abhorr'd. LXXX. His glance look'd o'er the nations as a field For slaughter,—and his trumpet rang their knell; For they were stain'd, and Faith's high temper'd shield Sank from their grasp before the infidel. Then did his heart with impious boastings swell; Salmoneus! 'tis thy tale of mockery. His meanest thought was might and miracle, His idlest word an omen from on high, And France, a ready slave, re-echoed all the lie. LXXXI. But rushing from its clouds, a viewless grasp Seized the impostor in his car of flame, And cleft the crown, and tore the vesture's clasp, And show'd him as he was!—The nations came Around in laughter stern, and lofty shame, To see the tyrant bend his naked brow, Fawning for abject life,—the tiger tame— Dragging his chains,—the rabble's vagrant show, Licking the dust before his first, last, noblest foe. LXXXII. Was this the work of man? Eternal King, Thou hearer of the orphan's midnight cry! What tribute shall the ransom'd empires bring For that new life of life, for Liberty. Earth had been one wide dungeon but for thee, And man had lived in woe, in woe had died. In vain the mighty hills, the surging sea, Where could the victim from the oppressor hide, When all her regions lay beneath one iron stride? LXXXIII. The veil is rent above us. 'Twas a word Omnipotent, which check'd that final hour. It summon'd not the faithful warrior's sword; The world stood hush'd at its descending power. Then follow'd its fierce armies, cloud and shower, The hail that shot its arrows from on high, The blast that on the atheist host burn'd frore, The storm that roll'd like midnight on the sky, To make the deadly sheet in which their limbs must lie. LXXXIV. Magnificence of ruin! what has time In all it ever gazed upon of war, Of the wild rage of storm, or deadly clime, Seen, with that battle's vengeance to compare? How glorious shone the invader's pomp afar? Like pamper'd lions from the spoil they came; The land before them silence and despair, The land behind them massacre and flame; Blood will have tenfold blood.—What are they now? a name. LXXXV. Homeward by hundred thousands, column deep, Broad square, loose squadron, rolling like the flood When mighty torrents from their channels leap, Rush'd through the land the haughty multitude, Billow on endless billow; on through wood, O'er rugged hill, down sunless, marshy vale, The death-devoted moved, to clangor rude Of drum and horn and dissonant clash of mail, Glancing disastrous light before that sun-beam pale. LXXXVI. Again they reached thee, Borodino! still Upon the loaded soil the carnage lay, The human harvest, now stark, stiff and chill, Friend, foe, stretch'd thick together, clay to clay; In vain the startled legions burst away; The land was all one naked sepulchre, The shrinking eye still glanced on grim decay, Still did the hoof and wheel their passage tear Through cloven helms and arms, and corpses mould'ring drear. LXXXVII. The field was as they left it; fosse and fort Steaming with slaughter still, but desolate,— The cannon flung dismantled by its porte; Each knew the mound, the black ravine whose strait Was won and lost, and throng'd with dead, till fate Had fixed upon the victor—half undone. There was the hill, from which their eyes elate Had seen the burst of Moscow's golden zone; But death was at their heels, they shudder'd and rush'd on. LXXXVIII. The hour of vengeance strikes. Hark to the gale! As it bursts hollow through the rolling clouds, That from the north in sullen grandeur sail Like floating Alps. Advancing darkness broods Upon the wild horizon, and the woods, Now sinking into brambles, echo shrill, As the gust sweeps them, and those upper floods Shoot on their leafless boughs the sleet drops chill, That on the hurrying crowds in freezing showers distil. LXXXIX. They reach the Wilderness! The majesty Of solitude is spread before their gaze, Stern nakedness,—dark earth, and wrathful sky. If ruins were there, they long had ceased to blaze; If blood was shed, the ground no more betrays Even by a skeleton the crime of man; Behind them rolls the deep and drenching haze Wrapping their rear in night, before their van The struggling day-light shows the unmeasur'd desert wan. XC. Still on they sweep, as if their hurrying march Could bear them from the rushing of his wheel Whose chariot is the whirlwind. Heaven's clear arch At once is covered with a livid veil, In mixed and fighting heaps the deep clouds reel, Upon the dense horizon hangs the sun, In sanguine light, an orb of burning steel; The snows wheel down through twilight, thick and dun; Now tremble men of blood, the Judgment has begun! XCI. The trumpet of the northern winds has blown, And it is answer'd by the dying roar Of armies on that boundless field o'erthrown: Now in the awful gusts the desert hoar Is tempested, a sea without a shore, Lifting its feathery waves. The legions fly; Volley on volley, down the hailstones pour;— Blind, famish'd, frozen, mad, the wanderers die, And dying, hear the storm but wilder thunder by. XCII. Such is the hand of heaven! A human blow Had crush'd them in the fight, or flung the chain, Round them where Moscow's stately towers were low, And all be still'd. But Thou! thy battle plain Was a whole empire; that devoted train Must war from day to day with storm and gloom, (Man following, like the wolves, to rend the slain,) Must lie from night to night as in a tomb, Must fly, toil, bleed for home; yet never see that home. XCIII. The despot 'scaped; for his was yet to show What mimes may play ambition's haughtiest part, To show the recreant branded on his brow, Whose noblest art was but the slaughterer's art; Lest future villains from the mire should start, And rave, and slay, and dare to call it fame. Behold him now, the man without a heart, Him of the battles,—him the soul of flame,— Scorn'd, banish'd, chain'd for life; and glad to live in shame. XCIV. He's gone!—The world in arms pronounced his ban, His wand is plunged ten thousand fathoms deep: The sword of wrath has broke his talisman; And now, to his foul tomb content to creep, The outcast wanders on the loneliest steep, That ever whiten'd to the ocean wave; A monument of blasted guilt, to weep, If his hard eye can weep, the price he gave, To meet that spot at last,—his prison and his grave. XCV. But he has perish'd, as the broken surge That at his feet now dies along the shore: The scourge's work fulfill'd—the gory scourge Is flung abhorr'd away—his world is o'er. Fool! see thy emblem; where with rush and roar The ocean-pillar whirls to meet the sky, Ploughing with giant speed the waters hoar, Fear to the distant, ruin to the nigh; It bursts—it sinks—'tis gone—its very echoes die. XCVI. Earth shook with that wild empire's overthrow; And the foundations, that as fate seem'd deep, Are dust—and England gave the final blow. France rush'd like lava from the mountain's steep, But England met it with the ocean's sweep, And o'er it roll'd in towering majesty, Leaving its burning mass, a gloomy heap. Days of our toil and triumph! ye shall die— But on the self same pile with man, and memory! XCVII. Monarch of England! in our trial-hour, Thy prayer was to thy people shield and sword; Thy secret spirit was a living power. Like his who on the mountain's brow adored When round its base the pagan battle roar'd; The lifting of thy hands was victory; A deadlier host around our mountain pour'd. Now dust and ashes on their standards lie, Why was that triumph hid from thy paternal eye! XCVIII. It was in mercy that the veil was spread! Thou didst not see the blossoms of thy throne, Mother and infant, on one dying bed. Thou didst not weep upon the sullen stone That hid thy queen; thy more than princely son; High dreams were glowing round thy lonely tower; Still lived to thee each loved and parted one; Till on thine eye-ball burst th'immortal hour, And the dead met thy gaze in angel light and power. XCIX. We talk not of the parting rites—the pomp— Our heart above our Father's grave decays. Yet all was regal there; the silver tromp, The proud procession through the Gothic maze, The silken banner, thousand torches' blaze, Gilding the painted pane, and imaged stone; The chapel's deeper glow,—the cresset's rays, Like diamonds on the wall of velvet strown; And, flashing from the roof, the helm, and gonfalon. C. Yet still the thought is hallow'd; and the train Of solemn memories o'er the mind will come With long and lofty pleasure, touch'd by pain. I hear the anthem; now, as in the tomb, Dying away;—then, through the upper gloom Roll'd, like the Judgment thunders from the cloud, Above that deep and gorgeous catacomb, Where sat the nation's mightiest, pale, and proud, Throned in their dim alcoves, each fix'd as in his shroud. CI. Still lives the vision of the kingly hall, The noble kneeling in his canopy, The prelate in his sculptured, shadowy stall, The knight beneath his falchion glittering high, All bending on a central pall the eye, Where melancholy gleams a crown of gold, An empty crown.—'Tis sinking, silently, 'Tis gone! yet does the living world not hold A purer heart than now beneath that crown is cold. CII. And ye ethereal ministrants, whose eyes Night veils not; splendid watchers of our sphere; Heard ye not rising to your solemn skies From the land's widest limits voices drear, As if in each that moment sank the bier? From mount and shore roll'd up the mighty peal, Then died!—and all was death-like on the ear. But it was gone afar, the ocean's swell Round the hush'd world had borne its noblest monarch's knell. CIII. Raise we his monument! what giant pile Shall honour him to far posterity? His monument shall be his ocean-isle, The voice of his redeeming thunders be His epitaph upon the silver sea. And million spirits from whose necks he tore The fetter, and made soul and body free; And unborn millions from earth's farthest shore Shall bless the Christian King, till the last sun is o'er. THE END. THE DEATH OF LEONIDAS. ???? ????? ?????? ????????. ?????. It was the wild midnight,— A storm was on the sky; The lightning gave its light, And the thunder echoed by. The torrent swept the glen, The ocean lash'd the shore; Then rose the Spartan men, To make their bed in gore! Swift from the deluged ground Three hundred took the shield; Then, silent, gather'd round The Leader of the field. He spoke no warrior-word, He bade no trumpet blow; But the signal-thunder roar'd, And they rush'd upon the foe. The fiery element Show'd, with one mighty gleam, Rampart, and flag, and tent, Like the spectres of a dream. All up the mountain side, All down the woody vale, All by the rolling tide Waved the Persian banners pale. And King Leonidas, Among the slumbering band, Sprang foremost from the pass, Like the lightning's living brand. Then double darkness fell, And the forest ceased its moan: But there came a clash of steel, And a distant, dying groan. Anon, a trumpet blew, And a fiery sheet burst high, That o'er the midnight threw A blood-red canopy. A host glared on the hill; A host glared by the bay; But the Greeks rush'd onwards still, Like leopards in their play. The air was all a yell, And the earth was all a flame, Where the Spartan's bloody steel On the silken turbans came. And still the Greek rush'd on Beneath the fiery fold, Till, like a rising sun, Shone Xerxes' tent of gold. They found a royal feast, His midnight banquet, there! And the treasures of the East Lay beneath the Doric spear. Then sat to the repast The bravest of the brave! That feast must be their last, That spot must be their grave. They pledged old Sparta's name In cups of Syrian wine, And the warrior's deathless fame Was sung in strains divine. They took the rose-wreath'd lyres From eunuch and from slave, And taught the languid wires The sounds that Freedom gave. But now the morning star Crown'd Œta's twilight brow; And the Persian horn of war From the hills began to blow. Up rose the glorious rank, To Greece one cup pour'd high,— Then, hand in hand, they drank “To Immortality!” Fear on King Xerxes fell, When, like spirits from the tomb, With shout and trumpet-knell, He saw the warriors come. But down swept all his power, With chariot and with charge; Down pour'd the arrowy shower, Till sank the Dorian's targe. They march'd within the tent, With all their strength unstrung; To Greece one look they sent, Then on high their torches flung. To heaven the blaze uproll'd, Like a mighty altar-fire; And the Persians' gems and gold Were the Grecians' funeral pyre. Their king sat on the throne, His captains by his side, While the flame rush'd roaring on, And their pæan loud replied! Thus fought the Greek of old! Thus will he fight again! Shall not the self-same mould Bring forth the self-same men? ON THE BUST OF THE LATE QUEEN OF PRUSSIA, IN THE KING'S CHAMBER AT BERLIN, 1812. Thy day of agony is o'er! Thou'rt angel, and shalt weep no more: In fortune's last extremity, Princess, 'twas well for thee to die. Death calms the wretched, frees the slave; Can insult follow to the grave? The tyrant now may taunt and scorn, Thy spirit can no more be torn. Oh, for the hour a Prussian's steel Shall teach his callous heart to feel! Thy cheek is still before me—pale As the last leaf on Autumn's gale; Then lit with one, swift, burning tinge, As o'er it, from thine eyes' dark fringe, Fell, drop by drop, the tears of pain, At some new galling of thy chain; Some slighting, sullen courtesy Of him who could not honour thee. And this the end of birth and bloom; Tears, terrors, exile, and the tomb!— And there is One, who, hour by hour, Has wept upon thee, broken flower! Pierced to the soul with every sting That Fate could point against a King. The Man had one more misery To meet—and met it, losing thee. Image of beauty, breathing stone, Here shrined so lovely, and so lone; Comes he not here from restless sleep To weep, as hearts alone can weep! Thy spell is on me too:—my eye Is caught, fix'd, fill'd, unconscious why; 'Tis not thy more than regal brow; Thy more than beauty; more than woe; 'Tis the deep grace, that seems to wind O'er all,—the relique of thy mind! But the dark heart that dug thy grave Shall die a recreant and a slave: Not where his routed legions lie; He must not die, as brave men die! But weary, wither'd, lost,—his name Earth's scorn, the common mark for shame; From fame, hope, empire, mankind driven, As sure as there's a Power in Heaven. That sin's not made to be forgiven! NOON. “????? ????????, ?????? ?????????.” Come, ye brown oaks, and stoop your heavy boughs, Making sweet eve around my sultry brows! Wave your white beauty, lilies; hyacinths sigh; And, woodbine, from your blossom'd canopy, Stirring the smoothness of this quiet stream, Shed on my eyes some deep, Elysian dream. And come, thou young and silken-pinion'd Wind, That the pale, virgin May, sends forth to find Her flowers, in Winter's frozen bosom sleeping; Wing round this leafy bed, in whispers creeping Like softest music on my slumb'ring ear; Until the murmur of the grasshopper, And the fresh odours of the rose's breath, Tell me that Day is faint, and nigh to death. And the small stars are waking, one by one; And to fair Thetis' couch the weary Sun is gone! THE PEN. FROM THE GREEK OF TZETZES. “???? ??????? ??????? ?????.” ?. ?. ?. I was an useless thing, a lonely reed! No blossom hung its beauty on the weed. Alike in summer's sun and winter's gloom, I sigh'd no fragrance, and I wore no bloom. No cluster wreath'd me;—day and night I pined On the wild moor, and wither'd in the wind. At length a wanderer found me.—From my side He smooth'd the pale decaying leaves, and dyed My lips in Helicon! From that high hour I spoke!—My words were flame and living power! And there was sweetness round me,—never fell Eve's sweeter dews upon the lily's bell. I shone!—night died!—as if a trumpet call'd, Man's spirit rose, pure, fiery, disenthrall'd! Tyrants of earth, ye saw your light decline, When I stood forth, a wonder and a sign! To me the iron sceptre was a wand, The roar of nations peal'd at my command; To me the dungeon, sword, and scourge, were vain, I smote the smiter, and I broke the chain: Or towering o'er them all, without a plume, I pierced the purple air, the tempest's gloom; Till burst th'Olympian splendours on my eye, Stars, temples, thrones, and gods,—Infinity! THE POET'S HOUR. When day is done, and clouds are low, And flowers are honey-dew, And Hesper's lamp begins to glow Along the western blue. And homeward wing the turtle-doves, Then comes the hour the poet loves. For in the dimness curtain'd round, He hears the echoes all Of rosy vale, or grassy mound, Or distant waterfall; And shapes are on his dreaming sight, That keep their beauty for the night. And still, as shakes the sudden breeze The forest's deepening shade, He hears on Tuscan evening seas The silver serenade: Or, to the field of battle borne, Swells at the sound of trump and horn. The star that peeps the leaves between, To him is but the light That, from some lady's bower of green, Shines to her pilgrim knight; Who feels her spell around him twine, And hastens home from Palestine. Or, if some wand'ring peasant's song Come sweeten'd on the gale, He sees the cloister's saintly throng; The crosier, cross, and veil— Or hears the vespers of the nun, World-weary, lovely, and undone. And thus he thinks the hour away In sweet, unworldly folly; And loves to see the shades of gray, That feed his melancholy: Finding sweet speech and thought in all, Star, leaf, wind, song, and waterfall! CZERNI GEORGE. This man was one of the bold creations of wild countries and troubled times; beings of impetuous courage, iron strength, original talent, and doubtful morality. Civilization levels and subdues the inequalities of the general mind; barbarism shows, with the desolation, the grandeur of the wilderness,—the dwarfed and the gigantic side by side, a thousand diminished and decaying productions overshadowed by one mighty effort of savage fertility. Georges Petrowich was descended from a family of Servian nobles. His habitual name of Czerni (black) was given probably from the colour of his hair. His daring spirit first exhibited itself in an act of personal violence. When a boy, and ordered by a Turk to stand out of his way, or have his brains blown out, he shot the Turk on the spot. Hatred of the oppressors of his country was probably mingled here with individual temper. Czerni George took immediate refuge in Transylvania, and entered the Austrian service, where he was made a non-commissioned officer. He subsequently quarrelled with his captain, challenged, killed him; and fled to Servia. He was now but twenty-five, yet he raised an insurrection; fought the Turks with remorseless hostility; by signal gallantry, perseverance, and talent embodied an army of his countrymen; bore down the Turks before him, besieged Belgrade, and on the 1st of December, 1806, forced it to capitulate. He was now master of a kingdom, was proclaimed generalissimo of Servia, repelled an attempt of the senate of nobles and ecclesiastics to repossess the government, and by proclamation declared himself “Supreme.” The Mussulman power was awakened by this proximity of triumphant opposition, and an army of 50,000 men passed the Servian frontier. Czerni fought long and desperately on the banks of the Saave, but his small population gave way before the mass of the Turkish power. At the Treaty of 1812, between Russia and the Porte, Servia acknowledged herself tributary to the Sultan. Czerni retired to Russia, and lived at Kissonoff, in Bessarabia. In 1817, he had the rashness to return to Servia. He was taken in disguise near Belgrade, and immediately beheaded by order of the Pashaw. The object of his return is unascertained; it was said to be the possession of some treasure hidden during his day of success: it was supposed by the Turks to be an attempt to feel his way to massacre once more. It might have been urged by the restlessness of a vigorous mind weary of inactivity; or by the nobler impulse of giving independence to his country, at a time when Europe was exulting in the overthrow of the French Empire. His appearance was striking and singular. He was boldly formed, and above the general stature. But the extraordinary length of his physiognomy, his sunken eyes, and his bald forehead, bound with a single black tress of hair, gave him a look rather Asiatic than European. It was his custom to sit in silence for hours together; he could neither read nor write, but he was a great warrior, and, for the time, a deliverer of his country. 'Twas noon! a blood-red banner play'd Above thy rampart porte, Belgrade; From time to time the gong's deep swell Rose thundering from the citadel; And soon the trampling charger's din Told of some mustering pomp within. But all without was still and drear, The long streets wore the hue of fear, All desert, but where some quick eye Peer'd from the curtain'd gallery. Or crouching slow from roof to roof, The Servian glanced, then shrank aloof, Eager, yet dreading to look on The business to be that day done. The din grew louder, crowding feet Seem'd rushing to the central street; 'Twas fill'd; the city's idle brood Scatter'd before, few, haggard, rude: Then come the Spahis bounding on With kettle-drum and gonfalon; And ever, at the cymbal's clash, Upshook their spears the sudden flash, Till, like a shatter'd, sable sail, Wheel'd o'er their rear the black horse-tail, All hurrying on, like men who yield, Or men who seek, some final field. They lead a captive; the Pashaw From his large eye draws back with awe; All tongues are silent in the group, Who round that fearful stranger troop: He still has homage, though his hands Are straining in a felon's bands. No Moslem he; his brow is bare, Save one wild tress of raven hair, Like a black serpent deeply bound, Where once sat Servia's golden round. His neck bends low, and many a stain Of blood shows how it feels the chain; A peasant's robe is o'er him flung, A swordless sheath beside him hung; He sits a charger, but a slave Now holds the bridle of the brave. And now they line the palace-square, A splendid sight, as noon's full glare Pours on their proud caparison, Arms rough with gold and dazzling stone, Horse-nets, and shawls of Indian dye, O'er brows of savage majesty. But where's the fetter'd rider now? A flag above, a block below, An Ethiop headsman low'ring near, Show where must close his stern career. A thousand eyes are fix'd to mark The fading of his eye's deep spark, The quicken'd heaving of his breast; But all within it is at rest: There is no quivering nerve; his brow Scarce bent upon the crowd below, He stands in settled, stately gloom, A warrior's statue on his tomb. A trumpet rang;—the turban'd line Clash'd up their spears, the headsman's sign. Then, like the iron in the forge, Blazed thy dark visage, Czerni George! He knew that trumpet's Turkish wail, His guide through many a forest vale, When, scattering like the hunted deer, The Moslem felt his early spear; He heard it when the Servian targe Broke down the Delhi's desperate charge, And o'er the flight his scimitar Was like the flashing of a star: That day, his courser to the knee Was bathed in blood, and Servia free! That day, before he sheathed his blade, He stood a sovereign in Belgrade; The field, the throne were on that eye, Which wander'd now so wild and high. The hour had waned; the sunbeam fell Full on the palace pinnacle, The golden crescent on its spire Beam'd o'er a cross! his eye shot fire; That cross was o'er the crescent set, The day he won the coronet. He dash'd away a tear of pride, His hand was darted to his side, No sword was there:—a bitter smile Told the stern spirit's final thrill; Yet all not agony; afar, Mark'd he no cloud of northern war? Swell'd on his prophet ear no clang Of tribes that to their saddles sprang? No Russian cannon's heavy hail In vengeance smiting the Serail? The whole was but a moment's trance, That 'scaped the turban'd rabble's glance; A sigh, a stride, a stamp the whole, Time measures not the tides of soul. He was absorb'd in dreams, not saw The hurried glare of the Pashaw; Nor saw the headsman's backward leap, To give his axe the wider sweep. Down came the blow;—the self-same smile Was lingering on the dead lip still, When 'mid the train the pikeman bore The bloody head of the Pandour. The night was wild, the atabal Scarce echoed on the rampart wall; Scarce heard the shrinking centinel, The night-horn in that tempest's yell. But forms, as shot the lightning's glare, Stole silent through that palace-square, And thick and dim a weeping group Seem'd o'er its central spot to stoop. The storm a moment paused, the moon Broad from a hurrying cloud-rift shone; It shone upon a headless trunk, Raised in their arms; the moonbeam sunk, And all was dimness; but the beat Came sudden as of parting feet, And sweet and solemn voices pined In the low lapses of the wind. 'Twas like the hymn, when soldiers bear A soldier to his sepulchre. The lightning threw a shaft below, The stately square was desert now. Yet far, as far as eye could strain, Was seen the remnant of a train; A wavering shadow of a crowd, That round some noble burden bow'd. 'Twas gone, and all was night once more, Wild rain, and whirlwind's doubled roar. THE ANGEL OF THE WORLD. AN ARABIAN TALE. I There's glory on thy mountains, proud Bengal, When on their temples bursts the morning sun! There's glory on thy marble-tower'd wall, Proud Ispahan, beneath his burning noon! There's glory—when his golden course is done, Proud Istamboul, upon thy waters blue! But fall'n Damascus, thine was beauty's throne, In morn, and noon, and evening's purple dew, Of all from Ocean's marge to mighty Himmalu. II East of the city stands a lofty mount, Its brow with lightning delved and rent in sunder; And through the fragments rolls a little fount, Whose channel bears the blast of fire and thunder; And there has many a pilgrim come to wonder; For there are flowers unnumber'd blossoming, With but the bare and calcined marble under; Yet in all Asia no such colours spring, No perfumes rich as in that mountain's rocky ring. III And some who pray'd the night out on the hill, Have said they heard—unless it was their dream, Or the mere murmur of the babbling rill,— Just as the morn-star shot its first slant beam, A sound of music, such as they might deem The song of spirits—that would sometimes sail Close to their ear, a deep, delicious stream, Then sweep away, and die with a low wail; Then come again, and thus, till Lucifer was pale. IV And some, but bolder still, had dared to turn That soil of mystery for hidden gold; But saw strange, stifling blazes round them burn, And died:—by few that venturous tale was told. And wealth was found; yet, as the pilgrims hold, Though it was glorious on the mountain's brow, Brought to the plain it crumbled into mould, The diamonds melted in the hand like snow; So none molest that spot for gems or ingots now. V But one, and ever after, round the hill He stray'd:—they said a meteor scorch'd his sight; Blind, mad, a warning of Heaven's fearful will. 'Twas on the sacred evening of “The Flight,” His spade turn'd up a shaft of marble white, Fragment of some kiosk, the chapiter A crystal circle, but at morn's first light Rich forms began within it to appear, Sceptred and wing'd, and then, it sank in water clear. VI Yet once upon that guarded mount, no foot But of the Moslem true might press a flower, And of them none, but with some solemn suit Beyond man's help, might venture near the bower: For, in its shade, in beauty and in power, For judgement sat the Angel of the World: Sent by the prophet, till the destined hour That saw in dust Arabia's idols hurl'd, Then to the skies again his wing should be unfurl'd. VII It came at last. It came with trumpets' sounding, It came with thunders of the atabal, And warrior shouts, and Arab chargers' bounding, The Sacred Standard crown'd Medina's wall! From palace roof, and minaret's golden ball, Ten thousand emerald banners floated free, Beneath, like sun-beams, through the gateway tall, The Emirs led their steel-mail'd chivalry, And the whole city rang with sports and soldier glee. VIII This was the eve of eves, the end of war, Beginning of Dominion, first of Time! When, swifter than the shooting of a star, Mohammed saw the “Vision's” pomps sublime; Swept o'er the rainbow'd sea—the fiery clime, Heard from the throne its will in thunders roll'd; Then glancing on our world of woe and crime, Saw from Arabia's sands his banner's fold Wave o'er the brighten'd globe its sacred, conquering gold. IX The sun was slowly sinking to the west, Pavilion'd with a thousand glorious dyes; The turtle-doves were winging to the nest Along the mountain's soft declivities; The fresher breath of flowers began to rise, Like incense, to that sweet departing sun; Faint as the hum of bees the city's cries: A moment, and the lingering disk was gone; Then were the Angel's task on earth's dim orbit done. X Oft had he gazed upon that lovely vale, But never gazed with gladness such as now; When on Damascus' roofs and turrets pale He saw the solemn sunlight's fainter glow, With joy he heard the Imauns' voices flow Like breath of silver trumpets on the air; The vintagers' sweet song, the camels' low, As home they stalk'd from pasture, pair by pair, Flinging their shadows tall in the steep sunset glare. XI Then at his sceptre's wave, a rush of plumes Shook the thick dew-drops from the roses' dyes; And, as embodying of their waked perfumes, A crowd of lovely forms, with lightning eyes, And flower-crown'd hair, and cheeks of Paradise, Circled the bower of beauty on the wing; And all the grove was rich with symphonies Of seeming flute, and horn, and golden string, That slowly rose, and o'er the Mount hung hovering. XII The Angel's flashing eyes were on the vault, That now with lamps of diamond all was hung; His mighty wings like tissues heavenly-wrought, Upon the bosom of the air were hung. The solemn hymn's last harmonies were sung, The sun was couching on the distant zone. “Farewell” was breathing on the Angel's tongue;— He glanced below. There stood a suppliant one! The impatient Angel sank, in wrath, upon his throne. XIII Yet all was quickly sooth'd,—“this labour past, “His coronet of tenfold light was won.” His glance again upon the form was cast, That now seem'd dying on the dazzling stone; He bade it rise and speak. The solemn tone Of Earth's high Sovereign mingled joy with fear, As summer vales of rose by lightning shown; As the night-fountain in the desert drear; His voice seem'd sudden life to that fall'n suppliant's ear. XIV The form arose—the face was in a veil, The voice was low, and often check'd with sighs; The tale it utter'd was a simple tale; “A vow to close a dying parent's eyes, Had brought its weary steps from Tripolis; The Arab in the Syrian mountains lay, The caravan was made the robber's prize, The pilgrim's little wealth was swept away, Man's help was vain.” Here sank the voice in soft decay. XV “And this is Earth!” the Angel frowning said; And from the ground he took a matchless gem, And flung it to the mourner, then outspread His pinions, like the lightning's rushing beam. The pilgrim started at the diamond's gleam, Glanced up in prayer, then, bending near the throne, Shed the quick tears that from the bosom stream, And tried to speak, but tears were there alone; The pitying Angel said, “Be happy and begone.” XVI The weeper raised the veil; a ruby lip First dawn'd: then glow'd the young cheek's deeper hue, Yet delicate as roses when they dip Their odorous blossoms in the morning dew. Then beam'd the eyes, twin stars of living blue; Half shaded by the curls of glossy hair, That turn'd to golden as the light wind threw Their clusters in the western golden glare. Yet was her blue eye dim, for tears were standing there. XVII He look'd upon her, and her hurried gaze Sought from his glance sweet refuge on the ground; But o'er her cheek of beauty rush'd a blaze; And, as the soul had felt some sudden wound, Her bosom heaved above its silken bound. He looked again; the cheek was deadly pale; The bosom sank with one long sigh profound; Yet still one lily hand upheld her veil, And still one press'd her heart—that sigh told all its tale. XVIII She stoop'd, and from the thicket pluck'd a flower, And fondly kiss'd, and then with feeble hand She laid it on the footstool of the bower; Such was the ancient custom of the land. Her sighs were richer than the rose they fann'd; The breezes swept it to the Angel's feet; Yet even that sweet slight boon, 'twas Heaven's command, He must not touch, from her though doubly sweet, No earthly gift must stain that hallow'd judgment-seat. XIX Still lay the flower upon the splendid spot, The Pilgrim turn'd away, as smote with shame; Her eye a glance of self-upbraiding shot; 'Twas in his soul, a shaft of living flame. Then bow'd the humbled one, and bless'd his name, Cross'd her white arms, and slowly bade farewell. A sudden faintness o'er the Angel came; The voice rose sweet and solemn as a spell, She bow'd her face to earth, and o'er it dropp'd her veil. XX Beauty, what art thou, that thy slightest gaze Can make the spirit from its centre roll; Its whole long course, a sad and shadowy maze? Thou midnight or thou noontide of the soul; One glorious vision lighting up the whole Of the wide world; or one deep, wild desire, By day and night consuming, sad and sole; Till Hope, Pride, Genius, nay, till Love's own fire, Desert the weary heart, a cold and mouldering pyre. XXI Enchanted sleep, yet full of deadly dreams; Companionship divine, stern solitude; Thou serpent, colour'd with the brightest gleams That e'er hid poison, making hearts thy food; Woe to the heart that lets thee once intrude, Victim of visions that life's purpose steal, Till the whole struggling nature lies subdued, Bleeding with wounds the grave alone must heal. Proud Angel, was it thine that mortal woe to feel? XXII Still knelt the pilgrim cover'd with her veil, But all her beauty living on his eye; Still hyacinth the clustering ringlets fell Wreathing her forehead's polish'd ivory; Her cheek unseen still wore the rose-bud's dye; She sigh'd; he heard the sigh beside him swell, He glanced around—no Spirit hover'd nigh— Touch'd the fall'n flower, and blushing, sigh'd “farewell.” What sound has stunn'd his ear? A sudden thunder-peal. XXIII He look'd on heaven, 'twas calm, but in the vale A creeping mist had girt the mountain round, Making the golden minarets glimmer pale; It scaled the mount,—the feeble day was drown'd. The sky was with its livid hue embrown'd, But soon the vapours grew a circling sea, Reflecting lovely from its blue profound Mountain, and crimson cloud, and blossom'd tree; Another heaven and earth in bright tranquillity. XXIV And on its bosom swam a small chaloupe, That like a wild swan sported on the tide. The silken sail that canopied its poop Show'd one that look'd an Houri in her pride; Anon came spurring up the mountain's side A warrior Moslem all in glittering mail, That to his country's doubtful battle hied. He saw the form, he heard the tempter's tale, And answered with his own: for beauty will prevail. XXV But now in storm uprose the vast mirage; Where sits she now who tempted him to roam? How shall the skiff with that wild sea engage! In vain the quivering helm is turn'd to home. Dark'ning above the piles of tumbling foam, Rushes a shape of woe, and through the roar Peals in the warrior's ear a voice of doom. Down plunges the chaloupe.—The storm is o'er. Heavy and slow the corpse rolls onward to the shore. XXVI The Angel's heart was smote—but that touch'd flower, Now opening, breathed such fragrance subtly sweet, He felt it strangely chain him to the bower. He dared not then that pilgrim's eye to meet, But gazed upon the small unsandal'd feet Shining like silver on the floor of rose; At length he raised his glance;—the veil's light net Had floated backward from her pencil'd brows, Her eye was fix'd on Heaven, in sad, sublime repose. XXVII A simple Syrian lyre was on her breast, And on her crimson lip was murmuring A village strain, that in the day's sweet rest Is heard in Araby round many a spring, When down the twilight vales the maidens bring The flocks to some old patriarchal well; Or where beneath the palms some desert-king Lies, with his tribe around him as they fell! The thunder burst again; a long, deep, crashing peal. XXVIII The Angel heard it not; as round the range Of the blue hill-tops roar'd the volley on, Uttering its voice with wild, aerial change; Now sinking in a deep and distant moan, Like the last echo of a host o'erthrown; Then rushing with new vengeance down again, Shooting the fiery flash and thunder-stone; Till flamed, like funeral pyres, the mountain chain. The Angel heard it not; its wisdom all was vain. XXIX He heard not even the strain, though it had changed From the calm sweetness of the holy hymn. His thoughts from depth to depth unconscious ranged, Yet all within was dizzy, strange, and dim; A mist seem'd spreading between heaven and him; He sat absorb'd in dreams;—a searching tone Came on his ear, oh how her dark eyes swim Who breathed that echo of a heart undone, The song of early joys, delicious, dear, and gone! XXX Again it changed.—But, now 'twas wild and grand, The praise of hearts that scorn the world's control, Disdaining all but Love's delicious band, The chain of gold and flowers, the tie of soul. Again strange paleness o'er her beauty stole, She glanced above, then stoop'd her glowing eye, Blue as the star that glitter'd by the pole; One tear-drop gleam'd, she dash'd it quickly by, And dropp'd the lyre, and turn'd—as if she turn'd to die. XXXI The night-breeze from the mountains had begun; And as it wing'd among the clouds of even, Where, like a routed king, the Sultan Sun Still struggled on the fiery verge of heaven; Their volumes in ten thousand shapes were driven; Spreading away in boundless palace halls, Whose lights from gold and emerald lamps were given; Or airy citadels and battled walls; Or sunk in valleys sweet, with silver waterfalls. XXXII But, for those sights of heaven the Angel's heart Was all unsettled: and a bitter sigh Burst from his burning lip, and with a start He cast upon the earth his conscious eye. The whole horizon from that summit high Spread out in vision, from the pallid line Where old Palmyra's pomps in ruin lie, Gilding the Arab sands, to where supine The western lustre tinged thy spires, lost Palestine! XXXIII Yet, loveliest of the vision was the vale That sloped beneath his own imperial bowers; Sheeted with colours like an Indian mail, A tapestry sweet of all sun-painted flowers, Balsam, and clove, and jasmines scented showers, And the red glory of the Persian rose, Spreading in league on league around the towers, Where, loved of Heaven, and hated of its foes, The Queen of Cities shines, in calm and proud repose. XXXIV And still he gazed—and saw not that the eve Was fading into night. A sudden thought Struck to his dreaming heart, that made it heave; Was he not there in Paradise?—that spot, Was it not lovely as the lofty vault That rose above him? In his native skies, Could he be happy till his soul forgot, Oh! how forget, the being whom his eyes Loved as their light of light? He heard a tempest rise— XXXV Was it a dream? the vale at once was bare, And o'er it hung a broad and sulphurous cloud: The soil grew red and rifted with its glare; Down to their roots the mountain cedars bow'd; Along the ground a rapid vapour flow'd, Yellow and pale, thick seam'd with streaks of flame. Before it sprang the vulture from the shroud; The lion bounded from it scared and tame; Behind it, dark'ning heaven, the mighty whirlwind came. XXXVI Like a long tulip bed, across the plain A caravan approach'd the evening well, A long, deep mass of turban, plume, and vane; And lovely came its distant, solemn swell Of song, and pilgrim-horn, and camel-bell. The sandy ocean rose before their eye, In thunder on their bending host it fell Ten thousand lips sent up one fearful cry; The sound was still'd at once, beneath its wave they lie. XXXVII But, two escaped, that up the mountain sprung, And those the dead men's treasure downwards drew; One, with slow steps; but beautiful and young Was she, who round his neck her white arms threw. Away the tomb of sand like vapour flew. There, naked lay the costly caravan, A league of piles of silk and gems that threw A rainbow light, and mid them stiff and wan, Stretch'd by his camel's flank, their transient master, man. XXXVIII The statelier wand'rer from the height was won, And cap and sash soon gleam'd with plunder'd gold. But, now the Desert rose, in pillars dun, Glowing with fire like iron in the mould, That wings with fiery speed, recoil'd, sprang, roll'd; Before them waned the moon's ascending phase, The clouds above them shrank the redd'ning fold: On rush'd the giant columns blaze on blaze, The sacrilegious died, wrapp'd in the burning haze. XXXIX The Angel sat enthroned within a dome Of alabaster raised on pillars slight, Curtain'd with tissues of no earthly loom; For spirits wove the web of blossoms bright, Woof of all flowers that drink the morning light, And with their beauty figured all the stone In characters of mystery and might, A more than mortal guard around the throne, That in their tender shade one glorious diamond shone. XL And every bud round pedestal and plinth, As fell the evening, turn'd a living gem. Lighted its purple lamp the hyacinth, The dahlia pour'd its thousand-colour'd gleam, A ruby torch the wond'ring eye might deem Hung on the brow of some night-watching tower, Where upwards climb'd the broad magnolia's stem. An urn of lovely lustre every flower, Burning before the king of that illumined bower. XLI And nestling in that arbour's leafy twine, From cedar's top to violet's lowly bell, Were birds, now hush'd, of plumage all divine, That, as the quivering radiance on them fell, Shot back such hues as stain the orient shell, Touching the deep, green shades with light from eyes Jacinth, and jet, and blazing carbuncle, And gold-dropt coronets, and wings of dyes Bathed in the living streams of their own Paradise. XLII The Angel knew the warning of that storm; But saw the shudd'ring Minstrel's step draw near, And felt the whole deep witchery of her form; Her sigh was music's echo to his ear; He loved—and what has love to do with fear? Now night had droop'd on earth her raven wing, But in the arbour all was splendour clear; And, like twin spirits in its charmed ring, Shone that sweet child of earth and that star-diadem'd king. XLIII For, whether 'twas the light's unusual glow, Or that some dazzling change had on her come; Her look, though lovely still, was loftier now, Her tender cheek was flush'd with brighter bloom; Yet in her azure eyebeam gather'd gloom, Like evening's clouds across its own blue star, Then would a sudden flash its depths illume; And wore she but the wing and gemm'd tiar, She seem'd instinct with might to make the clouds her car. XLIV She slowly raised her arm, that, bright as snow, Gleam'd like a rising meteor through the air, Shedding white lustre on her turban'd brow; And gazed on heaven, as wrapt in solemn prayer; She still look'd woman, yet more proudly fair; And as she stood and pointed to the sky, With that fix'd look of loveliness and care, The Angel thought, and check'd it with a sigh, He saw some Spirit fallen from immortality. XLV The silent prayer was done; and now she moved Faint to his footstool, and, upon her knee, Besought her lord, if in his heaven they loved, That, as she never more his face must see, She there might pledge her heart's fidelity. Then turn'd, and pluck'd a cluster from the vine, And o'er a chalice waved it, with a sigh, Then stoop'd the crystal cup before the shrine. In wrath the Angel rose—the guilty draught was wine! XLVI She stood; she shrank; she totter'd. Down he sprang, Clasp'd with one hand her waist, with one upheld The vase—his ears with giddy murmurs rang; His eye upon her dying cheek was spell'd; Up to the brim the draught of evil swell'd Like liquid rose, its odour touch'd his brain; He knew his ruin, but his soul was quell'd; He shudder'd—gazed upon her cheek again, Press'd her pale lip, and to the last that cup did drain. XLVII Th'enchantress smiled, as still in some sweet dream, Then waken'd in a long, delicious sigh, And on the bending Spirit fix'd the beam Of her deep, dewy, melancholy eye. The undone Angel gave no more reply Than hiding his pale forehead in the hair That floated on her neck of ivory, And breathless pressing, with her ringlets fair, From his bright eyes the tears of passion and despair. XLVIII The heaven was one blue cope, inlaid with gems Thick as the concave of a diamond mine, But from the north now fly pale, phosphor beams, That o'er the mount their quivering net entwine; The smallest stars through that sweet lustre shine; Then, like a routed host, its streamers fly: Then, from the moony horizontal line A surge of sudden glory floods the sky, Ocean of purple waves, and melted lazuli. XLIX But wilder wonder smote their shrinking eyes: A vapour plunged upon the vale from heaven, Then, darkly gathering, tower'd of mountain size; From its high crater column'd smokes were driven; It heaved within, as if pent flames had striven With mighty winds to burst their prison hold, Till all the cloud-volcano's bulk was riven With angry light, that seem'd in cataracts roll'd, Silver, and sanguine steel, and streams of molten gold. L Then echoed on the winds a hollow roar, An Earthquake groan, that told convulsion near: Out rush'd the burthen of its burning core, Myriads of fiery globes, as day-light clear. The sky was fill'd with flashing sphere on sphere, Shooting straight upward to the zenith's crown. The stars were blasted in that splendour drear, The land beneath in wild distinctness shone, From Syria's yellow sands to Libanus' summit-stone. LI The storm is on the embattled clouds receding, The purple streamers wander pale and thin, But o'er the pole a fiercer flame is spreading, Wheel within wheel of fire, and far within Revolves a stooping splendour crystalline. A throne;—but who the sitter on that throne! The Angel knew the punisher of sin. Check'd on his lip the self-upbraiding groan, And clasp'd his dying love, and joy'd to be undone. LII And once, 'twas but a moment, on her cheek He gave a glance, then sank his hurried eye, And press'd it closer on her dazzling neck. Yet, even in that swift gaze, he could espy A look that made his heart's blood backwards fly. Was it a dream? there echoed in his ear A stinging tone—a laugh of mockery! It was a dream—it must be. Oh! that fear, When the heart longs to know, what it is death to hear. LIII He glanced again—her eye was upward still, Fix'd on the stooping of that burning car; But through his bosom shot an arrowy thrill, To see its solemn, stern, unearthly glare; She stood a statue of sublime despair, But on her lip sat scorn.—His spirit froze,— His footstep reel'd,—his wan lip gasp'd for air; She felt his throb,—and o'er him stoop'd with brows As evening sweet, and kiss'd him with a lip of rose. LIV Again she was all beauty, and they stood Still fonder clasp'd, and gazing with the eye Of famine gazing on the poison'd food That it must feed on, or abstaining die. There was between them now nor tear nor sigh; Theirs was the deep communion of the soul; Passion's absorbing, bitter luxury; What was to them or heaven or earth, the whole Was in that fatal spot, where they stood sad, and sole. LV The Minstrel first shook off the silent trance; And in a voice sweet as the murmuring Of summer streams beneath the moonlight's glance, Besought the desperate one to spread the wing Beyond the power of his vindictive king. Slave to her slightest word, he raised his plume, For life or death, he reck'd not which, to spring; Nay, to confront the thunder and the gloom. She wildly kiss'd his hand, and sank, as in a tomb. LVI The Angel sooth'd her, “No! let Justice wreak Its wrath upon them both, or him alone.” A flush of love's pure crimson lit her cheek; She whisper'd, and his stoop'd ear drank the tone With mad delight; “Oh there is one way, one, To save us both. Are there not mighty words, Graved on the magnet-throne where Solomon Sits ever guarded by the genii swords, To give thy servant wings, like her resplendent Lord's?” LVII This was the sin of sins! The first, last crime, In earth and heaven, unnamed, unnameable; This from his throne of light, before all time, Had smitten Eblis, brightest, first that fell. He started back.—“What urged him to rebel? What led that soft seducer to his bower? Could she have laid upon his soul that spell, Young, lovely, fond; yet but an earthly flower?”— But for that fatal cup, he had been free that hour. LVIII But still its draught was fever in his blood. He caught the upward, humble, weeping gleam Of woman's eye, by passion all subdued; He sigh'd, and at his sigh he saw it beam: Oh! the sweet frenzy of the lover's dream! A moment's lingering, and they both must die. The lightning round them shot a broader stream; He felt her clasp his feet in agony; He spoke the “Words of might”,—the thunder gave reply! LIX Away! away! the sky is one black cloud, Shooting its lightnings down in spire on spire. Around the mount its canopy is bow'd, A fiery vault upraised on pillar'd fire; The stars like lamps along its roof expire; But through its centre bursts an orb of rays; The Angel knew the Avenger in his ire! The hill-top smoked beneath the stooping blaze, The culprits dared not there their guilty glances raise. LX And words were utter'd from that whirling sphere, That mortal sense might never hear and live. They pierced like arrows through the Angel's ear; He bow'd his head; 'twas vain to fly or strive. Down comes the final wrath: the thunders give The doubled peal,—the rains in cataracts sweep, Broad bars of fire the sheeted deluge rive; The mountain summits to the valley leap, Pavilion, garden, grove, smoke up one ruin'd heap. LXI The storm stands still! a moment's pause of terror! All dungeon-dark!—Again the lightnings yawn, Shewing the earth as in a quivering mirror. The prostrate Angel felt but that the one, Whose love had lost him Paradise, was gone: He dared not see her corpse!—he closed his eyes; A voice burst o'er him, solemn as the tone Of the last trump,—he glanced upon the skies, He saw, what shook his soul with terror, shame, surprise. LXII The Minstrel stood before him; two broad plumes Spread from her shoulders on the burthen'd air; Her face was glorious still, but love's young blooms Had vanish'd for the hue of bold despair; A fiery circle crown'd her sable hair; And, as she look'd upon her prostrate prize, Her eyeballs shot around a meteor glare, Her form tower'd up at once to giant size; 'Twas Eblis! king of Hell's relentless sovereignties. LXIII The tempter spoke—“Spirit, thou mightst have stood, But thou hast fall'n a weak and willing slave. Now were thy feeble heart our serpents' food, Thy bed our burning ocean's sleepless wave, But haughty Heaven controls the power it gave. Yet art thou doom'd to wander from thy sphere, Till the last trumpet reaches to the grave; Till the Sun rolls the grand concluding year; Till Earth is Paradise; then shall thy crime be clear.” LXIV The Angel listen'd,—risen upon one knee, Resolved to hear the deadliest undismay'd. His star-dropt plume hung round him droopingly, His brow, like marble, on his hand was staid. Still through the auburn locks' o'er hanging shade His face shone beautiful; he heard his ban; Then came the words of mercy, sternly said; He plunged within his hands his visage wan, And the first wild, sweet tears from his heart-pulses ran. LXV The Giant grasp'd him as he fell to earth, And his black vanes upon the air were flung, A tabernacle dark;—and shouts of mirth Mingled with shriekings through the tempest swung; His arm around the fainting Angel clung. Then on the clouds he darted with a groan; A moment o'er the mount of ruin hung, Then burst through space, like the red comet's cone, Leaving his track on heaven a burning, endless zone. THE END. ON THE GRAVE OF MAJOR SCHILL, BURIED ON THE GLACIS OF STRALSUND. Schill was one of those bold spirits who, in the days of German degradation, sustained the ancient memory of their country's valour. After the battle of Jena, he burst from Berlin, with his own regiment of hussars; and at their head, with a few volunteers, kept the French communications in alarm, taking Marshal Victor, and scouring the country up to the Baltic. He was finally attacked by a superior force in Stralsund, and, after a desperate struggle, slain. STRANGER. German soldier, is thy tear Shed on a felon's sepulchre? What can shelter in that heap, But some guilty outcast's sleep?— Yet, many a footstep freshly round Marks it, like loved and holy ground. SOLDIER. Stranger! this heap is all the grave Of one who died, as die the brave! And never bosom's nobler tide Stain'd flood or field, than when he died. Stranger! no stone might dare to tell His name, who on this red spot fell. These steps are steps of German men, Who, when the tyrant's in his den, Come nightly here with solemn tread, To vow their vengeance o'er the dead. Dead!—No! that spirit's light'ning still! Stranger! thou seest the grave of Schill. ON THE DEATH OF ORPHEUS. FROM THE GREEK OF ANTIPATER. “??? ??? ??????????, ?????,” ?. ?. ?. Orpheus! thou no more shalt lead, From the mountain's bending head, Ancient rocks and forests gray, Nor make the brinded lion play, And the spotted leopard crouch Beside thy high-retired couch; While the eagle check'd its wing, Charm'd above thy solemn string. Thou no more the snow shalt bind, Or the biting Thracian wind: Nor subdue the stormy cloud, Hoary Winter's chilling shroud; Nor, with an enchanted strain, On old Ocean fling a chain. Many a tear was shed for thee! The divine Calliope, In wild beauty, through the woods, Where the yellow autumn broods, Wept and wander'd for thee long; In their caves the Satyr throng, Grieving, stamp'd with horny tread On the sweet, uneven reed; And every Dryad from her tree Fill'd the air with wo for thee. Thou'rt gone! Shall mortals o'er the grave repine, When thus a goddess mourns a son divine! SANDT, THE MURDERER. Sandt was a student in a German University, who, inflamed by the mysticism and extravagance of the half-revolutionary and half-infidel doctrines, which perverted the German youth at the close of the French war, determined to make himself memorable by sacrificing some enemy of his country. For this enemy he fixed on Kotzebue, the dramatist, who, from his being known to send letters on the state of the German public mind to the Emperor Alexander, had rendered himself suspected by the partizans of the Tugendbund. Sandt went to his house, handed him a letter, and while he was looking over it, stabbed him to the heart. He then gave himself some desperate wounds, but was seized before he could thus atrociously consummate the double triumph of the new philosophy. After a long imprisonment, he was brought to trial, sentenced, and put to death on the glacis of Manheim. The night was stormy; yet the clang Of hammers through the darkness rang, And on the rampart's vapoury swamp High swung one faint and fitful lamp, And came upon the gusty swell The challenge of the sentinel; As if some deed were doing there Unfit for man to see or hear. Morn rose on twilight, dim and slow; By Manheim's gates were signs of woe— A scaffold hung with black, a chair, A sable bench,—a sabre bare, Show'd, that before the setting sun Some wretch's chain should be undone. The gates roll back, and from the wall Come chargers' tramp, and trumpet's call: And, in the horsemen's midst, the dawn Gleams on a face lone, wild, and wan; The dazzled eye, the lip of blue, Tell that to them the light is new; Tell of the chain, the heavy air, That damps the felon's sleepless lair. The hand;—that pale, thin hand, which now So feebly wanders o'er the brow, By that was murder done; the stain That left the hand, has dyed the brain. The troops have reach'd the fatal stair, The headsman stands beside the chair; The pale, uncover'd multitude Are hush'd as death; now—blood for blood! High Heaven! what burning thoughts must roll Through man beside that fearful goal? Conscience has started from her sleep; Now, man of sin! thy harvest reap. He sees a traitor's step intrude Upon an old man's solitude; He sees the dagger in his heart,— The writhe, ere soul and body part,— The gasp, the dying gush of gore:— The murderer dares to think no more, Curses the moment's frantic zeal, And hurries to the headsman's steel. Yet, when beneath the rising sun His native mountains lovely shone; He raised one eastward, eager glare, Wildly inhaled the living air, On sun and sky his eyeball cast, Like one who on them look'd his last; Gave to the world one dreary sigh, Then summon'd his sad strength to die. The sword flash'd round, the red blood sprang, To heaven arose the trumpet-clang,— And of the murderer, all that lay Upon that floor was blood and clay. GEMS, FROM THE ANTIQUE;THE ETCHINGS BY R.

Finished designs of gems are seldom found in the greater collections; for no excellence of the engraver can satisfy the eye of the antiquary—and true taste will prefer an accurate indication, to the studied and finished copying of forms, whose delicacy and sweetness are beyond all power of the burin. “Here from the mould to conscious being start Those finer forms, the miracles of art; Here chosen Gems, imprest on sulphur, shine, That slept for ages in a second mine.” ROGERS. PERICLES AND ASPASIA. This was the ruler of the land, When Athens was the land of fame; This was the light that led the band, When each was like a living flame: The centre of earth's noblest ring, Of more than men, the more than king! Yet, not by fetter, nor by spear, His sovereignty was held or won; Fear'd—but alone as freemen fear; Loved—but as freemen love alone: He waved the sceptre o'er his kind, By Nature's first great title—mind! Resistless words were on his tongue; Then eloquence first flash'd below! Full arm'd to life the portent sprung, Minerva, from the Thunderer's brow! And his the sole, the sacred hand, That shook her ægis o'er the land! And throned immortal, by his side, A woman sits, with eye sublime— Aspasia, all his spirit's bride; But if their solemn love were crime, Pity the beauty and the sage; Their crime was in their darken'd age. He perish'd—but his wreath was won— He perish'd on his height of fame! Then sank the cloud on Athens' sun; Yet still she conquer'd in his name. Fill'd with his soul, she could not die; Her conquest was Posterity! THE GENIUS OF DEATH. What is Death? 'Tis to be free! No more to love, or hope, or fear— To join the great equality: All alike are humbled there! The mighty grave Wraps lord and slave; Nor pride nor poverty dares come Within that refuge-house, the tomb! Spirit with the drooping wing, And the ever-weeping eye, Thou of all earth's kings art king! Empires at thy footstool lie! Beneath thee strew'd Their multitude Sink, like waves upon the shore; Storms shall never rouse them more! What's the grandeur of the earth To the grandeur round thy throne! Riches, glory, beauty, birth, To thy kingdom all have gone. Before thee stand The wond'rous band; Bards, heroes, sages, side by side, Who darken'd nations when they died! Earth has hosts; but thou canst show Many a million for her one; Through thy gates the mortal flow Has for countless years roll'd on: Back from the tomb No step has come; There fix'd, till the last thunder's sound Shall bid thy prisoners be unbound! A WOMAN CONTEMPLATING A HOUSEHOLD GOD. Domestic Love! not in proud palace halls Is often seen thy beauty to abide; Thy dwelling is in lowly cottage walls, That in the thickets of the woodbine hide; With hum of bees around, and from the side Of woody hills some little bubbling spring, Shining along through banks with harebells dyed; And many a bird to warble on the wing, When Morn her saffron robe o'er heaven and earth doth fling. O! love of loves!—to thy white hand is given Of earthly happiness the golden key! Thine are the joyous hours of winter's even, When the babes cling around their father's knee; And thine the voice, that on the midnight sea Melts the rude mariner with thoughts of home, Peopling the gloom with all he longs to see. Spirit! I've built a shrine; and thou hast come, And on its altar closed—for ever closed thy plume! LEONIDAS. Shout for the mighty men Who died along this shore— Who died within this mountain glen! For never nobler chieftain's head Was laid on Valour's crimson bed, Nor ever prouder gore Sprang forth, than theirs who won the day Upon thy strand, Thermopylæ! Shout for the mighty men, Who on the Persian tents, Like lions from their midnight den, Bounding on the slumbering deer, Rush'd—a storm of sword and spear;— Like the roused elements, Let loose from an immortal hand, To chasten or to crush a land! But there are none to hear; Greece is a hopeless slave. Leonidas! no hand is near To lift thy fiery falchion now; No warrior makes the warrior's vow Upon thy sea-wash'd grave. The voice that should be raised by men, Must now be given by wave and glen. And it is given!—the surge— The tree—the rock—the sand— On Freedom's kneeling spirit urge, In sounds that speak but to the free, The memory of thine and thee! The vision of thy band Still gleams within the glorious dell, Where their gore hallow'd, as it fell! And is thy grandeur done? Mother of men like these! Has not thy outcry gone, Where Justice has an ear to hear?— Be holy! God shall guide thy spear; Till in thy crimson'd seas, Are plunged the chain and scimitar, Greece shall be a new-born Star! CASTOR AND POLLUX. When Winter dips his pinion in the seas, And mariners shudder, as the chilling gale Makes its wild music through the Cyclades; What eyes are fix'd upon the cloudy veil, Twin Warriors! to behold your sapphire mail, Shooting its splendours through the rifted sky! What joyous hymns your stars of beauty hail! For then the tempests to their caverns fly, And on the pebbled shore the yellow surges die. CUPID BREAKING THE THUNDERBOLT. Where is, O Love! thy nest? Is it in Beauty's breast, Or in the meshes of her chestnut hair? Or do thine arrows fly, Wing'd from her azure eye, Or from her coral lip's delicious air. O love! 'tis all the same; For thy subduing flame, Alike by sunny tress and sigh is fann'd; And hearts, in all their pride, Have in sweet passion died, Ev'n at the faint touch of her snowy hand. Sceptres are weak to thee, Thou thing of infancy! Thy childish wrath can break the bolts of Jove. Yet deadlier is thy smile, The spirit to beguile, Making the tomb the bride-bed—faithless Love! A FAUN. Shadow me, woods! and let your branches wave, Making sweet music to my drowsy ear: Be dim, fair moon! and through the leafy roof Seem but a twinkling lamp; and every breeze Die on your flowery beds, until my eyes Yield to this pleasant heaviness! And hark! There is a gentle music in the air! The moon is but a lamp, and the rude wind Has died upon the rose!—Come, gentle dream! This is Elysium! All the grove is fill'd With sights and sounds of wonder:—There's no tree, But opening lets a goddess forth; the streams Send up bright shapes, that from their lilied hair Wring out the sparkling waters; all the hills Are starr'd with silver fires; the marble caves Show through their ivy curtains sylvan lamps, Lit by the glow-worm's torch; and airy songs Bewitch the night. This is the woodland King! And here upon his lonely throne he sits, Entranced, with his sweet pipe fix'd at his foot, And listens to the revelry,—till Morn, Led by the gray-hair'd Twilight from her couch, Comes, like a blushing bride, to meet the Sun! CUPID CARRYING PROVISIONS. A.D. 1600. There was once a gentle time Whenne the world was in its prime; And everie day was holydaye, And everie monthe was lovelie Maye.— Cupide thenne hadde but to goe With his purple winges and bowe; And in blossomede vale and grove Everie shepherde knelte to Love. Thenne a rosie, dimplede cheeke, And a blue eye fonde and meeke; And a ringlette-wreathenne browe, Like hyacynthes on a bed of snowe; And a lowe voice silverre sweete From a lippe without deceite: Onlie those the heartes coulde move Of the simple swaines to love. But thatte time is gone and paste; Canne the summerre alwayes laste! And the swaines are wiser growne, And the hearte is turnede to stone, And the maidenne's rose may witherre, Cupide's fled, no manne knowes whitherre! But anotherre Cupide's come, With a browe of care and gloome; Fixede upon the earthlie moulde, Thinkinge of the sullenne golde: In his hande the bowe no more, At his backe the householde store, That the bridalle colde muste buye; Uselesse nowe the smile ande sighe: But he weares the pinion stille, Flyinge at the sighte of ille. Oh, for the olde true-love time, Whenne the worlde was in its prime! SAPPHO. Look on this brow!—the laurel wreath Beam'd on it, like a wreath of fire; For passion gave the living breath, That shook the chords of Sappho's lyre! Look on this brow—the lowest slave, The veriest wretch of want and care, Might shudder at the lot that gave Her genius, glory, and despair. For, from these lips were utter'd sighs, That more than fever, scorch'd the frame; And tears were rain'd from these bright eyes, That from the heart, like life-blood, came. She loved—she felt the lightning-gleam, That keenest strikes the loftiest mind; Life quench'd in one ecstatic dream, The world a waste before—behind. And she had hope—the treacherous hope, The last, deep poison of the bowl, That makes us drain it, drop by drop, Nor lose one misery of soul. Then all gave way—mind, passion, pride! She cast one weeping glance above, And buried in her bed, the tide, The whole concentred strife of Love! DIANA. How like a Queen comes forth the lonely Moon From the slow-opening curtains of the clouds, Walking in beauty to her midnight throne! The stars are veil'd in light; the ocean-floods, And the ten thousand streams—the boundless woods, The trackless wilderness—the mountain's brow, Where Winter on eternal pinions broods— All height, depth, wildness, grandeur, gloom, below, Touch'd by thy smile, lone Moon! in one wide splendour glow. GENIUS BOUND. Glorious Spirit! at whose birth Joy might fill the conscious earth; Yet her joy be dash'd with fear, As at untold danger near; A comet rising on her gloom, Or to light her, or consume! Beauty is upon thy brow! Such sad beauty as the bow, Child of shower and sunbeam, wears, Waked, and vanishing, in tears; Yet to its splendid moment given Colours only lit by heaven. Thou canst take the lightning's wings, And see the deep forbidden things;— With thy starry sandal tread On the ocean's treasure bed; Or make the rolling clouds thy throne; Height and depth to thee are one! Prophet Spirit! thou canst sweep Where the unborn nations sleep; Or, from the ancient ages' shroud To judgement call their sceptred crowd; Earth has to thee nor birth, nor tomb— Nor past, nor present, nor to come. Yet here thou sit'st, while earth and heaven Are to thy radiant empire given. Alas! I see the manacle!— And all thy soul has felt the steel; Thy wing of fire, thy beauty, vain— For Genius dies beneath the chain! BACCHUS ON A PANTHER. Boy of beauty rare! With thy lip in roses dyed, And that harmless, infant air, Why upon the panther ride, Boy of beauty rare? Sweet one! is't to tell That within thy cup is woe! That the victim of thy spell Passion's fiery speed shall know?— Thou'rt an oracle! THESEUS. When Theseus left his Ariadne's side, Young Bacchus came—at once her tears were dried. Our widows, hence, disdain in weeds to pine, But take another husband with their wine! A TRITON AND NEREID. The day had been a tempest, and our bark, Ploughing the surly and impetuous surge, Had reach'd a bay in Crete. The evening fell, Leaving the sky all painted with bright clouds, That dyed their crimson on the glassy sea. So, having moor'd, we lay, like men escaped, Idly upon the poop and deck, in talk, Such as the wanderer loves, of fearful wrecks; Of night surprises, where the slumbering crew Were woke by pirate swords; of buried gold In the sea-chambers; of the warnings sweet, That come o' nights between the stormy gusts, The mermaids' melodies. At once uprose A tumult of rich sounds, as if the deep Were cleft to let them forth: then died as swift, Leaving us breathless, gazing all perplex'd, Like spell-struck creatures!—But, anon, the wave Was fill'd with wonders, wild and green-hair'd men, With conchs for trumpets, follow'd by fair nymphs, That show'd their ivory shoulders through the tide; Some, tossing spears of coral, some, pearl-crown'd, And scattering roses—or, with lifted hands, Reining the purple lips of dolphins yoked, And huge sea-horses. While we stood amazed; A meteor shot above, the trumpets swell'd, And on a sweeping and high-crested surge, That stoop'd our pennant to its foaming edge, Rush'd by two sovereign Shapes, hand twined in hand, In speechless love!—The waves around were swum By crowding Cupids, Tritons, and sweet Nymphs Filling the perfumed air with harmony. The pageant flash'd away, and left us dim, Like men who had seen lightning! ATALANTA. When the young Greek for Atalanta sigh'd, He might have fool'd and follow'd, till he died! He learn'd the sex, the bribe before her roll'd, And found, the short way to the heart is—Gold! SILENUS LOOKING AT A GOBLET. Where is the Necromancer? Let him bring His treasury of charms—rich syrups—herbs Gather'd in eclipse, or where shooting stars Sow earth with pearl: or let him call his sprites, Till the air thickens, and the golden noon, Smote by their wings, is turn'd to sudden night. This goblet's worth all magic. Of its draught Let sorrow taste, anon, the lifeless lip Glows crimson; sullen Poverty is rich; The bondsman's chain is light as gossamer; The lover's eye, long dim with wasting tears, Shines brightly, and sees kneeling for a look The tyrant Beauty; Age is warm'd to Youth; Lean Avarice hoards no more; and crouching Fear Stalks giant-like: the fretted brows of kings Forget the feverish pressure of a crown, And taste as pleasant slumber as the slave's, That toils for't in the sun. VENUS CLIPPING THE WINGS OF CUPID. Venus, clippe thy truante's winge:— For it is the deadliest thinge 'Twixte the rounde earthe and the skie. Not the poisonne-staines that lie Glisteninge in the waninge moone, On the slipperie serpente stone; Not the droppe of venome hunge Coldlie from the aspic's tongue; Not the witche's eville eye, As she hurries mutteringe bye; Nothinge born of sunne or gloome, Is so deadlie as thatte plume! For the hearte's no sooner wonne, Than the truante Love is gone; Fickle as the Aprille gale. Then the maidene's cheeke is pale; And the vermeile-tincturede lippe, Riche as rosebuddes when they dippe In the summerre honeye-dewe, Dyinge, weares the lilye's hue; Ande, for smiles, the wearie sighe On its beautie nowe dothe lie; Ande the farewelle worde is spokenne— Ande the maidene's heart is brokenne! FLORA. The flowers are Nature's jewels, with whose wealth She decks her summer beauty;—Primrose sweet, With blossoms of pure gold; enchanting Rose, That like a virgin queen, salutes the Sun, Dew-diadem'd; the perfumed Pink, that studs The earth with clustering ruby; Hyacinth, The hue of Venus' tresses;—Myrtle green, That maidens think a charm for constant love, And give night-kisses to it, and so dream; Fair Lilly! woman's emblem, and oft twined Round bosoms, where its silver is unseen, Such is their whiteness;—downcast Violet, Turning away its sweet head from the wind, As she her delicate and startled ear From passion's tale! THE EDUCATION OF BACCHUS. I had a vision!—'Twas an Indian vale, Whose sides were all with rosy thickets crown'd, That never felt the biting winter gale;— And soon was heard a most delicious sound; And to its music danced a nymph embrown'd, Leading a lion in a silken twine, That with his yellow mane would sweep the ground, Then on his rider fawn—a boy divine! While on his foaming lips a nymph shower'd purple wine. PINDAR. In the grave this head was laid;— All its atoms in the sun Through a thousand years have play'd, Through a thousand shapes have gone: It has blossom'd in the flower— It has floated in the wave— It has lit the starlight hour— It has whisper'd through the cave! Has the spirit perish'd all? This was but its mouldering wall! Fame, the prize of life, was won; Pindar's mighty task was done; Then on air his wing was cast! Like a flame, the soul has past, While the ashes rest below;— Like a trumpet's sudden blast, Gone!—what strength shall check it now? When the lightning wears a chain, Pindar's soul shall stoop again!— Yet the world has need of thee, Man of Immortality: Greece,—the name is lost in tears,— Land of laurels, lyres, and spears! Visions on that spot have birth, Brighter than are born of earth: In that soil of glorious strife, Not an atom but had life. Glow'd and triumph'd, fought and died, As the patriot battle's tide, Flood of arrow, lance, and sword, O'er the whelm'd invader roar'd. Hear us! from thy golden sphere!— Shall the eternal sepulchre Hide the spirit of the land? Shall no great, redeeming hand— (Oh, for such as dyed her seas In thy day, Miltiades!) Issuing from her peasant ranks, Smite the turban'd robber horde, Till the chain no longer clanks,— Till the Turkish battle, gored, Over Helle's purple banks In returnless flight is pour'd;— Till the phalanx, laurel-brow'd, Like a rolling thunder-cloud, Like a conflagration sweeping, Of its plague-spot clears the soil; And no more the voice of weeping, Woman's shame, or manhood's spoil, Grieves the listening midnight sky?— Pindar! shall her glory die! Shall, like thine, no godlike strain Teach her to be great again? Hear us, from thy starry throne Hear!—by those in Marathon! END OF THE GEMS. INSCRIPTION FOR AN ANTIQUE CASKET, CONTAINING A RING. A.D. 1500. From India came this little bande Of emeralde and rubie stone, A spelle that sparklinge on thine hande, Should tell thee gentle tales of one, Whose daye and nighte were memorie, Helene! of loveliness and thee. A spelle was gravenne in its golde, A spirit fixede, without his winges; To Helene once it would have tolde More than was ever tolde by ringes: But now, mie dreame's alle past and gone, Mie teares are on the burial stone! Thou canst not see the teares that starte From eyes by thoughtes like those beguilde, Thou canst not knowe the beatinge hearte, Ever a victime and a childe! To me 'tis left alone to grieve; The tombe, the tombe doth not deceive. I'll heare thy voice of melodie In whispers of the summerre air, I'll see the brightnesse of thine eye In the blue eveninge's shininge starre, In moonlighte beames thy puritie; And look on heavenne, to look on thee! THE BATTLE SONG. FROM THE GREEK OF TYRTÆUS. “?????? ???? ??????????,” ?. ?. ?. Shake off slumber—Men, arise! Dare you meet the scorner's eyes? War is safety, peace is fear, Life is only in the spear. Though ye perish, let the dart Quiver in the slayer's heart! Falling, dying, battle still,— Glory's in the warrior-will! Death must strike us soon or late, 'Tis the stern decree of fate: Heroes, onwards,—press the targe Close to the burning heart, and charge! Push the spear!—Not Jove could save His offspring from the common grave: The coward and the brave must fall, Death smites alike in field and hall. Yet where's the wife's, the people's tear, Upon the flyer's culprit bier? But, if the wound the brave man wring, The people to his threshold cling; He dies—they love the ground he trod; Living, he lives a demi-god! The nation's tower, beloved, adored— An army in his single sword! DEATH. FROM THE GREEK OF AGATHIAS. “??? ??????? ?? ?????????” ?. ?. ?. Why shrink at Death, the end of all our woes— Life's healer—mighty mother of repose? If good, 'tis good for ever; but if ill, It wounds but once, and then the pang is still. Life's wan diseases strike us o'er and o'er; The traveller of death returns no more! THE MAGIC LAMP. “On the cavern's chilling stone Faint with terror, lost, alone; Young Aladdin, dost thou lie, Waiting for thine hour to die?” Rushing in his spell-bound sleep Tens of thousand fathoms deep, What is o'er his shrinking head? Ocean thundering on its bed. What beneath that rocky floor? Gulphs of ever-burning ore? There came a voice, it was strange and sweet As the sounds that on evening waters meet, When the winds on the purpling mountain die, And the sun gives his farewell look to the sky. Is it a dream? He feels his hand Touch'd by the point of a feathery wand, And his dying glance is raised from the stone— Along the roof a radiance shone, A gentle glory, like the line Of the rising crescent argentine, And hovering in its central white, On azure wings, a shape of light. The eye that look'd its ringlets through, Was bright as the stars of the Himmalu, Or the violet flash of the northern sky; And on its ringlets clustering high A coronet shed a steady glow, Like a ring of flame imprison'd in snow. It spoke, and its wings' descending wave With a breath of odours fill'd the cave. “Lord of the talisman of might, That binds to man the sons of light, We heard thee in our airy hall, Above the dog-star's burning ball; And now at our master's summoning, Behold, the Genii of the Ring.” Aladdin knelt, the Moslem's breast Was bow'd, in homage, to the east. A blaze of lightning o'er him shot, And where it struck, a burning spot Still shone upon the granite wall. It waver'd and spread like a fiery pall, Sanguine and more sanguine growing, Till the whole sheet of rock was glowing, In gushes and serpent coils of flame That sear'd his eyes and scorch'd his frame! Woe, woe, to the lord of the talisman. Terror and anguish through him ran; “There must he fall.” He strove to fling From his dying hand the Mystic Ring. The sulphurous flame before him roll'd, But 'twas now like the verdure soft and cold That Spring embroiders for Persian vales, When the moonlight awakes the nightingales. Then rose and fell on his ear a sound, Like music echoing under ground; Sinking and sweet, yet unsubdued, Like the distant song of multitude; Or the wind's melody, when the sun Has his first garland of crimson thrown On the dusky Eastern sea; Or the forest's evening harmony, When every leaf has found a tongue; A swelling, strange, inconstant song. And, crowding through the lunar light, Came glittering shapes, then pass'd from sight: Wing'd spirits, floating in beauty round, To the risings and fallings of that sweet sound. And on the ringlets of each fair brow The circlet of flame imprison'd in snow; Till the chaunt was done, and the train were gone, Dissolving like airs and dews through the stone. Now rose on his sight a Pagoda old, Flourished with sculptures wild and bold; And around it piles of ancient stone Like the tombs of monarchs dead and gone, Cover'd with carpets of giant weeds, And mighty trunks, where the adder breeds. He burst the gate. But his eagle gaze Shrank in the lightning's arrowy rays, That shot from the trees of the palace bower, Thick as the drops of a summer shower. The fruits o'er his head and the flowers at his feet Were living topaz and crysolite, The smallest shrub that shook in the wind Was worth all the pearls of the princes of Ind. But he saw not, he touch'd not, but struggled on, Where his charmed life must be lost or won; Where blazed in the garden's depth the Lamp, Like the central fire of an eastern camp, When the turban'd Rajah and swarthy Khan Prepare for the fight in the midnight divan. The piercing blaze of that lofty light Mark'd the place of mystery and might, Whence the spirits of many an evil Star Shot the shafts of pestilence and war; And Famine's cold breath was blown on the soil, And Death led the Tartar and Curd to the spoil. The blaze of the talisman was sent Through the wavering folds of a boundless tent, That like clouds of amber and orange shone Round the garden's bright, unsetting Sun: For there it had flamed from earth's primal hour, The sun and the soul of king Lucifer's bower. He climbed the hill. A roar of flame Show'd where the lava round him came; A thousand arrows were on the wing, He could hear the twanging of the string; A thousand scimitars cleft the air, Yet they touch'd not one lock of his waving hair. The curtain arose. The Lamp's fierce light Shot gushes of flame on his withering sight; But he press'd the ring, and he saw their fire Shrink, like a wounded dragon's spire. And fiendish curse and loud lament Swell'd from the depths of the genie tent, Mingled with shrieks and battle cries, Women's and warriors' agonies. But still he rush'd on, though from head to heel He felt his startled senses reel. He touch'd the Lamp; down sank the flame— Thunder, and tempest, and midnight came. His senses were gone.—When he gazed again, He was standing beside a fearful den; But o'er his head was the dewy light That heralds the stars of the Persian night; And play'd on his cheek the dewy air, And the dew was cool on his raven hair; And, where the moon, on the mountains lay, He saw rampart and minaret tall and gray. 'Tis his Persian hound that beside him lies, 'Tis his Turcoman steed that beside him neighs, 'Tis Bagdad that sleeps in the silver showers By the moonlight shed on those stately towers. But a chaunt is heard of voice and string— “Aladdin rise, and be more than a king. The Lamp, dominion's master-sign, The Ring of the genie lords, are thine; Yet the warrior-soul the prize that won, Is brighter than Lamp, and Ring, and throne.” NELSON'S PILLAR, AT YARMOUTH. WRITTEN BY THE SEA-SIDE ON A LOWERING EVENING. There is a gloomy grandeur in the sun, That levels his last light along the shore; The clouds are rolling downwards stern and dun; The long, slow wave is streak'd with red, like gore On some vast field of battle; and the roar Of wave and wind comes like the battle's sound. From Ocean's depths a column seems to soar, A shaft of silver, on whose summit, wound With fiery beams, sits Britain sad, and throned, and crown'd! And now the sun sinks deeper; and the clouds, In folds of sullen fire, still heavier lour; 'Till the whole storm the shore and ocean shrouds. But o'er the tempest glows that stately tower, A giant height, on which the sunbeams shower Their undiminish'd glories. Nelson's name Is on the column. Thus the battle's hour But show'd the splendour of his spirit's flame, Thus till earth's final night shall blaze the Hero's fame. THE INDIAN GIRL AND SERPENT. FROM A PICTURE BY STEWARDSON. “Is it a vision? For I've seen such things Among the morning skies, and the sweet fires That play round tree-tops in the setting sun.” The bower is of the Indian drapery That weaves its living woof of flowers and fruits, Red with the kisses of the amorous sun; The roof is canopied crimson of the rose, Vaulting a couch of violet, here and there Tinged with some bud fresh weeping from the roof; And tissued with rich leaves, that force their way Veining the blue, like gold in lazuli. A form is in that bower, that might be thought Placed there for man to worship, or of those That sit on thrones o' the cloud, and wreathe their wings With pearls still wet from dews of Paradise. Yet she is human, and the silvery shawl, That, like a holy circle o'er a saint, Crowns her pale beauty, binds a weary brow, Besieged with memories that make it pale. She sits upon the ground; and one hand lifts A flute, that from her lip draws melodies, Like the wind's wooing of the rose; and one Holds a bright serpent in a silken band. Her eye is on him, and his eye on her, As if she found in him one thing to love; As if he felt her beauty, not her chain, And lived upon her melancholy smile. Her song has stirr'd him; it has stirr'd herself; For on her eyelash hangs a glistening tear, The heart's quick tribute to times past and gone; And such wild sportings as he can he tries Before her powerful eye, and suits his dance, Swifter or slower, to her wandering song. He shoots along the violet floor, and lies Straight as a prostrate column, and as still As its pale marble; then sweeps up his coil, Surge upon surge, and lays his gorgeous head With its fix'd, sleepless eye i' the centre ring, The watcher of his living citadel; Then rolls away as loose as the sea-wave; Anon, he stoops like the wild swan, and shows A neck as arch'd and silvery; then the vine Must be outdone, and he's as lithe, and curl'd, And glistens through the leaves as proud a green. But now the song grows loftier, and his pomp Must all be worn to please his Indian queen. He rises from his train, that on the ground Floats in gold circles, and his glittering head Towers in the sunset, like a rising flame; And he has put on colours that make dim The stones o' the Indian mine: his length is sheathed In mail, that has for plates the mother-pearl, And for its studs the diamond: there's no ray That strikes his neck from that broad setting sun, But rings it with a collar of rich gems, Or sheets it in one emerald, or the flame Of rubies. From beneath his burning crest Flashes the eye, a living chrysolite, Yet fix'd in all its shootings on one form, That thanks its duty with a faint fond smile. So stands and shines he till the charm is done, And that sweet sound and sweeter smile have sunk In silence and in shade. A SKETCH FROM LIFE. “Minds dedicate To nothing temporal.” Shakspeare. Twilight was in the chamber, yet the flame That burn'd around the sun's descending throne In one long splendour through the casement came, Tinging the sofa's silk, the Parian stone, The pictures' sculptured frames, that partial shone Through that rich dusk, around the forms divine, By mind upon the Italian canvas thrown; Like the carved pillars of an eastern mine; The Indian's treasure-cave, and Vishnu's holy shrine. The beam swept round, till its full glory fell Upon an idol's, yet a woman's form; Her eye upon the sun, as if some spell For life had on it fix'd the lofty charm. She had been painting;—and her snowy arm Hung, pausing o'er the picture, like a ray; Her opening lip, her delicate cheek seem'd warm With Inspiration's fires;—till parting day Veil'd her in purple shades; and all sank soft away. ON A GRAVE AT WATERLOO. ? ?????, ???????? ??????????????, ??? ???? ???????, ???? ?????? ?????????? ????????. “Stranger, tell the Lacedæmonians, that we lie here, in obedience to their laws.”. Inscription at Thermopylæ. Stranger, though here no laurel wave, Here sleeps the bravest of the brave: And never earth saw obsequies Like his who in this green turf lies. The might of nations rushing here Beheld him close his high career; The sound in which he long'd to die, Rose mingled with his dying cry; Earth shook, the heavens were wrapt in gloom, The hour that laid him in the tomb; And the world heard, from shore to shore, The shout that told, the rite was o'er. The forms that stood the grave beside Were France and England's warrior-pride! The gale that caught his dying sigh Thunder'd with England's victory! And the last shout the heavens that tore Was France's blood-extinguish'd roar! ON A PORTRAIT, BY MASQUERIER, OF A LADY STANDING BEFORE A GLASS. SHE WAS THEN DYING OF A CONSUMPTION. She looks within the mirror, and her form Is from its dazzling crystal given again In living beauty; yet a hueless charm Is on the lip; the blue pellucid vein Wanders across a brow, where silent pain Sheds paleness on its polish'd ivory. The crimson of that cheek has felt the stain Of tears, that flow'd unseen by human eye, As from her pillow rose her midnight prayer—to die. And so she died,—in early beauty died, A violet by its first soft shower decay'd: A flash of radiance on life's changing tide, Just seen and loved, and sunk in evening's shade; A young sweet star, just rising, but to fade; And this fair image smiling in sad bloom On her, so soon in quiet to be laid, Looks like her angel, in its meekness come, To tell her of the tomb, her calm, her hallow'd tomb. INSCRIPTION ON AN URN. Thou loveliest of the lovely, where Is thy bright spirit gone? Where is thy gentle throne; In what sweet and silver sphere? Tell me, my Helena, that I All night on thee may gaze, And know thy temple's blaze From all the splendours of the sky. Oh! if the loved in death return, To love and look upon The pale, heart-broken one, Who weeps at midnight o'er their urn; Tell me, when on the blissful air They stoop, that I may be Found fit to welcome thee, With hands and heart upraised in prayer. Or art thou changed, and to mine eye A thing invisible; Wrapp'd in the unpierced veil Of holy immortality? No,—thou wilt stoop to earth no more, Thy glory were profaned By thoughts to earth still chain'd: My Helena,—thy trial's o'er. And I will follow thee above. Life's bitterness is past, The world is fading fast, Time has no chains for wedded love! SEGUIDILLA. TO LOVE. The more laborious poetry of Spain is generally disfigured by extravagances that may be a portion of its Saracen ancestry. But its trivial songs have sometimes a mixture of feeling and originality, scarcely inferior to the Greek. Those, however, are perhaps beyond translation. “Apetece tres cosas El Amor”, &amp;c. Young Tyrant of the bow and wings, Thy altar asks three precious things; The heart's, the world's most precious three, Courage, and Time, and Constancy! And Love must have them all, or none: By Time he's wearied, but not won; He shrinks from Courage hot and high; He laughs at tedious Constancy; But all his raptures, tender, true, sublime, Are given to Courage, Constancy, and Time. NAPOLEON. 1820. I hate thee, England! Not that thou Hast flung me where I perish now: Not that thy hand has stampt my name On valour's lips a scoff and shame; But that I see, and cursing see, Thy soil, the Temple of the free, Land of th'unconquerable mind, Still Champion, Sovereign of mankind! I hate thee, that thy matchless throne Shadows no slave on earth, but one; That one, Earth's ban and scorn, the slave That moulders in this dungeon-cave. And shall no after legend tell The glorious strife in which he fell: When rushing with his bosom gored Upon the shrinking victor's sword, The hero sent his dying groan In sounds like monarchies undone. Heaven! when in fire my eagles flew O'er thy red torrent, Waterloo, Had I but in the turning tide Plunged my dishonour'd head, and died! O had I but the heart to die! I fled—my legions saw me fly.— Now,—where yon billow darkly dashes, Must sleep the coward Exile's ashes; After many a shapeless day, Wasted, weary, worn away, After many an agony Crowding on the sleepless eye; Till, by the living world forgot, Nor regicide's nor rebel's thought Glancing tow'rds the distant wave, Where earthward bent, in dull decay The ancient Exile wastes away— I leave the prison for the grave! And my old murderers one by one Sink from me, left alone—alone! Like me with passing splendours curst And but for me, in evil first. Tost from a felon's streaming bier, Sleeps shroudless, base Labedoyere; Defiling with his gore the clay, Feasts the slow worm the Traitor Ney; And Murat's blazing remnants gave Pollution to the Italian wave. Fool!—on whose brow the royal ring I flung in mockery—to fling Contempt upon the name of king. The peasant musket laid him low, His knell is rung; what is he now! His life in guilt—his end in fear, Spain howling vengeance in his ear, So sank the man of massacre. So shall they perish, one and all, The bloodier rise, the bloodier fall; Each in his turn of terror laid Beneath the bullet or the blade; And every quivering slave shall die Concocting on his lip the lie, Spurn'd from life, yet loath to part, Telling of his loyal heart, Winding up with weep and wail His falsehood, idle, odious, stale. Oh! for the storm of woe and crime, That swept me upwards once, sublime; When cunning claim'd, what chance achieved, 'Till the wild dream myself deceived, Half deem'd of more than mortal birth, Or earthborn, but to trample earth; A cloud, earth's evil to absorb, Then stoop in lightnings on its orb; A planet, from its centre hurl'd, To dazzle and to waste the world; A sceptred, desperate, demon thing, Let loose for mankind's suffering, While earth my fiery transit eyed, Trembled, believed, and deified. 'Tis past—the crown in slaughter worn, From my dark brow in wrath was torn; I lived—to bear fate's basest blow, To cower before my proudest foe;— I lived—by drops my cup to drain, The rabble's laugh—the den, the chain; To kiss the dust, and fawn and whine For added days to days like mine. Till treason, murder, regicide, All that was born of man and pride, Turn'd from their recreant Chief in shame; 'Till, ere I perish'd, died my name, 'Till in this den of rock and wave, All left Napoleon to the grave! THE WINTER'S EVENING. FROM THE GREEK. “????????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????????? ????????.” Theocr. The sun is sinking in the fiery west; The clouds are rushing on their wild, wet wings; The lightning, like an eagle from its nest, In dazzling circles round the mountain springs; The groaning forest in the whirlwind swings, Strewing the marble cliffs with branches hoar; With cries of startled wolves the valley rings: And when the sullen sounds of earth are o'er, Ocean lifts up his voice, and thunders on the shore. Now close the portal!—'Tis the hour of hours! Though ancient Winter lords it o'er the sky, And the snow thickens on our leafless bowers; For now the few we love on earth are nigh. Ianthe! shall the livelong eve pass by Without one song from that red lip of thine? Come, fill the bowls, and heap the faggots high! To birds and flowers let Summer's morning shine, To nobler man alone the Winter eve's divine. AN ÆSTUARY. A CALM EVENING. Look on these waters, with how soft a kiss They woo the pebbled shore! then steal away, Like wanton lovers,—but to come again, And die in music!—There, the bending skies See all their stars,—and the beach-loving trees, Osiers and willows, and the watery flowers, That wreathe their pale roots round the ancient stones, Make pictures of themselves! MIDNIGHT. WRITTEN ON THE SEA-SHORE NEAR A LIGHT-HOUSE. It is the witching hour. The Night Sits on her cold, meridian height. And the starry troops are seen Camping round their ancient queen. Till upon the Eastern zone Ascends a rival to her throne. And the pearly, lunar horn Shines, but a more silent morn. Now the hamlet sounds are o'er Peasant laugh and closing door, And the lazy-ebbing tide Glistening leaves the seabeach wide. Yet ever and anon the ear Listens, with no unpleased fear, To the dreamy echoes deep Sighed from the earth's mysterious sleep The heavings of the elm and oak As if a spirit in them spoke; Drowsy sheep-bells, and the chime Where the distant turrets climb; Or the hum of waggoner, Singing, his slow team to cheer; Mingled with the watch-dog's bark, Warning rovers of the dark; Or the bell of midnight toll'd Dreary o'er the churchyard mould. But above my casement, wound With every flower that's sweetest found On heathy hill or blossom'd mead, By the virgin's May-morn tread; I see one sleepless, earthly star Shoot its wild splendours free and far, Defying night, and cloud, and shower, The meteor of yon seashore tower. Now, from ocean comes the gale, Mix'd with what might seem a wail; Where some gallant company Look their last upon the sky. Folding in its fleecy cloud The turret, like an idol proud Glaring in his Indian cave Over prostrate prince and slave. Now, afar the mist is blown, And the ruddy blaze is thrown Where along the slumbering tide The anchor'd ships like dolphins ride; Touching into woofs of light Sail and shroud, and pennant slight; Hanging on the village spire Tissues sweet of azure fire, And with fairy colour'd gleam Gilding the sweet-tinkling stream, That beneath the hawthorn-brake Glitters, like a summer snake, To where my lowly cottage roof Hides, from the worldly din aloof, Nestling in the fragrant twine Of bushy rose and jessamine. Now around me, and beneath, All is slumber, still as death; In my hand some pale, proud page Of mankind's high heroic age, By divinest Virgil sung, On his Mantuan lilies flung; Or the lovelorn poet,—he Who pined by the Propontis' sea; Or the strain that Sappho wept, Ere she to her death-bed swept. Or that Pindar's eagle wing Dash'd, immortal from the string. Then, in fancy's wayward fit, I turn to Chaucer's mystic wit; And in his old, enchanted glass, See pilgrim, nun, and warrior pass; Rosy smiles beneath the hood, Steel-clad bosoms love-subdued, Tonsured crowns, with roving eye, All the old-world pageantry! Or the blacken'd tome unhasp, Shrined in brazen fold and clasp, Where in the more than midnight veil Tells old Alchemy her tale, Secrets of a darker sphere, Making the flesh shrink to hear! How the mighty sigil tamed The Spirit, while he raved and flamed; Round the guarded circle wan Rushing still with wilder ban, Shaking from his dragon wings Poisons, and all monstrous things; Till within the crucible Star-bright rose the master-spell, And symphonies of earth and air Told the “Gem of gems” was there! Or, with curious vision mazed, I trace the monkish scroll, emblazed With gorgeous hues, and emblems high, Legends of church and chivalry; Kneeling saints, and prelates old, Monarchs, silk and ermine stol'd, Cup and crosier, helm and targe, Cluster'd on the dazzling marge! While that dazzling marge within Slumber blindness, pride, and sin. Thus bewitch'd the moments sweep, Till the honey-pinion'd sleep, With his pleasant murmuring, Seems in my drowzed ear to ring; And round my old, romantic nook I cast a superstitious look, As the woodbine's breezy train Waves across my rustic pane, And, to fancy's clouded gaze, Bluer winks the taper's blaze: Nurse-taught things, that stamp the brain, Though sullen reason call them vain! Then, shook off my ghostly fear, I watch the beacon's flaming sphere; Or, with awed, thought-wandering eye, Gaze on the blue Infinity; Where, before he treads the tomb, Man beholds the world to come. Thus charm'd dizziness, unchid, Alights upon my drooping lid; And, with due accustom'd prayer, Is closed the daily count of care; And the heart is lapp'd in dreams, Fann'd by fresh, flower-breathing steams Through the open casement sent; Till Aurora's Eastern tent Flames with chequer'd rose and gold, And the radiant clouds are roll'd Before the solar chariot-yoke, Like a Persian army broke: And before his fiery car Fades and flies the twilight star.

A Group of Patricians conversing in front. CETHEGUS, LENTULUS, ETC. CETHEGUS (speaking as he enters). We loiter here. I come from Catiline, To give you welcome in his name, and bid The banquet wait no longer. LENTULUS. Has he won? CETHEGUS. My life upon't, we're masters of the field! The people hung on every word he spoke, As if he were no mortal; but a god, Sent down in the declining age of Rome, To teach it ancient glory. LENTULUS. 'Tis told loftily— CETHEGUS. Envious as ever!—'Tis told honestly. You should have seen him in the Campus Martius,— In the tribunal,—shaking all the tribes With mighty speech. His words seem'd oracles, That pierced their bosoms; and each man would turn, And gaze in wonder on his neighbour's face, That with the like dumb wonder answer'd him: Then some would weep, some shout; some, deeper touch'd, Keep down the cry with motion of their hands, In fear but to have lost a syllable. The evening came, yet there the people stood, As if 'twere noon, and they the marble sea, Sleeping, without a wave. You could have heard The beating of your pulses while he spoke,— But, when he ceased, the shout was like the roar Of Ocean in the storm. LENTULUS. He lingers yet. Delay looks ominous. CETHEGUS. As I left the plain That smooth-tongued Cicero was in full harangue; And, just before I reach'd the walls, I heard The shouts again. The business must be done. On, to the palace! On. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Banquet in Catiline's Palace. Couches along the sides. Statues of Jove, Juno, and Minerva, on Thrones at the extremity of the Hall. Singers and Slaves in the distance. The Guests, crowned with Chaplets of Roses and Myrtle, lying on the Couches. The Singers advance and chaunt. CHORUS. I Day is done! Apollo's team Stems the purple ocean-stream; And, upon the eastern skies, Hesper opes his twinkling eyes; Telling to the weary earth, Now is come the hour of mirth. II Pour the wine, like golden ore, Due libation, on the floor; To the Graces, to the Nine! Venus, be the richest thine; So, from thine Olympian sphere, Mayst thou join our banquet here! Catiline suddenly enters the Hall; the Guests shout, “The Consul!” He advances hastily and moodily to the front: they come from the Couches, and surround him; he flings himself into a Chair. CATILINE. Are there not times, Patricians! when great states Rush to their ruin? Rome is no more like Rome, Than a foul dungeon's like the glorious sky. What is she now? Degenerate, gross, defiled; The tainted haunt, the gorged receptacle Of every slave and vagabond of earth: A mighty grave, that luxury has dug, To rid the other realms of pestilence; And, of the mountain of corruption there, Which once was human beings, procreate A buzzing, fluttering swarm; or venom tooth'd, A viper brood: insects and reptiles only! [The group draw back in surprise. CETHEGUS. We wait to hail you Consul. LENTULUS (aside.) He's undone! CATILINE. Consul! Look on me—on this brow—these hands; Look on this bosom, black with early wounds: Have I not served the state from boyhood up, Scatter'd my blood for her, labour'd for, loved her? I had no chance; wherefore should I be Consul? LENTULUS. So: Cicero still is master of the crowd? CATILINE. Why not? He's made for them, and they for him: They want a sycophant, and he wants slaves. Well, let him have them;—think no more on't, friends. The wine there! (calls).—If our tree is stript in Rome, May it not branch elsewhere? Give me a cup:— Here's to old Teucer's memory! CETHEGUS (starting forward with a cup) Here, I pledge Coriolanus! CATILINE. No! my hasty friend! Old Teucer!—He, that, when his country's fields Could find no room for him, let loose his sail To the first wind; pitch'd his enfranchised tent On the first desert shore, and drank his cup As cheerfully upon the pebbled sand, As in the sculptured halls of Telamon! Has not the hymn begun? To supper, friends! [With sudden emotion. Patricians! they have push'd me to the gulf; I have worn down my heart, wasted my means, Humbled my birth, barter'd my ancient name, For the rank favour of the senseless mass That frets and festers in your commonwealth: Ay, stalk'd with bended head and out-stretch'd hand, Smiling on this slave, and embracing that, Doing the candidate's whole drudgery. LENTULUS. Proud Catiline! (aside).—'Tis but the way with all. CATILINE (turning on him). What is 't to me, if all have stoop'd in turn? Does fellowship in chains make bondage proud? Does the plague lose its venom, if it taint My brother with myself? Is 't victory, If I but find, stretch'd by my bleeding side, All who came with me in the golden morn, And shouted as my banner met the sun? I cannot think on't.—There's no faith in earth! The very men with whom I walk'd through life, Nay, till within this hour, in all the bonds Of courtesy and high companionship, They all deserted me; Metellus, Scipio, Emilius, Cato, even my kinsman Cæsar,— All the chief names and senators of Rome, This day, as if the Heavens had stamp'd me black, Turn'd on their heel, just at the point of fate, Left me a mockery, in the rabble's midst, And followed their plebeian consul, Cicero! CETHEGUS. Nay, Catiline, you take this chance defeat Too heavily; you'll have 't another year. CATILINE. No! I have run my course. Another year! Why taunt me, sir? No—if their curule chair, Sceptre, and robe, and all their mummery, Their whole embodied consulate, were flung, Here, at my feet,—and all assembled Rome Knelt to me, but to stretch my finger out, And pluck them from the dust,—I'd scorn them all.— This was the day to which I look'd through life; And it has fail'd me—vanish'd from my grasp, Like air. I must not throw the honourable stake, That, won, is worth the world,—is glory, life; But, like a beaten slave, must stand aloof, While others sweep the board! CETHEGUS. A year is nothing. CATILINE. 'Tis fix'd!—Past talking now!—By Tartarus! From this curst day I seek and sue no more: If there be suing, it shall be by those Who have awoke the fever in my veins. No matter!—Nobles, when we deign to kneel, We should be trampled on. Sinews and swords,— They're the true canvassers:—The time may come!— Never for me!—My name 's extinguished—dead— Roman no more,—the rabble of the streets Have seen me humbled,—slaves may gibe at me. LENTULUS. Then Cicero's victor. CETHEGUS (repelling him). Let him rest.—Away! CATILINE (musing). Crime may be clear'd, and sorrow's eyes be dried; The lowliest poverty be gilded yet; The neck of airless, pale imprisonment Be lighten'd of its chains! For all the ills That chance or nature lays upon our heads, In chance or nature there is found a cure: But self-abasement is beyond all cure! The brand is there, burn'd in the living flesh, That bears its mark to the grave:—That dagger's plunged Into the central pulses of the heart; The act is the mind's suicide, for which There is no after-health—no hope—no pardon!— My day is done. What stops the feast?—Come on. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Grove.—Moonlight. Hamilcar, alone; he enters abruptly and perturbed. HAMILCAR. I hate their feastings: 't would have been my death, To stay in that close room! This air is cool.— I felt my spirit choked. Gods! was I born To bear those drunkards' tauntings on my hue, My garb—Numidia's garb! My native tongue— Not tunable to their Patrician ears? Will the blow never fall? There's not a slave, Not the most beggar'd, broken, creeping wretch That lives on alms, and pillows on the ground, But had done something before now; and I— A soldier, and a king; the blood of kings, Afric's last hope;—let months and years pass by, And still live on, a butt for ribald jests— And more, to let Numidia's injuries sleep, Like a chid infant's! This is a mortal hour; the rising wind Sounds angry, and those swift and dizzy clouds, Made ghostly by the glances of the moon, Seem horse and chariot for the evil shapes That scatter ruin here. Come from your tombs, Warriors of Afric!—from the desert sands— From the red field—the ever-surging sea, Though ye were buried deeper than the plumb Of seaman ever sounded. Hamilcar,—Hannibal,—Jugurtha! Come, My royal father! from the midnight den, Where their curst Roman axes murder'd thee! Ye shall have vengeance! Stoop upon my breast, Clear it of man, and put therein a heart, Like a destroying spirit's: make me fire, The winged passion that can know no sleep, Till vengeance has been done;—wrap up my soul In darkness stronger than an iron mail, Till it is subtle, deadly, deep as night, Close as coil'd aspics, still as tigers couch'd, But furious as them roused. Let me fill Rome With civil tumult, hate, conspiracy, All dissolution of all holy ties, 'Till she has outraged Heaven, while I, unseen, Move like a spectre round a murderer's bed, To start upon her dying agony. Hark! Who disturbs the night? [He listens. Cethegus' voice! One of those drunkards—a hot-headed fool; Senseless and brave as his own sword.—Hallo! [He calls. I'll try what mischief's in his mettle now. [Cethegus comes in. CETHEGUS. Ho! prince of darkness—emperor of the Nile— Star-gazer!—you are welcome to them all;— Rome is no place for you! put on your wings, And perch upon the moon! You left us all Just in our glory. HAMILCAR. 'Twas a noble set! CETHEGUS. Rome has none better;—all patrician blood, Glowing with Cyprus' wine,—wild as young stags— Bold as bay'd boars—haughty as battle steeds— Keen as flesh'd hounds—fire-eyed as mounting hawks— HAMILCAR. 'Twill be a glorious day that lets them soar. How was 't with Catiline? CETHEGUS. He seem'd to feel The fiercest joy of all; pledged Heaven and Earth In brimming goblets; talk'd a round of things, Lofty and rambling as an ecstacy; Laugh'd, till his very laughter check'd our mirth, And all gazed on him; then, as if surprised, Marking the silence, mutter'd some excuse, And sank in reverie; then, wild again, Talk'd, drank, and laugh'd—the first of Bacchanals! HAMILCAR. That looks like madness (aside). He has been abused: The consulate was his by right. CETHEGUS. By right; Ay, or by wrong!—had I been Catiline, I should have knock'd out Cicero's brains. HAMILCAR (advancing to him). Speak low; The trees in Rome are spies. It may be done.— The great Patricians hate him, though some few Lacquey his steps. Were Catiline but roused To draw the sword, this talker would be left Bare as his pedigree. CETHEGUS (in surprise). Raise war in Rome? HAMILCAR. No,—but take down the consul's haughtiness; Make the Patricians what they ought to be, Rome's masters; and restore the forfeitures Now in plebeian hands. CETHEGUS. Show me but that; And I am his, or your's, or any man's. My fortune's on my back; the usurers Have my last acre in their harpy hands. HAMILCAR. You must have Catiline, for he has all That makes such causes thrive—a mighty name, One that the youth will cling to; a bold tongue— A bolder heart—a soldier's skill in arms— A towering and deep-rooted strength of soul, That, like the oak, may shake in summer's wind, But, stript by winter, stands immoveable. CETHEGUS. He's a tried soldier. HAMILCAR. A most gallant one! CETHEGUS. You've seen him in the field? HAMILCAR. Ay, fifty times,— I'the thickest fight; where all was blood and steel; Plunging through steeds unrider'd, gory men Mad with their wounds, through lances thick as hail, As if he took the ranks for idle waves! Now seen, the battle's wonder; now below, Mowing his desperate way, till, with wild shrieks, The throng roll'd back, and Catiline sprang out, Red from the greaves to the helm. CETHEGUS. He shall be ours! Then, Rome is full of mal-contents; the land Cumber'd with remnants of the war; the slaves Will crowd to his first call; then, in his house He has the banner that the Marian troops Still worship like a god;—but he will call The act conspiracy. HAMILCAR. Jove save us all! CETHEGUS. How now, Hamilcar? HAMILCAR (going). Fare you well, my lord. [He suddenly returns. Conspiracy! Is not the man undone? All over bankrupt, broken right and left— Within this week he'll be without a rood, A roof, a bed, a robe, a meal to eat! Conspiracy! He's levell'd;—on the earth! His last denarius hung upon this day, And now you have him. This day has dissolved His last allegiance. Go—you'll find him now Tormented, like the hound that bays the moon, Foaming to see the pomp beyond his reach. CETHEGUS. He has forsworn the world! HAMILCAR. 'Tis laughable! CETHEGUS. If he draw back! HAMILCAR. Draw back! You'll find him flame. Go to the banquet, ere they all break up; Yet, should he chill,—provoke him—stir dispute— Seize on his hasty word. The revellers there Will take it for command; and thus his name Be mix'd with tumult, till the lion snared Is forced to battle. CETHEGUS. Then, to Catiline! I may be king or consul yet. HAMILCAR. Away! [Cethegus goes. HAMILCAR. The hour of blood's at hand! [Draws his dagger. Be thou my god! Away, bold fool! O, Rome! those are thy men! Ay—you shall have a crown,—a crown of straw; Chains for your sceptre; for your honours stripes; And for your kingly court a maniac's cell; Where you and your compeers may howl to th'night, And rave rebellion. [Exit. SCENE IV. A Street: the Portal of Cicero's Palace at one Side. A Crowd of Patricians from the Banquet, with Garlands on their Heads, and Torches and Swords in their Hands, rush in tumultuously, led by Cethegus. They stop and gather round him as he addresses them. FIRST PATRICIAN. Silence! CETHEGUS. Roman youth! SECOND PATRICIAN (keeping back the crowd). Gallant Cethegus speaks— CETHEGUS. Patricians! Shall the tale be told in Rome, That upstarts should engross the consulate? FIRST PATRICIAN. By Romulus! it is a common shame To every nobleman! CETHEGUS. Who's Cicero? A peasant; an Arpinian. No man knows This Consul's grandfather. A talking slave, That makes his bread by squabbles in the courts. SECOND PATRICIAN. A dastard! that wears armour in the streets, To make the rabble roar for him. CETHEGUS. Come on! Yonder's the upstart's house. There's not a rogue That rubs our horses' heels, or sweeps our gates, But may be consul now. There's not a year, But some base Sabine, or Apulian clown, Will beard us at the elections. All he wants Is cunning, and low flattery of the tribes, To seize the fasces. THIRD PATRICIAN. We must have him down. FOURTH PATRICIAN. We'll fire the house, and give the orator, More than his father had, a funeral pile. CETHEGUS. Now to your work, Patricians! If his guards— SECOND PATRICIAN (recoiling). Troops in the house? CETHEGUS. Ay—lictors, Greeks, and slaves! We'll storm his garrison; we'll make him show His generalship! THIRD PATRICIAN (laughing). He was a general once. FIRST PATRICIAN. Ay, in Cilicia; where he swears he fought— CETHEGUS. The highwaymen! [Shouts and laughing. Now strike—for Catiline! [They rush within the Gates. The Scene closes. END OF THE FIRST ACT. ACT II. SCENE I. THE SECOND DAY. An Apartment in Catiline's Palace. He enters, reading a Letter, and perturbed. CATILINE. Flung on my pillow! Does the last night's wine Perplex me still? Its words are wild and bold. (Reads) “Noble Catiline! where you tread, the earth is hollow, though it gives no sound. There is a storm gathering, though there are no clouds in the sky. Rome is desperate; three hundred Patricians have sworn to do their duty; and what three hundred have sworn, thirty thousand will make good.” Why, half the number now might sack the city, With all its knights, before a spear could come From Ostia to their succour.—'Twere a deed!— (Reads) “You have been betrayed by the Senate, betrayed by the Consuls, and betrayed by the people. You are a Roman, can you suffer chains? You are a soldier, can you submit to shame? You are a man; will you be ruined, trampled on, disdained?” [Flinging away the paper. Disdain'd! They're in the right—It tells the truth— I am a scoff and shame—a public prate.— There's one way left: (draws a poniard) this dagger in my heart— The quickest cure! But, 'tis the coward's cure;— And what shall heal the dearer part of me, My reputation? What shield's for my name, When I shall fling it, like my corpse, to those Who dared not touch it living, for their lives? So, there lies satisfaction; and my veins Must weep—for nothing! when my enemies Might be compell'd to buy them drop by drop. No! by the Thunderer, they shall pay their price. To die! in days when helms are burnishing; When heaven and earth are ripening for a change; And die by my own hand!—Give up the game Before the dice are thrown!—Clamour for chains, Before the stirring trumpet sounds the charge!— Bind up my limbs—a voluntary mark For the world's enginery, the ruffian gibe, The false friend's sneer, the spurn of the safe foe, The sickly, sour hypocrisy, that loves To find a wretch to make its moral of, Crushes the fallen, and calls it Charity!— Sleep in your sheath! [He puts up the poniard. How could my mind give place To thoughts so desperate, rash, and mutinous? Fate governs all things. Madman! would I give Joy to my enemies, sorrow to my friends,— Shut up the gate of hope upon myself? My sword may thrive!— Dreams, dreams! My mind's as full Of vapourish fantasies as a sick girl's! I will abandon Rome,—give back her scorn With tenfold scorn: break up all league with her,— All memories. I will not breathe her air, Nor warm me with her fire, nor let my bones Mix with her sepulchres. The oath is sworn. [Aurelia enters with papers. AURELIA. What answer's for this pile of bills, my lord? CATILINE. Who can have sent them here? AURELIA. Your creditors! As if some demon woke them all at once, These have been crowding on me since the morn. Here, Caius Curtius claims the prompt discharge Of his half million sesterces; besides The interest on your bond, ten thousand more. Six thousand for your Tyrian canopy; Here, for your Persian horses—your Trireme: Here, debt on debt. Will you discharge them now? CATILINE. I'll think on it. AURELIA. It must be now; this day! Or, by to-morrow, we shall have no home. CATILINE. 'Twill soon be all the same. AURELIA. We are undone! My gold, my father's presents, jewels, rings— All, to the baubles on my neck, are gone. The consulship might have upheld us still; But now,—we must go down. CATILINE. Aurelia!—wife! All will be well; but hear me—stay—a little; I had intended to consult with you— On—our departure—from—the city. AURELIA (indignantly and surprised.) Rome? CATILINE. Even so, fair wife! even so: we must leave Rome. AURELIA. Let me look on you; are you Catiline? CATILINE. I know not what I am,—we must begone! AURELIA. Madness! CATILINE (wildly.) Not yet—not yet! AURELIA. Let them take all? CATILINE. The gods will have it so! AURELIA. Seize on your house? CATILINE. Seize my last sesterce! Let them have their will. We must endure. Ay, ransack—ruin all; Tear up my father's grave,—tear out my heart. Wife! the world's wide,—Can we not dig or beg? Can we not find on earth a den, or tomb? AURELIA. Before I stir, they shall hew off my hands. CATILINE. What's to be done? AURELIA. Hear me, Lord Catiline: The day we wedded.—'Tis but three short years! You were the first patrician here,—and I— Was Marius' daughter! There was not in Rome An eye, however haughty, but would sink When I turn'd on it: when I pass'd the streets My chariot wheel was followed by a host Of your chief senators; as if their gaze Beheld an empress on its golden round; An earthly providence! CATILINE. 'Twas so!—'t was so! But it is vanish'd—gone. AURELIA. By you bright Sun! That day shall come again; or, in its place, One that shall be an era to the world! CATILINE. What's in your thoughts? [Eagerly. AURELIA. Our high and hurried life Has left us strangers to each other's souls: But now we think alike. You have a sword; Have had a famous name i'the legions! CATILINE. Hush! AURELIA. Have the walls ears? Great Jove! I wish they had; And tongues too, to bear witness to my oath, And tell it to all Rome. CATILINE. Would you destroy? AURELIA. Were I a thunderbolt!— Rome's ship is rotten: Has she not cast you out; and would you sink With her, when she can give you no gain else Of her fierce fellowship? Who 'd seek the chain, That link'd him to his mortal enemy? Who 'd face the pestilence in his foe's house? Who, when the poisoner drinks by chance the cup, That was to be his death, would squeeze the dregs, To find a drop to bear him company? CATILINE. It will not come to this. [Shrinking. AURELIA (haughtily). Shall we be dragg'd, A show to all the city rabble;—robb'd,— Down to the very mantle on our backs,— A pair of branded beggars! Doubtless Cicero— CATILINE. Cursed be the ground he treads! Name him no more. AURELIA. Doubtless he 'll see us to the city gates; 'Twill be the least respect that he can pay To his fallen rival. Do you hear, my lord? Deaf as the rock (aside). With all his lictors shouting, “Room for the noble vagrants; all caps off For Catiline! for him that would be Consul.” CATILINE (turning away). Thus to be, like the scorpion, ring'd with fire, Till I sting mine own heart! (aside.) There is no hope! AURELIA. One hope there is, worth all the rest—Revenge! The time is harass'd, poor, and discontent; Your spirit practised, keen, and desperate,— The senate full of feuds,—the city vext With petty tyranny,—the legions wrong'd— CATILINE (scornfully). Yet, who has stirr'd? Woman, you paint the air With Passion's pencil. AURELIA. Were my will a sword! CATILINE. Hear me, bold heart! The whole gross blood of Rome Could not atone my wrongs! I'm soul-shrunk, sick, Weary of man! And now my mind is fix'd For Lybia: there to make companionship Rather of bear and tiger,—of the snake,— The lion in his hunger,—than of man! AURELIA. I had a father once, who would have plunged Rome in the Tiber for an angry look! You saw our entrance from the Gaulish war, When Sylla fled? CATILINE. My legion was in Spain. AURELIA. We swept through Italy, a flood of fire, A living lava, rolling straight on Rome. For days, before we reach'd it, the whole road Was throng'd with suppliants—tribunes, consulars; The mightiest names o'the state. Could gold have bribed, We might have pitch'd our tents, and slept on gold. But we had work to do:—Our swords were thirsty. We enter'd Rome, as conquerors, in arms; I by my father's side, cuirass'd and helm'd, Bellona beside Mars. CATILINE (with coldness). The world was yours! AURELIA. Rome was all eyes; the ancient totter'd forth; The cripple propp'd his limbs beside the wall; The dying left his bed to look, and die. The way before us was a sea of heads; The way behind a torrent of brown spears: So, on we rode, in fierce and funeral pomp, Through the long, living streets, that sank in gloom, As we, like Pluto and Proserpina, Enthroned, rode on—like twofold destiny! CATILINE (sternly—interrupting her). Those triumphs are but gewgaws. All the earth, What is it? Dust and smoke. I've done with life! AURELIA (coming closer, and looking steadily upon him). Before that eve—one hundred senators— And fifteen hundred knights, had paid—in blood, The price of taunts, and treachery, and rebellion! Were my tongue thunder—I would cry, Revenge! CATILINE (in sudden wildness). No more of this! In, to your chamber, wife! There is a whirling lightness in my brain, That will not now bear questioning.—Away! [As Aurelia moves slowly towards the door. Where are our veterans now? Look on these walls; I cannot turn their tissues into life. Where are our revenues—our chosen friends? Are we not beggars? Where have beggars friends? I see no swords and bucklers on these floors! I shake the state! I—What have I on earth But these two hands? Must I not dig or starve?— Come back! I had forgot. My memory dies, I think, by the hour. Who sups with us to-night? Let all be of the rarest,—spare no cost.— If 'tis our last;—it may be—let us sink In sumptuous ruin, with wonderers round us, wife! Our funeral pile shall send up amber smokes; We'll burn in myrrh, or—blood! [She goes. I feel a nameless pressure on my brow, As if the heavens were thick with sudden gloom; A shapeless consciousness, as if some blow Were hanging o'er my head. They say, such thoughts Partake of prophecy. [He stands at the casement. This air is living sweetness. Golden sun, Shall I be like thee yet? The clouds have past— And, like some mighty victor, he returns To his red city in the west, that now Spreads all her gates, and lights her torches up, In triumph for her glorious conqueror. (Hamilcar enters hastily.) HAMILCAR. Do I disturb you? 'Tis the morning's talk, That some of those who supp'd with you last night Have been arrested. CATILINE (with anger). And by whom? HAMILCAR. The consul! 'Tis said, Cethegus headed an attack On Cicero's house: his slaves were on the watch, The rioters seized; and now the rumour goes That bills of treason will be moved to-day Against them in the Senate. CATILINE. They were rash— But must be saved. HAMILCAR. I think some mighty change— Some general shaking of the commonwealth, Is not far off. CATILINE. It cannot come too soon. HAMILCAR. The heavens and earth are full of prodigies.— Rome shrinks.—Of late no victim has been slain, But its blood quench'd the altar. Romulus' wolf Last night was struck by lightning. Thunderbolts Have fallen on many temples. Heavy gore Drops from Jove's statue in the Capitol. CATILINE (coldly). Your wonders are but chance. HAMILCAR. Chance can do nothing. There's no turn of earth; No—not the blowing of the summer wind, Or the unstable sailing of a cloud, Much more the destiny of mighty states,— But hath a will that orders it. CATILINE. Let time tell. Your brain is always rich in fantasies; Your birth has done it—not the restless time; The spirit of your fiery land of spells Is colouring the common things of life Into mysterious splendour. HAMILCAR. And I dream! All Rome has seen the comet risen by Mars. CATILINE (anxiously). What is't to me?—Yet I have had my dreams.— Last night I could not rest: the chamber's heat, Or some wild thoughts—the folly of the day— Banish'd my sleep:—So, in the garden air, I gazed upon the comet, that then shone In midnight glory, dimming all the stars. At once a crimson blaze, that made it pale, Flooded the north. I turn'd, and saw, in heaven, Two mighty armies! From the zenith star, Down to the earth, legions in line and orb, Squadron and square, like earthly marshalry. Anon, as if a sudden trumpet spoke, Banners of gold and purple were flung out; Fire-crested leaders swept along the lines; And both the gorgeous depths, like meeting seas, Roll'd to wild battle. Then, they breathed awhile, Leaving the space between a sheet of gore, Strew'd with torn standards, corpses, and crash'd spears. But soon upon the horizon's belt uprose, Moon-like, or richer,—like the rising morn, A bulwark'd city. HAMILCAR (eagerly). Rome? CATILINE. Both armies join'd; And, like a deluge, rush'd against the walls. One chieftain led both armies to the storm, Till the proud Capitol in embers fell,— And heaven was all on fire! Valerius enters with Papers; Catiline, startled, turns round, exclaiming— My ancient friend! VALERIUS. Letters from Caius Manlius. [He gives despatches. HAMILCAR (aside). Now, temptation! CATILINE. What do I see? (Reads) “We have heard of the comitia:—Come to us, and be once more a hero;—we have ten thousand veterans;—a day's march, and an hour's fighting, will punish your enemies—save your friends—turn the Senate into ciphers— and make you—dictator!” HAMILCAR (aside). That's to his heart's core. CATILINE (musing). To be clear'd at once,— To taunt the taunter,—lay the proud in the dust,— To show the fools the man they have disdain'd!— VALERIUS (to HAMILCAR). The tidings seem to stir him. HAMILCAR (turning to CATILINE). Why, my lord, Your brow grows cloudy, and you clench your hand, As if it held your spear. CATILINE (perturbed). The news is sudden. HAMILCAR. Were you not born in the Calends? CATILINE (gloomily). Well? HAMILCAR. Last night I pass'd an hour upon the battlements; Mars glow'd in the horizon—Jove sat high In zenith splendour. Right between their orbs, The comet, i'the meridian, reign'd over heaven. CATILINE (eagerly). Sign of a leader at his army's head? HAMILCAR. Sign of a king! Just then the second watch Rang from the trumpets in the Capitol. CATILINE (aside). My natal hour! HAMILCAR. I drew the horoscope; The circle of the trine, from Mars to Jove, Enclosed a throne—but to be won by war! CATILINE (musing). Can the Heavens lie? HAMILCAR (loftily). Summon your augurs—your astrologers— Your Chaldee men of vision—that for years Sit on their Babylonish temple tops, And read no book but the eternal sky.— Not one of them dares cope, this hour, with me. CATILINE (in astonishment). Hamilcar! HAMILCAR. Ay—the African!—the slave! You knew him not the master of the spells, That shake the earth's foundations! CATILINE (drawing back in surprise). A magician! HAMILCAR. In my own land, and hunting through the hills, I've sat, from eve to sunrise, in the caves Of Atlas, circled by the enchanters' fires, And mingled with them;—men who yearly came, By compact, to hold solemn festival:— Some riding fiery dragons,—some on shafts Of the sunn'd topaz,—some on ostrich plumes, Or wond'rous cars, that press'd the subtle air No heavier than its clouds,—some in swift barks, That lit the Lybian sea through night and storm, Like winged volcanoes. From all zones of the earth— From the mysterious fountains of the Nile— Gold-sanded Niger—India's diamond shore— From silken China,—from the Spicy Isles, Like urns of incense set i'the purple sea By Taprobane. CATILINE. Conclave of guilt and power! Could they fear mortal man? HAMILCAR. They honour'd me; For in my veins they saw the ancient blood Of mighty necromancers, Afric's kings; And took delight in showing me their spells, Immortal essences, amalgams, seals, Strong talismans, that keep the Egyptian's gold Shrin'd in the pyramids;—the Brahmin signs, The mystic Ten, that measure ocean's sands, The forest leaves, and stars;—the arrowy words, That guard the slumbers of the genie king Beneath Persepolis;—all powers of gems! CATILINE (strongly agitated). 'Tis glorious!—But they say in Rome, such thoughts Lead men to madness! It was in your youth?— Will not such knowledge perish from the mind, Like all things else? [Grasping his hand. Hamilcar, there are times, When man would give his life, a willing price, To know the chance that but an hour might bring! HAMILCAR (loftily). Years cannot touch those mysteries. I could now Arch this high hall with fire, or sudden blood; Cover your floors with vipers. I have power To summon shrinking spirits from the grave; To bring the hungry lion from his spoil; To make the serpent worship at my feet; To fling th'eclipse's mantle round the moon, Turning her light to blood; nay, bind a spell So strong upon the fountains of the air, That all the stars should sicken, and, unsphered, Throw night into confusion,—or foretell, In blazonry like day, the fate of those Who grasp at empire! [Fixing his eyes on Catiline. CATILINE (gloomily). I dare ask no sign That's wrought by necromancy. HAMILCAR. I dare work No sign, if you dared ask it—while I'm here, A hostage. 'Tis our magic's first, great law, That none shall wield its wonders but the free. CATILINE (musing). Here's glory, power, ambition's godlike thirst, Slaked to the full. Then, on the other side, Exile and foul defeat; a traitor's grave; Slaughters and scaffolds of my trusting friends. Oh! for a thunderpeal to right or left, That I might toss no more upon the rack Of this uncertainty. Aurelia enters hastily. AURELIA. I have brought tidings for you! Civil war! CATILINE (eagerly). Has it broke out? AURELIA. Beside us! HAMILCAR (aside). Tartarus, hear! AURELIA. 'Tis but this moment the Proconsul Curtius Has pass'd our porch, borne on his soldiers' necks, Wounded to death. CATILINE. How,—when,—where was 't? AURELIA. At Ostia! An army of disbanded veterans Last night tore down the gates, and set the fleet In flames. CATILINE. What more—what more? AURELIA. The cavalry, That fled with Curtius, brought a rebel flag; Your name was on't. CATILINE. 'Tis destiny! [Noise without. HAMILCAR. It thunders! AURELIA. No; you hear the people's shouts! Rome is all uproar. All the magistrates Have just been summon'd to the Capitol; The knights, half arm'd, are hurrying to the walls; The people at the corners stand in groupes, Outlying each his fellow,—full of news, Visions, strange treasons, fearful prodigies, Till all grow pale and silent with their fear: Then rides some courier clattering through the streets, With his spur buried in his panting horse, And breaks their trance with his swift-utter'd tale. You'd think another Hannibal was come, After another Cannæ. CATILINE (musing). Thanks! ye Gods! AURELIA (scornfully). He goes to pray on 't.—Rise, lord Catiline! Have you been drinking Lethe? [Shouts without. HAMILCAR (aside). Ay—howl on, Ye Roman dogs:—Rebellion's in that roar! CATILINE. I heard a funeral trumpet, if my ears Are not bewilder'd.—Hark! it sounds again! Cecina enters in a military robe. CATILINE (hastily turning and approaching him). Who's this? Cecina! welcome!—what's the news? Has there been battle? Is the sword unsheath'd? CECINA. I come, to tell the Senate that the slaves Have risen through all Apulia, and are now Marching to Rome: I fought my way through them. HAMILCAR (aside). The wind is rising; we shall see the storm! CATILINE. This is like news! The slaves in arms! To Rome! This will breed blows! 'Twill try the Senate's brains. Let their new consuls look to 't. (A trumpet). Hark! again? What Roman has bid farewell to the world? CECINA. Bear up this grief, my lord, like all the rest. Your son— CATILINE. Sulpicius! CECINA. Has been basely slain! CATILINE. Great Jove! [He hides his face in his robe. CECINA. The prætor's guards at Baiæ sack'd your house,— He died upon the threshold: I have brought His body here, with honour, as becomes A brave man's memory. CATILINE (turning away). Let the corse come in. [The body is brought in on a bier, carried by soldiers, Catiline rushes over to it. Cecina, who did this? I'll have revenge! Villains and murderers! What's the good of life, If we but live to look upon such sights? There lies the hope of all my fathers' line! Our race extinguish'd!—Here's a gaping wound,— So wide—his life fled through it!—Cicero! Could you not spare?—Good friends; I'm sick at heart— This blow has wither'd me. The world's a dream— Your poniard, sir! (to Cecina.) My grave must be that bier. [He flings himself on the body. Lentulus enters. LENTULUS. My lord, prepare yourself! A multitude Are coming to your house,—are in your porch,— Led by a herald, who, by sound of trumpet, Is now proclaiming Cicero Supreme— HAMILCAR. Dictator! There's the blow! All's lost in Rome! AURELIA. In Rome!—But, is the world contain'd in Rome? Let me be once beyond the walls—I'll find— CATILINE (lifting his head from the bier feebly.) Exiles and slaves! AURELIA (with ardour.) I say, a host of friends,— Tried hearts, of the true mould for victory: They swam through blood for Marius,—and for you They'd rush through fire, were you but—Catiline! VALERIUS (and the others approaching him.) Our troops are in the field,—Mars might be proud To leave his throne, and be their general! HAMILCAR. There are brave friends in Rome! AURELIA. He will not hear! CATILINE (faintly). Psha! Masquers, dancers, dicers,—fitting hands To play the iron soldier! Here's my hope— My tree cut down. Why struggle for a name, That, when I perish, perishes! Pale boy! My health, wealth, heart, my life are on thy bier! [He falls on the body. HAMILCAR. Rome summons you! AURELIA. Arise! must we be brain'd While you lie dreaming there?—Ho! Catiline! Disgrace is on you,—danger by your side, Like a chain'd wolf, devouring with his eyes, Before he's loosed to tear you. LENTULUS (approaching him). He will die. HAMILCAR (vehemently). The new dictator's calling for our heads,— The lictors are afoot,—the block is ready! [A knocking is heard, with clamours, and trumpets; the doors are flung open, and a herald enters with soldiery.] The Herald reads:— “Lucius Sergius Catiline; by command of the dictator, you are summoned to the temple of Jupiter Stator, at the second hour of the night, to answer solemnly before the Senate to attempts on his life, and other manifold treasons against the majesty of Rome.” [He retires with the crowd. [Catiline, who had raised himself from the Bier while the Herald read; now advances to a Shrine in the extremity of the Hall, and brings out a legionary Eagle, covered with a black veil. He speaks in a wild and solemn tone.] CATILINE. Look, Romans, on this sign, and worship it! If ever parted spirit walk'd the earth, Haunting the treasure that it loved in life, We stand this hour in presence of a thing, That, bodied to our senses, would let loose Our strength like water—strike our eyes with night— Fill the hot brain with the unwholesome thoughts That shake the reason.—This was Marius' gift! Given by its master on his dying bed; A nobler legacy than if his hand Had shower'd down gold. But 't was upon my oath Never to lift it in a Roman field. AURELIA. You dare not lift it. CATILINE. No; for th'ungrateful Rome, That he had saved. Yet, if I stood in arms Against her, then but strip this mystery— [He uncovers the eagle. And the immortal spirit from his throne Should follow it through battle—till the sword Had done its work; and helms, on bloody brows, Were changed for diadems. HAMILCAR. Let me adore The talisman! [He bends before it. CATILINE. Its equal's not on earth! The metal fell from Heaven in thunder-peals; 'Twas temper'd in strange fire of warriors' bones; Then shaped, at shuddering midnight, to wild songs, That made the yawning earth give up her ghosts, Mix'd with the unhallow'd spirits, that all day Had toss'd on beds of adamant and fire. AURELIA. Let me see spears; leave magic to its fools. CATILINE. 'Tis spear and shield. When Scipio was repulsed Before Numantia, Marius, yet a boy, With but this banner in his bold right hand, Mounted the breach, and closed the war at once. When the wild Teutons butchered Cæpio's legions, He rear'd this banner, till his Roman knights Dropp'd on their horses' necks, through weariness Of making corpses. When the Cimbri came, Reckon'd by hundred thousands, and Rome shrank, As in the shadow of a thunder cloud; He rear'd this banner. From that battle's blood New rivers sprang; the ancient streams were chok'd With German carnage. Through a winter's nights Night was like day with piles of burning dead, Waggons and shatter'd arms, barbaric spoils! Dissensions rose in Rome; this eagle's wing Blazed o'er his helmet, and her mightiest swords Were edgeless in that mystic blaze. He died— But not till he was master of the world! HAMILCAR. I met the chieftains of the Allobroges To-day in the Forum;—brimful of complaints Against the Senate's justice. AURELIA (with eagerness). They have troops!— CATILINE. And gallant ones. I led them once in Spain. HAMILCAR. They talk half rebel, and leave Rome to-night. CATILINE. I'll see them first. AURELIA. The senate meet to-night, If you go there, you're lost. CATILINE (loftily). And have I borne The brunt of Parthian bows and Spanish pikes? O'er half the world shook hands with grim-faced death, To shrink before some dozen bearded fools? By Mars! I'll meet those doting senators, Aye; stand within their prostrate ring, like one, More god than man,—that, walking through the storm, Had homage of the lightnings,—stood unblench'd,— Arm'd only in his grandeur. I will meet them. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Temple of the Allobroges. DUMNORIX, ARMINIUS, ETC. A Cavern: in the Centre an Altar, with Incense, beneath the Statue of a Barbarian Goddess; a golden Axe and Helmet on the Altar; a curtained Recess in the Distance. Gaulish Priests standing before the Altar, with Warriors. They chaunt:— Queen of the clouds! that mak'st thy purple throne Upon our forest hills! Queen of the thousand rills, That fall in silver from the dewy stone! Queen of myrtles, and the vine, Dropping ruby on the snows That diadem the Alps' eternal brows,— Hear us, great goddess, from thy mystic shrine! DUMNORIX. Break off; I hear a stranger's foot. ARMINIUS (goes to the gate and calls). Who comes? CATILINE (without). A friend to Gaul. [He enters, with his robe on his face, and advances to the altar. He uncovers his face. DUMNORIX (startled). He is a Roman! [The warriors surround him. ARMINIUS to CATILINE (haughtily). If you come to share Our worship, welcome; but if you would act The spy, you perish. No!—take back your news, And tell your lords that we are still their slaves, And meek as ever. CATILINE. I have come for both— And yet for neither. I would join your rites, If they're for liberty! and I would spy What clay the hearts are of, that live in chains. DUMNORIX. Stranger, those words are dangerous! We are here Sent by our nation with the annual gifts To Rome, and to this temple; not to talk Of things above our wisdom. ARMINIUS (eagerly). Let him speak! Words are not spears. Who are you? [To Catiline. CATILINE. I'm a man! And, therefore, I can feel for fellow men. What would you give for freedom? ARMINIUS. Death or life! CATILINE (ardently). For freedom, if it stood before your eyes; For freedom, if it rush'd to your embrace; For freedom, if its sword were ready drawn To hew your chains off? DUMNORIX. We must hear no more! Roman, we are free.— CATILINE. Free! and ye stand in Rome! Free! and ye bring her tribute. Men of Gaul, I know you to be brave—in honour keen; Taking no slight, but to be paid in blood!— And then must I be told, that—when the whips Of tyranny are ringing on your back; When you are taunted, beggar'd, buffeted,— Trampled like dogs; like dogs you'd lick the foot That tramples you? No! by the avenging Mars! I know that you are groaning in your souls Over your abject country. Where's your name? Swallow'd in Rome! Your land its wanton prey; Your throne its footstool; your old hallow'd laws The jest of Roman prætors. Nay; your gods Are none of yours! This image is Rome's spoil. [Pointing to the statue. Dragg'd from your capital; yet ye are free! ARMINIUS. He speaks the truth. Sir, we are beaten slaves; Mere tribute-payers; cumberers of the earth; Cradled in fetters; bred and buried in them. I heard a Roman say so once. CATILINE. And you— Let him escape? ARMINIUS. Why, ay!—into his grave! I drove a bondsman's dagger through his throat. CATILINE. Soldier, your hand! a hundred such as you Would give an empire freedom! Will you strike? ARMINIUS. This is brave speech! DUMNORIX. Yet, stranger, where's your pledge? We are beset with spies. ARMINIUS (advancing to him). Who are you? CATILINE. Catiline! [They start back and gaze on him. DUMNORIX. The great patrician! CATILINE. Yes; an hour ago— But now the rebel! Rome's eternal foe! And your sworn friend! My desperate wrong's my pledge. There's not in Rome,—no—not upon the earth, A man so wrong'd. The very ground I tread Is grudged me. Chieftains! ere the moon be down My lands will be the senate's spoil; my life The mark of the first villain that will stab For lucre. But their time's at hand!—Gaze on! If I had thought you cowards, I might have come And told you lies. You have me now, the thing I am;—Rome's enemy!—and fix'd as fate To you and yours for ever. ARMINIUS. What's to be done? DUMNORIX. The state is strong! CATILINE (vehemently). The state is weak as dust. Rome's broken, helpless, heart-sick! Vengeance sits Above her,—like a vulture o'er a corpse Soon to be tasted. Time, and dull decay, Have let the waters round her pillar's foot; And it must fall. Her boasted strength's a ghost, Fearful to dastards;—yet, to trenchant swords, Thin as the passing air! A single blow, In this diseased and crumbling frame of Rome, Would break your chains like stubble. ARMINIUS. We have fought For Rome on plain and mountain, shore and sea. CATILINE. What have you for your blood? ARMINIUS. Flat slavery! Lucius Muræna came as proconsul, And at his heels a host of plunderers; Prætors and præfects, quæstors,—dregs of Rome,— Hungry as hounds, and merciless as wolves, To gorge upon us.— CATILINE. And they left you bare? ARMINIUS. Stript to the bone! DUMNORIX. Our fields are desolate, Loaded with mortgage and hard usury. For wine and oil they bear the loathsome weed— Nightshades and darnels, docks and matted furze. The plain is now a marsh, breathing blue steams, That kill the flock; the blossom'd hill a heath; The valley, and the vineyard, loneliness; Where the rare traveller sees but mouldering graves, And hears but brayings of the mountain deer, That come, unscared, to wanton in the stream. ARMINIUS (despondingly). We have no arms! There's not a spear-head left In all Helvetia. CATILINE (with ardour). Have you no ploughshares, scythes? When men are brave, the sickle is a spear! Must Freedom pine till the slow armourer Gilds her caparison, and sends her out To glitter and play antics in the sun? Let hearts be what they ought,—the naked earth Will be their magazine;—the rocks—the trees— Nay—there's no idle and unnoted thing, But, in the hand of Valour, will out-thrust The spear, and make the mail a mockery. ARMINIUS. Come to our altar. Drink the sacred pledge:— There lie our kingly emblems, that we brought [Pointing to the axe and helmet. In bitterness, for tribute. They are yours; Our blood is yours. CATILINE (taking the goblet). Here's a bold health to freedom! DUMNORIX (interposing). This is too rash—too wild. We must implore Our native goddess. ARMINIUS. Let your hymn be free; Speak out your hearts to Heaven.— Heaven scorns a slave! HYMN. (Chaunted by the Priests, &amp;c. &amp;c.) Thou, whose throne is on the cloud, Mighty Mother of the sky! Clothe thee in thy darkest shroud, Come, with terror in thine eye! Stoop, a nation's cry to hear, Goddess of the mountaineer! On the hills our life is pour'd, We have perish'd in the vale; With our blood the stream is gored, With our groans is swell'd the gale. Tyranny has bound the chain On our bosom and our brain. What has crush'd our ancient glory? Rome, by thee the deed was done! What has bid our chieftains hoary To a nameless grave begone? What has from its kingly stand Smote the spirit of the land? Where was once a prouder spear? Where was once a bolder brow? When Helvetia's mountaineer Thunder'd on the realms below! Never keener shaft from string Tore the Roman eagle's wing. Goddess! give,—we ask no more, 'Tis the boon thou givest the brave,— Freedom! in the Roman's gore, Or in old Helvetia's grave! Destiny and chance are thine; Answer, Goddess, thrice divine! [As the Chaunt ceases, a low sound of Thunder, followed by remote Music, is heard. ARMINIUS (to CATILINE). That is the signal when the prophetess Gives the responses. She's a wond'rous one, A Grecian, from Dodona. She has slept In the Trophonian Cave,—and stood, 'tis said, At Delphi, on the tripod. DUMNORIX. Hush! She comes! [The Curtains of the Recess open with a burst of light; Priests and Females, with laurel Wreaths, come forward to Music. Aspasia, the Prophetess, advances with an augural Staff, and crowned with Laurel. After a pause of thought, she bursts out into Recitation, accompanied by faint Music. RECITATION. ASPASIA. Heard you not the earthquake's thunder? Hark! the depths are rent asunder. See! the Furies in their cave, Sitting by a new-made grave: Fix'd as stone, the upward lightning Round their eyes of paleness bright'ning, Fire their crowns; the outstretch'd hand Sceptred with the funeral brand. CHORUS. Mighty Mother of the sky, Hear a suppliant nation's cry! RECITATION. ASPASIA. The grave is blood; a banner'd host Are at its side,—plunged in, and lost. A mighty people touch its verge; Within the crimson flood they merge; A golden helm, an axe, a throne, Gleam through the tossing surge,—they're gone! Through the cavern, laugh and yell Shut the Furies' fearful spell. CHORUS. Mighty Mother, &amp;c. [Aspasia turns, and gazes on Catiline. The prayer is heard! within the cave Who stands? The bravest of the brave! He strikes! The Stygian sisters fly, The gulf of blood has lost its dye. In shadowy lustre from its tide Arise the buried—purified! Last gleam the helm, the axe, the throne— And he is King—that glorious One! [The Priests, &amp;c. bend before Catiline. DUMNORIX. Hail!—King of Gaul! CHORUS chaunt, Hail!—King of Gaul! [Aspasia takes the axe and helmet. ARMINIUS (to CATILINE). Now to the field!—The mountain horn shall ring, And every Alp shall answer;—hollow caves, And the dim forest-depths, and beds untracked Of the eternal snows, shall teem with tribes That know no Roman tyrants,—daring hearts, Swift feet, strong hands, that neither hunger, thirst, Nor winter cataracts, nor the tempest's roar, When the hills shake with thunderbolts, can tire. [Aspasia lays the helmet on Catiline's head, and places the axe in his hand. The Chorus chaunt, “Hail, King of Gaul!” The Scene closes. END OF THE SECOND ACT. ACT III. SCENE I. An Apartment in a Cottage, in the Roman Suburb. Aspasia sitting, listening anxiously; a female Attendant, with a Distaff, at a Table; a Lyre, a laurel Chaplet, and Scrolls of Music in different Parts of the Room. An open Casement. Night. ASPASIA. The hour's gone by. But, hark!—He comes at last. No! 't was the whisper of the cheating wind. When he returns, he shall not have a word; And I'll sit thus, half turn'd away, and hide My face; till he has woo'd my hand from it, And called me Dian, lingering for her love; Or Ariadne, weeping by the wave, That show'd the Athenian's galley like a speck; Or Sappho, all enamour'd, full of dreams, Gazing upon her sea-grave ere she died. For such fond punishments are food to love. I cannot sit, nor rest in mind, nor think.— [She rises. He left me,—but he loves me,—he'll return: Yet there was strangeness in his eye—a flash That died in sudden gloom; his parting kiss Was given as wildly as 't were given by lips That parted for the scaffold. [Listening. Hark! 'tis he! I'd know his step among a thousand. Hush! [To the Attendant. Give me that lyre, Campaspe, and begone. [Aspasia plays, turning from the door. Hamilcar enters. She ceases. HAMILCAR (joyously). Play on, fair Greek; but let it be some song That has a triumph in 't,—a kingliness,— Let it discourse of crowns. ASPASIA. Why did you stay? HAMILCAR. You are a Circe. Last night's prophecy Has turn'd the brains of the Allobroges; I come, to thank you for 't.—Their spell is sure!— You shall be rich. ASPASIA. Aye, in my early grave. HAMILCAR. No; ere those lips are riper by a week. [He points to the Casement. Look! where the Ethiop beauty, Night, comes forth, Veiling her forehead in thick woven clouds; But soon shall all her glory be disclosed, From her pale sandal, silver'd by the moon, To her starr'd turban! She's your emblem, girl! Look on these gems! [He throws jewels into her lap. ASPASIA. All presents are but pain To slighted fondness.—Take your jewels back. [She repels them. HAMILCAR (exultingly). You shall have all that ever sparkled yet, And of the rarest. Not an Afric king Shall wear one that you love. The Persian's brow, And the swart Emperor's by the Indian stream, Shall wane beside you: you shall be a blaze Of rubies, your lips' rivals; topazes, Like solid sunbeams; moony opals; pearls, Fit to be ocean's lamps; brown hyacinths, Lost only in your tresses; chrysolites, Transparent gold; diamonds, like new-shot stars, Or brighter—like those eyes: you shall have all, That ever lurk'd in Eastern mine, or paved With light the treasure-chambers of the sea. ASPASIA (gazing on him). You startle me; you have grown thin of late; There's an unnatural rapture in your speech— Fire on your lips, but death in your sunk eye. HAMILCAR. Death!—at this moment I could face a lion! I have the giant strength of hope. ASPASIA. Of hope? The icicle, that melts, even in the ray In which it glitters. HAMILCAR. Things are now afoot, That shall shake hearts like fearful prodigies; Strip the patrician's robe from many a back, And give it to his slave; make beggars rich, And rich men beggars; drag authority Down on its knees; they'll wake your commonwealth With a last thunder-peal. ASPASIA (in astonishment). Some treason's here! [Aside. Hamilcar, where's this wonder to be done? In Africa? HAMILCAR. No! ASPASIA. Is 't in yonder clouds? HAMILCAR. In Rome!—The word's let loose! (aside). [He draws his poniard. Young traitress, swear, Upon this dagger, that my idle word Dies on your lips;—'t is your own cause, fair spy,— Wait but a week—you shall have palaces! ASPASIA. This cottage is but homely— HAMILCAR. 'T is a den! Your halls shall be a pile of gorgeousness; Tapestry of India; Tyrian canopies; Heroic bronzes; pictures, half divine, Apelles' pencil; statues, that the Greek Has wrought to living beauty; amethyst urns, And onyx, essenced with the Persian rose; Couches of mother-pearl, and tortoise shell; Crystalline mirrors; tables, in which gems Make the mosaic; cups of argentry, Thick with immortal sculptures:—all that wealth Has dazzling, rare, delicious,—or the sword Of conquerors can master, shall be yours. ASPASIA. Those are wild words, my prince! HAMILCAR. Words, true as Jove! You shall be glorious!—Ay, this little hand Shall, in its slender white, a sceptre bear:— On this smooth brow, fair as young Cupid's wing, Shall glitter the rich circle of a crown; Catching your beauty's splendours, like a cloud Above the bright pavilion of the morn. ASPASIA (doubtingly). 'T is fancy's revel! HAMILCAR. No, my nymph of Greece! I feel the sudden and delighted blood Swelling my heart—dear, as to sickness health— Home to the exile—freedom to the slave— Light to the blind! Am I not by my queen? ASPASIA. When will the dream be up? HAMILCAR (loftily). When I am king! ASPASIA (she weeps). Oh! Semele! HAMILCAR. In tears! What melts you now? Such tears are folly. ASPASIA. 'T was a wandering thought. HAMILCAR (sternly). Let it have speech, and die. ASPASIA. It was of one,— Your brow looks gentler now,—who loved—a king! HAMILCAR. Then comes the worn-out moral—She was scorn'd! ASPASIA. Too much he loved her! 'T is an ancient tale, One of the ditties that our girls of Greece Hear from their careful mothers, round the lamps, On winter nights; and by the vintage urns, When grapes are crushing. I have seen the spot, Still ashy-pale with lightning, where she died.— She was a Grecian maiden; and, by some, Was thought a daughter of the sky; for earth Had never shaped such beauty: and her thoughts Were, like her beauty, sky-born. She would stray, And gaze, when morn was budding on the hills, As if she saw the stooping pomp of gods— Then tell her lyre the vision; nor had eve A sound, or rosy colour of the clouds, Or infant star, but in her solemn songs It lived again. Oh, happy—till she loved! HAMILCAR. By Cupid, no—not happy until then! Say on. ASPASIA. But may not love be misery? HAMILCAR. So would the shower, but that the sun will come. ASPASIA. And must we have no sun without the shower? HAMILCAR. The spring is sweeter for the winter's wind. ASPASIA. But does the winter never blight the spring? Oh! I could give you fact and argument, Brought from all earth—all life—all history;— O'erwhelm you with sad tales, convictions strong, Till you could hate it;—tell of gentle lives, Light as the lark's upon the morning cloud, Struck down, at once, by the keen shaft of Love; Of hearts, that flow'd like founts of happiness, Dried into dust by the wild flame of love; Of maiden beauty, wasting all away, Like a departing vision into air, Love filling her sweet eyes with midnight tears, Till death upon its bosom pillow'd her; Of noble natures sour'd; rich minds obscured; High hopes turn'd blank; nay, of the kingly crown Mouldering amid the embers of the throne;— And all by Love. We paint him as a child,— When he should sit, a giant on his clouds, The great disturbing spirit of the world! HAMILCAR. Thou cunning Greek, the ruby on thy lips Is deeper with the tale. 'Tis the true red, He tips his arrows with. Yes; turn away!— There is a death to wisdom in those eyes. ASPASIA (bending before him). Speak to me thus, and I will be Love's slave; I'll build him altars,—he shall have all flowers Of vale, or hill, or fountain,—and all fruits, That melt in autumn's baskets; nay, the gold Of Hesperus' garden were too slight a gift To honour him. We'll never part again.— I have forgot of what I talk'd just now. HAMILCAR. Of Semele, fair Greek. ASPASIA. The tale is done. She met a stately hunter on the hills,— Loved him, and wedded him: and passion's flame, That had bewitch'd her loneliness, now burn'd Richer in Hymen's lamp. But, one night came, And with it came no husband,—and she wept;— Another, and she knelt to the cold moon, Praying, in pain, the mother's deity, That she might show him but his babe, and die. The thunder peal'd at midnight, and he came— And then she fell upon his neck, and kiss'd, And ask'd him, why he left her desolate? His brow grew cloudy,—but at last she wrung The lofty secret— HAMILCAR. Woman's ancient arts! The tale sounds true. ASPASIA. Of his inconstancy? HAMILCAR. No; of her sex's teazing. Girl, say on; Your voice has music in 't. She conquer'd him? ASPASIA. He was a god; and to his throne in the stars He must at times ascend. She dared not doubt: But love will have wild thoughts; and so, she pined, And her rich cheek grew pale. HAMILCAR. With jealousy? ASPASIA. To prove his truth, at length, she bade him come In his full glory. HAMILCAR. And the lover came? ASPASIA. He long denied her,—offer'd her all wealth, Of mine or mountain,—kiss'd away her tears,— All to subdue her thought. HAMILCAR. And all in vain! Was she not woman! ASPASIA. Pity her! 'twas Love That wrought this evil to his worshipper! The deadly oath was sworn.—Then nature shook, As in strange trouble,—solemn cries were heard, Echoing from hill to hill,—the forests bowed, Ruddy with lightnings,—in the height of heaven The moon grew sanguine, and the waning stars Fell loosely through the sky. Before her rose, On golden clouds, a throne; and, at its foot, An eagle grasp'd the thunderbolt. The face Of the bright sitter on the throne was bent Over his sceptre,—but she knew her lord! And call'd upon him but to give one look, Before she perish'd in th'Olympian blaze. He raised his eye,—and in its flash—she died! HAMILCAR. Those are old fables. You shall be a queen! Numidia's queen! Throned by my side—your steps Shall be on gold dust;—pards and lions chain'd Shall draw your chariot:—you shall have a host Of vassal monarchs flashing round your march, Like living towers of gems. [He points to the Casement. Look there! the hour is written in the sky. Jove rushes down on Saturn:—'tis the sign Of war throughout the nations. In the east The Crescent sickens;—and the purple star, Perseus, the Ioanian's love, lifts up his crest, And o'er her stands exulting! ASPASIA. The pole is set to midnight. HAMILCAR. Would 't were come! I think that time has stopt. Sweep on, ye orbs!— There was no deeper torture in all hell Than his, who turn'd upon the fiery wheel, Rolling, yet fix'd for ever! [He starts up. Loose my hands! This night has heavy business. Fate's at work! ASPASIA (weeping and clinging to him). Where would you go?—You have not told me yet. I'll never part with you.—You go to die! HAMILCAR. My death's not made for Rome! ASPASIA (suddenly). Let's fly at once:— Cast off the desperate business of the dark, And see to-morrow's sun rise on the sea, The happiest of all exiles! HAMILCAR (trying to disengage himself). Sweet—farewell! ASPASIA. To Greece—to Greece! We shall be light of heart, As birds in summer skies: fond, as two doves, That have escaped the fowler's cruel snare; Our vine and myrtle fence shall be a bound, That earth's pale vanities, its hatreds, fears, Fiery ambitions, pining discontents, Dare not o'erleap: and we'll have dance and song, And hymn the sun with touches of the lyre, As morning sows with pearl the Athenian hills. And we will wander by the evening shore, And hear the mellow music of the waves, And read strange fortunes in the speckled sands, And make sweet pictures in the crimson clouds; Telling the story of our travel past, Till the day sinks, forgotten in our talk, And Hesper's twinkling lamp must light us home. HAMILCAR. I shall return.—By all the golden dreams Of royalty! ASPASIA (hanging on him). But swear—that you will come. HAMILCAR (taking her hand, and pressing it to his lips). By this white hand, thus shook with such sweet fear; By the deliciousness of this droop'd eye; By the red witchery of this trembling lip; By all the charm of woman's weeping love. ASPASIA. Here will I stand, until my lord comes back, Like Memory's statue on the grave of Love! HAMILCAR. You shall be Memory, living Memory, Gazing upon the spot i'the clouds, where Love, Fresh crown'd, shall on his swiftest wing descend. ASPASIA (despondingly). You will be slain. HAMILCAR. I will return—this night! [He draws a paper from his bosom. Still unbelieving!—Woman, read my heart, Writ in this scroll. Earth has no deeper pledge: But keep it like the apple of your eye. If it is seen, the death of one—or both, Is sure as destiny.—(He embraces her.)—Once more—farewell! [Exit. ASPASIA (opening the scroll). What have we here? Oh, Juno! 'tis in blood! A list of names:—a plot against the state. This was the pageant in the cave last night! The helmet on that Roman's brow.—(Reads)—“Plunder,—massacre— Troops from Apulia—Spain!” If it should fail!— 'Tis madness, and must fail. He shall be saved! For all his wildness and proud fantasies, I love him!—Now to Cicero! [Exit. SCENE II. THE SENATE HOUSE. The Temple of Jupiter Stator. The Senate at night; a Consul in the Chair; Cicero on the Floor, concluding his Speech. CICERO. Our long debate must close. Take one proof more Of this rebellion.—Lucius Catiline Has been commanded to attend the Senate. He dares not come. I now demand your votes;— Is he condemn'd to exile? [Catiline comes in hastily, and flings himself on the Bench; all the Senators go over to the other Side. CICERO turns to CATILINE. Here I repeat the charge, to gods and men, Of treasons manifold;—that, but this day, He has received despatches from the rebels— That he has leagued with deputies from Gaul To seize the province; nay, has levied troops, And raised the rebel standard;—that, but now A meeting of conspirators was held Under his roof, with mystic rites, and oaths, Pledged round the body of a murder'd slave. To those he has no answer. CATILINE (rising calmly). Conscript Fathers! I do not rise to waste the night in words: Let that plebeian talk; 'tis not my trade; But here I stand for right. Let him show proofs,— For Roman right; though none, it seems, dare stand To take their share with me. Ay, cluster there, Cling to your master; judges, Romans,—slaves! His charge is false;—I dare him to his proofs, You have my answer now! I must be gone. CICERO. Bring back the helmet of this Gaulish king! [The Lictors return with the helmet and axe. These, as I told you, were this evening seized Within his house. You know them, Catiline? CATILINE. The axe and helmet of the Allobroges! (aside.) Know them; What crimination's there? What tongue Lives in that helm to charge me? Cicero— Go search my house, you may find twenty such; All fairly struck from brows of barbarous kings, When you and yours were plotting here in Rome. I say, go search my house. And is this all? I scorn to tell you by what chance they came. Where have I levied troops—tamper'd with slaves— Bribed fool or villain, to embark his neck In this rebellion? Let my actions speak. CICERO (interrupting him). Deeds shall convince you! Has the traitor done? CATILINE. But this I will avow, that I have scorn'd, And still do scorn, to hide my sense of wrong. Not he who brands my forehead, breaks my sword, Or lays the bloody scourge upon my back, Can wrong me half so much as he who shuts The gates of honour on me,—turning out The Roman from his birthright; and for what?— [Looking round him. To fling your offices to every slave;— Vipers, that creep where man disdains to climb; And having wound their loathsome track to the top Of this huge mouldering monument of Rome, Hang hissing at the nobler man below. CICERO. This is his answer! Must I bring more proofs? Fathers, you know there lives not one of us, But lives in peril of his midnight sword. Lists of proscription have been handed round, In which your general properties are made Your murderers' hire. Bring in the prisoners. [The Lictors return with Cethegus, and others. CATILINE (startled). Cethegus! (aside.) CICERO. Fathers! those stains to their high name and blood, Came to my house to murder me; and came Suborn'd by him. CATILINE (scornfully). Cethegus! Did you say this? CETHEGUS. Not I.—I went to kill A prating, proud plebeian, whom those fools Palm'd on the Consulship. CICERO. And sent by whom? CETHEGUS. By none.—By nothing, but my zeal to purge The senate of yourself, most learned Cicero! [A cry is heard without: “More Prisoners! The Allobroges!” An Officer enters, with Letters for Cicero; who, after glancing at them, sends them round the Senate. Catiline is strongly perturbed. The Allobroges come in, chained. CICERO. Fathers of Rome! If man can be convinced By proof, as clear as day-light, there it stands! [Pointing to the prisoners. Those men have been arrested at the gates, Bearing despatches to raise war in Gaul. Look on these letters! Here's a deep laid plot To wreck the provinces: a solemn league, Made with all form and circumstance. The time Is desperate,—all the slaves are up;—Rome shakes!— The Heavens alone can tell how near our graves We stand ev'n here!—The name of Catiline Is foremost in the league. He was their king. Tried and convicted traitor, go from Rome! CATILINE (haughtily, rising). Come, consecrated lictors! from your thrones; [To the Senate. Fling down your sceptres:—take the rod and axe, And make the murder as you make the law. CICERO (interrupting him). Give up the record of his banishment. [To an Officer. [The Officer gives it to the Consul, in the chair. CATILINE (indignantly). Banish'd from Rome! What's banish'd, but set free From daily contact of the things I loathe? ‘Tried and convicted traitor!’ Who says this? [With growing violence. Who'll prove it, at his peril, on my head? Banish'd?—I thank you for 't. It breaks my chain! I held some slack allegiance till this hour— But now my sword's my own. Smile on, my lords; I scorn to count what feelings, wither'd hopes, Strong provocations, bitter, burning wrongs, I have within my heart's hot cells shut up, To leave you in your lazy dignities. But here I stand and scoff you:—here I fling Hatred and full defiance in your face. Your Consul's merciful.—For this all thanks. He dares not touch a hair of Catiline. (The Consul reads) “Lucius Sergius Catiline; by the decree of the Senate, you are declared an enemy and an alien to the state, and banished from the territory of the commonwealth.” THE CONSUL. Lictors, drive the traitor from the temple! CATILINE (furious). ‘Traitor!’ I go—but I return. This—trial! Here I devote your Senate! I've had wrongs, To stir a fever in the blood of age, Or make the infant's sinew strong as steel. This day's the birth of sorrows!—This hour's work Will breed Proscriptions.—Look to your hearths, my lords! For there henceforth shall sit, for household gods, Shapes hot from Tartarus!—all shames and crimes;— Wan Treachery, with his thirsty dagger drawn; Suspicion, poisoning the brother's cup; Naked Rebellion, with the torch and axe, Making his wild sport of your blazing thrones; Till Anarchy comes down on you like Night, And Massacre seals Rome's eternal grave! THE SENATORS rise in tumult, and cry out, Go, enemy and parricide, from Rome! CATILINE (indignantly). It shall be so!—(Going. He suddenly returns.)—When Catiline comes again, Your grandeur shall be base, and clowns shall sit In scorn upon those chairs;—your palaces Shall see the soldier's revels, and your wealth Shall go to deck his harlot and his horse. Then Cicero, and his tools, shall pay me blood— Vengeance for every drop of my boy's veins;— And such of you, as cannot find the grace To die with swords in your right hands, shall feel The life, life worse than death, of trampled slaves! THE SENATORS cry out, Go, enemy and parricide, from Rome! CICERO. Expel him, lictors! Clear the senate-house! [They surround him. CATILINE (struggling through them). I go,—but not to leap the gulf alone: I go;—but when I come—'t will be the burst Of ocean in the earthquake—rolling back In swift and mountainous ruin. Fare you well!— You build my funeral pile, but your best blood Shall quench its flame. Back, slaves! (to the Lictors)—I will return! [He rushes through the portal; the Scene closes. END OF THE THIRD ACT. ACT IV. SCENE I. An Apartment in Cicero's Palace. Attendants. A Secretary at a Table. Cicero is walking in front, occasionally speaking to the Officers. CICERO. The night is stormy! Has the guard been set? [To a Centurion. Send out a squadron to the Esquiline; All stragglers must be seized. [The Officer goes. Strange lights, you say, [To another. Were seen towards Veii: Manlius must have moved. Bring in your prisoner. (To another.) [He walks about thoughtfully. And this is my supremacy! The prize That whets men's swords, and sows in noble hearts The bitter seed of discord! Sir! see here [To the Secretary. The cheerless image of a statesman's life! To bear upon his brow the general care,— To make his daily food of anxious thoughts, To rob the midnight of its wholesome sleep,— And all, but to be made the loftier mark For every shaft that envy, sullen hate, Or thwarted guilt, can lay upon the string,— And have his thanks for all,—ingratitude! HAMILCAR enters, chained. HAMILCAR. My lord Dictator,—I have to complain Of insult from your officers. Why these chains? Why am I dragg'd, at midnight, through the streets? I claim to be Rome's hostage,—not her slave! CICERO. Sir, clear the chamber. [To an Officer. Moor, you are arraign'd [To Hamilcar. Of treason to the majesty of Rome. No frowning here!—A Roman wastes his time, In reasoning with barbarians! Whips shall wring Confession from you. Tell the truth at once. HAMILCAR. Send for your lictors; bring the scourge and screw: I laugh at torture! CICERO (sternly). All your steps are known,— You have been leagued with Catiline;—your share, When this wild work was done, and Rome in flames, Should be Numidia. HAMILCAR (haughtily). Call the torturers in,— Try if I writhe. I stir up war in Rome! What am I here? An alien! captive! stript Of wealth and dignity! My tribes Rome's slaves,— My sceptre in her hands!—Conspirator!— If I could war by piling up the waves, Or make my soldiers of the shifting sands, I might be worth your chains. CICERO. Look on this scroll! [Showing him the list. So! it has struck you! Do you know these names? Glance at the bottom, Moor,—there's one name left, That you might know. That traitor was, it seems, To fire my palace. HAMILCAR. Some poor forgery,— [Flinging it down. A trick to frighten dastards!—Bring the scourge. CICERO. You shall have agonies! (Calls) The torturer! [Aspasia is brought forward. HAMILCAR (in astonishment). Aspasia! CICERO. Greek, who gave you this? HAMILCAR (rushing forward). 'Twas I! Where are your dungeons? CICERO. Traitor, before morn Your head is on the scaffold. ASPASIA (kneeling to CICERO). Mighty lord! Spare him!—Is this your promise before Heaven? Hamilcar, speak one word. [Turning and kneeling to him. CICERO. He is undone! ASPASIA. One word will save us both. The hour you die, I scorn to live. HAMILCAR (to ASPASIA). Deceiver! let me die, Rather than live dishonour'd. CICERO. Prince, the grief Of noble hearts for crime is honour's self.— We must delay no longer,—all is known,— Your full confession were not worth the breath That gave it utterance. ASPASIA. Die for Catiline? CICERO. Why not? The captive for his conqueror. Twas he that dragg'd the African to Rome. HAMILCAR (agitated). 'Tis not forgot,—'tis writ upon my heart, To wipe away that shame!—I had resolved To wait till he was emperor here, and then To stab him on his throne! CICERO (urgently). Take vengeance now! If you have nature's current in your veins,— If you have honour for your ancestors,— If there be aught of human or divine, That can awake the soul to just revenge, They all command you. You will be the praise Of Rome; and when the warrior's memory Lies in his grave,—yours shall be pedestal'd In nations' hearts! ASPASIA (kneeling to him). Hamilcar, look upon me. By the faith That I have borne you in my loneliness,— By woman's love, that masters death,—but speak!— I have betray'd you; and your noble blood Sits heavy on my soul. Speak, or I die. CICERO. Rise, woman; the barbarian's heartless,—bound In treason, stronger than those iron links. HAMILCAR (indignantly). Turn traitor to my friends? CICERO. The truest friend To Catiline is he that lets the axe Fall on his weary life!—The epicure, Who sleeps in luxury's lap; who wears no robe, But from the silk-worm's loom; suffers no air To come beneath his nostrils, but the breath Of incense, and the aromatic herbs That Indian princes pillow on; even he May love the subtle-frowning messenger, That comes to close his pleasure-pamper'd life: But here it comes, a palpable discharge Of pain and emptiness,—remission quick Of all the ills that break down bankrupt life, Kindly exchange for shame, grief, flat despair! HAMILCAR. Slay me at once,—strike here! [Baring his breast. CICERO (calls to the Secretary). Ho! Capito! Give me the letter that was found to-night In Catiline's house. [Looks at the letter. A claim from Lentulus, That, when all 's done, this priestess shall be thrown Into his share of the spoil. [Aspasia falls into Hamilcar's arms. HAMILCAR (grasping at the letter). Villains!—Is 't true? CICERO. You see his seal. HAMILCAR (raging). To Tartarus with my oath! They all shall die! That spoil shall never be,— They meet to-night!—The whole conspiracy! CICERO (startled). Where? in the Palatine? at Læca's house? HAMILCAR. No!—In the Marian Vault—in arms! CICERO. In arms!— Summon the magistrates;—send couriers out [To the Secretary. To Veii for the legion;—bid the knights Keep all their chargers saddled. HAMILCAR (wildly). Let me have A cohort, and I'll take them—in the fact.— Dividers of the spoil before 'tis won!— They would have robb'd me,—trampled on my heart,— Left me to wail, and howl, and gnash my teeth, When I had done their drudgery! There's not one, From first to last, but shall be in this hall, Within an hour,—in chains! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Dungeon. Cethegus manacled. He rises from the Pavement. CETHEGUS. Will morning never come? This vault is cold, And has the smell of charnels. There 's a bed For limbs that slept on silk.—What desperate thoughts Have been re-echoed by these scowling walls! This track was worn by steps of misery!— [Looking at the ground. Oh, had these stones a tongue! How many a day My chariot wheels have rattled o'er this vault, Startling the wretch below! The difference now Is even! 'Tis a world of straws. (Listening.) They come! Here they shall butcher me;—I'll not be made A scaffold spectacle!—I saw a sword Within the farther cell. If I must die, It shall be—fighting. [He goes in. [Catiline, Valerius, and others, enter hastily, with swords drawn, and torches. CATILINE (calls). Hallo! Cethegus! VALERIUS. He has been slain. Here's blood! [Looking at the ground. CATILINE. 'T is old! [A noise within. Lift up your torch. CETHEGUS (rushing in with a sword). Now, murderers! which of you will buy my life? [They recognize him. CATILINE. Off with his chains,—we have no time to lose. VALERIUS (to CETHEGUS). We've kill'd the guard. CETHEGUS. Good friends, and true! [Taking a paper from the rock. Take this,— [To Catiline. 'T was thrust into my hand when I was brought Before the Senate. CATILINE. (Reads) “Be firm; we are your friends, and friends to Catiline. (Signed) “Crassus and Cæsar.” [With frantic exultation. Then Rome is ours! These names are victory!— This dungeon's hot.—What time is't o'the night?— The Senate's pillows shall be red by morn! Away now with the scabbard! War's let loose! My falchion shall give law;—I'll have all Rome Kissing the dust before my horse's hoof.— Revenge! swift, full, and bloody!—(To Valerius.) Sir, your hand! VALERIUS. Your touch is fever. CATILINE (to the rest). Hunt the city through: Summon our friends!—Tell them the time is come, That they have long'd for!—That I'm roused at last! Break up their banquets,—shake them from their beds.— Torches and swords!—We'll storm the Capitol! [He looks at the list. What characters are these, thus writ with flame?— [He turns away, musing. To smite the proud accuser in the teeth,— Strip pale Hypocrisy, and show the world The heart within its cloak,—teach Scorn to weep,— Trample the trampler,—in the zealot's face Fling his own brand,—root out the slanderer's tongue!— Does not the chamber shake?—Look there—look there! [Tottering, and pointing to the ground. VALERIUS (supporting him). His trouble has exhausted him. CETHEGUS (assisting). He faints. CATILINE (starting up, and still pointing to the ground.) Do you see nothing? CETHEGUS. Take him into the air. CATILINE. No grave?—no giant form, laid at its length? Look—look—it rises—Marius in his mail!— [As to a vision. Thou mightiest and most awful summoner! Death's majesty,—life's terror,—that hast come, Passing the gates that none can see and live! Is not thy visitation gracious?—Hark! He groans,—and, with a fearful heaviness, His eye is cast upon the earth:—but speak!— Great spectre, Demi-god!—I know thou'rt come, To give our lingering swords the lightning's edge, And put a soul in our too nerveless flesh, Fit for Rome's final slaughter?—Answer me!— He will not speak!—Then, Demon! by thy bed In burning hell, what wrath of fate is theirs, Who war against their country?—See! he frowns,— His eye grows meteor-like,—he rends his mail,— And, with his dagger, stabs his naked breast! [He falls into their arms. VALERIUS. Bear him away,—in mercy! CATILINE (bursting from them, as following the vision). He rises, darkening all the air!—He's gone! [He falls—the Scene closes. SCENE III. The Sepulchre of the Marian Family. A large vaulted Hall. The chief Tomb in the distance. Tombs at the sides, with Arms piled on them. Roman Nobles in the military Dress; some sitting with Dice and Wine— some sleeping on the Ground, and the Tombs. The Silver Eagle in front, veiled. Lentulus, Cecina, and others, in front of all, conversing. Sounds of gaming and merriment in the distance. CECINA. Has the cock crow'd? LENTULUS (to CECINA). Go, stop those clamorous fools! We shall be heard: they've drank and gamed all night. [Hamilcar enters. What news brings my Numidian? HAMILCAR. Has Catiline come? I saw some sudden stir In the Palatine. CURIUS (reeling forward from a drinking group). A marriage or carouse? HAMILCAR. At first some torches wander'd on the roof Of the state prison, but they soon went down,— And, as I left the suburb, twice, or thrice, I heard a trumpet sound. LENTULUS (in alarm). 'T was for the knights! CURIUS. Ho! Emperor Lentulus, do you shake already? It was a jovial riot, I'll be sworn! [A knocking without. LENTULUS. Look to the portal. All be on your guard. [The Patricians come forward tumultuously, with their swords drawn. HAMILCAR (listening). 'T is Catiline's voice! CECINA. He never was more welcome. This is the coldest of all sepulchres. [Catiline, Valerius, Cethegus, and others, enter. The Patricians cry out, “Hail, Catiline!” CATILINE. Good auspices, my lords! LENTULUS. Our midnight work Is well begun. Your coming makes all sure. [Catiline, Cethegus, and Lentulus, pass down the Vault, with Maps and Lists in their hands. VALERIUS (looking after Catiline). His look is strange! CECINA. Like one that had seen ghosts! How Lentulus sinks to nothing in his frown! VALERIUS. He's desperately changed. More than I thought Misfortune could have done in twice the time. CATILINE (returning). The night's far gone. LENTULUS. Must the blow fall to-night? CATILINE. Heavy and home, my lords! All's ready here? [A general cry of “All!” CATILINE. A legion lies at Veii;—we must strike Before it comes. Give me the plan of the city. [The Patricians stand round him. Annius, your spearmen, with the cavalry, Will halt in column by the Milvian Bridge. Fulvius Nobilior, you will flank the gates Leading to Veii. Lucius Scævola, Your place is with the veterans, by the road Below the Esquiline. Six cohorts, then, Are left to seize the Forum. None must stir Till you see blazes from the Consul's roof; Where I, with Lentulus, and the Marian troops, Begin the business. CURIUS. 'T is a tough night's work! What pay's to glue my sword-hilt to my hand? CATILINE. Glue it with blood. SECOND PATRICIAN. A proper question, too. Aye;—what's our hire for knocking out our brains? CATILINE (turning on them fiercely). Just what they're worth, fool! Now, by the infernal gods, Ye are enough to madden me! What pay?— Are ye not beggars, outcasts, rebels, slaves; Crush'd to the earth with debt, neck-deep in ruin; Lean spendthrifts, shatter'd gamblers, mortgagers, Down to the very sandals on your feet? Are ye not this to-night? and, by to-morrow, May ye not be— LENTULUS (interrupting him). I must be king of Rome! CATILINE (contemptuously). You shall be—ten times king, or what you will. Give me the map. (He takes it.) Here lies the whole wide earth: And in this narrow vault I see earth's lords; The kings of all its kingdoms. We stand here, Thus buried—thus in midnight,—more sublime— A mightier proof and triumph of man's mind, Than if we dozed away our lives on gold.— All power is in our hands:—the earthquake's here, That, bursting, shall shake Rome;—the thunder's here, That, from its darkness, shall set Earth on fire.— Here stand we, like the majesty of Jove, Awake, while the world sleeps, preparing wrath,— Unheard, unseen, unknown, invincible! LENTULUS. What's for yourself? CATILINE (furiously). Revenge!—on all in Rome. They've made me desperate;—let them watch to-night;— By Pluto, what they've made me, they shall find me. Let them expel me now.—Blood and revenge! [A noise is heard without. CECINA (to HAMILCAR). Did you hear that? It seem'd a clash of arms. HAMILCAR (contemptuously). 'T was nothing! CECINA. 'T was beside us!—There—again!— HAMILCAR. 'T was but the creaking of the portal gates, As the wind freshens towards the morn. [Catiline advances to the Eagle; the Patricians surround it. CATILINE. Here, my lords of Rome! Do homage.—On this javelin's summit dwells The heart of Rome's first warrior.—Marius' heart:— The hour that sees it at our army's head, Sees triumph. SECOND PATRICIAN (riotously). Marius for our omen! No— He fined me in the senate. Who's for Sylla? CETHEGUS (springing forwards with his sword drawn). Who's for that hoary hypocrite? Come on! [A tumult. CATILINE (striking down their swords). Cethegus! at your brawls again?—Swords, too! Back, Curius! He that but frowns first shall die. [Turning away indignantly. This is the curse of all conspiracy, To mingle with the refuse of our kind,— To be the tool of tools, the slave of slaves,— To patch up ruffian quarrel:—from his cups To drag the dozing drunkard;—tear the knife From the assassin's hand;—stir up the base To manly thoughts; degrade the swelling heart To necessary villains, that the eye Had loathed in day-light. Oh, Conspiracy! To this disgrace thou'st damn'd me;—ay, and all That ever sank to thee!—Go to your homes; Go, and be strangled! Traitors!—I'll die here. HAMILCAR (suddenly grasping the Eagle). Who dares to linger? Here towers victory; Spirit of him, whose heart sits on this spear, In life and death our leader in the field; Hear, from the golden throne where Hebe gives The nectar to thy lip among the stars!— By all the immortal urns of light above; By all the altars of the kneeling earth; By all the rulers of the central fire; Standard and shrine, I swear to follow thee! Through sunshine and through storm; through height and depth; Through the red desert; through the raging sea; Through frost and fire; through steel and talisman!— CETHEGUS (taking the standard). Through hunger, thirst, wounds, sorrow, scorn, and shame! CATILINE (taking the standard; a noise is heard without). What tumult's there? Look to the gate, Hamilcar. [He goes. Through conflagration—Roman massacre! [Solemnly. [A Shout; the Gates are burst open by Soldiery; the Conspirators fight, and are repulsed. Catiline and Cethegus fight their way to the Portal. Cethegus forces him out, as he struggles to return. CETHEGUS. Away, away! To Manlius! To the camp! [The scene closes. END OF THE FOURTH ACT. ACT V. SCENE I. The Procession of the Conspirators to Death. Night. The Forum, by Torchlight, lined with Troops. A Range of Scaffolds in the distance, with Executioners; the Multitude crowding round them; distant Trumpets sounding from time to time; the Way from the Palatine, by the Via Sacra, illuminated; People in the Balconies and on the Roofs; a rush of the Citizens to the front of the Stage; distant Shouts. FIRST MAN. Those shouts are for the Consul. Clear the way! SECOND MAN. This is a perilous crowd;—all Rome's abroad. THIRD MAN. Long health to Cicero!—But for him, our necks Would have been headless now. FOURTH MAN. The rebels' swords Would have made sport among the citizens. [A burst of trumpets. Hark! FIRST MAN. They're nigh at last. SECOND MAN. They left the Palatine An hour ago, and scarce could make their way Through thousands strewing garments on the ground, And kneeling to kiss Cicero's hand. The air Is thick with chaplets showering from the roofs And tapestried casements, where our noblest dames Send their prayers after him. THIRD MAN. Stand back. He comes! [The Crowd divide; the Procession advances, headed by Trumpets, blowing a funeral March; then follow Troops, Priests, Lictors; Cicero, with a drawn Sword, leading Lentulus, in Chains; Senators, in their robes, leading each a Prisoner. As they pass, the dialogue continues. FIRST MAN. That's Lentulus, the Cornelian!—Cinna's blood. A kingly epicure!—See his tangled hair And flushing cheek, as if the last night's drink Still fever'd him. SECOND MAN. How stately Cicero looks! THIRD MAN. If ever man look'd like a god, 't is he! FOURTH MAN. If ever man felt like a god, 't is he! FIRST MAN. See old Autronius: he was Consul once,— A jester even in bonds. SECOND MAN. Who's he that stoops?— Pale as a beaten slave. THIRD MAN. That's Marcus Cassius; Last year he canvass'd against Cicero. FOURTH MAN. Those two are Sylla's nephews. FIRST MAN. How the first Glares like a tiger chain'd! He would have worn His uncle's thirstiest sword.—His brother's eye Is lofty, and he treads the ground like one, Who would have had his nobler part, and been Rome's hero. [The Procession continues to the Foot of the Scaffolds; the Conspirators ascend: the Trumpets give the Signal for Death. The People shout—“Hail, Cicero.—Father of his Country!” The Scene closes. SCENE II. Evening. Catiline's Army in the Apennines. An Encampment. A General's Tent in the Centre, with Standards in front, round the Silver Eagle. A Flourish of Trumpets. Cethegus and Valerius come from the Tent. VALERIUS. Our work's ill-omen'd; we must sheathe our swords. CETHEGUS. Ay—but in Roman bosoms! VALERIUS (pointing to the distance). See that smoke! CETHEGUS. Above the out-post? VALERIUS. No;—where yonder vines Festoon the valley.—In that yellow thatch Now the sunn'd peasant at his supper sits, With all his babes about him;—then lies down, Blessing the gods, and thus shuts in the day, Unpress'd by heavier thoughts than with what face To morrow's sun shall look upon the sky, Or in what hive his honey-bees shall swarm, Or to what elm his vine shall be a bride; Or whether he shall pipe his woolly flocks To hill or vale,—or some such gentle care, To put a healthful motion in his mind.— I'm weary of the sword.— CETHEGUS. Then take the scrip! You are a music-lover, and sigh Greek. This comes of evil company. Your lyre Has broke the rest of many a stately dame, Who left her curtains tenantless, to gaze, Where the chill'd minstrel sent his amorous soul Up through the moonshine. VALERIUS (despondingly). Catiline's undone! CETHEGUS. Give me a boar-spear, and my Thracian hounds— A cross of the Epirot, Pyrrhus' breed, The noblest of the world! Cethegus asks No better kingdom than these forest hills. The sun should never find me in my hut, Nor evening see me homewards, but with spoil Of stately venison hanging at my back, Or boar's head on my spear;—my horn should be My music,—worth a thousand twanging harps:— My honest courtiers, my bold brinded dogs,— My palace pomps, the trophies of the chase, Antlers and tusky skulls, the eagle's plume, Vulture and otter, bear, and villain fox, Hung round my heathy walls!— [Catiline comes from the tent. VALERIUS. Hail, general!— CATILINE. That skirmish was disastrous; but the troops Are of true mettle. VALERIUS. We had gain'd the hill, But for Hamilcar's charge upon our flank. I knew his furious speed. CETHEGUS. Numidian traitor! He shall be found. CATILINE. He's sacred to my sword.— What of the enemy? VALERIUS. They move to-night. CETHEGUS. To stop our road to Gaul? CATILINE. My road is—Rome! CETHEGUS. I have some lingering weakness that half bends My sword to Gaul. CATILINE. (turning on him). Is it the Roman soul, Or Rome's brown walls and ditches, that make Rome? If't is the soul, this spot is the true Rome, And the proud Capitol's a den of thieves. CETHEGUS. When do you march? I'm ready, live or die.— Ages could not rebuild the Palatine! [Gloomily. CATILINE (with impatience). You are a Roman citizen! Will Rome Feed, clothe you; find a roof to screen your head From the same violence of earth and air That pelts the beggar? Where's her largess now? Where holds she her purse open for your hands To plunge in, and be rich?—Whom should you love? Him who loves you: and whom pursue to death, But him who wears a dagger for your heart? CETHEGUS. I hate her men. CATILINE (contemptuously). And keep your grief for stones! Why, when a serpent hisses in your path, Is every sinew summon'd to your sword, Your eyeball strain'd, your arm at its full stretch, Above a reptile, that, as through the grass It rolls, displays such glorious colouring, As fixes the raised eye on evening clouds, Or on the lustre of a frosty star? You know the deadly puncture of its fang, And thus its beauty makes it more abhorr'd. Rome's splendours, though her streets were paved with gold, To me are but the colours on the skin Of the great reptile! Go, sir, sheathe your sword; I must have steadier soldiers. CETHEGUS (offering his hand). Catiline! Those are hard words:—There's not a man on earth But you, that might have used such bitter speech, And lived to boast of 't!—Twice you saved my life; In Spain, and in my dungeon. Now my sword Is yours for ever! CATILINE (clasping his hand). There!—Let 's die like friends! My speech was rash; forgive it,—'t was a mind Stuff'd with distemper'd thoughts that spoke—not I. [A distant sound. What tumult's there? VALERIUS. Some clamour of the camp. CETHEGUS. Our murmurers talk of peace! CATILINE. Of peace!—Pale fools!— Have I not cut 'twixt Rome and me a trench, That it must take our bodies to fill up? Who calls me hypocrite? The rebel's work Is blood and plunder! Who draws this for good! [Drawing his sword. This emblem of all miseries and crimes,— The robber's tool, that breaks the rich man's lock,— The murderer's master-key to sleeping hearts,— The orphan-maker—widower of brides;— The tyrant's strength—the cruel pirate's law,— The traitor's passport to his sovereign's throne,— The mighty desolator,—that contains, In this brief bar of steel, more woe to the earth Than lightning, earthquake, yellow pestilence, Or the wild fury of the all-swallowing sea! CETHEGUS. A legion should be posted on the hill. CATILINE. Secure the valley. Here we camp to-night. [Cethegus and Valerius go out. The dew falls heavy; and the rising wind Moans through the tree-tops like day's funeral song. Would it were mine!—'Tis happier to be dead, Than, being what I was, be what I am. But I am rebel, and must stand to it!— The dead man's pillow is not scared with dreams; His day is haunted by no sadder sights Of visages, grown desperate in his cause; His fever's cold; he has no heart-ache now; Has no ambition! [Aurelia is seen in the tent. How fares my noble dame? AURELIA. Well, Catiline,— And yet—not well. You saw the day go down? CATILINE. Like all that went before. AURELIA. I thought the sun Look'd like a warrior dying on the field,— That those red gushes of the stormy west Streak'd all with streams of gore! CATILINE. Come forth into the air! For thoughts like those Are medicined best by nature. (She comes.) Stand awhile. AURELIA. This sky's Ionian, not of Italy. CATILINE. Night's galley's launch'd,—her cloudy sails are up,— Yon stars the new-lit lamps upon her prow,— These perfumed gusts, the breezes that swell out Her cloudy sails;—and those small, whisper'd sounds, Thus dying sweet,—the airy surges' swells, That break before her slow and dusky stem. AURELIA. 'Twas on a night like this I sail'd by Crete, When all the waves were lull'd with silver sounds, And all the mountains moonlike with pale fires Of Cybele's altars. (A chorus is heard.) Hark! CATILINE (smiling). Those are our minstrels.—'Tis thus soldiers hail The dark and frowning goddess of the night, To guard their pillows from all evil dreams; For in their rudeness still lives ceremony. And well may they commend themselves to Heaven, [Despondingly. Who, flung to sleep in danger's iron grasp, May never welcome in another morn. AURELIA (with impatience). When do we march for Rome? CATILINE. You shall be safe! All is provided for. A troop to-night Will see you through Etruria. AURELIA. Go!—to-night! Abandon you in your extremity! Am I your slave, Patrician? I have stood Your equal from the first;—have never turn'd From sorrow, toil, or danger, by your side: For I was Marius' daughter, and your wife! CATILINE. Be wise! The time is short. Go, Roman wife! A rebel's fortunes are upon my head! Our home must be the hill-tops and wild caves,— Our canopy the forest's dripping boughs,— Our meal the berries, roots, and all strange food, That famine wrings from the step-mother earth,— Our rusty swords must be our health, wealth, hope,— Our life be battle, flight, and stratagem,— Till all is buried in a bloody grave! AURELIA. Misfortune is a fire that melts weak hearts,— But makes the firmer fire.—Here will I die! CATILINE. I have had warnings.—In my last night's sleep, I thought I saw myself, and you, and all Flung in one general tomb! AURELIA. A dream! no more. An undigested grape will do as much.— It was the battle,—'twas the day's turmoil That left its heavy traces on your brain. CATILINE. Perhaps so;—for, in truth, I've been, of late, Strangely beset, and sunk into the prey Of midnight hauntings;—not a passing wind— A cloud—the shadow of a shaken bush— But makes its mark upon my broken mind. My sleep has grown a round of horrid things, Terrors and tortures, that the waking sense Quivers to think of.—Sometimes I am hurl'd From mountain tops, or hung, by failing hands, To precipices, fathomless as hell;— Sometimes, engulf'd in the outrageous sea, And down its depths sent strangling,—then flung loose As many leagues aloft, above the moon, To freeze along the deserts of the sky;— Sometimes, in hot encounter with the foe, I feel a sudden javelin in my heart, And then I'm crush'd by heaps of dying men, And hear the battle turning o'er my head, And, fainting, strive to shout;—then, in this death, See spirits—and plunge downwards,—till I wake, Madden'd and blinded, thinking all around A remnant of my torturers;—and thus, night Is lost to me,—and sorrow's comfort, sleep, Is made my agony. [Cecina enters, pale and wounded: Catiline suddenly turns. What brings that spectre here? Vanish, or speak! CECINA. My lord, I am—Cecina! CATILINE. Mighty Jove! What mist was on my eyes?—He bleeds to death!— Within there! [Calls. CECINA. By and by,—I bear ill news. CATILINE. Tell it at once: if we had hearts to break By piteous tales—we had not lived till now. CECINA. You are undone! CATILINE (fiercely). I know it,—banish'd,—robb'd,— A price set on me,—hunted to the grave,— But yet not fang'd—not dead! CECINA. Your friends in Rome— CATILINE. Have they been brought to trial? One day more, And they shall see me at their prison gates, Laying their sentence on their sentencers. CECINA. My lord, your friends, last night, were—sacrificed! CATILINE. What,—dead?—all dead? (He covers his head with his robe.) And I was lingering here! CECINA. This hour they lie, each in his cell, a corpse. CATILINE (calls aloud). Sound all to arms! [A flourish of trumpets. Summon the captains,— [To an Officer. I would speak with them!— [The Officer goes. Now, hope! away,—and welcome gallant death! Welcome the clanging shield, the trumpet's yell,— Welcome the fever of the mounting blood, That makes wounds light, and battle's crimson toil Seem but a sport,—and welcome the cold bed, Where soldiers with their upturn'd faces lie,— And welcome wolf's and vulture's hungry throats, That make their sepulchres!—We fight to-night. [The Officers enter. Brave comrades! all is ruined! I disdain To hide the truth from you. The die is thrown! And now, let each that wishes for long life, Put up his sword, and kneel for peace to Rome.— Ye are all free to go.—What! no man stirs! Not one!—a soldier's spirit in you all? Give me your hands! (This moisture in my eyes Is womanish—'twill pass.) My noble hearts! Well have you chosen to die! For, in my mind, The grave is better than o'erburthen'd life;— Better the quick release of glorious wounds, Than the eternal taunts of galling tongues;— Better the spear-head quivering in the heart, Than daily struggle against Fortune's curse;— Better, in manhood's muscle and high blood, To leap the gulf, than totter to its edge In poverty, dull pain, and base decay.— Once more, I say,—are ye resolved?— [The Soldiers shout, —“All! All!” Then, each man to his tent, and take the arms That he would love to die in,—for, this hour, We storm the Consul's camp.—A last farewell! [He takes their hands. When next we meet—we'll have no time to look, How parting clouds a soldier's countenance.— Few as we are, we'll rouse them with a peal That shall shake Rome!— Now to your cohorts' heads;—the word's—“Revenge!” [Exeunt. SCENE III. Night. The interior of a Roman fortified Camp. Walls, with Towers and military Engines. A palisadoed great Gate; Troops on either side, with Torches. On the left a group of Standards. On the right a General's Tent. Shouts, and Sounds of Battle. Hamilcar comes in, speaking to an Officer. HAMILCAR. I think those shouts are nigh the westward trench. The Consul's weakest there. (Officer goes.) And here I stand, Leaving to others the bold outward fight, To lurk behind a wall.—I should have faced The proudest sword on earth—but Catiline's.— His eye would drink the spirit of my blood, And make my scimitar a reed.—Who's here? [Shouts, “A prisoner!” Cethegus is brought in. Cethegus taken—alive! [In surprise. CETHEGUS. (to HAMILCAR). Dog of an African! Betrayer!—perjurer!—felon! Give me breath!— Had not my charger fallen, that villain head Had been upon my spear. HAMILCAR (anxiously). Is Catiline slain? CETHEGUS. How dare you name him? HAMILCAR. (with haughtiness.) Is the rebel dead? CETHEGUS. Dead or alive, he's glorious! In the rout That bore him backwards o'er the fatal trench, I saw him fighting, with a giant's strength, Cover'd with wounds,—his corslet beaten off,— His unhelm'd brow mask'd with his spouting blood;— The battle's soul,—knight, spearman, general, all;— Shouting to this man,—grasping t'other's robe,— Slaying a third,—and ever turning back To charge the cow'd pursuers— HAMILCAR (to the Soldiers). Set him free. [Cethegus is taken out; shouts and trumpets. My mind misgives me, or the battle's turn'd!— Stand to your arms.—What ensign 's in the field? SOLDIER (from the Walls). The Marian Eagle,—and a column comes, Straight on the Consul's centre. Now, they charge!— The trench is taken. HAMILCAR (hastily). To the ramparts, all!— Quick, load the engines,—let the archers shoot,— Whirl slings,—rain lances,—give them steel i'the teeth; Fight all, as if, upon his single arm, Each bore the whole high fortunes of the night. [Shouts at the Gates. Trumpets. CATILINE (without). Once more!—and put your souls into your blows; Be iron, like your lances,—fierce as fire,— Strong as the whirlwind!—Charge!—The word's “Revenge!” [The Gates are beaten down, and the Works fired; Catiline rushes in unhelmed and wounded; the Troops give way; Hamilcar, after a struggle with himself, bends to the ground; Catiline approaches; he stops before Hamilcar, who strips his bosom. HAMILCAR. Strike here, and be revenged! CATILINE. Die! [He lifts his Sword, but turns away; Hamilcar starts on his feet and stabs himself; Catiline stands, gazing at him. CECINA (coming in). Triumph, my general!—For the field's our own. The Consul's flank is turn'd, and all his line Are chaff before the wind. CATILINE (exclaims). Onwards!—To Rome!— [Voices of the Captains, in succession, without: “Onwards!—Onwards!—Onwards!—” CATILINE. To Rome!—(His voice failing).—To Rome! [Aurelia and Cethegus support him. Where is Aurelia? [Falling. [She bends over him. I must die.—Farewell!— [He springs from the ground. Is there no faith in Heaven? My hour shall come! This brow shall wear the diadem, and this eye Make monarchs stoop. My wrath shall have a voice Strong as the thunder; and my trumpet's breath Shall root up thrones. Your husband shall be King!— Dictator!—King of the world!— [He falls suddenly, and dies. THE END. SEBASTIAN. A SPANISH TALE. I. Thou land of love and loveliness, what dreams Of pomp, and beauty, and old chivalry Haunt the green borders of thy mighty streams, Imperial Spain! Years and long ages fly, Leaving the palace and the mountain tower Buried beneath their purple bed of rose; But still thy morn in dewy brightness glows, Still falls thy eve the same enchanted hour; The same pure splendour lightens from thy moon, Rolling along that boundless upper flood, Whose waves are clouds, her solemn-moving throne. And prouder still, the heart is unsubdued That made thee from the cuirass'd Roman wring With naked hands his jewell'd coronal; And tore the sceptre from the Moslem king, Sending him, from Granada's ivory hall, To make with fox and wolf his rocky lair, And perish in the Alpuxarras bare. Spain! thou hast had thy day of toils and woes, And, for the sword, thy hand has felt the chain; But, when the giant from his slumber rose, The Frank was swept, like mist, from mount and plain. Now to my tale, a tale of long past years, Of pains, and joys, strong faith, and love's bewitching tears. II. 'Twas night; but now on Turia's glassy wave The eastern stars a fainter lustre gave, A chaunt arose, 'twas from the convent-hill, It linger'd, lapsed, and all again was still; But, as the matins pass'd, the eastern gray Wore vermeil tinges—'twas the dawning day. A flag was floating on the convent tower, And soon were busy hands in every bower, Culling the lily and the eglantine, In their first dews, to wreathe round stall and shrine; And soon peal'd out, in rich and distant thunder, The tolling of the convent's far famed bell, Filling the air above, around, and under, With the deep music of its mighty swell; For on this high and holy day, at noon, Princely Sidonia's daughter was to wear The robe, that, like the shroud, when once put on, Leaves the wild heart no more to hope or fear. III. 'Tis noon, and plumes and scarlet banners gleam Along the plain, a winding, glittering stream, Reflected in the Turia's mirror blue; And now it opens on the nearer view A splendid cavalcade of youths and dames, Medina, Arcos, Alvarez, high names That by Pelagio on his mountains stood, And never knew a shade of Moorish blood, But on their plunging lances; deep their steel Had mow'd the harvest of the Infidel. Now slowly up the mountain's side they come, With harmonies, that in the distance seem Like the bee's music o'er the apple bloom, Like the low murmurings of a morning dream; And now the sound is clearer, yet as sweet As when it flow'd around the mountain feet, A rich, deep swell of flute and forest horn, And now and then a stirring trumpet blast, That bursts and dies away, like lightning borne Into the bosom of the cloud and past. The cavalcade has reached the convent height, Where wait its slow ascent the peasant throng, Struggling to see, for once in life, the sight Whose story shall, through many an evening long, Beguile them of the time, and make the pride Of him who saw that day's devoted bride. IV. The porch is fill'd with rich-escutcheon'd cars, And glossy jennets, plumed and ribbon-rein'd, Pure Arab blood, their foreheads bright with stars, Quick-eyed, full-crested, high and purple vein'd: They stand with nostrils wide and chests thick panting; For all their passage up that causeway slanting Had been a mimic combat, many a spear Had cross'd the saddle in that gay career. The sight within was splendid; from the porch The aisle's long vista shew'd the lamp, and torch, And holy urn of frankincense and myrrh, Filling the air with fragrance and with gloom, And, twined round shrine and time-worn sepulchre In lovely mockery, the rose's bloom; Within the stone what darker mockeries lie Of man and pomp! Oh vain mortality! All to the chancel gates was pearl, and plume, And ermined cap, and mantle stiff with gold, For there the tide of knights and dames had roll'd, And there had stopp'd: beyond was like a tomb, Shut from the daylight, high barr'd, silent, cold; And in it beings scarcely of man's mould Were moving, scatter'd, swift, and soundlessly, Shadows that rose and perish'd on the eye. Now sounds come echoing, such as spirits breathe On their night watches, if the tale be true, Around the loved in life, the loved in death, Calling them upwards to the concave blue: And on the walls, as far as eye can gaze, Floats through the dusk a torch's wavering blaze Above a throng of mitre, cross, and cope, In pale and vision'd lustre. Sudden ope The chancel gates; the stately abbot comes. Down to the ground are stoop'd the knightly plumes, And every lady bows her gemm'd tiar, That shoots down light like an earth-stooping star. V. THE HYMN. “Open ye gates of peace, receive the bride, In beauty come to pledge her virgin vow. Oh! not with mortal thoughts those cheeks are dyed, Those downcast eyes not touch'd with mortal woe; The eyes of seraphim behold her now, And, veiling their bright foreheads with the plume, They lay before her feet their chaplets low. Daughter of princes, heir of glory, come! Open ye gates of peace. She triumphs o'er the tomb. “Come, beautiful, betroth'd! The bitter sting Of hope deferr'd can reach no bosom here, Here life is peace, unwreck'd by dreams that spring From the dark bosom's living sepulchre. At these high gates die sorrow, sin, and fear. Woe to the heart where passion pours its tide; Soon sinks the flood to leave the desert there; Here love's pure stream with hues of heaven is dyed. Come, child of Paradise. Come, Heaven's immortal bride.” VI. In the low echoes of the anthem's close The murmurs of a distant chorus rose. A portal open'd, in its shadow stood A sable pomp, the hallow'd sisterhood, They led a white-robed form, young, delicate, Where life's delicious spring was opening yet: Yet was she stately, and, as up the aisle She moved, her proud, pale lip half wore a smile: Her eye was firm, yet those who saw it near, Saw on its lash the glistening of a tear. All to Sidonia's sainted daughter bow'd, And she returned it calmly, like one vow'd To loftier things. But, once she paused; and press'd With quick, strange force her slight hand to her breast, And her wan cheek was redden'd with a glow That spread its crimson to her forehead's snow; As if the vestal felt the throes that wreak Their stings upon young hearts about to break. She struggled, sigh'd; her look of agony Was soothed, and she was at Sidonia's knee. Her father's tears of anguish on her fell; His gentle heart abhorr'd the convent cell; Even now he bade her pause. She look'd to heaven, One long, wild pressure to his cheek was given, Her pale lip quiver'd, could not say “farewell.”— The bell gave one deep toll, it seem'd her knell; She started, strove his strong embrace to sever, Then rush'd within the gate—that shuts for ever. VII. The final, fatal rite was duly done, The tress was shorn, the sable veil put on, That shades like night the day of hope and youth; The golden ring was given, the pledge of truth, That, bound on earth, grows firmer by the grave. And, down the mountain's side, that splendid wave Of beauty and bright chivalry is rushing, To where Sidonia's palace gates are flushing In the red setting of the summer sun. And there are high festivities begun, And flags are streaming from the gilded towers, And peasant girls are strewing bridal flowers, And shouts and praises of the brave and fair, Sebastian and Maria, fill the air. Sidonia, on that day, was doom'd to part With two he loved; the nearest to his heart Had gone to pine her loveliness away In the cold shadows of the convent day; And ere upon the clouds that evening died, Maria was to blush, Sebastian's bride. VIII. But as the train had clear'd the chestnut glade, Again was heard the gallant horseman's vaunt, Again the mimic tournament was play'd, And cheering cries were heard, and ladies' taunt Of knightly gallantry, and grace, and speed. Stirr'd at the sight, out sprang Maria's steed, All reins were loosed; her foot was like the wind; Alone Sebastian follow'd close behind. Still sate the noble lady saddle-fast: The plain, the moat were, swift as lightning, past: The buttress, bridge, were 'scaped by miracle: At her pavilion's porch the lady fell. The danger that had braced her lofty heart, Was gone, but with it the high heart was gone; In vain the husband's kiss, the leech's art; Her spirit soar'd from that cold threshold stone. IX. Sebastian had not loved, but he could give The tears of man to beauty's sudden doom. He felt no cureless agony, though eve Oft found him lingering by Maria's tomb. A little month had given her to the world; Till then a lingerer in the cloister's gloom, To wed with bloom and birth her birth and bloom, To live, be happy, and from life be hurl'd. Sidonia, childless, bow'd his head to fate, And shut himself in his Valencian hall; His heart and hall alike were desolate. His life was buried in the veil and pall. Sebastian watch'd his misery, as a son Beside a father's pillow, day by day, Until he saw the first, keen sorrow done; Then, to assuage his own, yet unheal'd, pang, The gentle bridegroom to his saddle sprang, And wander'd lonely through the land away. X. But those were stirring times; for England's lance Was rushing fiery o'er the fields of Spain. Before it waved the plume of vaunting France, Waved, to be rent on mount, and stream, and plain. Not for herself, fair Albion shook the steel, That oft had blazed before the Catalan, Making the squadrons of the Moormen reel; It led th'Imperial Austrian's hopeless van. But France was swept before it, as the tide Before some lordly vessel's plunging prow, Yet still, though scattered foaming from her side, Filling her track, tumultuous, baffled, slow. War raged: and where it rages, is wild woe; And all its curse was heavy upon Spain; Her heaven and earth were changed; the crystal well Was now a grave, a sanguine pit of slain; The hamlet was a waste, the vineyard dell Was now the pining peasant's chilling lair; Along the thymy slope, where gentle eyes Oft watch'd the rising of the evening star, Signal of love, and lover's melodies, Now burst at eve the burning temple's glare; But glorious England, thine was not the lance That ever stain'd its brightness with a tear. And when did haughty, headlong, heartless France Pause o'er the prostrate in her wild career? Sebastian saw the wreck; his father's vane Had waved against the Frank in many a field; The Austrian bird soon cover'd its red shield; He called his serfs, a bold and crowded train, Heard their first shout, and was himself again. XI. 'T was evening as they reach'd the mountain's brow That showed them Barcelona in the vale, And long they paused to see that lovely show; The sun low levelled on the city pale, Montjuif's bright brow, the Frenchman's standard hung, Shame of its battlements; the port's thick sail, Like clouds upon its sea of sapphire flung, The white tents scatter'd o'er the fields, like snow That winter leaves upon the green of spring, The English martial lines, that seem'd the flow Of living streams, the verdure crimsoning. The mighty sun sank down. The citadel Sent from its battlements the evening peal. Slow in its smoke the Bourbon banner fell: From England's twilight camp the answering gun Sent up its solemn roar, and ere 'twas done A flourish of bold music, drum and horn, Follow'd its white, fierce incense up the air. But from the city other sounds were borne, Cathedral chaunts, and bells that rang for prayer. XII. His troop lay stretch'd upon the mountain heath Faint with the parching travel of the day. 'T was midnight, hill and vale were hush'd as death. Anon, a rocket shot a yellow ray, And died; another and another rose. The drums beat out; no moment for repose. A fiery circle ran round Montjuif's height; The city was a blaze of lurid light. Up sprang Sebastian, vaulted on his steed, Spoke the few words that touch the man of Spain, Then down the mountain rush'd with arrowy speed. Clear as the morn, the flashings of th'assault Show'd on the plain the red battalions squared, The squadrons mounted, that the night's grim vault Had hidden, till the blaze upon them glared Like the grim entrails of a mighty mine. From Montjuif thunder'd still the incessant din, The shot from loop and bastion shower'd like hail; Sebastian gave the spur, he pass'd the vale, He found the English warriors on its brow, In their close, iron line; with steady gaze Eyeing the fire, that round them pour'd a glow Fierce as a furnace, waiting but the word, To spring upon the battlements;—none stirr'd, No voice was heard;—at last the word was given; A shout like thunder echoed England's name! The Frenchman from the wall, like dust, was driven; Then sank the clash, the thunder, and the flame. XIII. Proud Barcelona, on the sunny shore That lines with silver Spain's resplendent sea, What can for sport or splendour vie with thee? But now, thy day of war and terror o'er, Like sudden madness burst thy grateful glee. Thy morning streets were fill'd with pageantry; At eve thy Rambla rang with dance and song; Night, midnight found the still unwearied throng Wandering by seashore, or illumined shade, Busy with mask, and feast, and serenade. Sebastian saw its splendours with the eye Of youth, and health, and recent victory. But his high heart for nobler pleasures pined, The joys of mind alone can fill the mind. War still remain'd; Granada's walls defied The bold ally that always leads the van; And never lover long'd to meet his bride More than he long'd to see the battle's dawn. XIV. The order came, to march. On that last eve There was a banquet in Valverdé's halls, The city's noblest name. The tapestried walls, Shower'd light on all the loveliest of the land, On slender, waving shapes, like flow'rets fann'd Into new grace by every breeze that blows. The night flew on, to dance, and lover's talk, And the light wit that wins the ready smile. But love's true spirit seeks the secret walk, And many a pair by garden-bower, and rill, Wander'd in dreams that one poor hour must sever, Sweet pain, that balms the heart yet makes it bleed; By morn the lover must be on his steed; That parting look might be their last,—for ever! XV. Sebastian through the crowd of masquers stray'd, Winging the wit that round the circle play'd; Those summer lightnings, flashes of the mind, That shine, but harm not; arrows rosy twined. Until he reach'd the garden colonnade, And drank the luxury of night and shade; A mingled stream of echoes of the lute, And the sweet, icy breath of flowers and fruit, Lemon and grape, and, touch'd with that mild sky, The pallid gold of the thick orangery. Against a pillar lean'd his glowing cheek, His mask was off, and never raptured Greek Struck from the Parian stone a nobler form; He look'd among that light and glittering swarm,— A stranger, from a loftier region sprung; His crimson Venice hat was backwards flung, Loosing the raven ringlets round his brow: And those who saw that cheek's delighted glow, The smile that then his red lip loved to wear, Had little thought that thirty years were there. But there was in his large and brilliant eye The depth, the fire of rich maturity: Though in that soften'd hour of earth and heaven, Th'unconscious glance that from its orb was given, The melting, melancholy gaze above Show'd that the heart within was made for love. XVI. He saw not that a group had gather'd nigh, Gazing upon his silence silently. He heard not, till upon his spirit came, In a low sigh of agony, his name. He started, saw a gentle fugitive, Saw her at distance through the concourse strive, Pursued, and lost her. But his eye no more Could in its calmness to that blue heaven soar. “Oh! but see the lip that breathed that sigh! Breathed it for him? was't love, woe, mockery? That young lip must be lovely; soul, high soul, Was in the sigh that o'er its ruby stole.” So had one breath disturb'd his spirit's stream, And such the wanderings that make passion's dream. XVII. He roved the sumptuous halls with eager eye, Met smiles, heard words of gentle gallantry, Gave o'er the search, and smiled to feel the pain, That smote him when he found the search in vain. Then follow'd, listless, where the deeper crowd Afar, to see some new-born wonder, flow'd, Scarce hearing the gay levities that past Through the gay throng, each lighter than the last:— “Whence came the miracle? from pole or line?— Some minstrel, freshly bronzed from Palestine, Famish'd and fetter'd, till the Arab bark, Flung out the dove, well fitted for its ark.— Valverdé's taste! that fosters every mime; The common prey of every son of rhyme. A woman? Some soft Charlatan from Rome; Some saint, that wears no veil to hide her bloom.” On roll'd they, and Sebastian with the tide, The echo of a distant harp their guide. XVIII. Before them rose a large and lofty tent, Tissued with emblems of Spain's ancient wars; Through the slight silk the myrtle breathed its scent, And pour'd their beams the blue and midnight stars. Raised, like an idol, on the slight ascent Of a low, central tripod sat a Moor, The young magician of those sounds: the floor, The waving walls, were touch'd with tender gloom. She was unveil'd, and yet the shawl of green, That wreathed its thick pearl'd fringe her locks between, Threw shadow, dim and deep, upon her bloom; But slight the tinge the Afric sun had thrown Upon her cheek, the eye dark diamond shone. She sat beneath a lamp of figured gold, That on her turban pour'd a dazzling flame. Her minstrel tale of wonder but half told, Her hand still floating o'er the harp's rich frame; She gave one glance: her cheek seem'd flush'd with shame. She cast upon the ground her startled eye, And swept the harp,—a clash of discord came; Her bosom through its caftan panted high; But all her voice was one deep, painful sigh. The gay assemblage, sympathizing, gazed On her strange beauty and her sudden pain. Their plaudits proud her sinking spirit raised, She bow'd, and, blushing deep, renew'd the strain. Again her hand, her voice seem'd wandering;— She dried a tear, and gave her prison'd anguish wing. XIX. “Farewell, my gentle harp, farewell, Thy task shall soon be done, And she who loved thy lonely spell Shall like its tones be gone. Gone to the bed where mortal pain Pursues the weary heart in vain. “I shed no tears, light passes by The pang that melts in tears. The stricken bosom that can sigh, No mortal arrow bears. When comes the heart's true agony, The lip is hush'd and calm the eye. “And mine has come, no more I weep No longer passion's slave, My sleep must be th'unwaking sleep, My bed must be the grave. Through my wild brain no more shall move Or hope, or fear, or joy, or love.” XX. She droop'd upon the harp; still paused the crowd, Witch'd by the thrilling sweetness of her song; And tears had fall'n on many a bosom proud; For music has the key of memory, And thoughts and visions buried deep and long, Come at the summons of its sweetness nigh! The silence broke with one relieving sigh. At length the loud applause awoke, but she, Before whose feet the gems and gold were flung, Still on the harp, dejected, fainting, hung. Sebastian caught her sinking: he had heard And seen what plunged his soul in reverie, And now he held her dying! From her eye A slow tear stole: her startled glance was rear'd To his stoop'd brow. He felt a shudder run Through her faint frame:—her gesture said, begone. His sick heart sank! he left her to the care, That press'd around with balm and essence rare, Gave one wild glance, and fled, and was alone. XXI. Sebastian wander'd forth; the garden air Rush'd on his cheek, nor cool'd the fever there; He gasp'd for breath. A sparry fountain shot Its waters in the moonlight: by its grot He stood, as if the sounds his heart would lull; His face, so sad, so pale, so beautiful, Fix'd on the moon, that in her zenith height Pour'd on his naked brow a flood of light: Shrined, moveless, silent, in the splendid beam, He look'd the marble Genius of the stream. Silence around; but when the night wind sway'd, Or some roused bird dash'd fluttering through the shade: For those he had no ear; the starry vault, The grove, the fount, but fed one whelming thought, Time, fate, the earth, the glorious heaven above, Breathed but one mighty dream, that dream was love. XXII. Sebastian had seen beauty, and his name Had lighted many a lady's cheek with flame. Rich, high-born, graceful, such may woo and win, While courteous words conceal the chill within: But, with the warrior burning in his blood, He left the fair pursuers unpursued: Bound to Sidonia's daughter from his birth, Laugh'd at the little tyrant of the earth; Could talk, as others talk, of hope and fear, But never gave the god a sigh or tear. XXIII. But now the world was changed, the die was cast! “How had he slept so long to wake at last? What hid the feelings that now shook his soul? Where was the cloud that gave the thunder-roll? This, this was life; at last he walk'd in light, The veil of years was rent before his sight. 'T was not her beauty, though the loveliest there Was lifeless, soulless, featureless to her; No, nor her melting voice, nor that slight hand That her sweet harp with such swift beauty fann'd, Like magic's silver sceptre, hovering To wake enchantment from the untouch'd string. Had he not seen that face before? But where? He knew not; 't was like music to his ear, Familiar, but forgotten; phrensy all! She was a Moor; nay, could he now recall The features that had madden'd him? Not one. All was a flash of splendour, dazzling, gone; A haze of matchless beauty on his eye, A sense confused, a vision, witchery. But she had scorn'd him; were not pain, hate, fear, In her wild glances, when but he drew near? Smiles for all else? The truth was now too late, That hour had stamp'd his life; he saw his fate. Yet—might not fondness, faith, her scorn remove? And who could hate, where all the crime was love?” XXIV. Delicious fantasy! the thought was balm; His heart, his eye in sudden rapture swam. Nature was charm'd to him. He could have talk'd With every star, that in its glory walk'd. Hope had put life in all unliving things; He hung above the fountain's rippling springs, And heard them echo joy; the bud unbranch'd That his light pressure on the streamlet launch'd, Bounded in joy; his deep and burning sigh Rose through the vine-leaves that gave sweet reply. A sudden meteor sail'd across the heaven, He hail'd its sign; to him, to him 't was given, Omen of joy, bright promise of bright years. “Let fear and folly have their ‘vale of tears.’ Let him be blest with that unequall'd one; Whoe'er she was, she might, she must be won; Life would roll on, one calm and blossom'd spring; Or, if the tempest came, they would but cling With arms and hearts the closer, till 't was o'er; Life a long joy; and death, a pang, no more.” Out burst in speech the lover's ecstasy. XXV. A sudden bugle pierced the morning sky. He started from his dream. The yellow dawn Wander'd along night's borders, like the fawn, First venturing from its dappled mother's side; A timid bound on darkness, swift withdrawn, Then bolder tried again.—The starlight died; And now the trumpet to the trumpet cried, The waggon groan'd, the echoing lash was plied, The gun roll'd ponderous through the rampart-arch. The lover's world was o'er! He heard the march: And shudder'd: but the tramp of crowding hoofs, The soldier's laugh, the shouting from the roofs, Where the roused city cluster'd thick as bees; The rattling drum, the banners in the breeze, All told the long-wish'd hour. But now 't was doom; 'T was come, it crush'd his heart; but it was come. XXVI. He rush'd impatient through the halls of state, No tidings there; the halls were desolate. Yet, while his foot was in the stirrup hung, His word was “tidings of the minstrel Moor”; His purse was to the bowing menials flung, Yet “to his boons to come, its weight were poor: Lived there the man who could but name her name?” None knew it, where she went, nor whence she came. XXVII. Sebastian led the van. The trumpet's thrill Found a responsive chord within him still; And when he saw the martial pomp around, And felt the gallant steed beneath him bound, And drank at morn the spirit of the air, He seem'd his comrades' proudest joy to share: But when at night his weary limbs he threw On the cool heath, beneath the sky of blue, Back to the tent his sleepless fancy flew, And felt the love, the rapture, the despair. XXVIII. Grenada's gate was storm'd, the cross of red Fix'd on the Moorish wall, the Frenchman fled: Sebastian bleeding to his tent was borne. First in the charge, the fire, the escalade, A ball had struck him; agonized and torn, He saw his standard on the rampart soar, Join'd in the shout, and sank, and saw no more. XXIX. One evening, as the sun was setting sweet, Making its rays a coronet for the hill, The Solsierra, at whose flowery feet Twined like a golden fetter the Xenil, And the birds sang, and the dissolving heat Was fann'd by that light, balmy, fluttering breeze, That shades the azure of Italian seas; He left his chamber for the mountain bower, His eyes' delight, and grief, through many an hour, When sunk upon his couch, he saw it wave, And thought between them lay his early grave. But, thanks to nature, and his leech's art, A peasant follower of the camp, his heart Had found its firmer pulses, and his cheek Wore, though still faintly, health's reviving streak. XXX. And oft, before he reach'd the summit height, He paused, in silent, dazzled reverie; For in the living world no lovelier sight Of Summer's painted beauty meets the eye. Above him, one bright blue infinity; The land beneath him boundless as a sea; Magnificent with all bright shapes and dyes, Leagues of tomato, vineyards, orangeries, And yellow pasture plains that seem'd to rise And vanish in the far Nevada's blue. And at his feet, like webs of silver dew, Glistening and woven through the Huerta's bowers, From many a Moorish fount the living rill. And farther off, your brighter, broader streams Smooth-gliding Vargo, rapid Monachil, With serpent splendours in the sunset gleams, Sweeping in pomp, by hills, and groves, and towers. XXXI. The mountain where he stood was famous ground, For there the Caliph's crescent had been riven; And still the Arab breathes a prayer profound For the Alhambra's halls, his earthly heaven. Sebastian rested on the low, red wall That girds the palace, like the shatter'd pall Flung round the bed of beauty's last decay. His eyes upon th'enchanted landscape lay. A voice, a whisper, trembled by his side, Faded upon the breathless air, and died! The sound return'd, and he stood listening To tones that, mingling with a faint guitar, Now floated round him, and now faded far, As if a spirit shook them from its wing. XXXII. SONG. “I know thy beauty; summer dreams Have shown me forms that look'd like thine. I've seen thee in the sunset beams; I've loved thee as a thing divine. How have I shunn'd thee! but thine eye Hangs o'er me, like a watching sphere, Star of my solitary sky. Where'er my spirit turns, 't is there. For life, for death, the chain is twined; Thou'rt in my mind, thou art my mind.” The song subsided, but the closing tone Woke memories wild and sweet. The sound was gone— Yet still it strangely linger'd in his ear. He look'd to heaven as if its clouds might bear The white-wing'd minstrel of those strains divine. He look'd around, but all was solitude, No shadow wander'd by the evening vine. A moment, in bewilder'd thought he stood, Saw the wind shake th'Alhambra's weedy pall, Ponder'd no more, but rush'd within the wall. XXXIII. Palace of beauty! where the Moorish Lord, King of the bow, the bridle, and the sword, Sat like a Genie in the diamond's blaze. Oh! to have seen thee in the ancient days, When at thy morning gates the coursers stood, The “thousand,” milk-white, Yemen's fiery blood, In pearl and ruby harness'd for the King; And through thy portals pour'd the gorgeous flood Of jewell'd Sheik and Emir, hastening, Before the sky the dawning purple show'd, Their turbans at the Caliph's feet to fling. Lovely thy morn,—thy evening lovelier still, When at the waking of the first blue star That trembled on the Atalaya hill, The splendours of the trumpet's voice arose, Brilliant and bold, and yet no sound of war; But summoning thy beauty from repose, The shaded slumber of the burning noon. Then in the slant sun all thy fountains shone, Shooting the sparkling column from the vase Of crystal cool, and falling in a haze Of rainbow hues on floors of porphyry, And the rich bordering beds of every bloom That breathes to African or Indian sky, Carnation, tuberose, thick anemone; Then was the harping of the minstrels heard, In the deep arbours, or the regal hall, Hushing the tumult of the festival, When the pale bard his kindling eyeball rear'd, And told of eastern glories, silken hosts, Tower'd elephants, and chiefs in topaz arm'd: Or of the myriads from the cloudy coasts Of the far western sea, the sons of blood, The iron men of tournament and feud, That round the bulwarks of their fathers swarm'd, Doom'd by the Moslem scimitar to fall; Till the Red Cross was hurl'd from Salem's wall. XXXIV. Where are thy pomps, Alhambra, earthly sun, That had no rival, and no second?—gone! Thy glory down the arch of time has roll'd, Like the great day-star to the ocean dim, The billows of the ages o'er thee swim, Gloomy and fathomless; thy tale is told. Where is thy horn of battle? that but blown Brought every chief of Afric from his throne; Brought every spear of Afric from the wall; Brought every charger barded from the stall, Till all its tribes sat mounted on the shore; Waiting the waving of thy torch to pour The living deluge on the fields of Spain. Queen of earth's loveliness, there was a stain Upon thy brow—the stain of guilt and gore, Thy course was bright, bold, treach'rous,—and 'tis o'er. The spear and diadem are from thee gone; Silence is now sole monarch of thy throne! XXXV. Sebastian wander'd on; he had no thought, No eye for earthly glories; had that spot Been Paradise, he would have wander'd on. He trod the “Court of Lions,” where the rill Strives through its sculptured bed to trickle still; No living sound was there; he lean'd beside The fountain where the Abencerrage died; And struck, in listless anger, from its brim The weeds that gather'd o'er it thick and dim. A footfall touched his ear: a sudden shade Twined swiftly through the distant colonnade! He sprang, and follow'd, but his step was mazed In the deep labyrinth of halls, emblazed With fretted gold, and purple, and all dyes Of plant or metal, and inscriptions wan, Crowding the cupola, and floor, and frieze, With spell and sculpture, tale and talisman. XXXVI. His search was hopeless, and he gave up hope; And yet would linger there. He left the slope, And wandered through the rose and tulip vale. The Houri garden, where ev'n noon look'd pale, But lovelier far; as woman, when she hears The name that thrills her heart, and smiles through tears. And now he stood within the central shrine, The canopy of peach and nectarine; The Harem bower; and though, in days gone by, To look upon its treasures was to die, Yet many a noble by the cypress wall Linger'd to hear their twilight music's fall: For, mingled with the perfumed air, would rise The rich theorb's, the cittern's melodies, And, in their pause, some song's soul-touching flow, Telling that even within that bower was woe. XXXVII. All now was loneliness, and he return'd, With weary steps; but as he glanced again Along the portal, where the sunlight burn'd On fairy Arabesque, and painted pane, And, in the tangled woodbine's crimson train Wreathing the turban'd marble, lay inurn'd The last Sultana,—kneeling by the tomb He saw a shape, 'twas hidden half in gloom; He saw a cowl, a dazzling, upturn'd eye, Touch'd with the hue of tear-drops scarcely dry; He knew that face, 'twas pictured on his heart, “But one, one word,—or form of earth or heaven, His passion might be heard, must be forgiven.” The vision was in prayer; he saw it start; He swept aside the foliage, saw the bough, That the light flyer bent, returning slow; Saw where the sandal press'd the blossoms strown; The rest was shadow, mystery;—it was flown. XXXVIII. There are some moments when the heart stands still; As if the mighty touch that deigns to fill Our sands had left them where they last ran down. Sebastian wander'd through the forest brown, And vineyard fields, that clothed the mountain's side, Unconscious as the rill, his murmuring guide; Till the last evening trumpet, through the grate, Told him he stood before Granada's gate. He reach'd his couch, its broider'd canopy Could charm no slumber to his weary eye. XXXIX. He rose, and tried to read; the gorgeous book Pleased for a moment, then his hold forsook: He touch'd, with eager hand, his loved guitar, 'Twas tuneless now, his thoughts were straying far; He sank upon his couch to wear away A sick man's heavy hours till tardy day. He spoke in fever. “Fabian, slumberer! How can you linger? Must I perish here?” Pain check'd his voice. An humble tone replied; He raised his eye; the leech was at his side. “Boy, this is misery;—to the grave to creep! Oh, half my wealth but for one hour of sleep. Here, try that pulse, these temple-throbs.—'Tis vain;— The medicine's not on earth that lulls this pain.” The wind breathed fresher through the lattice bower; He ask'd a tale to linger out the hour. The peasant-leech had none; “nor fay nor knight Had ever glitter'd on his lowly sight. Yet on his lord's guitar he might recall Some song,—his humble skill the skill of all.” On the light strings his fingers feebly move, “Sing then,” Sebastian said, “but not of love.” “My lord shall be obeyed,” the youth replied; The tone was mingled with offended pride;— “He scorns not more than I the idle strains Where perfidy of perfidy complains;— Woes of weak hearts, that never should be won; Wrongs of deluders by themselves undone.— Yet there is one, but scarcely song or tale, A pageant, now upon my memory pale, Yet brilliant once.” Sebastian murmur'd, “Sing.” The peasant bow'd, and chaunted to the string. XL. ZEPHYR AND THE ROSE-NYMPH Taken from a pageant on the Italian stage.. 'Tis Eve, the soft, the poet's hour, The dew is glistening on the bower; The bird is couching in its nest. The cloud is burning in the West. Heavy with sleep, the leaflets close, Around thy bloom, enchanting rose, Still gazing on the golden ray, The last sweet worshipper of day. A cloud descends, a meteor plume Shoots downward through the twilight gloom. Oh! who, at this soul-softening hour, So wildly rushes through the bower, Now winging fount, now grot, now grove? 'Tis Zephyr led by viewless Love. One spot there is, a myrtle dell; The stream makes music in its cell And the woodbine branch above, Coos to its mate a snowy dove. No more the Spirit's azure gaze On earth, on heaven, upbraiding, strays: Charm'd to the spot, his brightening eyes See odours from the ground arise. They spread, float, fade, on upper air; A simple rose-tree blushes there; It bends, it breathes, new blossoms swell On that strange tree of miracle. Till in its central, opening shade He sees a form of beauty laid. But, oh! upon that young cheek glows No crimson of its parent rose: Heavy and faint her head is hung, Her locks upon the wind are flung, Her eye is closed, eternal sleep Relentless seems her brow to steep. He clasps her to his heart, she wakes, On lip and cheek the crimson breaks; He smiles,—in waving light the robe Floats on her bosom's ivory globe! No words are whisper'd there, no sigh; What emblem like a lover's eye? All told at once: in mystic dance, Their footsteps o'er the verdure glance. Now, wreathing close, the ringlets flow From neck to neck of living snow; Now, shot asunder, bright and far, Swift as the arrows of a star, They cull the rose, or press the wine From thy rich cluster, melting vine. A chorus echoes; sudden stoop From cloud and car a glittering troop, In warrior pomp, in beauty's bloom, To join the lovely revel come. There diadems of Paradise Flash over beauty's brighter eyes, And wing'd and regal spirits wield The spear of flame and moon-orb'd shield. But soon the lance is thrown aside The helm of chrysolite untied; Earth, air are hush'd; the heavenward eye, The shape, alone are harmony; All waiting till the sign is given For that ecstatic dance from heaven. It comes; in volumed richness round, Rolls the descending pomp of sound. Away they sweep; no mortal ear, The treadings of those feet might hear! Not snow before the whirlwind driven, Not colours of the summer even, Not streamers of the column'd light, That reddens on the northern night, Not visions of the lover's sleep, So swift, so light, so lovely sweep. Then melting, like the sunset beam Along the rippling summer stream, Still bright, though all dissolved the rays; In parted groups the dance decays; The music dies, as twilight's wave Subsiding in its marble cave. Beside her lord, on sudden wings, The blushing bride, the Rose-nymph springs; The troop ascend; slow wheeling o'er The spot their pinions fann'd before; Till fade upon the mortal ear The warblings of their native sphere. XLI. “Where was that pageant play'd?” Sebastian said, And on the peasant fix'd his eager eye; “Was 't in Valencia, twelve months since?” a sigh Closed his quick tone. The peasant bow'd his head. “Aye,” said the feverish questioner, “that sight Is yet by many a heart remember'd well. Who that had seen the festal of that night, My marriage eve, could next day's woes foretell? Maria, sweet, unwedded bride, farewell!” He paused, then said, in faint soliloquy, “Are there not days that Fate has kept in store, At once its whole wild weight of grief to pour, The bitter price of long and prosperous years? Ruin'd Sidonia! from that hour of tears Thy heart was heap'd with woe; the distant wave Rolls over what was once thy noble son. But she, his best beloved, his hallow'd one, Whose life consoled him for the double grave; Better she ne'er was born;—her hard heart gave The deadliest blow;—he dies the death of shame. She fled her convent, stain'd her noble name; Fled, with a menial for her paramour;— Bane of her house, beyond all earthly cure;— Undone! in body and in soul undone!” “Are there no tidings?” said the listener.—“None; She lives in daring guilt, if yet she lives.” “What of her sire?”—“He dies, and he forgives.” XLII. Sebastian from his couch arose. The moon Reign'd in full radiance o'er the sky of June, Far round the vassal stars withdrew their fires. He lean'd his folded arms and high pale brow Against the casement's side. The light below Fell, snowlike, thick, on palace-roofs and spires: “'Twas a vain world.” He cast his eye above, And gave the musings way, that scarcely move Th'unconscious lip: the breathings of the soul. “How lovely dost thou in thy blue heaven roll, Shadow of Him whom none can see, and live. Yet what forbade thy mighty orb to give His fiery splendours? on night's fearful hour To lift the image of consuming power? Sweet moon, that look of soft tranquillity Was given in mercy to the sleepless eye; To cheer the tossing brow on fever's bed; To calm the midnight weeper o'er the dead; To raise the houseless wretch that sees thy beam, To thoughts of hours when life shall be no dream. XLIII. “Yet is earth's agony too strong for thee! What terrors does the eye this moment see, That sees like thine our world? What thousands groan On fields of slaughter; on the dungeon stone; Lost in the desert; struggling in the wave; The wrong'd, the exiled,—all in one, the slave. Aye! give me rack and flame before the den Where desperate slavery howls for home again. Are there no other tortures? Love, true love; Pang, that the light think light, the wise reprove; But the true anguish that disdains control; The folly, fever, phrensy of the soul. Yet, old Sidonia, art thou gazing now Upon this comforter? or slumbering low Where sorrow comes no more? Well hadst thou died, Laid in the grave thy gentle child beside; Before that second, deeper wound was given; There, there the dagger to the heart was driven. Talk I of suffering! All to thine is tame; A father's sorrow for his daughter's shame.” XLIV. Sebastian paused, and turn'd. “Yet silent? Boy: Thank Heaven, my blood was spared that base alloy; Was it not well?” The youth replied, “'Twas well. She was a wretch. She's dead.” His accent fell. “What!—have you seen her?”—“Yes, on that proud night, When every heart, but one, but her's, was light;— 'T was at the palace pageant; on the eve Of my lord's mournful bridal. Oh forgive— My careless hand no more shall touch that string. She clung to life, as shipwreck'd wretches cling, When the next wave must sweep them from the shore. Her cheek was whiter than the veil she wore; She mingled with the festive crowd unknown, Tasting her desperate joy;—her die was thrown!”— “The day before her vows! the world was dear;” “She loved it not; she had high business there.” “Know you her further story?” “Nothing—No.” “You weep.” “'Tis childish, weak, but tears will flow. She was the daughter of the lord I loved; Sidonia's vassal, could I see unmoved His loved one sink, beyond my baffled art, Sink in the sickness of the broken heart?” “What plunged her in the convent.” “Madness all; The phrensied piety that's sure to fall.” “Rash sufferer! but she quickly sought her cure; She fled, and with—” “Oh, with no paramour.” “A page was seen—” “No, as yon heaven is high, She had no paramour! That page was—I.” XLV. Sebastian gazed: “Where roves th'unhappy one?” “She roves no more; her earthly wandering's done.” “Aye, the loose, outflung follower of some camp, Blighted by burning noon, and nightly damp; Her heart a ruin, and her cheek a flame; Fever or famine closed her course of shame. Such is the tale; deny it not; 't is proved. If false, why shun the father that she loved? Why break her convent vows? She chose her chain.”— “No ear, save Heaven's, has heard her heart complain; Oh, had you seen too late repentance heap The ashes on her dying head!”—“You weep; She might be pitied—must not be forgiven; Compassion's human, pardon rests with Heaven; There let her make her peace: her heart is stain'd; The step is made that never was regain'd.” “Yet, if you loved her—”—“Her! presumptuous boy, Venture no more: love her!—At once destroy All honour, live in open shame, or fly, Scared,—wolf-like—from the glance of human eye! This thwarts and troubles me!—no more of love.”— He fix'd his look upon the mount above, From whose bold forehead in the moonlight beam, Th'Alhambra rose,—a silver diadem. “Passion of passions, sovereign, sole, sublime! Earth's only one that scorns to yield to time; There is thy temple, and this heart of mine Shall perish into dust upon thy shrine. Fabian, this eve I've seen within those walls A form, a mystery, that enchants, appals— That has hung o'er me like a summer-cloud, Till my heart burn'd, my feeble reason bow'd; Made the day's thought, the vision of my bed; Met me and shunn'd,—been in my grasp and fled, Till I have dream'd it of the shapes that come To train the thoughtless for the early tomb. There Fabian wilt thou see thy master laid?” The page replied not—his droop'd cheek was stay'd Heavy upon his knee, as over-wept.— XLVI. The moon went down; the fresher breezes swept; The flowers dropp'd dew; the stars grew white,—'t was dawn Sebastian sank in slumber, worn and wan, Till where he stood, the sun's increasing beam Pour'd in, and broke the unrefreshing dream. The room around was empty—where the page?— “Where could he stray—so patient, gentle, sage?” His chamber was deserted,—he was gone. “Who saw the truant leave the palace?” None; Or but a shepherd, who, as moonlight died, Had seen a corpse along the Xenil glide. XLVII. The search was follow'd close and long, in vain. The rest was faint suspicion, rude surmise, Where each man brings his mite of prodigies, And what to all is dark, all will explain. Few love the favourite, and their hate found food In his low voice, his tears, his solitude, Condemn'd him to the grand explainer Time, And long'd to know the sentence,—and the crime. Their master felt his loss; but one deep thought Made all else light; and, duly at each eve, The pilgrim wander'd to the hallow'd spot, Where he had seen the vision that would leave His heart,—yet not until its veins were cold. But never more did he that page behold. XLVIII. Then thoughts of old Sidonia struck his mind, No child to bless him, none that he could bless, Life, all but its last bitterness, resign'd.— Lonely himself, he thought of loneliness, And turn'd a moment from that mountain shrine, To be a gentle son to his decline. XLIX. Sidonia's courts look'd mournful as when last He saw them, but not lonely;—menials pass'd, Frequent and hurrying, though in silence all, And robed in sable. In the palace-hall Was pomp as in its proudest days of old; Yet many a black escutcheon lined the wall. What wrought the change he knew not, but it told, Though heavy on the heart had fall'n the blow, That time or Heaven had check'd the cureless woe. The old man met him with a smile, but pale, And welcomed him, yet welcomed with a sigh; “His daughter had return'd;—his prodigal;” A sudden tear stood trembling in his eye, And his lip quiver'd, and his hurried hand Swept from his brow the drops of misery. “She came in peace,—still pure,—but came to die.” Sebastian tried to cheer,—himself unmann'd To see in his enfeebled frame, how soon, How surely, Time's slow work by grief is done; And soothed, and led him gently, as if there He saw a leaf of Autumn, thin and sere, That the first breath might flutter from the tree. “She came in purity—but came to die,” Was all the old man's voice—still check'd by tears. Sebastian led him beyond menial ears, Calm'd him, and heard his brief and bitter tale. “Floranthe, daughter of his heart and years, Had come to him at last,—not false or frail, But worn by pain, and clouded by some woe That baffled hope;—her life was hovering now Above the grave.—The sufferer seldom spoke, Smiled never; hung for hours o'er lute or book, Loved through the garden shades to stray unseen; Was all, and more than all, that she had been, Most gentle, tender, filial; but her eye Bore in it Death's sure summons,—she must die.” L. 'Twas an autumnal day, and now the eve Walk'd on the western heaven, serene and slow. His guest now left Sidonia; for his flow Of tears was calm'd; and wander'd forth to leave His own o'erwhelming sadness for a while. He felt the balminess of evening's smile, As from the marble terraces he gazed O'er the smooth, velvet-verdure of the lawn, Where the tamed pheasant in the sunlight blazed, Spreading his eye-dropt pinions; and the fawn And leveret sported round the ancient trees. The breath of life was in the breathing breeze. And he was tempted on through thickets deep, Scatter'd with rills, and knots of forest flowers, That to his wounded fancy made such bowers, As he would have to shadow his lone grave. He heard a low, soft voice,—a gentle step On the dried leaves—the struggling sunlight gave A single beam—that shew'd a female form, Slight, sable-robed, and veil'd,—“Sidonia's child! Her woes were sacred.”—And the acacias wild, And the laburnum blossom's yellow swarm, Soon gave the intruder shelter from her eye, But kept him bound,—reluctantly, yet nigh. LI. The lady's heart seem'd weary, and she sank, In sudden weakness, on a velvet bank, That bore upon its gently rising green The marble image of a Magdalen. The victim clasp'd and kiss'd the statue's feet, And swept their damps with long and raven hair, Then on her rosary said a whisper'd prayer: The weeping rite was done; and to the sky, As if she communed with a spirit there, She turn'd and spoke—the words came tremblingly; “And costs it all this bitterness to die? Oh, how I lived upon his look, his step, His distant voice, his very garments' sweep: Gazed on him from my secret shade, until I felt my brain with growing phrensy thrill: Then bore away his glance, his slightest word, From that fond hour among my treasures stored; My bitter food of thought for nights and days.— The heart by death alone itself betrays, And mine was wild and wretched, yet could hide, Thank Heaven, the pang by which it all but died. Maria, angel, from thy throne above Bear witness of my homage to thy love; Hating the cell, I plunged within the cell, The boasted cure of those who love too well. When thou wast borne to thy reward sublime, And passion was no crime,—oh was 't a crime To follow my soul's lord through toil and pain, To face the sword, the pestilence, the chain, To watch him day and night, as spirits move Round those they love, mine was no earthly love?— I made the vow: 't was kept. I lived to see The price of vows forgotten, Heaven, to thee! A nun, thy pledged, thy consecrated bride, A perjured wanderer by a mortal's side! I was repaid; I sought his eye in vain; I heard,—the word is desperate,—his disdain.” LII. The sudden breeze sigh'd past. “Delicious wind That fans my dying cheek, my dying mind; Shall I not come upon thee like a stream Of music round my love, a gentle dream Resting upon his eyelids; while I tell All that the living bosom shrank to feel; And hear him answer, all his spirit hear, And love without a blush, without a fear? Me he will never know; unlovely grave, Thou soon shalt hide the heart his victim gave: And he will come in pride, and pomp, and bloom, And scorn the dust, to which his look was doom. Scorn it, oh, no, his generous tear will fall For the lost wretch who gave him heart, life, all: For he was all to her; the lowly flower Hid in the shadow of the lordly tower, Uncheer'd, yet shrinking at the slightest blast That o'er its grandeur swept; still clinging fast, Till at its foot 't was wither'd! Heart of mine, A human idol was within thy shrine! And for it thou wert stricken; dust to dust; The vestal sinn'd in soul; the blow was just. She was abandon'd to wild fantasies; She loved, she dream'd, she fail'd, she fled, she dies.” Her voice was gone. Against the statue's knee Back fell her head,—like wax, her pale, cold hands Dropp'd at her sides, as if her mortal sands Were run. Sebastian bounded from his tree, With trembling haste the sable veil removed, And saw—his lost, his lovely, his beloved! LIII. Here ends the tale—she died? No; if the world Is but a vanity at best, a toy, That, as for each the mighty bauble's twirl'd, Turns up the chance of sorrow or of joy; This is its gilded side; the moments given To love like this are moments lent from Heaven. The rest I tell not, have no power to tell; The old man's look, his burst of happiness, When on his ransom'd daughter's neck he fell; The blushing daughter's joyous, sweet distress, The cheerful tumult of the household hall, The crowding friends, the ceaseless festival: Nor how that gentle pair would leave them all, And wander through the garden, and the grove; And ever, by some unresisted spell, Find their steps turning to the evening dell: While o'er them flew the hours with feathery feet; For such are of the very life of love. Nor how the lady told the dear deceit Of the false Moor, and sang the madrigal, That lured his step within th'Alhambra wall: Nor how her spirit wither'd on the morn That stamp'd Sidonia's daughter with his scorn: Nor the proud lover's wonder that his eyes Should not have known that shape through all disguise; Although beneath her noble father's roof, That shape by stern decorum kept aloof, Perhaps had never met his hasty gaze. So lived they in a sweet romantic maze. Alone, amid the proud and festive throng, Painless, unless o'erpowering joy were pain, And oft Sebastian ask'd th'Alhambra song, And won the wanderer's tale, again, again. LIV. But the young vestal's vows?—'Tis well the Pope Is kind of heart, and fractures many a chain. I fear, in England they could have no hope, But dukes and ducats can do much in Spain: So they were wedded, and life's smoothest tide Bore on its breast the bridegroom and the bride. LORENZO DE' MEDICI. There is a tradition, that when Lorenzo the Magnificent was yet in his cradle, a wandering astrologer predicted his future renown. Infant—noble infant—sleep, While this midnight heaven I sweep. O'er thee burn a trine of stars, Jove the sovereign, fire-eyed Mars, Venus, with the diamond beam. Babe, thou 'lt wear the diadem, Wield the victor sword, and win Woman more than half divine. On this pure and pencil'd brow Latent bursts of lightning glow. Haughty Venice shall be bow'd When they rend the thunder cloud. Eloquence is on thy lip, Now, like roses when they dip Their budding crimson in the dew; But, when time shall change its hue, Law, and truth, and liberty On its paler pomp shall lie. What is magic's mightiest wand To the sceptre in this hand? Florence, city of the dead! Cast the ashes from thy head, At its touch the palm shall bloom On thy solitary tomb. Sea! that hear'st the dreary gale O'er thy lonely billows wail, When in strength this hand is raised, Thou shalt wear a crown emblazed; Gold and glory from the East Shall on thy green forehead rest, At thy feet the banners riven Mark thy foes, the foes of Heaven. Grave! where ancient genius lies, What shall bid thy slumberers rise? Glorious Infant! thou shalt stand, Sending down thy summons grand Through its depths, and they shall come Brighter for the transient tomb. In thy splendour, timid eye, Crowns shall lose their majesty; Dim before the soul enshrined, The fiery sovereignty of mind. Child of might, young miracle, Sweet Lorenzo, fare thee well! THE ARTIST'S CHAMBER. A SKETCH ON THE SPOT. The room was low and lone, but linger'd there, In careless loveliness, the marks of mind; The page of chivalry, superb and drear, Beside a half-fill'd vase of wine reclined, Told how romance and gaiety combined. And there, like things of immortality, Stood statues, in their master's soul enshrined, Venus with the sweet smile and heavenly eye, And the sad solemn brow of lovely Niobe. And scatter'd round, by wall and sofa, lay Emblems of thoughts that love from earth to spring. Upon a portrait fell the evening ray, Touching with splendour many an auburn ring That veil'd a brow of snow; and crimsoning The bending Spanish cheek with living rose; And there lay a guitar, whose silvery string Breathed to the wind; like beauty in repose; Sighing the lovely sounds that bade her blue eye close. EPITAPH. “Thou thy worldly task hast done.” Shakspeare. High peace to the soul of the dead, From the dream of the world she has gone! On the stars in her glory to tread, To be bright in the blaze of the throne. In youth she was lovely; and Time, When her rose with the cypress he twined, Left her heart all the warmth of its prime, Left her eye all the light of her mind. The summons came forth,—and she died! Yet her parting was gentle, for those Whom she loved, mingled tears at her side— Her death was the mourner's repose. Our weakness may weep o'er her bier, But her spirit has gone on the wing To triumph for agony here, To rejoice in the joy of its King. SATAN. FROM A PICTURE BY SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE. “Satan dilated stood.” Milton. Prince of the fall'n! around thee sweep The billows of the burning deep. Above thee bends the vaulted fire, Beneath thee bursts the flaming spire. And on thy sleepless vision rise Hell's living clouds of agonies. But thou dost like a mountain stand, The spear unlifted in thy hand; Thy gorgeous eye,—a comet shorn, Calm into utter darkness borne; A naked giant, stern, sublime, Arm'd in despair, and scorning Time. On thy curl'd lip is throned disdain, That may revenge, but not complain: Thy mighty cheek is firm, though pale, There smote the blast of fiery hail. Yet wan, wild beauty lingers there, The wreck of an archangel's sphere. No giant pinions round thee cling, Clouds and the thunder are thy wing. Thy forehead wears no diadem, The king is in thine eye-ball's beam. Thy form is grandeur unsubdued, Sole chief of Hell's dark multitude. Yet, brighter than thy brightest hour, Shall rise in glory and in power, The lowliest of the lowly dead, His ransom'd, who shall bruise thy head, The myriads for His blood forgiven; Kings of the stars, the loved of Heaven! THE PROPHET'S SCIMITAR. I see a tempest in the sky, The clouds are rushing wild and nigh! 'T is dark, and darker still! The moon Is wan, is fiery red, is gone. Along the horizon's edge a ring Of fearful light hangs wavering; Yet all beneath, around, is still, Enchanted all, lake, vale, and hill. Hark to the thunder-peal! 't is past, Scarce echoing on the upward blast. Things in that tossing sky have birth This hour, that bear no stain of earth. The storm descends again! the peal, The lightning's hiss, the whirlwind's swell, At once come deepening on the ear. The cloud is now an amber sphere, That, down a cataract of light, Shoots from the summit of the night; And glorious shapes, along its verge, Like meteors flash, ascend, immerge. The broad black heaven is awed and calm; The earth sends up its breath of balm; The thunder crowns the mountain's brow; The lake's long billow sinks below; All slumbering, far as eye can gaze, In sapphire; one blue, mystic blaze! They come! whence swept that sound so near, So sweet, it pains the mortal ear? A sound that on the spirit flings A spell to open all its springs. That sound thou 'lt hear no more, till rise Thine own white wings in Paradise. List to the song the Genii pour, As from yon orb of clouds they soar, Chaunting alternate, height o'er height, Halo on halo, diamond bright, The strain that told from star to star, They brought the talisman of war; The Prophet's blazing scimitar! GENIE. Allah il Allah! high in heaven, Might to the mightiest be given! Mohammed, prophet, prince, be thine On earth Dominion's master-sign. On thy bold brow no jewell'd band; No sceptre in thy red right hand; Forth, and fulfil thy destiny! The scimitar descends for thee! CHORUS. Hail, holy scimitar! thy steel Is lightning's flash and thunder's peal! GENIE. No mortal force, no earthly flame, Woke in the mine its mighty frame: Its mine was in the tempest's gloom, Its forge was in the thunder's womb, To give its hue the eclipsing moon In brief and bloody splendour shone, The comet, rushing from its steep, Traced through the heaven the steel's broad sweep. CHORUS. Prince of the starry diadem, Where found its blade the burning gleam? GENIE. 'Twas edged upon the living stone That lights the tomb of Solomon; Then, rising, temper'd in the wave, That floats through Mecca's holy cave; Above, upon its hilt, were graven The potent characters of heaven; Then on the footstep of the throne 'Twas laid, it blazed, the charm was done! CHORUS. Now, woe to helm, and woe to shield, That meets its rushing o'er the field. Like dust before its edge shall fail The temper'd sword, the solid mail; Till, like a star, its glories swell In terrors on the Infidel; A sun, foredoom'd to pour its rays Till earth is burning in its blaze! THE SONG OF ANTAR. FROM THE ARABIC. Antar, the great Arabian Epic, has become popular from Mr. Hamilton's admirable translation. Yet the extravagance of the hero's lyrics is perhaps too unlicensed for English poetry. Ibla, I love thee. On my heavy eye Thine flashes, like the lightning on the cloud. I cannot paint thy beauty; for it leaves All picturing pale. Were I to say the moon Looks in her midnight glory like thy brow, Where is the wild, sweet sparkling of thine eye? Or that the palm is like thy stately form, Where is thy grace among its waving boughs? Thy forehead's whiteness is my rising sun; Thine ebon tresses wreathing it like night, Like night bewilder me; thy teeth are pearls, In moist lips rosier than the Indian shell. But now my world is darkness, for thou 'rt gone! Thy look was to my life what evening dews Are to the tamarisk: thy single glance Went swifter, deeper, to thy lover's heart, Than spear or scimitar; and still I gaze Hopeless on thee, as on the glorious moon, For thou, like her, art bright, like her above me. INSCRIPTION ON ALEXANDER OF MACEDON. FROM THE GREEK. “?????? ??? ????? ???????????.” Archiæ Ep. Troy fell with Hector, and no champion's spear, From that o'erwhelming hour, taught Greece to fear. With Alexander perished Pella's name; Thus one great mind is life, and power, and fame. INSCRIPTION FOR THEMISTOCLES. FROM THE GREEK. “???? ????? ?????? ??? ??????.” Germanici Ep. Be Greece her hero's sepulchre, Be Persia's fleets the trophy there, The epitaph be Xerxes' name. The column, Salamis!—to shame The weak ingratitude that gave Themistocles a narrow grave. ROSOLIA. A DRAMATIC SKETCH. “Rammenta chi t'adora Ancora in questo stato.” Adrian, Ludovico. Adr. Ask me no more of her.— The tale is idle,—past—'tis of the things That lie i' the heart, as in a monument; Faded—but holy, not to be disturb'd. Yet 't were not much to say that she was fair, No, nor that when she smiled her smile was sweet, For so said all; nor that her slender form Was touch'd with grace by Nature. Yonder wave, Sinking in lines of silver,—this green stem Bowing its purple clusters o'er our heads; That willow, swaying in the sunset wind, Were but its lifeless images. Lud. I saw her portrait once. 'T was in your sleep: It had escaped your bosom. Adr. Dared you gaze? No eye but mine should have beheld that face; No eye but mine should on that face have wept; No eye but mine should that dead face have loved; For by all else its beauty were profaned. It was my secret pleasure, pain, hope, fear, My life's deep mystery. Lud. It was beautiful, And I half wonder'd, stranger as I was, To find my heart so waken'd by that smile. Adr. It could not show Rosolia. See those streaks Painting the western clouds; the living flush That dyes their white with crimson of the rose; And there, the zone of burnish'd hyacinth, That streams across the crimson like a wave; There is the summer beauty of her cheek With the rich tress that veil'd it. When I sat Beneath her eye, I felt it on my heart Like a bright spell. 'Tis not the blaze of gems, Nor vesper starlight, nor aught beautiful In this descending sun, or in this world, That can bring back its splendour: 't was a beam Beyond all picturings of earth: a look As we have heard of angels, where no lips Are wanted to give utterance to the thought; Its glance was radiant thought. Yet when her voice Breathed some old melody, or closed the day With her due hymn to the Virgin, I have turn'd Even from the glory of her eye, to weep Tears, painful from delight. I weep no more: My world is done—there shines—Rosolia's grave. REBELLION. ? ??? ?? ????????? ??????? ????? ???? ????????, ?????????? ?????? ??????. Hesiod. I I had a vision: evening sat in gold Upon the bosom of a boundless plain, Cover'd with beauty;—garden, field, and fold, Studding the billowy sweep of ripening grain, Like islands in the purple summer main. And temples of pure marble met the sun, That tinged their white shafts with a golden stain; And sounds of rustic joy, and labour done, Hallow'd the lovely hour, until her pomp was gone. II The plain was hush'd in twilight, as a child Slumbers beneath its slow drawn canopy; But sudden tramplings came, and voices wild And tossings of rude weapons caught the eye; And on the hills, like meteors in the sky, Burst sanguine fires, and ever and anon To the clash'd spears the horn gave fierce reply; And round their beacons trooping thousands shone, Then sank, like evil things, and all was dark and lone. III 'T was midnight; there was wrath in that wild heaven: Earth was sepulchral dark. At once a roar Peal'd round the mountain tops, like ocean driven Before the thunders on the eternal shore: Down rush'd, as if a sudden earthquake tore The bowels of the hills—a flood of fire: Like lava, mingled spears and torches pour, The plain is deluged, higher still and higher Swell blood and flame, till all is like one mighty pyre. IV 'Twas dawn, and still the black and bloody smoke Roll'd o'er the champaign like a vault of stone: But as the sun's slow wheels the barrier broke, He lit the image of a fearful one, Throned in the central massacre, alone— An iron diadem upon his brow, A naked lance beside him, that yet shone Purple and warm with gore, and crouching low, All men in one huge chain, alike the friend and foe. V The land around him, in that sickly light, Show'd like th'upturning of a mighty grave; Strewn with crush'd monuments, and remnants white Of man; all loneliness, but when some slave With faint, fond hand the hurried burial gave, Then died. The Despot sat upon his throne, Scoffing to see the stubborn traitors wave At his least breath. The good and brave were gone To exile or the tomb. Their country's life was done! EPITAPH ON AN OLD CULTIVATOR. FROM THE GREEK. ???? ???? ??? ???????, ?. ?. ?. Earth, to thy flowery bosom take in love Thy ancient worshipper! He led the grove Of olives down yon valley's gentle side. 'T was he who taught the crystal stream to glide With its low murmur round this bowery vine, And wreath'd its mossy fount with eglantine. 'T was his pale hand that crown'd the hill with corn, And planted yon peach orchard; where at morn The winds grow fragrant!—Strew thy earliest bloom, And hallow thy old lover in the tomb. THE ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM. I The air is fill'd with shouts, and trumpets' sounding; A host are at thy gates, Jerusalem. Now is their van the Mount of Olives rounding; Above them Judah's lion-banners gleam, Twined with the palm and olives' peaceful stem. Now swell the nearer sounds of voice and string, As down the hill-side pours the living stream; And to the cloudless heaven Hosannas ring— “The Son of David comes!—the Conqueror—the King!” II The cuirass'd Roman heard; and grasp'd his shield, And rushed in fiery haste to gate and tower; The Pontiff from his battlement beheld The host, and knew the falling of his power: He saw the cloud on Sion's glory lour. Still down the marble road the myriads come, Spreading the way with garment, branch, and flower, And deeper sounds are mingling, “woe to Rome!” “The day of freedom dawns; rise, Israel, from thy tomb.” III Temple of beauty—long that day is done; Thy ark is dust; thy golden cherubim In the fierce triumphs of the foe are gone: The shades of ages on thy altars swim. Yet still a light is there, though wavering dim; And has its holy lamp been watch'd in vain? Or lives it not until the finish'd time, When he who fix'd, shall break his people's chain, And Sion be the loved, the crown'd of God again? IV He comes, yet with the burning bolt unarm'd; Pale, pure, prophetic, God of Majesty! Though thousands, tens of thousands, round him swarm'd, None durst abide that depth divine of eye; None durst the waving of his robe draw nigh. But at his feet was laid the Roman's sword: There Lazarus knelt to see his King pass by; There Jairus, with his age's child, adored. “He comes, the King of Kings: Hosanna to the Lord!” THE LILY OF THE VALLEY. White bud, that in meek beauty so dost lean Thy cloister'd cheek as pale as moonlight snow, Thou seem'st beneath thy huge, high leaf of green, An Eremite beneath his mountain's brow. White bud! thou 'rt emblem of a lovelier thing, The broken spirit that its anguish bears To silent shades, and there sits offering To Heaven the holy fragrance of its tears. THE PAINTER. RUSTICUS loquitur. That rock's his haunt.—There's not in all our hills A hunter that can climb with him. He 'll watch Before the lark is up; and, staff in hand, For hours stand gazing, by the eagle's nest, Like one enamour'd of the rising sun. And then he 'll make his couch beside a rill: Which, in his fantasy, he strews with shells, And hangs with garlands of the weedy flowers. Some think him love-crost;—others, that he deals With spirits,—for all such seek loneliness: And yet I think him holy, for he loves Our convent walls, and many an evening strays To see the sunset sleeping on its roof And its old arches; or but turns away To pore upon its image in the stream; And then he 'll spread his book upon his knee, And make a thousand things of beauty, then He 'll tear the page, and fling it down the wind. Here's one of them.— STRANGER. This is Lorraine; or he is not on earth. JACOB'S DREAM. FROM A PICTURE BY ALLSTON. I The sun was sinking on the mountain zone That guards thy vales of beauty, Palestine! And lovely from the desert rose the moon, Yet lingering on the horizon's purple line, Like a pure spirit o'er its earthly shrine. Up Padan-aram's height abrupt and bare A pilgrim toil'd, and oft on day's decline Look'd pale, then paused for eve's delicious air, The summit gain'd, he knelt, and breathed his evening prayer. II He spread his cloak and slumber'd—darkness fell Upon the twilight hills; a sudden sound Of silver trumpets o'er him seem'd to swell; Clouds heavy with the tempest gather'd round; Yet was the whirlwind in its caverns bound; Still deeper roll'd the darkness from on high, Gigantic volume upon volume wound, Above, a pillar shooting to the sky, Below, a mighty sea, that spread incessantly. III Voices are heard—a choir of golden strings, Low winds, whose breath is loaded with the rose; Then chariot-wheels—the nearer rush of wings; Pale lightning round the dark pavilion glows, It thunders—the resplendent gates unclose; Far as the eye can glance, on height o'er height, Rise fiery waving wings, and star crown'd brows, Millions on millions, brighter and more bright, Till all is lost in one supreme, unmingled light. IV But, two beside the sleeping Pilgrim stand, Like cherub Kings, with lifted, mighty plume, Fix'd, sun-bright eyes, and looks of high command: They tell the Patriarch of his glorious doom; Father of countless myriads that shall come, Sweeping the land like billows of the sea, Bright as the stars of heaven from twilight's gloom, Till He is given whom Angels long to see, And Israel's splendid line is crown'd with Deity. ON THE RUINS OF MESOLONGHI. Glorious spirits! ye have past; On the ground your blood is cast, Tower and bastion, all are won. Round the new Thermopylæ Lies the gore, and lies the clay, To high heaven the soul is gone! Flow my tears! No, let no tear Stain the slumbers of that bier, Till the tear of blood shall come. None o'er you the turf must spread; Naked lie, ye gallant dead, Naked, wait the hour of doom. Shame to Europe! On her ear Night and day, and month and year, While arose your agony; While before the Ottoman Christian blood in torrents ran, She could calmly see you die! Shame to Europe! when her hand Could have crush'd that ruffian band, Like the worm beneath her feet! Let her now bemoan, bepraise,— Will it quench your rampart's blaze? Will it rend your winding sheet? Gold and empire, mighty things! What are ye when Time's wild wings Smite ye, as he rushes on! Down go sceptre, sword, and bust; Babylon is dust to dust. Rome is worthless, widow'd, lone! But, till Earth shall groan her last, Ne'er shall be this spot o'erpast, Eyes shall weep, and hearts shall swell; Aye, and flame with freedom's flame, When is heard its fated name, Sublime, indelible. Down shall go your murderer's reign Like an universal stain; Down the turban'd head shall go. Come the stroke from Man or Heaven, Blood shall for your blood be given, Woe be measured for your woe! Mesolonghi; till the day Of the pillar'd earth's decay, Thou shalt be a holy shrine. Wreck'd and ruin'd as thou art, Consecrated to the heart, Glory be to thee and thine! INSCRIPTION FOR A GROTTO. A.D. 1500. O, Filiæ vespertinæ, blandæ, adeste, Aura, Stella, Luna! Come, eveninge gale! the crimsonne rose Is droopinge for thy sighe of dewe, The hyacinthe wooes thy kisse to close In slumberre sweete its eye of blue. Shine, eveninge starre! the valley-streame Hath loste the tinges of the sunne, And lingers for thy pearlie beame, To telle its bosome daye is done. Rise, eveninge moone! thy holie raye To telle of heavenlie houres is given, Whenne earthe shall on our eye decaye, And alle our pathe, like thine, be heavenne. THE SIBYL'S TOMB. FROM THE GREEK. ??? ?? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????? ??? ???????? ????, ??? ???????? ??? ??????.— “??? ??? ? ??????? ?????????.” Pausanias—“Phocic.” I was the Sibyl!—In this marble cell Sleep the pale lips that breathed the oracle. Death's sceptre stoop'd upon my virgin brow; Then voice and beauty fled! All's silent now. Yet still with Hermes and the Nymphs I rove, Elysian spirit!—I was Phœbus' love. LINES ON THE DEATH OF HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE. “Consules, et Senatus, ac magna pars populi viam complevere, disjecti, et ut cuique libitum, flentes.—Dies, quo reliquiæ tumulo inferebantur, modo per silentium vastus, modo ploratibus inquies: plena Urbis itinera, conlucentes per Campum Martis faces: illic miles cum armis, sine insignibus magistratus, populus per tribus, concidisse rempublicam, clamitabant, promptius, apertiusque, quàm ut meminisse imperitantium crederes.” Tacit. in Mort. Germanici. I. We are immortals! Earth to us is vain; The lesson of our vigour must be pain. Is the world in thee still, thy heart a tide Still rolling with the gusts of passion, pride?— Go to the house of mourning! see the eye, Rais'd in its meek submissiveness, to die; The bloom, like roses once, now sunk and sere; Check not the tear; there's virtue in that tear. 'T is not in mockery thus that Death betrays His footsteps; 'tis to force,—to fix our gaze. Go to the house of mourning! Is there one, Dear to such thoughts as manly hearts may own, Some soft, fair, high soul'd being, that thy heart Has treasured like a virtue, pure, apart— Stand by her death-bed! is one folly thine? Can it resist that beauty's pale decline? Is thy heart yet unchasten'd, yet a slave To earth's dark passions?—stand beside her grave! But when the lesson must awake a land, It bears the impress of th'eternal hand; Lean Famine o'er her millions spreads his pall, Pale Pestilence breathes upon them, and they fall; Or is there one, their idol, bright, pure, dear, So loved,—the single blow were deadly there; It rushes like the midnight thunder-ball, Her diadem is struck at once, for all. Earth has no mightier wisdom than the cry Sent from that grave,—that all is vanity. II. 'T was night; but there were thoughts in England's breast Too wild, too waking for its hour of rest; The strong anxieties of hope and fear, That must be joy or woe ere morn appear. Man loves the throne!—'t is not the glare of power; Flatterers may fawn before it, dastards cower, The free-soul'd feel the homage that they feign: That morn might England hail a Sovereign! But, round the couch where England's daughter lies Are hovering all the heart's high sympathies. And thousands, tens of thousands that had ne'er Look'd on the face, now pale in peril there, Were sleepless through her long, drear hours of pain, And sent up hopes and prayers,—in vain—in vain. By Claremont's walls in deepening circles wait The royal courier, equipage of state; And broadly through the dusk the torches glow On crowds, that hour by hour like billows flow, Still, as from time to time the portals ope, Rushing to catch the menial's tale of hope; As spurs the muffled horseman through the gate, Perusing in his face the nation's fate. The hour's at hand!—a moment—and they fling The shout to heaven, the shout for Ocean's king! No shout was given. In Claremont's chambers now Tears fall from eyes not used to their light flow; A group are bending round a canopy, With man's reluctant tear and struggling sigh; Prelate and chief are there, a stately ring, Pondering on fate: there lies their infant King!— And now,—that pillow's all his sovereign throne; 'T is Death's cold lip has kiss'd him,—he is gone. III. Spirits who sit in glory! if ye brook To look below, 't is on such hours ye look. The round of fate was sweeping; woe or joy To millions hung on that Imperial boy; Earth's furthest bound, earth's final age might feel This moment's impulse of the mighty wheel. If angels sorrow, deathless eyes were wan That midnight for the blighted hopes of man. There lies posterity! that babe belong'd To times still coming, when our forms had throng'd The populous grave. Of all the myriad eyes Once fix'd to see his star of empire rise, Not one might see his height, all must be laid Beamless, ere nature plunged his orb in shade; A hundred years of change, and still his hand Might hold the changeless sceptre, crush, command; What miracles beyond life's broadest span, Might by that mind be wrought for earth and man! All sunk at once in that dead babe—subdued, Collapsed, the whole proud, vast vicissitude! Time will not sleep; the storm has left a tide; The pestilence has but slept, it has not died! The fire ferments below, it yet shall blaze— Earth shall have one wild pang ere it decays. One evil throne has sunk, a mightier ban Shall rise with darker vengeance against man! And must the nations perish, till, once more, The encountering signs, the red-cross standards soar? All lost or saved, as one brave heart shall spring To the world's breach, our children's children's king! But thou! thy laurel's planted in the grave, Thou 'lt sleep while earth is rocking like a wave. Yet many a brow that wore the golden round Might wish its sleep as early and as sound: Earth brought to thee, pale child, nor grief, nor stain; Death was release, the breaking of a chain; Summon'd to life without life's suffering, A moment loosed for Heaven the spirit's wing. IV. The sigh, but not the sorrow pass'd; for there Were tremblings for another sufferer. Yet in the palace all seem'd quickly calm, No hurrying taper on the darkness swam, No echo on the gusty air was borne, Now chiller with the coming of the morn. Dimness and silence all, but where the gloom Hung fainter round the ray from one high room, That seem'd a room of slumber; deep the fold Through which the struggling light in crimson roll'd. If slumber, 't was soon past! a woman's cry Was heard within! 't was pain, 't was agony! Then all was tumult;—on the casements sweep Swift lights, shapes hast'ning, as but sprung from sleep; Down come the rushing menials, opes the porch, Sad and short tidings theirs,—the courier's torch Sweeps, like a meteor o'er a midnight flood, The rollings of the deep, sad multitude. But in that fateful room the agony Soon passed; and but a sudden, passing sigh, Some pang that heaved, and scarcely heaved the breast; All now was calm, subdued, for final rest! There the young mother in her beauty lay, Patient, till life's slow pulse should ebb away; Smiles on her pale lip still, her eye unmoved, To its last dimness fix'd on him she loved. V. Oh how unlike the hour of festival! That chamber, how unlike the gorgeous hall, Which saw that hand of faith and fondness given; 'T was on a summer day's delicious even. Propitious splendour in the purpling skies, The air all streaming with rich harmonies, Sent in with fragrance of the closing flower, Old England's royal pomp in court and bower! The hall was thick with regal luxury;— Studding like stars the dome, that look'd a sky, Cressets of alabaster and of gold, Waked all that pencil, or that steel could mould. Central, beside the altar, on her throne, Sat, diadem'd, the mother-queen, alone. And round her, hush'd in awful distance, stood Young beauty, haughty forms of field and flood, Chiefs, who shall be a glory to all time, Mix'd with soft shapes, like roses in their prime. VI. There is a love! 't is not the wandering fire That must be fed on folly, or expire; Gleam of polluted hearts, the meteor-ray That fades, as rises Reason's nobler day; But passion made essential, holy, bright; Like the raised dead, our dust transform'd to light; But, the rich foretaste of a loftier clime, Friendship of souls, in heaven scarce more sublime! Earth has its pangs for all; its happiest breast Not his who meets them least, but bears them best. Life must be toil! yet oh, that toil how drear, But for this soother of its brief career, The charm that virtue, beauty, fondness, bind, Till the mind mingles with its kindred mind! 'Tis not the cold romancer's ecstasy, The flame new lit at every passing eye, But the high impulse that the stately soul Feels slow engross it, but engross it whole; Yet seeks it not, nay, turns with stern disdain On its own weakness that can wear a chain; Still wrestling with the angel, till its pride Feels all the strength departed from its side. Then, join'd, and join'd for ever,—loving, loved, Life's darkest hours are met, and met unmoved; Hand link'd in hand, the wedded pair pass on Through the world's changes, still unchanging, one; On earth one heart, one hope, one joy, one gloom, One closing hour, one, undivided tomb! Mysterious union! was thy beauty made To sink with life's weak shades, itself a shade? Was it for this thy glorious train was given? High virtues, then first stooping from their heaven, Round thee, and thee alone, on earth to move; Holy fidelity, pure peace, true love; Veil'd here,—yet emanations of a throne Loftier than man's dull'd eye dares gaze upon. Thou Paraclete! through earth's long pilgrimage Shelter of infancy, support of age! Man stain'd or sunk, as thy white wing was dim; Till at His coming whom the Seraphim Hymn'd to the shepherds from the midnight skies, Thou heard'st the call that bade the world arise; And He, life's glory, death's captivity, Shew'd his first might to honour, hallow thee “There was a marriage in Cana of Galilee.” (John II.) The Christian commandment against polygamy was a principle of total change in the condition of the sex. Paganism made them prisoners. Mahommedism makes them slaves. It might have been in some degree with reference to this great reform that Cana was honoured with the first miracle.: And thou wert hallowed, and from life's dull gloom Shone out the heart, the holiness of home. From that high hour, no more a toy or slave,— Woman, life's flow'ret, shared the peace she gave; Nature was purity, and faith was love, The Spirit had descended as a dove! And shall thy gentle mission finish here? Thou angel,—more than angel minister! To whom youth's passion, manhood's burning zeal, All that the heart, the wild, fond heart, can feel, Turn, as the billow to the midnight moon, In proud submission to thy heavenly throne; Guide, soother, saviour, to life's final shore, Shall then, oh then, thy task of love be o'er! VII. Morn came in clouds; the tempest's heavy swell Stoop'd ominous; it bore no birthday peal! Egypt! when Heaven's high wrath thy heart assail'd, And o'er its wrath that heart of stone prevail'd, Where smote the final plague, the conquering woe? 'T was in the sword that laid thy first-born low! Guilt was on England, and the blow was given On England's heart,—in mercy be it, Heaven! That morn the mighty city silence kept; Grief was upon her, and her spirit wept. 'T was no dissembled woe; the sudden stroke, Strong as an earthquake, on her hope had broke; That morn she sat beneath the hand of fate, In sackcloth on the dust, pale, desolate. Yet, she had wept before; the glorious grave More glorious by the tribute that she gave; But o'er this bier a deeper anguish thrill'd, A fonder tear was shed;—she wept her child. There lay the nation's nurseling! lingering years Had roll'd away of parent hopes and fears; She saw her reach life's golden height; and now She saw Joy's richest chaplet o'er her brow; Another day, an hour,—posterity Had smiled, and bless'd her!—It was not to be! She fell! and there was in that sudden fall Some sorrow that came heavy, home to all,— The high prophetic fears, that in the range Of dark'ning years prefigured empire's change; The parent hearts that shared a parent's woe; And ev'n the ruder eyes which saw that blow But prostrate a young, lovely one, so nigh The prize of life, a mother's ecstasy; England! how many bosoms on that morn Wept inly! Nay, what sterner pangs were borne! With what a sudden, shuddering sympathy The father on his daughter turn'd his eye! He saw the glance of joy, the ripen'd bloom, And saw them—but the signals for the tomb. On his young wife the husband's shaded look Betray'd how deep within the omen strook; The pallid mother, as her hour drew near, Shrank from the pang with more than nature's fear; The self-same flash had wrapt the cot and throne, 'Twas prince and people's heart—bound—pierced in one. VIII. Midnight was on the earth; the zenith moon Shone out in cloudless pomp, broad, lovely, lone The sounds of man were silent; on the hill, Along the vale, all but the breeze was still, And it was but the breath that served to shake Sighs and sweet murmurings from the hawthorn brake; The vault above was sapphire, heavenly blue, The brightness that the eye seems looking through When the eye is half mind; and wild, and far, As if it found a guide in each lone star, It wanders through the heaven, rapt, dreaming on To the bright gates where all it loved are gone. But hark! a bell's slow toll! and far below Winds through the moonlight vale a train of woe. The pomp is royal; on the nearer glance Move sable riders, glitter helm and lance; Thunders the heavy gun; beneath the trees Wave banners; tall, dark plumage meets the breeze; And now glares out—a hearse!—her shadowy throne Whose palace is the grave,—the last, chill one! The train moved up the hill; though on it stood That anxious night the countless multitude, There was no voice among them; tears must tell— What words have never told,—the heart's farewell IX. Death, thou art terrible! 't is not the sting Of the mere sense that makes thy suffering; 'T is not the pang, the thirst, the midnight groan; Though all their host do homage to thy throne; Thy terrors live in thy dark mystery, All crowded in the one drear thought—we die! We see the dying struggle,—all thus far Is plain; up springs at once the mighty bar, Gloomy as night; no twilight upper ray Helps out the image of its further day. And is this all;—the worm, the hideous sleep That makes the very flesh by instinct creep. Who that beside the opening tomb has stray'd, And borne to see the gambols of the spade, While the slave scoffing in the trench below Flings up some fearful thing at every throw; Felt not within, however fortified By holy truth, however fool'd by pride, A shock, a shrinking of the natural heart, Lest there at last might lie his better part; Ev'n with those whiten'd bones, that half changed clay, That grinning skull, that coffin's loose decay? Felt not the question with his spirit strive, “Were not these—men? and can these dry bones live?” Must all his dreams of high futurity Be finish'd here, and that vile thing—be he; Can soul be but a phantasy, a breath; Can dust, air, stillness, nothingness, be death? Yet there are sensual fools, (high Heaven!) that brave, Nay boast to scorn (they 'll know it yet,) the grave. What is their courage? blindness! Could their eye But glance upon its drear immensity, The terrors that like clouds upon it ride, The billows that have no returning tide; Then should we see, like babes, those taunters shrink, Who now dance madly on the crumbling brink; See those rebound in horror, who now vie In cold, gross, guilty carelessness—to die! It has a Ruler! woe to him who treads But where his hand across its darkness leads. But one—but one of all men, on the grave Can fix his vision, and be wisely brave; He—who has felt the spirit's inward chain, And struggled, ev'n when struggle seem'd in vain; Who, fainting, prayed;—fall'n, wept;—from his low knee Sent looks to heaven not meant for man to see; Till came their answer! till sublimed, subdued, His spirit burn'd,—one holy habitude! X. We know the moment comes, that comes the last— When all is merged in one wild word,—the past! And all thenceforth is new; a mighty scene Of strange, bright, wonderful, that hath not been. We've climb'd life's weary hill; the early plain, Track'd as it was by many a step of pain, Seen from that lofty brow, is seen—a span! Beside, behind us, rush the host of man; Before us, all is precipice; the eye Strains but through depth on depth,—infinity! On rush the host, like waves, like armies mown In the red field,—in rank on rank hurl'd down; Each, as it meets the edge, in sudden fear Sway'd backward, but a mightier hand is there; In vain the wild recoil, sad gesture, groan; Myriads are on their heels, and they must on. Princess of England! on thy head was laid The moral, that all under Heaven is shade: Who murmurs at his lot, yet sees thee there? Who hears thy tale, yet feels no righteous fear? We 're made in fearfulness; some fine, frail thing, Some nameless, viewless fibre, checks life's spring, And now—an empire's tears could not recall The stately beauty sleeping in that pall; Not worlds give back the smile, that as she lay Consoled an empire's heart—but yesterday. Deep mystery! we wake with Heaven's sole breath; Ten thousand, thousand ways lead down to death! Why form'd with such rich waste, so high, so frail, So near to angel, dust upon the gale? Thou dreamer! Earth was never meant to hold The wing, that every breath can thus unfold. Is the sphere gloomy round us?—day and night Stand wide its countless portals to the light; Earth has no barrier to the immortal plume; “Hereafter,” is the motto of the tomb! XI. Then—comes the burst, the vision, broad awake To see, what, thought on, makes the reason shake. Mountains! where are ye! nay, thou grave! to hide Our glance from all the dazzling, grand, untried! A pang,—a moment—and we 've burst the pall Where all o'erwhelms; impress'd immortal, all! How shall we melt in homage, as move by The regal people of eternity! Deep shuddering, as we think, how oft, how near, Viewless,—they cross'd us in their high career:— Kings of the elements! that now, embrow'd With majesty, expand from fire and cloud; In our mad hours what witnesses look'd on, What godlike might! yet were we not undone; Shall we, like infants upon Ocean's shore, Startled from sleep amid the tempest's roar, Wild-waking, withering, behold unveil'd The secrets that the deep of deeps has held? Redemption, seraph mysteries, things that Earth Was born, heaven shaken, but to bring to birth; The wheels, within whose thundering sweep mankind Moved, yet were crush'd not; moved, in mercy, blind; Fate's vast machinery, orbits, blaze on blaze, Yet midnight to His lone pavilion's rays! Or shall we meet the parted heart,—for Love, Heaven's last best gift cannot decay above; The hallow'd heart, whose life, whose very grave Gave us the lofty thoughts Earth never gave; And made our spirit doubly purified, To hope the hope, to die the death she died? Oh! shall we, in the shadow of her wing, Be veil'd and sooth'd, till Heaven's high feelings spring In the faint soul;—till changed, from height to height It soars, all boundless vision, beauty, light, All that foretold th'immortal in our sphere, Faith, friendship, love, but buds, to flourish there, A crown'd and sceptred glory, brightening on Still nearer to the throne,—a father's throne! XII. The bier has left the hall,—has pass'd the court,— Has enter'd, slow and dim, the Chapel's porte; Silence is now for sound; for lustre, gloom; Dim, in long, moveless lines, gleam lance and plume; The flag is furl'd, the sabre in its sheath, All is the hush'd magnificence of death. Yet pale and partial flashes from the moon, Toiling through mist-wreaths now, are downwards thrown, Edging with silver, like a tempest-cloud, The Chapel's gloomy arch, the thick-group'd crowd, That stand with upturn'd eyes, and shapes like stone, Watching the casements where the bier has gone. Within are solemn sights, and on the air Come from the dim cathedral, hymn and prayer, The rites of love and sorrow, where the heart Hopes against hope,—streams blood,—yet dares to part; And, as the earth strikes on the coffin, thinks, Though at the sound the inmost spirit shrinks, How surely and how soon that clay shall be Glorious,—that pale, cold prisoner be free. Glorious and free thou art! we idly weep: Earth has not kept thee, was not made to keep. The pure have but brief trial,—Joy is theirs At once!—they have the privilege of years! They ask not our slow discipline to rise, Angels ev'n here—Death gives at once the prize. The choral hymn was past, and past the prayer, That from a thousand voices fill'd the air, Like one ascending of their hearts to heaven;— Then—to the Giver was the treasure given! The bier began to sink before their eye, Slow as a spectre, dimly, silently: The crown,—the empty crown—still gleam'd; once more All gazed, all wept—it sank—the rite was o'er. XIII. Yet if a prayer could hasten destiny, Were it not well in her bright hour to die— The world at peace, or held in righteous fear!— Man's pride, and strength,—her England's matchless spear? She should have died hereafter! no, not now, Not thus have made our cup with tears o'erflow. The holy cause had triumph'd,—England's car Came, rich with trophies of her mightiest war; Monarchs were in her train; above her van Blazed the deliver'd cross, the ark of man; And she stood forth, first, fairest stood, to hail That day;—at once the victor's cheek was pale, The triumph was eclipsed; was she the price? The daughter vow'd? the bright, sad sacrifice? “And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and behold his daughter came out to meet him . . . . “And it came to pass, when he saw her, he rent his clothes, and said, alas, my daughter!” Judges, C. XI.— Ev'n in the hour when England's parent eye Turn'd from its glory on her,—must she die! END OF VOLUME SECOND.</field>
