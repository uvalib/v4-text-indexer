      <field name="fulltext">A POEM, WRITTEN TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR 1794, UPON A PROSPECT OF THE MARRIAGE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES. Season of darkness and contracted day, Inclement Winter, whose approaching foot Treads on the heel of Autumn, pause; nor strew With thy rude gust the ill-surviving leaf Which hangs discoloured upon hill and vale. Still let the mellow-beam'd October orb Protract its influence, and unobscured Shed softest comfort round us; till decay Seem lovely, and the sickly hues of Earth Resigning all her beauty, please not less Than the mild exit of the tranquil sage Who smiles and disappears, and his white locks Contented yields to the none-sparing grave. Impending Season, to the frozen north Bid thy strong gale and low redundant cloud, Whose gloom down-stooping ev'ry hill-top sweeps, Retreat: O'er Hyperborean regions shed Thy feathery show'r, and drift it with thy breath. Bind other streams with ice, and other lakes Make firm as rock with thy congealing frown: Elsewhere be tyrannous, but gentle here: Here smile serene; and let incautious Spring, Decoyed or e'er her season, on thy brow An odorous chaplet place of early buds, And deck with blossoms thy snow-sprinkled crown. Be gay, dull Season; and inspired at length By ling'ring Autumn and returning Spring Learn all their dance and be as brisk as they. Let the cold sceptre from thy hand depart; And Spring be Queen instead, to welcome home Brunswick's fair daughter, and before her strew All vernal beauty on the British shore. Meantime shalt thou, kind Season, the rude deep Sooth with thine out-stretched arm; and bid the waves That wildly furious their confounded power Tumble, far-sounding in the midnight gale, Upon the rocks of Britain, yet awhile Their foaming frenzy curb, and lave the shore With impulse inoffensive; murmur soft Repose inducing more than stillest calm: Then, tilting o'er the flood with streamers gay And ev'ry sail unfurled, pilot the fleet Which bears to Britain for her Prince a gem; Freight thrice more precious than Peruvian gale E'er wafted to Iberia. When her eye Above the dancing tide the steady spot First notes, which Britain's heav'n-aspiring soil Proclaims apparent, thy dark cloud withdraw, Wont on its brow to rest; and shed alone Far-distant sunshine on its milky head: In beams of purest day clothe ev'ry cliff Slow-mounting o'er the waves; and, as the port Extends to welcome her his ample arms, With shouting thousands crowd the peopled shore. Their loud huzza let the proud bark repeat To ev'ry fellow vessel; and at once All, as they pass, to either echoing shore In flame, in thunder, and redounding smoke, Their prosp'rous embassy announce. Around Albion's firm barrier let the throat of war The tidings bellow, till they reach thy ear, Victorious Howe, and kindle all thy fires. So shall Britannia at the loud applause Of her own thunder quake, and think what pow'r Could her indignant navy then withstand, Intrepid warrior, when thy ev'ry port Blazed death, and to the swift pernicious bolt Gave wings that swept the war-encumber'd deep And to the bottom sent her proud foe down. Welcome, fair Princess, welcome to the shore Thy Parent left reluctant. Reap thou here Comfort's full harvest, by the hand of heaven Placed on no isle forlorn, no desert rock, No land of savages, no nest of slaves, No kennel bloody of infernal hounds Who bark for Freedom, and with tyrant mouths Ere Freedom enters pull her to the ground: Here Prince and People liberty alike Give and receive, partake, and all enjoy. Welcome, fair Princess, and be thy approach The harbinger and promise of ere long The dear return of renovated Peace. Arise, Great God of Battles, Lord of Hosts, Come down, Almighty Warrior, bow the heavens, The cloudy chariot of salvation mount; And let the stedfast empyrean burn Under thy glowing wheels. Thy flashing spear Brandish indignant o'er the cowering earth, And send thy bickering arrows round the world: Stir up the deep, and his uplifted wave Pour headlong, flound'ring, against rock and cliff Till ev'ry barrier fail, and the wild surge Its foamy dance pursue, besieging close And leveling earth's ramparts; the proud hold But weak asylum of transgressor man: Descend and touch the mountains. Let them smoke, Shudder, and roar, beneath thy blazing car. And when thy march begins from isle to isle, O'er continent and deep, all boundaries In turn high-over-passing, and in turn All kingdoms visiting, let ev'ry isle, Let ev'ry mountain, precipice, and hill, Melt at the pressure of thy sultry foot: Scatter all nations with the lighting down Of thy sulphureous arm: Asunder drive them, Never to meet and levy wars again. Utter thy glorious voice, shake earth and heaven, And thunder-drive thy foes to utmost hell. Let ancient earth, too guilty to sustain Thy frown and footstep, to her centre mourn Shot through with agony. Rock to and fro' Her everduring pillars, her strong base Dissolve, and like a cottage let her reel, Earthquake beneath, whirlwind and storm above: Vex and confound her like the struggling bark Which shatter'd, rudderless, before the gale Stoops, and, exposing her unshelter'd side To ocean's high-wrought fury, ill sustains The foamy mantling billow that o'ershoots And pours his roaring cataract upon her. Nor let her live but as that sinking bark Which hopeless, shuddering, from the troubled gulf That yawns to swallow her fear-founder'd crew, Through the bright rift of the quick-posting cloud Lifts up to thee the supplicating eye And mute petition, which thy anger stays And smooths her passage to the port she sought. Father Omnipotent, assert thy son And give him all dominion. Bow the neck Of unbelieving Gallia to his yoke, The yoke of freedom. Vindicate the blood Of her slain innocent, the martyr'd Prince, Assassinated widow, murder'd maid, Whose crime was only to be born of Kings. Lift up the fatherless, the brazen doors Of his dark dungeon burst, and let the Prince Share with his people what thou gav'st to all Dear liberty. No longer live a slave, A tyrant live no longer, people, Kings; All free and happy; by no fetters bound Save those which only devils scorn to wear, Chains of religion, rectitude, and faith— Fetters expedient, chains imposed on all, And only galling to the daring wretch Who longs, like Lucifer, to blaze and fall Pre-eminent in crime. Heav'n speed the day When Pity shall unbar his Prison gates, And Gallia welcome from his dark abode Her orphan, innocent, insulted, King. Arise, brave nation, and assert his cause: Crush the fell hydra which thy dearest blood Laps conscience-proof. Dare an Herculean task To die or to extinguish all her heads. One tyrannous Bastile your hands have razed: Another grinds you. Under-delve the pile, And scare all Europe with the thund'ring blow Whose vast explosion proclaims Gallia free. Horrible consistory, reeking troop Of slaughter-fed assassins, wading deep In your own country's blood, lavishly shed To gratify ambition, abject fear, Revenge, and jealousy, and tyrant hate, Be Louis free as you are; free to sway A righteous sceptre; but not free, like you, To sup profusely of a nation's blood, Dooming to confiscation and swift death, Death without respite, death without reprieve, Legions of innocent, of rich, and great— Legions whose all transgression was to wear, What best became them, hearts rebellion-proof, Scorning desertion from a trampled Prince— Legions that bore, and bore without offence, Titles of princely favour, to record Some deed of high renown erewhile atchieved By their brave ancestry—Legions whose crime Was to possess revenues, which your hands, To murder, theft, and sacrilege, inured, Had plundered from them ere ye doomed their throats To the broad knife which hungers for your own. Thou dread Requiter of all wrongs below, Give to the mounted scale, which soars so high And touches heav'n with its aspiring beam, Momentum vast; and to the lowest deep Plumb let it drop. As swiftly to the skies Raise the depress'd, and be confirmed by all War's awful arbiter and King of Kings. Once more let Gallia, faithful, the sweet dawn Of restoration welcome; and her Prince Rise from his dungeon, like the orb of day From the dark confines of tempestuous night. Let his mild presence cheer-whate'er the storm Has in his absence wreck'd; it's dying gust Sooth into calm; its separating cloud Disperse with smiles, and dissipate the dews Which drop so largely from the weeping branch. Return those happy days when willing France Welcomed her Antoinette, as Britain now Brunswick's fair issue to her laughing isle. Let Gallia's Prince his blooming bride receive, And Gallia hail him as Britannia hails Her George, and bids him prosper. Prince beloved, May no rude shock thy earthly peace disturb. Vanish before thee machination deep, And dark conspiracy that veils her cheek— E'en from the moon-beam. Like thy prosp'rous sire Assassination's poisoned dart, that spares Not virtue's self, defy; the brittle knife Of blind insanity, and pike concealed Under the cloak of treason; while, like his, Thy shelter is the hollow of Heav'n's shield, Heav'n's arm thy confidence. Stand fast, like him, In Christian panoply secure, nor fear While virtue girds thee, and religion's helm Nods o'er thy brow; for hosts omnipotent Shall camp about thee, and immortal bands, That slumber never, foil and repel thy foe. Surrounded by their armies earthly prince Is castled stronger, be the field his fort, Than in the proudest battlements shell-proof Where virtue not attends him. What though Hell Her murky legions round about him pour, Hell fire his ramparts, Hell in her own smoke Cloud his recoiling bastions, Hell direct His molten sleet, Hell shower upon the foe His pond'rous hail intense, yet shall he fall. But blaze at once from her unnumber'd mouths All Earth, and blaze at once all Hell from her's, Amid the flaming volley, though it plough Earth as a furrow'd field, the righteous lives. Live long religious Monarch. May thy throne The rude concussion of all storms withstand; And be, like thee, thy progeny secure In their own goodness. As thou sitst above, Superior to misfortune, like the cape Or cloud-girt promontory high in air Which ocean saps in vain, in vain assaults With countless myriads of insurgent waves Loud thund'ring, so prevail thy happy race. Heav'n's smile for ever on their foreheads rest, His storm sail far beneath; the salient deep Pour his wild waters at their feet, unfeared; Nor aught avail, save by incessant fall To smooth and beautify the stedfast rock, Which breasts his indignation tempest-proof Nor feels the fury of the proudest surge. Prince, be thy fortune as thy father's fair, And share, like him, whatever bliss can flow From life connubial. And while thou apart Sweet peace domestic, peace as sweet enjoy Britannia rescued from her ancient foe By her own awful arm. An iron sleep Close the grim ports of war. An iron sleep Fall on his bulwarks. His infernal throat That erst breathed fire and cloud voluminous, Scaring the nations with gigantic boast And instant thunderbolt, in silence dread Lie slumber-seized; and undisturb'd her web 'Cross the still battlement Arachne weave. Shew thyself, mighty Leader, strike the blow Which shall to Britain her lost peace restore; Once more in arms before thy foe appear; And, Brunswick, mark me that the flaming bark Which bears thy awful name, environ'd round By hostile armament, about her dealt No useless thunder ball, but all-subdued Foes oath-bound her consumptive ire to slake Or sink unconquered in the scared abyss. Remember this, great soldier, and present With thy fair daughter to her happy Prince (Portion more precious than the widest realm) The wreath of victory and branch of peace. FINIS.</field>
