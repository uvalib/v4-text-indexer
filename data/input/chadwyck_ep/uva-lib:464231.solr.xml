Primati &amp; Metropolitano dignissimo] If Thee, the Muses sacred Rites that knowes, And from whose Lips pure Attick Hony flowes, These Lyrick Poet's Songs doo not displease, Tun'd (as I could) to my Pipe's homely Laies, But (doom'd to darknes) by thy gracefull Sight Bee brought abroad, to see the gladsome Light; No gleering Scorns I'll fear, nor spitefull Gibes, Nor crabbed Criticks, nor Grammarian Tribes. Thou, thou alone, 'gainst all these Darts shalt bee An Aiax-Shield, and sweet Defence to mee. Amplitudini tuæ, omni observantia devotus, Iohn Ashmore. To my Friend, the Author. To praise Thee, is a Labour to no end; Since those, that read Thee, cannot but Commend. Let Envie read, and Envie will becom A Convert; or, at least, shee will be dum. G. S. To the ingenious Author. Mvch have I read: but, never could I finde A Poëm that so well did please my Minde, As thy sweet Numbers. It is hard to tell, The Matter, or the Manner, which excell. This Work of Thine, with such Perfection fram'd, So Scholler-like, may Others make asham'd (When they reflect upon thy Straines their sight) To publish their Composures to the Light. Let no brow-bended envious Carper say, That my Affection made my Iudgement stray. Such Stateliness doth in thy Poëms dwell, That what thou writ'st but few can Parallel. Thomas Cordin. [Grac't by the Muses, Poët most expert] Grac't by the Muses, Poët most expert, My Praises cannot equall thy Desert. My ravisht Soule thy rare Straines doth admire, And thy sweet Muses high aspiring fire. Come Poëts; and his temples Crown with Bayes: Not many have, or can write better Layes. R. I. CERTAIN SELECTED ODES OF Horace TRANSLATED. Ad Mecænatem. Lib. 1. Ode prima. The Argvment. That many a way, most men assay Their heads up high to raise: Which he neglects, and most affects A Lyrick Poets praise. The English answereth the Latine, in Lines and syllables. Mecænas, of the race of Kings thy grandsires, bred, O thou my chief support, &amp; garland of my head; Some with Olympian dust besmeard delight to ride In Chariots, and the burning wheeles with skill to guide Fast by the mark, whom victory and palms of praise, With shouts unto the gods, Lords of the earth, doth raise. This man's puft up, if fickle Romans doe agree To reare him up with stiles of three-fold dignitie. If he in Garners safely have laid up in store His corne from Affrick brought, he careth for no more. He that in peace at home delights his Land to till, On no condition unto him proposed, will Turne Mariner, and feare-full with a Cyprian plank Cut out a way through hils and dales of billowes rank. The Marchant, fearing windes that in th'Icarian Seas Doe wrastle in great rage, the countrey life doth praise, And their town fields: Then straight his shake-ship doth repair, Vntaught the scorn-full wrongs of poverty to bear. In froathing boawles of generous wine he healths doth drink, And busies not his brain, of State affaires to think; But careless under th'Arbute shade sometime he lies, Somtime by th'holy well where bubbling waters rise. In camps entrencht &amp; trumpets sound som men delight, And in stiff shocks of bloody wars that matrons fright. The huntsman stayes ith' cold with hazard of his life, Vnmindfull how hee left his young and tender wife; Whether his trustie Dogges pursue the fleeing Deer, Or the revenge-full Boars the toyles asunder teare. The Ivie wreathes, rewards that learned for-heads get, Me canoniz'd among the highest gods will set. The pleasant groves, the light-foot Nymphs, and Satyrs dance, Shall me above the vulgar sort of men advance, If Euterpe my pipes stop not, nor the sweet Muse Polymnia my Lesbian Harp to tune refuse. But if that thou among the Lyrick Poets place me, Not heaven it self can then with more c?tentment grace me. Ad Licinium. Lib. 2. Ode 10. The Argvment. Those that desire soone to aspire To happinesse of life, By th'golden meane, the same must gain, Which most is freed from strife. Thou shalt Licinius better live, if still Thy Bark thou doe not force into the Deep; Or, ore-much fearing lest rough windes should fill Thy sailes, too neer the crooked shore do creep. He that regards and loues the golden meane, Is not with smoak of his poore house blear-ey'd: And, well advis'd, he blends not with the traine Of mighty Princes that are most envy'd. Oft-times, the windes do toss the Cedars tall: And stately Towers up-reard into the ayre, With greater danger to the earth do fall: And thunder-bolts the highest hils doe teare. In all distress, a well instructed minde Hope intertaines: And feares, when fortune smiles, That suddenly shee'll turne and prove unkinde. Ioue black fac't winters brings and them exiles. If now wisht-for success do thee refuse, Think not that still it will continue so: Sometime Apollo's Harp the drooping Muse Strikes up, Nor bends he still his angry bowe. If clowds of hard mishap ore-cast thy day, With beames of thy great courage them expell: And when thy Ship doth dance upon the Sea, Led down the sailes with too proud windes that swell. Ad Lydiam. Lib. 1. Ode 13. The Argvment. It much him mooves, that Lydia loues His Rivall: And their life He doth commend, whose loue to th'end Continueth without strife. When Lydia thou of Telephus dost tell, His rosie neck and plyant armes dost praise, My liver then (alas!) begins to swell, Enrag'd with wrath which nothing can appease. My colour, changing oft, doth plainely shew How my perplexed minde is plung'd in woe: And tears, by stealth from watry eyes that flowe, Can nothing quench loves fire that still doth growe. I vexed am, whether iarre-breeding wine Caus'd roaring Boyes to wrong thy shoulders faire; Or the Lust-raging Lad, those lips of thine The wanton marke caus'd of his tooth to beare. Beleeve me, he will never constant prove, That rudely wrongs sweet kisses in such sort; Those kisses, which the Goddess faire of loue Graceth with the fift part of her best sport. Thrice happy, and more happy, are they sure, Whose mutuall love so banisheth all strife, That pure and constant it doth still endure Till Fates cut off their well-spun thread of life. Ad Grosphum. Lib. 2. Ode 16. The Argvment. No outward thing thee well can bring Vnto a quiet minde. Within it is, that brings this bliss: There helpe we best may finde. The Marchant toyl'd in the Egëan Sea, When Phœbe's face is vail'd with a dark cloud, And the known stars from sight are fled away, For ease unto the gods doth cry aloud. For Ease, the Thracians (terrible in warre) For Ease, the Medes (with comely quivers bold) O Grosphus, to the gods still suters are, Bought with no gems, with purple, or with gold. No treasure, neither Sergeant can arrest The wretched hurly-burlies of the minde, And cares with rest-less wings that beat the breast, And in faire-fretted roofes still harbour finde. He lives well with a little, that doth keep His late Sires table furnisht with meane fare; That is not robd of rest, nor scar'd from sleep With hide-bound Avarice, or heart-scorching Care. Why doe we, short-liv'd things, on tentars set Our greedy thoughts with vaine desire of pelf? In climats furthest off, What would we get? Who, from his Countrey exil'd, flees from himselfe? Care, vice-borne, climbs into the brass-stemd ships: In warlike troupes her selfe she slily shrowds: Swifter then Stags, swifter then windes she skips, That do disperse, and drive away the clowds. Be Ioviall while time serves (Time will not stay.) Hate curiously t'enquire what will betide: Sowr discontentments with sweet mirth allay. Entirely good, nothing doth still abide. Vntimely death did stout Achilles slay: Old age Tithonus did Epitomize: And my birth-star perhaps grants me a day To date my life; which thine to thee denies. Faire flocks of sheep, fat heards of cattell low About thee, and thy lustfull Mare with pride Neighs out, now for the Chariot fit: and thou Wearst purple, twice in Tyrian liquors dy'd. The Dest'nie, ne'r deceiv'd, on me bestowes A little ground, and veine of Poësie Which from the pleasant Greekish fountains flowes, And th'un-taught Vulgar wils me to defie. In ambitiosum quend? &amp; avar?. Li. 2. Od. 18. The Argvment. That hee's content with his small rent; When richer still doe crave, And for more look by hook or crook Though one foot in the grave. No Ivory feeling, nor roofe adorned With light-out-streaming gold, in my house shineth: No beames from Hymet press pillars formed Where the sky-touching hill Affrick confineth. No wealth by ill meanes doe I win, Nor for mee clyents purple spin. But of trust and wit some store have I: To me but poor, come men rais'd high by fortune: More of the Gods themselves ne'r crave I, Nor greater things of my great friend importune: I wish not for more land or rent. Sabine alone yeelds me content. One day another day expelleth, New-moons soon die: Thou marble-trimmers hyrest Ready to goe where Pluto dwelleth; And, building, vainely to long life aspirest. From Neptune thou the shore dost steale away, Incroaching on the angry Sea. What should I tell, how 'gainst all order Thy neighbours land-marks alwaies thou removest, And from thy tenants that upon thee border, Ground pilfers: Thou from house and home out-shovest Both man and wife, that wailing beare Their houshold gods and children deare. Yet hast thou (rich Lord) no assurance So great of any house where thou remained, As that thou shalt be kept in durance Of all-devouring hell, and there restrained. What wilt thou? None the grave can shun: It takes the King, and the Kings sonne. Nor was hells Catch-pole with gold bribed Wily Prometheus backward to bring againe: He boasting Tantalus derided, And his proud of-spring though they cry'd out amaine. He easeth men cast downe with woe, Whether they call on him or no. Ad Posthumum. Lib. 2. Ode. 14. The Argvment. None can deny, we all must die. And riches to no end Som keep with fears, which their glad heirs Soon riotously will spend. O Posthume, Posthume, years doe passe away Like glyding streames. Nor pietie can stay The wrinkled brow, nor olde age hasting fast, Nor death, that all attacheth at the last. Not if my friend, each day in all thy yeares, Stern Pluto thou should with three-hundred Steers Seek to appease. Three-headed Gerion, And Tytius, ore the Stygian streame are gone: Which all must doe that heer do draw their breath; Both Kings, and silly Labourers of the earth. In vaine from bloody broyles we take our ease, And from th'encounters of the Adrian Seas: In vaine in Autumne seeke we to avoid The Southern blasts, whereby we are annoyd. We needs must see Cocytus heavie flood, And Danaus cruell daughters staind with blood, And Sisyphus that rowles against the hill The stone that tumbles back upon him still. Thy house, thy land, and wife to thee most deare, Thou needs must leave: Nor to the mournfull beere Will any of these trees that thou dost dress, Attend on thee, but the sad Cyparess. Thy heire, more worthy, riotously will waste Thy Cecube wines with many locks kept fast; And die the pavement with high-spirited wine, Better then Prelates drink of when they dine. Ad Pirrham. Lib. 1. Ode 5. The Argvment. He saith, their state is curst by Fate That Pirrha's baits inthrall: From this gulf freed, vowd gifts with speed That he hung oth'Church-wall. What pretty youth, weltring in roses With liquid odors overspred, O Pirrha thee in's armes incloses, When thou loves Lecture hast him read. Ith' inner bower? Neglecting curious dresses, For whom plaitst thou the gold-wire of thy tresses? How oft will he that at his pleasure Enioyes thee now (alas) complaine, That he is robd of that sweet treasure By angry gods, and vowes made vaine? How will he curse the Seas so soon that wrangle, Whom such sly baits could not before intangle? For he poor soule, deceiv'd, beleev'd Thou wouldst be true to him alone, And lovely: But his heart, now griev'd, Thy false inconstancy doth mone. His tents he in destructions black field pitches, Whom thou untride, with thy fair face bewitches. The Temples wall, that's consecrated, To every eye the Table showes Where my sad ship-wrack is related: And how ith' midst of all my woes, I hung to th'Sea god, after strange beseeches, My doublet wringing wet, and cod-piec't breeches. Ad Martium Censorin?. Lib. 4. Ode. 8. The Argvment. That to his friends he nothing sends But Verses: and this gift Doth make mens name resound with fame, And them to heaven up-lift. Rich plate and Iewels, that do lively showe The work-mans skill, I frankly would bestowe Vpon my friends, O Censorine. I would Give them faire tables garnished with gold, In-layd with Ivory, on strong trestles set, Th'high-priz'd rewards of valiant Greeks. Nor yet Shouldst thou the worst have, if I did abound With those things that Parrhasius have renown'd, Or Scophas, to these present times; The one Cunning in colours, th'other in hard stone, To make a man, or god: But, this I want: And of such ornaments thou hast no scant. Thou verses lov'st: I verses can give well, And of this gift the worthy praises tell. No marble Statues with high titles wrought, By which both breath, and life againe is brought To noble Captaines after they are dead; Nor Hanniball, with break-neck speed that fled (When all his threats upon himselfe return'd) Nor faith-less Carthage into cinders burn'd, Doe more his noble acts commit to Fame (Affrick subdu'd, that gaind a glorious name) Then the Calabrian Muses. If they faile To doe good deeds, it nought will thee availe. Had not the Boyes name long since from us fled, Whom Mars (when Ilia lost her maiden-head) Begot, if envious silence could from us Conceale the acts of worthy Romulus? From Stygian rivers, Æacus, set free By powr-full skill of divine Poësie, Is canoniz'd for ever to remaine Amongst th'Heroës in th'Elysian Plaine. Praise-worthy men the Muse forbids to die: The Muse men blesseth with eternitie. Great-hearted Hercules is so Ioues guest, And frolicks with him at his wished feast. The two Tindarian twins, so, safely keep The Ships, though tost in billowes of the Deep. So Mars (his temples circled with vine-bowes) Grants mens requests, and binds them to their vowes. Ad Lydiam. Lib. 3. Ode 9. The Argvment. Though late some iarre did them debar From kindness us'd before: Yet ioyntly now, they make a vow Of love for ever-more. Hor. While lately Lydia thou didst love me, When thy white neck I in mine arms (then blest) did fold, And thou no Gallant grac't above me, I then the Persian King more happy was inrould. Lyd. While Horace thine affections flame Was firme, and Lydia thou then Chloë 'steemd not less, Thy Lydia then, of no meane fame, I liv'd more honor'd then the Roman Emperess. Hor. Now Thracian Chlo' has my heart sure, That sweetly bears a part in prick-song, and can play: For whom I would deaths paine indure, If so the Dest'nies would put off her dying day. Lyd. Kinde Caläis, and me Love so Heats with mutuall fire, dispersing clouds of strife, That twice I death would undergo If for my Boy I could renew his lease of life. Hor. What if old Love to us wing make, And us now severd, in still lasting links do binde? If gold-haird Chloë I forsake, And Lydia my door ne'r shut against her finde? Lyd. Though he be fairer then a starre, Thou lighter then the cork that still doth floting lie, And angrier then enrag'd Seas farre; I love with thee to live, with thee I wish to die. Eadem aliter. The Argvment. In one state they can never stay, Whom Cupids toyes intangle: What now they chuse, they straight refuse Still fickle and new-fangle. Hor. When I enioy'd thee without check, And none more welcome did embrace The snowie treasure of thy neck, The Persian Monarke gave me place. Lyd. While thou lov'd not another more, Nor Chloë bare away the bell From Lydia renownd before, I Roman Ilia did excell. Hor. Chloë, my Mistris, is of Thrace, Whose warbling voyce by skill is led: For whom I would see Death's pale face, If she might live when I am dead. Lyd. Now Calais is my hearts delight. He answers me with love againe: For whom I twice with Death would fight, If he my halfe-selfe might remaine. Hor. What if sweet Venus doe revive, And true-loues-knot between us tie? If from my thoughts faire Chlo' I drive, If my doore ope when Lydia's nie? Lyd. Though he then stars be fairer farre, Thou angrier then the raging Seas When 'gainst the sturdy rocks they warre: With thee I'll live and end my dayes. Eadem paulo fusius. The Argvment. The storme now spent of discontent (If Lovers words be true) The bonds againe (still to remaine) Of loue we will renew. When I had scal'd, and did possesse The happy Fortress of thy love, And all assaylants comfortless Tir'd with long siege did thence remove; In Fortunes lap, who then, but I, By Venus luld-asleep did lie? Lyd. While thou this lovely fort kept well, And thy affections did not range, Nor 'gainst thee oft made vowes rebell, Nor Lydia did for Chloë change, No Princesse was more blest in earth, I then did draw most happy breath. Hor. Now Thracian Chloë hath the raines Of my affection in her hands, Skilfull in Musicks sweetest straines, And well to play she understands: For whom I would breathe out my last, If she might live when my life's past. Lyd. Well featur'd Calaïs is my ioy: He hath possession of my heart: He sets me free from all annoy: He love for loue doth still impart: For him I twice would death endure, If him long life it might procure. Hor. What are our iarres if Venus smile, And (cunning) with her grace-full traine, Our mindes distracted reconcile, And binde us in a stedfast chaine? If from my house faire Chlo' I reave, That it my Lydia may receiue? Lyd. Though he in beauty farre excell The stars, the fairest youth alive: And thou unconstant be, and fell, As waves against the windes that strive; With thee I would in life remaine, With thee I death would intertaine. Ad Melpomenen. Lib. 4. Ode 3. The Argvment. Whose birth the Muse doth not refuse To grace with friendly eye, Shall glory gaine, by the sweet veine Of divine Poësie. Whose birth Melpomeney Thou smiling look'st upon, No toyle in Isthmos him can make A famous Champion. No stately Steeds shall draw, Contending for the prize, His conquering Charet going on With ioyfull shouts and cryes. Nor good successe in warre, To th'Capitoll him brings Adornd with bayes, because the threats He batterd of proud Kings. But waters, that their course By fertill Tiber take, And woods with leaves thick-clad shall him Renownd by verses make. The Gallants of great Rome Amongst the crue recite me Of lovely Poëts: Envie now, With venim split, less bites me. O Muse, that guid'st the strings Of the sweet warbling Lute: O thou that if thou wilt canst give Swans notes to fishes mute; It's thy free gift, that me Her Poët Rome doth call: It's by thee that I breath, and please, If ought I please at all. Laudes rei rusticæ. Epod. 2. The Argvment. He many wayes the life doth praise, That menith' countrey finde: Amongst the rest, he likes that best For quietnes of minde. Hee's blest, from City turmoyls free (As whilome men were wont to be) His Sire-less land with his owne steers That plowes, and Vsurers ne'r feares. Alarums fierce him doe not raise, Nor trembles he at th'angry Seas: He the proud gates of great men flees. To Lawyers he creeps not with fees; But to the youthfull Vine doth wed The Poplar with his stately head, Or else dead branches off doth cut, And better in their roome doth put. Or in the winding valley he, Sees where his heads of cattell be; Or hony layes up safe to keep In pots, or sheares his feeble sheep: Or when Autumnus head is crownd With apples ripe in each field found, How glad's he peares he graft to pull, Or grapes of pleasant liquorfull, With which he Priape thee rewards, Or Sylvan that the fields regards? Now under th'aged Oke he'll rest, Now on the grass, as he likes best. Meane while from hils the waters fling, And in the woods the birds doe sing, The bubbling fountains murmurings make, And him invite a nap to to take. But, when sharp winter cold doth blowe Ith' thundring ayre with sleet and snowe, With dogs he drives the eager Bore Into the toyles prepar'd before; Or stretches forth his nets on stakes, With which the greedy Thrush he takes, The farre-come Crane, or fear-full Hare (His pains sweet pay) he doth insnare. Thus busi'd, who doth not forget The cares that lazie Lovers fret? But if his modest wife part beare In guiding th'house and children dear (As Sabines and the sun-burnt wife Of sterne Apulia led their life) And sacred fire of dry wood burne Against her Good-man home returne: If the milch Yewes to Fold she bring, And milking them doe something sing, And draw forth wine, and spread the boord With th'unbought cates the Farms affoord, No Leverine shell-fish more likes me, Nor Bret, nor dainty Golden-eye, In Eastern Seas if any tost A storm doe drive upon our Coast. I love not more an Affrick hen, Nor the Ionian Attagen, Then Olives ripe, that gathered be From fattest branches of the tree; Or Rheubarb that doth love the field, Or Mallowes that good physick yeeld, Or Lamb slain at the Land-marks feast, Or Kid from the Wolves iawes releast. Thus feasting, how much doth't him good To see his full-fed flocks home scud? To see, with necks faint, drouping how The Oxen draw the turnd-up plow? And Hindes; the swarme rich men desire, Beaking themselves before the fire? The Vsurer Alphëus (this said) A countrey life then needs would lead: Ith' Ides his mony forth, cald-in; Ith' Calends it layes out agen. Ad Authorem. This Ode following, came unto my hands under the name of M?. Ben. Iohnson: which (for the happy imitation of Horace) I have also published. The Argvment. Till his Sire true doe claim his due, This Infant I doe cherish: Though without name, it were a shame It should in darknes perish. Remember, when blinde Fortune knits her brow, Thy minde be not deiected over-lowe: Nor let thy thoughts too insolently swell, Though all thy hopes doe prosper ne'r so well. For, drink thy teares, with sorrow still opprest, Or taste pure wine, secure and ever blest, In those remote, and pleasant shady fields Where stately Pine and Poplar shadow yeelds, Or circling streames that warble, passing by; All will not help, sweet friend: For, thou must die. The house, thou hast, thou once must leave behind thee, And those sweet babes thou often kissest kindly: And when th'hast gotten all the wealth thou can, Thy paines is taken for another man. Alas! what poor advantage doth it bring, To boast thy selfe descended of a King! When those, that haue no house to hide their heads, Finde in their grave as warm and easie beds. Ad Torquatuin. Li. 4. Od. 7. The Argvment. Goods got with care, we should not spare, But spend them merily: It then best fits, while time permits; Which soon us hence will carry. The snowes are fled, the fields are clad with grasse, And leaves trees prank: Times change, and floods decreasing pass Not their know'n bank. The Graces, with the Nymphs nak't on the strand, The Measures sweetly dance, hand ioynd in hand. The Yeare and Night, that cancels the fair day, Shewes we must die: Cold by the Spring, the Spring is driven away By Summer nie: Summer to Autumne yeelds, that pours forth graine: Then barren Winter takes his roome againe. Yet the swift Moones their losses soon repaire: But, when we shall Come where good Anchus and Æneas are, To dust we fall. How know'st thou, whether the great gods will give Thee one day longer in the world to live? Thy friendly gifts the clutches scape alone Of thy glad heire. When thou iust Minos doome hast undergone (Layd on the beere) Nor thy high birth (Torquatus) nor thy wit, Nor piety thee thence will ever quit. Diana, Patroness of chastitie, Could not recall Hyppolitus, that in dark vaults did lie Of Pluto's hall: Nor Theseus the infernall chains could rend, That captive held Pyrithous, his friend. Ad Chloen. Lib. 1. Ode 23. The Argvment. That there's no cause, from Cupids lawes Why Chloë free should sit; For Hymens rites, and sweet delights, Since shee's already fit. Thou shunn'st me, Chloë; like the Fawn Missing her mother in the Lawn, That trips to th'hills, in feare Of every blast and breare. For, whether windes amongst leaves rustle, Or Lizards in the brambles bustle, Shee trembles at the hart, And quakes in every part. I come not Tiger-like to ill thee, Or as a Lion fierce to kill thee: Still follow not thy mother, Now fitter for another. Ad Aristium Fuscum. Lib. 1. Ode. 22. The Argvment. If thou, within, doe feele no sinne, That tortureth thy minde, Thou maist from thence a sure defence Against all dangers finde. An upright man, and honest liver (O Fuscus) needs nor bowe, nor speares Of the black Moore, nor yet the quiver He full of poysoned arrowes weares; Whether through Circes scalding Sands, Or craggy Caucasus, he goe, Or places where through many Lands Hydaspes streams doe gently flowe. For, in the Sabine wood while I Of Lalage sung without dread, And rom'd with care-less liberty, A Wolf from me unarmed fled; An hideous beast: whose like ith' groves Of warlike Daunia doth not dwell; Nor in Morisco's Desarts roves The dry-nurse of the Lions fell. Ith' dull fields set me, where no tree Releeved is with gentle aire; That ne'r from clouds, and mists is free, But still doth angry tempests beare. Vnder the glorious chaire me set, Whence Phœbus mounting up on high, The earth with burning rayes doth beat, And dwellings unto men deny; I Lalagen will love the whiles, That sweetly speakes, and sweetly smiles. Lib. 1. Ode 26. Ad Lamiam. The Argvment. He doth declare, that those, which are Vnto the Muses kinde, Doe ease their griefe, and finde relief From Passions of the minde. I, of the Muses lov'd, sad Care and Feare Will to the stubborn windes commit to beare Into the Cretian Seas, secure alone Oftidings from the Northren coast that's blown Of some King there, that's awfull for his might; Or what so Tyridates doth affright. O gentle Muse, that lov'st the fountaines cleare, Fair fresh flowers gather, springing here and there: And garlands for my dearest Lamia make: My praise without thee no effect can take. Thee and thy Sisters it becometh well With Lesbian Harp, and Songs, his praise to tell. Lib. 3. Ode 30. The Argvment. That more his name is rais'd by Fame, For Lyrick Poësie, Than Kings that raise Pyramides, For lasting memory. The English (as the first) answereth the Latin in lines &amp; syllables. A work I ended have, which brass will far out-weare, And 's higher th? the stately piles that Kings up-rear; Which neither rating Rain, nor boystrous Northren blast, Nor progress of years numberless, e'r down shall cast: On wich ne'r wingd-foot Time shall any vantage have. I wholly shall not die. My better part, the grave Shall not inclose. My fame, with Ages following, shall Growe alwayes green, whiles to the sacred Capitoll The Priest with silent Vestall virgins up shall goe. It will be told, whereraging Ausidus doth flowe, And poor in water where old Daunus forth doth showe His sun-burnt face to people rude, that I (from lowe Estate advanc't) was he that first of all did suit Æolian Songs and Sonnets to a Roman Lute: Be proud, Melpomene, of this deserved praise, And binde my temples willingly with Delphian Bayes. FINIS. EPIGRAMMES, EPITAPHES, ANAGRAMMES, And other Poems of diuers subiects; in Latine and English. A SPEECH, MADE TO the Kings Maiestie comming in his Progress to Rippon, the 15. of Aprill, 1617. In the Person of Mercvrie. High Iove, with all the gods together met, To see (great King) thy comming to this Town, The casements large of heaven have open set, And from their star-pav'd floors have sent me down, Thee in their name to welcome to this place; Which both thy Bountie, and thy Presence grace. Young Phœbus, from his bright and radiant haire, Such ioyfull light abroad here neuer shed Since good King Adlestone of yore did reare These stately piles with gold embelished; Which after-times (miss-led) did rent asunder, And at the last (alas!) were fir'd with thunder. What Iliads of grief! what dole-full teen! What Out-cries then were heard of young and old! What Lamentation in the streets was seen, As in this fear-full case they did behold These holy things doom'd to the fire a prey? But at a trice the Heaven his rage did stay. For, in the Dest'nies rowles, that open were, (Thrice sacred King of men) they found, that thou These wofull ruines should againe up-reare, And Royall gifts for aye on it bestowe: Nor can we think how better they deserve That build, then they from down-fals that prezerve. No marvaile then, if every field and tree, The windowes and the tops of houses too, With people of all sorts replenisht be, And where thou go'st if Nymphs sweet flowers do strowe. From every place (good King) see how they run. To feast their eyes; and cry, Hee's com, Hee's com. Nor were the sluces of thy Bounty so Set open to the Churches good alone: But, it aboundantly did also flowe, And to the Town by grace-full streams was show'n, When (made a body Politique) they did rise To Place, with Hutton's, York's, and Mallory's. And though Pactolus, with his golden sands, Be farre remote from places where they dwell: Yet come they not (good King) with empty hands: For, other gifts they bring which gold excell; Trve Loyall Hearts: which thou wilt not forsake. Of Harvest small, the gods small hand-fulstake. The gods aboue, thy loving Subiects here, Thy sacred Person in protection take: And so Adieu, to gods and men most deer; Whom, in such Progresses, oft happy make: And, by Heroïck deeds beseeming thee, Make way to th'high tow'rs of Eternity. Ad Potentissim? &amp; Clementiss. Regem Iacobvm, Ecclesiæ Collegiatæ Ripponensis Restaurator? benigniss. auspicatissimo Maiestatis suæ progressu Ripponam advenientem, 15. Aprilis 1617. These verses following, were then delivered to his Maiesty, and by him most graciously accepted. Ad Regem Angl. If of the gods good Kings high Stewards be, To ease them of the care of things belowe; Then live secure, O heavenly Powrs: for we So good a Steward ne'r before did knowe. Ecclesiæ Ripponen: Prosop. Angl. King Adleston me built, Danes down did pull: But Odo'nd Thurston, made me beautifull: And (mov'd with zeale) King Iames doth now restore What sacrilegious hands had rob'd before. Altera eiusdem Prosop. Angl. The Dane me sackt, poor wretch the Scot, o're-bold In victory, unworthily me sold: But, to both Realmes a Royall stem, by Fate, His peoples faults (Beholde!) doth expiate. These following, were added since. Alia eiusdem Prosop. Angl. Queen Elsabeth oft my complaints did heare: But she no help (by death prevented) gave me. These ruines crav'd a great King them t'up-reare: This praise thou hast alone, good King, to save me. De Rumore falso, de Regis morte subitò sparso. Angl. When Fame (great King) did through this Citie flie, And told how Thou too soon a death didst die; All places paid to thee the wofull Rent Of Tears, which from their grief-swoln eyes they sent. The Father of our Countrey's dead, they cry, And with him all our ioyes doe buried lie. Who e'r the raines of kingdoms so did guide? Whose Iustice ioynd with Mercy so is tride? Who mildness so with Maiesty hath sorted? Or with his kingly hand the wrongd supported? None e'r (alas!) with such high praise did live. No Age hath given one like him: none shall give. So, false Report hath true Report brought forth, Which still shall witness to the world thy worth. De Eodem. Angl. Wherefore did Fame this wofull Newes forth spread, That thou (our Soveraigne) by curst hands wast dead? Sure to this end; that thou alive might see, When thou art gone, what fame will follow thee. Ad Carolvm, Augustissimum Walliæ Principem. Of the Prince his Imprese. Ic Dien. I serve. Angl. I serve, the Royall Scepter born to sway. Hee'll ne'r rule well, that well did not obey. Ad Pictorem. Angl. If thou our Prince set forth in colours fit, Let Maiestie (inthron'd) in's Countenance sit. On's lips let Pitho, on's brows let Pallas rest. Let Mildnes be his rosie cheeks chief Guest. Let ioyfull Victorie o'r his locks hover. Let his eye-lids the Graces grace discover. But, if thy Skill this reach not, say; Alas, How farre doth Natvre, Art (her Page) surpass! To the most Beautifull and Uertuous Princess, the Lady Elisabeth. Epigr. de eodem Anagrammate. Angl. The Virgins birth (O Royall Maid) Gods Son, For ever bless thee, as he hath begun. Ad eandem sereniss. Heroïnam. Angl. Thou to the Graces number addest one: But, all their vertues are in thee alone. Ad Illustrissimum Dominum, Georgivm Villiers, Marchionem Buckinghamiæ Amplissimum. Angl. Nor generous 'haviour, nor thy browes sweet Graces, Nor Mildnes which thy Genivs still imbraces: Nor Fame, which thou didst finde in forain Lands, And with her wings here fairely on thee fannes: Nor vertues rare, with Fortunes gifts attended, Nor bountie to the Muses so commended, To thee mens eyes and hearts drawes, and ith' scrowle Of true Nobilitie doth thee inrowle: But, what it is, soon wouldst thou understand? All these, in Thee alone, ioyn'd hand in hand. To the same right Honourable, George, Marquess of Buckingham, upon the Accession of his Office of the Admiralty. Ex Latino. Sing Io. Buckingham doth Seas controwle: He Horses rules, and Waves that proudly rowle. So, 'mongst the gods, Neptune, that bravely glides Through Crystall streames, courageous Horses guides. Then, let none think this double Powr unfit; Sith even the gods, themselves, have practiz'd it. [Let's Io's sing, till th'Eccho's ring] Idem aliter. Let's Io's sing, till th'Eccho's ring; For, Buckingham oth'Seas Is Gen'rall: He doth Horses free, And struggling Waves appease. So, 'mongst gods high in Maiestie, He, that with triple Mace The Sea with waves rules when it raves, Guides Horses swift in chase. Let none amiss then think it is, That double powr is given To one to beare; since to us here Th'example comes from Heaven. [Iö. A thousand Mermaids dance oth' Maine] Idem paulò fusius. Iö. A thousand Mermaids dance oth' Maine; Their Vice-Roy Buckingham to entertaine. So, he, that the proud-neighing Horse commands, Is Generall in Thetis liquid lawnds. Likewise, 'mongst gods that are of highest place, Saphir-hewd Neptune, with his aw-full Mace, The mutinous waves, that subiècts to his lawes, Makes sturdy steeds take bits in foaming iawes. Then, let no Cynick with his furrowed brow Grudge at this double power that's given him now; Since, from the gods that raigne in greatest state, We have this pattern given to imitate. To the Right honourable, Edmvnd, Lord Sheffield, after his Recovery from a dangerous sickness. When sickness late Heroïck Sheffield prest, Pallas was sick, and Mavors wisht to die: Pallas, whom still he harbourd in his brest; And Mars, who alwayes rais'd his thoughts on high. And if that death had taken him away, Mavors, and Pallas, both, had dy'd that day. Which Atropos, who came with murthering knife, Perceiving, cast the same out of her hand; And did refuse to cut his line of life Whose worthy praise is spread by Sea and Land; And said; Nay live: yea, and forever live. So ioy to men, and life to gods I give. [The Sermon Bub (whatsoe'r the Preachers doe)] In Bubbum. The Sermon Bub (whatsoe'r the Preachers doe) Into three parts divides; and then sleeps two. [A double Gelding Gervase did provide] In Gervasium. A double Gelding Gervase did provide, That he and's wife to see their friends might ride. And he a double Gelding prov'd indeed: For suddenly hee fell so to his speed, That both alight, with blowes and threats among: He leads him; and his wife drives him along. To the Right Honourable, Sir Francis Bacone, Knight, Lord High Chancelor of England. Thy Vertuous Name, and Office, ioyne with Fate, To make thee the bright Beacon of the State. Epithaphium Radulphi Simson, Ecclesiæ Collegiatæ Rippon. Choristæ. Angl. His Parents hope, the quires shrill Nightingall, With whose sweet voyce these sacred wals oft rung, Summond ro th'Saints, and answering at first call, His Nvnc Dimtlis to the world hath sung; And, crownd'mongst Virgins, with eternall Bayes, Te Devm sings, with Aleluïah's. To Master Aldebrough Esquire. Not weary to doe well, Thov dost persever; And a Glad Harbor to thy friends art Ever. [Sloth for a man unfitting is.] Angl. Sloth for a man unfitting is. High labour up doth rise. How many hath that spoyld; and this Aduanc't above the skies! To the Right Worshipfull, Sir Edward Mosley, Knight, Attorney of his Maiesties Court of the Dutchie of Lancaster. This Nothing take of him, that owes to Thee All things; and Nothing, if it greater bee. Ianus is come; and now begins to call For gifts, due at his first dayes Festivall: But, gifts to him I none can finde to bring: What? Are the sluces of the Thespian spring So shut up? Are my wits so in the wane, That the old Porter of the year, againe Returning, should me emptie handed see? I rather that, which no where found may be, In wayes before unknown will seek: and, Lo, From place to place by wandring to and fro, My Muse hath Nothing found. This Gift take well. Nothing doth pearle, Nothing doth gold, excell. This therefore with a friendly eye beholde: A new thing's heere; which none before have tolde. The Latin and Greek Poëts did rehearse All other things in their yet-living Verse: Nothing the Greeks and Latins left unsaid. Where-soe'r faire Ceres in the fields doth spread Her Plentie-bringing hands from Heaven's towrs, Or olde Oceanus (from his watry bowrs) The broad ball of the Earth encloseth round, Nothing's beginning or end is not found. Nothing's immortall: Nothing, on all sides, Still in the height of happiness abides. But, if from hence we prove the divine praise, Shall we not Altars then unto it raise? Nothing's more pleasant than the cheerfull light. Nothing with beauty more allures the sight, Then a well watred garden in the Spring. Nothing, than meadowes, is more flourishing. Nothing is milder then the Southern winde. In hurly-burlies, Nothing rest doth finde. Nothing is iust in Peace. Nothing holdes faith In Courtiers. And (as Tibullus saith) He happy is, that Nothing hath. For, he Feares not the traps of wily Treacherie. He feares not scar-fires that great-Towns lay waste: Nor he, by Theeves, or Robbers, is agast: Nor he, in carefull Sutes, his wit doth waste. And Zeno's Wiseman, that doth so subiect All things to Fate, Nothing doth not neglect: H' admireth Nothing: Nothing he desires: And the Socratian but to this aspires, Nothing to knowe; which now's sought busily: And boyes ith' schoole learne Nothing willingly, Because to Wealth and Honour it doth bring. Knowe Nothing, and thou then shalt know the thing Which with a No-Say, eye-like, dy'd in graine, Is in the top of learnd Pythagoras Beane. Mercurialists, the bowels of the earth That rent, and with fire-belching bellows breath Smelt metalls, and their Patrimonies mingle With Sulphure, Mercurie, and smoaky Ingle, Instant upon their secret work in holes, Forc't in their Fornaces with hell-black coales, At last with costly loss searching each creek Finde Nothing; and yet, Nothing found, still seek. No Pearch can measure this in th'Artists hand: Nor he, the number of the Lybian sand That knowes, can number it. Nothing, alone, Is to Minerva and Apollo 'unknowne. Nothing, it selfe above the Stars up-reares: Nothing is higher then the glorious Spheares. And though all ornaments of Wit You have (Searching things hid in Natures secret Cave) And gracefull speech (which when you doo advance, He was Commissioner from his Maiesty touching the Forrest of Knarsbrough. Might make whole Forrests after you to dance The Measures) and grave Wisdome (which doth bring You to imployment, from our gracious King, In matters of great Consequence) yet you (Oh! give me leave to speak the thing that's true, And all that know you, needs must to me grant) Doe seem of Nothing to be ignorant. Yet Nothing than the glorious Sun-beame's lighter: And Nothing then the glowing fire is brighter: Nothing doth fit each Fancie. Adde this too, Nothing's more subtle than the clouted-shoo. Touch Nothing: and thou then wilt surely say, Without a body Nothing touch we may: Nothing behold: and thou wilt say, that wee Can Nothing without help of Colour see. Without a Voyce, it speaks, and heares; and flyes Without Wings: Nothing walketh without Thies. Without a Place, Nothing to goe is able. Than Physick, Nothing is more profitable. Then, try not the Thessalian spels, or reeles, When the Idalian dart thy breast, pearc't, feeles; Nor Dictean weeds, from Ida's top tane, prove. Nothing doth cure the wounds of cruell Loue. And though thee Charon o'r his sad flood carry, Nothing will thee forbid there still to tarry. Nothing th'infernall King doth pacifie, And bends the distafs of hard Destinie. The Titans brood, in fields Phlegreian drownd, Than stroake of Thunder Nothing mightier found. Nothing without the worlds great wals doth stray. The gods feare Nothing. Why then dost thou stay, My Muse, so long? Than Vertue Nothing's better: And (to conclude) Nothing than Iove is greater. But, now these subtle Trifles time bids end; Lest, if in too much paper I commend My Verses, unto you of Nothing sent, They might more Weariness bring, than Content. To M?. Miles Moody, of an Epitaph which he wrote of the death of his vertuous and loving wife, Elisabeth, daughter to M?. William Fawcet, Alderman of Rippon. And doth the Torrent of thy long-pent Griefe At last breake through the flood-gates of thy woe; That in a streame of teares findes some reliefe, Which from thy heart o'r-charg'd with Sorrow flowe? Nor can I blame thee, that (so left alone) The loss thou of thy dearest doth bemone; Like the true Turtle, that his lovely mate (As she is busie feeding of her young) Beholds oth' sudden (O ungentle Fate!) With a wreath'd Serpent slily creeping stung; Whose poyson shed it selfe int' ev'ry part, And ceased not till it had seiz'd her hart. Her Minde devout, her Life was harmless led: To parents, children, and to thee most dear. With hope of Ioy, she (on her dying bed) Vndanted, intertain'd Death drawing neare. In Earth, she by these vertues was commended: These were the staires by which she Heaven ascended. Then serve a Supersedeas on thy Woe: She will be absent from thee but a while. Meane while, the houres, that lingring seem too slowe, Thou with her lively pictures maist beguile. The time's at hand, when (ioynd in Ioyes for ever) Nor Time, nor Death, shall powr have you to sever. An Epitaph upon the death of Elisabeth Brigges, Daughter to the discreet Matron and Widow, Bettrice Brigges. Come Virgins, come: Why doe you linger so, With streams of tears that fr? your swoln eys showr? Her Grave with Roses and with Lillies strowe, That of your Garland was the fairest Flowr. Lillies and Roses soon decay and perish, While bitter Worm-wood and sharp Nettles flourish. Your Garlands breake: henceforth no garlands beare: Their fading doth your fading state expresse. For Garlands, deadly Yeugh and Elder weare, And branches of the saddest Cyparesse. Lillies and Roses, &amp;c. Ye Holly-hocks, why hold you downe your heads? And Violets, why pine you so away? Because (alas!) that shee from you is fled, That drest you, and hath tane her leaue for aye? Lillies and Roses, &amp;c. O Hymen, why didst thou pale Death permit, Within thy Right, to set his hate-full feet; And take her, that for thy sweet Rites was fit; For Bridals, that gave her a Winding-sheet? Lilies and Roses, &amp;c. When Death arrested her, with his sad Mace, And clowdy Mists her Senses over-spread, Her native favour he could not disgrace; Which was compos'd of purest white and red. Lillies and roses, &amp;c. All, that thy sweet conditions did knowe, Desired, that their lives they so might spend: And all, that from this life did see thee goe, Desired that their lives they might so end. Lillies and Roses soone decay and perish, While bitter Worm-wood and sharp Nettles flourish. To Sir Iohn Mallory, Knight, after his Recovery from a great Sickness. Of late, when Sickness on thy limbs did seise, Which Physicks skill could nothing help or ease, And with an Habeas Corpus Death was prest, With Non Omittas, ready theet'arrest; Each corner of thy house was fild with Wo, And sense-distracting Grief ran to and fro. Which heard, the Cry oth'Poor about thy gates, So shak't the doors of th'Adamantine Fates, That by their Page th'a Supersedeas sent To Death, to shew th'had altered their intent. For, if we take him, one of them did say, How many will with hunger pine away! In Matildam. When Maud hath tane deep moultar of the Can, She tels long stories of her dead Good-man: How kinde he was to her at bed and boord; And that he never gave her angry word. Twixt every Cup she talks, no Healths forbears; Which her resolves, like Niobé, to Tears: Then sighes she, and drinks off another Cup (For, Sorrow's dry.) then suddenly gets-up (Nor can her Gossips cause her longer stay) And t'her dear husbands Grave she takes the way: And thither come (crossing her selfe) doth weep; Then wrings her hands, kneels down, and fals asleep. To the vertuous, and fairely spreading Buds of Beautie, Mistris Marie, Francis, and Ioane Metcalf, daughters of Sir Thomas Metcalf, Knight, he dedicates these Roses. Ex Ausonio. It 'Spring, the Day, by fair Aurora led, Breath'd cooly; yet the Sense with pleasure fed: Quick Aire before the Eastern Steeds did run, Advising to prevent the scorching Sun. Then lov'd I in a garden by a spring; Where to delight me fitted every thing. A candid Pearle upon each grass-pile hung: Nor sparingly Pearles on the hearbs were flung: On cawles of Cobweb-lawne, glaz'd spangles plaid; Which full of heavenly liquor down-ward swaid. I saw the Rose-beds, with trim dressings proud; Which till faire Day a deawie vaile did shrowd. Ith' thickets Gems were scattered here and there: Which hide themselves when Phœbus rayes appeare. Whether the Rose Auror', or she hath dy'd The Rose with maidens-blush, t's not yet try'd. Their Deaw, their Colour, and their Morn is one: And both from Venus have protection. Perhaps their savour's one: Ith' aire, That's spent. This, neerer us, hath a farre sweeter sent. One Goddess guides the Star, and the Flowre, too: And, clad in Scarlet liveries, both goe. Nor suddenly the branches of the Rose In equall distances themselves disclose. This bravely weares a Periwig on her head, Her pretty Leaves are all with Purple spread. From her square Base she climbs, and up ascendeth; And (pointed with a Rubie-button) bendeth. Her plaited Robes this gathers in the top, Ready to open now her silken Shop. Her smiling Treasures then she sheweth plaine, And seeds of Saffron, which there safe remaine. Shee that but now her golden Leaves did brandish, Now pale (alas!) left of her Leaves doth languish. I mus'd, to see their Beauty did not stay; And, in their Cradle, that their Hairs grew gray. Even while I speake, see how their Glory Sheds, And how their Punick-pride the Ground o'r-spreads. Such Shapes, such Births, and divers Changes growne In one day, are in one day overthrowne. We blame thee, Nature, that Flowrs soon decay: Thou onely shew'st them, then tak'st them away. The age of Roses but one day doth last: Which being gon, their youthfull time is past. Her, whom now born the Sun saw rising red, Setting, he fainting sees on her Death-bed: Yet her Short Life requited is, that she Lives ever in her faire Posteritie. Pull Roses, Virgins, while the time doth last: And think how soon your Rose-time will be past. To M?. William Mallory, and his deare brother Iohn, the generous and gracefull children of M?. William Mallory, Esquire. See here the Map of humane Miserie, The Labyrinth that you are entring to, Full of cross-waies of ambiguitie Like to Mæander running to and fro: Here had you need of Ariadneys clue; Which in all doubts will aide and succor you. By help of it, the Minotaur you'll slay (A Monster bred of Lust and lewd Desire). And, being rid of that perplexed way, To sweet repose of minde you'll thence retire. Those, that to kill this Monster doe not strive, Shall (peece-meal) be devour'd of him alive. And may not I, the Palinurus now That at the Helm in a calm River sit, Of your lancht Frigot, tell what th'heavens foreshowe? That happy Windes shall still attend on it; And that great Neptune, with his azure traine, Will steer it, till the happy Port it gaine. Ausonius, ex græco, de ambiguitate eligendæ vitæ. Edyl. 15. begining thus Quod vitæ sectaboriter, &amp;c. What kinde of life may I desire as best, If Courts of Iustice freed from Brawls ne'r rest? If break-sleep Thoughts in private houses wun, If home-Cares after weary Pilgrims run, If to new losses Marchants be inur'd, If Husbandmen, Want (not to be indur'd) Forbids to loyter: if Toyle them o'r-throwes? If Seas, by Ship-wrack, prove our deadly foes, If Discontents attend a Bachlers life, But more in vaine to watch a wanton Wife? If Wars be bloody, if the sharking Arts Of Vsurers, suck blood from poor-mens harts? Each Age brings Cares: none like the present season. Young Babes, yet sucking, Iudgement want and Reason. Boyes it is hard within due bounds to keep: And hare-braind Youth fall into dangers deep. Fortune afflicteth men by cruell Wars, By crafty fetches and revengefull Iarres, By endless troubles linkt as in a Chaine, Still to be chang'd for worse that doe remaine. At last, Old-age, ill-wisht-for, on us growes, And us a spoyle to all Diseases throwes. We alwaies present things despise: tis seen, That som have wisht, they gods had never been. Iuturna cryeth-out, Why made he mee Immortall? Why from Death's stroak am I free? So unto Caucasus Prometheus ty'd Forbare not but on Saturns sonne out-cry'd. Nor ceased he even Iove himselfe by name (Because he was exempt from death) to blame. Behold the Vertues of the minde; and see Hippolytus o'r-thrown by Modestie: But, he that takes delight his life to staine With Wantonness, or baits of Pleasures vaine, Let him behold what punishment did fall On lustfull Tereus, or Sardanapal. The Carthage Wars bid treachery eschue. Saguntum, that she kept her faith, might rue. Live, and keep friendship still; this onely thing The Pithagoreans did to ruine bring. But, fearing it, Keep none: for this, alone, Th'Athenians did uncivill Timon stone. With inter-fering Cares, Mindes fraught dissent: That, which now pleaseth, straight will not content. Some Honours seek: which, had, they nought regard; Who, where they might command, stand at Reward. When this man is by favour raised high, Hee's thrust into the mouth of pale Envie. Still watch-full Cares goe with the Eloquent: But unkembd Clowns do want life's Ornament. Be thou a Patron, and defend th'accused; Of Clyents Thankfulness is seldome used. Be thou a Clyent, then thou must be sure, Thy Patrons words, full of commands, t'endure. To this man, Senators make sute and mone: But, straight disgrac't Grief him attends alone. Poor Old-age men despise. If Heirs thou want, Of cheating Claw-backs thou shalt have no scant. Be frugall, and a Niggard thou art nam'd: Be lavish, then thou shalt be more defam'd. If thou be forc't Adversitie to beare, Then all things else will goe against the haire. Then, with the best Greek Sentence, I agree; Tis good, Not to be born; or Soon to die. To M?. Iohn Cameage. Thou living, dost right well, to have Remembrance of thy death and grave. [When perils I by Land and Sea had past] When perils I by Land and Sea had past, Age Came, and Sommond me to death at last. Epitaph. Angl. This Citie, where to learn I first began, Me breeding gave, till (growing to a man) Strange fashions I and kingdoms longd to see; Not did I scape the Turkish tyrannie. From which delivered strangely (of thy Art, O Typhis, I shal skilfull was in part) Through raging Seas (guided by power divine) To th'trustier shore of Christians, me and mine I safely brought. Then, almost spent with toyle, I came againe to see my Countrey-soyle: Where to my former trade of life addrest, At last I here in quiet peace doe rest. Epitaphium D. Stephani Procter, Militis. Angl. Thy Ship, late tost from Coast to Coast, Thou steerd ith' Port to rest, From Circes charms and Scylla's harms; Where thou art ever blest. De Poculo. Ad G. N. Angl. With silver Lips this Cup to thee I send: Which with thy rosie Lips allow to blend. It will thee satisfie with Nectar sweet, Sweeter then Nectar, when thy Lips it greet. Ad M. T. Angl. Thou Pictures shewes to th'blind, to th'deafe thou sings, When to th'unlearn'd thou learned Poëms brings. Reverendo in Christo Patri &amp; D. Ioh. King, Episcopo Londinensi. Angl. Let men now cease of Orpheus Harp to tell, Which brought his wife Eurydice from Hell; Or how Amphion with his Lute did call Both Stones and Trees to build the Theban wall; Or how a Dolphin through the Seas did bring Arion, hyr'd with his harmonious string. Thy Kingly Trumpet, fild with heavenly breath, Excels them, raising men to Heaven from Earth. Epithaphium D. Gvil. Talentire, Rectoris de Goldsbrough. Angl. The Talents, which thy God unto thee lent, Thou hidst not, Talentire, nor lewdly spent; But, as a Servant true restor'd with gaine; And hast thy Faith's reward, in Heauen to raigne. Ad D. Gvil. Mallory, cum Virgilivm sibi auro pulchrè ornatum dederim. Angl. This gift (O generous childe) I give to thee, That greater would, if Fortune favord me: But, what gift greater may I to thee give, Then Virgil great, whose greatest praise doth live? Ad T. N. Angl. Thou saist, I owe to thee an Epigram. Take this: So, now out of thy debt I am. Epitaphium Reverendi viri, D. Mosis Fowler, primi Ecclesiæ Collegiatæ Ripponensis Decani. Angl. Heaven, Earth, and Men for one thing do contend: Each one doth Fowler chalenge to be his. Gods Messenger, from Heaven, this strife to end, Descend's: And thus his will performed is. His soule to Heaven, his body to the Grave, To Vs the tropheis of his wit he gave. Allusio in eiusdem nomen. Angl. Blinde Fortune hath not Fowler nam'd thee then. For, as he Birds doth take, so thou tak'st men. Not tir'd with toyl, both spread your Nets, and mend: Heart-charming Tunes from skilfull Mouthes both send. The Sun both busie sees, when he begins His race, and when in Neptune's bowr's he Innes. Yet this betwixt you both the difference makes: Thou gently sav'st, He kils those that he takes. Ad. D. Cradock, Ecclesiæ Cathedralis Dunelmensis Cancellarium, de Patris sui morte. Angl. Whenas the gods their Gifts on men bestowe, Their Store's not less. The gods thou follow'st so. But, they give not except long vows compell them: Thou, of thy Self, un-askt: So thou excels them. Therefore my Heart shall still the Altar be; Whence, Praise and Thankfulness I'll yeeld to thee. Ex Martial. Lib. 1. Epigr. If any worthie be to be inrowl'd Amongst true Friends, of which fore-times have told: If any in Greek Arts, or Latin be Well washt, and good with wise simplicitie: If any that loues Right, goes honest wayes, And so to God, that all may heare him, praies: If any staid with Magnanimitie; If this be not our Lindall, Let me die. Ad D. Christoph. Lindall, Ripponæ Præbendar. digniss. Angl. That with this Epigramme thy deeds agree, They well know, that did ever well know thee. To the worthily much-honor'd Knight, Sir Thomas Ferfax, of Denton. Whether thou warlike Barbarie bestride (That angry is with the controwling bit) Or in calm Peace (thy armour layd aside) Determining Causes on the Bench dost sit, Or dost retire to th'Muses thy delight, And reads, or makes as they to thee indite: Wheresoe'r thou art (renown'd Knight) thou dost beare The Image of that Monarch great of France, To whom Minerva brought both Shield and Speare; Whose Ensignes Victory did still advance; And on whose Grave, with bitter tears besprent, Mars mournes, and Prowess her hoare-hairs doth rent. Achilles Friend so like him did not goe, Whom Hector in his roome inrag'd did slay, As thou dost him in every point: For, so His eyes he mov'd, his hands did so display. And, more: The Heavens this Grace unto thee give, His Vertues cannot die, while Thou dost live. To the famous Martialist, Captaine William Ferfax. Nor from thy Name dost thou degenerate, Stern Mars his Minion, Darling of the Muses; Nor prises Honor at so lowe a rate, That it t'obtaine thou any toyle refuses. The way is steep, in which they must begin, That Honors Fort doe Scale, Surprise, and Win. With Trumpets sound, how sweetly dost thou ioyne The pleasing tunes of gentle Erato! And with what sacred theft dost thou purloine The hearts of men! What manly Vertues growe From thy young Years! which since as I desire I cannot praise, I onely will admire. Dialogus inter Vram &amp; Skell, duos amnes Ripponam ambientes, &amp; in parte oppidi orientali coeuntes, de morte celeberrimi viri, Ioh. Mallory, Equitis aurati. Angl. Vr. Tell me, good Skell, from mirth to mourning cheer What so hath chang'd thee, or what moves thy mind? Hath any troubled late thy Waters cleer? Or doth thy lovely Nymph now prove unkinde? Sk. Nor this, nor that: far greater Grief I knowe, Which on my wofull Heart doth heavie lie. Hast thou not heard the cause of common Woe; The Funerall of famous Mallory? Vr. Is Mallory dead? O cruell Fates decree! Could his great Worth obtaine then no Relief? O Irow lawes of still-stern Destiny, Ne'r satisfied with humane Woe and Grief! Sk. At his death, Nymphs in liquid Bowrs did weep; And, shrieking out, did rent their greenish hair: At his death, Wayling did all places keep: Both Heaven, and Earth their mourning weeds did wear. Vr. Was this the cause wisen sweet sleep clos'd mine eyes In my moss-matted roome, whiles Nymphs did sing, That Storm-wingd Boreas, and the thundring Skies, Me from my bed so suddenly did bring? Sk. Since both of Vs then Partners are in woe, And neither from disastrous Chance are free, Lets ioyne our streams, and both together goe: So, that, which two-fold was, one Grief will be. Vr. Content: but, thus; that both together we Doe run t'our Father Oceans larger coast: Hee'l us imbrace in's glassie Hall; and he, To ease our Grief, will play the gentle Hoast. Sk. May any thing more ioyfull me betide, Than him to see that rules ith' watry Field? Hee'l us receiue; and t'us, with weeping dry'd, He for fresh tears salt waters still will yeeld. In Rufum. Rufus, but late returning from the South, Knaps Southern; and now scornes his Countrey-mouth: He cringes with his Face, and looks aside; And sets his Countenance, as he were a Bride. He wears a nitty Lock: his Fingers skip, And dance Carantoes 'twixt his Waste and Lip; And is with Complement so fild to th'Brim, That when a Gentleman but said to him, What is't a clock; he first his hand did kiss; To say then, At your service, did not misse. And as the time he intertained thus, Before he would lay open or untruss The Budget of his Speech, with much adoo A formall leg he made, and sayd, Tis two. Ye Home-bred things, if you in's comp'nie fall, Be mannerly; or he will shame you all. Ad G. W. qui casu caput suum Cantabrigiæ fregit. Angl. Pallas had ne'r been born of high Ioves head, It's Head had not been broke and brought a-bed: Was not thy Head, then, broke in Pallas Towne, That Pallas in thy Head might take a roome? In Sacrificum quendam. A Priest, for Penance, one enioynd to take A iourney with three Pease, loose in his shoo: Which he, devoutly given, did not forsake, But fram'd himself his Penance straight to doo: Yet, that he might perform it with more ease, His wit did serve him, first to boyl the Pease. To the Right Worsh. the Lady Elsabeth Metcalf, the La. Catherin Fennick, and the La. Marie Bethell, Daughters of Sir Hen. Slingsbie, Knight. Iudge, Ladies, that are modest, faire, and wise (Since in their iudgements Men doe varie so, And in these cases Women best advise) Whether Lucretia did doo well, or no. [When with a knife chaste Lucrece stabd her side] Virgil: Lucretia. When with a knife chaste Lucrece stabd her side, And streams of blood thence gushed-forth, she cry'd, My spirit in Heaven, my blood shall witness heer, That I from staines of Chastity am cleer. How well will these, brought for me, plead and prove; This with the Ghosts, that with the Gods above! [My Bodie's staind: my Soule is pure and free.] Beza de Eadem. My Bodie's staind: my Soule is pure and free. Then, from this body, chaste dost thou not slee? [If the Adult'rer, Lucrece did thee please] In Eandem. If the Adult'rer, Lucrece did thee please, By Death deserv'd thou seeks unworthy praise: But rather if he forc't thee 'gainst thy will, For thy Foes fault, thou (mad) thy blood didst spill. In vaine then Lucrece thou seeks praise, at all: For, madly thou, or wickedly, didst fall. To M??. Dorathy Wythes, wife to M?. Charles Wythes, Esquire. Wise and Harty, both are good: Doth, gives them Life and Action. Without it, both are but a Bud, That growes to no Perfection. To M?. Marke Metcalf. Eutrapeley (as some thought) is not dead, Though long since she from us be gon and fled. Shee's with Marke Metcalf gon to York from hence: And with him there keeps dayly Residence. An Epitaph of I. H. Dyer. He lives with God, none can deny, That while he liv'd, to th'World did die. Ad Poetam doctissimum (utinam dicissimum) Ioh. Owen. Angl. Three Poëts one Mecœnas once did cherish: But now Three, One, for want of meanes, see perish. [Mecœnas earst three Poëts did mantaine] Aliter. Mecœnas earst three Poëts did mantaine: By Three, now, One scarce Bread and Cheese can gaine. [Three Poëts one Mecœnas whilom fed] Aliter. Three Poëts one Mecœnas whilom fed: Now Three let One goe supperless to bed. To the Honourable, Sir Thomas Wentworth, Knight Baronet. Be where thou wilt, Worth alwaies thee attends, In Publique and in Private causes know'n. Vertues thy Worth, thy Worth Vertues commends; Which in thy Words and Deeds are daily show'n. Where-e'r thou goes, so let thy Worth shine forth, That men may truely still say, There Went-worth. To Sir Charles Egerton, Knight. Mov'd (gentle Knight) by thy great Courtesie, And good Report I meet with every where, I adde these few words to the Memory Of Him, to whom in kinred thou wert neer; That Man of Worth, whom lately we did see England's State-Atlas, Cheshire's Treasurie. Ex Io. Syl. Anagr. Thomas Egerton. Honors mett Age. Honors mett Age; and, seeking where to rest, Agreed to lodge and harbor in thy Brest, Ad Ornatissimum Virum, D. Guidonem Palmes, Militem. Angl. If Ornaments thou of the Minde, Or Bodie in the Weigh-scales set, 'Mongst many Thousands thou'll not finde One, that from Palmes the Palm can get. Ad D. Franckland. Angl. Still let the Land be Frank to thee, (All rudeness set aside) Whose Frankness in all Courtesie So well is know'n and try'd. Ad Hen. Bethell, D. Gualteri Bethell, Militis filium, cum Iustinianum sibi mitterem. Angl. If Learning thou, or Riches would'st obtaine, Iustinian reade: By him thou both mayst gaine. Ad D. Io: Davies, Milit?, Iudicem Itinerari?. Angl. If Plato liv'd, and saw those Heaven-breath'd Lines Where thou the Essence of the Soule confines, Or merry Martiall read thy Epigrammes Where sportingly these looser times thou blames; Though both excell, yet (in their severall wayes) They both, ore-come, would yeeld to thee the Praise. Ad D. Thomam Best. Angl. With happy stars he sure is Blest, Wheresoe'r he goes that still is Best. To Mistris Katherin Dutton, Daughter of M. Dutton, the worthy Alderman of Chester, lately deceased. A Woman kinde, that is not True, Playes false, and makes her Husband me: If True she be, and nothing Kinde, Shee is a Corrasiue to his Minde, True kindness, and Kinde Truth in one, Make-up a happy Vnion. Epitaphium Robini. Round Robin's gone: And this Grave doth inclose The Pudding of his Doublet and his Hose. To M. Christopher Moyser. The Friendship, that betwixt us is begun For causes iust (which we our selves best knowe) Will for the same I trust on smoothly run, And with the time increase, and greater growe. Of One that (wearing an Hawthorne in his hat to save him from the thunder) was suspected, upon Examination found to be a Priest, and is now in Prison. Angl. A Priest, that he loves thunder might not feare, An Hawthorn garland on his head did weare: Which him from Cæsars thunder could not hide. Cæsar with Iove Dominion doth divide: [While fondly thou the Thunder shuns] Angl. While fondly thou the Thunder shuns Vpon the Thunder-bolt thou runs: For, surely God (whom all should praise) Not outward things, but inward please. To M?. Iohn Paget. Our Friendship strengthned by continuance, And the respect that to thy worth is fit, Claim in my Writings this rememberance, That each Page should Iohn Paget haue in it. In Tortum. Tortus, accus'd to lie, to feine, and flatter, Said, he but set a good Face on the matter. Then sure, he borrow'd it: for (tis well knowne) Tortus ne'r wore a good Face of his owne. De Seipso. Surety, what's that? I to my loss have try'd, Who for anothers Debt too Sure am Ty'd: If this I had Etymologiz'd before, I never had been shut within this doore. FINIS. THE PRAISE OF A COVNTRY LIFE. GENERIS SPLENDORE, Doctrina, &amp; Pietate viro præcellenti, D. Thomæ Wharton, Equiti aurato, D. Philippi Baronis de Wharton, Filio &amp; Hæredi. Angl. Accept these Lines, the Countrie's praise that tell (O thou the Court's and Country's dear Delight) Which, as I Mawnds made in my homely Cell, My Countrey Muse did late to me indite. So, let thy Philadelph (her Sexes praise) Enrich thee still with Treasures of her bed: So, let thy Philip, in thy Hall that playes, Thee Grandsire make by issue fairely spred. Virtutum tuarum cultor observantissimus, Ioh: Ashmorvs. Martial. Lib. 4. Epigram. 90. De Rusticatione. Asks thou, ith' Country how I spend the Day? Early, each morning, to the gods I pray. My Servants then, and Fields to see I goe, And every one appoint what worke to doe. This done, I read, and Vows to Phœbus make To ease me, and my drouping Muse t'awake. My Body then I rub and ore-anoynt, And easily stretch-out each Lim and Ioynt, Reioycing in my mind, secure and free From debt, and the black books of Vsurie. I dine, I drink, I sing, I wash, I play, I sup; then, from my Rest not long do stay: Yet, till my Lampe a little Oyle doe spend, Som time I nightly to the Muses lend. Virgil. Georg. lib. 2. Vitæ Rusticæ Laus. O happy (if their Happiness they knew) Are Husbandmen; to whom, in seasons due (Far from Bellona's Rage in bloody Fields) The thankfull Earth food from her Bosome yeelds. If their proud Gates from each Room belch not out Of Smell-feast Parasites a fleering Rout; Nor Pillars they desire, that bear on high Roofs fairly fretted with Imagery; Nor Clothes, where scattred Gold sportes interlaced; Nor Plate of Corinth curiously enchased; Nor their white Fleeces are with Venim foil'd; Nor self-pure Oyl with Slibber-sawces spoil'd: Yet quiet Rest, and harm-less Lives they have So rich of good things, that they need not crave; And spatious Grounds, where they doo walk at leasure; And Caves, and Springs, and Woods, and Groves, for pleasure. Their bellowing Oxen, and their bleating Sheep, In some cool Shade them summon to sweet Sleep: There Forrests, and there Dens of wilde Beasts are, And Youth enduring toil with little Fare; There holy Rites, and holy Fathers been: Astræa, leaving th'Earth, There laft was seen. But, first let the sweet Muses (whom above All other things I most esteem and love) Mee entertain their Priest, and to mee showe The Circuits that the Heav'ns and Stars doo go, The sundr' Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, Whence Earth-quakes come; what Powr the Sea so soon (His Bars broke down) makes proudly rage and swell, And brings it back, within its Banks to dwell: Why Winter-daies so fast doo run away, And why the lingering Nights so long doo stay. But, if dull Blood, congeal'd about my Hart, Forbids mee t'undergo this worthy Part Of Natures Worth; Then let the Country please-mee, And Rivers (running through the Vallies) ease-mee. Then let mee love the Woods and Floods unknowne. O that there were, O that there were but one That would mee set upon the pleasant Plain, By which swift Pirchius doth his Course maintain With posting Waters! or on Taget Hill, Which Spartan Virgins with mad Shriekings fill In Bacchus Feasts! or, under Hemus Bank, Would cover me ith' Shade of Branches rank! Hee's happy, that the Causes of things knowes That vanquisheth, and at his Feet down throwes, All Cares, and Dest'nies unappeas'd Mis-haps, And th'hideous Noise of Hel's still-gaping Chaps. Hee's happy too, the Country-gods that knoweth; Pan, and Sylvanus (that in Yeers now groweth) And sister-Fairies, tripping on the Lawn. He, from his settled Life, will not bee drawn By Honours Ensignes, nor by Robes of State, Nor by ambitious Thoughts that hatch Debate, And faith-lesse Brethren setteth by the Ears; Nor Treachery, amaz'd with doubtfull Fears; Nor by Rome's Glory (that now beareth Sway) Nor Kingdoms, that soon perish and decay. Hee pulingly ne'r mourneth for the Poor, Nor him envieth that is rich in Store. The Fruit, his Trees and Ground yeeld willingly, Hee gathers, and hee keepeth carefully: Nor doth hee hard and cruell Lawes behould, Now brawling Courts, where Iudgements are inroul'd. Some, Seas vnknowne with Oares molest, nor shun They murthering Steele: to Princes Courts Some run. He Cities sackes, and Matrones makes to weepe, That hee may bowze in Pearle, in Purple sleepe. From Riches hid, Another seldom slitteth; But, on his buried Gold (as brooding) sitteth. He, at the Barre struck mute, astonisht stands: Gaping for Praise, Him Shouts, and Claps of hands Ith' Theater (for, they redoubled be By Senators, and the Plebeïty) Raise like a Top, and turn-sick make with Pride. These Swaggerers hands theirs Brothers bloud have dy'd. From place to place These still do trudge and range, And their sweet Homes for Banishment do change: New fangled, from their trusty Friends they run, To seeke a Place warm'd with another Sun. The Husband-man with crookt Plough doth not spare To stir his Ground. Hence, his Revenewes are: Hence, to his Country, Scot and Lot hee paies: Hence, Sust'nance for his Houshould hee doth raise, And his young Nephews: Hence, hee doth preserve His Heards of Beasts; and Steers, that wel dezerve. Nor will it rest, but th'Yeer will set abroad His Riches, and each Bough with Fruit will load; Or great Increase will Cattell cause to yield, Or Ceres Gifts so shed in every Field, That scarce the Furrows may their Burden bear, And their large Barns asunder that will tear. Winter draws on. The Olive-berries then They grinde in Mills: The Hogs come home agen Frolick with Mast and Wildings in the Woods. And Autumn is no Niggard of his Goods: The Vessels hee to th'Brimmes with ripe Grapes fils, And presseth them forth on the sun-shine Hils. Mean-while, their pretty Babes they hugge and kiss: Milde Chastity still their House-keeper is. The Kine with strouting Vdders come to th'Pail: The wanton Kids (ith' rank Grass, by) assail, With Horns new put-forth, proudly one another: Nor to the Gods, unthankfull, doth hee smother Their Gifts; but keeps his Feasts Solemnities, And on the Grass with Flowres embrodered lies; Where, in the midst, the Fire they compass round, When his Help-fellows quaffing Boawls have crownd: Which lightly toucht, with Vowes hee calls on thee, O Bacchus. Then hee Games, for Mastery, In th'Elm to Neat-heards sets: Hee, that shoots best, Must have the Shout and Praise from all the rest. Their leather-Pelts put-off, the thick-skin Crew Themselves in untaught Wrastling tugge and tew. Long-since, the ancient Sabines lived thus: Thus Remus, and his Brother Romulus: Warlick Hetruria thus to Greatnes grew: Yea, Rome herself (to whom all Nations sue, Th'admired Minion of the World) thus rose, And in one Wall seaven Towres did thus inclose. And, long before the Cretian King did raign, And cruell People liv'd by Bullocks slain, Good Saturn thus on Earth did spend his Daies: Fearfull Alarums yet men did not raise To hatefull Wars; nor (on hard Anvils wrought With crackling noise) for slaughter Swords were sought. But now, ith' Wilde-goose-Chase o'r-hal'd with Pains, 'Tis time to loose my froathing Horses Rains. Ex M. Antonio Flaminio, ad Agellum suum. Sic incipit: Vmbræ frigidulæ, &amp;c. Cool Shades, Air-fanning Groves, With your sofe Whisperings, Where Pleasure smiling roves Through deawie Caves &amp; Springs, And bathes her purple Wings: With Flowrs inameld Ground (Nature's fair Tapestry) Where chattering Birds abound, Flickring from Tree to Tree, With Change of Melody: Sweet Liberty and Leasures, Where still the Muses keep, O! if to those true Treasures, That from your Bosoms peep, I might securely creep: If I might spend my Daies (Remote from publike Brawls) Now tuning lovely Laies, Now light-foot Madrigals, Ne'r checkt with sudden Calls: Now follow Sleep that goes Rustling ith' green-wood Shade; Now milk my Goat, that knowes (With her yong fearfull Cade) The Pail ith' cooly Glade, And with Boawls fild to th'Brims Of milky Moisture new, To water my dry'd Lims, And t'all the wrangling Crew Of Cares to bid, Adew; What Life then should I lead! How like then would it bee Vnto the Gods, that tread Ith' starry Gallery Of true Felicity! But you, O Virgins sweet, In Helicon thar dwell, That oft the Fountains greet, When you the Pleasures tell Ith' Country that excell: If I my Life, though dear, For your far dearer sake, To yeeld would nothing fear; From Citie's Tumults take-mee, And free ith' Country make-mee. FINIS. OF A BLESSED LIFE. TO THE RIGHT WORSIPFULL, S?. Richard Hvtton, Knight, one of his Maiesties Iustices in the Court of Common Pleas. If my Hopes harvest, Worthy Sir, had not Been blasted with the Breath of dull Despaire, My Muse (ne'r branded with the hatefull blot Of cheap Ingratitude, freed from base Care) The Tribute of her Love (for Causes iust) Would not so long have smothered in the Dust. Yet lookes Shee for one Sun-shine Day: Mean while, Accept these Gleanings, gathered in the Fields Of good Free-holders, in the blessed Ile, Where each one shewes (as his Affection yeelds) Who is most blest: which none can better tell, Then the sweet Singer doth of Israel. Your Worships, in his best indeavors to command, Ioh: Ashmore. Martialis, ad seipsum, vel potius ad Iulium Martialem. Lib. 10. Epigr. 47. O merrie, Martial, I mistake, A happy Life if these not make; Riches bequeath'd, not got by toyle, A fire ne'r out, no barren Soyle, No Strife, seld' Office, a Minde found Still calme, fit Strength, a Body sound, Wise Smpleness, Friends equall bred, No costly Fare, a Boord soon spred, Nights never drunk, but from Cares free, A gamesome Bed with Modestie, Sleep making Darkness short to bee. Be with thy State Content: so stay: Wish not, nor feare, thy Fatall-Day. Strigillius contra Martialem. O trifling Martial, tis most sure That these things a blest Life procure: Sense of our Sinne, an Heart relenting, Griefe for our errors, Tears repenting, And Faith, that saving Health embraceth. For, he that on this sure Rock placeth His ne'r-shak't Faith, that Christ alone (True God) our Nature hath put-on, And Vs (markt with Deaths blackest Letters, Vnto eternall Chaines and Fetters) Hath ransomd with his dearest Blood, And 'twixt God's Wrath and Vs hath stood: In Heaven he shall ('mong Heroës blest) Crownd with unblasted Bayes still rest. Perhaps, thou'l say; These words are blunt; Nor Romans so to speakar wont. O trifling Martial, tis most sure, That these things a blest Life procure. Georg. Fabricius. These things true Happiness doe teach, At which well-minded Christians reach: God rightly and thy selfe to knowe, And what thou dost thy Neighbour owe; A temperate Tongue, chaste Speech, Heart pure, A cheerfull Giver's Hand to th'Poore, A Life with small, and 's owne Content, Vnstaind Faith, and Love permanent, A Minde with good Success not drunk, Nor with disastrous chances shrunk, But which good Hope keeps, and makes bolde His Saviour Christ still to beholde. Ad Martialem. Lib. 5. Epigr. 21. If that with thee, dear Martial, I might Securely spend my dayes as I desire: If vacant time we might dispose aright, And at the last to a true life retire; No Princes Courts, nor houses would we knowe Of mighty men, nor irksome sutes would trie, Nor unto greedy Lawyers would we goe, Nor poare on a proud worm-gnawn Pedegree: But, a well-pend, and lively acted Scene, Small Brooks, Fields, Walks, fair Damsels, Bathes and Shades, Should be the Labours we would entertaine, Should be the Shops wherein we still would trade. Now, neither of vs lives t'himselfe (Alas!) But doth perceive with grief of minde, and see How fair Suns rise, and how away they pass Fruit-less to us, for which we blamed be. Doth not a man, to live that knowes the way, Cut-off encumbrances that thence him stay? Marcus Antonius Flaminius, ad Steph. Sauium: Sic incipiens. Netubeatum dixeris &amp;c. Think not (good Saul) that hee is blest Through Cities stately Gates that goes, With swarms of crouching Suters prest, And noble Peers that him inclose. No, nor if in high-rooft Barnes he Fair Affricks fertile Harvests hold, And Gems, and polisht Ivory Possess, and ruddy heaps of Gold. Nor he the secret Seales that opes Of Causes; or by skill profound Mounts to the Stars, or by Wit gropes To finde the Treasures hid ith' Ground: But him thou Blessed well mayst call, That rightly doth his God adore, And from his Precepts doth not fall, But them than Gold esteemeth more. He's not puft-up with peoples Praise; But, still God's Praise to him is dear: Which to maintaine and more to raise, Reproches he doth willing beare. And often, from Earth's Cares set free, His happy Soule to Heaven ascends; Where it enioyes the Deïtie, And parlies with celestiall Friends. And so, full fraught with heavenly Ioy, Vnto an higher pitch he riseth Than worldly Dangers can annoy, And Mens mad purposes despiseth. The Shepheard so, from petill farre, As he secure lies in his Cave, Beholds the sturdy Windes at warre With Seas, that proudly swell and rave. Lipsÿ laus, &amp; vota Vitæ beatæ. Hee's like the gods, and higher then The rest-less Race of mortall Men, That wisheth not, or (in despaire) The doubtfull Day of Death doth feare. In whom Ambition doth not raigne, That is not vext with hope of Gaine, That trembles not at Threats of Kings, Nor Darts that angry Iove down flings: But, firmely seated in one Place, Vulgar Delights doth scorne, as base: That of his Life one Tenor keeps; Secure that wakes, secure that sleeps. If I might live at mine owne pleasure, I would no Office seek, nor Treasure; Nor captive Troups should me attend, As to my Charret I ascend, Drawne by white Steeds, with Shouts and Cries; A Spectacle to gazing Eyes. In Places I remote would be: Gardens and Fields should solace me: There, at the bubbling waters noyse, I with the Muses would reioyce. So, when my Lachesis hath spun The thread of Life, she well drew on; Not unto any man a Foe, I full of Years from hence would goe, And Date my dayes in quiet state, As my good Langius did of late. Psalmus Primus Davidis. Beatus vir, &amp;c. Hee happy is, amongst the brain-sick Crue Of ill-advising men, that doth not walk; Nor the lewd Path of wicked men pursue, Of holy things that dare profanely talke; Nor in the Scorners chaire sits (swoln with Pride) That God contemne, and Godliness deride. But hee seeks-out farre-better Wayes to tread, Led (in the winding Labyrinth of this Life) By his Creator's Lawes, as a sure thread That guides him through cross-wayes of worldly Strife. By it, his Words and Actions he doth frame: Earely and late he thinks upon the fame. Hee's like a thick-leav'd tree, that planted is By the green Bank of som smooth-gliding Stream, That with his fruitfull armes stretcht-forth doth bliss The Labourers Paines: which Phœbus with his beam Doth ne'r so search, nor Winters rage can stay, But yearly Rent she to her Lord will pay. So shall not the ungodly and unkinde Despisers of Gods Statutes and his Grace, That (with themselves at war) no Rest can finde; But, like the Chaf, are tost from place to place With every sudden blast of Winde that bloweth, Which scorns their lightness, and to Heaven it sheweth. For, when the iust Iudge comes in a bright Cloud, Circled with Angels, cloath'd with Maiesty, The wicked (daunted) will cry-out aloud, Cashierd from Saints for their impiety. For, as in good mens Wayes God takes Delight, So he o'r-throwes all wicked By-wayes quite. FINIS.</field>
