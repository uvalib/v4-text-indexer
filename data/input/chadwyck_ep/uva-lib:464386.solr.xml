All faithfull, herkin, &amp; to my wordis attend, And ernistlie do merk thame til ane end; Ponder thame weill, and wey thaim in ?our hart; Ilk stait of man, consider ?our awin part, And Iudge me nocht, that I haue done indyte This lytle Tractate of malice or dispyte, Bot for ane warnyng to the impenitent, And for the confort of thame that doth repent, As may all faithfull graip, and als considder, Layand the Text and this my werk togidder, Humblie exhorting euerie Creature, Learnd, vnlearnd, auld, ?ung, ryche and pure, To take heirfor my sayings in gude part, Sen I do write thame of ane zealus hart, As God me Iudge, quho knawis the mynd &amp; thocht Of euerye wicht that in this warld is wrocht. So to my Text now breuelie to proceid, Grit God me help, and with his spreit me speid! THE DIUISIOUN OF THE TEXT. This part of Text quhilk I am to discyde, In to two headis‚Äîwill God‚ÄîI sall deuyde: The first head, the punyschement sall be Of wekit Synnairis for thair Iniquytie; And speciallie, the tormentis heir I schaw Of thame that dois contem Godis wourd &amp; Law, And how the wekit ar nocht ingraft in Christ, Bot ar the Children of the Antechrist. The secund head sall be the riche rewaird The Godlie gettis, quhilk dois thair God regaird, And how tha ar ingraft in Christ Iesu, Iho. x[v.]Be the imbracing of his wourd most trew. [THE FIRST HEAD.] THE DISCRIPTIOUN OF THE FIRST HEAD. So now returnand till our first head agane, Aduert, and ?e sall heir the crewell pane, The sorrowfull Sentence and terribill decreit, In to few wourdis ar heir contenit compleit, That is prepaird for wekit Creaturs, And vicius men that in to Uice indurs. For thame that drownd ar in Idolatrie, For poysond pepill with Infidelytie, For stif contemnars of gods lyuelie wourd, This suthfast Sentence; allace, it is no bourd! Math. [v.]It is no Sentence be Man retreattabill, i. Peter [iv.]It is no Sentence be man debaittabill, Esa. lvi[ii.]It nowthair sparis King nor Empriour, Duke, Erll, Lord, nor pussant Conquyrour; It nowthair sparis mychtie men nor pure, Iere. i.That of the wourd of God doith tak no cure; Bot is ane Sentence quhilk none can do eschew That dois contem the wourd of Christ Iesu. This Sentence merkit, the pepill we discus That doith nocht abyde in Christ Iesus. ANE GENERALL DISCRIPTIOUN OF THAME THAT BYDIS NOCHT IN CHRIST. In Christ tha byde nocht, we do vnderstand, The quhilk, aggreing vnto his command, Dois nocht imbrace his wourd most louynglie, With feruent mynd and hart most constantlie, And in that wourd hes nocht ane solyde faith: Thir bydis nocht in Christ, the Scripture saith, Bot ar Inuoluit in-to dung-hillis of Sin, And euerye daye frome Sin to Sin tha rin. It sufficis nocht that we Baptizit be, Bot it requyris als, of necessitie, [I]hon. xv. That we contynew in Christs Euangell trew, Math. x. Or ellis we can nocht byde in Christ Iesu. [ii.] Tim. ii. ANE DISCRIPTIOUN OF THAME IN SPECIALL THAT BYDIS NOCHT IN TO CHRIST. The Romane Kirk, and all of that degre, Quhilk dois menteane peruerst Idolatrie, [G]al. ii. and [iii.] Sic as the Messe, (quhilk is plane derogatioun To Christ[i]s glore and his most blissed Passioun,) With all the rabill of tha Sophistis and Clerks That doith ascryue Saluatioun to thair werks, Or attributis Remissioun of thair Sin To ony wicht that is the warld within, Tha pepill, I say, doith nocht abyde in Christ, Bot ar the Children of the Antechrist.

Dois wag about aye as the busse it wags, Neathir tha pepill that for feir of thair lyues, [L]uc. ix. [a]nd xiiii. And tinsall of thair houshaldis, bairnis, and wyues, Math. x. And lose of guds, [&amp;] gear, or wardlie rent, Frome God[i]s wourd thame selues doith absent; Nor tha that dois, for pleasure of thair Prence, [A]ct. iiii.Refuse Gods wourd, of maist magnificence. And sure it is, quho treulie list discydit, God will nocht haue that man that is deuydit; Bot he will haue him, Saule and bodye haill; [ii.] Cor. vi.Quho is deuydit, his faith doith nocht auaill. Dissemblit pepill doith nocht abyde in Christ, Bot ar the children of the Antechrist. And as the faithfull in Christ ingraftit be, Be his Euangell and wourd of Ueritie, Iho. viii. and xv.So is the Kirk malignant, but more plead, Ingraft in Sathan,‚Äîof that ilk kirk thair head,‚Äî With dewillysche doctrine, and Idolatrie Of thame that speykis leis throw Ypocresie. OF THE GREUOUS TORMENTIS PREORDINAT FOR THE WEKIT. Quhat end makis thir to proceid furthirmair? Ioan. xv.Tha ar cast furth, the Text this doith declair, Maist lyke ane branche doun cuttit of ane stok, That is becum ane drye and widderit blok. Meit for no werk that man wald do desyre, Bot to be brint, and cassin in ane fyre. Euin so the curst Contemnaris of the treuth, And wekit wirkars, for thair Sin and sleuth, Gal. v.That will nocht do the wourd of Christ imbrace, Ar clene dryit vp frome euerye kynd of grace, And hes no pairt with Christ, nor with his glore, Moir nor the widderit branche, the quhilk before I said had Iusse or Sapour of the tre, Quhen it is cuttit, and dois frome growing de. Tha ar cum drye with Lust and carnall heit, Because tha want the Sapour of the spreit Of Christ Iesus, the Sauiour of man. Wanting this Iusse, quhairfor ar tha meit than? For nothing ellis,‚Äîthe text it schewis plane,‚Äî Ioan. xv. Bot to sustene of Hellis fyre the pane, Exo. iiii. [v.] vi. vii. vi[ii.] As Nero sufferit for his tirrannye, And Pharao for his grit Ydolatrie, And as the gluttoun quho refusit Lazarus, Luc. ix. With mony mo nor heir I may discus. So thus the wekit; tha get no vther hyre, Ihon. xv. Bot for thair Sin ar brint in flam of fyre, Aye daylie deand, and neuer ?it can de; Thus endis the wekit, for thair Iniquytie. Math. iii. Bot lat ws heir the text perfytlie feill, Esa. lxvi. And lat ws merk the wourdis thairof richt weill, As quhair it sayis nocht that, ‚Äòthat man sall be ‚ÄòCast furth that bydis nocht in Christ constantlie,‚Äô Bot speykand in the present tyme it sayis, Ihon. iii. and xv. ‚ÄúHe is reieckit now instantlie alwayis.‚Äù Albeit on lyfe that ?it he leuand be, He is cast furth: the text this latts ws se. So heir the text pronuncis till ws plat, That Christ, he speykis heir of the reprobat;‚Äî For as the faithfull, now leuyng heir but more, Ar partakers with Christ in heauinnis glore, [I]hon. v. And dois begin thair heauin in earth heir doun, Quhen as tha thole soir persecutioun For richtyusnes, takand in pacience [i] Pet. iiii. All earthlie trubill, knawand thair Innocence, Hayfand respect, and still in memore, The heauinnis Ioye and grit felicite That thay at last be Christ ar till obtene, Quhen as tha knaw thair conscience is clene Of sik Iniury as wes thair accusatioun, This earthlie trubill is thair grit consolatioun, Quhilk consolatioun, it is the waye full euin, And pleasand passage, vnto the port of heauin. The quhilk begynnis in to this wrachit ground, As in the Scripture cleirlie may be found, Quhair as it sayis, and writtin is expres, ‚ÄúBe mony trublis, sorrowis, and distres, Act. iiii.‚ÄúThe godlie sall in heauin haue thair Intrance, Thair to posses thair Iust inheritance.‚Äù Euin so all thay, to speyk in wourdis breue, That godlie will in to Christ Iesus leue, ii Tim. iii.Man thame addres, his Croce for to vptake, And suffer persecutioun for his saike, As the Appostilis and Propheits nocht possest Heb. ii.The heauinnis glore in earth with wardlie rest, Bot sum tholit death, and sum richt sore torment, Heir vpon earth, or tha till heauin vp went;‚Äî Directlie speakand in the contrarie, Of wekit pepill that leuis sinfullie, To quhome also is knawin the wourd of God, And wilfullie dois rin the contrair rod In werk and wourd, in thocht and in Intent Expresse aganis the Lordis commandiment, Heb. vi. and x.Contynewand thus in thair Sin and offence, This man can neuer haue peace in conscience; Quhilk peace quho wantis, the treuth most trew to tel, Is the begynning of the paynis of Hell. Quhilk paynis infernal begynnis lykewyse, we se, In to this earth, and Uaill of miserie. Quho wants this rest and peace of conscience, Of this may haue ane sure experience. For quhill he leuis, his conscience tryis and berks Gods wraith to wrak him for his wekit werks; Quhen he is dead, his conscience sall accuse him, And him condamp, quhair he hes done abuse him. And as the faithfull, now leuand heir on lyfe, Of all degre, baith Infant, man, and wyfe, Hes now in Heauin, of Gods especiall grace, Ilk ane thair awin preparit roum and place, So hes the wekit leuand, I ?ow tell, Ilk ane thair awin appoyntit rowmes in Hell. To tell quho ar Eleckit or refusit, I can nocht saye; thairin hald me excusit; Can nane thair-of haue sik experience As man him self, grapand his awin conscience. Lyke as the man that finds his lyfe aggre To Gods command and wourd of verite, And hes ane feruent mynd to perseueir Under the reull of God[i]s wourd sinceir, Syne dois continew as Gods word dois direc him, That man may knaw that God hes done elec him; And with the wekit, thocht still he be suspeckit, ?it still the faithfull may compt him as eleckit. And in the contrair, accompt this for no bourd, Quho dois contempne of God the lyuelie wourd.

To mak the consolatioun the moir Of his Discyplis, he speakis the sam heirfoir; And for to draw thame till ane constancie, He schewis thame the grit Utilitie That followis thame that in him dois abyde, In to few wourds he dois the sam discyde: Christ sayis thir wourds, ‚Äúgyf ?e will byde in me, ‚ÄúThairthrow ?e sall obtene grit proffittis thre.‚Äù Ioan. xv.

THE FIRST COMMODITE OF THAME THAT ABYDIS IN TO CHRIST. THE TEXT. ASK QUHAT ?E WILL. IT SALL BE GEUIN VNTO ?OW. First, in this Spirituall Unioun we haue [I]oan. xv. Quhat richtius thing of Christ that we sal craue. Quhat better thing can man seik for his hyre, Nor get all thing he Iustlie will desyre? No better thing can onye crayf or wys, In to this earth on lyfe that leuing is, Nor haue all thingis to thame performit and done That Godlie is, be the grit God abone, Ioan. xv. For the imbrasing of his wourd most trew, i Ioan. [ii.] And so to be Ingraft in Christ Iesu. I compt thame daft, and mekill wors nor mad, That laykis this gift, so lichtlie may be had, Sekand the sam vpon ane vther ground, Quhilk be no vther maner can be found. Sen Christ hes promist this to his faithful all, Be this Coniunctioun and Unioun Spirituall, Ioan. vi[i.] et. xvi.I saye it is bot verraye Uanytie For to desyre Christ with ws corporallie. It is the Spreit that quyknis auld and ?ing; The corporall flesche, it proffittis no thing: ‚ÄúWithout,‚Äù sayis Christ, ‚Äúmy body do ascend, The Confortour to ?ow I can nocht send.‚Äù Mar. vi[ii.]Thus it behouit Christ of necessitie Luc. iiii.Unto the Father to passe vp reallie, Ioan. xv[i.]Quhair he abydis, and euer sall remane Heb. x.Quhill he discend to Iudge the warld agane. Act. vii.For vthirwyse, gyf Christ had nocht ascendit, Ioan. xv[i.]The holy Gost till ws had nocht discendit. Thow can not, Papist, be Scripture mak it kend That Christ sensyne did corporallie discend. How is it than thow thinkis no schame to le, To say thow makis him, and eytis him carnallie? Now may it heir be sperit and demandit, And gude it wer that we suld vnderstandit, Quhat is the cause the Kirk Papisticall Can neuer haue this Unioun Spirituall Of Christ Iesus trewlie in thame ingrauit? The cause is this, sa fer as I perceauit, Ioan. vi[i.]That so lang as tha seyk him carnallie, [Ma]th. vxi.Tha can no wayis posses him Spirituallie. As the Appostillis, beleuing Christ to ring [M]ath. xvi. [x]xv.In earth amangs thame as ane temporall King, So lang as tha of this had Esperance, [I]oan. viii.Tha euer leuit still in Ignorance, And neuer knew quhat Christ ment in his teaching, [Lu]c. ix. For all his daylie and contynewall preaching; No moir sall neuer no carnall Creature‚Äî So lang as tha sall fleschelie Folkis Indure,‚Äî Cum to the knowledge and intelligence [i C]or. ii. Of God[i]s wourd, and Spirituall pure sentence, Thocht Angellis wer to preache it to thame plane; Preue quho so please, thair laubour sall be vane. Now falls it weill to vs to wey but moir, Quhat wes the cause, the reasoun, and quhairfoir [Hug]o Be[ren]g. de [Tour]se. The Papistis said ‚Äòtha maid Christ Reallie ‚ÄòIn to thair Messe, and Eate him carnallie.‚Äô [Colo]s. ii. As I perceaue, it wes, that tha and thairs Mycht stylit be ‚Äúmost holy God-makairs,‚Äù And thairthrow cum to warldlie Pomp and gloir, Richt as tha did;‚Äîfor nane micht clim to moir; For Papis precellit the Kings in Dignytie, And Cardinals wes Compan?eonis to our Kings; For with my Eis my self did se thir things;‚Äî This mouit thame that werk till Interpryse, Quhilk montit thame on sic ane prydfull wyse. And thocht sum schaifling wald haue ilk nycht in cure Ane Concubyne, ane Harlote, or ane Hure, With gaping, Iowking, with mony bek and nod, Upon the morne he wald haue maid ?ow God!

Grit God we pray, sen Prencis wald perceaue, And it in to thair hart[i]s deiplie graue, How be tha Iuglours tha haue bene blindlynes led, With deuillysche Doctrine fosterit and fed! Na dout, gude Lord, bot than tha wald refuse it, Quhen as tha knew how tha haue bene abuse-it! ANE QUESTIOUN DIRECT TO ALL PAPISTIS, DEMANDING GYF CHRIST CAN BE SEPARET FROME THE FAITHFULL. Can Christ be frome thame, that he do[is] stil support, Mathew. xxviii.And grants to thame thair will in lauchfull sort? No! thair is none of Iudgement discreit, Esay. xlv.Can saye bot he is present in the Spreit Psal. c.xx. ix.Still in to thame that ar his trew Eleckit, Least tha alwayis with Sin suld be subieckit, I mene, with grit and odious transgressioun, Siclyke as thift, reif, murthour, and oppressioun; For thocht the richtyus doith seuin tymes daylie Sin, ?it dois he nocht contynew still thairin; For, be his Spreit Christ geuis thame Iudgement To knaw thair Sin; syne maks thame to repent, So that tha do nocht in thair Sin delyte, Bot murnis thairfor with conscience contryte, As Dauid, Peter, and the Magdalene, With mony mo nor heir I may contene. Heb. i.Christ als is with thame, as Uicar generall, Rewlar and gydar of the faithfull all, Without quhais spreit no gude thing can be wrocht; Without his help our strenth aualis nocht; Act. xvii.In him we leue and mouis quhill we indure, It is he onlie, that taks on ws cure; Thus none can saye, but Christ most certanlie Is be his Spreit with ws contynewallie. So till his Kirk, Christ heir before his Passioun Repeatis thir wourdis, to gyf thame consolatioun, Ioan. xiiii.That tha in that suld nocht discuragit be For his deperting frome thame corporallie, Mathew. xxviii.Bot be his Spreit he promist stil support thame; So on this wayis Christ Iesus did confort thame, ‚ÄúHowbeit,‚Äù sayis he, ‚ÄúI am to passe abone; ‚ÄúAsk quhat ?e will, it sall to ?ow be done; ‚ÄúProuyding alwayis that ?e constant be ‚ÄúAbyding at my wourd of Uerite.‚Äù This consolatioun dois serue for ws also, Assuring ws, quhair euer we ryde or go, ?e, euin amyd our Inymeis most grit, [R]om. xv.

With Deligence now lat ws all heirfore Imbrace Christ Iesus, that we may cum to glore, And in tymes cumming lat none so ernistlie pance On earthlie glore, that lestis bot ane glance; Bot lat our laubour, studie, and Meditatioun, Be euer bent to seik for our Saluatioun; And deiplie in our hartis lat ws considder, None can serue God &amp; Mammone boith togidder. Wo worth the landis, the gudis, gear, and flesche, That dois man frome this heuinlie glore depesche! To the quhilk glore, now breiflie to conclude, Mot bring ws Christ, that bocht ws with his blude! So be it. Glore, Honour, Prayse, and Laude, Eternallie, To God, for this Pure Werk! and none to me, Quod Lauder. The Lamenta[t]ioun OF THE PURE. TWICHING THE MISERABILL ESTAIT OF THIS PRESENT WARLD. COMPYLIT BE WILLIAM LAUDER. AT PERTH. PRIMO FABRUARIE. 1568. [How lange, Lorde, sall this warld indure?] This warld is war nor euer it was! Full of myscheif, and all malure; Fals and fragell as the glas! How lang, Lorde, sall this warld indure? For mony dois Godis worde profes, Bot for to keip it, few takis cure, Thay ar so bent to weikitnes! How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? Now euerie fat Sow feidis ane vther, And few hes pitie on the Pure; Couatice gydis and rewlis the Ruder: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? The men quhome God hes rychelie dotit, Abhorris the emptye Creature, Cheiflie Protestantes, lat ws notit How lang, Lord, wyll, this warld indure? ?it ar nocht thir Protestantes trew, Bot Ipocretis, I am most sure, That hes renuncit Christ Iesu: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? Frome fraude, [frome] falset, and frome gyle, No Preaching can the pepill allure: Lawtie and luife ar in exile: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? Hipocrasie, vaine Glore, and Pryde, Now blawis thair Bugillis strang and sture; Simplysitie is sett on syde: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? The reuth that Papistis hes, I saye, On thame that beggis frome dure to dure, Sall ws accuse on Domesdaye: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure Now mony vsis Sosserie, Doand the deuylis of Hell coniure, Seikand to knaw how all sulde be: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? Iustice is rowpit, as vtheris waris; This is most plane, and nocht obscure, The pur√© Pepill it declaris: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? The falsest Actioun that may be, Sall no wayis want ane Procuture; The Deuyll, he wyll get one for fe: How lang, Lord, wyll this warlde indure? Loude leand Lowreis, for thair sleuth Was treatit, passing throw mosse and Mure: Upon trew Preacheouris few hes reuth: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? Credit and frist is quyte away, No thing is lent bot for Usure; For euerie penny thay wyll haue tway: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? For auld kyndnes thow sall nocht get Bot Magerie, Malice, and Iniure; Auld gude done dedis ar quyte for?et: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? The dayntie Dammis may nocht sustene The faithfull, for to fyle thair flure, Bot treatis thame that tryit trumpouris bene: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? Ane fen?eit flatterair or Fuile, I say, Ane Barde, ane Bragger, or Bordell Hure; Ar none treatit so weill as thay: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? In all the earth is no thing wer In to no earthlie Creature, Nor heicht into ane Minister: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? ?it Papistis bearis ilke ane to vther More liberall luife, I am moste sure, Nor dois sum Minister to his Brother: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? And now the Dochter and the Sone Lichtlyis the Mother that thame bure, And for?ettis quhat thair Father hes done: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? Of this Iniure and dispyte Wrocht of all cankerit Creature, I saye Godis wourd hes nocht the wyte: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? For to behauld this Miserie, My breist in baill it dois combure, Sen reuth is none, nor ?it Pitie: How lang, Lord, wyll this warld indure? Sen all Estaitis this gois astray, Lat no man think bot this is sure, That God wyll Plaig ws but delay, For thus we can nocht lang indure. Quhairfore, lat euerie Creature, The Mercyis of grit God procure, That we may ones Inbrace the Lycht Of Heauin, quhilk euer sall indure. FINIS. Quod Lauder. Ane prettie Mirrour Or Conference, betuix the faithfull Protestant and the Dissemblit false Hypocreit. In to the quhilk may be maist easylie perceaued &amp; knawin the one from the vther. Compylit be William Lauder Minister of the wourd of God. For the Instructioun, Confort, and Consolatioun of all Faithfull Professours. To quhome he wyssith Grace Mercy and Peace, in Jesus Christ our Lord, and onlie Sauiour. So be it. Luke in to this Mirrour, and thow sall cleirlie ken All faithfull trew Christianes, from fals dissemblit men. To the faithful Reder. Thir Uearse ar sweit and rycht delicius Unto the hartis of Godlie men, I ken; But to the weked tha ar rycht odius, And comptit folie with all vnfaithful men. For of the Godlie, that schew the trade and ways, How tha thame selfis heir vpon earth dois gyde; And of the weked, thair vice and grit decaye; Quhilk manassing tha can no wayis abyde. Humblie heirfore I walde ilk man exhort Thame self to trye out, be this subsequent, Gyf vice or virtew dois maist in thame resort: Quha findis him gyltie, God grant he may repent! So be it. Begynnis the Conferrence. The chosin children of God, and sones elect, Reiosis cheiflie to heir his blissit wourd: The sons of sathan, quhilkis ar from God reiect, Abhorris that same more nor ane two edgit swourd. The Godlie will with pacience Imbrace Dew Admonitioun for thair vice and sin: The wekit can nocht, in the contrair cace, Sustene reproche, syne byde thair wittis within. The godlie will in to gude pairt sustene, Dew chaistisment for thair Sin and offence: Punysche the wekit, tha will alwayis complene, As geue tha wer opprest be violence. The godlie men with pietie ar opprest To see thair Brethren in necessitie: The Hypocreitis ar neuer at ease nor rest But quhen the faithfull sustenis miserie. The Godlie men will do no man bakbyte, Nowthair in patent nor in to priuie place: In blasphemie the wekit dois delyte, And frome Iniurie his toung can neuer cease. The Godlie man will vse no mokkerie, And will no wayis with sic vaine maters mell: The Hypocreit will skorne contynewallie, And neuer can finde ane falt in to him sell. The Godlie men will vse no fraude nor gylis, And will be laith to sute men to the law: The Hypocreitis ar euer breding wylis, And passing how, thair broder to owrthraw. The Godlie men ar full of gentilnes, Of Lawtie, Loue, and liberalitie: The Hypocreitis ar full of gredines, Of Aueryce, and Pegeralitie. The Godlie men, tha do support the pure, And geuis thame glaidlie of thair geir and gude: The Hypocreitis dois take more thocht and cure How tha may reaue from thame thair daylie fude. The Godlie men Elykewise ar content, Als weill in neid as in prosperitie: The Hypoccreitis, quhen geir is frome thame went, Tha blaspheme God in thair aduersitie. The Godlie men detestis all vice and Sin, And all transgressouris and thair companie: The Hypocreitis, tha do delyte thairin, Leading thair lyues in all Impietie. The Godlie men, no brybs nor buds will take, To hurt the ane pairt, nor to helpe the vther: The Hypocreit will thinke no schame nor lak, Buds to receaue, and tha wer fra his broder. The Godlie men will serue ane God allone, Quhilk maker is of Heauin, the earth, and seye: The Hypocretis makis gods mony one, With quhome tha do commit Idolatrie. The Godlie men in all thair wayis ar plaine, And cheiflie euer onto thair faithfull brother: The Hypocreitis ar fen?eit, fals, and vaine; Will saye ane thing, and syne will do ane vther. The Godlie ar repleit with lawlynes, With louyng kyndnes, and humelytie: The Hypocreitis, thocht tha it nocht expres, Ar full of hicht, dispyte, and tyrannie. The Godlie labours for vnitie and peace, For concorde, kyndnes, and tranquilytie: The Hypocreitis dois neuer stanche nor cease To rais discorde and Innanymitie. The Godlie luffis thair Pastours, for thair cure, And will be sorie to se thame want or wrangt: The Hypocreitis regairds nocht, we ar sure, Thocht all the preachours on the earth wer hangt. The Godlie men will still cleue to Gods wourd, Thocht tha to death for it suld be persewit: The Hypocreit, sa sone as cummis the swourd, Will it denye, and sweir he neuer knewit. The Godlie men setts God before all things, Before thair lyues, thair guds, [&amp;] geir, or lands: The Hypocreitis, before God puts thair kings, Dispysing God, his lawis, and his commands. The Godlie men ar knawin be thir merks, Rycht as the daye is tryit be the lycht: Euin so the wekit, be thair vicius werks Ar so espyit, as derknes schewis the nycht. For as no wayis, the fyre, it can be knawin To be ane fyre, withouttin heit or lycht: No more the faithfull, except gude werks be schawin, Can notit be for to be Christianes rycht. The preist, &amp; Leueit, the quhilk did nocht support Luc. x. The woundit man in to his greif and paine, Could nocht be comptit faithful in no sort Luc. xvi. As was the helpfull trew Samaritaine. Nor ?it the Gluttoun, quha fed delicius, Could nocht be said to haue fidelytie, That petiit nocht the pur√© Lazarus, Quhen Dogs did schew in him more cherytie. Q[u]hairthrow the Gluttoun vnto the hell was sent, That had no reuth nor pietie on the pure: All Hypocreitts that lykewise dois offend, With him in Hell sall harbreit be most sure. Thus, thocht we boist, Christianes to be, Except gude werks proceid out of our spreits, We ar bot membris of Iniquytie, And ar nocht els bot verray Hypocreits. Lat ws heirfore schew furth with al our mycht Our godlie werks of mercy and of loue: Quhairthrow we may be kend of euery wycht, The faithfull seruands of God that rings aboue. Lat leud affectionis and all Impieteis Be mortefiit in to our membris all, That tha may nocht, quhilks ar our Inymeis, No vther thing bot Christianes ws call. Godlie, heirfore Reioyse, that hes thir sings! ?e may be sure that God hes ?ow elect! Bewaill, ?e weked, that in sick vicis rings! But ?e repent, the Lord hes ?ow reiect! All ?e, heirfore, that hes Gods wourd profest, And maid with God and man, that blyssit band, Stand ferme and stable, gyf ?e wald cum to rest, for now the Fan approchis fast at hand. Se that no ryches, nor wardlie pomp nor glore, Mak ws schrink bak now frome the veritie! And quho so dois, to thair grit schame but more, God will disclose thair vile Hypocresie. Eternall God! thy faithfull flok defend! Preserue thame, Lord, for now and euer more! And grace, and peace, vnto thy subiects send, That seiks nocht els, bot to set furth thy glore! Quod William Lauder. Ane trew &amp; breue Sentencius Discriptioun of y? nature of Scotland Twiching the Interteinment of virtewus men That laketh Ryches. Compyld be William Lauder, Minister of Gods wourd. &amp;c. Howbeit thow war of portrature preclair, And war indewit with prignant virteuis seir, And thocht in knawledge thou had no compair, That thou culd teache all sciencis perqueir, And thocht of blude thow war ane prencis peir, ?it in this Realme, I Lat the vnderstand, And thow Layk substance of thy awin, and geir, Thow will be Lytill regardit in this Land. Bot thocht thow be ane Ideote, or ane fule, Ane maykles monstour, withoutin wit or lair, Ane Blunt bubo, that neuer had bene at scule, And sik as Is of euerye virtew bair, ?it haue thow gudis and geir, I the declair,‚Äî Thoucht thow be weked, I put the out of dout,‚Äî And thocht thow war to sathane, Sone &amp; air, ?it for thy bagis thow sall be takin owt. Allace! heir is ane Cairfull Miserie! That virtewis men but geir ar of no pryce, And Beasts, for bags, ar in Authorytie! I think this change is wonderus strange &amp; nyce! The caus heirof Is onlie Couattyse, That blinds so man that he can no wayis se To cheryse virtew, And ay chaistyce vice: Allace! heir is ane cairfull misere! quod Lauder. Neathir virtew nor wit, in to this weked land Doith proffeit thame that hes nocht gudis in hand. Ane GVDE EXEMPILL. BE THE BUTTERFLIE, INSTRUCTING MEN TO HAIT ALL HARLOTTRIE.
