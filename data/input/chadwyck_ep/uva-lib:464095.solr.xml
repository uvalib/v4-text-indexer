      <field name="fulltext">SOME fewe of Dauids Psalms Metaphrased, for a taste of the rest. TO MY LOVING and learned Cosen, M? Samvel Bvrton, Archdeacon of Glocester. Psal. 1. In the tune of 148. Psalme; Giue laud vnto the Lord. 1 Who hath not walkt astray, In wicked mens advise, Nor stood in sinners way; Nor in their companyes That scorners are, As their fit mate, In scoffing chayre, Hath euer sate; 2But in thy lawes diuine, O Lord sets his delight, And in those lawes of thine Studies all day and night; Oh, how that man Thrise blessed is! And sure shall gaine Eternall blisse. 3He shall be like the tree, Set by the water-springs, Which when his seasons be Most pleasant fruite forth-brings: Whose boughes so greene Shall neuer fade, But couered bene With comely shade. So, to this happy wight, All his designes shall thriue: 4Whereas the man vnright, As chaff which winds do driue, With euery blast Is tost on hy, Nor can at last In safety lie. 5Wherefore, in that sad doome, They dare not rise from dust: Nor shall no Sinner come To glory of the iust. For, God will grace The Iust-mans way; While sinners race Runs to decay. Psal. 2. In the tune of the 125. Psalme; Those that do put their conf. 1 Why do the Gentils tumults make, And nations all conspire in vain, 2And earthly Princes counsell take Against their God; against the raigne 3Of his deere Christ? let vs, they saine, Break al their bonds: &amp; from vs shake Their thraldoms yoke, &amp; seruile chain. 4VVhiles thus alas they fondly spake, He that aloft rides on the skies, Laughs all their leud deuise to scorne 5And when his wrathfull rage shal rise, With plagues shal make the al forlorne, And in his fury thus replyes; 6But I, my King with sacred horne Anointing, shall in princely guise His headwith royall crowne adorne. Upon my Syons holy mount His Empires glorious seat shall be. And I thus rais'd shall farre recount The tenour of his true decree: 7My Son thou art, said God, I thee Begat this daie by due account: Thy scepter, do but ask of mee, All earthly kingdomes shall surmount. 8All nations, to thy rightfull sway, will subiect; from furthest end 9Of all the world: and thou shalt bray Those stubborn foes that wil not bend, With iron mace (like potters clay) 10In pieces small: Ye Kings attend; And ye, whom others wont obay, Learne wisedome, and at last amend. 11See, ye serue God, with greater dread Then others you: and in your feare Reioice the while; and (lowely spred) 12Do homage to his sonne so deare: Least he be wroth, and do you dead 13Amids your way. If kindeled His wrath shalbe; O blessed those, That do on him their trust repose. Psal. 3. As the 113. Psalme; Ye Children which, &amp;c. 1 Ah Lord! how many be my foes! How many are against me rose, 2That to my grieued soule haue sed, Tush: God shall him no succour yield; 3whiles thou Lord art my praise, my shield And dost aduance my carefull head. 4Loud with my voice to God I cri'd: His grace vnto my sute reply'd, From out his Sions holy hill. 5I layd me downe, slept, rose againe. For thou O Lord dost me sustaine, And sav'st my soule from feared ill. 6Not if ten thousand armed foes My naked side should round enclose, Would I be thereof ought a-dred. Up Lord and shield me from disgrace: 7For thou hast broke my foe-mens face, And all the wickeds teeth hast shed. 8From thee O God is safe defence; Do thou thy free beneficence Vpon thy people largely spred. Psal. 4. As the x. Commandements; Attend my People. 1 Thou witnesse of my truth sincere, My God vnto my poore request Uouch-saue to lend thy gracious eare: Thou hast my soule from thral releast. 2Fauour me still, and daigne to heare Mine humble sute. O wretched wights, 3How long will yee mine honour deare Turn into shame through your despites? Still will ye loue what thing is vaine, 4And seek false hopes? know th? at last, That God hath chose &amp; will maintain His fauorite, whom ye disgrac't. God will regard mine instant mone. 5Oh! tremble then, and cease offending; And, on your silent bed alone, Talk with your harts, your waies amending. 6Offer the truest sacrifice Of broken hearts; on God besetting 7Your only trust. The most deuise The waies of worldly treasure getting: But thou, O Lord, lift vp to mee The light of that sweet lookes of thine; 8So shall my soule more gladsome be, Then theirs with al their corn &amp; wine. 9So I in peace shall lay me down, And on my bed take quiet sleep; Whiles thou, O Lord, shalt me alone From dangers all securely keep. Psal. 5. In the tune of 124. Psalme; Now Israel may say, &amp;c. 1 Bow downe thine eare Lord to these words of mine, And well regarde the secret plaints I make. 2My King, my God, to thee I do betake My sad estate oh do thine eare incline To these loud cryes that to thee powred bin. 3At early morne thou shalt my voyce attend: For, at day breake, I will my selfe addresse Thee to implore, and waite for due redresse. 4Thou dost not Lord delight in wickednesse; Nor to bad men wilt thy protection lend. 5The boasters proud cannot before thee stay: Thou hat'st all those that are to sinne deuoted: 6The lying lippes, &amp; who with bloud are spotted, Thou doost abhorre, and wilt for euer slaie: 7But I vnto thine house shall take the way, And through thy grace aboundant shall adore, With humble feare within thine holy place. 8Oh! lead me Lord within thy righteous trace: Euen for their sakes that malice me so sore, Make smooth thy paths my dimmer eyes before. 9Within their mouth no truth is euer found: Pure mischiefe is their heart: a gaping toome 10Is their wide throate; &amp; yet their tongues stil sound 11With smoothing words. O Lord giue them their doom, And let them fall, in those their plots profound. In their excesse of mischiefe them destroy 12That rebells are; so those that to thee flie Shall all reioice and sing eternally: 13And whom thou dost protect, and who loue thee, And thy deare name, in thee shall euer ioy. Since thou with blisse the righteous dost reward, And with thy grace as with a shield him guard. Psal. 6. As the 50. Psalme; The mighty God, &amp;c. 1 Let mee not Lord be in thy wrath reproued: Oh! scourge mee not when thy fierce rage is moued. 2Pity mee, Lord, that do with languor pine: Heale mee whose bones with paine dissolued bin; 3Whose weary soule is vexed aboue measure. Oh Lord how long shall I 'bids thy displeasure! 4Turne thee O Lord, rescue my soule distrest; 5And saue me, of thy grace. Mongst those that rest, In silent death can none remember thee: And in the graue how shouldst thou praised be? 6Weary with sighs, all night I caus'd my bed To swim: with teares my couch I watered. 7Deepe sorrow hath consum'd my dimmed eyne, Sunk in with griefe at these leud foes of mine: 8But now hence, hence, vaine plotters of mine ill: The Lord hath heard my lamentations shrill; 9God heard my suit and still attends the same: 10Blush now, my foes, and fly with sudden shame. Psal. 7. As the 112. Psalme; The man is blest that God doth feare. 1 On thee, O Lord my God, relyes Mine only trust: fr? bloody spight Of all my raging enemies Oh! let thy mercy me acquite; 2Least they like greedy Lyons rend My soule, whiles none shal it defend 3Oh Lord! if I this thing haue wrought, If in my hands be found such ill: 4If I with mischief euer sought To pay good turnes; or did not still Doe good vnto my causelesse foe, That thirsted for my ouerthrowe; 5Then let my foe, in eager chace, Ore take my soule, and proudly tread My life belowe; and with dis-grace In dust lay downe mine honor dead. 6Rise vp in rage, O Lord, eft-soone Aduance thine arm against my fo'ne: And wake for me till thou fulfil 7My promis'd right; so shal glad throngs Of people flock vnto thine hill. For their sakes then reuenge my wr?gs, 8And rouse thy self. Thy iudgements be O'real the world: Lord iudge thou me; As truth and honest innocence Thou find'st in me, Lord iudge thou me 9Settle the iust with sure defence: Let me the wicked's malice see 10Brought to an end. For thy iust eye Doth hearts and inward reyns descry 11My safety stands in God; who shields The sound in hart: whose doom each day 12To iust men and contemners yields 13Their due. Except he change his waie His sword is whet, to bloud intended, His murdring bowe is ready bended. 14Weapons of death he hath addrest And arrowes keene to pearce my foe, 15Who late bred mischiefe in his brest; But when he doth on trauell goe, 16Brings forth a ly. Deep pits he delues, And falls into his pits himselue. 17Back to his own head shall rebound His plotted mischiefe; and his wrongs 18His crown shal craze: But I shal sound Iehouah's praise with thankful songs, And will his glorious name expresse, And tell of all his righteousnesse. Psal. 8. As the 113. Psalme; Ye Children, &amp;c. 1 How noble is thy mighty name, O Lord o're all the worlds wide frame Whose glory is aduanc't on hye Aboue the rouling heauens rack! 2How for the gracelesse scorners sake, To still th' auenging enemy, Hast thou by tender infants tongue, The praise of thy great name made str?g, While they hang sucking on the brest. 3But when I see thine heauens bright, The Moon &amp; glittering stars of night, By thine almighty hand addrest; 4Oh! what is man, poore silly man, That thou so mind'st him, &amp; dost daine To look at his vnworthy seed! 5Thou hast him set not much beneath Thine Angels bright; &amp; with a wreath Of glory hast adorn'd his head. 6Thou hast him made by souerayne Of al thy works; &amp; stretcht his raigne 7Unto the heards, and beasts vntame, 8To foules, and to the scaly traine, That glideth through the watery main. 9How noble each-where is thy name! Psal. 9. To the tune of that knowen song, beginning; Preserue vs Lord. 1 Thee &amp; thy wondrous deeds, O God With all my soule I sound abroad 2My ioy, my triumph is in thee, Of thy drad name my song shal be, 3O highest God: since put to flight, And fall'n and vanisht at thy sight, 4Are all my foes; for thou hast past Iust sentence on my cause at last: And sitting on thy throne aboue, A rightful Iudge thy selfe do'st proue: 5The troupes profane thy checkes haue stroid And made their name for euer void. 6Where's now, my foes, your threatned wrack? So well you did our citties sack, And bring to dust; whiles that ye say, Their name shall dy as well as they. 7Lo, in eternall state God sits, And his hy throne to iustice fits: 8Whose righteous hand the world shall weeld And to al folk iust doom shal yeeld. 9The poore from hy find his reliefe, The poore in needfull times of griefe: 10Who knowes thee Lord, to thee shall cleaue, That neuer do'st thy cli?ts leaue. 11Oh! sing the God that doth abide, On Sion mount; and blazon wide 12His worthy deeds. For, he pursues The guiltlesse bloud with vengeance due: He minds their case; nor can passe o're Sad clamours of the wronged poore. 13Oh! mercy Lord; thou that do'st saue My soule from gates of death &amp; graue: Oh! see the wrong my foes haue done; 14That I thy praise, to all that gone, Through daughter Sions beautious gate With thankfull songs may loud relate; And may reioice in thy safe ayd. 15Behold: the Gentiles, whiles they made A deadly pit my soule to drowne, Into their pit are sunken downe; In that close snare they hid for mee, Lo their owne feet entangled bee. 16By this iust doom the Lord is known, That th' ill are punisht with their own. 17Down shall the wicked backward fall To deepest hell, and nations all 18That God forget; nor shall the poore Forgotten be for euermore. The constant hope of soules opprest 19Shall not ay dy. Rise from thy rest, Oh Lord, let not men base and rude Preuaile: iudge thou the multitude 20Of Lawelesse pagans: strike pale fear Into those breasts late stubborn were: And let the Gentiles feele and find, They been but men of mortall kind. Psal. 9. As the 51. Psalme; O Lord consider 1 Why st?d'st thou Lord aloof so l?g &amp; hid'st thee in due times of need 2Whiles leud men proudly offer wrong Vnto the poore? In their owne deed, And their deuise let them be caught. 3For lo, the wicked braues and boasts In his vile and outragious thought, And blesseth him that rauins most. 4On God he dares insult: his pride Scornes to inquire of powers aboue, But his stout thoughts haue stil deni'd 5Ther is a God; His waies yet proue Aye prosperous: thy iudgements hye Doe farre surmount his dimmer sight. 6Therfore doth he all foes defie: His heart saith; I shal stand in spight, Nor euer moue; nor danger 'bide. 7His mouth is fill'd with curses foule; And with close fraud: His tongue doth hide 8Mischief &amp; il: he seeks the soule Of harmlesse men in secret wait, And in the corners of the street, Doth shed their blood; with scorne and hate His eyes vpon the poore are set. 9As some fell Lyon in his den, He closely lurkes the poore to spoile, He spoiles the poore and helplesse men, When once he snares them in his toile. 10He croucheth lowe in cunning wile, And bows his brest; wheron whol thr?gs Of poor, whom his fair showes beguile, Fall to be subiect to his wrongs. 11God hath forgot, (in soule he sayes) He hides his face to neuer see. 12Lord God arise; thine hand vp-raise: Let not thy poore forgotten be. 13Shal these insulting wretches scorne Their God; and say thou wilt not care? 14Thou see'st, (for all thou hast forborn) Thou see'st what al their mischiefs are; That to thine hand of vengeance iust Thou maist th? take: the poor distressed Rely on thee with constant trust, The help of Orphans and oppressed. 15Oh! break the wickeds arme of might, And search out al their cursed trains, And let them vanish out of sight. 16The Lord as King for euer raignes. From forth his coasts, the heathen sect 17Are rooted quite: thou Lord att?dest To poore mens suites; thou doo'st direct Their harts: to th? thine eare thou b?dest; 18That thou maist rescue, fr? despight, The wofull fatherlesse, and poore: That, so, the vaine and earthen wight On vs may tyrannize no more.
