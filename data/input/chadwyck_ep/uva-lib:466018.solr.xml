      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. I sang ten years ago: I sing to-day: And through the intervening years my song Has surged round chiming shores with wavelets strong And ripples soft of many a passionate lay. Lady, whose sweet kiss through the weary way Hath helped me, lifted me when morns were long, Nights dreary,âtake these fancies as they throng, Flowerbuds that chide my hair's unlyric grey. Thou art ever with me; we can see the sun Now rising on the further side death's stream, And, perhaps, our larger half of toil is done, Our larger sorrows suffered,âand our dream Of perfect love waits burning to be won Hard by the deep dim waves that closelier gleam. August 31, 1880. THE ITALIAN ORGAN-WOMAN. O Italian organ-woman With the dark dark eyes, What quick dreams rise Within me as I watch thee! What thoughts of southern skies! In a moment, in a gasping Of the sudden glowing soul, The blue waves roll Of the Adriatic, clasping My feet; I touch the goal Of a thousand glowing fancies; The soft Italian air Breathes, and the pure dark hair, Sweet beyond all romances, Before mine eyes is fair. Oh, wonderful old seasons Of the wondrous middle age, Your passionate billows rage About meâwars and treasonsâ A strange unfathomed page. And all because the ringing Of one swift organ smote My spirit,âand afloat It went, and heard sweet singing In many a gilded boat In Italy, diviner Than is the cold sad land Wherein our chilled feet stand, Our harps swept by a minor Love-breeze, a loveless hand. O Italy, thy tender And infinite caress Is worth all stormy stress That follows, and thy splendour Makes bitterest death seem less Than one swift dream-emotion: Oh, not in England now I linger, but thought's prow Cuts through the blue clear ocean Whose waves thy rowers plough. And all because thy music, And thine Italian eyes, Sent me to bluer skies O dark-eyed organ-woman Than these that o'er us rise. ENGLAND AND PALESTINE. Not in Jerusalem Where many a tall straight stem Of august palm-tree by the way-side stands; Not in the olden town Where Christ's dear timeless crown Was woven, plaited by the Father's hands, And by the lips of those Far sweeter than the rose Kissed,âere about his brow, majestic, it expands: Not in that city fair Of sultry Eastern air Shall for our brows be crowns and garlands spun O valiant Western men, Valiant, but not as then, When, daily, deeds miraculous were done The ancient legends say; Blind eyes made whole with clay, And cures unheard of wrought beneath the Eastern sun. Oh, sweeter is the rose Here, where the North wind blows Its flawless petals, bends its pliant stem, Than Eastern lilies bright Which maidens cull by night And weave into a spotless diadem; Fairer the rich green grass Through which our swift feet pass Than the few stalks which banks of desert-streamlets hem. O South wind in the pine Of England be thou mine, Yea, mine the forests dark of Western shores, And mine the strenuous crew Of strong arms labouring through The white resurgent seas with bent quick oars; And mine the balmy lane Where honey-suckles strain Their eager tendrils,âmine the creeper round our doors. A blood-red wondrous crown Of endless high renown Was Christ's; but plait we in our love-lit vales Soft garlands sweeter far Than any wreaths that are Woven beneath the moon that Sinai pales, Or in Gethsemane, Or grown in Galilee, Where many a fisher-prow the quiet lake assails. O shores and lakes and dells Of England! asphodels And lilies of the East are not so fair As tender blossoms born Beneath the breath of morn Within your folds and nursed by Western air: Nor are the Eastern maids Crowned with the dim black braids As sweet as flowing crowns of sun-kissed golden hair. O England! cliffs and downs And bustling fervent towns And long grey shores and myriad-manÃ¨d sea, And gardens, close, red-walled, And mountains weird and bald And white-plumed torrents tossing o'er the lea And green sequestered nooks And pebbly trout-loved brooksâ Give all your glory of soul, ye wild domains, to me! Crown me not with a hand Burnt red with sultry sand, But with the clear palm of an English maid; Stars that above us shine, O'er mountain-ash and pine, And fluctuant birch and tangled oak-tree's shade And silvery mute stream, Mix ye with my fond dream,â And flowers that flush in spring the English mossy glade. And English women fair, Sweet for the Northern air, Breathed as the English rose and white as high Lilies that round us stand, Stretch forth from all the land Hands lily-white and fragrant ere I die, And crown the English song That sweeps in tide-flood strong Across my eager heart and through my soul doth sigh. Oh, never yet avail Our songs that seek the pale And sun-burnt maidens of the Eastern land; That leave the land of pines For weak low-growing vines: Never avail the feet that feebly stand Upon our sounding shores: Never avail the oars That shun the utter deep, that strike against the sand. Grant me the perfect kiss Of England,âgive me this, O time, O life, O death with down-bowed wings! I ask this; nothing more: One swift scent of the shore That the blue endless English ocean rings With ring of sweet white foam; One rosebud from my home, One flower whereto my hand in the death-grapple clings. One rustling heather-bell, One tuft of furze to smell, One woman's mouth, dearer than rose, to kiss; One vision, nothing more, Of limitless wide shore; One awful rush of music; only this: One breath of the utter sky Of England;âthen I die Content, clasped in a wild unfathomable bliss. One wondrous London day, To watch the torrent play, The flood of life, along the murmuring shore Of endless seething streets; One with the heart that beats In giant pulses through them evermore: Then let the veil be rent And let me pass content The ever-rippling, waiting, yearning, death-stream o'er. Crowned with my own sweet land, Her hand within my hand, Her eyes upon my eyes, her tender gaze Deeply intent on me, And all her wind-sweet sea Laughing as children laugh in primrose-ways; Thus would I pass,ânor fear Lest in a new land drear I pass beyond the reach of love and flowers and bays. Where God is, children are, And sweet love, and the star Of labour and of hope,âand woman's tread; Woman whose tender breath Fills all the vales of death Like the far miles of countless rose-scent shed In the Caucasian vales: Such death no spirit pales, For where there lasts a rose, no death-pale soul is dead. Where love is, death is not; Yea, not o'er any spot Where sweet love treads hath bitter death the power Not over England's seas, Nor the immortal breeze, Nor one white pure imperishable flower Of English womanhood, Nor one true bard who stood True to his love and land through life's fast-flitting hour. A HYMN. [Than woman's grace more infinitely tender] Than woman's grace more infinitely tender, Crowned with the wide sky's uttermost deep splendour, God-like and woman-like, friend to each offender, Sweet Mother, hear us! Strong as the strong seas, gentle as the falling Snowflakes of winter, hearken to our calling: Rend thou our foes' ranks, our advance inwalling; Great Father, cheer us! Ruler of the four winds, Maker of the roses, Sweetness of thine each petal-cup discloses; Thine all the wealth sweet utmost summer shows is; Sweet Mother, hear us! Strong in the blast of the North wind's anger, Chider of nations, eager-footed ranger Threading the stars' ways victor over danger, Great Father, cheer us! Softer than woman-heart, Healer of the weary, Sending calm sleep down, winged, upon the dreary Children of men when sorrow waileth, eerie; Sweet Mother, hear us! God of the war-ranks, flushed with the charges, When the red bolts reel, blunted on the targes, When the red foot-prints brighten river-marges, Great Father, cheer us! Send us a flower, God,âsend us we pray thee, Breath of thine heaven-land, seeking to-day thee! Lo! with our clasped hands, God, we delay thee! Sweet Mother, hear us! Lift us through high seas of our tribulation Ever from high towards holier higher station: Heal every sad soul, renovate each nation: Great Father, hear us! TO âSOMEBODYâ. I Not in joy thou camest Filling with delight Where love's shafts thou aimest All the pathway bright, Crowned with a buoyant wreath of blossoms from the height. II Not like common flowers Gorgeous in array Were the buds thy bowers Cloistered from the way: Blossoms were thine of sorrow, not of gaudy day. III White thy buds and tender In soft beauty were, Not of fierce red splendour Flushing all the air With the august rich bloom their fiery tendrils bear. IV Red with fierce pain only, Streaked with love's own blood, Telling of the lonely Tides of sorrow's flood, Is thy spirit's clear bloom, every gentle bud. V Every path thou makest, Spirit dear, divine: Lo! as dawn thou breakest On this spirit of mine Made by thine own grief-pang, ever and ever thine. VI Thou art in the sunset, Thou art in the sky, In the white clear onset Of the waves that try To climb the sheer shore, surging ever yet more high. VII In the honeysuckle, Lady, is thy breast: Dimpled dear white knuckle, Is a lily dressed Sweetlier e'er than thou art, in a snowier vest? VIII Thou art in the roses, Yea, each perfect bloom Thine own heart discloses, Thine heart-deep perfume: Victor, O flower triumphant, thou art o'er the tomb! IX Thou art in all Nature, Lady, unto me: In her every feature; In the wide wide sea, In the soft leaf-laughter of a wind-kissed tree. X In the pure tide-laughter On the silver sands; In the ripples, after, Hunting with moist hands For the receding tide-wave, ebbing o'er the strands. XI In the ripple-surging Of all mountain-lakes; In the swift winds urging Bushes in bent brakes; In all that world-wide gladness, world-wide movement, makes. XII In the orange lily, In the white as well: In the blue land hilly: In the soft furze-smell: In all divine delights of Nature thou dost dwell. XIII At thy golden coming, Doth not sorrow flee? Summer and the humming Of the banded bee And laughter of all Nature do environ thee. XIV When thy dark eyes meet me, How can trouble stay? When thy touch doth greet me, All is bright as day: The sun shines forth, and splendid is his golden ray. XV Whether it be London Or the country side, Straightway grief is undone, For I know my bride, Alert, white-hearted, splendid, beautiful, swift-eyed. XVI Swift dark eyes of wonder How doth passion fill Your sweet depths, and sunder By its regal will All that the separate hours between did work of ill! XVII Common fields are glorious When thy step is near: Seasons slow, laborious, Shine forth swift and dear; Thou bringest every blessing by thy coming here. XVIII Lo! for thee the ocean Soundeth on the shore, Its profound emotion Pouring evermore Forth at thy feet which love it; thee doth it adore. XIX Sweet, thy spirit is gifted Far beyond the crowd: Gentle, not uplifted Be thou: calm, not proud: Tender of voice and queenly,âlonely, God-endowed. XX Surely on some morrow We shall rise and flee This dim earth, and borrow Pinions of the free, And cleave the quiet blue superb airs joyfully. XXI Surely all our longing And our suffering known To the high God, thronging, Winged, around his throne, Some day shall bring his blessing on us, for our own. XXII Have we not, sweet, waited, Through the sighing years? Gazed through barriers grated? Wetted with our tears The lonely sands of life-time: what relief appears? XXIII Lo! the great sweet vision Death brings and his handâ One day for our prison Blue sky shall expand And sweet love's perfect summer roseflush all the land. XXIV Then the tender rose-flush On thy cheek shall be: As it burns and glows, flush Likewise leagues of sea: And sunrise beams resplendent, flames in every tree. XXV Then we will not tarry; Dead will be all wrong; God our souls shall marry, Married in my song Long ere we fled the earth, vast-pinioned angels strong. XXVI For in song possessing All thy sweet sweet soul, Music fond, caressing, Doth around thee roll Great waves of passion now, long ere we touch the goal. XXVII But one day at sweeping Rush of God's swift hand All the love that, sleeping, Charmed the sleeping land Shall awake: awake, shall waft to heaven's strand. XXVIII One hour doth the sorrow, But one hour, endure: Then the burning morrow And the awful pure Unutterable joy that God's heart maketh sure. XXIX The awful spirit-sunrise Over land and sea: Sweeter than love's moonrise Which on you and me Even in life shines soft,âyea, kinglier that shall be. XXX Sunrise that shall follow Agony that slays, Blue hill and green hollow And the deep flower-ways Filling with urgent life, and our hushed hearts with praise. TO MY LADY. A BALLAD. Wonderful naked neck, Marble, pure, beyond fleck. Wonderful sea-deep eyes, Splendid as waves or skies. Wonderful arms and hands, Wonderful soft hair-bands. Wonderful body, too sweet For bodies of gods to greet. Wonderful lips, divine With savour of eglantine. From what wonderful land Camest thou, girl-form grand? Rising as Venus rose From white waves, whiter than snows. Coming as Venus came To set the world aflame. Love, where art thou now, Tender, noble of brow? What flowers in what land Have caressed thine hand? Dost thou dream of me, Dream of our old sweet sea? Dream of the love-sweet dell, Where our footsteps fell? Dream of the words I spoke When love the silence broke? Dream of the deep green valleys Whence the soft breeze sallies, Laden with odours fair That soften the summer air? Dost thou dream of the days When, ardent with new-born lays, I flung at thy dear feet Many a song-flower sweet? Splendid as Dante's queen (She too was fifteen When he first beheld Her figure and love forth-welled)â Splendid as Dante's bride Thou wast, by the green cliff-side Standing, lithe, upright, Youth's wonderful one sweet sight. Now thou art no more A glory on that far shore. The inland woods have heard Thy laughter, O love-voiced bird! And inland flowers have seen The seawind-kissed fair queen. Art thou content with flowers That blossom within thy bowers? Dost thou not yearn for the sea? Dost thou dream never of me? Oh, wonderful body and hands, Who kisseth the brown hair-bands? Who kisseth body and hair And breast-flowers soft and rare? Hath he wonderful tender hands To gladden the brown hair-bands? Hath he subtle and gentle touch To fondle the dear neck much? Hath he voice of the old sweet sea? Hath he love and lyre of me? Hath he spirit as fierce as mine, And passion as sparkling wine, And love as the old white flowers That scented our woods for hours? Take this one far word: Let the sound of my song be heard Where thou art sitting to-day,â Look up, sweet,âhearken, I pray. Give me thy wonderful hand, And enter the long-lost land. Enter the woods one night, A spirit, a wonder white. Or I will wait for thee By the old unaltered sea. Give me a kiss and cling About me, O soft of wing! Touch me with every nerve: With wonderful bend and curve Of wonderful supple form, Womanly, eager, warm, Earnest, swift, on fire, Satiate my desire. Lean and throb to me Like music of the sea. Be body and neck and face, Mixed in a wild embrace Awful, entire, supreme, Great as a great God's dream. Give me thine utter soul, Thy spirit, thine heart,âthe whole. Be compliant and pure; With rapture of clasp secure My neck in thine eager hands, And smother with loose hair-bands (That fluctuate over me, So that their night I see Alone, and nought beside Save star-eyes of my bride) My face, and pour thy splendour Great, terrible, burning, tender, Throughout me: like all flowers That ever filled earth's bowers; Or like the rush of a stream, Or music's manifold dream. Like one multiform flower, My body and soul imbower,â One woman-blossom, giving Joy utter, abundant, living; Joy beyond all speech, That song's words cannot reach, Joy that quivers along The body in throbs of song, And through the soul in leaps That stir the soul's dim deepsâ Wonderful body divine, Flower-body, be thou mine; Flower-lips, rose-mouth, kiss, cling,â White arms, be tense white ring My body to embrace: And, wonderful woman-face, Thy spirit through thine eyes Mingle, with dear low sighs Of utter joy, with me: Woman, my woman be. A HYMN OF WOMAN. Is there one summer night Wherein thou art not white, O Woman diviner than all summer airs? Is there one tender rose Without thy mouth that glows Within the central crown the rosebud bears? Each meadow of corn thy golden beauty wears. The dreams of youth are thine, The buds upon the vine, The splendour of noonday and of quiet night: Thy sacred locks of gold Round lovers thou dost fold, And in the utter stars thine eyes are bright; Radiant thou shinest upon the mountain-height. What glory can we see Of passion without thee O dark-eyed queen of passion and of pure Delight that makes all things Thrill to the sound of wings, Start at the gleam of some celestial lure; Within thine hand thou dost all flowers secure. Thine hair is black as night Sometimes, or golden-bright As every shade of slowly-ripening corn; Or English simple brown Soft locks thou hast for crown, And breast whose subtle sweet scents put to scorn Blossoms whose dew-kissed petals kiss the morn. Whether in youth we dream Or days of manhood teem With urgent labour, lady, thou art there In love the world to drape; No mortal may escape The sweet bewildering tangle of thine hair; With the increasing years thou growest more fair. Thou art a sacred queen To boyish rapt sixteen, But never the flying days may fly from thee; Thou broodest as of old Above the tossed broad gold Of sunset and of sundawn on the sea, And o'er the wind-tossed grass-blades of the lea. Ever thou art, love, there,â The wind-wave of thine hair, And all thy splendour of bloom, and thy white hands; Yea, thy pure body white Is our sweet moon of night, Amazing and enthralling all the lands With ever sweeter tenure of pure bands. Sweet, ardent, swift of gaze, Upon the flower-hung ways Of earliest youth thou treadest like a queen; But when the soft flowers fall Thou art still over all, Abiding with the same old smile serene Untouched amid the autumnal dim demesne. For autumn unto thee Is but as spring; we see No diminution in thy glory, O thou For whom the roses wear Their garb of fragrant air, For whom the lilies bend imperial brow; For whom the autumnal breezes whisper now. Not ever a rosebud falls Within grey trellised walls But for its falling do the great gods grieve; But thou beyond all grief, Untouched, unsere of leaf, Regnant, the immortal high land dost achieve, And bloomest deathless from life's morn till eve. Beyond all seas and showers, Beyond all earthly hours, Unconquered and immortal, sweet, thou art: The utter dreamful skies Thrill to thy tender eyes; The moonbeams and the sunbeams watch thine heart; Through the blue moonlit heavens thy swift feet dart. Thou art not any flower Of earthly passing bower, But sweet and glorious as from God's own hand: Thou fillest all the breeze And the far laughing seas And all the green recesses of the land With rose-breath, as when countless flowers expand. In history's far weird days Thou didst thy banner raise Unchanged; thou wast to races vanished long The same unearthly queen Of majesty serene, With sceptre sweet and so with sceptre strong; A poem in Greece or Rome, a Syrian song. By rivers echoing far 'Neath dead and broken star, 'Neath planets fallen themselves now in the void, Thou wast a flower new-born With all the flush of morn Upon the cheeks whose tender flush decoyed, And sweetness in the white hands which destroyed. Thou ravelledst hearts of men As even now, so then,â Thou tangledst strong men's spirits in a snare: Thou gavest unto them Sweet passion's diadem,â To kiss thy bosom and to kiss thine hair,â To know thee longed-for and to find thee fair. Through the ages thou hast been The same white endless queen, Filling the vales with music and the sky With wonderful pure light, And all our hearts with might,â Soothing with gentle laughter every sigh, Bringing the bounty of farthest heaven more nigh. What thou wast in the day When on the water-way Flamed the bright galley of the Egyptian queen, Thou art, white sweetheart, still; Late ages thou dost thrill, And thou didst gladden all the years between; Fostering, above earth's gardens thou dost lean. Intenser is the rose Of passion when it blows In later manhood,âand the growing race, Woman, find fairer things Soft-gathered in thy wings And tenderer hues of beauty in thy face Than all thy far ancestral rumoured grace. So, lady, left so long Beside the sea-waves strong, Intenser ever is the love I bear Unto thy dear grey eyes Coloured as Northern skies And all the endless garland of thine hair, And body white and wonderful and fair. No day can pass but brings Sound sweeter of thy wings, And tenderer echo of approaching feet: Thou canst not flee away; Is even sombre and grey? Flush it with sunrise of thy coming, sweet, And at thy voice bid all the old mists retreat! REMEMBER ME. As thou dost through far flying vales retreat With soft breath than the wind-kissed rose more sweet, Remember me! Remember me when sunset through the panes Gleams,âwhen the burning gold of sunrise reigns Above the sea. When all the woods in June with laughing birds Are loud, remember love's old June-sweet words, Love's summer glee. As thou dost hold thy new love by the hand, Remember, lady, all the old flowerful land, Remember me! When days are dreary now, and lips are cold, And no sweet singer at thy gate is bold, Think on the sea. Think how the old waves sang louder for my song, How sweet the moonlit beach was, and the strong Lyre of love's glee. By all the old summer days and woods divine That leapt at lovers' footsteps, yours and mine, Remember me! By silent sorrowing in thy swift retreat Think, if the rills be tender, how more sweet The open sea. Think, if the buds that smile for thee inland Be gracious, were it not more grace to stand Alone with me? Far out of sight of common haunts and ways, Tender as in the old tender-eyed sweet days Beside the sea; The days which closed in sacred wondrous tune Of mystic first love 'neath the mystic moon, In marvellous glee; Were it not passing sweet again to stand, Lips touching sweet lips, strong hand touching hand,â Remember me. HYMN. By thy perfect sea, Lord deliver me! By thy strength of hand Over sea and land, Over hills and plains; By thy love that reigns: By thy stars and storms, By thy sun that warms: By thy snow that shields Seeds and fallow fields: By thy breath that speaks In the sweet spring-weeks: By the summer rose, Where thy beauty glows: By thy tenderness, By thy soft caress: By thine outspread wings, Wherethrough thunder sings: By thy glories poured Over mount and sward: By thy wondrous might, Shown in starry night: By thy mountain-lakes, By thy white snow-flakes: By thy lonely seas, By thy rosefed breeze: By thy rains and clouds, By thy white mist-shrouds: By thy heaven of blue, Which thy love smiles through: By thy tender heart, By thy lightning dart: By thy wondrous world In thy love-robe furled: By thy majesty, God, deliver me! SONG. THE FUTURE. The blue sky gleams, The old dead dreams Vanish adown the air: From tree and bower, From grass and flower, Comes message of morning fair Again the rose In England glows, Again the sweet streams sound: The woods are white With buds' delight, Anemones star the ground. The utter sky Gleams pure and high And the old moon thrills the vales: Once more for free Souls sounds the sea, And the outspread wide wind's sails. Far, far behind, We leave the blind Deaf souls who love the past; The future's deep Voice thrills our sleep, Its mantle upon us is cast. The green meads sing, Alert of wing The future's songsters fly On sweet white pinions O'er broad dominions Of wonderful untouched sky. E'en love is new And sweet of hue, Flushed as the first spring rose, And passion gleams, Soft-draped in dreams, And the blossom of soul-life blows. DESDEMONA RE-AWAKENED. Desdemona is alive! The strange sweet head Shines, is not dead: We are re-wed. The green fields laugh; The blue waves gleam; Death was a dream; O sweet sun-beam! My woman smiles; O same eyes still I strove to kill, Have ye your will! My love is here; O dear same hands, What love expands In heaven's new lands! Or is it earth? The earth new-born With flush of morn On bright brow worn. O love! love! love! I slew my soul With youâthe whole: Death was the goal. O soft-haired head! O eyes of light And bosom white And shoulder bright! O body and soul! Body so sweet And soul so meet; Lo! doubt's defeat! TO THE REV. STOPFORD A. BROOKE, ON HIS LEAVING THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND. Now where the high hills are And all the airs with mountain flowers are sweet, Tread thou; the valleys yearn not for thy feet: Their wreathed mists bar Thy vision, in prison, from risen great gold star. Now where the strong streams run Seek thou with ever more familiar tread The utmost summits where the sun burns red, The strong free sun, And where in air most fair God's crowns are won. The crowns of victors strong, O'er pain, o'er doubt, o'er loneliness, o'er death, Who have traversed life's lone sea with fearless breath; But now they long, Yearn, each, in speech to reach the victors' song. For the utmost tenderness Of spirit is all the hope man can bestow: To win from his own soul its utmost glow,â So to redress Some pain and strain, and gain love's white caress. The awful utter love Is the only gift we care for now,âto hold Within our souls God's soul and this unfold: All mere creeds move Fast on the blast, are passed,âthis dwells above. Beyond all earthly creeds Thou passest now to the utmost peak, O friend, Where in love's vision all our visions blend: Each soul that bleeds High to this sky with sigh at length succeeds. With deep sigh of relief,â Watching at last the unimprisoned stars Now face to face and not through Church-forged bars: Sweet even if brief The hour when power doth shower from sun to sheaf. The one gold autumn hour Whose glory compensates for all the year Of mingled pain and labour and swift fear; When thought to flower Springs, and the autumnal woodbine rings life's bower. To pour our souls away In utter selfless love; this joy alone Sets the divine sweet soul on God's pure throne: This in our day We yearn and burn to compass, as we may. August 22, 1880. TO THE GREATER WOMAN. O greater woman with the great sweet hands, Queen of all flowers and loves in all sweet lands, When lonely, in weird pain, my spirit stands, O great love, hear me! When loves of earth are feeble and forsake, Thou Woman-God, my worn-out spirit take, Renew, deliver; soften and re-make; Great God, be near me! Heal me with wonder of thine awful kiss: If earth's friends fail, and ever earthly bliss Declines, O God thy beautyâleave me this! Thy breath to cheer me! O queenlier woman with the loving breast So white, so tender, soothe me, give me rest; If all are frail, in thee my soul is blest; O white love, save me! O whiter woman with the rose-sweet hair Than all the abundant tresses yet more fair Which the dear brows of earthly women wear, Lift from the grave me! I mix my heart with thine: with awful cry I turn me theeward from the loves that lie; I trust thee, seek thee, praise thee as I die, For thou shalt save me! Are they flower-soft? then art thou softer yet And tenderer: on thy brow more high calm set; Oh, let my face by thy swift face be met, O woman, hold me! In arms that never open to let fall, In breast wherethrough no withering serpents crawl, In hands that close in like a sweet safe wall, O sweet God, fold me! O greater heavenlier woman than all these, With breath more tender than the tenderest breeze That shakes in Italy the moonlit trees, To thy will mould me! DESOLATION. With tenderest touch of mystical sweet hands And fragrant overflow of soft hair-bands She made me laughing lord of all love's lands. She raised me upward towards love's eagle height By tenderest touching of her bosom white And by her sweet deep brown eyes' laughing light. She kissed me on the mouth, a kiss supreme Of a soft rose far softer than a dream, And gave me heaven and God in one swift gleam. She left me, mocked me,âand this earth was hell, With never air to breathe, no flower to smell; Lo! as she went, God, spear-pierced, tottering, fell. ALONE. Alone upon the scentless earth I stand; Alone: Far barren fields stretch wide on either hand, Wind-blown. Not one dear flower of woman's heart is left For me: Not one grass-blade in rocky rainless cleft I see. Only the awful waste of billows white And strong: Only the starless soundless boundless night,â No song. Only the Godless speechless heavens,âno sound On land or sea: No help, no hope, no heart, no haven found For me. SWEETER. Lilies are sweet, but sweeter is thy breast Whereon our tired hearts fall and therein rest, O lady; Its calm is than the utmost calm more blest Of valleys shady! The rose is sweet, but sweeter is thy mouth Than all the roses gladdening all the south With fragrant splendour; Where thou art, ne'er for e'er is passion's drouth O woman tender! May-bloom is white, but whiter are thine hands Than all May-blossoms smiling in spring-lands, O spotless woman: Where thou art, every gentle flower expands Of sweet love human! The night is sweet, but sweeter sweeter far In thy soft arms the dreams imprisoned are; Far sweeter, sweeter: Thy swift glance thrills the darkness like a star, A sudden meteor! Dreaming in June beside a river-shore Is sweet, but oh with thee through dreams to soar To love's low measure Is sweeter, sweeter, exquisite far more,â A nobler pleasure! The sweet wind's kissing mouth is dear delight, But oh thy sacred kiss that crowns the night, Than breeze more pleasant: And oh thy body than all flowers more white, Joy omnipresent! ENGLISH FLOWERS AND SEAS. In the land of breezy cliff-tops and blown grasses, O Christ, art thou? Where the summer-wind through crimson clover passes, Do blossoms bow? Do the tender roses in the green June hedges Before thee burn? Do the rushes tall along our river-edges To thy face turn? Do the lilies white their fragrant stems before thee, O Christ-king, bend? Do English woods and English hills adore thee And greeting send? Is English honeysuckle glad to ring thee, Thy fair brown head? Do watchful hands of English women bring thee Soft roses red? Do English maidens open hearts and bosoms For thee to see? Art thou the lord who gathereth English blossoms From plant and tree? Are English women's spirits tearful, tender, When thou art near? Trembling do they unveil for thee their splendour With woman's fear? Art thou the lord of many a soft heart beating With love of thee? Art thou the prince of wide waste waves retreating. Our white fierce sea? Art thou the ruler of the autumn glory Of dell and vale? Do women, woods, and golden leaves, and hoary Waves, shout âAll-hailâ? Nay: Beauty's self upon our rocky ledges Is sole sweet queen; She, rose of roses in our rose-sweet hedges, Shines in the green. She, 'mid the wavelets white a woman whiter, Rises to stand Upon our storm-swept cliffs a sweet star brighter Than thy bright hand. Our blossoms and our women bend before her, Her face they seek: Our mountain-winds and moutain-mists adore her; For her they speak. Our maidens not for thee O Christ are tender,â Oh, not for thee: But English eyes their unapproached white splendour Sometimes may see. The eternal seas on iron shore-sides breaking For our ears sound: The summer winds the moon-lit aspens shaking Love Northern ground. The courser-waves along the gold sands charging Not in thy name Spread wide white manes along the yellow margin Of beach they claim. Yea, not for thee a maiden's rose-like passion Bloomed in the North: Not towards thy lips in mystical low fashion Words trembled forth. Not for all wreaths wherewith the lands imbower thee, Would I displace My one white rose,ânor hand, O perfect flower, thee To Christ's embrace. VOICES. Prologue. CHRIST. Lo! o'er the wide green waves is thy sun setting, Thy sun that flamed throughout the centuries long With rays so vehement of point and strong? Will it be lost to sight beyond regretting In the green waves that surge around it, fretting Its red fierce disc with floods of mocking song? Do new sweet moons and stars the blue night throng? Will there be suns for homage and forgetting? We loved Christ's rose of blood till, tenderer far, The rose of Beauty flamed, a silver star, Flower-sweet, flower-tranquil, o'er the lessening foam: Then saw we in the depths within her eyes The end of our eternity of sighs, Peace and a haven of hope, a painless home. CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN ELDERS. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Hearken: the Christ-king stands With tender and outstretched hands; He bringeth a law to the lands, Glad tidings to every shore. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Flag of the Christ-king, rise Blood-red in the blue clear skies: Lead us, through sorrow and sighs, Through tears and pangs of the war. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Bend we before our King And banners of greeting bring; With swift sure ecstasy sing, With down-bent homage adore. CHORUS OF GREEK MAIDENS. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Hearken: our Lady is fair As a rose in the morning air, Sent from on high to prepare Sweet tidings for every shore. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Beauty of Venus our queen In front of us flame and be seen; Lo! whiter than water the sheen Of her body, our token of war. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Wonderful Goddess, thee Sprung white from the foam of the sea, On gladsome and bended knee We worship and hymn and adore. CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN ELDERS. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Heal us, O Christ; our sighs To the innermost cloudland rise: Wipe thou the tears from our eyes, From eyes that are weary and sore. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Never was heart so pure As thine, Christ; thou shalt endure For ever: thy throne is sure, Yea, firmer than any before. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Bountiful Christ! oh stand With sword and sceptre in hand: Thou art prince, thou art king to command, Thou art God's own Son from of yore. CHORUS OF GREEK MAIDENS. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Wipe thou our weeping with hair Outpoured, sweet, smelling of air Of tenderest June-night, rare Sweet bounty for souls that are sore. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Never were roses as white, O Goddess, as thy breast bright: Tender as moon in the night It gleams thy people before. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Beautiful rose-sweet maid, 'Neath the olives, in glimmering shade, Thou standest, nude, unafraid, A snow-white queen from of yore. CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN ELDERS. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Bend upon us thy face, Thy bounty, thy beauty, thy grace,â Be our goal in the wearisome race,â The balm of thy spirit outpour. Christ being raised, dieth no more! By thy groans upon Calvary's tree, Blood-drops like tides of a sea, Redeem thou the world unto thee; By the oath thy Father swore. Christ being raised, dieth no more! To the farthest bounds of the land Far stretches his strong right hand; As a lion o'er leagues of sand He paces, and loud is his roar. CHORUS OF GREEK MAIDENS. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Sweet, with the balm of thy breath Deliver from shadow of death; O'er mountain, valley, and heath, Thy blessing and help outpour. Christ being dead, liveth no more! By thine own dear calm white hands, Calm love, deliver the lands From shackles and perilous bands; Christ never thy sweet oath swore. Christ being dead, liveth no more! To the furthest limits of sight Soft reaches our love's hand white; Little she cares for the might Of Jesus, his lion-like roar. CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN ELDERS. Christ being raised, dieth no more! All the heavens of gold In his sure grasp Christ doth hold; He stands, keen, stalwart and bold, Alert at the heavenly door. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Help us, O Christ, to rise To the loftiest untouched skies: Hear thou our groans and sighs; Aid us to heaven to soar. Christ being raised, dieth no more! He walked on the waves of the lake Which a glistering floor did make: Not a ripple had force to shake His foot till his march was o'er. CHORUS OF GREEK MAIDENS. Christ being dead, liveth no more! All the heavens of blue Her clear gaze glimmereth through; Her soft tears fall in the dew; She guardeth the high morn's door. Christ being dead, liveth no more! The sweet and the tender seas And the loving and gentle breeze Are thine, O Venus; with these For wings thy soul doth soar. Christ being dead, liveth no more! And Love in the blue seas shines As they wander in sparkling lines; Never her grace declines, Never her sceptre is o'er. CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN ELDERS. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Surely where thou dost stand Are flowers and songs of the land; Summer at thy right hand Shines on the green earth-floor. Christ being raised, dieth no more! What was the raiment thou Didst wear, Christ? crucified how Was thy body and pierced thy brow! Thy shoulders a red robe wore! Christ being raised, dieth no more! Sweet are thy lips and face,â FulfillÃ¨d of fair pure grace; On the steps of thy shrine we place Rich fruits ripe to the core. CHORUS OF GREEK MAIDENS. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Surely within thy breast All buds of summer time rest As in soft and scented nest; Thou clothest the sweet earth-floor. Christ being dead, liveth no more! White is thy body, O Queen; Its tender adorable sheen O'er the moonlit waves is seen: Thy shoulders their loveliness wore! Christ being dead, liveth no more! And we bring roses and fair Wreaths tenderly wrought prepare: Berries in thy black hair We twist, red-ripe to the core. CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN ELDERS. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Gifts in thine heaven, O King, Thou hast for the hearts who sing At thine altar, and round thee cling; Gifts from thine heavenly store. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Flies as a flag to the front Christ's war-plume; there in the brunt Of the battle he foes doth hunt,â Yet the people his prowess ignore. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Never shall frost again Defile the grass of the plain; Never shall fierce snows stain The wide fields frozen and hoar. CHORUS OF GREEK MAIDENS. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Thou art the only flower We care for now in thy bower: Thine own scent, sweet one, shower Upon us, its fragrant store. Christ being dead, liveth no more! On the sweet wind exquisite sighs From our musical love-land rise; Beauty a bird in the skies Sings,âyet her song they ignore. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Now the roses blow For the waste wide miles of snow; Singing is with us for woe; Grass for the dead plains hoar. CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN ELDERS. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Four Evangelists came, Robed in raiment of flame, Eager with passionate aim, Christ's stern warriors four. Christ being raised, dieth no more! Christ the whole earth planned: It leaped new-born from his hand; His Spirit the waste void fanned With its breath, and swift life bore. CHORUS OF GREEK MAIDENS. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Beauty's messengers fair Are fire and ocean and air, And the green earth clothed in rare Flower-raiment: ministers four. Christ being dead, liveth no more! Beauty the whole earth made; The sunlit lands and the shade; Mountain and valley and glade; Life as a babe She bore. Epilogue. BEAUTY. Yea, thou art whiter than the Christ, O tender Venus who risest from the waves of time With the old form beyond all words sublime; As forest air when the night-mists surrender And flowers are touched by sun, O stainless splendour Thy breath is sweet: thou dwellest in a clime Of love and lyric harmony and rhyme, Far from the foot of slow-eyed foul offender. Take thou the future; in thy passionate kiss Is all we need of earthly, heavenly bliss: O body of beauty, all thy wealth bestow! Like freshest smell of ferns in fragrant lanes Is the dear scent that trembles o'er thy veins, And sweeter is thy mouth than man can know. CHRIST AND VENUS. Across the weary waste of billowy water, From heaven's high shore, Comes Christ's voice saying, âO son, O weary daughter, Thy toil is o'erâ. Across the moonlit meads, where tremulous willows Bend dappled arms; Across the bright sea's sunlit laughing billows, Shine Venus' charms. But hearken not: think of the skies so golden, The seas so sweet, The glory of him who trod the lake-waves olden With unharmed feet. But we are weary,âand love's white limbs are shining The soft night through; What fellowship have we, O spirits repining At love, with you? Hark to the solemn voice of Jesus saying, âSoon will the door On souls unsound and feeble feet delaying Close evermoreâ. Hark to the gracious voice of Venus chiding The slow-foot crew; Her rose-sweet breasts amid the roses hiding Tarry for you. And you may win the immortal peace that faileth Never indeed: Believe in Christ; mark how the pierced brow paleth, The torn feet bleed! Mark how the flowers faint back for very wonder When Venus speaks: The tints that flame behind the mountains yonder Are in her cheeks. After life's battle, lo! the towers of marble; The sweet high song That seraphs in God's golden palace warble, White-plumed and strong. After the weary day the sweet flushed night-time, And waiting there, Giver of every summer-soft delight-time, Our goddess fair. After the lusts of earth the pure dominions Where Christ is seen Cleaving the solemn air with gold vast pinions Of awful sheen. And after this the scent among the mountains Of Venus' locks: Sound of her footstep tender amid the fountains And moss-gay rocks. After the heat of earth the cool high heaven Where no lusts dwell: Lifted we are, yea saved, we sinners, even From flames of hell. Lifted we are by the divine dear brightness Of Venus' breast: Yea, by the body's soft exceeding whiteness Our lips caressed. Jesus! from all foul thoughts and shapes deliver! From all base dreams! Their goddess pierce with darts from out thy quiver; With sword that gleams! Hurtless art thou and harmless, sweetheart tender,â Christ's arrows fail; For thine invulnerable naked splendour, Nude, needs no mail. SLEEP. When the wild days, love, Pass, and night's haze, love, For the sun's blaze, love, Falls o'er the land; How we shall sleep, love, Tenderly weep, love, Passion-joy reap, love, Glad hand in hand! How we shall kiss, love, Pleasure we miss, love, Into one bliss, love, Swift-gathered then; How we shall cling, love, While our souls sing, love, While passion's wing, love, Guards us again. Now the days dreary Groan, and the eerie Frozen nights weary Body and heart; Yea, not a pleasure Breaks our sad leisure; Sick beyond measure Sigh we apart. Oh, when together How the old tether Bursts, and blue weather Laughs in the breeze! How the old sadness Fades, and our gladness Mounts up to madness, Thrilleth the trees! How we are lifted, Blessed now and gifted, We who were drifted Far out to sea; Now thy heart waketh, Sweet one, that breaketh, Trembleth and acheth, Lost without me! I too am waking, Draught of joy taking, Eager lips slaking In the pure wine; Wine that thou givest, Love, while thou livestâ As thou receivest Strength-gifts of mine. Ah! when our sorrow Flies on the morrow, How we shall borrow Pinions to fly: How we shall soar, love, Bursting the door, love, Slavery o'er, love; Free, you and I! When we meet next, love, Joy for our text, love, Tired not nor vext, love, How we shall weep: One day forsaking Earth and its aching, Prison-bars breaking, How we shall sleep! TO THE AUTHOR OF âTHE PRINCE'S QUEST AND OTHER POEMSâ. Wouldst thou join, O brother, The swift-winged poet-throng? Wouldst thou tread the burning Paths where singers, yearning Onward, upward turning, Jostle one another, The mountain-airs among? Oh, thy soul is young yet, Crowned with sweet youth's leaves; Thou hast not been maddened By neglect, and saddened By lost love,âbut gladdened All thy soul hath sung,âyet Fate thy future weaves. Joy thou shalt have, singer; Not all song is pain: Hearts of women sweeter Than thine own soft metre, Than thy swift words fleeter, Shall for thy sake linger,â Hearken to thy strain. Many a sunset waits thee, Many a summer day; Many a bower of roses Where Venus' breast reposes And all its wealth discloses; Time not yet, friend, hates thee; Thou art early in the way. Many a friend shall find thee, Many a friend forsake; Many a love with tender Show of white soft splendour Shall for thee surrender; Many a bright noon blind thee, Many a morning break. Many seas with billows Green or blue or grey Shall for thee their roaring Music be forth-pouring: Many birds be soaring Through the oaks and willows Where thy footsteps stray. So thy life shall forward Push its lingering wave; Till the stars less golden Seem than in the olden Sweet days mist-enfolden; Till thou lookest shoreward, Poet, at thy grave. See that ere thou sinkest, Some true work be done: Ere the rose-leaves wither Seek to lure fame hither; With thy lyre and zither Light what life thou drinkest Ere the set of sun. One true song is endless, One sweet hymn supreme: Chant but one true tender Song, and its winged splendour Back to thee shall render, Yea, though life be friendless, Joy deeper than thy dream. TO VENUS. An experiment in rhyme. Wonderful exquisite bowers of the flowers of the passions, Tender the splendour ye render in marvellous fashions: Bright the delight of your white to our eyesight Thalassians. Sweet are thy feet that retreat being fleet through the posies, Venus, that lover-like cover like myriads of roses The ways and the bays and the sprays where thy body reposes. Wonder of thunder can sunder and sever from thee Never a mortal: immortal thy portal of sea Gleameth and beameth and streameth with laughter and glee. Flower-like and bower-like, roseshower-like, we pray thee to save, Venus, our soul from the goal and the roll of the wave Swirling and curling and whirling us fast to the grave. By thy body most beautiful, dutiful, now we beseech Heal us and save: by thine hair and sweet air of the beach Whence thou risest sublime to our clime, give us time, room and reach. Give our rhyme, Venus, time and sublime it till worthy it be Of thy face and thy grace and the place where we tarry for thee, Where the sound without bound now is found of thy limitless sea. With mouth like the South when the drouth of the terrible day Is ended and blended with splendid unspeakable spray Of rain and of mist, be the souls of us kissed, so we pray. Be our blossom, O bosom, our fragrant and tenderest rose: Enfold us and hold us and mould us,ânot one of us knows Till thou dost surrender how tender thy splendour, love, glows. MANY LOVES, AND VENUS. Wonderful and delicate in seeming Is this girl fair? Lo! yet another hath eyes gleaming Through blackest hair, And yet another hath eyes dreaming, And sweetest air. Which is tenderest and best and sweetest? The white-limbed maid? Which sways passion's harp with finger fleetest? Which hand hath played Love's melody with ecstasy completest, And most hearts swayed? Beautiful the golden tresses That blind the sun! Tender are the white caresses By strong hearts won. And yet the swift and searching soul confesses Not all is done! O delicate and soft brown glances, O eyes of blue, From each to each the vision dances,â For each sweet hue Sweetness of the former tint enhances And makes each new. Lips with all the scent of roses, And arms that bring The thrilling sense of woodland posies When close they cling, And breast wherein the violet reposes,â You, you, I sing! Yet there comes a woman fairer, With hair that smells Of blossoms unbeholden, rarer,â She brings the dells Of long-lost lands to view, the bearer Of asphodels. She with limitless soft splendour Passes along Our nerves with touching as of tender Outbursts of song: Fragrance she brings that doth engender Ecstasy strong. Far beyond beauty of the others She now is seen; The old flowers were but as weaker brothers, Feeble of mien, To those her splendid bosom mothers, Fostering, serene. Low we bend and do adore her, For now we know The awful fragrance floating o'er her Shoulders of snow; Venus it is: we fall before her, Saying, âSweet, even so!â CHRIST AND BEAUTY.

MEMORY. Sweet face that gazest down the glade, Searching the solemn aisles of shade;â Are past dreams dead, past hopes betrayed? Was once thine heart a blossom fair, Laughing within life's spring-like air,â Is life now over-hard to bear? Thine eyes are pensive; whither stream The swift sad thoughts whose wild wings gleam Across thine heart: what is thy dream? Ah! was it by some summer sea That love's bright hand laid hold of thee, Fast hold,âand thou in vain did'st flee? And dream'st thou now of waves that broke Nigh someone's footstep when he spoke And bowed thy spirit to his yoke? Or was it 'mid the meadow-sweet In some soft mossy green retreat Where thou could'st hear thine own heart beat? In such spot came the conquering tread Of love,âwho bound about thine head His tender wreath of roses red? Are all the roses white to-day, Now love's frail foot has fled away And left the woods and seashore grey? Thou musest surely on such things, And round about thy spirit clings A memory whose mere faint touch stings. A memory of those woods and seas Wherethrough once lingered passion's breeze And love's soft laughter; where are these? NOT ONE? Of the roses that thine hands have handled In sweet past days, Days of gentle summers golden-sandalled, Are there no strays? Not a petal for my heart to foster, O love, O queen,â Did every blossom perish when I lost her, My flower serene? Hast thou not a single blue sky, gleaming Divine for me? Not a starry night, a moon-ray dreaming Above our sea? Not a thought, a kiss, a dear look tender Seeking my gaze? One vision of the swift eyes' splendour, Their deep sea-rays? One vision of the white bright shoulder,â Love, only one? For is not all my dead life colder Without its sun? A little thing it is,âand can it harm thee, This little thing? Just once to let the love-god warm thee With warm soft wing? Yea, once to let the love-god hold thee White breast to breast; To let his radiant arms enfold thee, One hour be blest. Rose-lips, upon my own lips settle! Sweet face, come near! Thou art flaming like a pink rose-petal; Oh, have no fear! Flower-mouth, upon my own mouth glisten; Be not afraid; The love-god's ears, and not another's, listenâ Unwind that braid. Let the dark hair ripple round the shoulder, The shoulder thrill; Let kiss by kiss wax passionate and bolder; Obey love's will.</field>
