Flie vale-bred Muse to heauen-high Mont-ague Honoring thy playnesse with so quaint aspire: It is a baggard Hawke that neuer knew The Fawlkoners fist; It is a drowsie fire That yeelds nor flame nor fume; It is an idle voyce That nere was hard to tune nor sound, nor note nor noise. Great Mont-ague; thrise great in Vertues glorie And therfore dulie great in my affections, Whom not a Pick-thanke spirit of flatterie But well aduised zeale to your perfections Mooues to instile you so: Though likewise so you be In the sublimitie of your blood and Vicomptie. Daigne in your grace the spirit of a man Disastred for vertue; if at least it be Disaster to be winnowed out Fortunes Fan Into the Fan of Grace and Sionrie Wherin repurify'd to Gods eternall glorie The Deuill rues in man old Adams injurie. Though meane and merit-lesse the Muse may seeme To your aduice; as not from Helicon, Yet well I hope the matter will redeeme That fraile default, as spirited from Sion: If Sions holie name be gracious to your eare Hold it in gree; els for the zeale to you I beare, At least your happie Names faire liuerie let it weare. Your Lordsh, humblie at commandement. Anthonie Copley. A Fig for Fortune The Argument to the Reader. An Elizian out-cast of Fortune, ranging on his Iade Melancholie through the Desert of his affliction, in hope to find out some where either ease or end of the same, hapneth first vpon Catoes ghost a spirit of Dispair &amp; self-misdoom which perswades him to kill himselfe: But, for she ended her Oratory with a Sulphur vanish fr? out his sight, he misdoubted both her and her tale. Then posting onward through the residue of the night; he next chanceth on the spirit of Reuenge: She perswades him blood and treacherie against all his enemies, as th' onlie means to remount to pristin blesse in despight of Fortune: But she likewise manifesting in the end the treason of her tale by a sudden whip-away from his eye at the sight of break of day in the East, left him also conceipted of her daunger. Thirdly, rapt from off his Melancholie (which now began to faint vnder him at the light of a new day of Grace) he was suddenlie mounted vpon the Steed of Good Desire, and by him brought to Mount-Sion the Temple of Peace; where by Catechtysius an Hermit (who greatlie woondred to see a distressed Elizian in those partes vnder so happie daies of Eliza) he was by him in the house of Deuotion catechized, and there also celestially arm'd by an Angell, and within a while after in-denized by the high Sacrificator a Champion of that Temple against the insults of Fortune; whom I haue titled by the name of Doblessa in respect of the double danger both of her luring and lowring inconstancie: She, whiles the Sionttes were all in peacefull adoration of Almightie God in the Temple, came with her Babellonian-rout to assault the place, but warest soons by the valure of those Templers shamefullie repulsed: Feast and thankes was made to God therfore throughout all the Region in which solemnitie the Grace of God houering ouer the multitude in the Procession time like a virgin attended vpon with all the Court of heauen, showr'd downe Roses amongst them, leauing them there a scambling for the same. The Elizian was one that scambled his lap-full among the rest: and for he thought it was his soueraigne Ladie Eliza, and those Roses hers, he was suddenly in ioy therof rapt home againe to Elizium. Vested in sable vale, exild from Ioy, I rang'd to seeke out a propitious place, Where I might sit and descant of annoy And of faire Fortune, altered to disgrace, At last, euen in the confines of the night I did discerne aloofe a sparkling light, Then set I spurres vnto my Melancholie, A Iade wheron I had ridden many a mile, Which lesse then in the twinkling of an eye, Brought me vnto that fatall lights beguile: Where I might see an agonizing beast, Bleeding his venym blood out at his brest. His vpper shape was faire-Angelicall, The rest belowe, all whollie Serpentine, Cole blacke incroching vpon his pectorall, And rudely inrowlled in a Gorgon-twine, His eyes like Goblins stared heer and there, In fell disdayne of such disfigured geare. At last he spi'd me, and staring on my face, He rear'd his mongrel-lumpe vp towards me, Fainting and falling in his Deaths-disgrace, And yet enforcing still more stabbes to die, Then thus he vauntingly began to tell me Of such his fortitude in aduersitie. Welcome deer guest (quoth he) to Catoes Ghost, Welcome true witnesse of my fortitude, Seest thou not how this hell-blacke shape almost Hath quite subdu'd my vpper-albitude? It is aduersitie vpon my state, Which see how I reuenge it desperate. With that, as with a new supplyed flood The angrie streame beares quite adowne the riuer All obstacle with vnappeased mood: So his enraged hand did fierce deliuer Fresh death-stabbes to his loath'd mortalitie Euen at the naming of aduersitie. And then in four-fold misconsorted voice Of Life and Death: Rage and Disdaine, he added: Whilom I was a man of Romes rejoyce Whiles happy Fortune my estate vppropped: But once when CÃ¦sar ouer-topped all, Then (loe) this mid-night shape did me befall. Then gan I to conceipt my Censure-ship, My Senatorie-pomp, and libertie All base-subjected to his Tyrant-whip: My mind was mightie against such miserie, And rather would I die magnanimous Then liue to see a CÃ¦sar ouer vs. It was ynough that the Thessalian fieldes Suckt vp the mutuall bloud-shed of our men, That Pompey dies, and all the Empire yeeldes To CÃ¦sars dauncing Fortune, and Omen: Cato must die as free from seruitude As he disdaineth CÃ¦sars altitude. Yet for my Countrey is a part of me, And it is all subjected to disgrace, Loe, that's my serpentine obscuritie For which I spight, and spit on CÃ¦sars face, And stab me with a quaint disdaine and anger Because I will not liue in CÃ¦sars danger. Thou therefore that doest seem a dolefull wight, View me the president of Cares redresse, And if that Fortune be aboue thy might Yet death is in thy power and readinesse: Disdaine Misfortune then t'insult vpon thee Seeing that to die is all so faire and easie. Death is misfortunes monarchizing foe, Prime Nature of Almightie fortitud, Eternall Sanctuarie from vnrest and woe, Fames Arke and all our frailties Period: Our lyies true tuchstone, natures offertory, And bridge to sweet Eliziums eternitie. And as for base Aduersitie, what is it? But Gloryes graue, a coward mindes ingalley, The carrion of our lyfe, suppresse of spirrit, Shadow of Ioues hate: Disdaines obloquie, Helles ongate, an Owlish conuersation, All Ioyes deprife, and sorrowes invndation. Looke not so downe agast at what I say, But with a generous erected front, Number these willing woundes (my hartes defray) To Glory sole land-ladie of this account: They are the Tythes I pay to eternall Fame: There is not any one of them prophane. Be not injayld to base Aduersitie, Rather slip out thy life at gloryes windoe, One stab will send thee to eternity, And rid thee quite and cleane of all thy woe. Then there lies life-lesse all Calamity, Thy name and Spirrit fayre amountes to glory. It is not as vulgaritie esteemes Sincere worth to be beblest of Fortune, A fickle Dame that commonlie misdeemes Those that her fauours most of all importune. Blesse thou thy selfe, and if that Fortune curse thee, Die in despight of her, and her discourt'sie. Oh what a base ingenerous sight it is, To see men crooch and pewle at her vaine Altars, Offring their presents to her peeuishnesse And there withall, their necks vnto her haltars: Be thou subsistant of thy selfe alonely, And if thou canst not liue, yet die with glorie. Fie on those lowtish growt-head lobbernowlles That slander Nature with their Modicums, I tell thee Natur's like to Mary gowldes, Largely display'd to twentie thousand Sunnes, Which if they cease to shine in Majestie, Doe shut themselues and are content to die. Thy Spirrit is a particle of Ioue, It scornes indignitie and meane suffize, Like as a flame, or oyle, it mounts aboue, And take but Glory from it, and it dies: Yet dies it not, but to indignitie, Mounting by Death, to Fames eternitie. There is no hell like to declined glorie, Nor is Prometheus Vulture halfe so fell As the sad memorie of a happie storie To him, that in aduersitie doeth dwell: Ah, let him die that is not as he was, With ending blesse breake he the houre-glasse. What booteh it to liue in base contempt In euer melancholie-adumbred mood? A fable to the vulgar babblement, A muddie ebbe after a Chrystall flood? Out with thy candle, let it burne no more, When once thou art become the worlds eye-sore. And tell not me of dutie vnto life; Nature is as indifferent to death, Life led in joyes abandon and deprife Is Natures deeper graue, then earth beneath: It is not death, that which the world calles dying, But that is death, which is all joyes denying. Nature disdaines all grosse encountring meat Fore-fed with Nectar, and Ambrosian sweetes, And Night that is the merrie dayes defeat We see how Nature giues it drowsie greetes: Now: Sleep by night is but a silent signe How sweet it is to die in Ioyes decline. And then as is the morrowe-dawning day A fresh re-blesse to Natures next awake; So to the wretch that dies disgrace away Elizium is his second lifes partake: Where he shall triumph in eternity, And Fame the Chanteclere of such his glory. Loe, I a president before thine eyes; This gore imports the glorie of my Ghost, Who but fore-weening CÃ¦sars tyrannies Fore-doom'd my self in care-preuenting post: Then thou that art a verie wretch indeed, Oh, why deferrest thou so long to bleed? Out with that Iayle-bird of aduersitie, Disdaine to liue at Natures joylesse leasure: Bale drown'd in gore and magnanimitie Is an vpdiue to all eternall pleasure: Thinke what a Fame-renowned thing it is In crimson floods to warfare base de-blisse. Deferre no longer then thy doome of death, But Champion-like confound Calamitie, Prosperities Satrap feares not to vnsheath His kil-care blade gainst fleshes fearful frailtie: Flesh of it selfe will one day turne to dust, Then doome it thou thy selfe since so it must. Thou would'st not gladly eate an Abricocke, Or Peache vnpar'd, because their rinde is bitter, And fear'st thou then to giue thy flesh the stocke, That so vnkindely bittereth all thy better? Oh, off with it, and yeeld thy sweetes to Ioue, And he will counter-sweete thee with his loue. He will imbosome thee in his embrace, And Ioye-embalme thee in his Heauen-delights, Thy skarres and gashes he will faire deface, And sanctifie thee with alhallowed rytes: Thou shalt be as a Meteor ouershining All mortall glory in her dust declining. There will we meet thee in Vermilion vest, I, Otho, Anniball, and all the rest, Fames choisest Martyrs, who in Fates detest, Doom'd all our selues to euerlasting rest. There will we magnifie thy happie woundes, And high applaud th? with Crownets &amp; Crownes, With that I drew out my emboldened blade, Resolu'd to massacre my loathed life: When (loe) the Ghost from out my sight did vade, As though to tell his Ioue of my arife: But such a Sulphur stench hee left behind him That I in dreade thereof shooke euerie lim. And therwithall my sword fell to the ground And I misdoubted some illusion: Such was the safetie that then I found In drowsie dread, and deaths confusion; Prophanely spoken: t'was no frailties deed, But God alonlie stood thee then in steed. So then remounted on my Sable jade, I rang'd ore craggy cliffes and desart dales In way-lesse wander, and in Horrors shade, One while conceipting Catoes death-auailes, And then anon reflecting on his stinke, Thus strayd I most in dread &amp; deaths instinct. Thrise drew I out my dagger for to stab me And then so oft I mus'd why Cato stunke so, Me thought there should no such disglory be In sacred Ghosts, freed from the filth of woe: So was my moody mindes perplexed wander Partial on lifes behalfe gainst deadly danger. Then on I rode, and riding through a dale Hell-like adumbred with a duskie gloome, A suddaine fatall blast did me assaile And droue me to a second damned doome, Where I might see a more then hell-black finger That pointed me, and said: Loe yonder, yonder. With that my Melancholy star'd round about And like a whirle-wind posted to the place, Where I might heare a voyce that roared out Reuenge, reuenge, thy dollorous disgrace: And then eftsoons all in a Sulphur-flame Appear'd vnto my sight a shape of shame. Her face was Skowl-regarding on the ground, Her eyes like Heclas euer-sparkling fires, Her finger on her mouth was a dumb bound Of her Cyclopian frets and fell desires: In th' other hand she bare a fierie sheafe, And all her body was as pale as death. Her haire was Snake-incurl'd Medusa-like, Hauing the power t'instone me where I stood: So was I sencelesse all but in dislike And deadly horror of so dread a Bug: At last she fretted out an angry noise And thus inspeeched it into a voice. Feare not my wan and moody misproportion, For (I confesse) I am no fondlings joy, Nor am I of a wanton disposition As is the God of Loue that idle boy, Yet am I a joy in another kind To such as in vn-ioy most ioy doe find. I am Reuenge, the doome of iniuries: The Misers refuge, and reuiue to blesse Occasions Argus, pith of Tragedies The summe of pollicie in all distresse: Wrathes thunder-bolt, and triumph ouer those That in their jollitie work others woes. Th' injurious Gallant in his Commick-braue I agonize with vnexspected bale, Because he shall not thinke that in the graue Lies nought but impotence and deaths auaile; I'le shew him that the worme hath power to moue, And none so lowe but may amount aboue. There is a PhÅnix of Aduersitie That faire results from her incinderment, And dares to braue with an vndaunted eie Prosperities shine, &amp; brightest blandishment: It is Reuenge, t'is I can stare it out, And make it by disgrace the Misers flout. I rear'd Corelian from his exile state To triumph ouer Romes ingratitude, And CÃ¦sar I did whollie animate To down with Pompeys scornfull altitude, His sute deni'd him by the Senate-house, Did cause me make him Rome-Emperious. Of latter dayes a Bourbon in disgrace I arm'd against his Lieges injurie, And gaue him victorie at Pauia-chace Where he beheld him in captiuitie: What though he were a Traitor in so doing, Tis statelie done to ouer-top a King. To be faire Fortunes euer Carpet-darling Is femall glorie: But Reueng'd disgrace That's truly Masculine, and rich triumphing: Al peace-content is too too cheap and base: What manhood is it still to feed on Chickins Like infant nurse-boys in nice Fortunes kitchins? Giue me the man that with vndaunted sperit Dares giue occasion of a Tragedie: And be content for his more after-merit To be downe beaten from felicity: To th' end that with a fierce amount he may Re-blesse himselfe in spight of Fortunes nay. T'is braue to plunge adowne into the deep And so vp-bound againe aboue the waue, To be continually a mountain-sheep Is Cockrell-like, it is a dung-hill braue: The crauin Cocke is hartlesse from his hill, Shame to be so that hast a manly will. To be depos'd from blisse by injurie, Is double glorie to remount to it, Nor is thy title lost to dignitie Vnlesse suppresse of spirite forfeit it: Misfortunes power cannot foyle thy right, Doe thou but beare a minde in her despight. We cannot say that man is ouercome That still beares vp his arme against his foe, Nor that he is sincerely out-run Whom the Corriuals trip doth ouerthrow: VVhat ere is lost with fore-wits vnpreuention, Win it againe with after-wits contention. This humane fate, sometime to slip and fall, But to ingrouell in durt is beastlie base: To rise againe, oh that is Iouiall, Or els reuenge to death the downe-disgrace: Therefore, thou hast a spirit of despight, As well as in good hap to take delight. The gallant man vnhorst amidst his foes Fightes to the death his latest wrath away, And when he can no more: with mops and mowes He floutes both them, and Death, and Destinie: So if not Victor, yet vnvanquished He dies to euerlasting liuelihed. Be not as is the coward Scorpion That rounded all about with ashie embers Dispaires and dies in self-destruction Renting with fierce enrage his venym members: But if that Ioue nill ayd thy fortitude Downe to all Acharon, and the Furie brood. Hell holdes in honor the braue minded man That knowes the price and value of his head, That measures not Renowne by inch or span, But by th' eternitie of Ioues Godhead, That skornes to brooke base infelicitie, Or pocket vp degraded dignitie. And haply Ioue himselfe supplants thy state To see how thou canst scamble vp againe, And scuffle manly with malignant fate To a redoubled glories rich attaine: Then cheerly (man) inhearten all thy sperites And dead Reuenge thy miseries demerites. Loe, I thy Aduocate vnto the Hagges Will still importune thy Prosperitie, And be at hand with poison, and with dagges To execute each plotted tragedie: Misfortune all not scoffe at thy confusion, If hell and I befriend thee in coniunction. Lay but thy hand vpon thy conscience, And faire in-vow mee in an earnest spirit, So shalt thou compasse Tragick consequence On all thy foes that now so frollick it. They shall no longer feast vpon thy frets Nor register thy woes in their banquets. Thou shalt eniowle them one against another With hostill jealousie, and dead debate: I tell thee (man) all friendship is vnsure Founded vpon anothers downe estate: Nor ioyes he long against Reuenges doome, That wrong in-states him in anothers roome. Heauen is the Arbiter, and wils it so, I and the Furies are the instruments To act that iustice in all tragicke woe, Now is it in this case our good intents To joyne with vs thy manuall act heerin That more then pristin glory thou maist win. But say thou winne not pristin glorie by it Yet shalt thou see thy foes in downe disgrace, Thy selfe shalt act it, such shall be thy merit, And such thy glorie in a higher place: What greater glorie can betide the vale Then force the Mountain-top adowne to fall? So shall thy glorie not be lost, but left, Yea losse to them that all so dearly buy it, When thou shalt PhÅnix-like of blisse bereft Rise from thy ruines to a higher merit: Degraded from a puppit Commicke-stage To act the statelie Tragick personage. Chang'd to a faire enfiered Salamander Breathing Reuenges bright &amp; sacred flames, Which high inspirits men to lofty matter In quaint disdaine of aulike infant games; Games of the bodie, follies of the minde, Oh, how t'is base to liue so like a Hinde. Nature hath giuen you male &amp; female willes, The one wherwith to couet meriments, The other to detest all aduerse ils, Now is almightie Ioues great woonderments More in his Thunder-boltes then in his sweetes, To shew Reuenge more woorth then Pleasures greets. Then arme thy selfe Reuenges Champion, To bandie away thy foes, and all disgrace VVith polliticke dissimulation Of contrarie language, and contrary face: As the Camelion changeth still his hue VVith euery obiect cullor: so change thou. So maist thou close Camelion-like conceale Thy tragicke shape of Horror and Reuenge, Whiles they misdoubting not thy false reueale Are caught vnwares like Woodcocks in a sprenge, Such is the honour of Aduersitie, With sleightes to vndermine Prosperitie. Be to thy oath, as th' Ape is to his blocke, Sometimes sticke to it, sometimes flit from it As pregnant pollicy may thee prouoke: T'is foole-sincerity, and want of wit To make a pot to breake thy head withall, Or rather not to breake it first of all. Vse Friend and Foe, and Neuter all alike, Onlie as instrumentall implements To thy designe; thy aymed stroke to strike: And fee them but with ayery complements: That done, and thy affaire effected, Destroy them all for feare thou be detected. Dead dogges barke not, nor stands it with thy honour To be vpbrayded with a curtesie; Much lesse to be employd in like deuoir According Quidpro Quoes seruilitie: Such is the summe of perfect policie To worke securely with Vulgaritie. Be close, and iealous in each action For that close dealing is good Speeds assur?ce; And Iealousie's the Sentinell of Caution; And bear thou still in mind this circumstance; If all good fortune, and aduise should faile thee To haue a starring hole for after safetie. T'was meger Prudence in the antique Sages That but with Goodnes could recure an Euill: Giue me the man that with wittes pollices Can Saint a Deuill with another Deuil: That can so shift, and shuffle the cards in fist, As turne vp whatsoeuer Trump he list. T'is Heauens attaine to send thy foes to Hell With mutuall murthers in Seditions field: The vpper Buckets fall into the well The lowers faire amount we see doth yeeld: Such is the merit of Reuenges deed, With others wrack to work thine own good speed. At least to die in well appeased wrath And in suruiue of all thine enemies Is stately dying: t'is faire lie downe and laugh, And an vp-rise to Ioues benignities, Elizium and Fame in after ages, Reuenges blessed Rightes and Appennages. Then come, imbrace me with a firme assent And thinke no idle voyce sollicits thee; I tell thee (man) in thy arbitrement Lies all thy glorie, and felicitie: I'le be thy hand-maid heer in earth belowe, The rest aboue great Ioue he will bestow. So sayd, she rear'd her skowle down-looke on And vagrantlie regarding round about In Period-pawse; At last as one bestraught She star'd, and trembled, and began to powt And suddenly she vanisht out of sight Because now in the East it dawn'd day-light. Euen so (quoth I) is it Reuenges guize To be in force by Night, be gone by Day? Such is not the instinct of Paradize, God graunt it be no Plutonicke affray: Oh what it is to be a mortall man Subiect to all the guiles and sleights of Satan. Yet for her speech was consonant to Nature, I wisht sh' had been an Oracle of truth; So credulous is Angers moodie vigure When once it is in-CÃ¦sared in youth: And hand in-handed with a quaint Disdaine Iniurious disglorie to sustaine. Yea what is not the miser apt to doe, What not beleeue to mittigate his euill? Well may he faine a patient outward hue, But not exile his inward damned deuill, The Vulture of despite that neuer dies But rents and teares his heart in rauin-wise. Now Chanteclere the vigill of the night Crew broad day light: when Titan in the East Peece-meale appearing in his pristin bright Broad-waked euery creature, man and beast, Ech musick-bird beblessing his amount Both in the humble vale and haughtie mount. When (loe) my jade vnsprighted, and vnnighted, Rag'd and engag'd himselfe to all aduenture Ore hedge, and ditch, and flood, so fell affrighted He was to see the Sunne, so shone a creature: All as the Tench in waterles despaire Beateth himselfe to death in spight of ayre. So on I hasted at my jades behest, As whilom Phaeton in his skyey carte, Weake (God he knowes) to rule so fierce a beast, Deadly feare-frighted both in heart and arte: But whome our Lords safe prouidence bespeedeth, No humaine power of heart or arte he needeth. At last in processe of an ouer-tire My moody beast stood stil in palsie-wise, Trembling and fainting in a daunted ire, (Such is the end of Rages ryotize:) Then had I leasure for to looke about me, And (loe) I spide a Rock in shining glorie. I hy'd me to it with a pleasing pace, And yet not pleasant, for t'was all to slow: So flight is Melancholie to darke disgrace And deadly drowsie to a bright good morrow; Yet on I march'd, and marueil'd at the sight, I neuer in all my life saw thing so bright: As more and more I neer'd vnto the place So by degrees my Melancholy fainted, When (loe) anon with a religious pace A snow-white Iennet towards me aduanced: His name was Good desire, his saddle greene Was Reuerend Solace of a godly spleen. Whereat my jade affrighted and despighted Sped all to naught as myst before the Sonne: When I eftsoons internallie delighted Was rapt by Good desire vnto Deuotion: A penall place, yet parcell of the rock, And brighter then the Noony Zodiack. There kneel'd a reuerend Sophie all in teares With needle-pointed Discipline correcting His Fleshes frailtie: Oh how he besmears The place with penall bloud, and blubbering: His hart was wholly fixt on Christ his Passion, So shew'd his Crucifixe-contemplation. Before him was a Deaths-head full of wormes, The picture of a Graue, and an Hower-glasse, A map of Doomsday, and Hell in fearfull formes, And Heauen figur'd all in Saintlie sollace: His pale and megre countenance areeded His spare poor fare, and how hard he bedded. Standing behind him, he was in a trance, And I betooke my Eie to a steddie gaze, My Mind to an amaze at so great suffrance, So penall suffrance in so bright a place, And now I see (said I) there is a blisse Euen in Aduersitie what ere it is. And thus aside I argued the case: In place so bright what meane these drearements? A heauie case deserues a dolefull place Since bale and blesse are aduerse Complements: And yet the Glowe-worme in the darkest night Though blacke it be, shines foorth a starry bright. Cato and Reuenge were blacke, and both to blame Th' one in sulphure stenche, th' other in Lights abhorr, And Melancholye was the Iade of shame That darkeling brought me to that dubble dorr; A better horse I hope hath brought me hether For both the place is bright, and tis fayr weather. Long haue I rang'd to finde a place of ease Whear I may passe away my pensiue playntes, And happly if this be now that place of peace Heer rest I euer in my woes attayntes: Heer in this Caue, and in this sable shrowde Dye I a Caytiffe vnder Fortunes clowd. This aged man and I will both together Complaine in common our calamytie; That haply whiles we striue t'outplaine each other Suche our ambition may swage our miserie, Or both at once, may cracke as ouerstrained, Ambitious dying is a glorie gained, But (well I wot) thou wrong'st this holy place By mis-constructing it to care and bale, T'is puddle sacrilege so to disgrace The grace of God, through errors rude misprisall: What though the man doe seeme disconsolate, Somewhat it is doth thee exhilerate. For why, I felt my spirit all possest, With a reuiued hope to happinesse; It was the Grace of God in my vnrest That in-lie cheer'd me vp to future blesse, Deer gift of God, the Character of life And heauenly make-peace of our ghostly strife. It is the Raye, and Speech of heauen to man, The Rainbowe-pledge of Gods beneuolence, The Limbecke of our justice, and the Fan That winnoweth sinne away from innocence: Prime moouer, and efficient cause of good To all that are redeem'd with Christ his blood. Whiles thus with infant-zeale I did applaud The in-come grace of God into my heart In full detest of fore-affected fraud, Loe, now this penall Sage began to start From out his trance, and with a heauenlie voyce, And armes a crosse, he bid his soule rejoyce. Reioyce (quoth he) at this eternall truth, The man is blest that for Gods justice sake Sustaines with Patience reproch and ruth, Our Lord hath promist that he wil partake His heauen to him: His name be prais'd therfore, And so he kist the Crosse, and said no more. With that my heart exulted in my breast, As faire presaging weale vnto my woe; For why I was not vulgarlie distrest But, for a cause that bore an honest showe, Yet for my frailtie was impatient I long'd for speedy death or solagement. Then stept I to that man of Mysteries With carefull Complement least to offend, When he eftsoons with reuerend arise Did recomplie me like a perfect friend: The teares of joy that trill'd adowne his chin Did sweare what true affection was within. And lastly he thus embracingly bespake me, Welcome (Elizian-man) a thousand-fold More deere and shone to Catechrysius eye Then all the pleasant pride of Pearle or Gold: Rare, yea all too rare are now adayes Elizas subjectes seen to passe this wayes. Belike yee are a Paradized people That so contain your selfes in home-delights, As though that only vnder your steeple And no wher els were all May-mery Rights: A blessed people ye are, if it be so And yet me thinkes thou seem'st a man of woe. Wherto I answered all with humble thanks: First, that I was the man he tooke me for Bred and brought vp on fayre Elizas bankes, Next, did I largely shew him furthermore How blessedly we liue, as hee had heard Vnder Elizas peacefull power and guard. And as for my peculiar distresse, I tolde him so I seem'd, and so I was The Rag of Fortune: Badge of base deblesse, The Spunge of care, a broken Hower-glasse: The Finger-man of shame, and Obloquie Downly degraded from Felicitie. I told him of my dreary iournement On moodie Melancholie; and how I sped With Cato, and Reuenges babblement, And how, along the Desart as I fled I met with Good Desire a goodly Steed That brought me thether in my ghostly need. I would haue told him more of my arange Euen all the verie conscience of my case, The cause of such my reprobate exchange From blesse to bale: &amp; how fr? place to place Bowndlesse in care, I rang'd to bownd my Fate, Content to die: but not die desperate. But he eftsoones preuented me, and said: Oh happie thou, if so thou knew'st thy hap, I tell thee (man) thou art right faire apaid Exil'd from Mammon into Iesus lap: Come sit we downe, and I will shew thee how In this distresse, thou mayst nor breake, nor bow. So downe we sate: my heart was festiuall My eare was eager-liquorish to embaite Good Catechrysius his Cordiall: Who then with eies to heauen eleuate And crosse-laid armes did vow syncerely All loue, and truth in what he meant to shew me. And then (quoth he) deare Englishman, suppose Me not vnciuill t'interrupt thy tale, For in our Lord I well aread thy woes And Charitie hies me to recure them all: Now all is but the action of the Mind, That rectifi'd, the rest is all but wind. Know then, thow art no better then a man Natur'd indifferently, to weale or woe, Who ere he be that's borne of a woman Is first just nothing, next an Embrio, Then borne into the world in impotence Poore interest to future Excellence. Nay borne in sable sinne to Gods offence, Nipt in the blossome by the blast of Hell, Spur-gall'd of Adam both in soule and sence And hodge-podged between a man &amp; Deuel, A fardle of frailties doom'd vnto damnation So sore we haue incurr'd Gods indignation. If these be titles of felicitie, Ah, poore felicitie, vnpleasant Pride: Rooted in hell, brancht in mortalitie And round imbark'd with sin on euerie side: Nor are we thus disgrac'd but of our selfes For first we eate the Apple of all these helles. We might haue chosen in Adams Libertie Whether t'haue eate that Apple yea or no, But needs we would aduenture: And wot you why? Forsooth of Pride both good and bad to know: So slunke from vs the glorie and grace of God Leauing vs quite to our selfe breeching-rod Heerhence we couet counterfeit content, Sublime mundanitie, and our Fleshes ease, Rating the trash of earth true solagement And euery toy of price our sence to please: Such is our frailtie, and yet we see it not So to subject vs to so seruile Lot. And such the matter of thy discontent, Because thou ouer-prizest Fleshes sence, Rating the world at all too high a rent Wheras it is but dust and Gods offence: The Mammon of iniquitie in Scripture phrase And but a meere Crocadyle-amaze. Conceipt thy selfe no better then thou art, A sorie Iourney-man from birth to death And all this world but matter of vndesart And a meere momentarie trash-bequeath: Death doomes all Flesh at last, and Flesh-affaires Be it Fleshes joyes, or Fleshes seruile cares. Blesse being the perfect Counterpane of good This world is not of worth to correspond it It being but trash ore-flowne with Frailties flood And deep indown'd from heauens fellowship: Then vp to heauen amount thy true ambition And as for earth out-care it in contrition. Not to dispaire and die as Cato told thee, For that is base Pusillanimitie And Natures most vnhallowed infamie, Treason to God, and fell disloyaltie So to betray his Fort and Character To selfe-misdoome, and drearie disaster. We ought not cancell Gods eternall doome Vn-labelling our life from his faire Charter, For such is diffidence in his holidoome And prowd in-officing vs in his affaire: Nor can we kill Calamitie by death For he is just in earth, and hell beneath. Thou canst not flit from his almightie doome He being th' Arbiter of all, and nothing: Who gaue thee Essence out of Vacuum Can paine thy ashes all in earth reposing: Well maist thou shift his anger into grace But not depriue thee from his heauenly face. As vaine it is to thinke Reuenges deed Can counter-doome thy bale to blessednesse, The power of Flesh being but a rotten reed And selfely inclined vnto all distresse: Then since we are so wretched of our selfes Add worse to yll doth but encrease our helles. Such is Reuenge: It is a haggard yll, A Luciferiall ranke vncharitie: The venym, and blacke-Santus of our will Vnreasons rage; spawne of Impietie, Breath of Despaire, Prime-brat of Enuies brood, And all good Natures Satyr-Antipode. Reuenges arme rear'd vp against the Foe Aimes to defeat God of his interest Who clausually reseru'd that worke of woe Vnto his owne judiciall behest; Thou art a man, and once didst sucke thy mother, Thou canst not judge thy selfe, much lesse another. And what know'st thou whether haply for thine owne Or for thy Predecessors sinnes thou sufferest, God oft transfers his indignation From the offending East to th' ending West. Or whether it be to trie thy patience, And flush the more thy good obedience. If it be for thy sinnes, oh happy thou That art so temporally corrected: Such is Gods mercy, not his Iustice-blow, A worser doome is to thy euill indebted: For God being good in all infinitie Such is thy sinnes, and hels affinitie. And if for thy fore-fathers trespasses, T'is braue to be so good a Sacrifice, God earst to expiate thy amisses Being a president before thine eies Of willing death; wee are not borne only Vnto our selfes: Suche is vncharitie. The feeble Nature euen of Flesh and Blood Hath been so kind to die for Ancestrie, Gentility records Eneas good In that he bore his aged fathers frailtie Through Troyes flames: much more ought Charitie Beare patiently anothers penaltie. But shall I say that haplie in this case Our Lord is pleas'd to trie thy patience, Thy valure, and obedience in disgrace? Oh, that were all-too glorious a pretence: For (well ye wot) that Souldiour is a King That choycelie is employ'd in warfaring. T'is Scowndrell-glorie still to sit at ease In gawdie satisfaction of thy sence: Nay, t'is no glorie at all, but a disease That Canker-like consumes thine Innocence. Now God being pleas'd to cure thee thereof Doth thus confound it all into a scoffe. And yet confounds it so, as thou maist see His Iustice and his Mercie ioind together, Thy yll contrould to future dignitie, So dooth the goodnesse of thy cause auerre: If God did meane thy eternall infamie, Worse passiue cause had foule befall'n thee. Thou canst not haue a more assured pawne Of Gods benignitie then a good cause, It being vnto thy soule a sacred dawne Of heauens day; and an especiall clause Or Charter-warrant of Saluation By a secure Conscience-attestation. Not all the glorie of this world is worth The minnim-Emphosis of a good Conscience: The verie penall teares it sendeth foorth Are more then pearles of Indie-excellence: Much more are they Emperiall dignities Her inward Ioyes and Iocundities. Say that the Corpes of such a Conscience Lie all in mange before the Misers dore, His name as hell held in the worlds offence, Yet is he not vnfortunate therefore; For heauen and he being still in good conjunction All that's but vapor, and no sound confusion. Nay t'is to thee a haughtie merit-matter If brookt with patient valure to the end; Which easely thou maist doe, if thou consider That Iesus tempts thy patience as a friend, Not in his rage aboue thy power and strength, Whom he reprooues at first, he saues at length. And sooth to say, what is Prosperitie That so should make thee abhor Aduersitie? Euen CÃ¦sars loftie pomp, and soueraigntie Is not by ods sincere felicitie; Subiect to Care and Alteration Through Enuie, Errour and Adulation. How much adoe is done ere men attaine To wealth and glorie by Ambition? Still carke and care shares halfe the seruile gaine, The rest remaines to Deaths confusion: T'is well if tart Synderisie and Hell Triumver not to towlle the passing-bell. Care in attaining, and care in attaine Care is the lower and the vpper staire: Such carefull glorie is but glorious paine, Yea care, or care-lesse either, all's but aire: Feast it in care, or feast it carelesly Death is the latter Harpie of all glory. Besides, how many Villaines are aduanc'd To such theatricall, and stagie-state Whilst Vertue lies obliuiously entranc'd, Neglected, and disdain'd as out of date: Besides the multiplicitie of abuse That is in such mundanities mis-use. Whereas the patient Satrap in distresse Behonesteth his guiltie suffrance: And if he suffer for Gods righteousnesse, Loe, there the summe of all true valliance: Heauens Machabe he is that so downe-dies Guiltie of all glorie, and Gods deere dainties. Who heares his name a thousand yeeres hence Will giue it glorie, praise, and reuerence As to a Temples ruin-Monuments Rased in Sacrilege, and Gods offence: He will be-villaine those that did the deed As Scowndrell-Agents of Hells blacke areed. We are not borne to Fortunes complements, As soueraigne dainties; but as Vertues tooles Wherwith to shape vs perfect lineaments Of honorable Manhood: And not as Fooles To dote vpon the Pensill in our hand And not depaint vs like to Gods command. Vertue's the Ladie of our Humanitie, And Fortune but the hand-maid of our merit, Now, were it homelie done to magnifie The meane aboue the maine: T'were pettie sperit To slip our nettes into the Sea for water And pardon Fish, as no part of the matter. This life is but a warfare against sinne And either Fortune is but sinnes Coate-armour, Be it bright or blacke, great danger lies therein If thou resist not with a haughtie valour: T'is witlesse yeelding to her gawdements, And cowardize vnto her drearements. What skils it whether, we fight with blacke or white If blacke and white be both our enemies, The one in guile, th' other in flat despight? The Goblin-Bugs, and Faery Hiedegies Are both the shades of hell, and night-affrayes Encounter, not assent quelles their dismayes. And why are we the image of our God The Monarches ouer all Elementaries? But to controwll with Reasons righteous rod All flesh and bloods fraile sensualities; T'is sensualitie, and pettie power To mal-content thee for a fading flower. Stand thou on Reasons haughty Promontorie Superiour and secure ouer all disgrace, Rage wind, and waue, &amp; horror round about thee Yet all is glorie and peace in that bright place: Nor Death, nor Hell can damnifie thy honer So long as Reasons arme beares vp thy banner. Oh generous minded men that can esteeme All state inferiour to their mindes degree, And not abandon it to base misdeeme Of any Fortunes power aboue her glee: But can out-stare it with a quaint regard In reference to merite, and Gods grand reward. That can conceipt all Fortune as a Fog Bee't black or bright, all but a matter of aire, If bright, oh then it doth but flatter and cog, If blacke, it drowns thee with a flood of care, Vnlesse thy mind be as a Sunne aboue it Faire ouer-shining all her mist-demerit. Faire Fortune is a Bog, a dauncing danger, And Temperance must foot it with a modest pace; Her frowne, a gulfe that drownes the hartlesse stranger That cannot wend with Patience his disgrace; Both that and it are mortuarie matter If fed vpon in Indiscretions platter. Submit not then thy sacred Substantiue To Fortunes hestes: but as thou art of Nature, So still continue thy prerogatiue Aboue her blandishing and spightfull power, So shone a Patrimonie as thy Mind Let neuer Fortune wast it out of kind. Thou art no part of Fortune, but thine owne: Vertue thy fore-guide, Heauen thy attaine, Good death, not loftie life thy best Renowne, Contented mind thy glories after-gaine: Without content all glorie is but gall, And with content disgrace is festiuall. Content's the Spunge of true felicitie, The Cordiall against degraded blesse, Corriuall to the highest Empirie, The badge of Innocence and Righteousnesse, Vertues enthrone, Rent of a manlie mind To God for whatsoeuer state assign'd. It is the PhÃ¦nix of fore-glories Embers: Patience her wing, Heauen is her amount, It is the Christopher whose manly members Wafteth the miser-man through all affrount, It is the true and perfect Salamander, Breathing vitalitie in flames of fire. Not so the Skowndrell in his greatest glorie, For ther is no Content in guilt of euill, A skowll down-looke, and swart synderisie Betokening him a member of the Deuill: He cannot with a faire erected front Be-Abba God: nor yeeld him good accompt. His glorie in guilt of yll is as a flower Begnawne with an accursed Caterpiller, Or as an Apple perisht in the coure Though faining outwardlie a faithfull faire; Oh fatall incense, oh accursed fume That so choaks vp the wretch doth it assume. Wheras the others conscientiall-content Doth feast his Fates, and ciuillize their rage, Turning their gall to glee and solagement And faire be-heauening hell with her asswage; Hee's as a Bwoy aboue the bosterous waue Dauncing to scorne the Seas ybillowy-braue. So strong in power is his sincere incline To Gods ordaine and holie prouidence, Resting therin as in a sacred shrine Or Sanctuarie against all hels offence: The Deuils eager-gripe cannot confound Him whom our Lords protection doth bound. There is no hell but in our Gods offence: Please him, and boldlie plunge adowne the deep Of all accurse: his holy Prouidence Being the Argus which doth neuer sleep, Will on the wings of safe Protection Still beare the just man vp from all perdition. What hap can hap amisse to Gods beblest? What waue can surge aboue his prouidence? The Hagges of hell are chain'd to his behest Hell gates obey his high omnipotence: Diue downe to Hell, if he beare vp thy chin Wel maist thou sink a while, nere drowne therein. If once thy hope be anchored in God No waue, no bluster can endanger thee, Thy foot from falling is securely shod He corresponding thy fidelitie: If God thy Center be and thy defence Be Hell, be Deuil thy Circumference. The Tyrants steele, the Hang-mans Axel tree, His strangles, mangles, and his fierie doomes Cannot confound true magnanimitie Founded on Gods true loue &amp; hollidoomes; His life in gore, his Ghost in shades of hell Are more at ease than anie tongue can tell. The earthen minded man cannot conceaue So haughtie glorie in disglorie and dole: His groueling appetite doth so bereaue His wit, impelling it to another gole; Hee's so besotted in his Leprosie That it alonlie he esteems true glorie. But time will come when at a iust Tribunall The iust mans miserie, and the misers glee Will come in Coram, and bee doom'd for all: Then mourning good shall mount to Maiestie, And sin-polluted glorie downe discend T'irreparable dollour without end. Then vÃ¦ to guiltie glorie, glorious guilt, VÃ¦ to suppresse of vertue, aduance of vice; The Rascalls towre on Vertues ruines built Must then adowne, and he repent the price: Oh, farre more happie then disgraced good, Then Vice aduanc'd to skowndrell altitud. But thou wilt say it is Detraction, It is thy name defam'd among the just Thy life bely'd through misconstruction That more then all thy glorie in the dust Be-hels and tortureth thy manly mind, It being a mischiefe of a woorser kind. Bee't so (Elizian-man) I doe confesse Detraction is indeed a monstrous euell, Foule Harpie of honour, Night of righteousnesse And the vnciuill tongues most venym-driuell, Much more I doe confesse it is a spight To be of honest men a villaine hight. But on the other side, when thou consider The sand-blind errors euen of justest men, How much from Gods intuitie they differ And oft when most they iudge, are most mistaken; Dispaire not at their doomes, but in thy hart Blesse God who sees thee inly what thou art. Oft-times the good man credits with his eares Not with his eyes: Therhence if injurie Redownd to thee; the fault being whollie theirs, Farre be it from thy hearts synderisie: Yea rather with a bolt-vp countenance Giue it the Lie, and hardie sufferance. Much more the Villaines obloquie disdaine it As currish crauin against thy Innocence, His Viper-language cannot cracke thy credit A blush-lesse conscience pleading thy defence; His tongue against thy Soules secure estate Fares as a reed against a brazen gate. But if his obloquie be a true Eccho Of thy mis-gouernance and guilty life, Then well I doe aread it is a woe Vnto thy honor, and a slaughter-knife; Wheras contrarie-wise if thou be sound It's but an ayrie, and an idle sownd. Faire then aguize thee with a trim transcent Aboue al flesh and hells indignitie, Embost with gentle Patience, and Content Lamb-like repinelesse at aduersitie, For, sooth I say, and heauen will witnesse it The just mans miserie is a haughtie merit. And first please God in his commandements, Next, with a true Satrapick-sufferance Grace me that face of thine, those lineaments Against Detraction and hells mis-valiance, Shew that thou art the image of thy God In patient portage of his penall rod. So, nor dispaire, nor yet reuenge thy woe But with the prudent Serpent in distresse Safe-garde thy head; let die the rest beloe: Thy head in heauen, thy heele in heauinesse Is merrie matter, if thou well consider That death rejoynes them both in blesse togither. Hast thou not noted this effect in Nature, How chill-cold winter calefies the water Anteperistezing her powers together Wherby it faire resists her yeie ire? So, in thy winter of Aduersitie Create thy selfe a sommer-Iubilie. Giue place to furie as the humble Snaile Retreating in his hornes gainst misaduenture, In time all violence will selfelie quaile If vnprouok'd with currish misdemeanure: The chillest winter and the darkest night Redound at last to Sommer, and broad day-light. See how the Marigold against the Son Displayes and shuts it selfe at his dominion Lessening at night her spred proportion But nere disculloring her gold-complexion, So to the soueraigntie of God aboue With Fortunes night deminish not thy loue. But thinke misfortune is the flayle of grace, The clarifying Fornace of thy soule Wherewith God strips away thy chaffe-disgrace And makes thee pure mettle with such controwlle T'is honorable manhood to obey thy God, Bee't in his mercie, or his justice-rod. Wilt thou submit thy mind to Fortunes Impostes Faithlesse of Gods benignitie and care? Ah, rather doe disdaine her bales and bostes As Crocadyle-deceipts, and crabbed ware: And to thy God alonly plie thy hest For such is pure dutie, and the pure best. So doing, better boones then Fortunes baubles Will Spaniell-like attend vpon thy merite, Good death, and after death th' immoouables Of glorie, and fame, and an in heauened spirite In euerlasting Iubilie and blesse Far more then heart can thinke, or tongue expresse. So shalt thou swim away in Vertues flood, A happie burthen to a happy Maine, Gods flowerie-eternitie garlanding thy good And his embrace lullabying all thy paine: Oh, happy thou when such adoption Shall faire befall thy tribulation. When all thy Crosses shall appeare in heauen As euer-memorable Annalles of thy merit, Or as bright Trophees to thy Vertue geuen The Saintes of glorie all applauding it; When God with his serenest countenance Shall euer bright be-boone thy sufferance. Then wilt thou nere repent the of thy woe But wish it had been twentie folde as much For Iesus sake, who euen in earth beloe Can frollick thy incinder with his tutch And faire be-heauen thy bones in drearie graue, Aboue the glorie and ease that CÃ¦sars haue. And sooth to say, wherin hath Iesus err'd Or not deseru'd such suffrance at thy hands? Hath he not alwayes in his life preferr'd Disgrace and dole to rid thee out of bands? Oh, was not he the man, the Lambe that dy'd To shew thee heauen in woe, and not in pride? He was Almightie to haue sau'd his head If he had pleas'd; But for a president Of passiue Fortitude, and Lamblihead He condiscended vnto woe and torment, And did erect the Crosse a capitall Ensigne of honour, and renowne to all. And since, what Saint did euer amount to blesse That hath not more or lesse been crucifi'd? Either with selfe zeale-doome, or by oppresse Of tyrannie by villaines hands inflicted? The seed that must to flowery growth redound Must first lie dead, and withered in the ground. Besides; oh what a monstrous thing it is To liue delitious vnder a thorney head; Thy God to daigne to die for thy amisse And thou repine to be dishonored For Vertues sake; Oh fond ingratitude So to permit thy Sence thy Soule delude. If so the flesh, the world, the deuill could doe More spight vnto thy state then God can quayle, Or that his grace could not transcend thy woe Be-cheering it with happie counteruayle, Then might'st thou with a just repine detest; To be by any fate of flesh opprest. But God both can and will relieue his Plaintife That doth with just petitions inuoke him, Selfe-louelesse and repinelesse at the griefe That from his soueraigne doome betides him; The louing mothers teat is not so prone Vnto her Babe, as Christ to his deere one. So shew'd his Pellican-content to die To giue thee life, the gore adowne his breast To wash away thy sin-impuritie; His dolour was thy euerlasting rest, His bitter wounds the euer open gates Of grace, and glorie to thy rankest fates. Loe, he thy paines-appease, true charter-warrant Of glorie after gall: The bonnie bright Whose crimson rayes can faire propulse and daunt The dreadest Goblin of thy darkest night: Be thou the man of duty to thy dole, The rest let him alone for to controle. Inshrine thy Patience in his Passion Thy Hope, thy Constance in his after-boones To his entire irradiation Submit thy night-shades and decreased Moones, He is the Sonne of Right, and will appay All vertues anguor with a Hollie-day. Behold his image yonder on the Crosse, See how he droops and dies and damnes Reuenge Yeelding his whole humanity in grosse A pendular reproch on woodden henge: Yea euen his Deitie he doth deject Vnto a seeming shadowed defect, Be not a beast of desperation, A moodie torment, traitor to thy selfe, T'is grosse conceipt and imperfection To ground thy Barke vpon thy owne shores shelfe: Suffice it that extrinsecall aggriefe Abound, sans that thou giue it home-reliefe. Thinke that thy sinnes are greater then thy woe, Thy worldly griefes but Graces happy rescue From greater helles that to thy sowle doe growe; Or haply to enforce to manly vertue Thy youngling hestes of grace; or to containe Thy present good from proouing after vaine. Time and thy graue did first salute thy Nature Euen in her infancie and cradle-Rightes Inuiting it to dustie Deaths defeature, And therewithall thy Fortunes fierce despights: Death is the gulfe of all: and then I say Thou art as good as CÃ¦sar in his clay. Death is the drearie Dad, and dust the Dame Of all flesh-frailtie, woe or maiestie; All sinkes to earth that surgeth from the same, Nature and Fortune must together die: Only faire Vertue skales eternitie Aboue Earths all-abating tyrannie. Read in my front the ruine of my nature And ther withall perpend thy miseries, I doe confesse I were a cursed creature Were not Gods grace aboue m'infirmities, So, thou in Faith to after-retribution Asswage thy woe and tribulation. Die in thy Sauiours wounds, and there an end, There pricke the Period of thy moody wander, To him thy woe, and the reuenge commend As to thy soueraigne Liege and high commander. And thinke no errour whispereth in thine eare For what I say is true, and that I sweare. So said: the teares of zeale trill'd downe his cheeks Attesting truth vnto his Catechisme, When (loe) eftsoons vnto the Crucifixe Crooching adowne, he said; Oh sacred Chrisme, Oh sweet asswage of infelicitie Witnesse that what I say is veritie. Say, art not thou the image of our Lord The true Character of his sufferance? Was he not crown'd, deluded, and abhord Misuail'd, and scourg'd with vile mis-valiance? Oh, was not he the holie Paschall-lambe That di'd repinelesse for the sinnes of man? Sweet (Iesu) giue me leaue to kisse thy figure With thankfull zeale to thy benignitie, And let me pray thee by so great disfigure T'inspire this man of woe thy passiue-glorie: That not all like a beast hee droop and die Heart-lesse and impious in his miserie. Defend thy image from so black a blurre With thy in-shine; Let not temptation foyle So much thy Passions price all like a Curre, But as thou art a President of toyle To after-glorie; so let thy grace fore-goe And faire accompanie this man of woe. Without thy grace my speech is all but aire And barraine Marle; it batteneth not the ground: It is thy grace that foysoneth all affaire That holie grace that floweth from thy wound; I speak in flesh, inuested in my bryer; There is no flame at all but from thy fire. Make it appeare how good a God thou art And how thy woundes were not in vaine inflicted, What Nature cannot doe, let Grace impart To strengthen and inhearten the afflicted, Shew that thy mercie is aboue the bound Of Fortunes topsie-turuie to confound. Let not the fancies of a loftie stile And vaine mundanitie transport thy creature As though alonlie Fortunes lowre or smile Were soueraigne Glories gift and dread defeature, As though thy power were worne out of date And could no longer signiorize our fate. Disperse the terrors of his moodie night That he may see thy shone Hierusalem And in this holie Cittie Sions light Abide, and faithfullie beleeue this Theame Happie they all that suffer for our Lord, For he to such his heauen will affoord. With that he kist the Crucifixe againe And with a strict imbrace therof he sounded; His Ghost amounted vp to heauens domaine, His corps lay trunke-like seeming dead confounded; Whiles I meane while internallie infiered Did feele the woonders of Gods grace inspired. Then gan I credit Catechrysius And hatefullie abhor my former mood, Base Melancholie, black and impious That so distrayd me from eternall good: My heart exulted, and in zeale I swore, Now by our Lord, Ile be a beast no more. I will no longer grudge at vertues toyle, But gladly will be crucifi'd with Iesu; No yron-fate shall heerafter foyle My constancie vnto the Christ-crosse rew: I will accompt all dollour and mishap More deere then sweetest Lullaby in Fortunes lap. No longer will I wander vp and downe The desart of Reuenge, and dread Dispaire, But heer will stint me against mis-fortunes frowne A land-man of this soyle and happy aire: From hence I will reuiue to pristin blesse Or els die heer with Iesu in distresse. No sooner said I so, and gaue consent To Graces in-come, and our Lords attaint, But (loe) eftsoons from heauens high regiment Musicke resounded, and appeas'd my plaint. It was so sweet aboue my feeble frayltie That downe I fell as one content to die. Dying in so sweet sollace and in-heauen I was no more the man of earthly nature, Gods Graces holie rellish, and sweet leauen Had altered my flesh to a new transfigure: Figure of zeale to be in Iesus armes, Condition to endure ten thousand harmes. But God who saw &amp; wrought this alteration, Faire interdicted Death his date-most deed, And sent an Angell from his holie region To cheere my frailty vp to future speed: Whome when I saw and smelt his heauenly hue, It did eftsoons my death to life renue. He then out-stepping from his siluer-cloud Made toward me with a reuerend peacefull pace, And as he march'd euer and anon he bow'd Vnto the Crucifixe was there in place, Whereto at last downe humbled, he kist it, And gaue it me in hand, and thus inspeecht it. Hold heer (Elizian-man) thy Sauiours image The typick Trophee of thy soules redeeme, Be it thy lifes eternall Appennage Thy hearts deere daintie, and thy choice-esteeme, Inconscience it within thy in-most hest For In hoc signe vinces is exprest. Be it thy Standard against all affrount, Vnder her shade tire out Mis-fortunes weather, Be true to it, and make a sure account Heauen is thine owne as sure as God liues euer: God liues for euer to protect and pay His Champion with a ioy-eternall day. And hether I come, sent from his Tabernacle To certifie so much to thy poor frailtie, And heer haue brought thee heauen-inchanted tackle To warfare flesh and bloods calamitie: Loe I thy Angell of protection Against whatsoere foule and fell affection. With that he arm'd my Head with Reasons Helme, The Crest was Vigilance; the Plumes were twaine Temprance against faire Fortunes ouerwhelme, And Patience against her angrie vaine: The Gorget was Content, and either Pouldron Was humble Prayer and Meditation. The Corslet, it was Zeale of Gods true honour, The Back peece, Hope to after-retribution, The Gauntlets, tackles to Charities endeuour, The Vant-braces, Faiths decke and decoration, The Martch, he did injoyne was Penitence, The Combate, Courage against all sinnes offence. Then gaue he me in hand a Shield of Golde All ouer-grauen with Christes Passion, And round about in-amill'd I might behold Death-heads, and latter Resurrection To heauen or hell: The Crosse in th' other hand Was all my Spear against whatsoere withstand. Thus arm'd; the Angell bright againe in-clouded Vpbounded from mine eye toward heauen away Leauing the place with spiced sweetes suffused And all bestrew'd with Crownes and wreathes of Bay, Spelles and demonstrances of future glorie To well atchiued warre and victorie. I then there all alone vn-Angelled, Began to view and glee me in mine Armes Woondring to see me so be-Championed Against th' assaults of sin &amp; Fortunes harmes: And thus I said: Oh shone Hierusalem What woonders are in thee to well-fare men, I blesse the God and Spirit of thy bounds, I blesse thy Concord, and thy Monarchie, I blesse the streams that tril from Iesus wounds Into thy seuen-fold Cesternes; and from thee Are vitally imparted vnto all That liue within thy Rampier and thy wall. Loe, I with Graces furniture faire arm'd Within thy confines, humbly beseech thee Admit my Souldiour-ship as yet vnharm'd With any aduerse warres, into thy cittie: And daigne me there a stand against all euill, The flesh, the world, and fierce insulting deuill. In thee I see how much I went amisse Ranging the desart of mundanitie, And in thy wisedom now I learne this That not in Fortunes false malignitie But in sinnes guilt, and grimme captiuitie Is only wracke, and blacke calamitie. I see my misse in thy faire Phisnomie, My way-lesse errours in thy vnitie, I feele the ardure of true Chiualrie Inspir'd in me from thy Nobility: Heere liue I then the remnant of my age Vnder thy haughty woorth and Patronage. So said; a siluer bell from high resounded Sommoning that Region round about to sacring, When (loe) eftsoons Catechrysius vn-swounded His soules returne did giue him new reuiuing, Oh sacred sommon, sweet enchanting peale That so from heauen to earth couldst soules repeale. His face like PhÃ¦bus in his Noony-shine Daunted my feeble eye at prime aspect, His soules regresse had made it so diuine, Bebrightning cleane away all fraile defect, As had not zeale inheartened my frayltie, I had not had the power t'abide such glorie. He then vp-rising toward me aduanced And kist the Crucifix I had in hand, So done; he said: Sweet Iesu be thou thanked That hast vouchsau'd my prayer to vnderstand; Confirme him in thy grace for now and euer That from thy loue and laud he varie neuer. With that he imbrac'd me with a frount of glee And call'd me brother, and Coparcener Of Christes Domaine, and therwithall he gaue me A golden ring; the poesie was Perseuer: So, foorth we went vnto the Temple-ward Twas sacring time, and musick much we heard. Along as vp the Rocke we footed it He did congratulate my shone in-armor And did expound vnto me euery whit How I might vse it to Gods greatest honor And then concluded: O Elizian See what it is to be a Christian. Wouldst thou haue thought in thy mundanitie That euer Fortunes heel had had the might To spurne th' away to such an after-glorie? Or that thy sorie iourneyment all night Would euer haue brought thee to sweet repose As now thou feelest farre aboue thy woes? The ball out-banded from the court of game, Fals not of force into the duttie kennell, But marke, and often shalt thou see the same Flie in at Pallace-windowes, and there reuell Vpon the royall Mattes, and rich embroader; Such grace of God hath blowne thy frailtie hether. Not all the flush of thy fore-frollicke state, The worship of thy birth, thy rich reuenue, Thy countries high applaud and estimate And all that faire Elyzium can yeeld youe, Is of the worth to countervayle thys hap Fallen from faire Fortune into Graces lap. Say that Eliza is the Lords deere daintie, The PhÃ¦nix of true Principalitie The feast of peace and sweet saturitie Vnto the people of her Emperie; Say that she is both Grace and Natures none-such I bend my knee; and say and thinke as much. For I haue heard the woonders of her name Our coast is full of great Elizabeth, Yea, all the world is fertill of the same; Sweet Name that all mens tongues and pennes inableth, Sweet Sound that all mens sences lullabieth, Sweet Marle that all the world imbatteneth. But such her glories are but eare-delightes And lip-sweets only to our far awayes, For we are no Elizium-bred wightes Nor haue we any such like merrie dayes; Wee haue our joyes in another kind Ghostly innated in our soule and mind. Whom angour of mishap or guilt of ill Driues to dispaire, and selfe misdoomfull deed, Loe, heer th' vnfraught of his woe-loaden will And reuerend riches to his ghostly need; Loe, heer the Arke against the inundation Of Sinne and Fortunes funerall-temptation. Heer (loe) the amitie of men and Angels In vniforme adore of one true God, Heer Peace and Pietie togither dwels, Heer Scisme, and Discords clouen-foot nere trod, Heer sacred Ceremonies are in vre As wedlocke-rightes twixt Faith and Soules insure. Heer chantes the Nightingale incessant praise And prayer vnto the Orient sonne of God, Heer Grace our vncouth Adamisme allayes Stepping her golden foot wher guilt erst trod, Heer Sacrifice and Sacrificer both Gods blesse and good acceptance still sore-goeth. He would haue told me more to this pourport, But that his vp-hill pace out-tyr'd his speech And now were also neer the Temple port Where euerie sight I saw was so heauenly rich As had he vttered more mine eies delight Had quite vndone mine eares to doe him right. Ah, now I want the Muse of Salomon To tell you a Temple-tale, a tale of truth All of the Architect and frame of Sion: To tell you of her age and of her youth And of her reuerend raigne and regiment And how Doblessa rues her high atchiuement. The grownd was Faith; the meane-worke Charitie The Top, a Hopefull apprehension Of heauens attaine: All was of Vnitie A sollid mettle heawn out of Christ his Passion: Yea Christ himselfe was fundamentall stone, And all the Sowder was Deuotion. There shin'd the Rubie and the Chrysolite The sparkling Diamond, and the Emeraud greene, Each Saphyre in their seuerall delight: There was the happie Iacent to be seene The Topasse, Onyx, and many a faire gem, Corrall, Amber, and Aggats were trash among th?. Which such bright rough-cast ouer all incrusted T'was heauen to see what Rain-bowe rayes it yeelded Whiles euerie gem ambitiously contended T'out-stare each others starry neighbourhed: It was ynough t'illumine all the world But for the mysts that false Doblessa hurld. Roses and flowers of all cullored kindes, The Marie-bush and pleasant Eglantine The Honey-suckle in her twisted twines Immixt with Yuie, and the Grape-full Vine, Did all growe vp that starrie spanglement Spousing her splendure with their spiced sent. Below these heauen-amounting swauities Grew ouer all the Temple-greene beside Sweet Gilliflowers and Primroses The Pink, and Gerisole (the Suns deer bride;) The Molie, Violet, and the pleasant Dasie Balme, Margerum, and sweet Coast-marie. There grew the loftie Cedar, and the Pine, The peacefull Oliffe, and the martiall Firre The verdant Laurell in her shadie-shine, The patient Palme, and penitentiall Mirrhe: The Elme, the Poplar, and the Cipresse tree And all trees els that pleasant are to see. All kinds of fruits were there perpetuall The Date, the Almond, &amp; the sauceful Citron, The Fig, the Orange, and Pomgranet royall, The Quince, the Abricock, and the musk-Mellon The Plumme, the Cherie, and the pleasant Peare The Filberd and the Mulberie grew there. Amid these trees, these fruites, these flowerie sweetes Ran in a Maze-like wile a chrystall streame Of heauenly Nectar; in whose sweet floods and fleets Swom sholes of fishes, euerie fishes gleame Brighter then Tytan in his Southerne stage: This streame was strong against prime guiltes enrage. Her silent murmur was so musicall As it dissolu'd the Rock to sand and grauell Whereby it might more in especiall With multiplicitie of eares incell Her musick-sweets: yea euen the earth beloe Did open, and eruct her bowels therto. There sate the Mauis and the Nightingale Carrolling their Layes vnto th' eternall spring The little Larke high houering ouer all: There euery bird did either play or sing, The Parrat for his plumes did most excell But PhÃ¦nix bare away the triumph-bell. There was no sauage shape, no Laruall hue No Bug, no bale, nor horrid Owlerie But all that there was, was sincere and true, Her sweets, her spendure, &amp; her musick-glee; Yea euen the Angels of Diuinitie Were of that league, and Confraternitie. Whiles thus with sacred sollace I suruayd The Temples outward majestie, and heauen, So long on that imparadize I stayd That now the Temple-clocke did strike eleuen: It was the instant time of high Oblation We might no longer linger, but begon. Eftsoons we did so pace-fully aduance That to the Temple-dore we straight arriu'd, Ore which was grauen, Vna, Militans Astile from Vnitie, and Warre deriu'd; The gate was all of pure beaten golde, The Portch a sunnie Zodiacke to behold. Then in we entred, (oh, we entred in) Please God I neuer may come foorth againe: What saw I there? Oh my eyes were dimme My soule, my substance all was poore, and vaine To comprehend so high magnificence; Yet what I can I will you it dispence. I Spanield after Catechrysius foot A happie shaddow to good a substance: All like a flower as yet but in thee root Tending to future growth, and shone aduance: The Temple-porter was a reuerend man And was t'admit in no Elizian. Then ask'd he Catechrisius who I was Who answered a Catecumen hee, With that he greeted me, and let me passe, Such was my entrie to felicitie: The Temple gates were fower and this was it Which none but Europe-spirits might admit. There on my knees my heart was full of fire, Fire of the grace of God (deere grace of God) Which strong bemettled my zeales aspire To view the glorie of that shone abod: It was a Pigion from the Temple-top Which all that frame, and glorie did vp prop. A Pigeon whiter then the whitest Pigion Solie subsistant of his owne pure Esse, His Posse was Sanctification, And Graces bounteous liberalitie; What Iesus erst had planted with his blood This Pigion gaue it grace-full liuelihood. The beames which issued from his brightsome brist Were such as none but Sion euer saw Nor euer could Doblessas dreary mist Indarken, or resemble, or withdraw; Loue, Peace, and Magnanimity in good Patience, and Prudence aboue all flesh and blood. Iustice, and Temperance, and Benignitie, Zeale, and internall Consolation, Pittie, and hopefull Longanimitie, Obedience, and brotherly Correction, Deuotion, and Mortification And firme affiance in our Lords Saluation. Such were the Pigions rayes from Temple-top Which like a heauen of light illumin'd all, It being therto a more secure vpprop Then any lime and stone, or brazen wall: Oh Sion, Sion happie Cittie thow So holie-ghosted against all ouerthrow. Then looking downe vnto the residue I might discerne a reuerend ministerie Of men and Angels chanting vnto Iesu Incessant Hymnes of praise and Iubilie; The high Sacrificator at the Altar Victiming with holie rites his makar. What shall I say of all the maiestie Of all the reuerend rites and ceremonies The rich adorne, the heauenly melodie, The luster, and the precious swauities That there I saw, felt, heard, and vnderstood? Oh, they transcended farr poore flesh and blood. For, what the goodnesse and the power of God In their immensitie could jointlie doe Was there in force sans bound or period, His grace and glory both did tend therto: The meanest obiect there vnto my sence Was more then all the worlds magnificence. There saw I sacred imposition Of hands; and grace abundantly imparted, Chrisme, and autentique Sanctification And Exorcisme of such as were possessed: Their credence and their language was alike All Babell-Biblers they did dead dislike. There was no scambling for the Ghospels bread But what a publike Vnitie diliured The same a prompt Credulitie receiued; Their humblenesse was so beholie-ghosted As Pride had not the power to entice The wisest of them all to a new deuice. Casting my eye aside, I might discrie Selected troopes of people from the rest Dooming themselues with great austeritie Both men and women in discullored vest; They were the people of vowes, and high aspire Endu'd with Graces more especiall fire. On no hand could I cast my liquorish eie From heauenlie miracles and mysteries; Some school'd their Pupils fraile infirmitie Dispencing them Gods sacramentall graces, Some rais'd the dead, and some expulst the deuill, Yet nought could make Doblessa see her euill. How manie Sionits of choise esteeme Braue men of woonders haue beene sent from thence To teach Doblessa (Errors dreary Queene) Their Temples sanctimonie and innocence? How many worthies haue dispenst their blood To doe th' vnkind Doblessa so much good. But she, oh she accursed Sorceresse Would neuer yet beleeue, nor gree their grace But still persisteth in her wretchednesse Warfaring with bloody broile this happy place; Yea, had she might according to her malice Sion had been a ruine long ere this. She was a Witch, and Queen of all the Desert From Babell-mount vnto the pit of Hell, She forc'd nor God, nor any good desert, She could doe any thing saue doing well: Her law was Libertie, her lust was Pride And all good awe and order she defi'd. Erst ere this Temple was established She had no being at all aboue the earth But euer lay in deepest hell abyssed; Why did not God confound her in her birth? Oh, t'was because his Temple might attaine Through her assaults to be more soueraigne. Gods Lambe was now both bred and dead out-right To ransome all the world from sinnes inthrall, And to secure it in more happie plight Had built this Sanctuarie sacramentall: It shin'd so shone vnto Gentilitie That it began to see, and gree her glorie. And as the merrie riuer to the Maine Or the in-ayred stone downe to his Center Fleets and descends as to their due domaine, So it to Sion confluently bent her: Yea, had this hag not been so timely bred The world had all ere this been Sioned. For she could quaintly maske in Sions guize And sucke out venym from the Flower of life, And so retayle it with her subtilties For purest honey: Such was her deed of strife; Her woluish nature in a lamblie hue Shee could disguize, and seeme of Sions crue. Like Ensignes she oppos'd to Sions Ensignes, Like her pretence of grace, and Gods high honor, Like Grapes she did contend grew vp her Vines, And as good Gold as Sions seem'd her Coppor; It was but seeming so, not so indeed, Her seeming-flower was a very weed. For why, the spirit which she did pretend Was not autentique from the holy Ghost, On no authority she did depend Nor had she certaine being in any coast; Her owne behest she did Idolatrize, And Hydra-like renu'd her Fallacies. She had no Altar, nor no Sacrament No Ceremonie, nor Oblation, Her schoole was Cauill, &amp; truthlesse babblement Riot her Raigne, her end damnation; This was the haggard whoore of Babylon Whose cup inuenym'd all that drunke theron. And this was she which now this holie-day Whiles all the Temple was in deep deuotions And high adore of Christs natiuity Came with her barbarous Babellonians To bid it battell, and assault the place; But (oh the foole) she came against Gods grace. She came with peace-full Oliffe in her hand Pretending mutuall honor of that feast: And all her rabble-rout she did command As much in outward fayning to protest, But vnderneath their plausible attire They all bare balles of venym and wild-fire. She was more craftie then Gentilitie Which thought of yore with massacre to quell The propagation of Sionrie: For well she wist that Sion was as a bell And Persecution but as a clapper That made her siluer-sound more far to scatter. Shee therfore to beguile with friendlie seeming Came thus addrest; and priuily intempled Her speciall Bout-fieux to prepare her comming With seeds and weeds of jealosie and falshed: Meane while she stood without the Temple gate Protesting zeale and dutie to her state. But God whose spirit euer Argus-ey'd The weale of Sion as th' apple of his eye, Saw from his high enthrone, and did deride The Harlots complot; and did by and by Inspire his Templers pregnant jealosie And valure against her slie hostilitie. Efts might you heare a battle-bell peale out Religious Larums ouer all the Region And see a solempne confluence about The high Sacrificators holie Oblation: Each one was on his knees for Confirmation In grace against so vile prevarication. Amongst the rest was I a Catecumen As yet vngrac'd with his alhallowed hand, Vntill such time as Catechrysius then Presented me, and gaue him t'vnderstand My Name, my Nation, and Conuersion And how I crau'd to be a man of Sion. Then tooke he mee by the hand, and did applaud Such my PrimitiÃ¦ toward so high resolue, Blessing my on-gate from Doblessas fraud And sanctifying me with a holie salue; He wept for joy that an Elizian Would come to be of his Metropolitan. And for he saw me absolutely arm'd Alreadie to the warres; he said no more But only blest me, and with his breath becharm'd My Constancie against the Babell-whore: And for I was an English-Ilander He prickt me downe vnder Saint Georges banner. Then Catechrysius tooke me by the hand And led me to my Cullors; and as we went He briefly told me and gaue me t'vnderstand How all Doblessas dorrs I might preuent, And then concluded. Oh, that Eliza were A Sionite to day to see this geere. By this Doblessa seeing all her guile Detected and Alarum'd ouer all, Was in a pelting chafe, and gan reuile The name of Sion, and to scale the wall: Loe, thus began the holie warres of Sion Against the rampant Hagg and whoore of Babylon. Then might you see whole Legions of Angels Discend adowne in amitie of warre To Sion, against Doblessa and her deuels: The warre was like as when proud Lucifar Tumulting all the Court of heauen was throwne He, and his complices to hell adowne. Eftsoones the high Sacrificator seeing The vp-shot brunt of all Doblessas broyle Came personally himselfe vnto the bickering To cheere his men of warre in all their toyle: And thus bespake them from the holie Tower, His speech and gest was full of grace and power. Oh men of Sion, happy Machabies, Whom Temples honor in your soules ingrafted Highlie demeanes to Gods benignities; Dismay not at the number of the dead But thinking who he is for whom you fight Redouble your prowesse, and your manly might. You combate for the high Hierusalem A region of Peace and Immortalitie Fore-spell'd, and promist only vnto them That straine in her behalfe their vp-shot constancie: Nor feare yee any woundes or any dying So good a death tends to a better reuiuing. See, how confusedly Doblessa fightes Without all discipline or good array, Her Camp abandon'd to intestine spightes And euerie one contending to beare sway; Their owne disorder will confound their power The frame of Discord dures not an hower. On then like gallants of the holy-Ghost Fighting in Vnity, and for a Crowne Against a rascall and tumultuous Host: Nere let the strumpet pull the Temple downe, No, neuer shall the strumpet pull it downe For God is God, and it is all his owne. Rememorate the glorie of her Age, And of her Raigne, and of her prist in Warres How often hath she quell'd Doblessas rage Attempting to assayle her holy Rampiars? Hath she not been a Nurse vnto yee all A Shelter, and a feast most festiuall? Besides, hath God not promised of yore That hell shall nere preuaile against her gates? And hath not he vouchsau'd to die therfore Establishing her glorie against all Fates? Yea, is not he her fundamentall stone Her daylie Sacrifice and high Oblation? What will ye more? Oh Sionites no more, But to your tacklings stand like men of honor Like men of Sion, one to twentie score Such Babell-hildings; mortifie their rancor With constant and imperious resistance, God and his Angels are in your assistance. So said, he blest them, and dismist them all; Who straight in troops vnto the Rampiers ran And happie he could get vpon the wall: There then a second skirmish fresh began, Doblessa still persisting in th' assault And Sion fierce supplying all default. It was a heauen to see the good array And vnitie of Sion in this conflict, How euerie one was willing to obay His Officers encharge though nere so strict, The holy-Ghost was in and ouer all Cheering their combate with his cordiall. Meane while the high Sacrificator, he Attended to the Temples Sacrifice Offring it vp for peace and victorie, He chanted Hymnes, and Laudes, and Letanies, And in Pontificall Procession He and his Clergie made their intercession. Some in their studdies commented the Text Conferring place with place, and with traditions Ov'ring the fraud wherwith Doblessa vext Their Ghospels peace; some others in her stations Boldlie aduentured their liues to tell The Babellonians of all her hell. Some they perswaded, those were verie few And of those few not one of ten persisted. But still as feare and fraud their frailties drew They started backe againe like men agasted: Oh, what it is to be too secular, It was selfe-loue that all their weale did marre. And of such braue aduenturous Sionites As Doblessa could by hooke or crooke intrap They di'd the death, and suffred all the spights That rage and rascall wit could jointly rap, Subject they were to dreadfull persecution By publick edict, and false brethrens treason. What sacring, and what sacramenting was In Sion all this while for Sions safetie Was more then all the strength of stone and brasse In her defence; God not in enmitie But for her greater glories sake permitting Doblessa thus to bid it bale and bickring. Contrarie-wise, Doblessa ru'd the fate Of her attempt; her mood began to quaile, For God now seeing the prefixed date Of Sions patience in her last auayle Did on the suddaine so enlarge his grace That th' whoore retir'd, and gaue backe apace. And then to shew her latest trumperie (Now that our Lords permission faild her powre) She gan with Magicke-spels and sorcerie Faire Virgin-like to falsifie her figure, Therby to seeme as gracious as she could To Sions eie; such was her guize of ould. But when she saw that all her fallaces And fierce assaults to Sion were in vaine, And feeling now withall Gods heauie furies Showre down vpon her like a floud of raine, Shee could no longer bide the brunt of Sion But backe she reel'd to hell and Babylon. And fearing least her daunted enterprize Might haplie alien her peoples hearts From her obeysance: She so bewitcht their eies With mystes of falsed glory, and high deserts, That they besotted in their disaster Betooke them to their heeles, and fled with her. And as they fled, Oh, marke their vanitie, They did so crauin-cockadoodle it As though they had run away victorie And left faire Sion in her dying fit, Such hoopes, such clangor, and such symphonie And all was but Doblessas pollicie. She nusled them in so proud Peacockrie To th' end they might not see their damned state, But still perseuer as the Bumble-Bee Repine-lesse in their dung, and desperate: Oh, cursed and vnkind captiuitie To be so willing drudge to Falsitie. Yet some whome Sions more especiall beame Had bright appaid to see her dignitie Fled from the witch, as wak'd from out a dreame Of Faery, and Chimericall Imagerie, Such Sion intromitted in her gate Applauding them with deere congratulate. Contrarie-wise whatsoeuer Sionite Doblessa could with slight or fight enthrall She led away into eternall night Blind-folding their eyes to make them fall Into a thousand helles and offendickles, Thrise fatall lapse from Grace into such pickles. Nor was the holie Temple thus acquitted For euer after from her hostill trouble But still as Hydra-like she had renued One head vpon the others stump and stubble She came againe, and made a braggard-show, But still she bare away the Palsie-blow. Such being the ancient league of God to Sion Necessiting her Peace to such temptation And yet withall protesting his protection Therto: against all hell and Babylon: What greater safetie then so good assurance? The word of God is of eternall durance. Thus Sion triumpht ouer moode and tumult Cabaging her Peace in perfect vnitie Against whatsoeuer future-Scismes insult: And seeing now no more hostilitie But all the Region cleere: She fell arifling Doblessas spoyles, the Honors of her fighting. And in her warlike wardrop there she plast them Amongst a world of former pillages And spoyles of Babell: high Hierusalem Sisterlie applauding such her victories, And thinking long the day to honor her With her embrace, and euerlasting cheere. Then (to conclude) the high Sacrificator Came foorth in place, and blest the Combatants, Bidding them giue to God th' eternall honor Of so high hap: And therupon he descants A large discourse of Gods protection How prompt he alwayes was to succour Sion. So done: he efts dismist the multitude T'attend vnto the buriall of their brethren Whom Sions honor had that day endu'd With zeale to die for her like valiant men; Their graues resented Immortalitie Sweeter then all the sents of Arabie. And for it was a speciall victorie Atchiu'd euen on the very walles of Sion, There was proclaim'd a generall Iubilie To be sollemniz'd throughout all the region The Octaue after: in feast-full reference And thanks to God for such his high defence. In which meane while the holie Sacrificer Progressing the Prouince, visited his flocke And with his pastorall care, and Crozier Out-weeded and retrenched from the stocke Whatsoeuer venym weed, or graft of Error Doblessa had sowne, or set with guile, or terror. Namelie; he did especially dispose To carefull cure the wownded Combatantes; And such as brunt of warre had slaine; all those H'Incallendred to Fames rememberance: Lastly, he did repaire and fortifie Each ruine against all future enemie. By this the Octaue-day of victorie Was come; when (loe) the Temples siluer belles Selfely out-pealed to festiuitie; Then might you see both Sionits and Angels Troop to the Temple-ward like swarmes of Bees And hand in hand downe falling on their knees. You may imagine, no you are to fraile To comprehend so high magnificence: There sawe I heauen and earth in ioynt-entayle Homaging to Gods beneuolence A world of praise and Alleluyaes, Hallowing the aire with so thankfull phrase. I saw the high Procession passe along In intermixed rankes of men and Angels The holie-Ghost ouer-hov'ring their song: There sounded Musick-instruments and Belles; Yea, birdes consorted with their warbling lays T'enter-common also in this dayes praise. Along as thus we march'd about the Temple In rich array, in sweetes, and mellodie, A suddaine Zephire-gale blew from the steeple Solliciting our eyes supernally, And what it was; Oh, there I bend my knee It was a Virgin in bright maiestie. The skie did open, and adowne discended Vpon a siluer-cloud this sollempne sight A Mayden-Nymph most shone-satellited With all the Angell-court of heauen out-right: She was inuested in as Orient splender As Gods omnipotence and Loue could lend her. She was the Genium of high Hierusalem The Patronesse of Sion, and the Aduocate Of grace and mercie vnto mortall men; Her comming was for to congratulate This triumph-day and gratefull Iubilie Of Sion vnto God for victorie. Which such her presence stinted our Procession Rapting vs all into a sweet admire Of so shone figure: her irradiation Flaming our spirites with a mightie fire Of Seraphin-affection and zeale To die in vision of her sweet reueale. I may not be so impious and prophane As to compare this heauenlie spectacle To any earthlie pompe, or jollie vaine Of CÃ¦sars Bride: whose pride is but a cackle Or as a shaddow in comparison Of so triumphant and most Virgin-vision. There on the Temple-pinacle she rested Gracing, and doubling our sollempne feast With her in-heauen; And all the while she attested Both with her glee-full countenance and gest Gods euerlasting loue vnto the place And eke her owne against Doblessas race. At last she gan to waue and wend about Our sollempne multitude with all her traine Suspending vs in a delitious doubt Of some sweet sequell: Our doubt was not in vaine, For on the suddaine houering ouer vs She showr'd downe Roses most odoriferous. Roses both red and white adowne she shewred From out her virgin-lap, so sweet resenting As all our sences into sent adiured: So done; she vanisht, leauing vs a scambling For such her sweets; I for my part was one That neuer would giue ouer till all had done. And still I call'd vpon Elizas name Thinking those Roses hers, that figure hers, Vntill such time as Catechrysius came And pointing me vnto his faithfull teares (Teares of the zeale he bare t'Elizas name) He told me No; she was an Esterne Dame. With that I cast mine eye into the East Where yet I might discerne the region bright, Much like as when the Sunne downe in the West Newly discended, leaues vs of his light Some Rubie-rellickes after: Oh, deer God Why made she not with vs more long abod. Rapt with these woonders, wrapt in virgin-Roses And faire be-Sioned against misfortune, I suddainly was gone from these reposes Sollicited with an especiall importune Of home-ward zeale, and of Elizas name, Wherto I bend, and say; God blesse the same.
