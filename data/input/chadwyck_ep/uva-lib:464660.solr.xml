Have in mynd, in mynd, in mynd, secuters be oft onekynd. Man, be war, the way ys sleder, Thy sowle sall go thou wottes not weder, Body and sowle and al togeder, Lytyll joye ys son done. Have thi sowle in thi mynd, The secators be ryght onkynd; Man, be thi own freynd, Lytyll joye ys son done. In holy bok yt ys wreten, That sely soule ys son forgeten, And treu yt ys for to seken; Lytyll joye ys son done. Her ys a song for me: Syng another for the; God send us love and charitÃ©! Lytyll joye ys son done. IV. [Herfor, and therfor, and therfor I came] Herfor, and therfor, and therfor I came, And for to preysse this praty woman. Ther wer iij wylly, 3?? wyly ther wer; A fox, a fryyr, and a woman. Ther wer 3 angry, 3 angry ther wer: A wasp, a wesyll, and a woman. Ther wer 3 cheteryng, iij. cheteryng ther wer: A peye, a jaye, and a woman. Ther wer 3 wold be betyn, 3 wold be betyn ther wer: A myll, a stoke fysche, and a woman. VI. For pencynesse and grett distresse I am full woo; Destitute frome al refute, alone I goo. Whylome I present was with my soffreyne, Ignorawnt I was of dolowr and payne; For than I lyved Fro sorow deprived; Of plesure havyng habundawnce and delice. But now forsothe Sore hytt me ruthe, Fortune contrarythe to my device. For pencynesse, etc. Whane fortune flatery ay deseveabyll, My hert enycyed by prosyrs delectabyll, I thow?t in mynd I schuld ay fynd The whele of fortunat fyxyd fast; Nott for no chawnce To mak delyawnce, Whyle my terme of lyff had past. For pencynesse, etc. Butt now prosyrs glorius be myxyd with gall, Wyche bytter ys and tedius over all; Venimus as poysen, To me full naysom. And from her palyse ryall, Ful cruelly And onavysedly Sche hath soferyd me to fall. For pencynesse, etc. And into gret dole and mysery, Devoyd of all felyce, With her owtrage, Me puttyng to damnag, With hert contrystant thyse wordes I sey: For pencynesse And hyre distresse Fad doth my yoye and wannych awey. For pencynesse, etc. For by her rygurus and crabyd violence, Preventyd me sche hath of my pretence, Constreynyng me to fulfyll That repugnant is to my wyll; For ther as I never entendyd to be abcent, Distawnce of place, Hyherd myschawnce and case, Utterly hath alteryd my purpose and entent. For pencynesse, etc. Schuld I not morne and in hert be sad, Whan slydery cyn, wych never abydyng had, Schuld do me payn By fortuns dissayn, And al memory on me tak away. That the dyseys The hert on thynkys, Wher syght ys nout, farwel thow?t, and have gud day. For pencynesse, etc. Thus my enmye mortale doyth determyne, With dystawnce of place and current tyme Me wyl confownd, And never to redwnd, But me consume and utterly wast; And of al resort Of joy and comfort, Desolate me make and in penurye me cast. For pencynesse, etc. Whome nature excellently hath avawncyd, And hevynly grace gyftes most and syngularly hath enhawncyd, In bewte, in sagacite, In facund spech and in benyngnyte, In behavyowr gudly, me umbyll in spyryt, And sondry wertuse, Wych canot discuse, Frome hym am I sewrd be fortuns despit. For pencynesse, etc. IX. In a blyssefull tyme that mane ys borne, That may fynd frend to trust upon. Every mane in hys degrÃ© Cane say, yf he avysyd be, Ther was more trust in sum thre, Than ys now in many on. This warld ys now all changed new, So many mene ben found ontrew, That in trewth lyven but few Feythfull to tryst upon. Sum tym a man my?t tryst another Better than now hys owne broder; For thei ben fekyll as well as other; For few be trew to tryst upon. And if thou tell a man thi hart, To kepe it clos as ys hys part, Vij. ?ere after it may the smart; For few be trew to tryst upon. A mans feyth ys now sett at nou?t; Sum tym therby men sold and bou?t: Therfor I say thus in my thou?t, That few be trew to tryst upon. Yf thou do by my counsayll, Thynke well on the after tayll; I warent the it wyll the avayll; For few be trew to tryst upon. So many men have bene begylyd, The fader manot tryst hys oune chyld. I am aferd trost ys exylyd; For few be trew to tryst upon. Yf thou doo for a comonte, All that now lyyth in the, Skarsly shalt thou thankyd be; For few be trew to tryst upon. Now no man kan know hys frend, For doubelnese is so mekyll in mynd; Thus in fayth at the last ?end Few be trew to tryst upon. Whatsoever thou thynk to do, Be ware to whom thou spekes unto; For I trow, whan al is do, Few be trew to tryst upon. Now Jhesu that art heyvyn kyng, Thowrow thi moders prayyng, Thou send us all a good endyn; For thou art trew to tryst upon. X. [Thys endris ny?th] Thys endris ny?th I saw a sy?th, A stare as bry?t as day; And ever among A mayden song Lullay, by by, lullay. This lovely lady sat and song, and to hyr chyld sayd, My sone, my broder, my fader der, why lyest thou thus in hayd. My swete byrd, Thus it ys betyde, Thow thou be kyng veray; But nevertheles I wyl not ses To syng, by by, lullay. The chyld than spak in hys talkyng, and to hys moder sayd, I bekydde am kyng in crybbe thar I be layd. For aungeiles bry?t Done to me ly?t, Thou knowest it ys no nay; And of that sy?t Thou mayst be ly?t To syng, by by, lullay. Now, swet son, syn thou art kyng, why art thou layd in stall? Why ne thou ordende thi beddyng in sum gret kynges hall? Me thynkyth it is ry?t, That kyng or knyght Shuld ly in good aray; And than among It wer no wrong To syng, by by, lullay. Mary moder, I am thi chyld, thow I be layd in stall, Lordes and dukes shal worsshyp me and so shall kynges all. ?e shall well se That kynges thre Shal come the xij. day, For this behest ?efe me thi brest, And syng, by by, lullay. Now tell me, swet son, I the pray, thou art me leve and dere, How shuld I kepe the to thy pay and mak the glad of chere. For all thi wyll I wold fullfyll, Thou wetyste full well in fay, And for all thys, I wyll the kys, And syng, by by, lullay. My der moder, whan tym it be, thou take me up on loft, And set me upon thi kne, and handyll me full soft. And in thi arme Thou hyl me warme, And kepe ny?t and day; If I wepe, And may not slepe, Thou syng, by by, lullay. Now, swet son, syn it is so, that all thyng is at thi wyll, I pray the graunte me a bone, yf it be both ry?t and skyll. That chyld or man That wyl or kan Be mery upon my day, To blyse hem bryng, And I shal syng, Lullay, by by, lullay. XI. Aye, aye, this is the day, that we shal worshep ever and aye. A ferly thyng it is to mene, That a mayd a chyld have borne, And syth was a mayden clene, As prophetes sayden herbeforne. I-wys it was a wonder thyng, That, thowrow an aungelles gretyng, God wold ly?t in a mayden ?yng, With aye, Aye, aye, I dar well say, Her maydenhed ?ede no away. Hys moder was a mayden myld, As holy kyrke wytnese and we; Withouten weme sche bar a chyld, And so ded never non but she. A farly thyng it schuld befall, But God hath all women thrall In peynes to ber her chylderne all, With aye, Aye, aye, I dar well say, She felt non of that aray. Hys byrth was know that ylk ny?th In all the lond thorow and thorow; Thedyr thei ?odyn to se that sy?th, To Bethlem that fayer borow. An angell bad that thei shuld go; He seyd that betwene beestys two Godes sonne seker ?e fynd so, With aye, Aye, aye, I dar well say, In a crybe thei found hym ther he lay. Thre kynges ou?t of Ynde lond, Thei cum to seke that ferly fode, With rych presantes in ther hond; A sterre styffely afore hem ?ode. A ferly thyng it was to se, That sterre was mor than other thre, Yt held the course to that contree, With aye, Aye, aye, I dar well say, Thei ded not mysse of redy way. Whan thei with that lady mett, Thei fond hyr chyld upon her kne; Full curttesly thei her grett, And present hym with ?eftys thre. As kyng thei ?effe hym gold so redd; Myrre and sense to hys manhedd; Of hyr offryng thus we redde, With aye, Aye, aye, I dar well say, Thei worshepyd hyme on the xij. day. Mary moder, maydyn myld, To the we cry, to the we call, Thou be owre socur and owre sheyld, Us thou save fro myschevys all. Thou pray thi sonne, that prynce of pees, Of all owre synnes he us relees, Ou?t of this warld whane we shal cees, With aye, Aye, aye, so that we may, Wend with hym at domysday. XII. Now be we glad, and not to sad, For verbum caro factum est. This may I preve withou?ten lett, Whan Gabriell owre lady grett, On hys kne he hym sett So myldly, Thou shalt conseyve this sam day, Salvatorem mundi. A sterre sho?ne thorow Godes grace, As Godes owne wyll yt was; The shepperdes saw in that place Angelles two, And hem among thei song a song, Gloria in excelcis Deo. The chyld was born upon ?ole day, As prophettes to us gan say; Hys moder sang lullay, lullay; Into the est, Therfor mankynd withou?ten end Syng, verbum caro factum est. And than be tokenyng of a starre, iij. kynges ther cam fro fare, And offeryd frankyngcens and myrre To Cryst so fre; Than thei seyd with mery chere, Mane nobiscum, Domine. Therfor pray we everychone To that barne that tym was born, He save us all fro shame and schorne, In pes and rest; And all mankynd withou?ten end Syng, verbum caro factum est. XIII. Alleluia, alleluia, de virgine Maria. Salvator mundi, Domine, Fader of hevyn, blessyd thou be, And thi son that commeth of the, De virgine Maria. Adesto nunc propicius, He sent hys sonne, swet Jhesus, A man becam for love of us De virgine Maria. Te, reformator sensuum, Lytyl and mekyll, mor and sum, Worshyp that chyld that is cum De virgine Maria. Gloria tibi, Domine, Thre persons in Trinite, Worshepe that chyld so fre De virgine Maria. XIV. [Lullay, my chyld, and wepe no more] Lullay, my chyld, and wepe no more, Slepe and be now styll; The kyng of blys thi fader ys, As it was hys wyll. This endrys ny?t I saw a sy?th, A mayd a cradyll kepe, And ever she song and seyd among, Lullay, my chyld, and slepe. I may not slep, but I may wepe, I am so wo begone; Slep I old, butt I am colde, And clothys have I none. Me thou?t I hard, the chyld answard, And to hys moder he sayd, My moder der, what do I her, In crybbe why am I layd. I was borne and layd beforne Bestys, both ox and asse. My moder myld, I am thi chyld, But he my fader was. Adams gylt this man had spylt, That syn grevyt me sore; Man, for the her shal I be Thyrty wynter and mor. Dole it is to se, her shall I be Hang upon the rode, With baleis to-bete, my woundes to-wete, And ?effe my fleshe to bote. Her shal I be hanged on a tre, And dye as it is skyll; That I have bou?t lesse wyll I nou?t, It is my faders wyll. A spere so scharp shall perse my herte, For dedys that I have done. Fader of grace, wher thou hase Forgetyn thy lytyll sonne. Withoutyn pety her shall aby, And mak my fleshe al blo. Adam i-wys, this deth it ys For the and many mo. XV. Make we mery in this fest, For verbum caro factum est. Godes sonne for the love of mane, Flesshe and blode of Mary he nam, As in the gospell seyth sent Johan, Verbum caro factum est. Of joy and myrth now mow? we syng, God with man is now dwellyng, Holy wrytt makyth now shewyng, Deus homo natus est. God and man hath shewyd hys chyld, That hath us bou?t fro the develys wyld; Hym to worshyp now be we myld, Congaudere mihi. This chyldes moder ever more Maydyn she was after and before, And so sayd the prophett in hys lore, Verbo prophesye. XVI. Of a rose, a lovely rose, of a rose I syng a song. Lyth and lystyn, both old and ?yng, How the rose begane to spryng, A fayyrer rose to owre lekyng Sprong ther never in kynges lond. v. branchis of that rose ther ben, The wych ben both feyer and chene; Of a maydyn, Mary, hevyn qwene, Ou?t of hyr womb the branch sprong. The branch was of gret honour, That blyssed Mary shuld ber the flour; Ther cam an angell ou?t hevyn toure, To breke the develes bondes. The secund branch was gret of my?t, Yt sprong up on Cristmes ny?t, The sterre shone and leme?d bry?t, That man schuld se it both day and ny?t. The iij. branch gan spryng and spred, iij. kynges than to branch gan led, Tho to owre lady in hyr chyldbed, Into Bethlem that branch sprong ry?t. The iiij. branch it sprong to hell, The develes powre for to fell, That no soule therin shuld dwell, The braunch so blessedfully sprong. The v. branch it was so swote, Yt sprong to hevyn both croppe and rote; In every ball to ben owre bote, So blessedly yt sprong. XVIII. I hold hym wyse and wel i-tau?t, Can bar an horn and blow it nau?t. Blowyng was mad for gret game; Of thi blowyng cometh mekell grame; Therfor I hold it for no schame, To ber a horne and blow it nou?t. Hornes are mad both loud and shyll, Whan tym ys, blow thou thi fyll, And whan ned is, hold the styll, And ber a horne and blow it nou?t. What so ever be in thi thou?t, Her and se and sey ry?t nou?t; Than schall men sey thou art well tou?t, To bere, etc. Of al the ryches under the son, Than was there never beter wonne, Than is a tau?t man for to konne To bere, etc. Whatsoever be in thi brest, Stop thi mou?t with thi fyst, And lok thou thynk well of had-i-wyst, And bere, etc. And whan thou syttyst at the ale, And cryyst lyk an ny?ttyngale, Be war to whom thou tellist thi tale, But bere, etc. XIX. Make we myrth For Crystes byrth, And syng we ?ole tyl Candelmes. The fyrst day of ?ole have we in mynd, How God was man born of owre kynd; For he the bondes wold onbynd Of all owre synnes and wykednes. The secund day we syng of Stevene, That stoned and steyyd up even To God that he saw stond in hevyn, And crounned was for hys prouesse. The iij. day longeth to sent Johan, That was Cristys dariyng, derer non, Whom he betok, whan he shuld gon, Hys moder der for hyr clennesse. The iiij. day of the chyldren ?ong, That Herowd to deth had do with wrong, And Crist thei coud non tell with tong, But with ther blod bar hym wytnesse. The v. day longeth to sent Thomas, That, as a strong pyller of bras, Held up the chyrch, and sclayn he was, For he sted with ry?twesnesse. The viij. day tok Jhesu hys name, That saved mankynd fro syn and shame, And circumsysed was for no blame, But for ensample of meknesse. The xij. day offerd to hym kynges iij. Gold, myr, and cence, thes gyftes free, For God, and man, and kyng was he, Thus worschyppyd thei his worthynes. On the xl. day cam Mary myld, Unto the temple with hyr chyld, To shew hyr clen that never was fylyd, And therwith endyth Crystmes. XXI. Care away, away, away, care away for ever more. All that I may swynk or swet, My wyfe it wyll both drynk and ete, And I sey ou?t, she wyl me bete; Carful ys my hart therfor. If I sey ou?t of hyr but good, She loke on me as she war wod, And wyll me clou?t abou?t the hod; Carful, etc. If she wyll to the gud ale ryd, Me must trot all by hyr syd, And whan she drynk I must abyd; Carful, etc. If I say it shal be thus, She sey, Thou lyyst, charll, I wous, Wenest thou to overcome me thus? Carful, etc. If ony man have such a wyfe to lede, He shal know how judicare cam in the cred; Of hys penans God do hym med. Carful, etc. XXII. A, a, a, a, yet I love wher so I go. In all this warld is a meryar life Than is a ?ong man withoutyn a wyfe; For he may lyven withou?ten stryfe, In every place wher so he go. In every place he is loved over all, Among maydyns gret and small; In dauncing, in pypyng, and rennyng at the ball, In every, etc. Thei lat ly?t be husbondmen, Whan thei at the ball rene; Thei cast hyr love to ?ong men, In every, etc. Than sey maydens, Farwell, Jacke, Thi love is pressyd al in thi pake, Thou beryst thi love behynd thi back. In every, etc. XXIII. Man, beware and wyse in dede, Asay thi frend or thou hast nede. Under a forest that was so long, As I me rod with mekyll dred, I hard a berd syngyng a song, Asay thy frend or thou hast ned. I ther stod and hoved styll, To a tre I teyd my sted; Ever the byrd sang full shyll, Asay thi frend or thou hast ned. Me thou?t it was a wonder noyse, Alwey ner and ner I ?ed; And ever she song with loud voys, Asay thi frend or thou hast ned. I behyld that byrd full long. She bad me do as I the rede; Whether that thou do ry?t or wrong, Asay thi frend or thou hast ned. The byrd sat upon a tre, With fethers gray than was hyr wed; She seyd, and thou wylt do after me, Asay thi frend or thou have ned. Of me I trow she was agast, She tok hyr fly?th in len?th and bred; And thus she sang whan she show... last, Asay thi frend or thou have ned. Away full fast she gan hyr hy?e; God graunt us well our lyves to lede; For thus she sang, whan she gan flye, Asay thy frynd or thou have ned. XXV. Why, why, what is this whi, but virtus verbi Domini Whan no thing was but God alone, The fader, the holy gost, with the son, On was iij., and iij. was on; What is this why? To frayn why I hold but foly, It is non other sertenly, But virtus verbi Domini. Fiat was a word ful bold. That mad all thyng as he wold, Heven and erth and men of mold. What is why? To frayn why I hold but foly, etc. The warld gan wax and multiply; The planetes mad he full besy, To rowll ychy thyng by and by. What is why? To frayne why, I hold it but foly, etc. The planetes wark no thyng in veyn, But as thei be ordend so must thei reygne; For the word of God wyl not ageyne. What is why? To frayne why, I hold it but foly, etc. Whan Bede had prechyd to the stonys dry, The my?t of God mad hem to cry. Amen: certys this is no ly. What is why? To frayn why, etc. Herytykes wonder of this thyng most, How God is put in the holy host, Her and at Rome and in every cost. What is why? To frayn why, etc XXVI. Of M. A. R. I. syng I wyll a new song. Of thes iiij. letters purpose I, Of M. and A., R. and I., Thei betokyn mayd Mary, All owre joy of hyr sprong. Withou?ten wem of hyr body, M. and A., R. and I., Of hyr was borne a kyng truly. The Jewys dedyn to deth with wrong. Upon the mounte of Calvery, M. and A., R. and I., Ther thei betyn hys bar body, With schorges that war sharp and long. Our der lady she stod hym by, M. and A., R. and I., And wepe water ful bytterly, And terys of blod ever among. XXVII. Salve regina, mater misericordie. O blyssedfull berd, full of grace, To all mankynd thou art solas, Quene of hevyn in every place, Salve.

Gabriell, that angell bry?t, Bry?ter than the sonne is ly?t, Fro hevyn to erth he took hys fly?t. Letare. In Nazareth that gret cete, Befor a maydyn he knelyd on kne, And seyd, Mary, God is with the. Letare. Heyll, Mary, full of grace, God is with the and ever was; He hath in the chosyn a place. Letare. Mari was afrayd of that sy?t, That cam to her with so gret ly?t. Than seyd the angell that was so bry?t, Letare. Be not agast of lest ne most, In the is conseyvyd the holy gost, To save the soules that war for-lost. Letare. XXXI. Nova, nova, ave fit ex Eva.

Mary, modyr, cum and se, thi son is naylyd on a tre. His body is wappyd all in wo, Hand and fot he may not go; Thi son, lady, that thou lovyst soo, Nakyd is naylyd upon a tree. The blyssyd body that thou hast born, To save mankynd that was for-lorn, His body, lady, is al to-torn, Hys hed with thornnys, as ?e may se. Wan Johan ys tal began to tell, Mary wyld not lenger dwell, Thyl sche cam to that hyll Ther sche myth her owyn son see. My swet son, thou art me dere, Qwy have men hang the here? Thi hed is closyd with a brere; Qwy have men soo doo to the? Johan, this woman I the betake; Kep this woman for my sake. On the rod I hyng for mannys sake, For synful men as thou may se. This game and love me must pley, For synfull sowlis that ar to dey; Ther ys no man that gothe be the wey, That on my peynis wyl loke and se. Fadyr, my sowle I the betake, My body deth for mannys sake; To hell I go withowtyn wake, Mannys sole to make fre. Prey we al to that blyssyd sone, That he us help wan we not mon, And bryng us to blys that is abone. Amen, amen, amen, for charite. XXXIV. All that leve in cristen lay, Worshup every Cristmes day. A man was the fyrst gylt, And therfor he was spylt; The profycy was never spylt, Thyl on the Cristmes day. The fyrst day that lely sprong, Jhesu Crist be us among, Ever we thowte it was to long, Thyl on the Cristmes day. It was dyrk, it was dym, For men that levyd in gret syn, Lucyfer was us al within, Thyl on the Cristmes day. Ther was wepping, ther was woo, For every man to hell gan goo. It was lityl mery thoo, Thyl on the Cristmes day. XXXV. Syng we to the Trenite, with parce mihi, Domine. Game and ernest ever among, And among al othyr degre, It is gud to thynke on my son, With parce mihi, Domine. Qwan thou rysyst upon thi rest, Make a cross upon thi brest, I make this song for no vanite, With parce mihi, Domine. Go thou to the chyrche and her thi mes, And serve God with humilite; Aske for?evenes of thi trespas, With parce mihi, Domine.

Prey we bothe nyth and day The gret God in Trenite, Tho henne God theche us the wey, With parce mihi, Domine. XXXVI. A man that con his tong stere, He ther not rek wer that he go. Ittes knowyn in every schyre, Wekyd tongges have no pere; I wold thei wer brent in the fer, That warke men soo mykyll wo. Ittes knowyn in every lond, Wekyd tongges don gret wrong, Thei make me to lyyn long, And also in myche car. ?yf a man go in clothes gay, Or elles in gud aray, Wekyd tongges yet wyl say, Wer cam the by therto. ?yf a man go in cloys ill, And have not the world at wyl, Wekyd tongges thei wyll hym spyll, And seyd he ys a stake, lat hym goo. Now us to amend God ?eve us grace, Of repentens and of gud grace, That we mut se hys glorius face. Amen, amen, for charyte. XXXVII. Nowel, el, el, el, el, I thank it a maydyn every del. The fyrst day wan Crist was borne, Ther sprong a ros owt of a thorne, To save mankynd that was for-lorne; I thanke it a maydyn every dyll. In an oxstall the chyld was fownd, In por clothyng the chyld was wond; He soferyd many a dedly wond; I thanke it a maydyn every dyll. A garlond of thornys on his hed was sett, A scharp sper to hys hart was smet; The Jewys seydyn, Take the that! I thanke it a maydyn every dyll. The Juwys dedyn cryyn her parlament; On the day of jugment, They werryn aferd, thei huld hem schent. I thanke it a maydyn every dyll. Tho the peler he was bowdyn; Tho his hart a sper was stunggyn; For us he sofered a dedly wondyn. I thanke it a maydyn every dyll. XXXVIII. Po, po, po, po, love brane and so do mo. At the begynnyng of the mete Of a borys hed ?e schal hete, And in the mustard ?e xal wete; And ?e xal syngyn or ?e gon. Wolcum be ?e that ben here, And ?e xal have ryth gud chere, And also a ryth gud fare; And ?e xal syngyn or ?e gon. Welcum be ?e everychon, For ?e xal syngyn ryth anon; Hey ?ow fast that ?e had don, And ?e xal syngyn or ?e gon. XXXIX. In soro and car he led hys lyfe, That have a schrow ontyll his wyfe. ?yng men, I red that ?e be war, That ?e cum not in the snar; For he is browt in meche car, That have a schrow onto his wyfe. In a panter I am caute, My fot his pennyd, I may not owt; In sorow and car he his put, That have a schrow onto his wyf. With a qwene ?yf that thou run, Anon it is told into the town; Sorow he hath both up and down, That have a schrow onto hys wyf. XLV. Man, asay, say, say, make thi mone to Mary that myld may. Of all thi frendes sche is the flowr, Sche wyll the bryng to thi honowr, Mary to kall thou hast colowre, Asay, asay. Sche bar Jhesu owr savyowr, Of al myschyfe sche is socowr. Mary is strowne in every schowr, Asay, asay. Sche is cundas full of grace, That spryngyth and spredyth in every place; Mary to callyn gret ned thou has, Asay, say. Hyf thou be put in poverte, Or of thi frendes forsakyd thou be, Mary his lady of gret pete: Asay, say. ?yf thou be aferd of thi foly, Or of thi day wan thou xal dey, Mary his laydy of gret mercy: Asay, say. So gracius and so gud sche is, Sche bryng us al into blys, Ther Mary lady and qwen is: Asay, say. XLVI. Modyr whyt as lyly flowr, ?owr lullyng lessyth my langour. As I up ros in a mornyng, My thowth was on a mayd ?yng, That song aslep with hyr lullyng Her swet son, owr Savowr. As sche hym held in hyr lape, He toke hyr lovely by the pape, And therof swetly he toke an appe, And sok hys fyll of the lycowr. To hys modyr gen he seye, For this mylke me must deye, It ys my kynd therwith to playe, My swet modyr par amowr. The maydyn frely gen to syng, And in hyr song she mad mornyng, How he that is owr hevyn kyng Shuld shed hys blod with gret dolowr. Modyr, thi wepyng grevyth me sor, But I wold dey, thu haddys be lor; So awey, modyr, and wep no mor; Thy lullyng lessyth my langowr. Swych mornyng as the maydyn mad, I can not tell it in this howr; Therfor be mery and glade And make us mery for owr Savowr. XLVII. Hey howe, selymen, God helpe ?owe. Thys indrys day befel a stryfe, Betwex an old man and hys wyfe; Sche toke hym by the berd so ply?t, With hey how. Sche toke hym by the berd so fast, Tyll both hys eyn on watyr gan brast, With hey how. Howt at the dore as he gan goo, Met he with hys neybrys too; Neybyr, why wepyst soo, With hey how? In my hows ys swyche a smeke, Goo ondyr and ?e schall wete, With hey how. XLVIII. Make we joy both more and lesse, On the dey of sent Thomas. Pastor cesus in gregys medio, Pacem emit cruorys precio. As storys wryght and specyfy, Sent Thomas, thorow Goddes sond, Beyng a byschop of Canturbery, Was martyrd for the ryght of Englond. Hys moder be blyssyd that hym bar, And also hys fader that hym begatt! For war we wol beth fro sorow and care Thorow the deth of the prelat. Thys holy mane of God was accept, For what so ever that he ded prayd, Us frome the daunger conservyd and kepte. Of the ransom we xuld have payd. To and fyfty poyntes onresonabyll, Consentyd of byschoppes many on, Thou wast no[th]yng therto agreabyll, Therfor thou sufferyd thi passyon, Of knytes cruell and also wykyd Thou sufferyd thi deth with myld mod. Wherfor the chyrch is gloryfyyd In the schedyng of thy blod. To Cryst therfor lat us pray, That for us deyyd on the rood, Conserve us al both nyght and day, Thorow the schedyng of Thomas blood. XLIX. To blys God bryng us al and sum, Christe, redemptor omnium. In Bedlem, that fayer cyte, Was born a chyld that was so fre, Lord and prince of hey degre, Jam lucis orto sidere. Jhesu, for the lowe of the, Chylder wer slayn grett plente In Bedlem that fayer cyte, A solis ortus cardine. As the sune schynyth in the glas, So Jhesu of hys moder borne was; Hym to serve God gyffe us grace, O lux beata Trinitas. Now is he oure Lord Jhesus; Thus hath he veryly vysyt us; Now to mak mery among us, Exultet celum laudibus. LI. Of the Puryfycacion. Revertere, revertere, the quene of blysse and of beaute. Behold what lyfe that we ryne ine, Frayl to fale and ever lyke to syne, Thorow owr enmys entysyng; Therfor we syng and cry to the, Revertere, etc: Come hyder, lady, fayryst floure, And kepe us, lady, frome doloure; Defend us, lady, and be owr socoure; For we cease not to cal to the, Revertere, etc. Torne owr lyfe, lady, to Goddys luste; Syne to fle, and fleschly luste; For aftur hym in the we trust To kepe us frome adversyte: Revertere, etc. Thys holy day of Puryfycacyon To the temple thou bare owr salvacyon, Jhesu Cryst thin own swet sone; To whome therfor now syng we, Revertere, etc. Farwell, Crystmas fayer and fre; Farwell, newers day with the; Farwell the holy Epyphane; And to Mary now syng we, Revertere, etc. LII. In what estate soever I be, Timor mortis conturbat me. As I went in a mery mornyng, I hard a byrd bothe wep and syng; Thys was the tenowr of her talkyng, Timor, etc. I asked that byrd what sche ment.

To almyghty God pray for pees, Amice Christi Johannes. O glorius Johan evangelyste, Best belovyd with Jhesu Cryst, In cena Domini upon hys bryst Ejus vidisti archana. Chosen thou art to Cryst Jhesu, Thy mynd was never cast frome vertu; Thi doctryne of God thou dydest renu, Per ejus vestigia. Cryst on the rod, in hys swet passyon, Toke the hys moder as to hyr sone; For owr synnes gett grace and pardon, Per tua sancta merita. O most nobble of evangelystes all, Grace to owr maker for us thou call, And off swetenesse celestyall Prebe nobis pocula. And aftur the cowrs of mortalite, In heven with aungels for to be, Sayyng Ozanna to the Trinyte Per seculorum secula LVI. [Nowell, nowell, nowell this is the salutacyoun of the angell, Gabryell.] Nowell, nowell, nowell this is the salutacyoun of the angell, Gabryell. Tydynges trew ther be cum new, sent frome the Trynyte, be Gabryell to Nazareth cety of Galile. A clen maydyn and pure virgyn, thorow her humylyte, hath conceyvyd the person secunde in deyte. Thys is the tewyn for the song foloyng; yf so be that ?e wyll have another tewyn, it may be at ?owr plesure, for I have set all the song. Bryng us in good ale, and bryng us in good ale; For owr blyssyd lady sak, bryng us in good ale. Bryng us in no browne bred, fore that is mad of brane, Nor bryng us in no whyt bred, fore therin is no game. But bryng us in good ale. Bryng us in no befe, for ther is many bonys, But bryng us in good ale, for that goth downe at onys; And bryng us in good ale. Bryng us in no bacon, for that is passyng fate, But bryng us in god ale, and gyfe us i-nought of that; And bryng us in good ale. Bryng us in no mutton, for that is often lene, Nor bryng us in no trypes, for thei be syldom clene; But bryng us in good ale. Bryng us in no eggys, for ther ar many schelles, But bryng us in good ale, and gyfe us no[th]yng ellys; And bryng us in good ale. Bryng us in no butter, for therin ar many herys; Nor bryng us in no pygges flesch, for that wyl mak us borys; But bryng us in good ale. Bryng us in no podynges, for therin is al Godes good; Nor bryng us in no venesen, for that is not for owr blod; But bryng us in good ale. Bryng us in no capons flesch, for that is ofte der; Nor bryng us in no dokes flesche, for thei slober in the mer; But bryng us in good ale. LVII. Nova, nova, sawe yow ever such, The moste mayster of the hows weryth no brych. Dayly in Englond mervels be fownd, And among maryd peple have such radicacyon, Qwych to the uttermost expresse may no thong, Ne pene cane scribull the totall declaracyon; For women upon them tak such domynacyon, And upon them self thei tak so mych, That it causyth the mayster to abuse a brych. Syns that Eve was procreat owt of Adams syde, Cowd not such newels in this lond be inventyd; The masculyn sex with rygurnesse and prid With ther femals thei altercatt, ther self beyng schentyd, And of ther owne self the corag is abatyd. Wherfor it is not acordyng to syth to mych, Lest the most mayster may wer no brych. Yt is sene dayly both in borows and townys, Wheras the copuls han mad objurgacyon, The gowdwyff ful humanly to hyr spowse gave gownys, Wych [th]yng is oryginat of so gret presumpcyon, That oftentymys the goodman is fal in a consumpcyon; Wherfor, as I seyd, suffer not to mych, Lest the most mayster weryth no brych. Nat only in Englond, but of every nacion, The femynyng wyl presume men forto gyd; ?et God at the tym of Adams creacyon Gave man superiorite of them in every tyd. But now in theys women is fyxyd such pryd, And upon them self wyl tak so mych, That it constreynyth the most mayster to wer no brych. But mayny women be ryght dylygent, And so demuer ther husbondes aforne, For of cryme or faut thei be innocent; Butt falser than thei be wer never borne, For wantenly ther husbondes thei wyl so dorne, That owther thei wyl mak hym no thyng rych, Or ellys the most mayster to wer no brych. An adamant stone it is not frangebyll With no thyng but with mylke of a gett; So a woman to refrayne it is not posybyll With wordes, except with a staffe thou hyr intrett. For he that for a fawt hys wyff wyl not bett, Wherin sche offendyt hym very mych, The gyder of hys hows must nedes wer no brych. A scald hed maye be coveryd and not sene; And many thynges mo may be sone hyddyn; But the hod of a syr, ?e wott what I mene, Wych with too hornys infeckyd was and smyttyn, By surgery to be helyd it is forbyddyn. For thei have such an yssue abow the cheke, That it constereynth the most mayster to wer no bryke. Wherfor ye maryd men that with wyvys be acommoryd, Dysplease nott yowr wyvys whom that ?e have; For whan thei be angry or sumwhatt dysplesyd, Thei wyl gyffe a man a mark that he xal ber it to hys grafe; Whobeit ther husbondes honeste to save Clokydly withowt thei obey very mych, And inwerdly the most mayster wer no brych. Was not Adam, Hercules, and mythy Sampson, Davyd the kyng, with other many mo, Arystotyll, Vergyll, by a womans cavylacion, Browt to iniquyte and to mych woo? Wherfor ?e maryd men ordur ?e soo, That with ?owr wyfvys ?ow stryfe not to mych, Lest the most mayster wer no brych. LVIII. Whane thes thynges foloyng be done to owr intent, Than put women in trust and confydent. When nettuls in wynter bryng forth rosys red; And al maner of thorn trys ber fygys naturally; And ges ber perles in every med; And laurell ber cherys abundantly; And okes ber dates very plentuosly; And kyskys gyfe of hony superfluens; Than put women in trust and confydens. Whan box ber papur in every lond and towne; And thystuls ber berys in every place; And pykes have naturally fethers in ther crowne; And bulles of the see syng a good bace; And men be the schypes fyschys do trace; And in women be fownd no incypyens; Than put hem in trust and confydens. Whan whytynges do walke forestes to chase hertys; And herynges ther hornnys in forestes boldly blow; And marmsattes morn in mores and in lakys; And gurnardes schot rokes owt of a crose bow; And goslynges hunt the wolfe to overthrow; And sprates ber sperys in armys of defens; Than put women in trust and confydens. Whan swyn be conyng in al poyntes of musyke; And asses be docturs of every scyens; And kattes do hel men be practysyng of fysyke; And boserds to scryptur gyfe ony credens; And marchans by with horne in sted of grotes and pens; And pyys be mad poetes for ther eloquens; Than put women in trust and confydens. Whan spawrus byld chyrchys on a hyth; And wrenys cary sekkes onto the myll; And curlews cary tymber howsys to dyth; And fomaus ber butter to market to sell; And wodkokes wer wodk[n]yfys cranis to kyll; And gren fynchys to goslynges do obedyens; Than put women in trust and confydens. Whan crowves tak sarmon in wodes and parkes, And be tak with swyftes and snaylys; And cammels in the eyer tak swalows and larkes; And myse move mountans with wagyng of ther tayles; And schypmen tak a ryd in sted of saylles; And whan wyfvys to ther husbondes do no offens; Than put women in trust and confydens. Whan hantlopes sermountes eglys in flyght; And swans be swyfter than haukes of the tower; And wrennys set goshaukes be fors and myght; And musketes mak vergese of crabbes sower; And schyppes seyl on dry lond, syll gyfe flower; And apes in Westmynster gyf jugment and sentens; Than put women in trust and confydens.

Wherfor I syng withowt dysplesans, Of all, etc. Thow that prestes be never so pacient, In towne, cite, or in cowrt ryall; Thow the religyus be never so obedient; Yeit a ill tong wyll trobull them all.

Blyssid be that lady bryght, That bare a chyld off great myght, Withouten peyne, as it was right, Mayd mother Marye. Goddys sonne is borne, his moder is a maid Both aftur and beforne, as the prophycy said, With ay; A wonder thyng it is to se, How mayden and moder on may be; Was there nonne but she, Maid moder Marye. The great lord of heaven owr servant is becom, Thorow Gabriels stevyn, owr kynd have benom, With ay; A wonder thyng it is to se, How lord and servant on may be; Was ther never nonne but he, Born off maid Marye. Two sons togyther they owght to shyne bryght; So did that fayer ladye, whan Jesu in hir light, With ay; A wonder thyng is fall, The lord that bought fre and thrall, Is found in an assis stall, By his moder Mary. The sheperdes in her region thei lokyd into heaven, Thei se an angell commyng down, that said with myld steven, With ay; Joy be to God almyght, And pece in yerth to man is dyte, Fore God was born on Chrismes nyght Off his moder Marye. Thre kynges off great noblay, whan that chyld was born, To hym they tok the redy way, and kneled hym beforn, With ay; Thes iij. kynges cam fro fare, Thorow ledyng of a stare, And offered hym gold, encence, and mure, And to hys moder Mary. LXVIII. O mervelous and blessed nativite off Goddes sonne in divinite. Welcome be thys blissed feest Off Jesu Christ in trinite, That is reformer off owre reste, Lovyng peace and charite. In tyme off peace thys chyld was borne, As it was shewed in prophicye, To save mankynd that was forlorn, Fore kyng off peace he is trulye. Born mervelously he was, Full off blysse and divinite; And she a mayd never the lesse, And so was never nonne but she. In his byrth holy was knytt God and man in his degre, Moder and mayd together were sett, Feith in mans hart ever to be. Therfor praye we to that lord, And to his moder mayden fre, To mak us wisse in wark and word, To praysse and pleasse the Trinite. LXIX. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, now syng we. Her commys holly, that is so gent, To pleasse all men is his intent. Alleluia. But, lord and lady off this hall, Who so ever ageynst holly call, Alleluia. Who so ever ageynst holly do crye, In a lepe shall he hang full hye. Alleluia. Who so ever ageynst holly do syng, He maye wepe and handys wryng. Alleluia. LXX. Ivy chefe off treis it is, veni coronaberis. The most worthye she is in towne; He that seyth other, do amysse; And worthy to bere the crowne; Veni coronaberis. Ivy is soft and mek off spech, Ageynst all bale she is blysse; Well is he that may hyre rech; Veni coronaberis. Ivy is green, with coloure bright, Off all treis best she is; And that I preve well now be right; Veni coronaberis. Ivy beryth berys black; God graunt us all his blysse! Fore there shall we nothyng lack: Veni coronaberis. LXXVI. God that sytteth in trinite, Amend this world, if thi will it be. Vycyce be wyld, and vertues lame; And now be vicyce turned to game; Therfore correccion is to blame, And besyd his dignite. Pacyence hath taken a flyght; And melady is out off syght. Now every boy will counterfett a knyght, Report hym self as good as he. Princypally among every state, In court men thynk ther is gret bate, And peace he stondyth at the gate, And morneth aftur charite. Envy is thyk, and love thyne: And specyally among owr kyne; Fore love is without the dore and envy within; And so kyndnesse away gane fle. Fortewn is a mervelous chaunce; And envy causeth gret distaunce; Both in Englond and in Fraunce Exilyd is benyngnyte. Now lett us pray both on and all, And specyally upon God call, To send love and peace among us all, Among all men in christente. [Bryng us home good ale, sir, bryng us home good ale] Taken from Ms. Harl. 541, fol. 214, v?. Bryng us home good ale, sir, bryng us home good ale, And for our der Lady love, brynge us home good ale.

But bringe, etc. Bryng us home no vele, sir, for that will not dure, But bryng us home good ale i-nogh to drynke by the fyr. But, etc. Bryng us home no sydyr, nor no palde wyne, For and thou do thow shalt have Crysts curse and myne. But, etc. [Women, women, love of women] Taken from Lambeth Palace Library Ms. 306, fol. 135. Women, women, love of women Make bare purs with some men. Some be nyse as a manne hene, ?it al thei be nat so; Some be lewde, some all be shreude, Go schrewes wher thei goo.

Go ye beffore be twayne and twayne, Wysly that ye be not i-sayne, And I shall go home and com agayne, To witte what dothe owre syre, Gode gosyp. For ?yff hit happ he dyd me see, A strype or to God myght send me. ?ytte sche that is aferde lette her flee, For that is nowght be this fyre, Gode gosyp. That everyche of hem browght ther dysche, Sum browght fleshe and som brought fyshe. Quod Margery meke than with a wyise, I wold that Frankeleyne the harper were here, Gode gosip. She hade notte so sone the word i-sayd, But in come Frankelyn at a brayd; God save youe, mastres! he sayde, I come to make youe some chere, Gode gosyp. Anon he began to draw owght his harpe. Tho the gossyppus began to starte, They callyd the tawyrner to ffyll the quarte; Good gosyp. Then seyd the gossyppus all in fere, Streke up harper, and make gode chere, And wher that I goo, fere or nere, To owre hu[s]bondes make thou no [boste.] God gossip. Nay mastres, as motte I thee, Ye schall newyr be wrayed ffor me; I had lever her dede to be, As hereof to be knowe, Good gosyp. They ffylled the pottes by and by, They lett not for no coste trully; The harpyr stroke upe merrely, That they myght onethe blowe. Good gosyp. They sette them downe, they myght no more, Theyre legges they thought were passyng soore; They prayd the harper kepe sum store, And lette us drynke abowght, Gode gosyp. Heye the, tavernere, I praye the, Go fyll the potteys lyghtyly, And latte us dry[n]ke by and by, And lette the cupe goo route; Good gosyp. This ys the thowght that gossyppus take, Onys in the weke they wyll merey make, And all smalle drynckys they wyll forsake, And drynke wyne of the best. Good gosyp. Some be at the taverne onys in the weke, And some be there every day eke, And ellse ther hertes will be seke, And gyffe her hosbondys ewyll reste. Good gosyp. When they had dronke and mad them glad, And they schuld rekyn, theyn they sad, Call they tavernere anone, they bade, That we were lyghtly hens. Good gosyp. I swere be God and by seynt Jayme, I wold notte that oure syre at home, That we had this game, Notte for fourty pens, Good gosyp. Gadyr the scote and lette us wend, And lette us goo home by lurcas ende, For dred we mete not with owre frend Or that we come home, Good gosyp.
