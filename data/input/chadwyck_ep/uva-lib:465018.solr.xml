      <field name="fulltext">THE Fair Circassian, A Dramatic Performance. ?sine Me, Liber, ibis in Urbem. Ovid. TO Mrs Anna Maria Mordaunt. PROLOGUE. Virgins of Albion, Ye fair Female Kind, Who live to Love's soft Measures well inclin'd, Whose gentler Minds have known the pleasing Smart, And felt his Venom trickling thro' your Heart, To You the following tender Scenes I write; To You, best Judges of the best Delight. Thrice Happy He, who could his Muse employ To heighten and improve so fine a Joy! Hence the soft Sex conveniently may find What Pleasures flow from Love with Prudence join'd; What sweet Ideas flutter in the Breast, By melting Lips what Raptures are exprest; How safe the Joys that fill their circling Arms, When Men of Sense are trusted with their Charms. Nor let the Style or Foreign Phrase offend, 'Twas thus those Eastern Beaus their Passion pen'd; The Sentiments were such, in such a Pair, Where He was most discreet, and She most fair: Tho' we may well conclude, from what is writ, The Man had Beauty, and the Woman Wit. Attend! the Lady first shall Silence break; 'Tis thus the faithful Story makes Her speak. CANTO I. SHE. O love! thy mighty Burnings who can bear! What Thirst, what Fever can with mine compare! With Speed conduct me to the lovely Swain That fires my Soul and causes all my Pain; 'Tis only that dear Youth whose balmy Kiss Can mitigate my Smart with healing Bliss. O come, my Dearest, come, and hither bring Thy Lips adorn'd with all the blooming Spring. A Thousand Sweets their fragrant Atoms blend, Which, in a Gale of Joy, thy Breath attend: Such soothing Cordials to my Soul apply, Heal me with Kisses, Love, or else I dy; With poignant tasteful Kisses, such as thine, Whose Flavour far excells the richest Wine. At the dear Mention of thy charming Name, The blushing Nymphs disclose their hidden Flame; While Zephyrs bland the pleasing Accents bear, Perfumes are wasted thro' the gentle Air; The pow'rful Sound enchants the listning Grove, And tender Damsels sicken into Love. Where-e'er You go, where-e'er your Steps You move, Thither I'm hurried on the Wings of Love; His silken Cords my yielding Limbs enthrall, And I must follow my Beloved's Call; But, while such mighty Charms as his invite, My Chains are Transport, and my Task Delight. What wou'd my Prince, my lovely Tyrant have? Oh! whither wou'dst Thou draw thy willing Slave? I see, I see the golden Doors unfold, The Royal Bed, with Raptures, I behold; To Thee my Virgin Blushes I resign, And, spite of inbred Modesty, I'm Thine. Ecstatic Pleasure fills my gasping Soul, As Wines, profusely pour'd, o'erflow the Bowl: O stay, my flitting Senses, and record The Bliss these momentary Joys afford; Yes, to thy kind Endearments I'll be true, And give thy wond'rous Love its Praises due. Ye Tirzan Maids, whose Skins allure the Sight With milky Fields of pure unblemish'd White, My artless Beauties, tho' compar'd with You They seem to fade and give a browner Hue, Are Beauties still, and only look less fair, Sun-burnt and tarnish'd with the Noontide Air. I, of six Daughters was the latest born, My Mother's Darling, but my Sisters' Scorn; My opening Bloom with jealous Eyes they view'd, And fell Revenge their envious Minds pursu'd; Me lonely to the distant Hills they send, Helpless my self, the Vineyards to defend: Where Southern Blasts and Rays of scorching Heat Did on my Face and tender Bosom beat. Yet I, with Patience, in their Vineyards lay Whole dewy Nights, and watch'd 'em all the Day: Ah! Me; my own, but ill secur'd the while, To bold rapacious Love became a Spoil. Rudely He leapt the Mounds, the Fence destroy'd, Nor ceas'd 'till with the budding Clusters cloy'd. Tell me, my lovely Spoiler, thy Retreat; I now forgive; for oh! the Theft was sweet. If You, a Prince, will grace the shining Court, Let Me, your Slave, among your Train resort: Or if, in Shepherd's Weeds, you'll humbly deign To feed your Flock along th' extended Plain; Tell me beneath what cooly spreading Shade At Noontide Hours thy lovely Limbs are laid; Tell me, my Charmer, lest I chance to stray Among the Shepherds' Tents, and lose my Way. HE. O Fairest of thy Sex! to hear thy Voice The Shepherds and their Sheep alike rejoice; Whose Bleatings from the Plain salute thine Ear, And tell the Flocks and Cottages are near: The little Path their cloven Feet have trod Will bring Thee to thy longing Swain's Abode; There may thy Kidlings browze the shrubby Green, And We lie shelter'd in the leafy Scene. How gracefully, my Love, thy Charms appear! How unaffected all thy Motions are! Like Art, thy very Negligences shine, And Beauty moves in every Step of thine. So tread the manag'd Steeds with comely Gait, Harness'd to draw the gilded Coach of State, Whose easy Shapes in just Proportion rise, And gratify the pleas'd Spectator's Eyes. Transparent Pendants, with a Brillant Light, Adorn thy Cheeks and point 'em to the Sight: The Chains that circle round thy Neck with Gold, In stronger Links the fatal Gazer's hold. Haste, haste, ye Nymphs, with curious Fingers ply The Loom, and interweave the various Dye; Let Flow'rs of Silver round the Border shine Mixt with a running Train of golden Twine; With These adorn my Fair, for vulgar Sight; But me her native Charms alone delight. SHE. How my Perfumes, by close Embraces prest, Fly out and hang upon my Charmer's Vest! And, while He banquets at the royal Board, To all around a fragrant Scent afford. But, when in amorous Folds our Bosoms meet, My Love himself is like rich Odours Sweet; Grateful as Myrrh he dwells upon my Breast, And sooths my panting Soul to downy Rest. Who can thy manly Graces truly paint, Or how describe, where all Description's faint! Thy Charms the rest of Humankind surpass, As loftier Vines excell the lowly Grass; Or, as among the twisting Vines is seen The cluster'd Camphire with superior Green. Oh! how transcendently my Love is fair! Beyond all Fancy and above Compare. How languishing his Eyes! like cooing Doves Emitting at each Glance their mutual Loves. Behold, my Life, our dear expecting Bed With Coverlets of lively Verdure spread: Columns of Cedar, of the choicest Grain, In Rows the silken Canopy sustain; Of inlaid Firr the level Floor; above, The vaulted Cieling glows with pictur'd Love. CANTO II. HE A bloom like thine attends the vernal Rose, Such White the Lilly of the Valley shows. As These among the Briars distinguish'd stand, So You excell the Daughters of the Land. SHE. And You, my Prince, so eminently fair Above the brightest Sons of Men appear, As the Pomegranate, with its golden Rind, Exceeds the neighb'ring Trees of Silvan Kind. Under his Shade with sweet Delight I lay, Protected kindly from the sultry Day; His Fruits, with eager Appetite, I eat, Indulg'd my Taste, and cool'd my fainting Heat. Me and my Charmer, now, from noontide Bow'rs, To spend in various Scenes our blissful Hours; Love to the Banqueting Pavilion brings, And o'er our Heads unfurls his trembling Wings. His silken Banner hovers in the Air, And Love displays Himself emblazon'd there. With fev'rish Heat He seizes ev'ry Part, Burns in my Veins, and revels in my Heart. O bring, of cool Sherbet, an ample Bowl, Allay my Flame, and pour it on my Soul; My ebbing Life with spritely Fruits repair, And sooth my raging Breast, for Love is there. Yet oh! how soft, how pleasant is the Bed! When on his Arm I lean my lovesick Head: On his left Arm my lovesick Head I place, His right infolds me with a warm Embrace. Soft, I adjure You, by the nimble Fawns, And Hinds that bound across the flow'ry Lawns, Ye sportive Damsels, that ye softly move, Nor with your Voices wake my sleeping Love. Hark! thro' the Dawn a heav'nly Musick breaks, It thrills my Soul, for my Beloved speaks. Up, like the bounding Hart, He springs, He flies, And thro' the Lattess darts his radiant Eyes: To Me He calls, Arise! Arise! my Fair; Calm is the Morning, and serene the Air; The wintry Cold is gone, the genial Spring Provokes the Flow'rs to blow, the Birds to sing: The wanton Turtle, in the neighb'ring Grove, Sits cooing, and renews his Tale of Love: Behold! the pregnant Fig begins to shoot, The Vine in Clusters yields it's purple Fruit; All Nature smiling welcomes in the Day: Arise, my lovely Fair, and come away. HE. From the cool Grottos of the Rock I hear My Charmer's Voice, and bless my ravish'd Ear. Come forth, my Dove, compleat thy Swain's Delight, And give thy beauteous Person to his Sight. Haste, haste, ye nimble Hunters, spread the Net, With many a Toil the Vineyards 'round beset, The wily Foxes take, and from the Vines Avert the little Vermin's fell Designs: Our Vineyards now their noblest Grapes produce, The ripen'd Clusters swell with Purple Juice. SHE. I am my Prince's, and my Prince is mine, Link'd with a mutual Love our Hearts combine; Among the Lillies He abides all Day, Himself as Fair, Himself as Sweet as They. The Dews descend, the dusky Clouds arise. Night draws her sable Curtain o'er the Skies: Return, my wand'ring Paramour, return; With Me repose, and wait the coming Morn. Fly to my Arms, and, let thy nimble Speed, The Mountain Roe or the wild Hart exceed. CANTO III. SHE. The busy World is husht in silent Night, The Silver Moon displays her paler Light; When sleepless on my Bed I lie alone, For ah! the Partner of my Soul is gone. In vain I send my searching Hands around, My lovely Wanderer is no where found. Inward I grieve, and with confused Haste My Mantle o'er my Shoulders slightly cast; Then thro' the City run, with eager Pace, And seek my Fugitive from Place to Place. Thro' ev'ry spacious Way, thro' ev'ry Street, Officiously I ply my busy Feet. The nightly Watch I meet, and thus enquire, Saw You the Object of my Soul's Desire? They knew not of Him: Scarce from thence I past, But strait I found and held my Charmer fast. Around his Neck my longing Arms I flung, Flew to his Lips, and on his Beauties hung: Then to my Mother's House my Captive led, And fondly drew him to the genial Bed. Ye Daughters of the Land pass gently by, Behold my Love, but with a silent Eye: I charge You, by the Hinds, the Forest Roes, Not to disturb Him in his soft Repose. See! from the secret Bow'r of Love He comes, The ambient Air is fill'd with his Perfumes; Where-e'er He goes, He breaths a spicy Breeze, And wafts ambrosial Fragrance thro' the Trees. Behold his Bed! the Guards around it stand, Threescore, the stoutest Sons of all the Land: Their valiant Breasts are stampt with many a Scar, At Home rever'd, and terrible in War: Each on his Thigh a mighty Sabre wears, To free the Night from false alarming Fears. Pillars, with silver Cornice wrought above, Whose Base is Gold, sustain the rich Alcove: Sweet Woods of Lebanon the Frame compose, The lofty Canopy with Purple glows: The Middle, pav'd with downy Love, invites The Virgin Nymphs to taste it's soft Delights. Approach, fond Maids, and see my lovely King Crown'd with the Beauties of the gawdy Spring, The Garland, his indulgent Mother wove, Against the Bridal Day, the Festival of Love. CANTO IV. HE Your envious Thoughts conceal, Ye rival Throng, And while I sing my Fair, attend my Song. Her dovelike Eyes ten Thousand Charms dispense, Breathing at once both Love and Innocence. Behold! adown her Neck the wavy Locks Frisk, like exulting Kids o'er Gilead's Rocks. Her Ivory Teeth in beauteous Order stand, Like Sheep new-wash'd and whiten'd on the Strand; When, dropping from the Flood their snowy Skins, Each with her Lambs appears, and each with Twins. Her Lips like Threads of Scarlet brightly glow, In sweetest Sounds her moving Accents flow. Her Cheeks amidst soft circling Tresses shine, As when the tender Ringlets of the Vine Around the blushing Fruit their greener Curls entwine. Her marble Neck the sparkling Gems adorn, As blazing Phosphor gilds the rosy Morn, Shap'd like the lofty Tow'r in Sion's Fields, Studded and hung with Warriors mighty Shields. Her Breasts, where Love and all his Graces dwell, Pregnant with Bloom and ripening Beauties swell; Like young Twin-Roes that graze the verdant Meads, With Buds just sprouting from their velvet Heads. Hence to the Hills of Myrrhe I'll haste away, Where spicy Breezes round my Head shall play; There spend in gentle Dreams the gloomy Night, 'Till Morning Sun restores his golden Light. From rocky Lebanon return, my Love, To Hermon's dewy Hill and Shenir's Grove. See from Amana's green and shady Brow The distant Prospect of the Vales below. Securely hence the spotted Leopard view, Nor fear the rugged Lion's brindled Hue. O Maid divinely fair! whose every Part, Like pointed Lightning melts my ravish'd Heart; Fill'd with your Love I scorn the Charms of Wine, Nor for the Vineyard's luscious Juice repine. Your Breath so sweet, that wheresoe'er You go The Gales of spicy Saba seem to blow. A balmy Dew upon thy Lips distills, And every Kiss with liquid Hony fills: With Smells of Lebanon thy Vesture crown'd Scatters reviving Odours all around: The various Sweets which feed the Thymy Bee, My Dear, my lovely Princess, are in Thee. The Garden thus, some Spot of Pleasure, lies, Enclos'd for Privacy from vulgar Eyes; In Thee, each Flow'r uprears it's colour'd Head, Soft vernal Airs the bloomy Buds dispread; Joys ever smiling in thy Glances play, As trembling Streams reflect the gilded Day. Spikenard and Cinnamon, that loves the Vale, Rich Thural Fruits, in Thee, their Sweets exhale; Saffron, with Cassia's orient precious Oil, Supplied by blest Arabia's fruitful Soil, Whose spicy Rind, with smelling Gum distent, Breathes thro' the Air a kind Balsamic Scent: While odorous Dews in humid Vapours rise, And fragrant Clouds perfume the azure Skies. SHE. Awake, O Zephyr, or Thou, Southern Breeze, In gentle Murmurs fan the branchy Trees; With soothing Breath upon my Garden blow, That grateful Smells from every Plant may flow. Let my Beloved, in the cooly Shade, On Beds of Flowers repose his lovesick Head; Or with delicious Fruitage please his Taste, Be fill'd with Joy, and bless the kind Repast. CANTO V. HE. Delights so sweet the Springs and Grottos give. That in thy Garden I would ever live. Where-e'er I turn, enchanting Scenes arise, To glad my Soul, and entertain my Eyes. I came, my Fair, I came a willing Guest, On thy delicious pleasant Fruits to feast: Of Gums and Myrrh I rob'd each spicy Tree, I sipt the balmy Labours of the Bee: For Me the Vine with Purple Clusters glow'd, With Milk the Nut, the Peach with Nectar flow'd: O here, my Fair, for ever let us stay, And spend in Love and Wine the live-long Day. SHE. I sleep, but still my listning Fancy wakes, A Voice informs Me my Beloved speaks; “To thy dear Arms, He cries, my lovely Fair, “Receive me from the dark inclement Air: “The Vapours fall, the drisly Dews distill, “The Drops of Night my Locks with Moisture fill; “Arise, my Fair, unfold the bolted Doors, “Arise, 'tis I, thy Wanderer implores. Alas! the darkning Shades my Sandals hide, My Mantle's negligently thrown aside; Can I now find it? or defile again My Feet just washt, and from the Bathing clean? Yet will I come all barefoot and undrest, And clasp Thee dropping to my warmer Breast. Upon the Lock my Prince's Fingers move, The Sound dissolves my pitying Soul to Love: I rose, I flew with Speed to let Him in, But too much Haste obstructed my Design; O'er every Bolt my wandering Fingers stray Perfum'd, and leave sweet Odours by the Way. But when I open'd, ah! my Love was gone, Tir'd out with my Delay He had withdrawn. Sore on my Mind the Disappointment hung, My Soul Regret and sharp Vexation stung. Again my mournful Voice I sent around, But only Eccho babled to the Sound. Then madly thro' the silent Streets I ran, Hoping to find the dear excluded Man: Alone I hurried on my giddy Flight, Nor fear'd the lurking Dangers of the Night. The Watch, to whom I tenderly complain'd, With foul Reproach my spotless Honour stain'd: My loose Attire the Sentinels descry'd, And rudely wou'd have drawn my Veil aside. Pity my Case, Ye Virgins of the Plain, Whene'er Ye take, restore my wand'ring Swain: For Him I languish, and my lovesick Mind Without his Presence no Relief can find. CHORUS of VIRGINS. How blest, how more than blest the happy Swain! For whom so fine a Creature can complain. Describe, Thou Fair, this Partner of thy Breast, Show us how He so far excells the Rest; O say what Charms, with such superior Grace, Finish his Person and adorn his Face. SHE. His Face with far transcendent Beauty glows, As the rich Standard in the Squadron shows; His Charms such bright distinguisht Lustre wear, Among ten Thousand He'd the Chief appear. A youthful Red with intermingled White Sets off his Features in a pleasing Light; Shining his Hair, and of a Raven Black, In waving Ringlets falls adown his Back: Arm'd with a tender Languishment his Eyes Please while they wound, and kill without Surprize: So soft, and so alluring, Turtles look, That bill and coo beside the purling Brook. His blooming Cheeks resemble vernal Flow'rs, Warm'd with the Sun and plumpt with April Show'rs. His melting Lips like new-blown Rosebuds meet, Bedew'd and dropping with a balmy Sweet. But oh! his fragrant Kisses who can tell! So much beyond Description they excell. Where can his matchless Hand a Rival find? So turn'd the Fingers, and so fitly joyn'd! Rings for Embellishment by some are worn; His finer Hands the very Gems adorn. His Skin, like polisht Ivory, smooth and fair, His Veins like Rows of inlaid Saphires are. His shapely Legs like marble Pillars hold The Fabric rising from a Base of Gold. His Form a Prospect so inviting wears, As crown'd with Cedars Lebanon appears, When with the sloping Sun 'tis gilded bright, And blesses with it's Smiles the distant Sight. Such is my Love, Ye Virgins, such the Swain That gives me Pleasure with alternate Pain. CANTO VI. CHORUS. Bright Maid, ah! whither is thy Charmer gone, And left Thee here defenceless and alone? Tell Us, that we may range the Streets, the Grove, Or Garden, 'till We find the Man You love. SHE. Sure to the Garden He has bent his Flight. For there's his Pleasure and his Soul's Delight; Nor wonder that all Night He revels there, A Wilderness of Spice perfumes the Air; Citrons above and fragrant Flowers beneath In every Walk their grateful Odours breathe: Fruits with delicious Pulp his Thirst appease, And rising Lillies form his Couch of Ease. Happy, if while He views the pleasing Scene, Some tender Thoughts of Me break in between. HE. What other Object can Admittance find, While You, dear bright Idea, fill my Mind. Shou'd Tirza with her gilded Turrets rise, The Landskip paint, and mingle with the Skies; Place but my Fair, my beauteous Princess near, Her Charms the finer Prospect wou'd appear. Shou'd Armies march along in meet Array, Their Spears advance, their Ensigns wide display; Her Eyes wou'd more exalted Glories dart, With more Surprize wou'd thrill the Gazer's Heart. Nourisht by their propitious Beams I live, Yet scarce can bear the Splendor that they give: So shines the Morning Sun with kindly Light, But who can view his Blaze without an aching Sight? Unnumber'd Females, of a Form divine, The soft Seraglio's private Walls confine; Where blooming Virgins ripen to Desire, And bright Sultanas glow with practis'd Fire: Oft, as I sigh amidst the beauteous Throng For All by turns, but not for Any long, From Charm to Charm with eager Gust I rove, Resolv'd to taste Variety of Love; But, soon as I behold my heavenly Fair, My wand'ring Fancy stops and settles there: The Beauties of the Sex I find in One, For She's a Magazine of Charms alone. The slighted Nymphs yet bless Her with their Voice, And Envy's self approves the happy Choice. But who is This, that with Her glorious Eyes, Looks like the Morn, and emulates the Skies? Fair as the Moon, reflecting Silver Light, Strong as the golden Sun, and beamy bright. So glittering Spears that gild the dreadful War With fatal Gleams shine trembling from afar. Down in the Grove of Spices as I stood, To view the rising Flow'rs and pregnant Bud; The Trees in Verdure Green, with bloomy Shade And mingled Light, a lively Landskip made: Yet when Her distant Eyes like Stars appear, My ready Senses start and center there: Wing'd with Desire, my Soul outflies the Wind, And the bright Scene neglected leaves behind. CANTO VII. HE. Her slender Feet, most lovely to behold, Are cas'd in Purple Buskins wrought with Gold; Her well-turn'd Legs and full-proportion'd Thighs Charm by Degrees and with new Beauty rise; The Joints with Dimples smiling; and above, The Spring of Bliss, the bubling Fount of Love. Plump is her Belly, but how smoothly plain! Like Fields of Wheat impregnated with Rain; White as the Silver Lilly's snowy Bloom, Swelling with Dew, and fragrant with Perfume. Her even Breasts like the Roe's Younglings play, And panting bound luxuriant as They: Like Velvet Buds the crimson Nipples rise, Firm to the Touch and grateful to the Eyes. Fair as an Ivory Column's tow'ring Height, Her lofty Neck advances to the Sight. Her Eyes reflect the Fountain's limpid Hue, Clear as the Sky and of a heavenly Blue. Like Beams of milder Light, divinely Fair, Bound back and braided shines her silken Hair. The King, in passing, her bright Form admires, And feels within his Breast soft kindling Fires; Held in the Galleries a Slave to Love, Intent He gazes, and forgets to move. How Fair art Thou, my Queen, thy Charms how bright For Pleasure form'd, and finish'd for Delight: Tall as the Palm thy Mien, thy juicy Breast, Like clustring Grapes, inviting to be prest. Let Me the strait the stately Bole ascend, Grasp'd in my Arms the blooming Boughs shall bend; The clust'ring Vine in my Embrace shall bleed, And on thy fragrant balmy Breath I'll feed. Thy Lips, whose Taste exceeds the richest Wine, Shall feast my Palate and my Bliss refine: This with new Pleasure will our Joys prolong, Make Dullness brisk, and wearied Nature young. SHE. Thy Transports, Love, with what Delight I hear! Such Fondness ravishes my listning Ear. With Thee I'll range the distant lonely Fields, Where the fresh Spring eternal Pleasure yields; Where the low Village free from noisy Strife, Unheeded drinks the real Sweets of Life. There let us lodge, and with the Morning Sun Our Course of pleasing Toil together run; Observe the Vine it's tender Bud disclose, How with young Bloom the new Pomegranate glows: How ripening Fruits in Embryo appear, The grateful Prospect of a plenteous Year. There, on some Bank reclin'd, whilst over Head Embow'ring Jasmines their sweet Odours shed, Clasping and claspt with evertwining Arms, Unenvied I'll enjoy thy manly Charms, Give up my hidden Beauties to thy Sight, And die in Ecstasies of full Delight. CANTO VIII. SHE. Oh! that thou wert, as once my Brother was, Free and familiar to my fond Embrace; When smiling Both, Both innocent and young, One Breast We suckt, and on one Bosom hung. Then, without Shame, I'd publicly employ Each passing Minute to improve my Joy. Grasp thy dear Hand, and with a Sister's Kiss Uncensur'd steal a momentary Bliss: And when, impatient of the raging Fire, A mutual Sense shou'd prompt Us to retire, Fearless I'd lead Thee to my Mother's Bed, And on thy Bosom lay my raptur'd Head: By Her instructed in the Arts of Love, My Passion might with aptest Graces move; While rich Collations, crown'd with cordial Wine, To feed our Flame, like Fuel, shou'd combine. Begone, ye Female Slaves, my Voice obey; Fly, and attend with Silence far away: Perhaps my Love, to Solitude inclin'd, In gentle Slumbers will indulge his Mind. HE. Lean on my Arm, on Me thy Head recline, The Care to guard my Charmer's Steps be mine: Thy Posture now revives the pleasing Thought How Thou wert first to my Embraces brought. Beneath a lofty Cedar's gloomy Shade On the green Turf my languid Limbs were laid, Thy Mother came, and lo! She led along Her dear SAPHIRA, beautiful and young; When strait She gave Thee to my longing Side, And I with Ardour seis'd the blushing Bride. The Rest is past Description; now no more Love was outragious, for his Fit was o'er: I rais'd Thee fainting from the fragrant Green, The conscious Print among the Flow'rs was seen; My Arm, as now, sustain'd thy lovely Frame, Sweet was the Pleasure then, and now the same. SHE. Light of my Life, oh! take me to thy Heart, Nor ever with thy fond SAPHIRA part: Oh! seal me, stamp me on thy tender Mind, And leave the strong Impression deep behind. For Love, like Death, his Sceptre sternly sways, When-e'er the Tyrant calls, the Slave obeys. His Passion, turn'd to Jealousy, will rave Fierce as a Whirlwind, cruel as the Grave, For ever burnt and burning with Desire, As Coals that glow with unconsuming Fire. Let gushing Brooks and swelling Torrents roll Their cooling Waters o'er the Love-sick Soul, Yet will survive the bright unsullied Flame, It's Vigour lively, and it's Heat the same. Ransack the solid Globe for Wealth; and sweep The secret Vallies of th' unfathom'd Deep, Give all to Love and bribe Him to be kind, Yet still you'll feel his Fetters on your Mind: Whate'er you stake, his Value's still above, And nothing ballances but Love for Love. HE. Then, be it publisht thro' the spacious East, How much, how dearly SOLOMON is blest. Shew, how his Palaces and Temples rise, With glittering Roofs aspiring to the Skies; Paint his fair Gardens, and disclose the Groves, The private Scenes of his repeated Loves; The purling Falls of Water to invite Soft Slumbers, and divert with fresh Delight: Describe his Ivory Throne, his pompous State, With all the gawdy Names that sound Him Great: But tell the World that these are trifling Things Compar'd to Her from whom his Pleasure springs, For Grandeur and for glorious Fame design'd To awe the Vulgar and amuse Mankind, Mere Bubbles made for Wonder and for Show; His real Joys from dear SAPHIRA flow. And, lest the dazling Mines from Ophir brought To after Ages shou'd suggest a Thought, That He, who cou'd command so rich a Prize, Might well be blest, might well be counted Wise, Let future Times in lasting Verse be told, His Fair One made him Happy, not his Gold. SHE. Sweet are the Accents of thy heavenly Voice! The Groves are pleas'd, the listning Swains rejoice; The little Birds suspend their flutt'ring Wing, Hover in Silence, and forget to sing. Once more with that enchanting Music chear My longing Soul, my fond expecting Ear. O come, with all thy dear delightful Charms, Rush on my Breast and dart into my Arms: Oh, haste, my Life, and with thy nimbler Speed The Mountain Roe or the wild Hart exceed. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OCCASIONAL POEMS THE MIDSUMMER WISH. ?Quis me gelidis in vallibus Hæmi Sistat, &amp; ingenti ramorum protegat umbrâ! Virg. Written when the Author was at Eton School. Waft me, some soft and cooling Breeze, To Windsor's shady kind Retreat, Where Silvan Scenes, widespreading Trees, Repel the Dogstar's raging Heat. Where tufted Grass and mossy Beds Afford a rural calm Repose; Where Woodbinds hang their dewy Heads, And fragrant Sweets around disclose. Old Oozy Thames that flows fast by Along the smiling Valley plays; His glassy Surface chears the Eye, And thro' the flowry Meadow strays. His fertile Banks with Herbage green, His Vales with golden Plenty swell, Where-e'er his purer Streams are seen The Gods of Health and Pleasure dwell. Let me thy clear thy yielding Wave With naked Arm once more divide, In Thee my glowing Bosom lave, And cut the gently-rolling Tide. Lay me, with Damasc Roses crown'd, Beneath some Osier's dusky Shade, Where Water-Lillies deck the Ground, Where bubling Springs refresh the Glade. Let dear Lucinda too be there, With azure Mantle slightly drest. Ye Nymphs, bind up her flowing Hair, Ye Zephyrs, fan her panting Breast. O haste away, fair Maid, and bring The Muse, the kindly Friend to Love; To Thee alone the Muse shall sing, And warble thro' the vocal Grove SYLVIA. Were I invited to a Nectar Feast In Heaven, and Venus nam'd me for her Guest; Tho' Mercury the Messenger should prove, Or her own Son, the mighty God of Love; At the same Instant let but honest Tom From Sylvia's dear terrestrial Lodging come, With Look important say?desires?at Three Alone?your Company?to drink some Tea. Tho' Tom were mortal, Mercury divine; Tho' Sylvia gave me Water, Venus Wine; Tho' Heaven was here, and Bowstreet lay as far As the vast Distance of the utmost Star; To Sylvia's Arms with all my Strength I'd fly; Let who would meet the Beauty of the Sky. To SYLVIA. Still let us love, my Sylvia, and be wise; Look grave sometimes, but in our Hearts despise The Things which formal Hypocrites advise. The Sun, whose flagging Beams decline at Night, Rises each Morn with fresh recruited Light: But We, when once we've spent our scanty Day, Must bid good Night to Pleasure, Love and Play, And sleep a whole Eternity away. Then, while You live, be constant to employ Each ebbing Moment in the Affairs of Joy; When Privacy permits, and Youth requires, Exert your Strength, and light up all your Fires; Wrestling detain the Angel of Delight, And force a Blessing e'er he takes his Flight. Ten Thousand Kisses let your Lips prepare, The balmy Prelude to the Lover's War, Thick as the whirling Sands on Libya's Coast, Suck'd in Confusion, and in Rapture lost. O Venus, grant thy Suppliant such a Death; O'erwhelm'd in Storms like This to lose his Breath. Or when the fated Point of Time draws nigh, Stretch'd on thy sacred Altar let me lye, Sylvia the Priestess, and the Victim I. As under Ida's Shades, Almighty Jove, Bath'd in the Sweets of soft ambrosial Love, Exhausted lay on Juno's panting Breast, Godlike dissolving to immortal Rest. To SYLVIA. Sylvia, for ever lovely, dearest Maid, With You compar'd, the Lilly and the Rose O'erwhelm'd in Grief recline their dewy Head, Nor This so pure, nor That so blooming shows; In every Clime your opening Beauties bring Flora's whole Wardrobe, a perpetual Spring, Unlock the Tresses of your burnisht Hair, Loose let the Ringlets o'er your Shoulders spread; Thus mix'd We view them more distinctly fair, Like Trails of golden Wire on Ivory laid. So Phœbus o'er the yielding Æther streams, And streaks the silver Clouds with brighter Beams. So finely turn'd your polisht Eyebrows rise, As model'd by young Cupid's heavenly Bow; And sure his fatal Shafts are in your Eyes, Which at the gazing World in sport You throw. O Nymph, to ease your Lover's throbbing Smart, Yield, and prepare for a revenging Dart. Your honied Lips, like fair Vermilion bright, Moist as Dione's with a balmy Sweet, Pouting for Kisses, swell to give Delight, And part commodiously with mine to meet. O come, like Doves, my Sylvia, let us bill, Foin, thrust, and parry with ingenious Skill. But stop! for so excessive is the Bliss, It shoots like Poison thro' my vital Blood, With pleasing Pain You stab at every Kiss, O Gods! and torture while You're kindly Good. Too lovely Maid! regard my cruel Case, And heal Me with a full compleat Embrace. What rosy Odours your soft Bosom yields! Heaving and falling gently as You breathe: Like Hills that rise amidst fair fertile Fields, With round smooth Tops and flowery Vales beneath. So swell the candid Alps with fleecy Snow, While Myrtles bud, and Violets bloom below. Your Speech like Music flows in charming Strains, Your fragrant Kisses with Delight I taste, Your Touch like Lightning trembles thro' my Veins And 'wakes my Fancy to a fresh Repast. Raptures on Raptures, an eternal Round, And Joys on Joys successively abound. If the fam'd Pow'rs such full Fruition share In Transports which their Appetites refine, If Love and Pleasure are the Business there, What Bliss have They more exquisite than mine? Sylvia, like Heaven, does every Sense improve, And melts down every Passion into Love. Heathen Priestcraft. FROM THE First Book of Ovid's Fastorum. I grant that ever since the World began The Gods claim'd Worship from their Creature Man. But then, in Offerings frugal as in Food, Their Altars stood unstain'd with Victim Blood; They offer'd best who practis'd to be Good. As yet no foreign Ship with Spices fraught Had Myrrh and Frankincense from India brought. Far off conceal'd along Euphrates Shore Those balmy Shrubs their fragrant Blossoms bore. Unvalu'd the rich Cordial Crocus grew, Or only valued for it's purple Hue. The Priest their Virtues first perceiv'd, and then The Gods requir'd 'em at the Hands of Men. Before, green Potherbs of good savory Smell, The Product of each Garden, serv'd as well; Or branching Laurel, crackling as it blaz'd, In blueish Fumes the angry Gods appeas'd. Fresh Garlands, woven from the flowery Bank, Were deem'd Oblations of sufficient Rank: Violets, if twisted in among the rest, Brib'd high, and ev'n pronounc'd the Suppliant blest. Sharp Tools to kill and carve the slaughter'd Beast, Were since invented by some Butcher Priest; Who wisely finding that the Flesh was good, Feign'd that the Gods must be appeas'd with Blood. Ceres in Wrath demands the routing Swine, Bacchus the Goat, for nibbling of his Vine. The Sheep and Ox, accus'd of no Offence. Would seem to dye without the least Pretence: But our discreet Divines declare that these Do, best of all, the Pow'rs immortal please, That the Gods leave their Heaven for such a Treat; True; For broil'd Cutlets are delicious Meat. But yet sometimes, to shift the artful Scene, Some Gods are honour'd with a Beast unclean: If all which they requir'd were good to eat, 'Twou'd make Mankind suspect it all a Cheat; Some Rites indifferent must be duly mixt, To Shuffle with the rest, and come betwixt: Thus argues the designing crafty Priest, And thus conceals and carries on the Jest. Therefore a Dog at Trivia's Altar dies; Or a dead Horse may be a Sacrifice; Such as the Persians offer to the Sun, Because He's active and well-made to run. For, whether all the jugling Pranks they do Are advantageous to themselves, or no, The Priesthood still give Reasons for each Trick, And make 'em all significant alike. Gallant Priapus, Gardian of our Fruit, An Ass requires, that aukward heavy Brute. But hear the Cause his reverend Clergy give; 'Tis no unpleasant Legend, as I live. When ancient Greece triennial Honours paid To Bacchus with the Ivy-circled Head, Each rural Deity was made a Guest, And chear'd with mirthful Pleasantries the Feast. Pan and his Crew of lustful Satyrs came, Whose youthful Blood burnt with Venereal Flame: For the bright Nymphs, from every Stream and Grove Assembled there, inspir'd their Hearts with Love. There old Silenus came, in usual State, Astride his Ass, ridiculously great. There the rough Priapus. Patron of the Gardens too With well-hung Ensign marcht expos'd to View; And came where all the Company was laid On mossy Beds beneath a spreading Shade. Their Wine by Bacchus was supplied alone, But each was crown'd with Garlands of his own. A limpid Brook roll'd thro' the matted Grass, At once to cool and qualify the Glass. The woody Nymphs, Part with loose flowing Hair, Their snowy Necks, and heaving Breasts all bare, Part drest, and with embreded Tresses crown'd, Their shapely Legs in Silver Buskins bound, With Lilly Hands, the fragrant Dinner drest, And added to the Flavour of the Feast. The gentle Breeze that wav'd their thin Attire, Fan'd in the rural Gods an amorous Fire. There Pan, his Brow begirt with mountain Pines, Ogling, in Sighs his captive Heart resigns. Silenus too with untam'd Lust was stung, Whose everlasting Lewdness keeps him Young. But stiff Priapus, Warden of the Groves, With Lotis smitten, only Lotis loves: On her his Wishes and his Eyes are fixt, And all his Talk with double Meanings mixt. But Beauty's often temper'd with Disdain, The Fair with Scorn regards her Lover's Pain: She aws the Letcher with a distant Pride, And haughty Smiles his public Flame deride. Now Night advanc'd, and Wine and Revels done, Easy Repose with gentle Sleep came on. The burning God observ'd where, tir'd with Play, Lotis beneath a shady Maple lay; Stretcht out supine upon a grassy Bed, Upon a flowry Turf reclin'd her Head. He rose, and, silent as the Steps of Death, On Tiptoe softly stealing, held his Breath: Till he had crept into the blissful Bow'r That gave his utmost Wishes to his Pow'r. And now, afraid lest every moving Air, Ev'n her own Breath might wake the slumb'ring Fair, The neighb'ring Turf with tender Care he prest; Still lay the Nymph o'erwhelm'd in downy Rest: O'erjoy'd the God her Vesture upward drew, And to the Goal with furious Vigour flew; When the grave Pad of old Silenus bray'd And most unluckily his Plot betray'd. The Nymph was wak'd, and strove with all her Might To stop the eager Dotard's fond Delight, And, rolling sidelong from his hot Embrace, Scream'd out and fill'd with loud Alarms the Place. The Silver Moon, just breaking from a Cloud, Show'd where the God in strange Confusion stood, Too well provided for the Feats of Love, And quite expos'd to all the laughing Grove. For this the Ass was victim'd, and from hence All Asses suffer for that One's Offence. The feather'd Warblers, whose melodious Lay Gladdens the Shade from every leafy Spray, With Love and Innocence securely blest, Might hope to 'scape the bloody-minded Priest. But these they say the Gods command to kill, As Creatures that reveal the heavenly Will; When in swift Flight they stretch their painted Wing, Or when they raise their trilling Voice and sing. Thus from her Mate the spotless Turtle torn Is often to the flaming Altar born. Thus Geese for Io's splendid Feast are carv'd, Tho' once a Goose the Capitol preserv'd. Nor ought avails the Cock his coral Crest, His shining Plumes, and glossy varying Breast, Since his shrill Note, which Wakes the Morning Light, Offends the gloomy Goddess of the Night. Thus says the Priest, providing at his Wish A roasted Goose, that very special Dish. And, to reward his sacerdotal Toil, For him the Cock, for him the Pidgeons broil. THE NAKED TRUTH. From the second Book of Ovid's Fastorum. Of the gay Silvan God that widely roves O'er fair Arcadia's Plains, and shady Groves, That haunts each gurgling Spring, and flow'ry Dale, Where opening Tempè spreads it's happy Vale, Where green Cyllenè rears her lofty Head And streaming Ladon cuts the grassy Mead, Of Faunus is my Song. Assist my Verse, O woody Saint, while I thy Rites rehearse. Rome, for strict Piety of old renown'd, With Flowrets sweet thy verdant Altars crown'd, With Thee her wide Pantheon pleas'd to grace; Tho' now inferiour Saintlings fill the Place. At thine, the giddy People in a Crowd, As now at their Processions, star'd and bow'd. On Faunus' Feast they sanctified the Day With Rubric, Temple, Carnival and Play. But sure their Cult indecently they paid, And Nature's Privacies too much display'd; Uncloath'd thy Priests their mystic Measures trod, And naked honour'd Thee their naked God. Forgive the Muse, if ludicrously bold The wanton Maid thy Secrets dares unfold; If She, jocose, the fabled Cause relates, To see his Clergy cloath'd why Faunus hates. 'Twas Summer; Phœbus, with declining Ray, Began to slope the tedious sultry Day; When Faunus, circled with his horned Throng, On the soft Turf securely lay along. Here from the Chace fatigued, and faint with Heat, Under the Shade he sought a cool Retreat. No sunny Beams here pierc'd the leafy Trees, Which nor excluded quite the fanning Breeze; The fanning Breeze among the Branches blew, And open'd, to the North, a distant view. From hence the goatish Deity descry'd Alcides walking with his Lydian Bride, When starting, with an amorous Look he gaz'd, And while he lookt, her blooming Beauty prais'd. O happy Hercules! he sighing said, Who uncontroul'd enjoy so bright a Maid; Stop, and with one dear Sight a Rival bless, Let me admire the Nymph whom You possess: And You, brown Mountain Goddesses, whose Charms Fade in the Light which now my Bosom warms, No more with ill-plac'd Love I'll kneel to You; Adieu, brown Mountain Goddesses, adieu. Thus, as she walkt, her Air and gay Attire Fed the quick Flames of his prevailing Fire. Her snowy Neck embrown'd with flowing Hair, Like Light in Shades appear'd more brightly fair. Embroider'd Gold her Purple Mantua grac'd, A golden Girdle bound her slender Waste. A gilt Umbrella Hercules upheld, Which from the Fair the scorching Beams repell'd. Now Time, insensibly beguil'd with Talk, Brings Evening on, and finishes their Walk: Hesper's bright Lamp flames in the ruddy West, And shews the busy World 'tis Time to rest. Down the descending Mount they take their Way, And winding Vineyards o'er the Vale survey: And now are at their cooly Grot arriv'd, By Nature imitating Art contriv'd. The Roof with unhewn Pumice vaulted hung, Round the rough Entrance clasping Ivy clung. Near which a purling Spring that down distill'd A Cistern, hollow'd with it's dropping, fill'd. Here, while the Servants, with officious Haste, Prepar'd for Supper, and the Side board plac'd, The sprightly Nymph a frolic Fancy try'd, And drest her rough Alcides like a Bride. A Crimson Pall, varied with Purple Hue, Of finest Silk she o'er his Shoulders threw; Then with her scanty Girdle wou'd have brac'd The ample Circuit of his brawny Waste; And giggled much his Limbs so large to find, As in her widen'd Plaits were scarce confin'd. Her self put on the Lion's shaggy Hide, The weighty Quiver rattled at her Side; Then graspt the Club the mighty Hero bore, Which never felt so soft a Touch before. Thus, for a Whim preposterously clad, They supt and went to Bed in Masquerade: But lay that Night apart, that they might rise Chastly to pay their Morning Sacrifice: A Tribute due to Bacchus the Divine, The Author of all Good, Love, Mirth, and Wine. Now all was husht, for now 'twas Midnight Hour, When Faunus ventur'd to the rosy Bow'r. Love, whose insinuating tickling Dart To Action can excite ev'n Woman's Heart, Drove the hot Lover from his shady Home On dangerous Attempts abroad to roam, Thro' all the gloomy Horrors of the Night, Scorning unmanly Fear and pale Affright. And now, the Entry to the Grotto found, He spread his bawdy Hands, and gropt around. Here first, embalm'd in Wine, the Servants lay, Careless, and snor'd the live-long Night away. The blundring God, his Hopes from hence advanc'd, To find their quaffing Lord as deep entranc'd, Arm'd with a greater Boldness ventur'd in, And thought to act secure the luscious Sin. First, by good Hap, the blissful Bed He found, Which with Success his Wishes might have crown'd. But when will sublunary Creatures dare To trust their Wants with Providence's Care? Each on his own Discretion still relies, And most mistakes when most he thinks he's wise. Thus far the God; who, had he not believ'd His own Surmises, ne'er had been deceiv'd. For when He touch'd the tawny Lion's Hair, The rugged covering of the comely Fair, Struck with a sudden Dread he started back, As when the Shepherd in the thorny Brake Treads unawares upon a sleeping Snake. Then, creeping forward to th' adjoining Couch, Whose Silk with Softness met his gentle Touch, He mounted on the Side that next him lay, His Spear advanc'd and ready for the Fray. But lifting up the Clothes, and feeling there, He found huge Legs all rough with thickset Hair. Surpriz'd, and groping farther, still in vain, His curious Search alarm'd the sturdy Swain, Whose backstroke Fist recoiling at his Head Tumbled the Silvan from the lofty Bed. The Noise disturb'd the Nymph, who in a Fright Call'd up the Slaves, and bid them bring a Light. A Light was brought; which soon discover'd All; Poor Faunus bruis'd and groaning with his Fall; Who scarce could raise his batter'd Limbs from Ground: A Ridicule to all the drunken Vassals round. Loud laught the well-begotten Son of Jove, The Lydian Damsel laught, to see her Love With uncouth Pain distort his Satyr's Face, Asham'd and limping from th' unlucky Place. The God, by Clothes thus fatally beguil'd, His Hopes betray'd, his amorous Fancy foil'd, Hates all Attire; and hence his wanton Priests Admit the naked only to his Feasts. Then, to refresh and purify the Heart, Divines would only view each outward Part: But modern Rome, to scour us all from Sin, Appoints a prying Priest to peep within, Both bent to know the Secrets of Mankind, The Body Those perus'd, but These the Mind. ON FLORINDA, Seen while she was bathing. 'Twas Summer, and the clear resplendent Moon, Shedding far o'er the Plains her full-orb'd Light, Among the lesser Stars distinctly shone, Despoiling of its Gloom the scanty Night, When, walking forth, a lonely Path I took Nigh the fair Border of a purling Brook. Sweet and refreshing was the Midnight Air, Whose gentle Motions husht the silent Grove; Silent, unless when prick'd with wakeful Care Philomel warbled out her Tale of Love: While blooming Flowers, which in the Meadows grew, O'er all the Place their blended Odours threw. Just by, the limpid River's chrystal Wave, Its Eddies gilt with Phœbe's silver Ray, Still as it flow'd a glittering Lustre gave With glancing Gleams that emulate the Day; Yet, oh! not half so bright as those that rise Where young Florinda bends her smiling Eyes. Whatever pleasing Views my Senses meet, Her intermingled Charms improve the Theme; The warbling Birds, the Flowers that breathe so sweet, And the soft Surface of the dimpled Stream, Resembling in the Nymph some lovely Part, With Pleasures more exalted seize my Heart. Wrapt in these Thoughts I negligently rov'd, Imagin'd Transports all my Soul employ, When the delightful Voice of Her I lov'd, Sent thro' the Shades a Sound of real Joy. Confus'd it came, with giggling Laughter mixt, And Echo from the Banks replied betwixt. Inspir'd with Hope, upborn with light Desire, To the dear Place my ready Footsteps tend, Quick, as when kindling Trails of active Fire Up to their native Firmament ascend: There shrouded in the Briars unseen I stood, And thro' the Leaves survey'd the neighbouring Flood. Florinda, with two Sister Nymphs, undrest, Within the Channel of the cooly Tide, By bathing sought to sooth her Virgin Breast, Nor could the Night her dazling Beauties hide; Her Features, glowing with eternal Bloom, Darted, like Hesper, thro' the dusky Gloom. Her Hair bound backward in a spiral Wreath Her upper Beauties to my Sight betray'd, The happy Stream, concealing Those beneath, Around her Waste with circling Waters play'd; Who, while the Fair One on his Bosom sported, Her dainty Limbs with liquid Kisses courted. A Thousand Cupids with their infant Arms Swam padling in the Current here and there; Some, with Smiles innocent, remark'd the Charms Of the regardless undesigning Fair; Some, with their little Eben Bows full-bended And levell'd Shafts, the naked Girl defended. Her Eyes, her Lips, her Breasts exactly round, Of Lilly Hue, unnumber'd Arrows sent; Which to my Heart an easy Passage found, Thrill'd in my Bones and thro' my Marrow went: Some bubling upward thro' the Water came, Prepar'd by Fancy to augment my Flame. Ah Love! how ill I bore thy pleasing Pain! For while the tempting Scene so near I view'd, A fierce Impatience throb'd in every Vein, Discretion fled, and Reason lay subdued; My Blood beat high, and with it's trembling made A strange Commotion in the rustling Shade. Fear seiz'd the timorous Naiads, all aghast Their boding Spirits at the Omen sink, Their Eyes they wildly on each other cast And meditate to gain the farther Brink; When in I plung'd, resolving to asswage In the cool Gulph Love's importuning Rage. Ah, stay Florinda! (so I meant to speak) Let not from Love the loveliest Object fly! But e'er I spoke, a loud combining Squeak From shrilling Voices pierc'd the distant Sky: When strait, as each was their peculiar Care, Th' immortal Powers to bring Relief prepare. A golden Cloud descended from above, Like that which whilom hung on Ida's Brow, Where Juno, Pallas, and the Queen of Love, As then to Paris, were conspicuous now. Each Goddess seiz'd her fav'rite Charge, and threw Around her Limbs a Robe of azure Hue. But Venus, who with Pity saw my Flame Kindled by her own Amoret so bright, Approv'd in private what she seem'd to blame, And bless'd me with a Vision of Delight: Careless she dropt Florinda's Veil aside, That nothing mought her choicest Beauties hide. I saw Elysium and the milky Way Fair-opening to the Shades beneath her Breast; In Venus' Lap the struggling Wanton lay, And, while she strove to hide, reveal'd the rest. A Mole, embrown'd with no unseemly Grace, Grew near, embellishing the sacred Place. So pleas'd I view'd, as One fatigued with Heat Who near at Hand beholds a shady Bower, Joyful, in Hope amidst the kind Retreat To shun the Day-star in his Noontide Hour; Or as when parcht with droughty Thirst he spies A mossy Grott whence purest Waters rise. So I Florinda—but beheld in vain: Like Tantalus, who in the Realms below Sees blushing Fruits, which to increase his Pain, When he attempts to eat, his Taste forego. O Venus, give me more, or let me drink Of Lethe's Fountain, and forget to think. FINIS.</field>
