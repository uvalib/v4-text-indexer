SONNET. When as my minde exemed was from caire, Among the Nymphis my self I did repose: Where I gaue eare to one, who did prepaire Her sugred voice this sequele to disclose. Conveine your selfs (ô sisters) doe not lose This passing tyme which hasteth fast away: And thow who wrytes in stately verse and prose, This glorious Kings immortall gloire display. Tell how he doeth in tender yearis essay Aboue his age with skill our arts to blaise. Tell how he doeth with gratitude repay The crowne he wan for his deserued praise. Tell how of Ioue, of Mars, but more of God. The gloire and grace he hath proclaimed abrod. M. W. F. II. SONNET The Muses nyne haue not reueald to me What sacred seedes are in their gardens sowne, Nor how their Salust gaines the Laurer tre Which throw thy toyle in Brittain gro?d is grown; But sith they se thy trauell treuly showne In verteus skoole th' expyring tyme to spend, So haue they to his hienes made it knowne, Whose Princely power may dewly the defend. Then yow that on the Holy mount depend In christall ayr, and drinks the cleared spring Of Poetrie, I do yow recommend To the protection of this godly King, VVho for his verteus and his gifts deuyne Is only Monark of the Muses nyne. FINIS. M. V. F. III. SONET TO THE ONELY ROYAL POET. Whereshall the limits lye of all your fame? Where shall the borders be of your renowne? In East? or where the Sunne again goeth down? Or shall the fixed Poles impale the same? Where shall the pillars which your praise proclaime Or Trophees stand, of that exspected crowne? The Monarch first, of that triumphant towne Reuiues in you, by you renewes his name. For that which he performd in battels bold, To vs his bookes with wonders doth vnfold. So we of you far more conceaue in minde, As by your verse we plainelie (Sir) may see. You shall the writer and the worker be, For to absolue that CÆSAR left behinde. M. W. Fovler. Mufa Cœlo beat. IV. EPITAPHE VPON THE DEATH OF SIR IOHN SEton of Barns Knight, ane of the Lords of our Soueranes privie Counsell and Session. To win in heaven, perpetuall praise and prise, And that this Land, shuld seik and sigh for thee: Yea, that our joies, even by thy death might dee, Heir with thy corps, our confort also lies, No private losse, bot publik all men spies. And in this wrack, thair ruine dois foresee: Whiles that the better sort; by heauens decree Defaced are, quhais fame filles Earth, and Skies. Thou rests with God, quha was belou'd of Kings, And graced in their Court, quhais grace thou was, The Pyrenees, nor Alpes, not bounds these things, Quhilk from thy vertuous valiant mind did pas. The limmits be the Polles of South and North: With Ibere, Garon, Seine, Rhein, Thames and Forth. ABIIT NON OBIIT. M. W. F. V. AN EPITAPHE VPON THE DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONO- rable, M. Robert Bowes Esquire, Thesaurer of Barwick: who ended this life, the sixteenth of November, 1597. Being at that present Ambassadour for the Queenes Majestie, to the King of Scotland. Bvilde vp, O England! Statuaes, Arches BOWES, And Tombes, and Pillers, to his liuing fame, Who was the wisdome of the valiant BOWES, And solide honour, of that ancient name. And you white Swannes, of Thames, and Tweide, proclame Your grieuous losses, and his high desert, Who both his courses, and his cares did frame, All dangers from your bankes aye to divert. He lou'd his Queene, and crowne, with vpright heart: Postponing private wealth, to publicke weale: He all his thoughts, and counsels did convert: To peace For CHVRCH, &amp; for the STATE with zeale. And now at last, hath pearst the heauens a-laft, Whose bodie was the BOWE, and Soule the SHAFT. The Raine-Bowes now of peace, are cloudes vn-cleare: And Concordes mouth, now speachlesse lyes alace, Yea Englands MERCVRE, passing MERCVRES sphære, By grace hath gone, to the EMPERIALL place. Where neither bounds, nor limits, endes, nor space, Nor was, nor shall, nor time to come, or past: But all in presence are, before his face: Who was the MAKER first, and MOVER last. Why then should I, such projects seeme to cast? To make him famous, who is elles divine. (Whose soule with heauenly MANNA is repast, To whom the Lord, doth lasting crownes propine.) Or yet him offer? which he doth not craue, In making TEARES his TOMBE, &amp; GRIEFS his GRAVE. Abiit Non Obiit. By M. WILLIAM FOWLER Secretarie to the Queenes Majestie of Scotland. VI. A FVNERAL SONET, Written vpon the death of the Honorable, and maist vertuous Gentlewoman, Elizabeth Dovvglas, spouse to M. Samvell Cobvvrne Laird of Temple-Hall. If vertue could haue died, here vertue lies, If Bewtie, Bountie, and vnspotted fame, If euer glorie, glorifieng a dame, Could be deforst, here death his forces tries. O! with quhat eyes? quhat teares? or with quhat cries? Might I lament this losse, and Clotho blame. Eyes, pearse the Heauens. Cries, sound throgh earth her name. Teares dimme the air through woe, and cloud the Skies. To the chaste Dame, the Heauens dois serue for graue: Thy Funeralles my Muse with heauie tone Shall celebrate, and sound in all mens eares: This doth thy vertue, and thine honour craue. Though carelesse thou, how euer this be done. Quha sitts in Heauen, and smyles to see my teares. ABIIT, NON OBIIT. M. W. F.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE TRIVMPHS OF PETRARKE This text is taken from H. W. Meikle's transcription of the Drummond manuscript. Some sections of the text are repeated in the Hawthornden manuscript but these have not been reproduced here. To the right honorable and most verteous Ladve Ieane Fleming, Ladye Thirlstaine, spous to the right honorable Sir Iohne Maetland, Knight, prencipall Secretair to the King his Ma.??? and great Chancellar of Scotland. Sonnet to the authoure. We finde by prwif that into euerie aige In phœbus art sum glistring starr did shyne, Who, worthye Scollaris to the muses saige, Fulfild thair countreis with thair works dewyne: So Homer was a sounding trumpet fyne Amangst the Greikis into his learned dayes; So Virgill was amongst the Romans syne A spreit sublimed, a pillar of thair prayse; So loftye Petrark his renoun did blayse In tounge Italique in a sugred style, and to the circled skyes his name did rayse; For he by poems that he did compyle Led in Triumphe lowe, chaistnes, death, and fame; bot thow triumphs ouer Petrarchs propper name. I. Rex. E. D. in praise of M.? W.? Foular her freind. The glorious greiks dois praise thair Homers quill, And citeis sevin dois strywe quhair he was borne; The Latins dois of Virgill vant at will, And Sulmo thinks her Ouid dois adorne; The Spanzoll laughs (sawe Lucan) all to scorne, And France for Ronsard stands and settis him owt; The better sort for Bartas blawis the horne, And Ingland thinks thair Surrye first but dout. To praise thair owen these countreis gois about: Italians lykes Petrarchas noble grace, Who well deserwis first place amangs that rout. Bot Foular, thow dois now thame all deface, No vanting grece nor Romane now will strywe; Thay all do yeild Sen foular doith arrywe. E. D. in commendatioun of the authour and of his choise. When Alexander entered Phrygian land, Achilles toumbe he weping did behoulde: O happie wight who suche a trumpet fand! And happie thow who hes his verteuis toulde! Than happie Laura, thow by fame inroulde! And happ to the, o petrarch, dois befall: Thye glorie shee, hir praise thow dois vnfoulde. How may thye fame, o Foular, than be small, Who sings Dame Lauras praise, but feinzeit all? This vertewis Dame, to quhome thy work thow gevis, To hir of right These triumphs sing thow sall: No Laura heir, bot Ladye Ieane it is. O Ladye liwe! thy foular the extolls, Whose golden pen thy name in fame Inrolls. Sonnet in M.? W.? Foulars commendatioun. I saw ones all the Muses in my thought, With poets als bedeckt in scarlet gownes; before with sacred troupe Mercurius brought A youth vpon whose face was yet bot downes; Thair saw I thame present him laurell crownes: And with the rest the Toscan Petrarch came, Who said: “my Sonne, receawe these right renownes As he who dewlie dois deserve the same; Bot more triumphant hes thow maid thy name Vpon the Throne of Memorie to stand To chwise for Patron suche a worthye dame, Who onely Is the Laura of this land.” Than Fowlars laude so lowde I herd them sound, That through the world his praise sall ay rebound. Ro. Hudsoun. In commendatioun of the Translatour and the Ladye to whome thir Triumphs ar derected. If pithye Petrarch wha thir Poemes pend Hes purchest prayse promulgat ells by fame, Reviving her quhais lyfe by death twik end, And after death triumphant maid her name, Than Poetts prease his Triumphe to proclame, Whaise compast course conducted hes with cair From Florence heir, and fraughted Petrarch hame, Deckt with his Dames ascending in the air, Into triumphe; and to augment It mair, To yow, madame, thir Dames be all derect, Wha (ane) including all thair vertewis rair, Is with Triumphe abowe them all erect: As Petrarch plaist triumphing heir we sie, So Foular self, and yow, Madame, all thrie. M. R. Cokburne. Ane Summarye and a Sonett vpon the Triumphs and the Translatour. If conquering Cupid, captane of Renoune, Who chaines his captiwes to his chariot bright, By Chastetie is chaist and beaten doune, And by her vertew spoyled is of might; If deathe, the daunter of the humane wight, Triumphe vpon that Dame and doeth hir thrall, Surviving Fame clames bot hir propper right To liue through land or lak as doth befall: Bot thow, O Tyme, that long and short we call, The Triumphe of the rest thow wouldest retane, Wer not Eternitie confounds tham all, as nothing more Triumphant may remane. Than what abyds to Fowlar thame hes pend?— Eternitie, to which he dois pretend. Th. Hudsoun. [When matcheles Homere his Achilles sings] When matcheles Homere his Achilles sings, Achilles onely meaning to decore, Him selfe to greater prayse by praysing brings, And so begetts by geving all his glore; So Fouler æternised hes his name With noble Petrarch and his Laura's fame A. Coluille. The first triumphe of Loue. The Argument. Oure famous and morall Poet in these his morall Triumphs purposeth to descrywe the dywerss states and conditionis of Man, who being formed mortall is indowed with two principall powers and faculteis: The one is a sensuall appetite, the other is a naturall reasoun; The one of these haveing soveraintie in his youthe at that tyme when the senses hes most force and vigeur, The other agane when youth and lustines decayeth; Who, being deid, yit hes his memorie surviving by his famous actis through a more and longer Fame, which at last, evin as all other things vnder heaven, is ouercummed and vanquhished by Tyme which intoumbeth Fame in an eternall obliuioun; Yit seing that turning tyme is a thing bounded, limited, and in it self finit, dois remane subdewed by Immoweable Immortalitie, be whose ayd and help Fame is delyvered from the Iniurie of consuming tyme, dois liue as fermour in the revenewis and possessionis of Eternitie; For whiche causs The first Triumphe of our sensuall parts and youthlie affectioun is decyphered by Lowe. The seconde is of Reason, when we by more rypar and mature aige with the wings of discretioun dois subdew our affectioun; And this Is figured vnder the name of Chastetie in the Persoun of his ladye Laura. The thrid is of death, who defaces all the operationis of our appetite and power of our reasoun which wer wonnt to be wrought during our lyfetyme. The fourt is of fame, when men after thair death recreasis and refloorishis thair renoune. The fyift is of Tyme, that suppressis and extinguishis the same. The sext and last Is of Immortalitie, that ouercummeth all tyme, becaus of things that ar infinit thair is no proportioun. It is more to be noted that these first two Triumphs of Lowe and chastetie ar in this lyfe the thrid, when our saule is in departing from our bodye, and the other thrie after it is frie of the same. Which sex Triumphs our Poet dois depaint partlye by visioun, partlye by Imaginatioun, particularlye interlaceinge the discourse of his estait and his ladeyis, and how her chastetie ouercame him, and agane death hir, yit how by fame she reviveth agane, when although that Tyme dois prease to dark the glorye of hir famous name, yit shall it be through Immortalitie Eternall.

That tyme that did my sobbing sobbs and sorye sighs renew, Through sweitt rememberance of that day on which my lowe first grew, Which was the first beginnar of my panis and future smart, and of my longsome martyrdome that martered had my hart, The Sunn alreddye warmed had the Bull his doubled horne, and Tithus wyfe, Aurora cleir, vprysing reade at morne, All ycye and most frostye lyk had then hir selff adrest vnto hir wonnted ancient place, hir auld frequented rest; Lowe, greif, disdanis, and planing plaintis, and seasoun of the ?eir had caused me to a secreit place my self for to reteir, Whair all the causis and fashereis that did oppres my hart might thairby all affected be and all my doole auert. Thair on the grass and plesant grene, my voyce be plaints maid waik, my watching eyne orcumd through sleip at lenth sum rest did tak: Quhair then I saw a Meruellous light, and in the same muche wo, with litill Ioy, and sadnes full, and as me seamed, lo! Amidst thairof I saw a duke, victorious, high of might, Lyk on who to the capitoll triumphs in chariot bright. Than I who was not muche acquent with such vnquented sight, evin through this noysum wicked world so full of craft and slight, In whiche to long I liwe, alace, and it of valeur voyde, bot full of pryde, of graces bair, which vertew hes destroyde, The habit proude, vnsene, vnvsd, all new and vn acquent, I thair beheld with cairfull eyes both heavie tyrd and faint; Through lingring lowe and drowsie sleip this sight I did discerne, for that I had no other ioy than such a sight to lerne. Thair than I saw four coursers fair, more whyte than anye snaw, a chyldish boy and youngling raw in fyrie chair to draw, Who in his hand his bow did beare, his arrowes be his syde, as nother helmet nor yit targe thair pearceing shottis can byde; Abowe his shoulders ther wer plaist twoe fleing feddered wings, Imbrowdered with Ten thousand hewis, all bair in other things; And round about him thair did stand and round about his chair a number of suche mortall men that none can tham declair, Whereof than some wer prisoners by him in battall tane, some pearced by his pearcing darts, and som by him lay slane. I wandring than to know sum newis of him and of his trane, and so far fordwart marched on, all weryed all with pane, Did than perceawe my selff evin one of such a flok to be, when lowe from lyfe long tyme befoir had far dewyded me. Than stayed I a whyle to see if onye one I knew within the Thikkest of that troup that lowe so with him drew,— Who is a king that fasting is, and houngrie ay for teares, who makks men die, and daylie dois tham feid with lingring feares— Bot none thair wes I culd discerne; and yit if thair was one with whome I ones acquented was and now to death is gone, His face wes chaingd and countenance by preasoun or by death, whome crwell weird or fatall parks bereaued of his breath. Thus as I wes astonished and looking thair and heir, behould thair did rancounter me and to me did appeir A sight and shaddow sumwhat less then that I saw befoir, sad, pansiwe, dark, obscwir, and paill, vnknowen to me the moir, Which be my name me cald, and said, “let no thing this thee mowe, for all this Pompe and this Triumphe is purchessed by lowe.” Whair at I merveld verye muche, and said in speaches plane, “how kenst thow me, when swirlye I do know the not agane.” He answerd than: “this cums to pass, and this dois so appeare, evin through the burden of my bands and chanes that I do beare, And be this thick congested air, and be this foggie mist, which duskish is that so thy eyes with darknes dois resist; Bot I am he evin he thy freind to the was traist and trew, In thoskan bred, and thairin borne, whair first our freindship grew.” His speaches than and freindlie words and reason which of ould he wonnt to vse did quickly than this muche to me vnfould, Discouering at that instant tyme that which his face did hyde, as efterwart we satt ws doun eache one at others syde, Whair he began to speik to me: “long tyme is sen I thought To sie the heir with ws among, and in this band be brought, Becaus that we evin from thy aige and tender yeares did sie the verye sings within thy face that lowe shuld captiwe the.” Than ansuerd I: “that is most trew: at first I was so bent and trewlie I had yeild to lowe my hart and whole consent; Bot oh! alace! these troubles cryes that lovers do sustane afrayd me, and maid me from that course for to refrane; So that I left my interpryse to which I first did tend, bot in my breist the rev[i]uing raggs of lowe may yit be kend.” So said I than, bot as yit as he did heir in what a sor[t] I ansuer maid, he smyling than to me this did report, “O my deir chyld, what flams for the be kendled and prepaird!” bot oh! alas! at that tyme I did not his words regaird, Which now so deiplie be imprent within my head eache one, that none more fast nor solidlie be grawed in marble stone. Syne I, whoe be my neirest aige which so dois rage and burne alreddie learnd both toung and mynde the vse to speik and murne, Demanded of this shaddow dark, “I pray the tell of grace and courtesie what folk be these that marches in this place.” Than he replyed: “within short tyme thow by thy selff sall knaw, for of this cumpanye thow shalbe evin one of thame I shaw, And be this lord thow salbe led, so fettred fast and bound, this thow sall prowe, and yit not knaw how thow man cwir thy wound; Thy fortoun Is, thy fates ar so, thy destineis and thy lott, that this sal chanse or thow dissolue or yit vnloose that knott; Thow first thy plesant face sall change, thy hairis sall first be gray, er from thy neck and rebell feit these bands be tane away. Bot yit that I may satisfie the in thy young desyrs, what thow now crawist I will the tell, and shaw what thow requyrs. And first of him I will declair that gretest is of state, who dois at ones the lyfe of man and libertie abait, The sam Is he who by this world is named bitter lowe,— bot better sall thow know the sam and better sall it prowe, When that his force sall the subdew and so sall captiwe the, that ouer the he salbe lord, and thow his vassall be— In youthe a meik and modest chyld, bot in his yeiris and aige A cancard throward Tyran strong of fearsnes full and rage. Woe! woe to him that kenst so weill! and thow the same sall knaw before a thousand yeares be past: awake! for I it shaw. He also gendred is and bred of Idilnes and slouth, with wantonnes of mankynds mynd; his nurishing and his grouth Is of suche thoughts within tham selfs dois seme both douce and sweit, And deyfeid and made a god of pepill in discreit; To whome he is thair only death, and whome with hardest lawes dois vnder thousand chaines and nailles keip fast within his clawes, Thay leiding on and drawing furth thair dayis and lingring lyfe, sharpe, hard, seveir, and bitter als, all full of sturt and stryfe: This is the principall of this pompe and heigh triumphant lord, whose Triumphe is be many man so gloriouslie Decord. But whom thow seest so lordlyke goe and staitlie first dois come It is the Monark Cæsar greit, the empriour first of Rome, Whome that ægiptian Cleopatra in ægipt land did binde among the flouers with bewtye brawe and bountye of the minde; Now she ouer him triumpheth so with reasoun, lowe, and right, that he who did the world ourcum so with his manlye might Suld be subdewed by hir agane, and he suche change might see, And that the victors honour might the vanqueists glorye bee. The nixt to him It is his sone, Augustus greit by name, whose fervent lowe more loyall was and iustar more his flame, Who though he might his Liuia by force hir gett and gane, yet would he with maist humble suit vnto hir love attane, And by hir husbands owen consent obtened hir at his hand, suppose she was with chyld that tyme, to Ioyne in mariage band.” The thrid that marched with these twoe wes Nero the vniust, dispytfull, bloodie, cruell, fearse, and faythles, voyde of trust, Who passed on with visage full of yre and proud disdane, and yit for all [his] force and strenth Sabina hes him tane; And Mark Aurelius lykwyse thair went with this valiant king, full of all praise and honour als in glorye moist conding, Whose golden toung and sacred breist full of philosophie was for the luif of faustine maid a sing and mark to be. “These other two that standeth by so fearfull be mistrust Is Alexander Ph?reus and Dynneiss the vniust, Tane bothe in lowe, and in thair lowe afrayed night and day, Whose Ielous mynds through Ielousie did purches thair decay, And this effect thairof did ryse. Now he who nixt comes on Is that Æneas that lamentis vpone Ancandrum stone Dame Creusas death, king Priams chyld, who reft from him his wyiff, quha from Euander tooke his sone, and reft him of his lyiff: Hes ever thow hard one reasoun of or yit of him to talk that to his stepdames furious lust and bed wald no wayes walk, Quhome Pnædra so with prayers prayd, with lovelie lookes and sight, yit he thairto did talk no heade but shund that Dame by flight? Bot woe! alace! his chaist intent, his goodlie thoughts and mynde, did bring his deathe and als hir hate bothe terrible and vnkynde; And yit thairthrough shee wrought hir death, be love she thairto ran, a vengeance iust for Hippolite whome she exyled than, For Theseus consent thairto and also Ariadne, From whome hir sister reft hir spous and had from hir withhadden; But yit not iustlye may shee plaine, nor think hir much misvsd, she wrought her brothers dreidfull death, and father had abusd. Some pepill be who others blames when they thame selfs suld blame, and spyeth faultes in other men and seing not thair schame, Yet he who maketh sports and play and dois in fraude delyte, he suld not muche be greued be if he get quyte for quyte.” Thair saw I then his father nixt with all his pompe and praise Led prisoner in that Triumphe, on whome my eis did gaise To sie him thair tuix sisteris two brought thair in that convoye, And Ariadne of his death and he of Ph?dras Ioy. “He that is nixt is Hercules, that martiall man so bould, by Dianire and Iole and Omphale maid thrauld; The other who dois fauour him is that Achilles stout, quho in his lwiff had all his lwkt evin full of doole and dout. Heir standeth lykwyse Demophon, with him dois Phillis mwiff, quho for his stay and long abode did hang hir selff for lwiff. This Iason is, with him his Dame, Medea, ætas chyld, that followed him and lowe also through tounes and deserts wyild; And looke how muche she guyltie wes aganis hir father deir, or cruell in hir brothers death so voyde of shame and feir, So wes she more crueller and mowed in furious Ire, in grit despyte aganis Iasons love to sett his houss in fyre; And not content with this reweng she forder of did go To cutt in blads befoir his eyes the children of tham two; Sche thought this rigour no thing greit, nor yit to hurt hir hart, Nor yit beleued that by hir fact Reuenge did pass desert.” Than after cam Hysiphyle, who semed to complane that be the barbar lowe of one she was brought in disdane. Than saw I hir who by hir face of bewtye beare the name, fair Helene, Menelaus wyiff, the farest grecian Dame, Who had with hir that Shiphirdd thair that to his great disgrace did fixt his eyes and gaised vpon hir fair and hevinlie face, Wheare through greit tempests of grit wars, grit murders wyld &amp; strange, did ryse thairbye, and all the world did wp and dounsyid change. I after hard Œnome amangs these Troups full sad weip for the death of Paris toe, and for his luiff die mad, Thair lykwise Menelaus was who did for Helene mone To sie hir thoughts not fixt on him bot on him that was gone; And after was Hermione who for Orestes cryed To succour hir from Pyrrhus hands who had hir bewtye spyed. Thair also I did thair behould Accastus daughter fair, Laodomie, muche makking for hir Protesilaus cair. With hir I saw trew Argia, most fayithfull to hir spous, that maid his funerallis for his corss even with his teares &amp; vowes, More iust, more trew, and fayithfull more, more loveing in effect, than Eriphyle that for a chaine Amphiarus did detect. O Petrark! heare the sad complants, the sighs, and grevous sounds, That from these lovers miserable so miserablie rebounds, Who ar about to rander wp to him thair spreits and lyfe, that in suche sort thame governeth and gwydeth in such stryfe. I can not all thair names reherse that wer about that chair: not onlye men wes tham amongs, bot evin the gods wer thair; Thair press and number wes so great quhom Cupid led in chanes, that all the shaddowing Mirtell woods wer filled with thair tranes. For thair I saw the Cyprian dame, dame Venus bright and fair, with Mightie Mars, both neck, feitt, armes, bound be Vulcans snair, And Pluto that Proserpina did revish to the hell, who half the yeare did with hir dam, the other with him did dwell; Thair Iuno Ielous did I see, and brawe Apollo bright, that did despyse Cupidois aige, his youth, his bow, and might, Yit for all that this youngling boy his puissance maid him prowe, when in Thessalia he him shakt, and made him for to lowe. What sall I say than to be breiff and in this passage short?— behoulde these goddis and goddessis that Varro dois report, All Prisoners and captiwed now, and charged with thousand chaines; and with the same evin Ioue him self his charged leggs furth straines, And goes infettered hard afore this high Triumphant chair, subdewed be loue, and led by lowe, to mak his pompe more fair. Finis i cap. The Seconde Chapter of the First Triumphe of Lowe. Alreddye these my weryed eyes all weryed so to vew that brave Triumphe and princelie pomp that bravely did ensew, And yit thairwith not satisfied, desyrous more to sie, now heir and thair, to this and that, I did convert myne ee; Which things for to repeate and shaw as I did sie thame frame so short a houer will not permit nor thole I shaw the same. Than did my hart from thoughts to thoughts by intercourse so pass, when as I spyed two folkis a part togeather them amass, And hand in hand, so ioyntlie ioyned, promening softlye went, and reasoning in swetest words, they thus thair progres spent; Thair vncouth habit light and strange did mak me much to muse, and speache vnknowen to me, obscwre, which none bot they did vse; Yit all thair talk and conference which was betuix these twane, my marrow and interpretar and truiche man maid it plane; And after that I knew thame bothe I nerer did approche, And bouldlye did my selff inqyre, and on thame bothe encrochte, Quair I perceaved the one to be a freind vnto our name, The other ane adversar seveir and ennemie to the same. Vnto the first I me adrest And thus began to say: “O Massinissa, princelie prince, forgiwe me, I the pray, Evin for thy Scipions sake, and hirs be whome I now begin, that thow would pardoun what I speik and not be grewed heirin.” Thairefter than he me beheld and speiking thus began: “I willinglie than first would know quhat art thow for a man, Sen thow [so] well in me hed spyed and dois so weill discerne my double lowe vnto these twoe so stable and eterne.” I humblie answered him agane: “O peirles prince of praise, my pwir estate will not permit that thow me know these dayes; Bass is my port, obscure I am, my meanes ar meane and might, and from small flams that far ar plaist [thair] can not com grit light; But thy renowme and royall fame through all the world arrywes, whose force is suche that it coniones the hartis, the spreittis, and lywes Of those that never hes the sene nor sal heirafter see with knottis and bandes of lasting lowe that sall ay lasting be. Now tell me if this gratious Duke in whose Triumphe yow go, if that in peace and quietnes he dois conduct yow two, Whiche couple makis me think such things to be so strange and rare, and of the fayithfull rarest fayith that anye can declair.” Than answered he: “thy toung dois prowe In naming me so prest that thow dois knaw evin by thy self my state and all the rest; Yit for to chaise far from my hart the doole which dois it grewe, and so results evin by hir death who now no more dois lewe, To thy requeist I yeild consent. I having than my hart Vpone that high victorious Duke, whose lowe hes wrought my smart, So stedfastlye implaist on him which no thing might supplant, That Lelius in this respect with no small pane could vant, Whairevir might his standart than or ensei?e be found, thair wes I lykwyse prest in armes to combat on the ground; To him was fortoun fauorable, from him she did not swerve, yit not so far as did his actis and doughtie deids deserve; Suche valeur was implaist in him, suche manhoode in his mynde, his lyke was never sene befoir, nor yit sall com behynde. Now after that the Romane armes with honour wer besprent, and sparpled to the vtmaist parts of east and occident, With him I me adioyned then, and lowe with hir me ioyned in such a sort that deathe hir self yit not hes vs disioyned. Was never suche a sweitlie flame two lowers breists did burne, nor never sall, as I belewe, for which I mone and murne, And wepeth that suche few short nights which makis me cair and crye suld all my pleasouris ouercross and my deserts all drye. For being in vane conducted both vnto our mariage bed, and all our iust and lawfull links to brokken be and shed, And thairwith all my trew despysed, and no excuse prewaill In this my fwrie and my lowe that did me so assaill, Be him whose valour in it selff than all the world was more, be him whose words wer holy all and full of fame and glore, Be him who had no pittye on of both our sighs and wo, be him, and by his holye speache, we parted wer in two. From thence, alas, did ryse our doole: and yit, I must confes, in doing so he hes done weill, suppose my Ioyes ar less; I saw suche perfyte proofes of grace in him suche vertew flame within the mynde of Scipio that ay sall liwe in fame: And as the man is stony blinde that can not see the Sun, even so Is [he] that not remarques the splendure he hes wun: Greit iustice is to Louers trew a sore and greit offence: so that his counsell grawe and wyse that stayed our gude pretence Was evin a rok and craggye stone to brek that interpryse, which we by force of fervent lowe amangs ws did dewyse; By aige to me he brother was, by lowe my sone, I say, By honour evin my father deir, quhome I must neids obey, Suppose I was with heavie hart with sadnes full and wo, and with a lowring countenance constraned to do so; From whose command and counsell cam My Sophonisbas death, quho seing hir selff so prosecute by romans spytefull wreath, And almost brought within thair bands, she chused first to die than to be brought in servitude, and throught thame shamed be. And I my selff evin of hir death the minister even was; she prayed me to do that whiche her prayers brought to pass; So doing that whiche she desyred, and bringing it to end, hawe wrought offence against my selff that would not hir offend; So that I than hir sent a coupe, within a poysened drink, with such a wofull sort of thoughts and sorrow yow may think, As I do know, and she beliues, and thow thy selff may Trow, if that suche coales of kendled flames hes kendled bene in yow. And now the heareshipp which I hawe and partage be my wyfe ar Onelie plaints, greif, [doole], and woe, and Long and Lasting stryfe; In hir did rest my onelie hoipe, in hir wes all my bliss, these hawe I lost for to conserwe my fayith but stane or miss. But searche gif that thow now may see in all this trowpe and dance A thing so wonderfull and strange and of so rare a chanse; Considder this in tyme becaus the tyme is light and swift, And thair is mater more than day that bydis a longer drift.” As I was pansing full of reuthe and pittie for thame two, and of the short tyme of thair lowe so wrapped full off wo, Togeather with thair fervent fyre which feirslie had begun, me thought my hart wes maid of Snow, and set against the sun; And thuswayes musing in my mynd, I hard hir as she went say to hir lowe, “this man me grewis, and makis me malcontent; I firmelie keip within my mynd, and earnistlie in thought, To hate him for his nationis saik who our distructioun wrought.” Than this to hir I spak agane, “do this for my requeist: O Sophonsiba, be at peace, and put your mynde to rest; Your Carthage hes be these our handis bene wrackt and ruined thryse, and at the thrid tyme all vpraisd and on the ground now lyiss.” Bot quicklye she this spak agane, “shaw me this other thing: quhen Afrik weipt, did Italye than ather laugh or sing? For proofe heirof cast ower your bookes, and these your stories wryte, And they will shaw gif yow enquyre, for thay of bothe Indyte.” And thus our freind, hir lowe also, did smyling than depairt, and to the thikkest of the Troup thair stepps they did convert, So that these eyes, these lights of myne, that on thame gaised afore, through multitude evin of the press culd not behoulde thame more. Than as a man by doutfull wayes dois at adventure ryde, now standis now restis at euerye place, and can not tell quhat syde Or yit quhat way to turne him to, bot looketh heir and thair, so that his doubtfull wandring thoughts his passage dois empair, Evin so the number of these men who captiwed went with lowe did mak my going doubtfull slow whair evir I did mowe. And yit I had a more desyre and semed more content To know how muche, and through what fyre, these lovers all wer brent: Quhair on my left hand I had espyed, without the commoun way, evin one who dois resemble him who earnistlye dois pray, And cowittis things with greit desyre, and in his suit hes sped, bothe blythe and blushinglie departs his former stepps to tred; Evin in suche sort I saw that king who gawe his loving wyiff and chosen spous vnto his sone to lenght his lingring lyiff. O lowe! o lowe in high degre! O courtesie most strange! O wounder greit more far agane to see hir in that change And that excambion so content that she but blusht for ioy! This marching on they to thair troupe did then thame selfis conwoy, Conferring on thair sweit desyris, bot sighing that she cost The Syrian scepter, and hir crowne and kingdome thairby lost. I drew me neir vnto these spreitts that wer about to stay, consulting how that thay might go and tak a nother way, And saying to the formest man that narest wes my syde, “I pray the now maist instantlye that thow wold me abyde;” And he evin at the first resound of that my latine toung, with troubled face depaint with Ire vnto a musing doung, Restraned his stepps to know who cald, and quiklie did dewyne what wes my will and my desyre, and so me answered syne: “I am Seleucus heir, with me Antiochus gois, my sone, who had grit warrs against yow all, and bothe by them vndone; Bot right nor reason contrar force hes nather rowme nor place; and this is she first wes my wyiff whome now my sone dois brace, Whome I did quyte and did resing to be his lauchefull wyiff To free from death and chase away the danger of his lyiff, To whiche his lowelie hid desyris and closet secreit flame conducted him, and so that gift wes lawchfull than but blame. Stratonica she named is, and so our chanse and lott is, as thow seist, indiuisible, and, by this sing, the knott Of this our long and lasting lowe is yit so tewche and strong that no thing that can seperat which first was ws among; Schee was content to quyte to me the kingdome, I my wyiff, than my belowed deirlye spouss, and he agane his lyiff; So warlye went he in his lowe, so far by reason furth, that he more maid him so estemed of one and other wurth; And if it had not bene by skill, by help and ayd discreit of that expert physicien, with practise full compleit, Who well espyed where lay the caus that did his helth doun ding, his youth, evin in hir flowris, had endit and finisht in hir spring: For he in scilence and in lowe did ryn vnto his death, his feitt him failed, his voyce was waik, his powers, lyfe, &amp; breath; Fates caused him lowe, his vertew maid him hyde It to the end, and my paternall pietie the succour hes extend.” Thus as he spak, than as a man that dois mak change for change of hailsing others mutuallye dois boythe by other range, So at the end of these his words he turned his stepps and heill, that I with grit difficultie might bid him than fairweill. Than after that from these my eyes the shade away had gone, which wer with pittie heavie maid, I sighing progrest one, For that my hart from these words was not vnbound nor losed, bot reuthfullie remembered that which he to me disclosed. At last to me that tyme wes said, “thow standeth to to muche vpone one thought in dywers so and of varietie suche, Whiche shortnes of the slyding tyme, as thow to weill dois knaw, will not permit in large discourse that I thame to the shaw.” Not Xerxes to the seis of grece conwoyed suche a band of armed men by Nawall host as thair with thame did stand, Evin suche a trowpe of lowers all, both nacked, bound, and tane, as that my eyes vnable wer to suche a sight sustane; They wer in toungis so different, and of suche dywers landis, as scarslye I evin one can name of thousands led in bandis, So that the storye whiche I wryte, and Poeme I compyle, sall be of these, and thame a few, whome I thair knew that whyle. And Perseus first sall prease in place, whose lowe maid me desyre to knaw how that Andromeda did sett his hart on fyre, And how in Æthiopia land that virgine, blak of hew, did with hir eyes and crisped hair him to his lowe subdew. Nixt him wes thair that lower vane quhose bewtye was his wrack, Who through to muche desyre wes quyte destroyed and all sackt, And onelie pwir maid by his welth and by abundance skant, and now transformed in a flour that seid and fruitt dois want. Besydis him was that Echo nymphe who for Narcissus cryed, whose corse wes changed in a stone, and voyce in rocks was dryed. With hir wes Iphis in that rank, so bent vnto hir deathe, That hate hir selff for others lowe, and reft hir self of breathe; And manye other damned soules condamned to lyke pane, and in thair marche did all lyke cross and fortoun hard sustane, A Pepill who through to muche lowe did lothe in lyfe to liwe, through rigour of thair cairles dames whose pryde thame most did griwe: Quhair also I did thair perceawe of this our aige ane ost, whose names for to recount or tell wer work and labour lost. With thame wer those whome lowe hes maid Eternall marrowis two, Trew, iust, and fayithfull Ceice, and constant Alcio, Who at the borders of the seis, and at the shoers his syde, did big thair nests evin at the best and calme of wintar tyd. Along from thame wes Esacus who pansiwe thair did stand, and searching for Eperia, now sitting on the land, Than on the watrie floods agane, and now to mount more highe, and Sylla, Nisos cruell chyld, far from hir father flie. Thair than I Atalanta saw, be aples thrie of gould and with the bewtye of a face ourcummed and contrould; With hir, hir lower, Hippomenes, who far abowe the rest of all that Troupe of lowers wer and wretched rinners best, Who only by his valeur did hir vowes and othes supplant, And Ioyfull of the victorie so marching on did vant. Among the faboulus lovers vane which poetts dois reherse was Galatea, atis eik, and Polipheme so ferse, Who Atis slew whils as he did within hir bosome ly; and so with noyse and rumour greit these thrie than passed by. Thair Glaucus fleting on the wawes to enter in that band but Sylla whome he did desyre and with such ?eale demand, And blameing Circe named her a lower fell and ferss; with them wes then these other two which Ouid dois reherss, Canence with hir Picus chaist, sumtyme one of our kingis, bot now by Circe maid a fowle that chatters and not singis, Whose sorcerye did change him from his name and browdered robbs, for which hir weilbeloued lowe ay sighing waillis and sobbs. I saw lykwise Egenas teares, and Scylla haif for bones in place thairof a hard sharpe rock, that sounds, that rores and grones, And from hir name the crage so called, so that vnto that sie whair it is plaist dois ever grow greit shame and infamie. I Also Canace beheld who haveing in one hand a fatal, nacked sworde, as did hir father hir command, And in hir right a Pen to wryte in doole and deip dispair, and to hir lower than hir lowe hir dolent deathe declair. With hir wes thair Pigmalion, with him his dame did byid, and thousandis moe, who singing then wer at the fountanis syid Of Aganipp and Castalie; whear then I saw in end Cydippe with that aples scorned Accontius did hir send. Finis.2. cap. The thrid chapter of the first Triumphe of Loue. So Muche my hart wes then amaised, so much of mervell full, that I thair stoode, euen as a man that stupid stands and dull, And can not speik, bot holdis his toung, and lwikis if anye man be neir of yit him round about to giwe him counsell than, When that my shaddow and my freind began thus for to say: “quhat dois thow now, quhat looks thow on, quhairon thy thoughs dois stay? Knawis thow not weill that I am one evin of this troupe and band whome lowe dois leade, with whome I go, that can not him with stand?” Than answered I: “my brother deir, thow best my state dois knaw, and als the lowe that in my breist dois to suche kendling grow, Whose force is suche that evin what thingis of the I suld requyre togeather with suche lyke affairis ar stayid by greit desyre.” Than he thus spak agane and said: “alreddie I hawe knawen, thought thow through Silence speik no thing, what thow woldest hawe the shawen. Sen thow wold know what folk be these and pepill thow hes spyed, I will the tell if to my toung the vse be not denyed. Behold that greit and glorious man so honoured of all, he Pompei is, that leidis with him Cornelia with all, Who with hir salt and wattrye teares condooles his dolent death, which Ptolome that vyld did caus through terrour more then wreath. He whome thow seis more farrer off is that greit valiant greik, conductour of the valiant ost, And heir Egistus eik, That murderer, adulterer, that poltroun, paliard preist. This cruell Clytemnestra is, that cruell godles beist Be whome it may now weill be knowen, and be thame we may fynde if lowe inconstant be and vane, Incensat, furious, blynde. Bot yit behold yon other Dame of gretar fayith and lowe, that fayithfull Hypermestia fair, and so did Linus prowe. See Pyramus and Thisbe both to stand the shadow by, with Hero at the window, and in seis Leander ly. This shaddow that thow pansiwe seis is that Vlisses whome his chaistfull wyiff dois long exspect and prayeth to come home, Bot Circes that enchantiress through lowe dois him detane, and dois empesh his fordwart stepps, and maks him stay agane. This other whome thow dois behold it is Amilcars sone, bold Hanniball, who stoutlye did with the Romans conione, Whome Rome thought not in manye yeares nor Italie might abaise, yit hes ane abiect woman him of Pulia led in lace. Sche that with hair both cutt and short dois follow so hir lord was quene of Pontus, that for lowe dois now to this accord With servile clothis and suche attyre Mithridates to serwe, that in his Iornayis and conflicts from him did never swerwe. This other Dame Is Portia bould, Brutus fayithfull wyiff, that sharps hir sword hard by the coalis and ends by tham hir lyiff; Thair also Iulia thow may sie, that weped for hir spous, for that vnto his second flamms he more Inclynes and bowes. Now turne thyne ene and thame conwert vnto that other syde, whair our greit father, Iacob scorned, dois with these folke abyde, And yit for all that dois not forthink or mened from hir to swerwe for whome with constant loyall lowe he twyse sevin yeres did serwe. O lywelie lowe! O force most strange that dois not only lest, bot growis be griefis, and alwayis Is by troubles more encrest! Behold the father of this man, with him his guidshir toe, departing from his duelling place, and Sara lyk to doe. Than after lwik how cruell lowe and weked Dauid wan, enforceing him to do that work from whence he after than Within a dark and secreit cawe, withdrawing him a part, weipt for his faults and for his sinnis in anguish of his hart. Behold also how suche a mist and suche lyke darkned clwde dois so obscure his sone his face and darknes owershrude, And cower the praise of all his witt, and mak the sam be smored, which publisht wes through all the world by our supernall lord. Than Amnon spye whoe at one tyme did Thamar lowe and hate, and how she Then to Absalon hir brother did repeate, Disdanefull and maist dolorous, the caus of all hir woe, his raging lust and hate agane his kyndnes to ourthroe. Before a litill thow may see one stronger more then wyse, I Sampson meane, who with his wyiff did foolishly dewyse, And through hir clattering trifling tryes than she did than delair, did putt his heid within hir lappe, that cutt away his hair. Beholde also how that amangis so manye speares and swordis, loue, sleip, and als a wedow fair, with manie plesant wordis, And with hir cumlye clenelye cheikis, accumpaned with hir maid, hes killed holipherne the proude, and vengeance him repayid, And thay returnyng to thair toun, and in thair handis his heid, at midnyght gevin god the thankis, to which thay haist with speid. See Sichem, and with him his bloode, how that the same is mixt with circumcisioun and with death, and with the slaughter nixt OF bothe his father and all these that pisht aganis the wall. o force of lowe both strong and greit that maid suche suddane fall! beholde Assuerus in what sort he begging seikis his lowe, that he in peace may heir possess, and how he dois remowe And so vnloose his former knottis, and frie him of these bandis that bound him fast, I meane his wyiff that keipt not his commandis, And how that be ane other knott agane he hes him bound, whiche onlye is the salve that may in contrare lowe be found; And all suche malice to efface thair is no better thing, Euen as a wadge and other doith and nail and naill furth bring. Now wold thow sie within one hart the bitter with the sweitt, and lothesomnes with lowe agane evin in one mynd to fleit, Behold Herodes, cruell, fearse, of kyndnes full and rage, whome lowe with crueltie and hate so long tyme dois assuage; Regaird how that the first dois burne and lye in fervent flame, and after how he gnawes [his] hart in memorie of the same, And calling for his Marion, which than dois not him heir, To late he now repented him of suche his rage seveir. Beholde agane these other thrie both good of lyfe and lowe, Deidamia with Arthemise and Procris so did prowe; Now sie lykwyse these thrie so curst and toucht with raging flame, Semiramis, with Biblis eik, and Myrrha, voyde of Schame, how ewerye one of thame appeiris for shame to blush and stay, that thay can hawe no licence for to walk with tham that way, But for to tak the throwen streit, and evin of that denyde. beholde that Troupe that fillis with dreames the papers on all syd, Quhose workis dois mak the vulgar sort to reid thame and requyre, and vanelye through thair erring dreames so for thame haif desyre, These ar the wandring loveing knights of Arthurs table round, wheare Geneure with hir Lancelot with others may be found, As Tristan with Isota fair, the king of Cornuallis wyiff, And als that counte of Aremine who lost for lowe thair lyiff.” Lord Paul of Matatestas houss, and Franschescina fair in makking mone and sad lamentis and wailing marched thair. Thus as my freind and shaddow spak I at that tyme did stand Evin as a man that is afrayid for ill that is at hand, And trembleth fast before he heir the Trumpet shaw his dome, and feilis his dolent deathe befoir the same by sentence come: So was my state evin at that tyme; my face such cullour keipt as one drawin furth evin of his grawe wherin he long did sleip; Quhen than with palish face and wan befoir me I espyde a lywelye Nymphe, more fairer than a dow, stand by my syde, Who thair me twik and captiwe led; and I who wold have sworne To haif defended well my selff, and men of armes ourborne, Was with the smyrcling of her eyes and smyling of hir face and with hir plesant gracious words than snared in hir lace. As I was thinking on this thing, and for the treuthe to shaw, My freind more nerer did approche and towardis me did draw, And lawghin rounded in my eare (whose laughter caused my wo That at my losses he suld smyle) and thus began he so: “Now hes thow licence for to speik evin quhat thow [ ] and pleis, To shaw how lowe evin in his moode dois both the pane and eiss, Sen now we both saill in one bark, and both one liquour lik, and bothe Together marked lyke and touched with one pik.” I Than becam as one of those who more is discontent of others happ and better lwck and prosperous event Than of my loss and haples chance, and so more grewed wes I when as I did the Dame me led in peace and fredome spy; And after as to late my loss and dommage I did knaw, so from the bewtye of my dame I maid my death to grow. For brunt with lowe and with his flame, and with Inwy enrage And Ielousie was than my hart which no thing culd asswage; Nor wold I turne my staring eyes away from hir fair face, bot as a man by feawers weakt so semed I in that cace, Who, thought he seik and feaverous be, yit hes a gredie will For that whiche to his taist is sueit bot to his helth is Ill; So that to anye other Ioy whiche more might glaid my mynde my eares war deaffe and stopped bothe, my eyes wer shutt and blynde In following hir whose steppis me led by manie doubtfull pace, so that in thinking on the same I tremble yit, allace. For ay since syne my eyes through teares wer on the ground fixt wak, my hart was sad and pansiwe ay; the Ins that I did tak And solitarye resting place was then the wellis and woods, The fountanis, rivers, mountanis, hillis, the craggie rokkis, and floods; Sensyne the Papers and the scrollis which I haif sperst alwayes with thoughts, with teares, with Ink, to pen my panis and paint hir praise, Sometymes through lowe, sometymes through wreath, I forced was and spyte To teare them all in peaces small, and ower agane to wryte. Sensyne I know how lowe retanis within his cloyster now Doubt, dreid, dispair, and deip distrust, and hope with constant wow: So that the man that weill wold knaw the feates and fruittis of lowe, the panis, the plagues, the lingring tymes, that lowers hourlie prowe, Gif he can reade, than lift his eyes vnto my forrett now, whan he sall sie all these effectis fair writtin on my brow. And hir I sie so cairles walk, that fair and gallant dame, not toucht with rewth for all my panis, bot cairless of the same, And rekles bothe of them and me, she taketh no account Now whither I sink or yit I fleit, I fall or yit I mount; Sic graces now dois grow in hir, such bewtye she dois shroude, that of hir vertew now she gois and of my spuil?ei proude. And on the other part I spy, and seis on other syde, Evin lowe him self to stand in feare, and from hir him to hyd; Althought he winneth all the world, he can not hir subdew, so that past hope of help am I, nor lowe can mak reskew; In my defence thair none that standis, no succour comes to me and in my ayde no boldnes can nor force can mak supplie. For lowe him self in whome I hoipe and confidence dois byde, whose custume is most cruellie to flyte if lowers hyde, And fleish with myne thair skin from thame, [dois] dalley with his dame, and flattringlye carressis hir, yit cairis she not the same; Nor anye be that more or less may force yit or constrane This Rammage and rebelling mayde with lowe for to remane, Bot going be hir self allone, and frie from lowe his lace, with drawis hir from his enseing?e a long and distant space. And trewlye in hir bewtye shee, and in hir port and pace, and in hir smyles and high disdanis, and in hir wordis and grace, Sche in this sort surpassis so, compared with other dames, evin as the sun the litill sparkis excedeth be his flames; So fair appeiris hir hair to be that they do seme of goulde, all shaking softlye by the winde which dois thair tress vnfoulde; Her eyes lyke hevinlie lamps and lighs that so inflams my hart, that through thair grace I am content that they incress my smart. Quho can with hir behaviour and angelyke adress, with maners meik and custumes high, compair or yit expres? For he who would in poeme prease condinglie to report hir vertewus deidis and glorious acts, I think he suld come short: It far my learning dois surpass, my wawering pen dois shake, my style, my verse, my voyce, my phraise ar owerbass and wake; No pen can more depaint hir praise or yit aduance hir glore than litill strandis the largest seis dois be thair course mak more. O thingis most new, and never sene befoir vnto this day, nor more bot ones, nor after sall thair glorye more bewray! It is a thing sall never be, hir lyke sall never cume, and on hir vertew and hir grace all voyces salbe dume. So do I finde my self now bound, and she in fredome frie, and I exclaming in this sort, “O starr, how gydis thow me? O cursed starr! o fates vniust! what thingis do ye portend? how chanseth It that for my panis I rype no fruit in end?” I day and night bewaillis my woe, and ay dois call and pray To hir quho cairis not for my moane, nor yit to heir will stay, So that with grit difficultie, with trawell, toyle, and pane, I skarslye for ten thousand wordis can one obtane agane. O law seveir of Cupidis court! yit thought it crooked be and inderect, yit must we all to follow it aggrie, Becaus It is so ancient, so vniuersall ould, that it conioynes to the heavin earth so law &amp; could, Whose potent power and strong effect not onlye men hes proven, bot evin the Manhoode of the gods by it hes bene ourthrowen. And now sen lowe hes me subdewed I knaw and haif espyed how that he dois the hart of man far from his corss dewyid, And how he can gif pane and peace, long lasting weiris with trewis, and doolefull tydingis to dispair, and than more better newis, And how he forces outwardly men for to hyde thair woe, when Inwardly thair breistis brunt, suppose it seme not so; And how evin in one instant tyme the blwid in haist departis, and quiklye from his vanes dois rin and in his cheikis convertis, If so it chance that anye feare dois than his mynde posses, or shamefastnes constrane him blush or terrour him oppres. I knaw how that the serpent lyis all hid within the floure, The snaris, the girnis, the Nettis, and baitts, the loweris dois devoure; And also how he Ielous walkis and sleipis in dreid and doubt, suspecting ay his riwall foe by lowe shuld thrust him owt. I also know how this my lyfe dois languish by dispair, and how I dieing never die, nor death can end my cair; I also know how for to trace the fitsteppis of my foe, and how for feare to find hir syne I stand in dreid than goe; I also know in quhat a sort and quhat a guyse so strange the lingring lower in his lowe dois him transforme and change, And how among so longsome sighs and shortned smylingis I can change my state, my will, and hew, and cullour sone thairbye; And how to liwe and stand but lyfe, when as my wofull hart Is soundred from his spreit and soule, her lyiflie vitall part. I also know how lowe hes led me in this danse this whyle a thousand wayes and vane deceittis my selff for to beguyle; I also know how for to burne in following so my fyre wheare it dois flie, and how at hand so fresis my desyre, And farder of dois rage agane, and burne in gretar flame, and nearer than how I congeall and fresis in the same. I also know how lowe dois bray and rout abowe the mynd, and how it dois all reasoun smore and chaise vnto the mynd; I also know the dywers artis that lowe through craft dois vse For to subwert the lowers hart, and how him to abuse; I know how that a gentle mynd Is suddanlie disgraist, and how that be a litill Cord it stronglie Is vnlaist When it is left vnto hir selff, disarmed of reason than, and when none Is to mak defence aganis the lustis of man. I also know how luiff dois shutt, and than dois flie away, how that he boastis and stryketh both, and puttis all in a fray; I also know how that he rubbis and playis the theif perforce, how that he revis and spuil?eis all his pillage but remorce; And how instable is his wheill, how doubtfull is his hoipe, how certan is his wrack and woe, and how his course and scope Is for to mak such promesis that ar of fayith dewoide, by which the trew and fayithfull hart is scorned and destroide. I also know how in his bonis the raging flam dois lurk, how in his vanis the hiddin hurt dois his consumptioun wurk, From whence dois cum his oppin death and fyre through smoakis exprest, that secreitlie in secreit did harbour in his breist. In end, for one conclusioun, I know the lowers lyfe to be inconstant, wandring, vane, and full of sturt and stryfe, both feirfull and bothe hardye to, and how dois lowe repay the litill sweit with bitterness so long to lest for ay; I know thair custumes, maners, vse, thair sighis, thair gronis &amp; song, thair brokken words, thair suddane peace, thair silence, dombe and long, Thair shortest smylis, thair long complaints, thair teares, þair grevous fall, thair pleasouris with displeasour crost, thair honye mixt with gall. Finis 3. cap. The 4. Chap. of the Fi[r]st Triumphe of Lowe. Quhen after that my fortoun had and lowe me forwards thrust within ane others force and strenght, and so had brought to dust And cutt in two the vains, and nervis, and fredome of my will and libertie, which long tyme I frie remaned still, Than I who was afore als frie and wyld as hony hart was quiklyie tamed and sone subdewed with litill pane and art, And brought to knaw the lukles lott and vnexspected chanse with these my marrowis miserable whome lowe led in his danse. Than did I spye thair Trawell, panis, thair cummer, and lament, The throwin wayes, the crwiked lanis, the paith, and stratis they went, And be what art and laubour they conducted thairto wer, quhair all that lowelie flok and troupe did then so wandring err. And quhillis I rold in ewerye syd my gasing restles ene, gif I culd spy thair any man whose fame so cleir hes bene Be historeis of ancient tymes, or Poems in our dayes, in whiche more late and recentlie included is his praise, I saw evin then fair Orpheus, of him I first will tell, who onelie lowed Euridices, and following hir to hell Obtened hir with him agane, yit lost hir thane agane, And being deid yit callis on her with toung most could in vane I Alceus saw, so pregnant, promp, of lowe that culd indyte, And Pindar with Anacreon that of the same did wryte, Who had thair muse, thair rymes, and verse all penned in behowe Of Cupids court, whose Poems lay within the Port of lowe. I Virgill saw, and him about his brawe companions stwide, brawe Poettis of ane high ingyne and of a mirrie mwide, Whose works this world so estemes that they them first elect, extolling thame in highest praise and honorable respect, Ouidius with Corinna caught, and Tibull, Plania, Propertius who so whotlie song in praise of Cynthia; Catullus also thair I spyed, whome Lesbia led in lowe, with hir that lerned Sapho greik, that passionis lyke did prowe, Resounding with hir noble voyce, with Poettis who wer thair, hir swetest songs, and shew hir style to gallant be and raire. So lwiking heir and thair agane, to this and to that syid, vpone ane flowrye plesant grene I quiklye than espyid A Pepill speiking on to walk, and reasoning as they went: and so I saw than first appeir evin Dant incontinent With Beatrice, Seluaggia nixt, and Cin of pistol bred; and Guido of Aresso was with thame in that trowpe led, That semed for to be displeased, and angrie, malcontent, that he was not thair first with lowe and formest with him went; With them two other Guidos wer and those of Scicilie, and that gude natured Bolonguese, a honest man was he; Sennicio with Franceschin thair lykwyse did tham shaw, the gentlest men and courtesest that evir men did knaw. And after such a sort of folk In vulgar clothis I spyed, and habittis of suche strange attyre that marched on that syd: Amongst them first they wer in preiss Arnaldo Daniell, a maister gritt in Cupids court that did in lowe excell, Who yit dois by his plesant speiche and his Inventionis new renown his natiwe countrey soyle by these thair sight and vew. Thair also was whome lightlye lowe with litill pane ourcame— on Peter, and Arnaldo wes the other of less fame. Thair also was these sort of men subdewed by gretar war, two of one name, Rombaldi cald, that song in mountferrar Vpoun thair Dames, fair Beatrice; with him Giraldus, loe, and aged Peter of Averne; with him was Felchetto That gaue the name to Marseils toun, and did from Genis awfer, and changed his countrye, clothes, and state, and better had for war. Giaufre Ruda also was who more through lowe than wreath did vse the speid of saillis and ores to speid his fereth death; And also thair that William was who with his lowers songs dois frie his name from all decay, that muche his praise prolongs; Amerigus, and Bernard to, and Hugo with Arselme, and thousand moe who vsed ther toungs for lanss, sword, bukler, helme. And now since it is semelie than my dollour I dewyd, I hawe conwert my daseled eyes all weryed to that syd, Wheare I haif spyed my fayithfull freind, good Thomas that dois grace Belongna toun with lasting fame, and makis his praise encress, And by his songs and sonetts so Messina makis to grow more fatt in praise, and ratcher more, and more in brawer show. O fleing sueit! o faiding ioy! o weryed panefull Lyfe! who is it that dois vnto me procure this sturt and stryfe? Who is it hath than tane from me my freind and onelie Ioy? who quiklye now befoir his tyme dois him to grawe conwoy, But whome and but whose cumpanie, such now is my mishapp, that I can nather space nor pase nor forther go a stapp? Well now I knaw which thing I might hawe better knowen afore, how that the lyfe of mortall men, whairin so muche we glore And lyketh in the same to liue, is but a stage of noyes, a seik mans dreame, or foolis conceat, and fable full of toyes. I was a litill sumwhat furth owt of the vulgar way, when Socrates and Lelius did first thame selfis bewray; With thame it me behowed than to walk and farder go, and searche for leirning in thair workis and for thair scyence know. O what abundance of my freinds with vertew so decord wes led at that Triumphant chair whose gifts non can record, Whose ornat talk and eloquence nor witt can none reherse in facill prose, in loftye style, in ryme, and staitlie verse! And with these two I walking went, and searched dywers wayes, to thame I opned wp my plaintis and hurt my hart assayes; From thame no nather tyme nor place sall evir me dewyde, bot as I wish to do I hoipe with tham so long to byde Vnto the last gaspe of my breath, and never to reteir vntill the Cynders of my corss be burned on the pire. For with these two I hawe obtened that glorious laurell bough which dois the Tempills of my heade environ and my brow, Whiche hes perchance befoir the tyme my forrett so bedeckt, in mynde of hir whome yit I lowe and dois so muche respect. Bot yit of hir whose praise I paint and fillis my hart with thought, I never culd get branche nor leaffe which I with service sought, Nor anye pleasour culd obteane, so stable wes the rwit and so vniust to which she leaned that I culd rype no fruitt; From whense althought sumtymes my greiff and grevous doole did ryse, as his who hes ressaued offence to stay his interpryse, Yit she on whome my eyes did gase so rewled and ranged my will, that now no more I do regrait that she refused me till A mater swir of stately style and of heroicall verse To which no dolts nor ignorantis can yit attane or perse, Nor yit suche Poets of suche stuff of base and vulgar ryme, may well conceawe how I did see Cupido tane that tyme. But first to tell I will proceid, and first I will recount, how lowe so leading ws in linkis did so ower ws surmount; Than after this I sall furth shaw what he of hir sustaned, and how my Dame did vanqueish lowe and all his artis disdaned. This work and subiect is not myne, nor only maid by me, bot long before by Orpheus pend and Homer semes to be. Than followed we the noyse and sound of Cupids purple penns, and of his fleing horss that ran through thousand dykis &amp; denns, And through a thousand hillis and daillis; at last in end we came vnto his mothers countrie whair soiorned then that dame, And in whiche way whair we through brayes, through brearis &amp; busses went, through montanis, medowis, hillis, and wooddis, our chaines did not relent, Nor yit wer we vnloused of thame, but hurlet, mein?eit, riwin, as none of ws knew whair he was, nor wist how he wes drewin. Beyond whair that Egeum sea dois sigh and murne so oft thair lyes ane Ile delectable, more plesant, plane, and soft Than anye vther Ile that is bothe wett and washt with see, or warmed with the Sunnye beames or yit enflammed be. In midst thairof thair is a hill of shaddow full and grene, with sawour sweit and fragrant sent, with water sweit &amp; clene, Whose vertew is and whose effect to tak owt of the mynde all sad and pansiwe blottis &amp; markis that hes with greif it pynde. This is the land wherwith so much fair Venus is content, which consecrat was to that Quene that tyme be mens consent Whillis as the treuth was lying hid and veritie vnshowen, and chryist his incarnatioun was not reweilled nor knowen. And yit albeit this day it be of vertew leane and bair, yit dois it holde and it retenis some custumes keiped thair, That seames to these whose reasoun lowe &amp; vertew dois exclude both pleasant, sweit, and verye douce, and bittar to the gude. Thair than Triumphed ower ws that souerane gentle lord, and caried at his golden chair thair coupled in a cord These whome he twik in circling so the world round about Evin from the Inds to Thule Ile, the westmest part without; Thair in that place he did expose his spoyle, his pray, and gane, and from his bosome pulled furth the Louers thoughtis most vane. He had thair Vanitie in his armes, thair Sudden fleing Ioy, thair constant woe, thair solide greiff, thair stable firme anoy, Thair roses gathered in that tyme when wintaris blast dois boast, Thair Ice evin on the hatest dayes, at Midsommer thair froist; He also had before him than Distrust and doubtfull hope, and bakward on his shulders than agane he caryed bound with rope Repentance with displeasour sore, and anguish with anoy, most lyke the same that wes in Rome &amp; in the waisted Troy. The valley quhair this Triumphe was with murmour did rebound off watters, brookes, of Birdis and fowles, that gaif a clamorous sound, Whose bankis wer all imbroudered with flouers of variant hew, some whyte, some grene, and some agane red, ?ellow, &amp; some blew; And thair besydis cleir riwers from so lywelie fountanis ran, whair than vpone the colde freshe herbis the Sunn to shyne began. Thair also was a shaddow thick of Treis both high and fair, owt of the which than did cum owt a sweit and breathing air; And after when the wintar tyd dois mak the seasoun coulde, yit thair the Sun so dois his flames most temperatlie vnfoulde, And so dois mak the place and ground and meits almost lew warme, and through a Idilnes all slow the simple hartis incharme. And as that place so wes the tyme and seasoun than I say, quhen as the Æquinoctiall lyne dois victor mak the Day, And when that Progne laughs and chantis and dois at morning spring, Returning to hir sister than on thair lowers to sing. O trustles stay! o stayles fayithe of all our chanse and lott! for to resist or to withstand that lord It vailed nott: within that place, that seasoun, tyme, and in that instant hower, whaire lowe required ws from our eyes at larger dew to power, He in that hour that place and tyme whome vulgar dois adore wald than Triumphe in chariot bright as victor full of glore. So thair I saw what service he and servill death dois prowe, and to what vengeance is he brought that is infect with lowe: And sen the tyme and place is showen, so will I now declair which things war than plaist round about his high Triumphant chair. First Errour, nixt deluding dreames, and deadlie Shapes and paill, And fals opinioun at the Port That dois ower myndis prewaill, Than slipper hope and Slyding trust wes in the ladder stapps, and Damned gane with ganing lost that castis men in mishapps. The nature of the Greis was suche that they that highest went The lawer and the deiper doun agane was thair dissent; Than Weryed rest was on the heigh, and thair repose in pane with oppin Shame and glore obscwre and duskish did remane Vnfayithfull Fayithe, Disloyall lowe, and othes bot trew in shaw, Solistfull furye, madfull cair, and reasoun, sweir and slaw. Tuix these a preiss it was to which we cam by oppin way, but narowlie with straitnes pane our owtgait did assay; The steps thairof and enteres was both dounward sliding quik, the passage owt and going furthe wes high and rair vnthik; Within wes all confusioun, and trouble mixt with noy, a fray of Certen Woe and doole and of incertan Ioy. These Illis did never broyle so fast nor bray in burning rage of Vulcan, ishia, lippari, whose flams non can asswage, Nor Strombolis with Ætna, mount Montgibell cald by name, as did that place and presoun strong combur in burning flame; So that I think he hates him self, and less him self dois lowe, that would be practise know that yok and by his perrell prowe. Within that Cage and dungeoun dark, that preasoun stark &amp; strong, we captiuat wer prisoneris, and thair enclosed long, Wheare that my hairis and wonnted flight wer turned be tymes ecclips, and vnto pailnes all the fresh and rudenes of my lipps; So that my soule, so toucht with cair for that hir fredome past, which greit desyre makis prompt and light, was conforted at last, When as it spyed (thought but in dreme) these thingis so hard &amp; strange coequall with my state and plagis, and so go in thair change. Bot vewing thair so manye spreittis which in that pitt did wun, my piteous hart did melt lyke snow so sett against the Sun; And lyke as one who in short tyme dois vew sum picturis long, wherin ar draught and variant lynes and storeis tham among, With one fwte fordwart goeth on, yit after with his Ee dois backwart lwkt with better sight the more to mark and see, Evin so did I thair cast my eyes and roll thame round about the more perfytlie for to vew that band agane and rowt. Finis Triumphi amoris. The Seconde Triumphe called the Triumphe of chastetie. When then I saw, evin at one tyme, and in the self same place, the courage dantound of the gods whome lowe did so deface, And lykwise with these god[s] evin those who mortall men wer cald, and to the world did liwe lyke Sants, subdewed all and thrald, By thair estait and guiltie fall I did example tak, and by thair losses and thair harmes this proffeit did I mak; So thairbe confort cam to me which eased me of my woe, when as I spyed me tred that trace when gods and men did go. For thair I saw and did beholde fair Phœbus full of glore with Cupids bow and with his dart lye strukned verye sore; With him also that lustie youthe, Leander, Heros lowe, The one a god, the other a man, and so his death did prowe. I lykwise saw within one snair with Iuno Dido led, who for the woe hir husband deid hir vitall blood furth shed, Not as the publict voyce dois bruit, or commoun fame dois tell, becaus Æneas went his way, and would not with her duell. Thus seing than, wherefore suld I regrett or yit lament, or yit bewaill my fredome lost, or yit seme malcontent, Yf now I be by lowe ourcum whils as I wes but armes, young, rekles, and not well adwysed, vnwar of all my harmes? Or wherfore suld I than complane if Loue and not my lowe, or might not mak my freindlie foe his puissant power prowe? Nor yit haif I iust caus of doole that thair I saw agane Lowe in habit naked, spoyld, so pwrelie thair remane, Berewed of his feddered wings, and spoyled of his flight, though sorrow maid me to complane for to behoulde that sight. And thus when Cupid sone espyed, Evin as wyld lyons two with roring rumour other beasts in rage rancounters so, Or as two thundring thunderbolts doun dingeth heir and thair all thingis they find whair ever they light in heavin, earth, and air, No otherwyse I Cupid spyed adres him to my dame with all the argumentis he might hir to his yok reclame; Bot shee vpone the other part against him did proceid with swifter courss, so that she past both wind and fyre through speid. No gretar sound more terrible did Ætna mountane mak evin at that tyme Enceladus the giant it dois shak, Nor Scylla with Charibdis seis so ragis in thair Ire, that day nor night thair sturdie stormes dois ather waist or tyre, Than wes evin at the first conflict for to be sene and hard; so full of doubt wes that assault it can not be declaird. Than euerie man retired him self vnto the highest place, the better for to mark and vew who in that cruell cace And interpryse so horrible victorious maist suld be, with hart and eyes of Plaster maid, such succes for to see. This conquerour who first did prease to giwe the first on sett did tak in his right hand his dart, in left his bow did gett; Than for to put my dame in fray and in a gretar feare, he had alreddye bended It, and drawin it to his eare; And this did he so haistelie that not the flying hart more spedelie to foord and wood his course dois so convert, Persewed by the Leopard, discha[r]ged of his chane, or yit that in the wydest woodis in fredome dois remane; Yea, they had both bene Late and slow thair in respect of lowe, who with his visage full of flams did fast him fordwartis mowe. Thair might be sene within my breist, which all wes set in fyre, a sore conflict and doubtfull feyght tuix pitie and desyre: Desyre me mowed for to desyre that lowe suld victor be, and that my dame, by him subdewed, I might my marrow see; Bot Pittie than did pleade remorse, and caused me say agane, “It pittie war and hard to sie My Laura so lye slane.” yet vertew that dois neuer from the Verteuous folke estrange, evin at that instant shaw hir self that she dois never change, Nor yit thame leawe who trustis in hir, thought sum thairbe hir blame, from whome she hes hir self withdrawen to ludge them nixt thair shame. Was never suche a scrimeur than so able, war, and quik, for to awaird or to eshew the blow, the stogg, and prik; Was neuer Mariner so prompt nor so reddie a hand To turne the shipp furth of the rokkis and from the sinking sand. Thair was my Ladie, Laura fair, who with a bould defence, with honestie and shamefastnes, did lett his high pretence: Sche suddenlye hir visage fair did from his strykes so hyde that she both sharpe and egerlie did lowis assaults abyde. I was that tyme with eyes attent and bent for to behoulde the succes and the end of this greit feyght and battell boulde, And hoping that the victorie suld fall on Cupids syid, whair it is wonnt, and not from Lowe hir self dois oft dewyd; And in this hope I so became than through to muche desyre evin as a man vnmeasurablie who dois sum thing requyre Hes first his suit first putt in writt or he to speik begin, And in his eyes and forrett hes his toung and talk within: “I would,” I say, “O thow, my lord, if thou me worthie think, that with this Dame, if thow ourcum, I chaned wer and link; Feare not I swerwe from thy impyre, or yit my self sall frie furthe of these knottis wharwith thow hes so bund and coupled me.” Whils thus I spak and this did say, I saw my dame agane with face depainted full of Ire, and full of proude disdane, Demeur within her countenance, sad, sober, and so grawe, that no man is to shaw the same or able to conceawe, Althought his wittis wer singular and almost all dewyne; how than can I the same display that is of base ingyne? For thair it might hawe weill besene Cupidois golden darts, that kendled wer in fyrie flams, and waisted so mens harts, Through outwart blast of beautie brawe, with honestie quyte quainshed, and through the coldnes of my dame his ardent pleasouris stanched So greit hir mynde and courage was with valeur of the same that nather was the Volsian quene, nor amazonian dame That did support the Troianis and the Greikis of lyfe bereft, and vsed ay for to combat and shute ay with the left, In anye point of worthines with Laura to be compared, whose valeur far surpast thame bothe that I afore declared; Nor Cæsar great, that worthye wight, who in Pharsalia feild defaited Pompei with his host, and maid him to him yeild, Wes neuer so scharpe nor ardentar, or bouldar on his foes, than was my dame in contrare him who dois all armour lose. With hir than armed wer at ones evin all the verteus fair— o what a hevinlie cumpanie and glorious troupe was thair! Thay progrest so in this thair Pompe and brawe triumphant band, all Pair and pair, and two with two, and marching hand in hand. Vpoun the vanguarde thair wes plaist high Honestie that dame, with shamefastnes who trimlie did conduct and guyde the same, Two noble verteus of great praise, and in thame selfs dewyne, which maid my ladie, Laura fair, abowe the rest to shyne; Witt than with Modestie ensewid, and wer thair nighbouris nixt, Delyte, and good behauiour, who in her wer fixt; Than Perseuerance marched on, and Glorye cam behind, Entreatie fair, with goode aduyse of ane forseing mynd; And round about that valiant dame they wer in midle guarde Rare courtesie and clenelines for which sche muche ay cairde, Than feare of schame, desyre of glore, and thoughts in youthfull age, and Concorde rare (within this world) all rancour to assuage. In arire guard Trew Chastetie and Beutye brawe did go, and in this sort my ladie fair went to hir feghting so Against that souerane lord of Lowe with full intent to win, with fauour of the heavinis, and all the blissed sowlis thairin: And as my eyes vnable war thair fulnes to behoulde, so is my toung the meanest part thairof for to vnfoulde. Thair saw I this cleir cumpanie from lowe and from his bandis a thousand thousand famous sonnes spoyle by thair spoyling handis, And shake and strype furth of the same with victors voyce and psalmes a thousand thousand branches brawe of cleir victorious Palmes. That sudden fall and ouerthrow was never than so strange To Anniball, that victor long who did the Romanis range, And sextene yeares in Italie did brangill thair estait, and in the end by Scipio was vanqueist and defait; Nor yit that Giant Goliath with feare was more abasht when that the Hebrew chyld his branes &amp; head with stones had dasht; Nor Cyrus more astonished when that wedow came and killed him and all his route with lasting glore and fame, As than that tyme appeared Loue, who stoode evin in that place resembling him who now is whole, but in a litill space Is suddenlie in seiknes brought, with wonder is amased to sie his weilfair and his helth so suddanlie vpraised; Or evin as one who, touchte for doole for thingis he not forsees, dois with his handis bothe wype and rubb sham furth owt of his eyes: Loue evin so did thair remane, yea, in a worser state, for all his forcis and his folkis wer brawelie thair defait. Thair might be sene than in his face both dollour, dreid, and feare, and at one traict both shame and yre and anger greit appeare. The stormye seis not ragis so when they so angrye grow, and by thair contrare wyndie tydis thair bordouris dois ourflow, Nor yit that Ile, Inarime, which lyes on Tipheus bake, which he with boyling, foming rage and panefull pane dois shake, Nor yit Mountgibell brayeth so when that Enceladus sighs, And brusteth furth his rageing sobbs from bouldned breast &amp; lighs, As lowe did than both chawfe and rage and sighinlie did plane, To sie him self and all his folkis disconfited remane. Thus passed this greit cumpanie, so glorious in thair trane that for to tell thair valiancie my toung I must restrane; I am vnable that charge to tak leist I thair praise impair; I thairfoir turne vnto my Dame and to the rest wer thair. Sche had that tyme vpone hir bak a glorious gowne of whyte, and in hir hand That Cristall targe that wrought medusa spyte, And in the same a Piller was erect of Iaspar stone, wherin a chane of Diamants wer placed one by one, And Topassis mixt in the midst which verteus dames did vse, bot now no more they keip that vse sen they them selfs abuse. Thair saw I hir before my ene so fast Cupido tye, and plaging him so cruellie whair he did vanqueist lye, That suirlie than it semed to me the vengence to to muche; bot yit I wes content thairwith, and thairat did not grucht. My wittis ar waik, my Muse to slow, and slender my ingyne, To pen the number of these Dames and virgins maist dewyne: Nor Clio with Calliope and all these of that sect be able what these ladeis wer to shaw or yit detect; Off manye yit few sall suffice, and of these will I tell, who on the Topp of Honestie and dignitie did duell. Amangs the number of these Dames that staitlie thair did stand was fair Lucretia first in place, and keped the right hand; To whome Penelope wes nixt, who by hir force and might bespoyled lowe of all his armes and of his winged flight, And reaving from that froward lord his quawer, bow, and darts, they crusht, they brust, they threw, and brake tham in a thousand parts. Than nixt approchte Virginia, with hir hir father ferse, armed with disdane and pietie, and with a blaid to perse And wound his chaistlie dochters breist, which bothe to hir and Rome brought change of state, and by hir death thair fredomes both did come. Than afterwart the Germane Dames marcht fordwart in that band, who for to sawe thair chastetie did in thame selfis putt hand; Iuditha chaist, that Hebrew dame and wedow wyse and stronge, wes with these other daintie dames triumphing thame amonge. Nixt hir that brawe couragious dame, that Hippo heght by name, To sawe hir bodye ondefylit, and frie hir selff from shame, Did with a valiant worthye mynde, hir hard mishapp to sawe, that to hir chaist and cumlie corss she maid the sea hir grawe. With hir and other blissed Santis I saw Trumphe in glore my Dame and Lowe who ouer the world had first Triumpht before. Amangs the same I thair perceawed the Vestall virgine chaist, fair Thucia, who falslie wes by Infamie disgraist, Who for to purge hir of the same this miracle did giwe, she brought from Tiber floode to church furth water in a siwe; And after hir Hersilia, that brawe Sabinian dame, whose worthines dois euerie booke and storye furth proclame; With hir was these hir countrye maids whome Romanis through defait had rewishit to be thair wyiffis for to prolong thair state. And thair amangis these strangeris alss I hir did thair espye that for hir fayithfull loveing spous did tak hir death thairbye— Lat them the vulgar people peace, It Dido is, I say, who for the doole of Sicheus death she put hir self away; Thought Virgill wryte and publict bruit by Æne? do hir shame, It was but cair of honestie that poust hir to the same; And in the end thair prest in place one who did hir enclose within a place at Arno syde, bot she hir tyme did lose; For what she would effectuat and purpose bring to pass, hir honest thoughts and chaistfull mynde by force impeached was. This valiant and victorious band went fordwart in that tyme when that the wintar waxed hote, and spring was in his pryme; And so they all past Ioyfullie togeather in that way wheare that the saltish watrie wawes dois brek on bayas bay; And so they walked on a pace, and towards the right hand they marched on till they did come vnto that solide land, from whense betuix these mountanis two of Barbare and Auerne they progrest on till they did come vnto Sibilla derne; And further of they passed on vntill Linterno fort, in whiche so solitare a place that great man did resort And chiften brawe who hes his name from Aphrica with prayse, for that he was the first who thair did by his sworde mak wayes, Who did not thair in anye sort diminishe or abate by his renoun and purchest glore the newnes of thair state, Bot with his eyes most plesantlye thame pleased with Mirrie cheir; and shee that wes maist chaist in lyfe most fairest did appeir. In others pompe It would him grewed so in thair bandis to walk, who onelye was (gif mens beleiff be not in vane and talk) The onelye man borne to Truimphe and thairto to aspyre, and onelye bred to countreis win and conqueiss ane Impyre. Whair after they and all arrywed vnto that souerane toun, and first vnto that holye church so famous by renoun Which Chaist Sulpicia had erect, and to that end did frame, to quensht within the mynde of man all mad and rageing flame; And after they thair progress maid vnto that church whose name Is chastetie, that honorable and maist renouned Dame, Who kendleth in a gentle hart chaist will and high desyre, Not of the vulgar sort, bot such as vnto praise aspyre: Quhair in that church that Glorious dame did all hir spoyle expose before that goddes godlie feitt, and þair lykwyse depose Victorious leawes and sacred Palmes which she before had tane and reft from lowe, that to hir glore the same might thair remane. Thair was with hir that Toskane youthe, Spurinna heght by name, that Maigled had his visage fair for to eshew defame, Whose Bewtye was of such great force all wemen to subdew, that they wer win all to his lowe at his first blinke and vew; Thair did that youth with Laura fair displey and did vnhyde his bloodie wondis and magled cheikis with Chastetie to byde. With hir compered manye moe whose names my Guyde did knaw, and at the tyme of Thair Triumphe he did thame to me shaw, Who did dispyse Cupidois force and power in that band, And whome amongs fair Hippolite and Ioseph iust did stand. Finis Triumphi Castitatis. The thrid Triumphe of Deathe. Cap. i. This statelie, brawe, and weill disposed, this gallant, glorious Dame, that is a naked spreit and peace of earth within the same, Who sometymes was the Pillar heigh, the fortrest full of store of Valeur, and of worthines, returned bak with glore Moist Ioyfullie from these hir wayes, triumphing over hir foe, that all the world dois with his craft and his desait ourthroe; And not with other armes or strenght this foe she hes subvert than with a visage fair and mylde, and with a chaistly hart, With thoughts most poore, with speache most wyse, with langage most discr[eit], that ay wer freindis to honestie, with shamefastnes repleit. A wounder great it wes to sie, a thing bothe strange and rare, the armes, the bow, the shafts of lowe for to ly brokned thair, And round about him to aspye sa manie thair lye slane, with manye captiwed presoners that did in lyfe remane, This ladie with hir chosen folk bak makking thair retrait from hir Triumphant victorie marche vnder clothe of stait; In number few hir people were, this is no strange to heir, becaus that trew and solide glore is seildome sene appeir; Yit everie one who wes with hir deserued worthie praise in historie, in loftye verse, in statelie style and phraise. At that tyme was thair Enseing?ie, within a feild of grene ane Ermind whyte depainted was, all lyllie whyte and clene, Whose nek did beare a Topas chane insert with fynest gold, To witnes weill that Puritie which they did alwayes hold. No humane pace nor earthlie stepps thair walking was &amp; trace, bot hevinlie all, and all thair wordis wer full of hevinlie grace. O blist be these! weill be these blist! and happie thryse agane that to suche destine creat be and such good fate sustane! As Twinkling starris they all appered in midst a Sun of light, decoring thame evin with these beames which daisled not thair sight; Thair headis with garlandis wer bedect of reid incarnat rose, with violes of brawest hewis, and flouers of brawest chose; And as a noble gentle hart great glorie dois obteane, so did this Ioyfull cumpanie with Ioy eache fitsteppe trane. Quhen then I saw, evin suddanelie, a banner borne of blak, and in the same, of that same hew, a furious woman shak; Sad, paill, obscure, and sensles shee appeared, alace, to me, with fureis wrapt and fureis worne at that tyme seamed shee; The sight heirof so hideous was as skairslye I can tell gif suche a sight at Phlegia was when that The Giantis fell. Than did this grei?elie, ghaislie ghaist addres hir to me dame, with trotting trace and haistie voyce did call hir by hir name: “O ladie fair, that so dois go decord with youthe and grace, and dois not knaw of this thy lyfe the fixed terme and space, I she am she that importune and Cruell cald by yow, who ar a people deafe and Blind, and makis all creaturis bow, Who fearfullye dois all arrest evin be my force and might, that shortis the day, and haistis before or evening come the night; I she am she that hes conwoyed the Greikis vnto thair end, The Troians and the Romans to I haif maid to discend Within thair dreidfull grawe and tombe be this my fatall brand, That sheares and slayes, that prikis and cuttis, and killeth owt of hand, With manye other people moe, both Barbar, gross, and strange, arryving first before they know thair lyfe for death to change, Ransakking all thair pansiwe thoughts long ludged in thair mynde, and brakking doun thair vane conceattis to death they haif declynde. And now to yow, when yow must list to liwe in lyfe so long, I do adres my deidlie course with deadlie Dart and strong, Before dame fortoun with hir wheill in sum vnhappie houer with luckles happ ourcross your hope, and mixt your sweit with souer.” Than answered she who was within this world onlye one, “thow hes not in these cumpaneis no right nor reasoun none; Thow may in me far less pretend, bot gif that thow wilt haiff, The onelye spoyle is that thow shalt my corss conwoy to graiff. Bot thair is one who sall hawe more displeasour be my deathe, For in my weilfair and my helth depends his lyfe and breathe. It sall to me most thankfull be from this world to goe, which is the Port of Miserie, and harbrough for our woe.” Than as a man who bendis his eyes on vncouthe things &amp; new, and seing thame more than first he spyeth far vtherwayes ensew, With wounder is astonished, and than him self dois blame, so dois this ferse and cruell death with wounder pause for shame; And as be chance she mused awhyle these words at lenth she spak, “I know the tyme wherin my teith ar drest to spoyle and sak.” So afterwart with calmie face, less vglie than before, she thus began to speik: “o dame, adorned so with glore, That dois conduct this chaistlye band, yit though thow hes not knowen my poysned shafts and deidlie dartis which many hes ourthrowen, if to my counsell at this tyme thow bothe gif trust and eare, what I enforce is for the best, and so it sall appeare. Ould, harie, lothesom, crooked age I far from the sall chase, with all the cairis and fashereis that dois with age recrease; I am resolwed and purposed now suche honour the to doe, Sawe the to none was never before such fauour shawin vnto; Thou shalt exchange thy lyiff for death, thy spreit sal part but feare, no sorrow thairby sall thow feill, Nor dollour sall the deir.” This earthlie Sant this spak agane: “evin as it pleass the lord that standis in heavin to rewll from thence all thingis in gude accord, Who gowerneth all this vniuerss, and reullis this massiue round, do he to me and in suche sort as other folkes hes found.” Thus as she spak: then suddanlie behold the spacious place was quiklye with deid bodeis filled whom death did so deface; The number was so hudge and greit as none culd hawe tham pend, suppose he shuld in prose and verse thame prease to comprehend; Of India, Cataia, with Marracos, and of Spane, of all these people wes the midst replenisht with the plane; The lowest partis and hollow place the multitude vpfilled, whom death with longer tract of tyme had cruellie so killed. Thair was these men whom men most cald most happie &amp; most blist, Triumphant kingis and empreouris, and Popes whose feit men kist, Who now lyes spoyled of thair Pompe and skant dois plague þair pryd, and poorer ar then beggaris be who oft for crommes hes cryed. Now tell me than, whair is thair welth, whear is thair glorie great? Whair ar thair Gems and pretious stones, and Sceptaris of estait? Whair ar they now? whair ar they gone? whair ar thair princelie crownis? whair ar thair forked myters now? whair are thair purple gownis? O wretched he, and Miser more, that fixis so his trust on mortall things to which all men that mortall be hawe lust! But who is he that dois not so? yit they salbe in end with reasoun iustlye scorned and scuft that to that course did tend. O blinded folk to toss yow so! what Ioy can yow befall? vnto your mother ould yow must returne bothe one and all, And than your titillis and your stylis sall so obscured lye, that yow sall all forgotten be, none sall yow hawe thairbye. Than tell me now for what effect do yow youre cair intend, although one gane for thousand panis do to yow ryse in end; Who dois not sie [that] all is vane, a folye flatt exprest? Or what awaillis that be your force suche countreyis be posest Which ar not yours, and Tributare to mak the strangeris sole, with dommage of your corpss and soule that for your sinnis sall thole? Or after perrellous interpryse, bothe bloodye, vane, and wrong, To purchess land be loss of bloode that dois yow not belong? Or yit to muk and gather gold, and so your handis defyle? It better for your soules had bene to liwed with breid this whyle, And water more had yow beseamed, rough treis, and brittill glass had more besett than Gems and gould in which your glorie wass. Bot now will I draw in my saillis and to my purpose Turne, which is the subiect of my woe that makis me so to murne. So when I say the houer was come, Alace, that latter houer of that hir short and glorious lyfe which death did so dewouer, Wherein she must that doubtfull pace and passage than assey, whereof the fearfull world standis in dreid and in a fray, Thair cam a troupe of valerus dames, a band so chaist and fair, To sie if this fair ladie lewed, or deathe hir lyfe would spair; About hir bed they gathered thame to mark and vew the end To which bot ones, bot no more oft, must all inclyne and tend. As all hir freindis and nighbouris neir hir bewtie did behould, death rooted wp and did dissolue hir hair as fyne as gould, So that the choisen fairest flouer that in this world did sprout, death fouly to the worldis disgrace did rywe and pull it owt, Nor for to hate nor yit Envye that he to it did beare, but that in thingis most excellent his pouer might appeare. Sore sad laments, and sparpled teares, deip sighs, and reuthfull cryes was thair amongs these wemen all that rave to reuth the skyes. O what a hart brek was it to see these eyes so fair and bright for which I manye a Sonet maid to lose thair lucent light! Betuix sa manye scalding sighs and havie layes of woe, betuix sa manye shrilling shouts and sobbis in number moe, That hevinlie Dame, that Ladie fair, did peacelye sit but bruit, and of hir vertewis deidis did rype the glorious gane &amp; fruit. “O mortall goddes, go thow hence! in peace dois thow depairt!” so said the people who wer thair with sad and murnfull hart. “Quhat sall be cum or yit befall to others, mortall wights, sen suche a dame hes brunt and fresed, and past in such few nights?” Thair speache forsuith deserwed praise, bot it not muche awaild against that death that in hir rage so roughlye hir assaild. O Trustles hope of humane thingis! O hope bothe blind &amp; vane! Incerten ar thow in thye course, and so sall ay remane. If that for pittie of hir death the earth was washt with teares, as he best knowest who saw it so, so lat him think that heares. It wes the sex day of Appryle, thairof the Primal houer, in whiche my fervent flam began be cupids puissant pouer; And looke what houer she did me in her loyall lowe insnair, The self same tyme now by hir death renewed hes my cair; Att that same day that hes me bound the same hes sett me frie, As fortoun in hir fickill course hir style dois change we sie. None evir yit did so complane, none ever so bewaild his fredome lost, or dreidfull death that over him prewaild, Than I of this my libertie brought by hir loss of lyfe, whose threid by gretar richt suld bene first cutt by fatall knyfe: For thow suld first, o death, me kild, my debt by age wes dew, that formast stood vpoun that front from which hir glorye grew. Who can beleif my doolefull woe, my dollour, and my cair, my sadnes, and my loude lamentis, my sorrow, and dispair? No none thair is Imagine may the greatnes of the same; how than can I in prose and verse them bouldlye furth proclame? These ladeis fair that stoode about that ladeis chaistlie bed, with wofull woe, with murning mone, and cheikis with teares ourspred, Began to crye, “now, now, alace! Dame vertew is decayid, fair Beutye now hes lost hir lampe, and courtsie is astrayed. Woe! woe! alace! who sall ws sawe? what sal be come of ws? since she is deid what sall we hope, who sall this doubt discus? Who evir saw in suche a dame suche perfyte proofes of praise? who evir hard so sweit a speache so full of wit alwayes? Who evir hard, or yit did sie, though he suld liwe to long, from suche ane Angell Angellis voyce so Angelic a song?” Her spreit before it did depairt from bosome of hir rest, and from that place which to toe short it shortlie had possest, With all his vertewis and his giftis conioyned vnto one, did light the air in euerie part, and cleir the heavinis anone; Nor none of all the furious Spreittis durst than ones vndertak for to compeir before that dame with visage foule and blak, Before, alace, that dreidfull death, that dame but blame or fault, vpone hir chaistlye cumelie corss had finisht his assault. Bot after they had end thair plaintis and left thair lowde lament, and by dispair war maid seceur, they had thair eyes all bent Vpon hir visage meik and myild, and markt hir angellis face, Most bewtifull, most angelik, and full of hevinlie grace. Not as a fyre of flamming flame blawen owt by busling blast, bot as a spark that through hir self consumis and deith last, And as we sie a sweit cleir light that cummeth to decay, whose nurishing by peice and pece dois softlye weir away, And to the end hir ancient vse and custumes keipis eache on, So to hir fading deing lyfe hir deing day drew on. And so but pane so dyed my Dame, hir lyfe so past and went, hir hevinlie soule to hevinlie rest in peace did pairt content. Not Paill that lowely ladie lay, bot whytar than the snow which gathered is in flokkis but winde, and dois togeather row; And as a man through Trawell long and exercise is faint, in suche a sort my ladie lay when deathe did hir attaint. Her soule than being parted so, that which maid foolish men Callis vglie death a plesant Sleip did in hir eyes seme then, So that that deidlie Monster wyld, that dois all folk disgrace, did than appeir most bewtifull within my Ladeis face. Finis .i. cap. The Secounde chapter of the Triumphe of Deathe. The night that after did ensew this wofull vglie chance, that deathe my dame so suddanlie did to hir grawe adwanse, That night in maner maid the Sun his lucent light to lose, and sped him from the earth in haist in heavin to repose. So being left I knew not weill whose fitstepps for to trane, I lost my guyde, and I did lyke a blinded man remane. Quhen that the sweit and sommer frost was sparpled by the air, and quhill Aurora did begin agane to earth repair, That dois despoyle and tak away evin by hir wholesome streames the coverture and mantle braid of fals confused dreames, Evin at that tyme a ladie fair did to my sight appeir, resembling right on euerie point the season of the yeir. Sche was bedect with precious pearle, and crouned with orient stones, yea, crowned she was with thousand crownes of Iewellis brawe at ones, Who, moweing softlye in hir self, she towardis me did walk, and lowinglye besydis my syd did sett hir doun to talk, And streatching owt hir plesant hand, that hand so long desyrd, she sighing, speiking, yeild it furth, and me to speik requyrd: From whense his rissen the pleasant Ioy &amp; that eternal bliss that in my woefull havie hart so long so ludged Is. “Knowst thow not hir,” thus spak my dame, “who first thy wandring pace hes turnd asyid from vulgar way and from the vulgar race? Knowst thow not hir who the withheld from that which youth did rage, whose chastlie hart both caused thy lowe and als thy lust did swage?” This pansiwe dame, in deids most wyse, and in hir actis discreit, satt doun quhair meiklie she did me to sit with hir intreit: It was a pleasing bank that place whairon we than reposed, with laurell grene and branchely beach ourshadowed all and closed. Than answered I euen as a man who speiking shedds his teares, and through the greitnes of his greiff his toung from talk forbeares: “O Laura, thow! O Ladye fair! O goddes of my mynd! my eyes dois knaw the verie weill, o glore of womankynd! Tell me, my Dame, tell, hevinlie soule, from whense my grace dois grow, if thow be leving or yit deid becaus I long to know.” “I am in lyfe, not deid,” sayis she, “I liwe, and thow is deid, and salbe whill the later houer that death to earth the leid. And now, for that the tyme is short our will is alwayes long, I counsell that thow It that so thow go not wrong; Lose not the brydill to the same, thy speache to goode employ, before the day that draweth neir the to thy grawe conwoy.” Than I in end replyed thus: “tell me, my hevinlie dame, that now of lyfe and death hes prowin the practise of the same, And knowst the proofe what is to liwe and what to die agane, if death a thing so feirfull be, or yit so full of pane.” Than answered she: “so long as thow with vulgar folk will hould, whose iudgement is ay wauering, and to thair will Inthrauld, And thair opinionis so embrace that blinde ar, hard, and auld, thow nevir happie salbe named nor blissed salbe cald. To noble spreittis and gentle myndis death is the end of cair, of presoun strong, of Dungeonis dark, of dollour and dispair; Bot vnto these who hes thair thoughts so fixt on earthlie things, to suche eternall noy and sturt and sorrow death inbringis. And this my woefull doolefull death for which thow hes lament, for whiche thow hes sae manie teares so vanelie shed and spent, I am assured suld confort the, and quyte efface thy noy, if that thow felt the thousand part of this my hevinlie ioy.” Quhen thus she spak she cwist hir eyes vnto the highest heavin, and then her roselye lipps war closed, and I to purpose dreavin, “O dame,” said I, “these tyrantis strong that rewld that last empyre, as Sylla, Marius, nero vyld, that sett all Rome in fyre, Calligula, Maxentius, with murder so acquent, that daylie so to torture men all Tormentis did Invent, The burning boyling feaveris whote, the seiknes in the breist, the sorenes in the Li?s and nervis that so dois men molest, Makis death for to accounted be with euerie one and all abhorred be, and so estemed more bitter than the gall.” “I can not weill denye,” sayis she, “but that the pane and woe that goeth before or death dois come dois mak ws think it soe; Bot that which greweth most of all, it is that dreidfull feare To loss our long and lasting lyfe, this is that most ws deare; Bot to the spreit that dois in god his confort all repose, And to that hart that for his sinnis his waiknes dois disclose, Vnto that hart, and to that spreit, What death can vther be than evin a short and litill sigh, as men dois breath we sie? The proofe thairof evin be my self most planelie may be prowen, who nerest was my latest course or death had me ourthrowen: When fleshe was frayle and bodie seik, &amp; spreit more prompe agane, I hard with heavie sound a voyce most heavelie complane, ‘O wretched he and miserable that rekneth Lauras dayes, to whome eache one a thousand yeares appeares to him alwayes! He euerie houer hes suche desyre to visie hir and sie, and, if he sie hir not euerie hour, he can not happie be; He seikis for hir through all the earth, bot yit can not hir finde, and euerie hour and moment small he hes hir in his mynde; He seikis for hir the fomeing seis, and searcheth all the bankis, the bayes, the brayes, the brookes, the floods, the deip and watrie stankis, Whair euerie he walkt or holdis his stepps, ay holding still one style to think on hir, to speik on hir, and verse of hir compyle.’ Than hearing thus, my fanting ee I turned to that syde from which that heavie sounding sound I hard and had espyde, And thair persaweth that Gentle dame that long thy passionis knew, that thrust me fordwart in thy lowe, and bakwart the with drew; The sugred wordis owt from hir mouth did mak hir knowen to me, hir visage and hir countenance did shaw the same wes she That oftentymes my wofull hart reconforted and glad, when heavines did it assayle, or sorrow made it sad; Sche was acquent with our effaires, with witt she was repleit, and fayithfull was she in our lowe, and at my deathe discreit. And planelie now I will the tell, Evin in my brawest state, and in my grene and growing yeares to the both brawe and feate, Which caused hes the thoughts and toungs of men to talk and think in praise of that which was the chaine that did in lowe ws link, That lyfe which I that tyme than ledd more bittar wes to me, and swetar than my gentle death that hes me maid to die; A thing most rare to mortall men, and strange it is to heir, that death to me more better semed than bitter did appeir; Becaus to me that passage wes more ioyfull and content than he that from exyle is cummed and to his countrye went; The thing that onlye dois me vex, and most my mynde dois grewe, Is that thow in this wicked world so long, alace, sall lewe.” Than answered I and spak agane: “O pretious pearle of praise, I the adjeur by that same fayth that all the world dois blaise, Whiche tyme I trow hes manifest and oppinlie dois proclame, and now the more in sight of him that liwis in lasting fame Dois more appeir, whose eyes dois perse and seis in euerie part, than tell me if thow ever had ones pittie on my smart, Or one the panis that lowe hes ludgt within my macered breist, or of the thoughts that in suche hudge did long my heade molest, Not leving of your chaistlye wayes nor honest interpryse, whiche yow wer wont for to oppone aganis my rauthfull cryes; For that your pleasant gratious Ire and these your sweit disdanes, So mixt with lowe and than with heate redoubling so my panes, Togeather with the platt of peace imprented in your eyes, the Seales of grace, the nest of bliss that all my sorrow seis, Did holde so long my whote desyris in such incertan sort, as ay my mynde dois stand in doubt disparing of support.” I skarslie had my wofull wordis owt from my mouth declaird, when as I saw a smyrcling smyle with douce and sweit regaird Pass from the passage of hir eyes, which sometymes of my Ioy was both the salve and medicine for to abaitt my noy. So afterhend she sighing said: “O Petrark, iust and trew, mark weill my wordis and credeit giwe to that which dois ensew: My hart nor yit my lasting lowe did euer from the depart, Nor yit that lowe my hart had ones death euer sall subwert; Bot warlye I prowydid so To temper so thy flame, with coy regaird to mitigat the fearsnes of the same, Becaus they wer no other way to keip in honest fame my chastetie and thye renoun of ewill bruit and blame; And so thow ought not for to think that Laura not the loved, or had not pittie on thy plaints or yit to reuth not mowed. For looke how that a mother deir dois chastise so hir sonne, correctis him for amendiment to frame in better toone, Evin so did I so vse my selff, and to my self oft said, ‘Petrarcha lowis not but dois burne, this fyre must than be stayd.’ It is my part for to foirsee these ewillis before they grow, less commoun bruit vnto our shame our Infamie furth blow; Bot so to do It is verie hard: for how can they prowyde against these things for which they feare and ernistlie abyde? Fame would ay evin as I did the to my lowe reclame, but slaunder maid me ay mistrust and feare a gretar shame; And to my selff I oft hawe said, ‘he markis but owtward thingis, yit Inwardlie he seis it not that so me woundis and stingis;’ I vsed this craft to draw the bak and spur the thick agane, Evin as a brydle backwart beares the Wantonn horss and vane; And yit this more I will confes, a thousand tymes hes Ire depanted in my face what lowe within had sett on fyre, And thousand tymes my face hes showen, and thousand tymes exprest, the sore conflictis and Inwart flamms that brunt my hart &amp; breist. And looke how muche thye lowe appeird so swirlie greit wes myne, bot Will did not my Reasoun rewll nor maid from right repyne; And after when I the beheld ourcome by lowe his rage, Than sweitlie wold I cast my eyes thy sorrowis to assuage, With purpose and with full intent, and with a cairfull cair, To sawe thy honour with my lyfe that languisht by dispair; And when the passionis that the paind so panefull did appeir, I purposed then to confort the with visage calme and cleir, So that my forrett and my voyce did for thy saiftye mowe, now full of woe, than full of Ioy, and dreid full mixt with lowe: This was the practise of my hart, these war my honest wayes, That I through honour with the vsed vntill my deing dayes, Now shawen furth a blythe aspect all gathered full of grace, And than agane a coy disdane, and than a sourer face. Thow knowst that all these thingis be trew, thy Sonettis this reveillis, and all thy songs proclames the same which of thy woe bewaillis. In end I vsed such sindrie salwes to salwe thy sore diseis, that bothe my cair and studie was how the to pane and pleis: For when I saw thy watrye eyes so full of streames of teares, which trickling doun in suche a pace did wash thy cheaks and eares, Than would I say, ‘this man dois rin a course vnto his deathe, I sie things thairfoir must help prolong his lyfelie breathe;’ And Thairfore than I did prowyde some help and honest ayde To eiss thy woes, redress thy soares, aud mak thye state be stayde; Then when I saw sa manie spurris so fordwart in thy syde, than would I say, ‘an harder bitt must mak this man abyde;’ And thus when then I so espyde how thow had hope of gane, ‘convenient is,’ said I, ‘this hope be drowned with disdane;’ So that amidst these contrareis, sometymes both whote and coulde, Now whyte, now reid, now blythe, now sad, I haif evin as I woulde Conducted the now to this point, though I now weryed be, Whair through I leid a glorious lyfe, and so sall all men see.” Than I replyed with face besprent and visage wak with teares, and tremblinglye with Trembling voyce all faint with thousand feares, “O glorious dame, of this my fayithe greit gane thow suld me giwe, gif that I could thy loveing words so steidfastlie beliwe.” “O man, o man of litill faythe,” she answerd in disdane, “gif thow not knowst which that I speik to be both trew and plane; Quhat reasoun is suld me induce to tell these thingis to yow, and thow no wayes that which I speik will credeit yit or trow? I wer vniust, o Petrark myne, gif I the treuth suld hyde: whils as I liwed thow in my hart and in my eyes did byde; In treuth, that sweit and loving knot most plesant was to me be which thow preast by fervent lowe with me to coupled be; That brawe renoun (if trew I heir) which through the world dois perse, which far and nar thow hes me wun by thy Immortall verse, Dois pleis me muche, for that I knew thow had no other suit than by a lawfull honest meanes to reape thy wished fruit. And this was it that onely faild, this onely did inlake, for to perfyte that perfyte lowe which did not thyne forsake: For whils that thow in havie act thy sadnes did bewray, thow maid thye flams to publisht be through all the world, I say; Hence came my zeale to mollifie, and so thye flame to soft; bot yit in all suche other thingis such concord than was wrought As loyall lowe with honestie dois temper and Immixt, so in my lowe bothe honestie and shamefastnes was fixt: This difference was tuixt thame bothe, thow publisht furth thy flame, when secreitlie I in my hart had buried wp the same; And when that thow for mercie cryed, so that thye voyce was hoarse, I held my toung, yit in my hart I had on the remorse. For shamefastnes vpone the one, on other syde a feare, did make my many whote desyrs far fewer more appeare; For nather is that doole the less that dois a nother vex, nor yit be Moning mone growis more that men dois so perplex, As nather thingis that ar of treuthe, and hes by treuthe thair stay, by fein?eit fortoun dois incress, or yit by It decay. Yit did not I dissolue these doubts when I with the did sing thy sugred songs that with my panis thy praises all did ring. And this muche more I will the tell: my hart wes ay with the, suppose my eyes wer turned asyde, and seemed not the to see; Off which thow verie oft complaind, as of these partis vniust, That quainsht thy hope and esperance and raised thy mistrust; Yit so to doe thow had no cause, for that of me the best vnto thy handis I did it yeild so that the worst bot rest. And know when that my eyes sumtymes war turnd from vewing the, that they a thousand tymes agane with mercie did the see; And in this same persuade thy self they on the ay had lookt, wer not I fear that through thair flammes they had rekendled thy smok. Now sumquhat more I am to say afore that I mak end, that may the pleis or I depart or I to go intend: It is that I in euerie point sufficientlie am blist, and yit in one thing (to my greiff) this happines I mist; It dois me greiff my natiwe soyle and birth place is so bass, from whiche I had my levinge lyfe, in which I gendred wass; And one thing more augmentis my woe, I was not borne besyde that floorish nest, fair Florence toun, in which thow did abyde; and yit my countrye soyle &amp; ground contentit much thy mynde, if not the place perhapps my lowe it was that maid the kynde. I wisht this change becaus I feared that thy trew constant hart through change to some vnknowen face and vncowthe be conwert, And so that glorious famous praise, which thow to me procured, suld darkned be so of les fame and bruit it had indured.” To this I said, “not so, O Dame, suche change culd never chanse;” and than the thrid fair hevinlie spheir did so me far adwanse, Evin with hir whirling circled wheill to suche a sort of lowe, as Venus stoode Immoveable and I might not remowe. Than answered she: “sen so it is suche glore I haif by the, that yit Immortall thow dois lest, and so sall follow me, Grawe thairfoir this within thy mynde, and in thy hart imprent, The tyme dois slipp, and through thy Ioy thow knowst not how is spent.” Alreddie I Aurora saw Ryse from hir golden bed, rebringing bak the day to men, and all the cluddis to shed, Alreddie than fair Phebus was mount in his golden cairt, and owt from the bosome wyde of Neptune to depairt, When that my ladie, Laura fair, from me was to resort, whose going than renewed my woe, and prayed me to be short, And with the tyme to distribut and all my speache dewyde, becaus she was not long to stay nor with me to abyde. Thus answered I: “O thow, my Dame, thy goodlie wordis and sweitt, so lowelie, chaist, and pitifull, so wyse, and so discreit, They mak me tak my panefull panis, my martirdome, and smart, my lingring lyfe, and havie loss, far in a better part; Bot this, alace, dois most me grewe, and this dois most me pane, that yow no more in Lyfe sall liwe, and I but yow remane; Now one thing thairfoir to me shaw, sall I thy futstepps trace, or sall a longer space of tyme my lingring yeares increase?” Than did my lowe, my Iem, and Ioy, speik so, as I belewe, “thow sall but me drywe furth thy dayes and long in earth sall liwe.” &amp; Finis Triumphi Mortis. The Fourt Triumphe called Fame. i. chap. Now after hend that cruell deathe had Triumpht in hir face, which oftentymes so ouer me Triumphed in lyke cace, And after that furth from this world my Sun wes taken away, and that dispytfull wicked beist, which dois all folk affray, Paill, sad in visage, horrible, and in hir countenance prowd, had bewteis light extinguished, which did all brightnes shrowd, Than lookeing so me round about vpoun the growing grass, I quiklye on the other part espyde a dame to pass, And nerar me for to arrywe, who drawis men from thair grawe and from thair tombe, thought being deid, in longer lyfe dois sawe. And looke how dois the morning starr at brek of day appeir, and cam from eist befoir the Sun within hir purpled spheir, Who willinglie dois marrow hir with all his light and flame, So in suche sort and all alyke approched then this Dame. Oh, sall I sie now from what scoole a maister sall proceid, that can at large descrywe what I do speik in simple leid! The heavinis about hir wer so cleir, so that through grit desyre whairwith my lingring hart wes brunt and waisted in a fyre, My daisled eyes, vncapable of suche a splendant light, war than maid less, and culd not weill sustane suche fair a sight. Vpon thair forheades wer ingrawen the valeur of these men who wer a people honorable; amangis thame saw I then Great sort of these whome lowe before had with him captiwe led as presoneris, and thame enforst his tract to trace and tred. And first vnto my sight appered to be in Fames right hand great Cæsar and brawe Scipio about hir than to stand; Bot who of thame was nerest hir I culd not weill perceawe, for one of them to vertew was, and not to lowe, a slawe, The other subiect was to bothe, and with thame both indewed. so after this beginning brawe and glorious ensewed A cumpanie &amp; rank of men, a people warlike wyght, with valeur and with armour armed, and full of force and might, Lyke these who in the ancient tymes, in high Triumphant chair, To Capitoll by Sacra streit or lata did repair; These all so orderlyke, I say, with famous Fame thame sped, whair thair in euerie bree and brow might than his name bene red, Who most through gretest glorye to this glorious world was freind, and by his valiancye and deadis obtened great commend. As I did mark attentiwely thair Noble secreit talk, thair gesture, acts, and countenance, behold, I saw to walk With thame two other in array, the one ones Neucis was, the other his Sone, who through his deadis did all the world surpass. Thair also these men I beheld who by thair valiant corss did cloiss the passage to thair foes, and staide thair force perforce, Two fatheris brawe, accumpanyed with the victorious sones, and one before and two behind so marched to thair thrones; Of whose the last and hindmest was the cheifast first in glore, thought not in marche yit far in praise the formest wes before. Thair after, lyke a Carbuncle great, Claudius flamd and shynde that by his counsell and his handis from Italie declynde The tempestes of more greit effairis, that secreitlie at night— as weill the flood Metaurus yit can weill recorde his might— Cam quiklye thair, and did defait Asdruballis sakking host, that threatninglie the Romane armes so threatned and did bost, Who thair did purge the romane feildis of that most noysum seid, and in this fact he had both eyes and wingis to mak more speid. Thair oulde great Captane Fabius did second him nixt fame, who by great craft ferse Anniball and drift of tyme ourcame; With him a nother Fabius, with thame Two Catois toe, two Pauls with thame, two Bruti als, and eik Marcelli twoe, One Regulus that lowed Rome and did him self more hate, on Curio with Fabricius, more fair in poore estait Than Midas or yit Crassus to, for all thair glanceing gold, whose auarice thair greadie myndis from vertew did with hold; With thame did Cincinnatus march, with him Serianus walk, not distant be a stapp or pace from thame of whome we talk. And thair I saw Catullus go, that great Camillus come, that rather lothe to liwe or that he did not good to Rome, So that the goddes him fauouring so did bring him bak agane by his great proofe of manfull mynde and thair for to remane, When that the blinde and furious rage of Vulgar people vyle did banish him from natiwe soyle and chaist vnto exyle. So thair I did Torquatus sie to giwe command to kill his valiant and victorious youth that disobeyed his will, And chosed rather to indure, to liwe but chylde and sone, than that the discipline of wars by him suld be vndone; Heir One and other Decius who with thair breists maid way owt through the thikkest of thair foes thame ferslie to assay. O cruell vow which with the Sone the father reft of breathe, and caused thame bothe offer wp thair lyfe vnto one deathe! Now Curtius with thame dois walk no less then those devote that to the Cawe did both him self and armour all alote, And filled wp that vglie den, alace, by horrible vow, in midst within the market place that trembling so did bow; Leuinius with Mummius Attilius was, with thame Flamminius who bothe by force and pittie greikis ourcame. Thair also was that Roman bauld who, bounded with a wand, the Syrien king within a rounde to answer did demand, And with his gesteur and his brow, and with his toung constraind vnto his will and his desyre which he afore disdaind; And him I spyed who all Inarmed alone did keip the hill from whense he afterwart wes thrust and hurled by thair will; With him also Horatius that did alone defend the bridge aganis the Thoskan force and brought thame to thair end; And him I saw who in the midst and thikkest of his foes in vane did thrust his hand in fyre his boldnes to disclose, And thair so long did it retane till it was burned quyte, for anger than effaist his pane and all his doole despyte; With him was he who first ourcame the Africans by sea, and with him had that man who tuix Sardene and Scicilie Disparpled all thair Nauall ost, and brought thame all to sak, and one part brak, ane other drowned, the rest did captiwe mak. I appius knew evin by his eyes that heavie war and blinde, against the vulgar sort of folk vnplesand and vnkynde. Than after thair I did espye that chiften goode and greate, the conquerour of manye realmes which he did all defait, Sweit, courteous, douce in all his deidis, who him behawed so that nixt to Fame and to renoun he well deserwed to go, Wer not his light wes neir at hand, and glorye in decay, and yit with ws Italian folk he might bene weill, I say, Evin he alone, as all these thrie was vnto Thebes toun, Alcides, Bachus, Epaminond, of fame and brute renoun. Bot oh! alace! to liue to long is to Suruiue to shame, and longest lyfe through lenthe of yeares dois shorten but our name. And him I saw who had his name for to be brawe disposed, and in his youth great valiancye and proofes of praise disclosed; And looke how Raw and how seueir he bloodye was and fearse, evin far more courtess and beninge was he whome I reherse, Whose manhoode was so excellent as skairslie I can tell, Now whidder he as chiften did, or suldartlyke, excell. Than after came Volumius who through weill knowen deids represt the ranckled swelling rage that wepeth sore mens heids, And swellis the bloode, and it infectis maliciouslye with byillis, and putrefeing the corss of man both plageth and defyillis. With him I spyed Rucilius, with Cossus Philon nixt, and after hend to stand apart this thikkest light betuixt Thrie valiant knyghts whose memberis war both lamed and hurt with wounder, whose armour wes both loss and clowen and hinging all a sounder, Luce Dentat, and Mark Sergius, and Cetius Sceua named, thrie thunderboltis, thrie fyrie flaughts, thrie rokis of wars vntamed; With thame wes cursed Cateline that did from Sergius springe, successour of a wrongus fame, and cruell, inbeninge. Than Marius after thair I spyed who Iugurth did subdew, and Cymbais with the duchemens rage and furie owerthrew; And Fuluius Flaccus thair I saw, who purpoislye did err in heading of these thankles men that so ingraitfull wer; Nixt him more noble Fuluius, with him I Gracchus spyed, the father of these other two who did the toun dewyid, Whose clattering nest and combersome the Romans oft hes rent, and wes the causs that so greit death and so muche blood wes spent. And him I saw who dois appeir to others blyithe and blist, bot not to me who dois not sie suche grace in him consist, Or yit to be within his thoughts and secrecie inclosed a closed hart on which all happ and mishappe is reposed: Heirby I do Metellus meane, his father and his air, That from Numidia and from Spane the spoyle and booting baire, From Macedone and Cretas Ile to Rome great riches brought, and from these townis whairin such loss and saccage he hes wrought. Than after hend Vespasian I spyed to walk with Fame, with him his sone, both good and fair, who Titus heght by name, And not that curst Domitian, vnworthie ay of praise; Goode Nerua, and Traianus eik, iust princes in thair dayis, And Helius Adrianus I with Antonie Pius spyed, whose offspring and successioun in Marius did abyde, Who had at leist to rewill and ringe a naturall desyre, and gouerne in iustice and in right thair noble large impyre. And whils with wandring eyes I lookt to spye the wandring way, I saw the first foundatour of the Romane walls, I say; With him fywe other Kings with fame did fordwart march and stapp, The sevint lay charged on the ground with Ill and all mishapp, Euin as it oft befallis to these that verteu dois forsake to follou euill and wickidnes and vnto vyce thame take. Finis .i. cap. The Secound chapter of the Triumphe of Fame. Quhen as with merwell infinit and suche a noble sight I was surprysed by deip desyre to sie these folk of might, And that good martiall people brawe who wer in world but pane, as suche a race within the same sall nevir appeare agane, I Than vnto my scrolles and bookes reioyned so my eyes, wherin thair names wer writtin all which wer in high degreis, And these of gretest praise and pryce bot than I quikly knew; my language was in nameing thame inferiour to my vew, So that my speache thair praise impaird or all them not reherst; and whils my mynd on this was sett ane other thought me perst, And turned my eyes ane other way, when as I saw encroche a trim consort of strangers stout more nerer to approche. Amongs the first was Hanniball, with him Achilles brawe, whose praise by Homer is depaint to frie from death and grawe, With frein?eis he imbroudered was of euerliving fame, These Troians two who by thair deidis demereted the same; With thame two Perseans great I saw, and Philip and his sone, that to the Inds from Pella toun established his throne. Not far from these I thair did sie ane other Alexander, To whome dame fortoun in his feght such succes did not rander, He ran not so as other did, he had lyke kynde of stay quhen fortoun from trew honour doithe deuyde her self auay. Thair in one knott the Thebanes thrie I spyed, as I hawe showen; thair Diomed with Aiax and Vlisses might be knowen, Who had to sie this spacious world so greit and deip desyre, and Nestor who forsaw so muche, and knew all that impyre. I Agamemnon lykwyse vewed with Menelaus thair, that threw this world by cursed wyiffis in greit debait and cair; Leonidas was thame amongs, who did with mirrie cheare Propyne a denner hard and sharpe vnto his men of weir, Bot harder and more horrible the supper he assingis who in a litill part of ground did work greit wondrous thingis. Than Alcibiades I espyed that oft did Athenis toun evin when it list him to rewolt and turne vpsyde doun, With sugred speache, and langage dowce, and with alluring words, and with his brow and forret cleir restraned oft thair swordis. With him was thair Milciades who tooke the yok from greace, with him his sone, Thunonus good, was marcheing in that place, Who with a perfyte pietie, and with a godlie mynde, did chaine alywe him with these chaines that did his father bynde. With these who so wer recompenst Themistocles drew neir, and Theseus with Aristide a Fabrice might appeir, To whome, alace, was interdyte thair kyndlie natiwe grawe; bot yit the vyce of these that so suche malice did consawe Enobled more thair noble deids, for nothing more makis knowen two contrareis than one by one by interspace is showen. And Phocion with thame wes thair, whom I abowe hawe named, rewarded evin with these alyke and equallie defamed; For so his thankles countrye men not caused him onelye dee, bot banisht evin his bouldest bones and maid vnburyed be. As I me turned thair Pyrrhus I amang that troupe espyed, with Massanissa that good king besydis him to abyde, Who semed to be than malcontent, and for to gottin Wrong, becaus he was not with his freindis the Romans plaist among. With him I lookeing thair did sie the Syracusian king called Hero, and thair than agane with him prease to thring Hammilcar, distant far from thame, a man both ferse and raw; and him who nacked from the flams escaped thair I saw, Riche Cræsus, king of Lidia, who teaches ws this tale, That no defence in fortouns spyte nor buckler can preuale. I also Syphax than beheld Tormented in lyke sort, and Brenus vnder whom did fall full manye a man athort, And he agane yit afterwart in spoyling Delphos temple was beaten doun and quyte ourthrowen to serwe for lyke example. In strange attyre and vncouth cloths, and in that thikkest band, this cumpanie wes thair amongs and with thame thair did stand: And whils I bakwart turned my eyes I spyed a sort of men all gathered wholie in a round, whair him I spyed then Who first to god wold bwild a houss and church to him erect, to dwell amang his creatures and for that same effect; Bot he that did compleit the same I saw him cum behinde, to whome this work was destitute, as we in scripture finde, Who from the lowest partis thairof evin to the highest topps did bwild the same, and mounted wp be manye Pinnis and propps, And as I may coniectour weill and so the treuthe recorde, he was not suche a Maister work nor builder with his Lorde. Than after hend I him espyed to marche within that place that with his god so homely was and Spak him face to face; Few wer they, yea, none ever was, that heirin so might want or with his god familiarlie so long a time did hant. Thair him I spyed who band the Sun evin by his potent toung, as beastis with thair bandis ar bound and beaten led and doung, So he did mak the Sun to stay his foes to tract and trace, till that he thame ourcuming all did all by death deface. O gentle trust! O noble fayithe of these that servis thair god, that all which he created hes makis subiect to thair nod, And dois not only mak the Sun within his circle stay, bot stable makis vnstable heavinis evin by one word, I say! Than after I our father saw, to whome was gevin in charge for to depairt out of his land by waistis and desertis large, And for to go vnto that place which was be god elect vnto the weill of mankyndis sowle and that for gude respect; With him his sone and nevew was who trumped by his wyiff, and Ioseph that was chaist and wyse and honest all his lyiff. Extending than sa far my eyes as I had force and might, beholding that which corporall eyes can not attane by sight, I Thair iust Ezechias spyde, and Sanson thair defaist, and him who first vpone the seis the Spacious Arke hes plaist; And him I vewid who afterhend did builde that stable tour that chargit was with Syn and shame by god his puissant pouer; Than Iudas good from whome culd none draw from his fathers lawis, who franklye for the lowe of treuth did rin in death hir clawes. Alreddie was my great desyre all weryed, evin content, and satisfied by these brawe sightis that so with fame than Went, When that a quik and gallant lwik did mak me crawe to sie, and stay for to behoulde the trowpe that Trimlie drew to me. I saw within that rounde and ring a sort of brawelyk Dames, Antiope and Eurithea, and so wer both thair names, Fair in thair face, in armour cled; Hippolita also, afflicted for Hippolitus, and pansiwe, full of woe, And Menalippe thair I saw; these dames so agill wer and reddie to withstand that force, that any Would infer That it was evin a gretast proofe of Theseus manly might and Hercules who thame ourcame by hard and doubtfull fight. I thair that Wedow saw who did securelie sie hir sone, whose happie dayes of gretest hope wer by his death vndone, Bot shee revengde the same with speid on Cyre who wrought the same, as she in cutting of his heide hes cut away his fame: For seing his vnhappie end, and als his shameles deathe, It dois appeir that be his fault he hourly daylie heathe So maid him selff to daylie die, and all his former fame to be supprest and buryed be togeather with his name. Than saw I hir who happelie did sie the toun of Troy, togeathir with that Virgine fair that did Æneas noy, And that courageous Valiant Quene, with one tress of hir hair knitt wpp when that the other hang evin sparpled to hir spair, So sone she hard that Babilon rewolted from hir croun did bring thame bak, and stayed the reiff begun within hir toun. With hir I saw Cleopatra, toucht with vnworthie flame, and likwyse saw I in that dance Zenobia of greate fame, Bot very sparing of hir glore, and of hir honour hard, in vsage fair, and in hir youthe of cumelie sweit regard; And lwik how muche she in hir age and bewtye praise possest, So muche hir glorye and renoun by honestie increst; Within hir hart thought womanlye suche constancye remaned that she thame caused to stand in dreid that others had disdaned; Hir visage fair, hir face most sweit, hir hair with helmet armed, abaist our emperouris hart and mynde, and courage queld and charmed, Althought at last he sore assayld and captiwe twik that quene, and maid hir to our brawe Triumphe a rechar pray be sene. And now suppose vpone these names I both be breiff and short, yit will I more discourse, and of fair Iudithe mak report, That bould and hardie wedow chaist, who brought vnto the deid that dronkin foolish Holipherne, and cut from him his heid. And sall I now lewe me behind or Ninus sall forgett, from whome all historeis beginnis, and not with thame him sett? Or yit is heir in that empyre whose arrogance and pryde conducted to a bestiall lyfe in It sevin ?eir to byde? Or Belus yit sall I oursie, from whome did errour spring, not by his fault, bot by his sone who did it first in bring? Wheare now dois lurk Zorastres that magik artis Invent, or yit these men who of our dwkes that in a curst ascent And frowar star did Euphrate pass with lose and shame also, Whose evill conduct in Italie emplasters yit thair woe? Quhair Is Mithridates the greit, a mortall foe to Rome, and our eternall ennemie vnto his deathe and dome, Who soldring wp his brokkin loss and his oft crased harmes, in sommer and in wintar fled befoir the Romane armes? I manye thingis of great reporte dois in ane boundell knitt: whair is he now king Arthure that at Table round did sitt? Wheare be these Augustis Cæsars, thrie victorious, one of Spane, of Aphrica ane other was, the last of Lorrane ane? Whills I so this victorious Fame triumphing so dois sie, I lykwise spyed tuelf noble knights his Palladins to be. Than Godefray cam syne a lone, a Duke of fayithe and trust, who maid a holy interpryse, whose stepps and wayes wer iust; He, he alone, that valiant prince did with his valiant handis rebuild that keped Cairles Nest that in Ierusalem standis; This thing, alace, dois causs my woe, this worketh my disdane, this is the thing for which I crye, and call so oft in vane, Is prydefull christians miserable;—goe! goe! yea misers now, and drink eache one ane others bloode with setled othes and wow! Goe wourke eache one ane others wrake and others eache distroy, and euerie one against your selff dois all your spyte employ! ?e cairles ar how that the grawe of Iesus Chryist remanis within the handis of fayithles dogs and Turkis who it retanis. Bot after these whome I did sie, if I be not deceawed, I saw but few, or none at all, that might renoun hawe crawed, That by thair art in planting peace, or skill in hardie fight, or doubtfull yok in hard combatt appeared to my sight; Zit as the chosen men behind and cheifest oftest goe, I saw in end of all the troupes that Sarrasyne our foe, That brought vnto our christianis bothe skayith and blushing shame; and Heguius, sone of Luria, did follow him with fame; The Duke of Lancaster wes thair, who with his sworde and lance a nighbour curst and troublesome was to the realme of france. Thus gasing on this famous sight, I at that tyme and space did lwik lyke one who did adwance his fitstepps and his pace To mak sum thingis he hes not sene, so I did fordward goe To sie gif thair war anye moe then these that I did knoe: Quhair thair I spyed two noble wightis who laitlye, oh, did die, Who of our countrye men wer glore and praise of Italie, Who wer inclosed in that band, and marched on with Fame, good Robert of Scicilia, king of vndefamed name, Who in his knowledge most sublime and foresight most profound did Argus lyke sie thingis far of and weill discerned thair ground; The other that did marche with him was my Colonna great, courageous, gentle, constant, large and liberall in his state. Finis .2. cap. The thrid Chapter of fame. I culd no wayes returne my eyes from suche a famous sight, nor yit conwert thame from these men of manhoode full of might, When that I hard one say agane, “Looke on thyne other syde, whair Fame and Praise and brawe renoun with other folk dois byde By other meanes than vse of armes.” So turning to my left I Plato first espyed thairin with honour first infeft, Who in that cleir and cumelie band did nerrest marche these sings, to whiche he narrest dois approche, to whome the heavinis these brings. Than nixt to Plato thair did go, so godlie and dewyne, great Aristotill, replenished with full and high ingyne, And after him Pithagoras, that homelie first did name Philosophye evin by the same so worthye of greit fame; Than Socrates with Zenophon, nixt him that aged Man To whome the Muses wer his freindis, as Troy and Argus can With Micen yit resent his pen, who song the long astrayes and errouris of Laertes sone and boulde Achilles praise; In hand cam singing on that Mantuan poet brawe, and strywing which of thame suld first the way and passage hawe; The one I spyed whose stepps the grass transformed in a flour, Mark Cicero, who cleirlie shawes what fruit, what force and power Hes eloquence and ornat speache, so that these two be thame, which wer the eyes of Latine toung, hes lightned muche the same. Than after cam Demosthenes, all in a flame he went, disparing of the formest place and not with nixt content; Nixt him was Æshines in preiss, who thair might weill hawe knowen in what respect his voyce was hoarse and by the other ourthrowen. I can not weill in ordour tell whome first I saw and when to follow or yit go afore amangs these leirned men, For windring at Ten thousand things of that fair trowpe and band, my eyes and thoughts did both astray and wer not at command. I Solon saw who of goode lawis establish[t] first the plant that now soe will manwred Is, and dois hir fruit now want; With him these other leirned Sax, the grecian sax and wyse, of whome dois greik so noblye vaunt and yeildis thame first the pryse; With these I also did behold him whome our countrye men as chiften had for to conduct thame evin with other Ten, I Varro meane, the thrid greit light of Romans high ingyne, whome more that I in face beheld he semed more to shyne. Crisp. Salust than appered nixt, with him I Liuius spyed, who frowardlie did him regaird and greitlye him Inwyed. Whills I thame than did sie, behoulde than quiklye did I sie Greit Plinius his nighbour nixt and marrow for to be, Who tooke more cair to wryte his bookes than to forisee his death, whom Somma hill with brinstone blasts did stopp his vitall breath. Than after I Plotinus saw, one learnd of Platois sect, who trusting secreitlie to liwe did for the same effect With draw him quietlie apairt with no man to be sene; bot him his fearse and cruell fates and desteneis did prevene, Which he contraited in hir wombe from whense he first did come, so not his foresight him awaild, this was his fatall dome. Than Crassus, Galba I beheld, Calvus with Pollio, Hortensius with Antonius, who so in pryde did go To arme thair toungs and scharpe thair mouthes in Cicerois disgrace, and searcheing for vnworthie fame did falslye thairs incress. Thucicides I lykwyse saw that weill distings the place, the tyme, togeather with the feates, the querrell, and the cace, And trewlie tellis be whose mens bloode so feirslye shed in store the barren feildis was fertill maid and fatter then before; Herodotus I lykwyse saw of all Historiens greik the father, that thair workis full wreitt and trewlie of thame spak. And Euclide, geometrien, that dois depaint most sound Triangls with the quadrat formes, the Circles, and the round; And Porphir quho aganist the trewth became as hard as stone, who with his Silogismes vntrew and fals he did compone Assaild to shake the rockis of treuth, bot in Dialectik quick, and fild the same with argumentis in number great and thick. I also saw Hipocrates, both bred and borne in Co, that more had maid his workis perfyte and far more better so If that his subtill Aphorisms had weill bene vnderstand. Appollo than with Æsculap I saw than neir at hand, Bot thay war plaist abowe my sight, with tyme war worne away, so nather by thair face nor name I culd thame know, I say. Than Galene great of Pergame toun did follow nixt that band, of whome did hinge that noble art on which our helth dois stand, That now amangs ws lyis abused, so clene corrupt and waist, vyle, abiect, and prophaned now, by euerie one disgraist; Bot in his dayes it wes not so, thought dark it was and short, Yit furslie he declared of It, and largelie did report. I feirles Anaxarches saw, of manly port and mynde, with him Zenocrates the chaist, that nowayes him Inclynde Vnto infamous vyld attemps, bot thame withstoode eache one, So that in euerye point he did resemble a solide stone. Thair followed Archimedes nixt with visage baise on ground, and Democrit that pansiwe walkt thair in that trowpe was found, Who with his will and but constraint did with his sight inlake the light, the gold, the Riches great, whiche he did all forsake; And Hippia I saw lykwyse, with him ould Gorgeas, that bouldlye vanted that he knew all thingis that ever was; And after him Archesilaus of all thingis for to doubt, and Heraclite within his sworde more planer spokken owt. Diogenes I also spyed, so doggish in his wordis, and planer than more plesanter a scuffer in his bwrdis; And Anaxagoras I beheld who blythelie did regaird his feildis to ly desert and wyld of which he litill caird, Whiche he did deme to bring Envye, so that he thame forsooke, and charged with raches and with skill his raches he did brooke. Thair Curius Dicearchus was, nixt him wer other thrie, in discipline most different, and distant in degree, Quintilianus, Seneca, Plutarchus maist renound, that so in learning muche exceld as dois thair work resound. I saw a rowt of clattering men the seis of Treuthe to storme with contrare windye argumentis, not to the treuthe conforme, Who through thair erring vaginge thoughts wer famous maid and cleir, yit rather by contentioun than wisdome they did leir; They shuldringlie rusht other owt, togeather they did raill, as Lyonis two togeather knitt, and Serpentis taill by Taill. O now quhat bedlem men be these, quhat madlyke fools indeid, that are content with trifling toyes and further not proceid! And then I saw Carneades, who was of suche a witt, and in his studeis so expert, so reddie, prompe, and fitt, And in his speaches and brawe discourse his toung he had at will, that skairsly suld one be him knowen the right almost from Ill; His lyfe so long, his high ingyne, and greit abundant vane Did mak him than to vndertak with trawell greit and pane For to accorde these contrare sects that then war at great Iarrs, whom literall furour did conduct vnto such lasting warrs; Bot this he culd not weill performe, for evin as arts did grow, so lykwyse did enwy and stryfe and discord with thame flow, And with thair knawlege and thair skill, and with thair learned artis, arayse lykwyse that poysned spark within thair bowdned hartis. And Epiceur, who wold him self aganis that gratious man, who raising wpp mans mortall hope, I thair espyed than, Did prowe his soule Immortall be, that so yit epiceur that bouldlye spak aganis that man dois now greit shame indeur; Bot gif he preiss to challenge fame, what can it ellis more be than borrowing it from Platois stryfe with whome he culd not grie? And Lippus thair lykwyse I saw, with him two wer at hand that to his maister equall war that progrest in that band, I Methradore with Aristipp do meane, for thease be thay that in the Epicurien sect wer iudged best that day. Than did I spye Chrysippus so evin with a woundrous spindill and with a large and brodest roll his threid &amp; webbs to windill, Who by greit tyme and high Ingyne did glorious works compose, and in the same much learned skill did learnedlie disclose. Than after thair I Zeno spyed, the father of his sect, and for his ornat clerest speache abowe the rest erect, Who for to gif more proofe of It this sing and show did giwe, was opning wpp his hand and palme and falding than his Niwe. I saw Cleantes, who to stay and stable his intent did gentlye Weawe his brawest webbs on which he was most bent, And curiouslye, with earnist cair, to cairfullye prowyid To mak thair fals opinionis with Verite to byid: Bot I him leawe heir with the rest who did by fame surmont, that I more grawe and better things heirafter may recount. Finis Triumphi fam?. The Fyift Triumphe of Tyme. Furthe from his golden Ins and tent, afore Aurora fair, The Sun evin belted in his beames did from his place repair, And Isseued owt with swifter course than one Would evin hawe said he was abowe our Hemisphere vplifted with a braid; And heir a litill staying, than he lookes him round about, as dois the wyse and sagest men for thingis thay stand in dowbt, And to him selff with in him selff with rage beginnis to say: “quhat thinkis thow best now to be done, what will thow do this day? Now is the houer that thow sould hawe evin of thy selff more cair, becaus thow seis that mortall men, whose dayis dois death impair, Yit being deid do no wayes die bot by thair fame dois liwe, and by thair vertewus famous acts do far thair death surviwe. If it so be as it dois seme that law salbe in vane, that so the heavins fixt with ws so stable to remane, And gif the fame of mortall men by death dois more incress, which ought by death to quenshed be and quikly brought to less, Than of my glore and excellence must cum my fall and end, and suddenlie for which I rage sall all to ruine tend. What gretar wrong must I looke for, quhat worser may be fall, that I no more sall hawe in heavin than man on earthlie ball? So far inferiour is my state, and basser is my cace, That I might equall be with man, I crye of speciall grace; And yit four barded breathing horss with cair I intertane, and in the Occean tham dois feid so long as I remane, I with my spous dois spur thair sydis and whipps thame with my wand, and yit aganis me dois a mans vndantound fame with stand. If I war in the glorious heavins of Starrs not onelye he who first is of the Planettis all and highest in degrie, Bot evin the secunde, or the thrid, It wer, as I now say, ane Iniurie by hatred cumed, and not through sport and play. So now it weill besemeth me to kendle all my ?eill, and to my flight Ioyne double wingis that I may more prewaill. Now do I grudge at mortall men, I beare them now Inwye, I hate and now despysis thame, nor can I this denye, Whome all I sie, yea, afterhend a thousand thousand yeares, thay floorish more than in thair lyfe and famous more appeares, And I not more, bot to remane Environed with woe, and can not gett beyond my greifis, nor yit beyond thame goe; I am evin as I was at first, no better is my state, nor yit my glorie more hes growen, nor yit my fame more greate; And so I am as first I was before the earthe was plaist, ay turning in a circled scheit, day, night, but end, in haist.” When that the Sun these wordis had said with greif &amp; grit disdane, he than reseumd a swifter course far spediar more agane, So that the same more sudden was than falcon In his flight, that from the high discending doun vpone his pray do light. The thought of man may not attane, far les his tounge and style, for to Imagine what I saw with feare and dreid this whyle. Than did I recken all our lyfe most abiect, vyle, and vane, evin by his swift and rinning course which nothing might restrane, Whose solid course and movement did cause me Iudge much more the same to be contemptebill which gentle I held before. Whair than I thought it vanitie, a vaness wondrous great, that so our hartis suld liwe to that whose stay and whole estait Tyme dingeth and depressis doun, and whillis we more do think to holde thame fast, we leist tham hold and passeth at a clink; He thairfore who hes of his state ones sowcy, cair, and feare, let him prowyid and weill foirsee that so it may appeare, Whillis as he may through hevinlie grace, his hope so founded be and stablisht in a stable place of long eternitie. For when I saw the Turning tyme so gallantlie to go, and lightlye rin behind his gwyde that hes no rest nor ho, Whose swiftnes was so wonderfull, so infinit and large, that for to tell my toung nor thought be able of that charge; For thair without distructioun at all at any tyme I saw the frost with Roses mixt, the harwest with the pryme, And that which semed more wonderfull, I saw, evin at one point, the nipping colde with ferwent whote and fyrie flams conioynt; And he who with a Iudgement firme dois all these thingis regard, in tyme sall sie thame so to be; for which I litill caird In these my rekles youthles dayes, and in my lustie age, which makis me now dispyte my selff and with my selff to rage; For than my hope did follow muche my foolish vane desyre, and bothe my hope and foolish thoughts to folye did aspyre, Quhair now in eild before my eyes of Conscience is a glass, whairin my self and faultes I spye, and what sumtymes I was, And as much as I may see me to my deathe declyne, remembring of my litill lyfe and of my latter fyne, Whair in the morning I see me a gallant chylde and light, and now a havie, feble, waik, and aged man at night. What than is more mans mortall lyfe or longer than a day, coulde, cluddie, short, and full of woe, that quiklye waistis away? It brawe may seme and long appeir through outward shaw to be, bot all that fair apparance Is of litill worthe we sie. Quhat humane hope, quhat mortall trust, quhat ioy dois men so blinde, what makis these mortallis folke to be so proude in mynde, Or yit so puftlye lift thair headis in vanetie and pryde, and knowest not how they sone sall die, or long in lyfe sall byde? I now behoulde evin of my lyfe the flight to be at hand, and with the same the dayes of all whairin men liwe and stand, And in the swift and fleing course of this resplendant Sun, I sie the world wrack is cumed and rwine is begun. O lustye bloods, I sie yow now your selfis to confort soe, and in your folye all delyte and further thairin goe; Yow all ar cairles of your death, yow measure all the tyme evin with the largest, thinking it salbe ay in pryme: Liue for to die, think on your deathe, for deathe on you dois call; the hurt foirsene bringis lesser harme and doole when it dothe fall. Perchance I sparple all my speache most vanelie to the wind, bot that I tell for treuth it hould and keip it in your mynd; if to my speache yow tak no heade and not my counsell keip, your branes do all oppressed lye with heavie deidlie sleip. For this muche more yow ought to mark, becaus the houers and dayis, the Monthis, the yeares to gretar goes, togeather all decayis, And we with litill Interwall and litill distant space hawe all to searche for other partis, for other rowmes and place; Do not against the treuthe thairfoir your hardned hartis indure, as ye haif done and practised vnto this tyme and houer, Bot turne your eyes vnto your self, and spye quhair ?e offend, and prease your selfis, whils as ?e may, your faultis and sinnis to mend; Abyde whill deathe bend his bow or yit delashe his shaft, as dois the moist part of the world which is a band most daft. Than after that I had espyed, as I now cleir espye, the flight and chaise of Phœbus fair that rolleth in the skye, from which by Tyme such heavie loss and harmis I do sustane, I saw a sort and kynde of folk in silence walkt agane, But feare of tyme, or of his rage, or of his furious faird, whome Poets and Historiens did keip within thair guaird; The Sun had more enwye at thame, and bwir thame more despyit, who by thair knawlege and thair witt and verteuis most perfyit Wer mounted to suche topp of praise that never semed decay, who passed from the vulgare trace and cage and commoun way; In contrare thame he, onlye he, who onlye fair dois shyne, with gretar force did him adres to mak thame all declyne, So that he than began agane a course more swift &amp; greate, and to his horse redoubled wer thair prowendare &amp; meate; And shee of whome I wreit before, I meane the quene of Fame, deworst hir self from some of hirs who lyeth now but name. I sometymes hard, bot yit of whome I can not tell nor say, and this much also hawe I red and tane the same away, that all these humane worldlie workis, that Primprint may be cald, ar pittis of blind obliuioun whare darklye men ar thrauld; Ane other sentence hawe I red, that Phebus in his spheir sall by his force revolt, and turne not ones a single yeare Bot Lustres and that longer age of hunder yeares account, sall ouer the death of mortall men victoriouslye surmount, And by this revolutioun we sall beholde agane mens famous and illustrious fames to pass away in vane. For looke how muche they wer renound who wer betuix these floods whair Peneus rinnis and Hebrus slydis, and all these folkisincludis Of Macedone, of Thracia, and of Thessalia, that borders with Boetia and landis of Attica, Or yit so sunder distant be as far as Zanthus rins whair Troianis duelt, and Tiber now whairin the Romans wins; The fame of all these people brawe hawe haisted to thair end, and, gif not yit, they yit sall sone all to that Iornay tend. I hard lykwyse one say: “your fame no otherwise dois byid than dois a plesant changeing blenk shyne in the Wintar tyd, Whiche sone a litill cludde obscuris and brekis and maketh dark, and to great names great tymes to be a great and vennemous spark; Your Triumphs and your prydfull pompe sall all to dust declyne, your lordshippes sall all pass away, &amp; than your kingdomes syne; Your helthe, strenth, age, all mortall thingis, lyfe, fame with fair renoun, tyme waistis, makes waks, defaces, killis, distroyes and beated doun; And alss from these of menest rank sall than be tane away not only that whiche outwardlie tyme brought vnto decay, Bot evin thair knawlege, learning, skill, proportioned with thair witt, thair eloquence, and thair ingyne, sall quiklie from thame flitt; Nor yit sall tyme, who dois this world turne in his wandring flight, that never restis, not yit returnis, leawe of to shaw his might Afore all mortall men be him, both godlie and vniust, be all reduced to earthlie ash and to a litill dust. Bot sum may say, ‘sen humane glore and this thair famous pryde hes suche a multitude of hornes and prickes against hir syde, No merwell is that it be perst, if it soiourne and duell beyond the commoun custumed vse, this dois the vulgar tell.’ Bot lett thame pratt; if that our lyfe in haist did not consume, we sone suld sie all humane gloir to pass away like fume.” I hearing this, and now becaus none shuld the treuth with stand, Bot thairto fayith and credeitt gif but doubt or more demand, I saw our glore incontinent, our pompe and glorious show, to faid, to waist away, to melt evin as the Sun dois snow; And than I saw that Turning tyme to hawe brought bak agane the spoyle and pray of all your names which I estemed all vane, And to be of no importance, suppose the vulgar sort beleueth not, nor yit dois know, bot otherwayes report. O people blinde, that so yow playes and sportis yow with the winde, and dois on fals opinioun feid and errouris of the mynde, With gretar praise advanceing more that death that growis by age, than that which in the Creddill comes and futur greifs dois swage! How happie ar alreddie these that deitt in swadling bandis! how wretched more that through thair age death to thair grawe demandis! And some thair be manteneth this, and hold it for no scorne, To deme thame happie most and blist that never hes bene borne. Bot lett this people answer me, with errouris so acquent, that through the lentheninge of thair lyfe they seme so weill content, And thinkis thair growing age sall mak thair fames more famous grow, quhat is it worthe whiche they so pryse? I pray thame let me know— Confused dreames, and pufts of winde, vane fables, sturt, and stryfe, this is the fame that they do crawe be long desyred lyfe. So far is tyme so cowetous, and wars so much in wreath, that that which now is called fame he makis a seconde death, For whose defence and steidfast stay thair is no more remeid than wes for our first former lyfe, so swiftlye tyme dois speid For to Triumphe abowe the fame and glore of mortall men and of this world miserable, a dungeoun dark, and den. Finis Triumphi temporis. The Saxt and Last Triumphe of Immortalitie. Quhen than I saw no mortall thingis so ferme and stable stand now whether the same in seis may be, in air, or earthe, or land, Or vnder heavin anye thing bot totteringlie declyne, vnstable in thair trustles course, I left these eyes of myne, And with my selff vnto my selff to speik I than began, “one Whome hes thow thy hoipe and fayith now fixed, o wratched man?” My answer wes than in this sort: “Evin in that god and Lorde who fayithfull in his promeis is, all falsett hes abhorde, Who in his treuthe most steidfast Is, and in his doingis iust, and blissit thame of speciall grace that in him puttis thair trust. Bot now, alace, I know to weill, and to my shame I see, how that this blinde deceatfull world hes blindlinis scorned me; Now is the vayle tane from my eyes, I sie now what I am, and quhat in tymes past hawe I bene I now beholde the sam, And now I lwik how that the tyme dois pass, dois goe, and flie, and knoweth none bot evin my self for this suld blamed be; For that the fault cam be my self, who tymelie suld foirsene to opned wpp the lowring lidds and windowis of my ene, And not so driftinglie deferd, nor taryed to this tyme that hes to long prolonged my aige so cairles in hir pryme. Bot when agane I call to mynde the goodnes of our lord, and how from age all ages dois his merceis great record, Who of his hevinlie gratious grace wes never late nor slaw, on him I fix my confidence, that he sall mak me shaw Some worthie workis of ferwent fayith or I from hence do pass, or yit this catiffe combred corss returne to dust or ass.” Thus as I wes within my self discoursing to and froe— “thow that all earthlie mortall thingis dois in thair changeing goe, Who hes thair standing so vnsure, what than thair end sal be, that thus the heavins circled course do guyde thame so we see?”— This pansing so, and whils my mynde the more on this was bent, Or it semed to me that to this world a change in haist wes sent, In place thairof a new in age, not subiect to decay, Eternall and Immoveable, that sall no change assay. Thair than appered the splendant Sun with all the heavinis round, the twinkling starris, the spacious seis, and all this earthlie ground, With all thair bewtye and thair grace so suddanlie defaist, and in thair rowme a mirrier world and newar brawelie plaist. Quhat wounder and quhat merwell than did not my thoughts assay, quhen that I saw the moveing heavinis vpone one fute to stay, That never wonnt to stable stand, bot in thair race and course confusedlie all thingis to change, renverss, and to rebourse. And thair the thrie partis of the Sun I saw all brough to one, and that same one not haveing course, nor motioun haveing none, Nor yit to be as it was wonnt to speid him self and haist, bot for to be evin lyke the earthe, of herbis full bair and waist. For nather sall nor was nor Is, afore or yit behinde, nor such distructioun of the tymes that by the heavins we finde Sall more haif place, which wonnt to mak the lyfe of man with all waik, seiklie, fragill, and infirme, and bitterer than the gall; And as the Sun transparant Is owt through the glistring glass, so sall the thoughts of mortall men more through &amp; swiftlie pass; For they no fancie sall retane whairin the glass Is sene some obiect through the sonnye beames that so resplendant bene. O what a grace sall be to me if so that I culd gane that high, that cheiff, and souerane good, and thairto might attane, Whair is no ewill, which only tyme so mixis and Inwertis, and with the tyme dois only come and with the tyme departis! Nor sall the Sun more hawe his place or mansioun in these sings of Pisces or the horned Bull, which saesoun change inbringis Vpon our laubouris and our workis, in which they faid and grow, and gendered ar or ellis consumed, as we by proofe dois know. O blissed spreittis that ar so found within his holye queare, or in that hevinlie cumpanie so happie dois appeare, Who makis tham self of mortall folk to be Immortall men, and registers thair noble names by long eternall Pen! O happie he that findis the fwirde of this sharpe raging flood that lyfe is cald, to worldlie men both Ioyfull, glad, and good! O cateiff ar these vulgar sort, blinde both in eyes and mynde, that hes thair hoipe, thair trust, thair thought, to these things all inclynde, Which eating and consuming tyme so quiklye dois destroy, and nothing ellis dois leawe behind bot sorrow and anoy! O people deiff, in hearing hard, both naked, fraill, and waik, of reasoun woyde, of counsell poore, that Iudgement dois inlaik, Seik euery quhair, diseased in all, and destitute of grace! O mortall misers miserable, that knowest not god this space, That with the twinkling of his ee dois rewll this massiwe round, that calmes and stormes the elementis of contrars so compound, Whose glorie is so infinit none can it comprehend, no mortall wights, nor nather I, nor angellis that attend Vpone his Maiestie dewyne, who ar with him acquent, and of his glorie to sie on pairt for thousandis ar content! O wandring myndis that hingis in doubt and houngrie ay in end! to what effect dois all your thoughts to trouble yow intend, When that a moment of ane houer sall shaddowles leawe voyd that vpon which so many yeares yow hawe your panis employid? For that which long tyme past before or present is in sight, which was the strene, or yit tomorrow, in morning, or at night, Or anye vther course of tyme, all changed sone sall be, and not one point sall pass away as we a shaddow sie. Thair sall no more heirafter than Is, was, nor sall hawe place, bot only all in present be in nor this day and space, And sall eternitie be gathred whole inteir, and all such other obstacles sall from ws far reteir; And all these markis vnited of before or yit behinde sall quiklye thair defaced be that occupeid the mynde; Nor nather sall such obiect be, nor yit suche sight remane, on which our hope and memorie sall thairto farther strane, Which variant vew makis oftentymes impudent men to panss, and vanelie in thair vanetie to tak a foolish trance, Whose thoughts ar in thame selfis so vane, they think thair lyfe a play in deming suirlie they sall be to morrow as the day. Thair salbe no diuisioun of les from les at all, bot all sall ioyntlie be conioyned and framed in this ball; Nor after that great tryall day the sommer tyme sall last, nor wintar with the sturdie stormes and with hir busling blast, bot all sall change, and with the same evin tyme by death sall die, and all this changeles solid place that day sall changed be. For nather than sall haistie tyme, that waists away and weares, and swiftlye passis but returne, nor yit these present yeares heirafter hawe within thair hand the goverment of fame, that dois belong to mortall men, and purchest hes the same; But that which ones was pure and cleir sall ay be cleir and suir, and that which ones so famous was Eternall sall indwir. O blissed sowles and happie these that ar vpoun that way, or yit heirafter ar to cum that iornay to assay, Or to that end thair lyfes addres on which I do indyte, and with such zeale and feruencie thairof dois speak and wryte! And thair amongs these glorious sancts and Pilgrims she sal be whome death afore hir dayes defaist and maid vntymelie die; Than salbe sene before these sancts hir angelict discourse, hir honest wordis, hir chaistfull thoughts of honestie the sourse, All which Dame nature to hir praise, to mak hir more be graist, within hir young and tendar hart for honour had implaist. These faces fair that tyme with death had so distroyed and slane sall to thair flooruishing state returne bak agane, Whair then the visage of my dame most hevinlie salbe sene, whose loyall lowe so long a space did so me bound detene. And for that euerie thing sall be vnto the sanctis maid knowen, so thair sall I amongs that band whome lowe hes so ourthrowen Be pointed at with all thair handis, and euerie one sall say: “beholde the man for Lauras saik that plaind both night and day, Yit notwithstanding all his plaints, his woe, his doole, his noy, he happier Is than anye man that hes enioyed more Ioy.” And than to hir of whome I wryte and wepinglie dois sing, my constant fayith and loyall hart great wounder sall inbring, And mak hir merwell at hir selff, when all that hevinlie rowt sall hawe thair toungs, and all thair voyce furth in hir prais brek owt. Quhen this salbe I know not well, bot Laura weill dois ken, for that the credeit of these thingis belongs vnto these men And wemen who are of that trowpe and cumpanie elect, companions with the fayithfull flok whom god with crownis hes deckt. Bot sen these secreatis secreit be, who thairto can attane, or who sall then dissolwe this doubt, or gif ane answer plane? bot yit so far as mortall men coniecteur may or gess, evin as the day dois neir approche, so dois the world wax less; Quhair than the conscience of all men sall giwe a iust account bothe of thair fals and iustest gane before his throne and mount, Quhair thay thair laubouris, panes, and workis, and trawellis all sall sie the instrumentis vnto thair wrak and spyders webbs to be; Thair sall they lykwise sie and know how presentlie in vane thay plundge thame selfis in vanest cairs to conqueiss worldlie gane, And how to long, most folishlye, they tyre thame selfs and sweat, when so in end they sall perceawe thame troumpet by deceat. And at that tyme and on that day no secreit sall be than To cower or close, to hyde or shute, the hartis &amp; thoughts of man, Bot euerie conscience than sall be dark, duskish, or ellis cleir, and naked sal before the world and opned than appeir; And than that glorious god and Iudge, who weill these thingis do knaw, pronunce sall then his Iudgementis iust and sentence furthe sall shaw, Whair after It the godles men sall tak thame to thair way, as dois the wyld dispersed beasts, whome houndis dois putt in fray, Returne with speid vnto the woods to hyde thame in thair hole, so wicked men sall haist to hellis, thair for thair sins to thole; And at that tyme thair salbe sene, and on that tryall day, possessionis earthlye, ratches greit, and glorye without stay, High digniteis, and Princelie Pompe, to which men did attane, no proffeit nor yit glorye bring bot rather loss than gane. Bot on the other syid, the iust whom god hes tane to grace salbe vpliftit to the heavinis and thair beholde his face, For thay did brydle so thair willis, and vsed thair fortoun so, that it was rein?ed with modestie and did not higher go; Whair thay sall ioy in happines and in eternall bliss, but pompe or pryde or glorye vane that so men leadis amiss. These Triumphs fywe we on this earth hawe sene thame bothe and knowen, The sax, when it sall pleis our god, sall ws abowe be showen, Whair tyme that all thingis dois vndoe and bringis vnto ane end, and greadie death that in hir rage dois on hir pray intend, Sall both togeather be defaist, and bothe to death be brought, who by the force of thair impyre suche spoyle on all hes wrought. Bot these who mereitis lasting Fame, though quhill they liwed heir Tyme with despyte conseuminge It did waiste away and weir, And these fair lookes and bewtye brawe, that gallant sight and hew That death and tyme did palish mak, sall brawe agane renew; Obliuioun and suche vglie sights, so hideous, horrible, sad, salbe agane to thame restored, so felloun and so mad; and in a far more fresher age our soules sall than reclame Immortall bewtye ay to last with long eternall fame. Wheare then afore all other folk in that eternall glore, Ma donna Laura, ladye fair, sall formost be before, Whome now this world dois with his plaintis and with my toung requyre, and with my weryed Pen to sie dois earnistlye desyre; The heavinis likwyse dois earnistlie prease to hawe the same, that they may hir whole ioyned inioy vnto hir former frame. Thair Is a floode from Giben flowes vpone whose bank and syde thair lowe so long a lasting woe did vnto me prowyde, The memorie whairof, alas, dois make me yit to shrink, so that I tremble night and day and fantis thairon to think. O blissed stone! o happie grawe, that dois within inclose the fairest face of feminine, yea, of the world the chose! If I was happie than estemed, or Iudge my self than blist, when I on earth beheld thy corpss, or Death hath cutt the twist That did Prolong thy glorious lyfe, whois wrak dois work my woe, and causis so my sore lamentis my pleasouris to ourthroe, When sall I be when I sall sie the in the heavinis decord with glorye, and thy glorious corpss vnto hir soule restord? Epiloge Now with this work my panis sall end, and heir my pen sall stay, with earnest prayer to my god to leade me in that way Of lasting lyfe and livinge fame, and that I may forsake these trifling toyes and vane conceats that dois my vertew shake, And by example of this wight, who first this work dois wryte, my toung may speik, my pen may of the glorye of god Indyte.

      <field name="fulltext">THE TARANTULA OF LOUE Where versions of the same sonnet have occurred in both Drummond and Hawthornden manuscripts, the Drummond manuscript has been preferred as the most complete. The numbering of the editor, H. W. Meikle, has been used. I. O yow who heres the accents of my smart diffusd in ryme and sad disordred verse, gif euer flams of love hathe touchte your hart, I trust with sobbs and teares the same to perse; yea, euen in these ruid rigours I reherse, which I depaint with blodie bloodles wou[n]ds, I think dispared saules there plaints sal sperse, and mak the haggard rocks resound sad sounds. yet whils as ?e the causes reids and grounds off her immortal beautye and my payne, through which greit greiffs and grace in bothe abounds, with huimble speache speake this to her agayne: “O of this stayles thought the stayed sing breide him not deathe that glore to the dois bring.” II. The fyres, the cordes, the girns, the snairs, and darts, quhairwith blind love hes me enflamd and wound, the maist fair face, and the maist cruell hart, I weiping wryte, and sighing dois resound; and therwithall the beautyes that rebound from her quha is of dames maist chaist and fair, quha is the obiect, subiect, and the ground of my lothd love, and vndeservd dispaire, the sweit soure Iarres, the ioyes, the noyes, and caire, my perIurd othes, and my denyed vowes, her eyes, her hands, her hyde, her hewe, and haire, hir lipps, her cheikes, hir hals, and her brent broues, and things yet hidd, and to the world vnseene, to wryte with teares, and paint with plaints, I meane. III. Sence spreits, thoughts, harts, you haue frome me, faire, taine, then these lamenting and complayning lynes may Iustlye to your mereits appertaine, and dois belang to yow as dewe propynes; bot sen my style and muse not weill defynes, bot rather darks your prayse then right descryve, your Iust disdaynes of reasoun now enclynes to cast my songs asyde and thame to ryve, whiche now half deade I have reviud alyfe, and as the laymed birthe of my blunt brayne, whils your despyte dois theme of spreits depryve, I send thame to your plesant hands agayne, to die by thame, to perrishe in there yre, to burne by flams as they wer borne by fyre. IV. Pryde of my spreits and brightnes of my eyes, Lamp of my lyfe and onlye hartes delyte, hope of my paynes, sueit causer of my cryes, cheife worke of heaven, and naturs mould perfyte, glass of al bontye and of beautye quhyte, deare sant on earthe, and yet of heuinlye race, blist bright suborner of these theames I wryte, cleire schyning Sun which darknes dois displace, strong centryeis and wyde storehouss of al grace, scharpe quik reviuer of my slow ingyne, wha bothe my wills and witts reulis by thy face, receave these verse which humblie I propyne, and in theme reid that which thy beutye bred, whose wondars hathe me in my folyeis fedd. V. Iff great desyre the move to see my harte, mak in my breist a bore by knyfe or blaid, and there yow sal your beautyes al advert to have theme Maistres of my fredome maid; there sal yow see how fayntinglye I faide, and how my lighs, lyke bellowes full of wynd, dois blaw furthe deadlye sighs for laike of aide, and draw deip grones out of a mornfull mynde. bot, dea[r]e Bellisa, cruell and vnkynde, desist for deathe dois suche effects efface: behold my verse, and in theme ?e sal fynd my hart, my love, your favours, and your face, my plantes, my paynes, my longours, and vnrest, your high disdaynes to my disgrace exprest. VI. O most vnhappie and accursed wight to prayse her most who doith me most disgrace, or her extoll that by her pryde and slight dois circumvene me by a snaring face! and yet in all my greiffs and cairfull cace, plundged in the poole of payne and wheil of woe, by loving and by lothed verse I prease to eternise her prayse who paynes me soe shee, obiect, maks me obiects all forgoe which may displace or yet resent disdaynes; shee, subiect, subiect not, as wyld as roe or any hynde that in the woddes remaynes, dothe mak me of my self with shame reherse that I am first in love as last in verse. VII. With vncouthe flams lyke never felt afore I feile the pouars of my lyfe decay, and passions strainge more strongar worke the more I spye of deathe bot yet of lyfe no way. O fatal starrs, fearse destins of that day, quhilk gaue me light and lyfe to love and see and prayse the face that dothe al prayse despley, quhilk gendrethe love, and maketh lust to flie! yet in this curse quhat hap sal happen me whiche may requyte my love or quenshe my flame, to the belangs, Sweit Sante, (as lyes in the to haile and hurt) for to reveale the same: for looke in me and yow sall see appeare great fyres of hope bot gretar frosts of feare. VIII. Through feare and hope, through fervent flams and frost, through certen dreid, and maist vncerten caire, I have the flouer of age and youthe so lost as now my heade beginns to chainge his haire; nor yet do I forsee how tyme may paire, or yet the heavens deminish may my griefe; nor can I see how to avoyde the snaire quhairin I rin with ioy to my misheife; nor spye I yet quhat confort or releif can I pretend, or yet will shee extend, sen shee vnto my doole is dombe and deif, and dois my plaints disdainfullye perpend, and with her eyes, which sprinkleth frostes and fyre, maks reasoun, saule, and sence attones exspyre. IX. Perhapps yow think with your disdainfull words, with ruid repulse, with noyes reherst in yre, with threatning eyes, mair offensiue then suords, and silent pryde, to baise my high desyre. Reclame these thoughs which dois yow so inspyre: Love fearles is of deathe or yet disgrace, And how les happ he hopeth for his hyre, so muche the more his baldnes dois encrease. your beautye was the first that wan the place, and skaild the walls of my vndantond harte, which captiue now pynes in a catiue cace, Vynkndlye mett with rigour for desert: yet, nochttheles, your servant sal abyde in spyte of ruid repulse or silent pryde. X. gif mortal prayers move immortal pouers, gif pittie (love) may once with the prevayle, empaire my paines reviving att all houres, or mak thy flams vs equallyie assayle, no glorious triumphe nor trophe be my baile can come to the of my orconqueist corse, who never in my faithe did fant or fayle, nor rebell lyke resisted ones thy force: adress thy chariot and thy suift quhyte horse gainst her who vants hes murdred men by love; despley thy flags, subvert her but remorse, that doth a Mairmayde and Medusa prove; spaire me, vnarmd, quho at the first did yeild, and conquer her quho last yet keips the feild XI. O wakned thoughts of my incensed mynde, eternall noyes of vnconseumd desyres, O endles plaintes dispersed in the wynde, O sobbs, o sighs, my smokyie vapourd fyres, O eyes sent dovne from heaunlye thrones and fyres, the movers first of my mad mour[n]ful muse, O vncontrolled love, quho never tyres to sakk the humbled hartes and theme abuse, O trustles hope, deceaving with excuse, who maks the feblest harts exempt of feares, O vndecaying doole through ruid refuse, O fontaynes tuo of euerflowing teares, O vndermyning will which works my noy, possesss her hart that hathe displaist my Ioy! XII. But spurr to prick, but brydle for to turne, to quintescence great ioyes of gretest greif, to fyre a harte and not the hyde to burne, to steile a saule but takeris of a theif, to kill and save, to giue and stey releife, frie wills but cords to captiuat and bind, but blaid to drawe my bloode from senews chiefe, and to enflame a breist but fyre or wynde, In closest stokkes to hold a oppen mynde, but entrye in the feght to win the feild, and to surpasss all wemen of her kynde, mak wyntar flouers and sommer yce to yeild, to hayle to heaven through ioy and noy to hell, the wondars ar quhairin thow doist excell. XIII. Enflamed by hope, by frost attones I feare, and quhils my eyes do gase vpon my dame, and to her face dois glewe thair gasings neire, I grone and ioy whils toung no speache can fram[e]. thus hardned by the yce and melt by flame, I leiue, yet deid, seik sore, I find me sound, I fal and ryse, I stakkring stand for schame, I skayle the skyes, yet groveleth on the ground, proud in my self, an abiect I am found, commixting hope with doubt, I die disgraist, payne, ioyes, mirthe, mone dois fra my breist reboun[d], greif and annoyes my reason hes displaist; so that my saul displesantlye doth prove, euen at one tyme, a heaven and hell in love. XIV. Besyde these sorroues I sustened long quhairwith my spreits did faynte and senses faide, besyds your cruell thoughs, ay working wrong vpon my huimbled harte but feare or dreide, besyd the floods of woe quhairin I wayde, besyde the burdens of my heavye cairs, besyde these wonds which store of beutye maid, which skant of bontye mair and mair prepairs, besyde my great disgraces and dispairs, besyde your coy contempt and high disdaynes, I see new glewe, new girns, newe netts, new snairs adrest to trapp me faster in your traynes, and mak me crye, as feiling I do prove, “I did afore bot looke, bot now dois love.” XV. Bellisa keips vnder her calmye grace a thick tempestowous clud of blak disdayne, cold snowe in harte, and kendled flams in face, reuthe in her broues, bot rigour in her brayne; through her faire eyes and myne my hart is tayne, and pouring poysoun sprinkleth oh all quhaire, quhilk harte dois sulk as therbye I lye slayne, and cruell shee taks of my deathe no caire. her fretts the brightnes of her browes empaire, her frosts dothe pittie from her harte remove, her blushing yet decores her beautye maire, her hardned harte is rebell vnto love: yet howe muche more in her doit[h] [?] hardnes growe, so love in me more high and I more lowe. XVI. Ten thousand wayes love hes enflamd my harte, and nature greivd me with far moe agayne; yea, fortoun in my losses playes her parte, and with dissembled shawes protracts my payne. Love doth in hardest knotts my harte enchayne, and nature discords in my senses place, and fortoun crosses iust deserts agayne, and maks me cludds of toyes for ioyes embrace: so liue I plundge, yea, drovned in disgrace, and triple foes doth mak me perrish thryse; I see my wrak, and authours I embrace; Vnlovd, I love theme that my deathe devyse: thus wemen tuoe and a chyld forlorne conspyrs all thrie in killing me to scorne. XVII. Suld I not heate these harmefull hands and blame which shott the shafts of love streight in that part, that by the bloode that yssewd of the same is paynte her fatal name with in my harte? yet ar the wonds so sueit of that sueit darte, that seing thame the more I theme adore, and fayne wald kiss thame though they cause my smart, that the revenge might equal loss and sore. faire hurting hand, hyde not your hewe no more, whase quhytnes graces and dothe glad my vewe: and quhils In wonding me I tak for glore to perrish and to perrell by your hewe, how far suld then my ioyes and glaidnes growe, gif pittie anes culd from your fairnes flowe? XVIII. Vnto the Sunn her eyes I do compaire, which dothe resemble in euerye pointe the same: the Sunn his course hes in a spheire maist faire, her eyes with in my harte dois roll the same; quhils he dois schyne, the daye he doith proclame, her eyes my Suns the dayes ar of my light; quhils he declynes, obsceureth is this frame, quhils shee is gone, I nought dois see bot night; the Sun the starrs surmont, and is more bright, my dame in beautye doth all dames surpasss. thought theirin lyke, yet differs here there might: he, schyning, lyfe gives to this worldlye masss, bot yet her eyes, the fairer they dothe schyne, they drawe my deathe more nerr to their declyne. XIX. There never ran more fearse and ouglyie beare, nor cruell beaste in vnmaneured land, who, gif the Echoes of my playnts culd heare, wald not have steyd for woe and taymed stand; there never lyon was in lybia sand, nor hill so high bot might bene lowe and playne, nor bird nor fishe subdewed by lyme or wand bot wald have wayld with me my endles payne: yet onlie shee frome pittie dois refrayne, and voyde of grace shee laughs to see me loure, the humbler I, shee prouder growes agayne, and never will one dropp of pittie pouer. why hest thowe, nature, then thy worke invert, that framd her not a face lyke to her harte? XX. I fallowe her that fleithe far from me, and flie from her that wald me maist content; I leave the land to sayle on sands and see; I lothe the fruit, and feids vpon the sent; I thrystie am, yet from the wells I went; I may reape ioy, yet do I sorrow seike; I suit for grace, and will na w[a]yes relent; I mercyie move, and yet I am not meike; I speache requyre, and yet I will not speike; In flamms consumd, I am bothe frost and yce; I wishe my woes empaird, I others eike, and profferd love I had of litill pryce; I seike redresss, and will not giue releife; gaynde love I lothe, vngaynd I seik with greife. XXI. O quhat great power lurketh in these eyes which brings me deathe quhen I there beames behald! O how bothe sueit and soure ar these bright rayes which att one instant maks me whote and cold! proud eyes, meik eyes, which maks in doubts me bold, and dimmis my sight, and dois subdewe my harte, fair eyes which bothe dois plagues and peace vnfold, and by sueit discord dois my saule subvert. stey! stey! my faire, and do not theme devert which beares the message of my future payne; go! go! my dame, and theme no more convert to summond me vnto your love agayne; stey! stey! go! go! I wott not quhat I wishe, bot this I knaw, they bring me bayle and bliss. XXII. The day is done, the Sunn dothe ells declyne, night now appr[o]aches, and the Moone appeares, the tuinkling starrs in firmament dois schyne, decoring with the poolles there circled spheres; the birds to nests, wyld beasts to denns reteirs, the moving leafes vnmoved now repose, dewe dropps dois fall, the portraicts of my teares, the wawes within the seas theme calmlye close: to all things nature ordour dois Impose, bot not to love that proudlye dothe me thrall, quha all the dayes and night, but chainge or choyse, steirs vp the coales of fyre vnto my fall, and sawes his breirs and thornes within my hart, the fruits quhairoff ar doole, greiff, grones, and smart. XXIII. A DREAME. Is this lovs toure, is this this forrett brent, that calmes and stormes my discontented mynde? is this the Muskett mouthe of maist sueit sent, that lyfe reviud theirbye in me I find? ar these the eyes quhase brightnes maks me blynde, in depest of my harte ay kendling fyre? is this the breist quhair chastetie is schrynde? ar these the hands proud rebells to desyre? now in my armes I hald my hoped hyre, now in my armes I glaspe my gratious dame: contenewe, love, my conqueist I requyre. so in my sleip and dreames these words I frayme: bot oh! quhils wakned I behalds the day, my pleasurs past all with my dreames away. XXIV. I hope, sueit saule, to see at my returne the heunlye couleur of your angell face, which is the fyre and flamme quhairby I burne, and never is empaird by tyme nor place; quhair ?e sall als behold in me this space no other chainge bot that of haire and hewe; as for my harte, which livs in payne but peace, euen as it was, so sal yow find it trewe: bot quhat sal I agayne in youe revewe bot rigours, frosts, denyells, and disdaynes, and in that face (from which doth ay ensewe the streaming course of my vnceasant paynes) a farder fairnes with a farder pryde, which dothe my senses from my saul devyde. XXV. Newe wondar of the world, one mo then seaven, whose presence was my pryde and absence payne, whils this vyld pest in distance heth vs driven, I equal absence losss with deaths agayne: for quhen by her we mortallye lye slayne, to the immortall thrones our soule dois flie, euen so my harte in this impatient payne abondons this my corss and fleyes to thee. deathe maks vs leave the derest things we see, this pest depryvs me of your heunlye face; deathe cruell is, so absence is to me; deathe full of frayes, all ioyes doth absence chase: yet death putts end to all our noysome caire, bot in this absence myne revius the maire. XXVI. I tred the futstepps of a thorted gate, quhaire love me leades and doole doth me convoy In couleurs cledd conforme to my estate, with eyes In teares, and hart surcharged with noy. my second sunn, quhose presence is my ioy, by absence now maks darke my way and pathe; yea, senses all my reasoun dois destroy, and all is fallen that I buildt by faithe. quho then sall drye my teares quhairin I bathe? quho sall my harte deburden of his greif, and tak from senses the empyre they hathe? quho to my schaking feares sal giue releife? quho, quho bot shee, to whome the gods hes geven to be the pryde of earthe as pompe of heaven. XXVII. although this poysning pest, blak, rid, and paile, disperseth some and others als infect, and boith the cyteis and the land assayle, and terrefyeis with dangers and suspect, yet vnaffrayed these terrours I neglect. I have no feare of a pestiferous breathe, sen of lovs force I feil the full effect, whoe in my breist his poyson sparpled hathe. thus wayes prepaird I walk a cairles pathe, and baldned so I feare no pest nor boache, which by my senses may proceure my deathe: for so lovs venim dois on me encroache as no infectioun can infect my corse: for quhaire that pest is poyson tynes her force. XXVIII. Far from these eyes, and sondred from that face which with alluring lookes hethe me ortayne, I move vnmoved, I chainge vnchaingde eache place, and therbye thinks to mitigat my payne. and quhils I thus wayes fra your sight remayne, remembring all the moments that ar past, yea, euerye houer that I have spent in vayne in follouing yow quhair ?e have fled als fast, Vnto this dyell horologe att last I me compaire, quhaire love the neidile is, my hart the glass which schawes al grace is past, the threid my thoughts, the schaddow a reft kiss: See me quho then wald morning knaw by noone, I am the dyell, sirs, and shee the sune. XXIX. Though now no more I see for which I sight, nor yet behold the temple of my voues, I have not yet preaste to escape by flight furth of your yok, which nek and fredome boues: for ay my thoughs which chainging disavoues, trewe secretars of my affections all, and high extollers of your lovlyie browes, presents your absent schape more me to thrall, and in this distance dothe to mynde recall your rare perfections and theme right recyte, which maks all men in madness for to fall, and die for love as wemen for despyte: so present, absent, I my noyes renewe, And Fouler rins not Foule to girnis and glewe. XXX. if never for to ioy nor yet enioy ane spark of plesour in my fervent love, if vaynlye paines and pen and spreits employ the hardness of her harte to mercye move, or yet by absence seike for to remove my hope that by dispair dois more encrease, if euerye houer a hell of paynes to prove, and see for service trewe assynde disgrace, iff all these things may yet my flams efface, and quensche the fyres that burne within my brest, iff these things may devert or yet displace my thoughts from loving her hathe me distrest, then am I frie; bot this agayne sayes reason, he goes not quhair he wald who is in preason. XXXI. O thetis be thow calme and Iuno cleire! O boreas assuage the bosteous wynde! O neptune, whils the seas doth rore and reare, protect from rocks the maistres of my mynde! O phebus lenght thy light, stey not behind! O Cynthia expose the starrs to vewe, whose double brightnes maks vs confort fynde! O night destell of poorest aire the dewe! So night, starns, moone, sun, neptane, Iuno trewe, quhils my bellisa sayleth now on forthe, delyver her from dangers and reskewe who is this kingdomes glore and worlds worthe; And love guyde thow the rudder, sayles, and oare, and saiflye lanche faire lesbia on the schore. XXXII. Vnto the humeur of Bellisas harte I see the season of thir dayes applye, freshe in there hewe, yet cold in euerye pairt, obscuring by the cludds the clerest skye; wynds, tempests, haile, vpon the earthe dois lye, and vncouthe stormes expells his wonted hate; as euerye man amased dois espye some strainge exchainge and rare in there conceate, So my bellisa, on quhome steyes my state, by her soure lookes and by her high disdayne the calmness of my Ioyes doth far abate, not caring how shee doith proceur my payne: shee maks my eyes to hayle and breist to thunder, shee loths my love, and dois my lyfe dissunder. XXXIII. Euen as the painfull pylot day and night, in surging seas with tempests overtost, depryvd of Sun, of Moone, and starrye light, perplexedlye drawes narr and shunns the cost, euen so my tossed saule through fyres and frost, conseumd with feares, confunded with dispaire, desyrous of the eyes quhase sight shee lost, doeth covet more the causer of her caire: alyke far aff, nar hand, now heire, now there, succumbing in lovs seas I faynte and tyre; far aff, your face enflams me mair and maire, nar hand, your eyes dothe burne me in ther fyre: Alas! quhat paynes and plagues ar these I prove, to purches death for lyfe in this my love. XXXIV. Ar these thy weres O brave bellisa now quhaire thow vnto my wrak by theme aspyres? ar these the harralds which thow will avowe for to denunce the message of thy yres, to cast thy eyes that may subdewe impyres vpon that face which thow dois maist disdayne, and sighing sobb for to rekendle his fyres, quhome thow hes wrapt in euerlasting payne? will thow with me be trapped in lyke trayne? will thow with me this mater now compone, yeild love for love, giue lyfe by love againe? we sal agrie if thow amend my mone: bot this thow sayes, and brings for thy excuse, Love is the swetar seasound with refuse. XXXV. The rearding thoundars highest triees abate, and staitlye touers dothe with there fal ding dovne, yet they not ay contenewe in that state, nor yet they alweys furiouslye dois frovne; bot thy fearse yre is euer bent and bowne with sad effects my gladnes to efface, and maks me scheaver trimblinglye and swowne, and by disdaynes prolongs my deip disgrace. the godds there Iust conceaved wreathe release, and ar appaysed by a humbled harte; yea, plagues deservd by fervent prayers cease: bot thow thy thoughts from pittie dois avert, as nather may my treuthe nor traynes availe the rampiers of thy rigour for to skayle. XXXVI. Although the earthe dois bound the occeane sees, and boreas blasts disturbs with stormes the same, thoughe strands and floodes the tribut of theer sees dois dewlye pay to theme that theme doth clayme, yet for all this they dothe not proudlye frame there stormye face in euerye streaming tyde at euerye houer, bot quyet, calme, and tame, dothe thole the fleiting schipps on theme to slyde: bot thow, fearse damme, of fairnes ful and pryde, yea, beautyes sea to quhome the tribut dewe of teares, and sighs, of prayers oft denyed, I have deburdend from a harte maist trewe, dois rease thy stormes, and maks thy wynds more blaw[e], to drone me in lovs sees and overthrawe. XXXVII. Sad and displesed my sorroues I lament, and venteth furthe the accents of my bayle, and with salt teares I bitterlye repent that euer thow or love did me assayle; and since no plaints nor prayers can prevayle the rampiers of your rigour to subvert, I will my langour and my losses vayle, and pass my dayes but ather hope or harte. Loue maks me de, and deathe dothe spair her darte, bot in this sparing thousand deaths dois bring, for whils I so do liue I do advert newe subiects of moe deaths from yow to spring: thus lyfe lenghts love, and deaths draws on the more that thow dois me disdayne quhome I adore. XXXVIII. O might it plese the high supernall pouers for to redresss my sore afflicted state, or short my lothed lyfe and happles houers, which confort dois abase and ioyes abate! from day to day my dollours grow so greate, as love insists to wound me more and more; I rin so far I can not mak retrait; ther is no herbe may cuir or salve my sore. And quhils, faire dame, I do deaths help implore, I call to mynde that deathe will then deny; I pen your prayse quhome I with ?eale adore; ?ea, gif I die, we bothe sal loss heirbye, for yow sal tyne the obiect of your yre, And I the subiect of my high desyre. XXXIX. O cruell love, why dothe thow sore assayle my humbled harte with torments overtorne? quhat triumphs dost thow mereit of avayle in thralling me who is so far forlorne? and to quhat end is shee as yet forborne who, cairles of thy flams, thy bowe and darte, in her great pryde doeth all thy pouer scorne, and dois remark my flams with frosen harte? now through my loss I am maid more expert, and now dois see to be bot taels and dremes that thow hes Mars and Iove him self subvert, with phebus bright in his resplendant beames, sen that my dame, the glorye of myne eyes, dispyseth the, and dois disdayne my cryes. XL. Within this mortal vayle I coverd beare a solid doubt of ane vnsolid stey, with fearfull baldnes and a hardie feare, which doeth vncertene ioyes and noy bewray; Anonder pittyeis schade schee dois desplay the fulnes of her rigour and her pryde, quhilk to beate downe by service I assey, and trewe deserts which maks me more confyde. grace bids me hope, dispair agane defyde, hence courage comes, and thence dois feare encres, the ane alreddie quenschte and spent vntryed, the other growing on groues never less: thus whils suche contrairs dothe my lyfe subvert, I might sone perrish if I had a harte. XLI. I walk within this wood to vent my woes, remembring all my greiffs and endles grones, whils growing ioyes deip sad conceates orgoes, and loades my hart with love and mynde with mones: the playsant singing birds my plaints expones; my teares from springs and wells semes to discend; yea, baith the highest hills and hardest stones, gif eare they have, a eare to me extend. then att the aeks and allers that perpend my plaints I speire, quhat way will they me feid, if for to stey with theme I condiscend: “on grene,” say they, “for grene dois hope ay breid, which fedethe wrachles as by proofe they prove, and brings disparing saules some ease in love.” XLII. O nights, no nights bot ay a daylye payne! o dayes, no dayes bot cluddie nights obscure! o lyfe most lothd, transchandge in deathe againe! o doole, no doole bot certen deathe and suire! o harte, no harte bot rok and marble dure quhair wawes of woe with tempests stryketh soare! o eyes, which ay against my harte conteure! o teares, no teares bot of salt streames the store! o heavens, no heavens bot cahos of disglore! o godds, the guyders of my best hard happ! o dame, quho dothe depress all reuthe and smore! o nights, day, lyfe, o doole of deathe the trapp, o harte, o eyes, o teares, o godds, and dame, quhen sal her frosts be warmed be my flame? XLIII. If from my love thow partes, I will from thyne; if thow denyes it, I will it disclayme; if thow vntuist the cordes, I will vntwyne; if thow but fyre remayne, I sal but flame; if thow substract thy hart, I will the same; if thow contemis, I lykwyse will disdayne; if thow refuse, I will no more the blame, and if thow finds no fault, I will not playne. thow reules vnreuld, and so will I agane; thow fixed love, I vnprofest sal vowe; thow thyne, I myne, thow quyet, I but payne; thow scoffs, I scorne, thow drifts, I disallow; thow lovsse, I frie, thow mirrye, I will easde, so in this chainge we thus w[a]yes baith ar pleasde. XLIV. Aire be thow ferme, O fyre agane be cold, sea stand vnmovd, Earthe rin a restles race; deathe become sweit, that kills bothe yong and old; heavens chainge your course, your circles, and your place; rage, hete, disdaynes, wreathe, rigour, and disgrace, trewe lovers hartes content; lat theme for play there greate contempts, that does there ioyes efface, tak in gud pairt, and beare with all deley; Lat all things chainge and alter without stey; imposseble things posseble may be, sen these my flams be quenscht which boore the suay, and to to long of ioyes hes spoyled me: for now the cordes ar cutt and lousse the chaynes of my affectioun and afflicting paynes. XLV. Blist be that houer, and blissed be that day, that opned vp the wyndowes to disdayne, whair through my eyes there blyndnes dothe bewraye, which, whils they servd, they served but ay in vayne: my harte now knawes quhat sore perpetuell payne adoring yow with ?eale it hes susteande, and quhat conceates to honour yow did frame, and quhat trewe markes of doole it long reteand: now more advysde this muche by greif I gaynde, that, as I hope, so sall I see your face with weake encroaching age baith spoyld and staynde, as pailnes doithe your purpill cheikes deface, and see the roses faid which they have worne, and from my harte with theme to feill the thorne. XLVI. Full of desyre bot fraught agane with feare, I burne by hope, and by dispaire dois freise; with speide I merche, with als muche I reteire, and bakward the beholds with lotts wyffs eyes; I seme content, yet nothing can me pleise, and in this battell beares a naked harte, and cairles of my lyfe I scoure the sees of stormye thoughts and of tempesteous smart; baith of my weill and woe I pyle the cairt; I humblye crave, yet allwayes comes behind; I mereit muche, but rigour smores desert; I seik for grace, and dois displeasour fynde: thus do I see approache my fatal houers quhair loss and shame is myne and blame al yours. XLVII. Quhen that her eyes giues hope of better happ, and pittie in bellisas face appeirs, then to my playntes I do the passage stapp, and dois orpass my grones, my greifs, and teares; quhils thow, fair saule, incace thow len thy eares vnto the mornfull accents of my mone, hes revisht me above ten heu[n]lye spheres, then I conceate I sitt above Ioves throne; and quhen these hands, which schame the yvore bone, I softlye touche, though they not gripp agayne, I feill my former sorroues all ar gone, as no remembrance of my noyes remayne: with suche sueit thoughts love dois my thoughs possess, that hope groues more and I dispair the less. XLVIII. Schip brokken men whome stormye seas sore tosss protests with oaths not to adventur more, yet all there perrells, promeses, and losss they quyte forgett quhen they come to the schore: Euen so, fair dame, whils sadlye I deplore the schipwrak of my witts proceurd by yow, your lookes rekendleth love as of before, and dois reviue which I did disavowe; so all my former voues I disallowe, and buryeis in oblivions grave my grones; yea, I forgiue herefter euen as now my feares, my teares, my cares, my sobbs, and mones, in hope, gif I agane on roks be dreven, ?e will me thole to ancer in your heaven. XLIX. Sueit lovlye kisss and vncontrold disdaynes, sueit lovlye frosts, sueit kyndlye loving flams, sueit burning fyres, which suetar cold restraynes, eyes full of peace and eyes that deathe proclaymes, face full of bliss, which nocht bot rigour shames, strong rok of faythe and feble reide of love, harte soft with hope, harte that al happ disclaymes, myndes that with myldnes wyldnes dois approve, this humeur her, that humeur me doth move, this is her state, and that is myne agayne, now lowting lowe, now monting high above, so none of vs can tell quho feils more payne; bot this I knaw, shee smyles quhen I do dwyne, so all the dommage and the doole is myne. L. O faire whyte hand, who onlye ought to hold of cupids chariott the triumphant reanes, whils he with conquests chargd of young and old will all the warld and heavens did feil his traynes; O lyvlye snow, lovs sceptar that susteanes, from whome proceids bothe fyre and golden darte; quhyte silk, quhyte Milk, which spredeth in my vaynes, by heire, by touche, by taist, that kills my harte; whyte polisht yvore, wondar of gods arte, Faire obiec of the heavens eye and beames, Lovs pryde and pompe of his triumphant cairte, yeild grace to me the trophee of extremes, and panse the wonds of my vnceasant payne, for as yow hurt so can yow hail agayne. LI. Love sayes its tyme that I agane returne to wayle my wonted woes and sad lament, and to resume the flams by which I burne, and which hethe bothe my blood and bodye spent. thus wayes I feil his bow ay euer bent but intermissioun to perseue my harte, who never yet his rigour hethe relent, yea, in trewes to play a tratours parte: for whils that he dothe seme for to convert bellisas face from rigour vnto reuthe, and gentlye now and then to spair his darte, that hes him servd twelf Moones and months with treuthe, I feill him now agane prepaird the more to mak freshe wonds of a half heald sore. LII. Bellisa faire, as I am bound I byde: deathe me devyde er I from yow refraine; no proude disdayne of yours nor spytful pryde, quhilk love hathe tyde, dissunder sal in tuayne. suppose I payne in this my constant vayne, which is bot vayne, though it be constant kythd, yet I assyde layes all that ought restrayne me to remayne so daft of love denyed. ?ow sene and spyde my faithe lyk to your hyde, and hathe it tryed trewe gold by rigours stayne: it brings bot stayne to yow to have defyed the god, my guyde, who hathe afore yow tayne, and may agayne yow stay fra wandring wyde, and say with me, “as I am bound I byde.” LIII. Muse, yow fair dame, from whense doth flow this vayne quhilk dois incense me in your lasting fame? whils ?ow do dryve my thoughts to speachles payne, which, for your love, I to this age proclame, No Muses help, nor yet appollos flame reclered hathe the cludds of my conceate. but sence I vewed your beautye but al blame, verse flowes but art as skill comes alwayes late: your browe, your hair, your compast vaults maist fate, tua starns, a mouthe with perle and rubyeis dekt, whyte hands, which suld weire sceptars of estate, whyte breist, quhyte hyde, quhyte alabaster nek, grave paece, quik witt, and wisdome maist devyne, appollo ar to me and muses nyne. LIV. O of my barren muse the birthfull seed! o quik reviver of my deid conceates! o scharpe persewar of my slow retraits, In whose fair face bothe lyfe and deathe I reid! o thow my foe in love and freind in feed, that rayses vp my courage and abaites, that saves by hope, and by dispair defeats, that semes to help, and geveth no remeide! O chanell of my ioy, and well of woe! O tempests of my noyes, and calme of caire, who nather halds me stil nor letts me goe! o heavens bliss, and hell of all dispaire! o glore of earthe and pryde of euerye place dispachte my lyfe or ells do grant me grace! LV. My langour dothe by lingring gretar growe; my greiffs ar graven baithe in bronse and brasss; my harte first hurt now kendled lyes in lowe; my miserye her mercye dothe surpass; my bitter hope, no better then it was, whils as it is, sua must it ay remayne, which weathers wadther [?] lyke and groues as grasss; as I doe boyle in bayle and pyne in payne, bound in loves bands I liue, and fayne do fayne for to be fried quhair I am fingar fangd, exemd, exeimend baith of his trone and trayne: in vane conceate whils I am wringd and wrangd I thus wayes crye, “O Ioyles, ielous man, that feares to loss the lass I never wan!” LVI. In serving yow I see my losse insewe, and to my ruyne that I rin with speide; I see that deathe, with terrour to my vewe, dothe with her darte vnto my fall proceide; I see I must dispaire to find remeid, quhils pittie hathe no place nor plaints prevayle; I see yow cruel, cairles of my deide, and cairfullye your murder I conceale: yet thow, curst, blist engendrer of my bayle, extend thy grace at last and harte relent, perpend my woes in ballances of zeale, and trye my treuthe and my vnstaynd intent: iff they be light, downe wey thame with a kiss, the gayne wer great, and gever I wald bliss. LVII. Ten thousand tymes from syde to syde I turne, and restles rowe as on a edge of thorne; all thir cold nights I gant, I glow, and burne; I wishe for day, yet languish quhil the morne; and thinking all that quhyle I here a horne annuncing that aurora dois appeire to glad my harte by langour all forlorne, and closed darknes of my eyes to cleire, I mak thir verse, but light and beames perqueire, not knawing yet the sequell of the same, disturbd with youling hounds that hourlye beare, and kekling crawes that semes my paynes proclame, and aye crye off her quhose beutyes works my smart, reuthe in thy eyes and rigour in thy harte. LVIII. Loue for my loss is changde in fyres and wormes, which doith inflam my spreits and hert dois gnawe, and vowing treuthe all falseoode euen performes, pretending reuthe, yet rigour dois bot shawe: my forces ar bot frayle, yet gainst all lawe he armed me vnarmed dois invayde; he sees my teares, he heares the sighs I blawe, and maks my service thankleslye repayed. I see him now in ambushe closlye layd amangs the roses rid and lillyies quhyte; I see him now to mak my forces fayde be rubyeis which me burne and perles that byte; And thought I see this loss I can not shun, quhils naked now into the fyre I run. LIX. I burne by hope, I freise agayne by feare; I fredome searche, yet spoyles me of the same; I peace embrace, from rest I doe reteire; I am In hel, and yet the heavens I clayme; I see far off, yet vayles to eyes I frame; as I me yeild, so bakward I withdrawe; I her extoll quhome I agane doe blame, and puft with pryde I prostrat me more lawe; yea, dombe I crye, and smyling sadnes schawe; I walk with light, and taks a blynd for guyde; yea, not attentiue, I bothe heare and knawe; the more I crave, the more I am denyde: thus love me binds and drawes by double rope, and maks me fondlye perrish be my hope. LX. As that poure foolisch fliee, quhase custome is by flams to fyre her wings and lyfe to lose, dothe fondlye flie to her conceated blisss, and purches deathe in place of her repose, so in beholding thee, my fragrant rose, thy sweit aspect hethe quikned vp desyre, which of my ruiyne doth the cause disclose, and forceth me for to refanne my fyre; So that in this for quhilk we bothe aspyre, we equall doole and disadvantage prove; with lyke effects of our imagind hyre we lose our lyfe and onlye bot by love. disequall yet in this ar thow and I: thow quiklyee dees, I deing never die. LXI. This is the actioun I intend to move and pleye at beautyes barr but all appeale: whils your faire eyes wer summonds first of love, and then my lookes the lybells of lyke ?eale, I doe accuse yow that ?e mak me vayle, and restleslye dryve over my nights and dayes; by burdings of the greifs quhilk I conceale, quhair love dois grow, and lyfe, alas, decayes, my tymles, aged, silver haire bewrayes there tymles chainge by rigour and my smart; and sence my flams with coldnes thow repayes, contemming cairleslye all trewe deserte, ryve thow the charters of my fainting breathe, sen from thy skarlet lipps proceids my deat[he]. LXII. As one quhome trembling feaver hathe ortayne, by intermitted tymes bothe hote and cold, dothe faintlye on his right and left syde leane, and finds his bedd more harder then he wold, euen so in love suche passions I vnfould, now frost, now fyre, now waxing reade and paile; al night on left and right syde I have rold, and seaking ease, all ease, alas, doeth faile; and quhils that hee quhome thrist dois sore assayle, remembring drink, recressis mair his drouthe, so I remembring the rebreids my bayle, quho can not sucke these lipps nor kiss that mouthe: yet though our doole be lyke and our desyre, Les painfull feavers ar then lovs his fyre. LXIII. Vpon this firthe, as on the sees of love, my beaten bark, with waltring wawes tost sore, to the bright fyre her wandring course dothe move, imagining I see the on the schore: thy words, the Mapp and cairt is, O my glore, thy eyes, the ey attractiue calamite, thy winks, the tuinkling stars which I adore, the pointed compass ar thy proper feite, the rudder is my reason vndiscreit, the airs my greiffs, the reas my piteous plaint, the ancar doubt, the suits sowre sueit, the schip my half deade harte through mad Intent, the see my teares, my sighs the whirling wynde, which maks me seik the heaven I can not fynd. LXIV. This lark releiud by yow, greate soverane queene, refigurs not my paynes nor yet my plight, which in the foulers hand with feare hethe bene, conceating causes baith of deathe and flight: schee fredoome hes recoverd by your sight, fred of the cage whair shee suld bene enclosd, miracoulouslye hethe on your neck now light, and ioying lairgar lyfe hathe there reposd; Bot I, alas, no lark to deathe exposd, no Fouler cachting bot a Fouler caught, inthralled by the [whose] beautye hathe me glosd, and sereinlyke hes at my thraldome laught, can never fredome to my harte proceure, quho might to mercye euen wyld beastes alleure. LXV. Tuix heavenes and her whome onlye I adore I euerye wheare discerne resemblance greate: theme phebus bright and phebe faire decore, shee in her breist and hair is lyke perfyte; theme bloodie Mars and Mercure dois delyte, sueite speache doth her and harte severe maist grace; they Saturne Sad possess with venus quhyte, shee witts maist grace with faire and lovlye face; In theme great Iove dois thundar furthe a pace, in her ar lyke effects of calme and storme. quha then to see the heunlye Spheres wald prease, veue her who to the heavens is most conforme; And he agane who wold behold my faire, convert his eyes to heaven and sie her thaire. LXVI. Wurk as thow list my wrak, and frame thy face to reuthe, to yre, to rancour, and disdayne; my thoughts vnto suche wrongs gevs no more place then does searocks vnto the Occean Mayne; be as thow art and as thow wast remayne; not as I was I am, for I am frie, and sore ashaymed so long to serve in vayne, but any gayne by bontethe or by fee. I was a catiue slave to love and thee, and humblye on thy plesour did abyde, bot scorns the now as thow haste scoffed me, and maister of my self doith dant thy pryde: yea, lovles now I do my workes disclayme, which for thy prayse I spent and to my schame. LXVII. Quhat more can I performe or thow exspect then consecrat to the my lyfe and harte, and that sueit fredome which men maist affect into a slavishe thraldome to convert? quhat more can I, faire dame, to the imparte then houers, then oulks, then monthes and yeres to spend, devysing how thow may resist deaths darte be these my verse whiche for thy prayse I pend? I fraymd my witts thy vertewe to comend, I sought by gifts and service the to gayne, I sought by slights and treuthe thy yres to end, I sought thy love be my eternal payne; yet to thy lasting glorie and my shame, I gett no guerdon of the, cruell dame. LXVIII. Not for thy sake, o fair disdanfull dame, whome I weill knaw how euil thow thinks of me, I do my passions and thy prayse proclayme, who lenghts my lyfe that I may alwayes dee; not for thy sake, that thow suld here or see the melancolik accents of my mone, I vent my woes, and sings of love and thee, and to this age and future theme expone; Bot that al these with me may sobb and grone, who through trewe love hathe chaingd bothe hewe &amp; haire, and folishlye vnto there deaths hes gone, and not resents the horrours of dispaire, may now lament there loss, there shame, and smarte, in geving homage to a rebell harte. LXIX.MILITAT OMNIS AMANS. How can I be cald constant in my love sen in inconstancyie my dedes consists? I mount and fall; I baithe stand stil and move; I feare, I hope; I leave aff yet insists; my lauliness all proude disdayne resists; baithe glad and sadd, I frese and I do burne; and in despyte in patience more persists; content, displeasd, attones I smyle and murne; as I wald go, als sone I wald returne; my plaints sueit musik ar, my confort caire; I bakward stey with bitt, and fordword spurne; thus of inconstant constant am I maire: And since thow, love, suche contrairs dois agrie, Ioyne me to her and her agane to me. Affluit incautis insidisiosus amor. W. Fouler. LXX. Eternal lord, God of immortal glore, though I in love my self and sense have lost by vainlie vowing quhome now I do abhor, with sighs and teares causd baithe by flams &amp; frost, though, soverene prence, I have in playning most bewaild my panis bot not bewaild my sinn, and so maid sad in me thy holie ghost, yet drawe my saule from hell that thense doth rin. this, O Sueit lord, to grant I will begin, that I have blaikned beutyes lovd and servd, and hethe adord bot outward bark and skin, and earthlie things to heunlye hes preferd: yet let thy mercie the to mercie move, and off my mortal mak immortal love. LXXI.This is the last sonnet in the Drummond manuscript.

Lord in thy wonted kyndnes me embrace, that to this age I may these words procla[m]e: “as I In one god euer ay haith trust, so ar his promeis steadfast, trewe, and Iust.” W. Fouler. LXXII. It is thy plat and course, o Mightye Love, to trayne me to thy girns agane &amp; snaire, and mak my thoughts, fraught now with present cair, my former wonnted woes agane to prove. thow sunn that sees and shynes from heavens above did euer thow behald a face more fair, the wondar of this age, a phenix rare, quhose grace to honour her my hart dois move? And thow, fair dame, on quhome the heavens hes steld attanis all that which sondrie hes in part, Let me not in the entrie be expeld of this my offerd service and my hart: so sal the prayse be yours and paynes all myne, and with your beutye sal your bontye shyne. LXXIII. Bellisa pansiue satt, and in her hands, more whyte then snaw, did hald the holye booke, and reiding that which shee weill vnderstands devoltlye with her eyes did thairin looke; and quhils her heide was boued her brest shee strooke, and with a godlye and a gudlye ?eale pourd furth her sighs of vapours ful and smoke, and with such incence did her plantis revele. “O god,” sayd [?] I, “and [?] dois my day[m]e bewayle my sore afflicted and distressed state?” “O god,” sayd[?] I, “repents shee of her fayte, her wrathe, her rigours, and her m[u]rder [?] greate? no! no! for this I see and am asseurd, her godlines dois mak her mair indurd.” LXXIV. Quhils with more reuthfull and alluiring eyes thow wings my hope that I may yet aspyre, and dois prepair the tymber, colls, and treis, for to reviue my half exti[n]gisht fyre, so sone I feel the force of thy desyre tak full effect and fuller me enflame; yea, never Lunt more Lint nor poulders yre inkendled soner then ?ow me, my dame. bot seing the Vntouched [?] with the same, I twirle [?] a roll of love, and rubb eache part of your sueit corse for to enflame the same, quhilk sone was quensht by coldnes of thy hart: so nather booke [?] nor songs contentment brings, for paper flams not with saddnes sings. LXXV. RAPPORT. So hard a hart, so could, so frie then myne, no arrow, flame, nor cord, perst, brunt, nor band; bot captiue now I am through these assaults of thyne; sore hurt I am, flamd, chainde by feit and hand, more ferme then stone, more cold then frost or sand; frie and exemd fra force of lovs impyre, I feard no wond, no letts, nor bur[n]ing brand, by bow, by netts, by sparks of whote desyre; bot now by shott I am destroyed in yre, as never dart, nor fewell, chayne so sore, a hart more oppned, fastned, or did fyre; and yet save death I see no help therfor to staunche, quenshe, lousse, the bloode, the bleise, and knott, that binds, waists, rinis, which I to stey meanes not.</field>

Ps. 6.O Lord, rebuk me not in thyne anger, nather chastise me in thy wreath. What wight more wretched is than I who am so sore assayld, so pressed with the wardes of woe, that all my ioyes ar skaild? quhat wight more wretched is than I, outraged on al syds, and wounded be my conscience a farther wound abyds? The touch of my trespasses all hath pearcst me Through and through, Thy soft correcting hand is nou becommed more hard and rough; and nou at brink of that great deip and dungeon of dispair, my bodye with al euils oruhelmd and corsps inuolud in cair, my mynde in sorrous plundged so, and with al torments torne, dois reu The houer whairin it was so creat, framed, and borne. Quhat shal I do? quhat sal I say? or whether sal I goe? or quhat May I find in my self bot subiects for my woe, and causis of my suffering for brekking Thy command? who thairfor then sal succour me or help be helping hand? if to the heauen I cast my eyes, I see in heauens my Iudge; The sunn, The great Eye of the uorld, dois beare me deadlye grudge, The sunn, I say, which hath me seene so often to offend his maker great and also myne, to summon me dois tend, and semes to giue the uorld light, and bot his beames explaine, for to behold me whilst I thoale my iust deserued paine. The night which semes to couer al with her dark mantle blak, alas! quhat dois sche als portend bot for to scheu my wracke? for sooth sche semes to doubled hath her darknes double more in lothsome hatred of my sinnis in which I long did glore. It yrks The earth for to sustaine a createur so curst: Me Thinks I see her solid plaines a sunder for to burst; Me thinks I see alreddie sche hath opned vp the throate off her great gulf to suallou me and burie in her goate; me thinks my self into her self sche nou dois redamand, as hauing much abusd that mass of which I formed stand; Me thinks The nurishment which dois my bodye intertaine is only geuin me to prolong my lyffe in longar paine; Me thinks That death her self recails, and from me her astrayes, and semeth by her lothing me for to protract my dayes, lest sche suld seme to giue at least some senslesnes of greif, and lest this bodye miserable by death suld find releif. And as for men they ather be my foes and ennemeis strong, or ells such freinds as haue no might for to remeid my wrong. quhat sal I say? wheare sal I go? or whether sal I go bot Euen to The, eternal god, although I be thy foe? for quhat aduantage can I gett auay from The to run, whose presence present is alwheare, which I no wayes can schun? who can me hyde from him which sees these things which ar vnseene? what createur, althought it culd, my querrell dois maintene? yea, if it culd, what would ensewe bot thair ruine and myne, my fall thair loss, my death thair doole, and both our wraks in fyne? now since my greif and my disease none can remeid save the, to quhome then shuld I haue recourse, to whome then shuld I flie, bot vnto the, eternal god, more great then greatnes self? behold him than who hes him cast vpon this sandye schelf; behold him who is nothing les, onles his gretest yll be something which may giue the caus both lyfe and soule to kill. Creator great! thy creature behold disfigurat quyte: o louer man! behold him that contemnd the in despyte: perfectlye good behold him that conceaved is in sinn, borne in iniquitie, and long conteneued hes thairin: behold the timbar drye and trees now sett against the fyre. how can it then so hardye be to speik or the requyre? his miserie constranis him, lord, some remedie to seik; thy goodnes dois him boldnes giue that thus wayes he dar speik; thy favour, lord, off which the world hes such ane oppen proofe, dois oppen my mouth to crye to the, and call in my behoofe. Lord, in thy wreath reproue me not, nor in thyne yre correct, auert thairfor, o lord, thy rage for Iesus christs respect. o god, that hes so often sayd, the way not to be Iudge is for to Iudge our selfs, and haue to the our whole refuge, behold me, most vnhappy man, that dois in treuth confes before the angells, heaven, and earth, that sore I do transgres and hes transgrest against the, lord, yea, many thousand tymes, and, guyltie off thy precepts all, committed guyltie crymes. haue mercye vpon me, o lord; for I am weake: o lord, heale me; for my bonis ar vexed. yet what emboldeneth me, my god, thy mercyeis for to sew, bot euen thy pittie and thy grace and thy compassions trew, which so muche greatar ar, for that they to the worthles streache, abounding most whair sin surmounts deaths plagues for to impeache? I dust and asses am, o lord, yet suffer me suppose so bold in the, not in my self; my state I now disclose. O euerleving god, I learned euen in thyne house be the, and in my self by thy great grace which thow hes schawen to me, that thow a fathers angar hath, and als a Iudges yre: I worthy am, lord, of the last, yea, and of hellish fyre; I mereit it, lord, I confes, bot I beseache the turne the same from me, and with thy plagues which maks me now to murne. the other I will not refuse becaus it buildeth vp, for who be chaistisd those be loued, and drinks of ple cupp. now then, my god and gracious lord, correct bot not confound, smyte bot keip in the violence that in this blow is bound, an[d] in a word tak pittie, lord: for who hath neid of grace bot he that guyltie is, and dois so feare thyne angrye face? who craveth confort bot euen those who ar of confort voyd, or who dois physick bot the sicke who ar with sickenes noyd? Mysoule is also sore troubled: but, lord, hou long wilt thow delay? Bot yet againe who can or may raise vp the wreched wight, orwhelmed with the weght of sinne In his and al mens sight, so beaten by thy puissant hand, and crushed, bones and all, Disparing in his conscience, and in dispair to fall, bot thow, great god and glorious god, who by thyne onlye word giuis being to all that is or was, and through this wark is glord? confirme then that which remanis of thy great pouer In me, or rather wourk that work anew which is vndone by me. how long wilt thow, my gracious god, to thole me languish soe? how long sal I crye yet onhard and vnreliued of woe? how long sal I thy mercyeis waite or for thy grace attend? o lord, how long wilt thow delay my sorroues for to end? Lord, suffer that my dollour may this language lairglie vse, yet craving pardoun for my fault my boldnes to excuse. returne, o lord, delyuer my soul: saue me for thy mercyis saik. turne then, I say, o god, againe to me thy Ioyful face, which with one look the deid reviues, and death euen doith deface: lay furth these great compassions to heale my fainting soule, for only on thy grace I suit, my suit, lord, not controule. for in death thair is no remembrance of me: in the graue who sal prayse the? O god, thow knowest quhat great desyre I haue to be the meane and instrument of thy great glore, as dois to me pertaine, and to employ my voyce and lipps, my mouth, my hart, and toung, thy prayses, lord, to publish all the sonnes of men among. alas! then, lord, sal these my sinnis, thus sending me to death, be able to repress my course or stopp my purposd breath? for being dead and lying In dust my good intent wer crost, my purposs brokken off wer voyd and resolutioun lost, my memorie shuld the forgett, my toung suld speik no more off the, nor yet my mouth suld it force [?] to praise or speik thy glore; and to be short, this wrethced corss, this poore corss of grace denud, whairin suld it serve ather the or do to others good? Besydes this, lord, if I not die this ordinarye death, bot euen sal die so smitten with yre of thy consuming wreath, o god! my god! how can I then remember the that houer in which death shal her triumphe mak, and bring me in her pouer? how can I call vpon the, lord, so in my gretest neid, whils then the memorie of my sinne thy mercyies sal exceid? what shal become of me, o wrechte, who going to a Iudge aireddie hes condemned me, and sentence shawen with grudge? oh god! great god eternal! save me from this woe of woes, restrengh this lyfe within my corss that so forlorned goes, assuire my soule with suired sings, be wittnes in this cace that both thyne yre and anger is appaised by thy grace, that quhen that veglie death sal come and to me sal appeir, no messinger of terrour it nor post sal be off feare, bot rather to bring newes of Ioy and tiddance of trew grace, of lasting lyfe to be Inioyd within that heuinlye place. I fainted in my murning. And as thow hast had now ane Eye and straightlye markt my sinnis, which thow dois mak me throughlye feale, which al my corss owrinns, considder now my chainged mynde, mark, lord, the chainged man, which dois condemne which he approued and that to lyke began. I causd my bed euerye night to suimme, and water my couch with my teres. I haue long sleped in my ioyes, in plesour, and in rest, bot now my sleip disturbed is by sighing in my brest. heare, o yow nights! that hertofore wer wittnes of my noyes, and off tenthousand vaner thoughts and vaine Imagened Ioyes, and off the schamefull sequel of these vyld and curst conceates, which wittnes now these wailings all which all these ioyes awaits; and thow my secretar, o bed, a bed eearewhile of rest, bot ill employed all in sinn which sathan did suggest, be moystned with these fontanis tuoe as it but weill affears! fleit thow in surging wawes of woe, and swim thow with my teares! Myne eye is dimmed for despite, and sunke in bycaus of al my ennemyes. O [Sunne, the great light of the uorld! O Sunn! o Sunn! I say, whose brightnes I vnworthye am for to behold this day, my dimmed eyes, tuoe sinful pairts so iustlye plagued, alace, no more beholds the golden beames nor yet thy glancing face, they being soaked in my heade, and drawen drye by teares that they haue shed for my trespass which wittnes weill my feares; they be with yrksomnes, I say, and heavines quyte worne, the wittnesses which vexes me, and makst me most forlorne. bot quhat, sal I then peirish, lord? then is thair no more hope? am I without recoverye, or must I lose the scope and butt to which I did intend? sal so dispair possess my marred mynde sans hop of grace that faith may grow the les? No, no, my god, thow wilt not so: for this my plaint for sinne, whense cummis it, lord, or yet this trust to call thy name heirin? whense growes this hatred of my self, or this desyre to mend? whense cummes it that I in my soule my sinfull deids expend? It certes is thy grace, my god, from whense al grace dois grow: for whense cummis any good but from the or from the dois flow? o mightie maker of the heaven, how woundrowes be thy wayes, Incomprehenseble by witt, and so all wight asseyes! for can it be thyne yre, o god, that may me quyet make? or can it be my heavines that courage causs me tak? or can my death the causer be of this more Ioyfull lyfe? or can my warrs me peace proceur, or can ease come be stryfe? no, no, my god, that bennefeit no white of one proceids, nor is it any work of myne, nor cummis it be my deids. bot, lord, In wourking against him as much as in him lay, who had vndone and wrakt him self, thow shewest by this the way the self to be the self same god that al of nothing wrought, and out of darknes canst bring light, as thow hes euer brought. grace cummeth then from the to me my self from self to driue, that I may find my self and weill and both in the to liue. Away from me al ?e uorkers of iniquitie; for the lord hath heard the voy[c]e of my weping. yow then my foes who wened haue to cast me flat on ground, shal yow now dar your faces shaw or any more be found? And thow malicious satan vyld, the authour first of ill, quhat ganest thow to throw me low, or yet me seik to kill, save thairbie that my victorie and conquest much is more to be remarked and renouned, more notableye thairfor? for, maugre the, thow seest that god will triumphe ouer In the, and be my weaknes the orthroe, and force the for to flie. And thow my self, vnto my self my most and dangerous foe, yeild vnto god thy self againe, gainst him no further go; whome whilst as thow withstood with rage, and more did him resist, the more thow camest ner to death, and whils that least thow wist. And yow, o cursed miser man, whose trade is to do ill, and yow who hes these many yeres so sought my blood to spill, and yow who me perseued, I stand In fray of yow no more, nor do I feare yow al this houer Though feard I was afore. The lord hath hard my petition. The lord uill recaue my prayer. for the eternal which hes semed to cast me off but cair hes sene my teares, and hard my sighs, which perced hes the air; and he which semed to rander me into your cursed hands, through huimble prayers of my hart against yow fechting stands. and thairfor ye who ouerbold hes sought to wourk my shame, Al mine enimeiis sal be confunded and sore vexed: they sal be turned bak and put to schame suddenly. go, get yow hence, for now the lord your misheifs will proclame. as this I speik, me thinks I see yow euerye one forlorne, and leave your interpryse in shame with great reprochte and scorne, a chainge so much more wounderfull, a chainge more hard and rair, as it hes cumd beyond al hope when less thairof was cair. deo gloria.

There did these tuo wilde savag beastes ambitioun acquent thame selfs familiar and mak thame with me tame, So that I was euen at thair beck, so far forth thame to fallow into a sea al bottomles and in a schoare most schallow, wheare they endeuourd all thair best to mak me with thame duel, and all (quoth they) to bring to me the treu and blissed well; in steade whairof I was betrayed within dame pleasours hands, That harlot nice and strumped dere, and fettred in her bands, a harlot whome none vylder is, inticing euerye way al those which doe bot looke at her, and which is more, I say, Sche them bewitcheth in such sort, and with her cup dois peepe, that suddenly thair conscience becommeth lulled asleip; all Iudgment quicklye then is lost, our senses sensles all, As that we loue which is our woe and loth our weale. for quhat most foule is semeth fair, and quhat is hurtful most most healthful semeth, and which is most soure dois seme most sueit; yea, oftentymes our fading ioye and filthie pleasours vane dois bring vs thousand woes and schame and sorroues on vs vaine. oh blissed and most happy man which balkst this streight right way, and singlest the from persouns such which wourks but thy decay! but woe is me, yet haue I done more worser then al this: for going foorth of this desart and wildernes amiss, I entred am into a realme and to ane other land war pepilld with far worser folk, a folk of sinful band: for hithertoe I rather bene deceaved with such slight, which vanetie did cast befor my eyes and dimm thair sight; my errour not of nature came, not yet through wilful will, bot did of ignorance proceid, not of intent to ill; yet from Thencefurth insteade that I suld be my harme have learnd, and al my faults amended which with reason wer discerned, I gaue myself to do muche worse, and did my apply to couetousnes and deceat, to whoordome and envye, and Into euerye kynd of vyce, and did myself persuade this was the nerrest way to bliss, that me most blissed made. And quhen my conscience me sometymes did iustlye then reproue, I sought the meanes to vail my Sinn and cherish with self loue: I went about for to beleif that vyce was vertew then, and gredines bot husbandrie and thriftines of men; envie I nothing ells estemed bot euen a good desyre to haue of things about me such as others did requyre; deceat with me bot cuning was, and craft I counted skill, and drounkennes good fellouschip, and whoordomes not ill; but youthful toyes of young delyht I murder manhood thought, and pryd I counted cleinliness, and to be short I sought all vyces vnder vertew schade to couer and excuse. bot, wreched catiue man I am! I did me far abuse: for nothing in this sinful way nor in her end haue found bot that which far against these thoughts my hart with woe dois wound. So blissed is that persoun which not giues him self to vyce, nor fallowes such a uay of folk vpon so slyding yce, which to our bodye danger brings, and to our consc[i]enc[e] paine, destructioun to our better pairts, and [to] our soul againe. for wither such a custome doeth of ill doing thrust vs then? bot certenlye euen to this point That ue may god not ken, and lose all feling of his pouer, of conscience al remorse, So that we straine our selfs and soule to godles things with force; of ignorant we curst become, of cursed more pervers, and finaly despysing god with scorners we convers. oh most great god, and can it be that dust and ashes now should doate so in presumptioun, not only not to quaik at wairning of his conscience, and of it self awake, bot also for to set him self against the, potent lord, to schut his eare against the voce that al his sins record, to put out of his heed his eyes, that he might nor perceaue thy horreble great Iudgments all that his offences craue? oh most good god and patience self! Thou louer of al mankynd! So much as Thou didst not [him] spair bot him to death assynd who was Thy Sonne, Thy Equal to, yea, one self god with the, The Saviour of all Sinful men designed for to be. O patience self! how can it be, or can it come to pass That man suld so forget himself, who wethereth lyk the gras[s], as to reiect thy goodnes great, and al thy patience mock, which bearest with his rebell deids which dois thy wreath provok? yea, lord, alak! this is to trewe, and this we have done all, the worst, the least, from high to low, from gretest to the small. Yet, god of all treuth, Mercie, grace, reteir my stepps from those far crooked wayes wheirin alreddie I have gone: and since thow hes put in my hart of bless. a good desyre, Scheu me The readie good adress thairto I the requyre; and giue me will to fallow It, and it to pursue strengh[t], euen til I may attaine The same to thine great proof at leng[ht]. and though that this great difference not in this world is learnd, as be confusions of the same it can not be discerned, bot contrarie the ueked men seme surest to be planted, which knawen is to uell to those who prences courtes hes hanted, yet sal not this vaine sheu induir, bot thair Estait sal be thrauen doune, so sone as thy great justice they sal see to set disordered things in frame, which men discouereth soe when that great tryal day sal come, so dreadful, ful of Woe, whairon the weked sal not know to quhat place them to turne, bot al amaist sal houle for woe and al Through sorrou mur[ne], wherein the godlye being all regathered from al coastes, Thou sal do iustice of these wrongs which art the lord of hooste[s], Thou sal do iustice of thair deaths, Thair massac[r]es, and sak, and wipe their teares from al thair eis The wittnes of thair wrak. nou then, my soule, sithe that the franck frie bountye [of thy] God hath drauen the furth of these wayes, The paith, and trayning rod, and ualks of deip destructioun, and al vnto this scop to leade the in the onlye way of thy most blissed hop, tak heede that thow it not forsaik, Bot fallou on thy way and lywelye course; and suffer not The to be led astray, or be inticements more misleade, or more to be dismayed by any threatnings or yet feare which ar by some bewrayed; bot hold thow fast this maxime Then, and keip this in thyne hart, aganst al threats and flatteries which many hes subuert: Since god is God and uorlds Iudge, The righteous walking right to be al [?] blissed can not miss and happye in his sight; wheare on The other syd, al those who ueked ar and euil sal perish in their ueked sins, condemned to the deuil. deo honor.</field>

As Maye most worthy we doe call Of all the moneths in the yeare, AsMaye doth comforte creatures all And maks them looke with lyvelye cheare, AsMaye so brave the soyle adornes With bewtye that the heaven it scornes, Right so my love moste worthye is Of euerye lyffe that I haue seene; Hir countenance baiths ther hartes in blisse That dothe beholde hir cherfull eyne; And then hir bewtye &amp; hir grace, Wherso she comes, adornes the place. What pleasures Maye vnto vs brings, What frutes or flowers, what herbs or grasse, What treis or beistes, what fouls that sings, What lookes or wordes, what thoughtes that passe, What sighs for love, what songes or playe, What kyndes or mocions moves in Maye, As manye bewtyes in hir flowes, As manye vertues flowringe forthe, As manye graces in hir growes, As manye prayses is she worthe: Were all thinges tongus that spreides in Maye They could not half hir prayse displaye. And as she is the maie that maye Transforme to Maye my winter colde, So nowe in Maye some mayenge daye I hope she maye my cares vnfould, That I in prayse of hir maye saye, “Loe, all my ioyes began in Maye.” II.

The winter with his stormes is past; The so?er dothe repaire; From mountes the snow distills as fast, And lyvelye lookes the ayer. The skyes with Phebus beames are clad In clokes of golden hew; The siluer fountains dull &amp; sadd Ther course againe renewe. The trees with natures tapistryes Are hunge in budes &amp; leavs; The spyder for to catche the flyes hir webb &amp; nettes now weaves. Dame Flora, sommers seemlye Quene, hathe dect hir gardens fayre, And medows maskt in mantles grene, Wher beastes doe make repaire. The harte, the hynde, the Bucke, the doe, The swift recoursinge hayre, The Bagers, and the foxes goe As matched, payer by payre. The little foules amongst the leaves, In hales of hathorne tree, Doe buyld ther bowers in shaded greaues— A ioyfull sight to see. Nowe flockes they breake, &amp; couplinge springe Eche little one by his make; With sugred throates they sonettes singe, Eche for his swetings sake— The Robin, Wraine, &amp; whutinge quaill, The le?ett &amp; the Larke, The goldfinch &amp; the nightingall That sighs in shaddowes darke. The siluer haruest people dive In christall channells cleare, And euerye wight ther sprittes revyue As newe revyves the yeare. Nowe Zephir sweit dispercheth from The topps of buddinge trees, And honye from eche pleasant blome Nowe suckes the bussinge bees. “Saint Vallentyne! all haile to the!” These louers loud they shout; Nowe bagpypes blawes to warme on he These younkers rownde about. The wenches spoyle the motlaye grounde, And primrose garlandes plett, And hand in hand in ringes full rownde About the grene they Iett. And nowe I thincke I feile in me A newe desyre to move, And eche one saithe, for ought they see, The cause thereof is loue. Then if that love so shott his darte That none his bowe maye flee, I would to god I knewe that arte, Or might the manner see. Nowe that my love woulde me resaue, That would I first assaye, What other sportes these louers haue Then woulde I learne the waye. For loue, they saye, is Lorde of Ioye, Whence lyvelye bloode dothe springe; He liues beneath a lawlesse boye, Alofte a galliard kinge. My weides of woe, my mournfull mynde, And cares I caste asyde; To loue a seruant I me bynde; So Venus be my guyde. Finis. III. EPIGRAME. The fame is Ryffe of this, And oft affirmed trewe: A man that murdred is, And after laid to veiwe, If that the murthring wight approche that did the deid, The woundes burste open quight, Begining fresh to bleid; Contrarywyse dothe shewe, If that the murderer scape, The woundes doe keip ther hew, The man his deadlye shape. So farethe loue by me— Thexample is to plaine— For daye &amp; night I dee, Even murdred with disdaine; But if my love approche To me, by hap or grace, My woundes, as newe abroach, Begi?s to bleid apace; And otherwyse if I may noght hir presence haue, As murdred wight I lye, Euen redye for the graue. Finis. IV. ELIGYE. The sorye sighs, the sobbs, the sharpe assayes, The deadlye woes, the dangers &amp; dispayres, The sondrye sutes rewarded with delayes, The restles thoughtes that newe in me repaires, The cruell pangues, the tormentes &amp; the cares, That loue hathe lodgd within my dolefull breist, Might warne some wight all loue for to deteste. The Ioyfull mynde the daye soone ouer dryues, But slowlye slydes it with the wofull wight; My medecyne against my health so stryues That yet she sayeth my sicknes is but slight, Thoughe euerye hower a year is in my sight, And all tymes tymelesse tymes for my release, For with the tyme I feile my cares increase. Wherfore all hope in me dothe come behynde; My haples happ putes hope out of his place; Thoughe hope a whyle did feid my feruent mynde, And hopinge still I hopt for better grace, Hope to dispaire is tournd nowe, allace! his hap is hard in haste that dothe pursue, And spendes the worste in love that is most trewe. For if I absent be a daye or twaine, Thoughe she be neuer absent from my harte, My sute is even as newe to dresse againe As when hir bewtye caused firste my smarte. For looke, howe well at ease we can departe, I fynde hir always come of womans kynde; Thus of my woes no perfect end I finde. If faithfull seruice or a constant harte, A steidfast thought, &amp; meaninge always trew, Might purchace hope of guerdon for his parte, I ame assurd the same to me were due: For sooner shall the worlde be formd anewe, The frost be fyre, the day no more giue light, Eare I will falce one worde I hir behight. Finis. V. EPIGRAME. I sicknes took me late agoe That greveth me at euery Ioynt; No part of me is voyde of woe, But yet my harte is worst in poynt. I asked at a skilfull man If he could tell my greife aboue: He said: “my frind for soothe I can; Thou arte with chylde of feruent loue; And since thou haste no better chance, God send the good deliuerance.” Finis. VI. EPIGRAME. If Argus eys, Briarius handes, or Stentors voyce I had, To looke at lardge, To write at will, to showte lyke fyfttye madd, my sight would faile, my fist would tyre, my voyce wax dull &amp; horce, Ere I could spye, or yet could pen, or sound your bewtyes force. Finis. VII. [My dolefull harte, the tombe of deadly care.] My dolefull harte, the tombe of deadly care, My wearye ghost, that flickereth to &amp; fro, My bailfull breste, the de? of darke dispaire, Complaintes do followe me whersoe I goe, And I am right the register of rewe— Lo, what it is to love &amp; to be trewe! Wher are become those Ioyfull dayes &amp; hours When euerye wishe so well to me applyed? Howe fynde I love &amp; fortune on me lowres That did the bridle of my fancye guyde? I feele thy sworde (O sorrowe) throw me slyde; My blood doth faile; my mynde, opprest with paine, dothe curse eche cause that dothe my life sustaine. Those sugred wordes, thaucthors of my smarte, Those golden hayres that first my fredome lent, Those streaminge lightes that heald &amp; hurtes my hart, Those lyvely looks that from my self me rent, That heavenly face, &amp; all should me content Is fled, (alace!) and plaintes &amp; endlesse smarte accompanyes my guiltlesse martyred harte. A stormy Cloude eclipsed hathe the soone Whose beames did light my harte at euerye vayne; My barke that earst in wished baye did wonne Is broken on the rocke of falce disdaine; The floodes of woe wherin my breist I baine, The wavinge sighs, the teares of Inward stryffe, Hathe drownde the hope that ancord earst my lyffe. O who shall calme this tempest of my greife, Or who shall drye these seas of sorrows deipe? O deathe, (alas!), the troubled hartes releiffe, Be thou my Bote! O rocke my soule a sleipe! That sweite desyre that earst my lyffe did keipe Throughe newe desyre to bitter plaintes is brought, And all my thoughtes are turned into nought. O yee myne eyes, the herauldes of my hart, Why looke ye so, or ells why were ye blynde? O loue, when first thou peirst me with thy darte, Would god to death that charge had bene assigned! Woe to ech wight that to my will inclynd! But when my tongue did first my cares out caste, Would god my formost wounde had bene my laste! Finis. VIII. EPIGRAME. If that the Marques of Saluce Were liuinge in these dayes With Grisild, who for pacience once Did winn so great a prayse, This Marquess might a meter match Conforme to his degree, A grauer Grisild get then his, More pacient by suche three. No storme of Fortune may hir sturr, Nor worldly chaunce hir scarr: Yet say I not a man should prove A woman ouer farr. Finis. IX. ELIGYE. Now find I well what fevers followe love To them thats secrett, trew, &amp; pacient aye. The secrett thoughtes that secretlye I prove, And secretlye pursues me night &amp; daye, The passions that my pacience dothe assay, my truthe tormented with that feruent fyre wherwith your bewty wastes my hart awaye, might haste some harte of longsome loue to tyre. But hope dothe so my constant spreit inspyre, That in my care me thinckes she always sayes: “Thou haste so highly placd thy hartes desyre Thou cannot faile rewarde &amp; lastinge prays.” Yet say I not my truth deserues rewarde; I merit nought, the lesser can I craue. But if your bewtye list for to regarde The wight whose harte no hart but yours may haue, That were the wished wealth I would receaue. But if disdaine shall dryve me in dispaire, And bringe my corps with sorrow to the grave, Yours is the falte, &amp; deathe shall end my caire. But lo! when I beholde the bewtyes rare That God &amp; nature doth in you compounde, I saye of force some pittye must be ther, Wher all suche heavenly graces doe abound. Since first your bewty thralde my youthfull mynde, And forst my thoughtes vnto your thoughtes to bowe, To worke your will my will was ay inclynde, And wills no will saue that ye will allowe. What vayles myne eyes if they beholde not you? What serues my harte but service you to make? Vnto your sweit regardes my thoughtes I vowe; No sighs I sighe but onlye for your sake; Nought but your presence may my sorrows slake; Nought but your absence causeth me to mone. Of my desyres ye haue the fortresse take; I ame not myne if not for you alone. But O! who nowe saue I hathe cause to plaine? Who may but I nowe curse the destnyes three? O crewell absence! aucthor of my paine! Alas! I haue no deadlye foe but the. I seeke hir presence forst the same to flye, Whose absence presentes me a worlde of care; But be I absent, present, faste, or free, My harte is hirs in hope or in dispaire. The sory sighs lets not my tongue declare The sadd adews my soule to you would send; Yet to your bewtyes, grace, &amp; vertues rare, Ten thousand tymes my harte I recomend. Finis. X. [If tyme might cause me tyre.] If tyme might cause me tyre, Or reason wreste my will, Or if my hote desyre Might coole throughe carefull skill, Then would these woes distill Out of my troubled breist, And loue with pleasant ill No more should me molest. But since my will dothe reste In others wills then myne, My will is well addrest To serue that Sainct devyne. And since my will dothe will to followe my desyre, Let tyme be tyming still, No tyme shall me retyre Till tyme that I aspyre Vnto my hoped gaine; That tyme sall paye the hyre Of all my passed paine. For who will not sustaine A little tyme of toyle, he neuer shall obtaine In love the pleasant spoyle. If solace make me singe, Or cares doe cause me crye, Or if dispayre me stinge, Or hope me hoyse on hye, If hote desyre me frye, Or coold releive my smarte, With bothe content am I, And pleased in eche part. No tyme shall change my harte; My will is in your powers; What euer me astarte, my harte is onely yours. Finis. XI. [Thoughe tyme &amp; absence worketh wonders strange.] Thoughe tyme &amp; absence worketh wonders strange, And ‘out of sight forgott’ to often trewe, Thoughe frowarde Fortune sowethe cause of change, And sondry sightes engendreth fancyes new, Yet otherwyse my steidfast mynde shall shew: For one alone with me is in eche parte, And she alone contentes my constant harte. If I with bewtye seik my mynde to ease, Whom should I wish but she that is my choyse? If comly grace &amp; wisdome may me please, Who ought but she to haue the vulgar voyce? And as I iustlye cause haue to reioyce That she in vertue farr exceides the reste, So shall my truthe to hir surmownt the best. And as my harte is wholly to hir bent, So hope assures me happy happ for hyre, That when that tyme &amp; Fortune shall assent, My chance shall present me my hartes desyre. Thoughe tyme against me semes for to conspyre, And crewell absence threates me with disdaine, Yet sweit remembrance comfortes me againe. Finis. XII. BALLAD. Powre out my plaintes, o pyned sprites, And lett my langour come to light, Syne all is noght fyne gold that gleites, Nor Iewells best that shyne most bright; Now lett my hevy harmes be hard, That for my truthe is my rewarde. Show him that laughs to se my smarte but one of all my thousand woes, And lett the rest torment my harte, as suche as thought cannot disclose; And showe him, if he right regarde, My truth deserues some more rewarde. Then aske him, if ye may haue place, wher be those Othes with teares besprent, Those sobbs, those sighs, that feyned grace, That hart that euer falshood ment; And saye he shall miscompt a carde That truthe with treason would rewarde. Well may we see the owtwarde shape, But hard it is to iudge the harte; The mouse by guyle is tane in trap, Sweit baites makes foules &amp; fishes smarte; So I, alas! through fained fared Am lyke to reap the lyke rewarde. But if to longe ye waile to late, he may perchance showe more disdaine; For wher that loue tournes once in hate No pacience sure dothe ther remayne; But from him thoughe ye be debard, Yet say my truthe deserues rewarde. Finis. XIII. SONET. Against the streame to stryve it is but vayne, More follye were to fight against the fyre, And what winns he in loue that takes no payne? God wote he hathe but hevye hap for hyre. Eche thing hathe tyme, then saith my hartes desyre; My hart not myne, my harte is from me gone Vnto that hart first set my harte on fyre; Regardlesse nowe of all my plaintes &amp; mone, None nowe companions me but cares alone; Suche is the guerdon loue his seruantes sendes. Ahe faithe, good hope, take courage, man, anone, Yet Fortune may for all this make amendes: As first hir bewtye tooke from the thy harte, May not hir bowntye heale againe thy smarte? XIV. SONETT.

O loue who leidethe at thy will The hartes of humanis good &amp; ill, Whose puissance Plutoes raigne dothe reach, And to the cristall skyes doe streach, No power ther is that may resist The violence of thy darte! No highe nor lowe, but when thou list Thou makst them feile the smarte. To the these louers doe complaine, To the they showe ther ioye &amp; paine, To the ther solempne vowes they swere, conformd with manye a sighe &amp; teare; Thou frames ther gestures, countenance, speach, And lendes them wit &amp; grace, Attyres them trim, &amp; to ther leache Thou leides them in thy lace. At the then would I aske the cause Why last not these thy lustye lawes; The pleasour neuer perfitt was That dothe conclude with ‘Ohe! Alas!’; And oft tis sene that all thy Ioyes Thy seruantes doe posesse Convertes in passions &amp; annoys, In dollours &amp; distresse. I heare them curse thy courte &amp; the, Ther Fortune &amp; the destinies three, disdaines themselues the daye &amp; hower That first the fortund in thy power; The[y] flye, the[y] presse, theye hate the light, All mirthe augmentes ther woe, They feid on teares, they waik the night, Ther harmes haue neuer ho. Art thou the causer of this change? Or is it men of manners strange? Or do these ladies sowe the same? For they against the most exclame. I heare them say that faithe &amp; trothe In loue is ane exyle, And louers now no pleasures haue But louers to beguyle. If Loue be good, then would I aske Why settes thou vs so harde a taske; If thou be still, what is the cause That we obay thy fickles lawes? Vnhappie is the wight to loue his harte dothe wholl derect, For to his truthe thend shall prove That loue hathe no respect. Ye that haue loued, or louers be, Or myndes to loue, take this of me; And Ladies, ye that haue your hartes All francke &amp; free from Cupids dartes, Since loue is falce &amp; full of care, As euerye daye ye see, I counsell you, sweit Ladies faire, Trust none in loue but me.

What then should stay my tonge To vtter out my smarte, That hathe throughe loyall loue to longe Consumed a constant hart? But feare to'ffend Dothe still attend, Allas! And drownes in dreid my hote desyre: Yet hope dothe tell All shall come well to passe. Thus fainte I twixt the floodes &amp; fyre. But then againe, when I throughe hap behold Hir heavenly hewe that hath my hart controlde, Hir bewty &amp; hir grace, And hir celestiall face, Hir glisteringe crisped haire, Lyke Phebus in his chaire, Hir eyes the starrs that always light My hevye harte bothe daye &amp; night, hir lipps lyke buddes of roses newe, hir vaines lyke Indian Saphers blewe, And euery thinge so well, That all thinges dothe exell, Then to my self I tell, Some pittye heare muste dwell.

The troiayne prince that spoyld the flower of grece, Nor yet the duke that wan the golden fleice, No, nor that famous knight That Minose daughters bright Did free from all a?oye Might me compare in ioye. As Troyolus then I should be trewe, A Piramus myne end shall shewe, my steidfast part should then be knowne, howe I ame yours or not myne owne.

But yett they saye hope helps his frindes at neid, And courage comfortes hartes besett with care; We see them want that will not see them bleid. So, hevye harte, expell from the thy dreid, For hope shall helpe thy hevye hartes desyre; They neuer wa? that neuer hopt to speid; Who leavs good hope, good hope of him will tyre: For when our myndes are thrust with thousand dartes, Then, then it is, that hope helps hevy hartes.

Staye heare your lookes, then saide I to myne eyes, Rest hear my thoghtes, rest heare my highe desyres, For rarer sight is no wher vnder skyes, And of the reste my sprite so me inspyres: All is devyne, so nought my harte requyres But ay to serue that sainct whyll that I sterve, Who gaue that ge? to me which beates the fyres, That holdes my lyffe thoughe nought I can deserue.

When I would showe one of the woes Of many a thousand that I haue, The sighs &amp; sobbs my spreit so close That no way can I mercye crave; then leavs the blood my vaynes, the teares downe raynes, In feruent fyre I fleit, in snowe I swelt with sweit; The thinge that dothe me greve should me releive; dispairinge of all rewth I murder vp my truthe. Suche is my chance, suche is my lyffe, So loue rewardes his seruantes trewe; He bringes me with my self at stryfe, And for anothers peace to sewe; My hope dothe me deceaue, no hap I haue. What fury deip in hell can halfe these tormentes tell? A hart of hardest stone would seme to mone to see me in suche woes as thoght cannot disclose.

Farr in that ysle which the ocyan old Imbracethe lyke a wall, Which thanciantes named thother worlde, Nowe Brittaine we it call— Of which the middowes partes bespreides The hardye Inglish knight, The Northern boundes is bordred by The warlyke Scottish wight— Wher rears the dreadfull mownt so styld Of olde, who on his breast The broughe of Sterlinge beares, and high The Castell on his creaste, When Ianus tooke his Inn at signe Of Capricornus colde, In hope that thou, O Phebus great, Thy Ryottes ther should holde, Lo! in this ysle, this tyme, &amp; place, As ther my Ladye slept, Into hir harmlesse head the godd Morpheus closelye crepte, Dispersinge deip his dreames which showe Hir sleipinge sences sought, And lyke as dyuerse humours stird So dyuerse was hir thought. And first she dreames of hills &amp; dailes, And nowe in waylesse woodes She wenes she wanders wylde, &amp; treades In streames of furious floodes, Till on a pathe that ditches deipe, Which walls vpp flancketh thin, With water vglye blacke that beastes Full monstrous wallowe in, Agast, she thinckes she go'the, wher feare asaltinge on hir sett A swarme of serpentes that almoste Into the trenche hir bett. Three tymes they on sett made &amp; thryse repulst; they semed to fight By might vnknowne, till at the last Amid the mote they light. With this she thinkes she mendes hir pace, As dothe the chased hayre Eschapte the greyhoundes Iawes, and skipps And madlethe heare &amp; ther; As mynde of feare hir moues nowe faste, Nowe slowe, with pantinge breith, Beleivinge at hir backe hir foe pursewinge thristes hir deathe, So stryues this slombringe soule affrayde That perrills seikes to shun. But oft who dreadethe dangers most In dangers soonest ronne; As hapened hir who thought hir selfe drawn from all danger deipe, And ticklinge Ioye began about hir quakinge harte to creipe. Behould a dreadfull beast she thought She sawe of portlye state, Who, capteu of his owne accorde, stood pe?ed in a grave; Who, as he sawe my ladye, to hir lept with gastlye pawe, As he dovoure hir should, or all In peices would hir drawe. But veiwinge well hir highe regarde And steidfaste countenance graue, It seemd a soddaine feare him shooke: For backe with that he gaue, Lyke one who at a soddaine meittes his better in the streit, And quicklye giues the waye &amp; with Lowe curtesye dothe him greit; Or lyke the hownd rebukt before his lord dothe humblie lye, So fell this lordlye beast, &amp; semd hir mercye for to crye. With this my Ladyes dreame &amp; my Request at once tooke end. And thervppon Hiperions sonne This ansser forthe did send. Quod he: “somtyme the evidence Of these thinges visions be, But thryse as oft of none effect And frustrate ye them see. Of cogitacions of the daye Some say they haue ther ground, But of complexions moste they ryse, When humours highe abownde. To dreame of floodes &amp; swellinge seas And drowninge in the deipe, The persons that are flematyke oft metethe in ther sleip; The malencholique dreames of gahostes, Of bulls &amp; lyons wood, The Colloricke of stryffe, of fyre, Of weapons, &amp; of blood That downe the Mare his breist doth beare, The rudye Sanguyne vaynes. Thus sondry ways they ryse; But this Thy Ladyes vission meanes. The Narrowe passage that she past Foreshowes this combrous vaile So hard to trace; the Serpentes flee That did hir spritt assayle And almoste bett hir downe, that is, The tongus of wicked wightes That seikes hir deip decaye, but farr It shall surpasse ther mightes: For lyke as in the vglye pond She thoght she saw them blowne, So they ther false desertes &amp; slightes In Leathy shalbe throwne. The galliard beist in wilfull warde That semed for to remayne, Some youthe it is that lawlesse loue Hathe fettered in his chayne, Who rauisht with hir lyvely youthe, Hir bewtye, &amp; hir grace, Beleyved at first she linckt hir mynde Vnto his lassyve lace; But pondringe well hir stately race, Hir witt, &amp; manners grave, he sees that loue &amp; bewtye made Throughe luste his hart to rave; So nowe with tyme he hopes to win Which haste drewe in extremes. Iudge thou the rest: so fare the wele! Thou vexest me with dreames.” Finis. XXVII. ELEGYE. What greater pleasure would ye wish to haue Then fynde all thinges conforme to your desyre? But what more greife maye any wight receave Then lack the thinge his hart dothe moste requyre? Suche is my chancè, suche is my haples hyre, Since first of loue I felt the hopinge dread: Hope bides me hope when moste I seme to tyre, But colde dispayre, faithe, I shall neuer speid; I spye the right, and yet the wronge I frame; I beit the fyre, and burne me in the flame. Those sugred sighs that sinckethe to my hart, The sweit regardes of those celestiall eyes, Thalluringe speache that lendes me ioye &amp; smart, Me thinckes a meaner hope dothe me devyse; But yet so slowlye dothe this hope aryse, That black dispayre I maye it better name: For nother grantes I gett nor flatt denyes, But as betwixt the furious floodes &amp; flame I frye in hope, and drownes in dreid agayne; Desyre me burnes, yet freise I throughe disdayne. Goe ye, my sighes, dissolue those frosen Ise That rewthe nor pittye neuer could relent! Goe, plead my peace! I yelde to hir the pryce, And peace must fall when all hir warrs are spent. The pleasant peace that partyes dothe content More worthy is then conquest gott with stryffe. What helps the succour that to late is sent? Shorte deathe is better then a lothed lyffe; A hatefull lyffe engendrethe but dispayre; Sweit is the deathe that makes an end of care. Finis. XXVIII. [O well of witt, Of vertues head &amp; springe.] O well of witt, Of vertues head &amp; springe, With pardon be it spoke, of others moe, Moste perfitt, faire, &amp; good in euerye thinge, If euer yett ther was a woman soe. XXIX. ELEGYE. The tormentes strange, the grevous care So longe that burnt my breist In servinge of those butyes rare That first my hart posest, dothe not so muche my minde moleste with passions night &amp; daye, As absence when I seme at rest dothe eat my hart awaye. I want, &amp; yet I haue at will The cropp of my desyre; I haue that [may] my mynde fulfill Yet lackes that I requyre. O absence, quensher of the fyre That should my lyffe sustayne, By the I feile my ioyes expyre, By the I swelt in payne! Sore might thou sighe, o prince of Troy, When Creseyd the beguyld; Great was the Thebans knightes annoy When Thesius him exyled; But trible is this furye wylde That breides my hartes dispayre; I feare my fortune so vnmylde That death shall end my care. But woe is me that suche dispayres Should harbour in my harte, Since she for whom I feile these cares Is partner of my smart, And that I knowe hir constant part, That rather wishethe deathe Ere from hir promise she astart So longe as lastethe breathe. When absence dothe depart vs two Whose hartes are knitt in one, Me thinckes I feile hir secrett woe And all hir dreyry mone, And howe she sighinge saythe alone: “Ah! when shall I him see Who with my hart from me is gone, And left his harte with me? What is this lyffe but deathe to me If he be not in sight? Wher he is not my light should be, What is my daye but night? And as he is to me the wight Whose truthe surbraues the best, So shall I be the rocke aright Wher his trewe hart shall reste. Then, then, me thinckes, eche christall flood That tricklethe downe hir face Are at my hart lyke springes of blood, Newe persed in eche place. Eche sighe she sighs dothe quyte arace The harte out of my breist; Of sorrowes all I am the case, Of cares I am the chist. Yet is it not suche Ielous fears As com?n louers proue, Suche inward sighs suche outward teares As dayly followe love: The fury fearce that dothe me move, And downe my ioyes dothe caste, Is that the hope wheron I houe Will worke my Wracke at laste. And dreadinge thus the haples end Wherto our truths shall tourne, Dispayre dothe so my mynde offend That nought I can but mourne. Yet shall my hart with her so iorne In ioye or endlesse payne; But fortune fawne or at me spurne, Hirs will I still remayne. Finis. XXX. THE LASTE EPISTLE OF CRESEYD TO TROYALUS. Healthe, healthe to worthy troylus dothe His sometyme Cresyed send, If so she may whose lothed lyfe and lynes at ones must end. My wish vnseene was but to see The ones before my deathe, Which sight vnawares yet longe desyred Dothe stopp my vitall breathe: For destinies hathe me well assured My rewfull race is ronne, And Atropos with sythe in hande Is redye to vndone The fatall threid that Lashesses and Clotho once did Twyne, And hightes to haste my welcome deathe And longe desyred fyne. The cruell goddes to Creaseyda Vnfrindlye foes have beyne, That would to god some sauage beaste had me devoured cleane. When I of Troye was calld a chylde, And Phrigia soyle I sawe, Would [that] the earthe my little lymms Into hir wombe had drawe. Then should no poet haue the cause Faire Creyseydes treuthe to blame, nor after this with ladyes falce Remember Creseydes name; Ne yet no mann his fickle dame With Creseyd should vpbraid, Nor by examples bringe me in Howe Troyolus was betrayde. But would to god that Hecuba Had Priamus will fulfilld, And Paris as the Prophetts had Vnlucky ladd had killd; Or ells that he with Oenon yet Had taried still in Ide, And lyke a Sheperd fed his flocke by old Flamanders syde, And not for Priams sonne beyne know, nor Hectors brother namde. But O! the fates, the froward fates, hath thus his fortune framde That he the Swellinge seas should sayle, And Menelaus wyfe By rape should bringe, &amp; breid tweene Greekes And Troians mortall stryfe; Which in thend, as godes forbidd, Should tourne in flashye flame The princely pallace, Illion braue, Of moste renowme &amp; fame. O! rather wish I that the songe Of sousinge seas had drencht The leiches twayne, &amp; all the fyre Of loue by water quencht. Then should no greater Eageon sandes With shearing shipp haue sought, Mo thousande barged to thy shore, O Troya towne, haue brought; Then should my father Calcas not His natyve soyle haue fledd, When he to Tenidos was sent To seeke Appolloes neid; And then my haples husband had Not stand in deadly feilde, In sight amongst the furious Greekes All armed vnder sheilde; Then should myne honour haue beyne kept, Myne honestye vnfoulde. But Troyalus thou didst that defend As well as thester colde: For thou most trewe, most pacient was, Moste secret to thy loue, That euer ladye had ere this Or after this may proove; For .3. yeares space no lyffe but one, One loue that did espye. But why doe I thus wish &amp; woulde? I waste but tyme therby; All thinges that womans prayse should bringe In me is quyte defyled, That ought a worthy ladye haue A Grekisk kinge hathe spoylde; That shrouded is the shyninge light As night dothe blisfull daye. So curse I may the hatefull hower, Yea, well it curse I maye, That Anthono by chance of warr And force of greekes was take, For whom they me &amp; Thoas sende A full exchange to make. Was ther no other pledge, allas! Or was it me they seike? Why might not for a Troiayne duke Suffise a kinge, a Greik? Nay, mans provision was it not: It was the deadlye doome The fates ay from my birthe did threat Vppon my head should come. Than out on all these dreyry dames That destenyes dothe dispyse! And out on Fortune, fy on hope, The weauer of my woes! And now you angry nimphes whose plagues I feile vppon me ryffe, Your hate from hence can harme me nought, Except ye lengthe me lyfe. But, O my Troylus, if I darr Vsurpe this phrase aright, Howe could thy knightly harte consent, Or eyes abyde the sight, To see me vnder Diomedes guarde From Troy to Greikes so stray? Why slewest thou not thy mortall foe, And fled with me awaye? No, thou extemed myne honour soe Myne honestye to blott; Thou was affrayde, or ells thou shouldst Haue done it well, I wote. For thou no sooner tooke thy loue Of me, nor from me went, When Diomede with his sleated lipps Hathe faste my bridle hent. And then he sharpes his subtill will, And faste his brayne he fyles, And tipps his tongue with Rethoricks sweit, Bewitchinge me with wyles, And layethe me forthe his loue alonge, he no persuasion spares. Sometymes he Piteous tears dothe shedd, Some tyme as madd he stayres; Then dothe he bragg of Parentes stout, And in these eares of myne He ringes me out his royall race, And tells his stately lyne. Of Meliagers force he boastes, And howe the Bore he smightes, And howe his father Tedeus slewe Well armed fiftye knightes. Then dothe he promise Golden hills, Nowe hight me giftes full large, Forthwith he swears to make me Quene of Callidon &amp; Arge. But looke, even as the whiskinge wyndes Of Borias blasting boulde Amid the playne &amp; champion feildes May take no staye or holde, His talke so one eare fills &amp; out At t'other streight dothe goe: For then I was to Troyalus vowed, I swore to loue no moe. And thus he prates me on the waye, Till of the Grekish hoste We had a sight: he seinge then His mynde in vayne was loste, Did hartely pray &amp; me intreat, As humblie as he can, T'accept him as my seruant. Lo! What should I doe? as then I tooke him, so his painted wordes So muche did me abuse. But Troyalus, O moste worthy knight! Of the I craue excuse. Too hastye thou may thinke I was, I might haue yet delayed. Allas! to hastye may I saye— What travells longe thou made And Pandarus, eare ye could bringe The half of this to passe! His cursinges weighe me downe to hell, I feile ther payse, allas! Nowe, nowe my witt, wher be your help Some apte excuse to make? All wemen can devyse at will, Yet myne, allas! are slacke. But what excuse may me availe? My consience is attaint; For shame I feile my blood to faile, My dyenge ly?es are faynte. And nowe amidd the campe of Greekes We came, &amp; as we paste, Myne aged father, glad to se me, ledd me in as faste. Thatredes wreakfull brethern bothe Doe muche my bewtye prayse, The Lordes of Greece me welcomes bring, The soldiers on me gaze. Assoone as Phœbus on the moone From coutche did clymbe the skyes, Sir Diomede to the Tent Ilay With spedy pace him plyes; And faste he prayes, desyres, intreates Me him some signe to plight, Wherby he might be knowne my man, My seruant, or my knight. And kyndenes dothe he on me threape, As all were his at firste, But yet he frustrate was as then, Althoughe his harte should burste. But then my father tolde me that I must still ther soiourne, And me assurd I neuer shoulde To Troye againe retourne. Then caste I in my troubled mynde That Troyalus I had lorne, Who sorrowed then but Cresyda As ta fountaine he should tourne; No consolacion could I fynde. And then considderinge well Howe I a woman was alone, And dayly fortunes fell, What happs might chance me I ne knewe, I studyed this full longe; My father olde, Sir Troyalus loste, Then must I beare eche wronge. Nowe this, nowe that, I ryfle vpp Within my buissy brayne; Whyles will I with my father staye, Whyles steale to Troye againe. A sevenight thus I liued—huge fight was dayly still without, Stronge garde within—eche thinge presentes Vnto my harte a doubte. I pondringe thus, thou sent the Greik, Sir Diomeid, to his tent, With woundes profounde &amp; lardge which thou In Irefull rage him lent; To whom I came not myndinge evill, But frindely him to veiwe, And tooke my leave, lest he anon Did fresh his mater shewe, And me besought in humble wyse To rewe vppon his smarte. I, reckless wight, to soone, allas! Did hight him then my harte. Thou demed full lyte of all this fare, Thou thoght I was none suche, Till that on Diomeds cote of armes Thou spyed the little bruche. For after that full oft thou wouldste With Creseyd him vprayde, And for my sake, as was me tolde, Thou haste him sore outrayde; With thawked armes &amp; helme to dasht, With speare full sharpe Igrounde, Scarce curable thou pearst his fleshe With many a grevous wounde. Why on this traytour stay I thus? The goddes me on him wreake. Let fate worke on: lyfe leaves my limms, Even scarcely may I speake. He falsed hathe his faithe to me, And light lied me, allas! Of force the courte I left, &amp; to My fathers house did passe. The crewell godes not yet content With me to make accordd, My luringe face they leaper made, To se me men abhord. To hospitall by night I stole My self from sight to saue, Wher me was giuen a clappinge dishe My wretched cromms to crave, As thou me foundst, when as thou caste Thy golde into my lapp. Wouldst thou, O Troyalus, thought ther should haue chanst me suche mishapp? Ye famous painters wonted were To drawe with coulers pure The forme of thinge, with dainty hande, For euermore endure; And ye ingrauers, purposely, Suche artes as erste were paste, Did beate in massy marble stronge Eternally to laste; But loue in mowld of memory Imprintes in perfitt harte The loued, so that deathe it self Can noght the same devert. As nowe by the, O Troyalus deare, I plainely may appeare, Dothe ought resemble yet the shape That Cresyade once did beare? It cannot be: but nowe, but nowe, My ghost must hence depart, I feile the stinge of gaspinge deathe Dothe strayne me by the harte. No gratefull token may I send, My golden giftes are scante; My harte to send thou might refuse, And say it truthe dothe wante. Except a ringe nought ells I haue Which thou me gave that night That ioyned was our hartes in one, And faythe to others plight; The which I send in Paper lapte, Bewashed with my teares, By him that beares my latest lynes And funerall that heares. But this had I almoste forgott, So troubleth deathe my mynde, That thou voutchsafe tentere the corps That of thyne armes hathe wynde, And on my Tombe some Epitaphe Engraue as lykes the beste. So fayre the well!—this lipers knight Can showe of me the rest. Finis. XXXI. [Whilst brazen bodies breathing flames of fire.] Whilst brazen bodies breathing flames of fire So fierclie charge that euen themselues retire, The noice seemd that which doth so fearfull proue When lightning guides the thunderbolt of Ioue; But Thowtes more lowde then it did soundes conuoy, Which shew loue lightned, and the clapp was joy, A joy by rauish'd myndes so reall proud As proues some mightie influence it mou'd. This uniuersall sympathie of mynds A great conjunctioune most stronglie bindes; The lights most glorious of our undersphœres Are joyn'd in one yet no eclipse appeares: For both propitious as to cleare our dayes Doe shyne while thus combyn'd with doubled rayes. No wonder then though all thinges act a part Where joy so naturall is and needes no art: The fire, the aire, the earth, the water, each Showes that it feeles the same though wanting speach. The fire (so scorning a confined flame) Doth blaze in publict as enlightning fame; The aire, glade messenger of joyfull soundes, Proude to be beaten entertaines their woundes; The earth (else dull) is nowe constrain'd to moue, Whilst joy doth beate the measure of our loue; The water, too, as to confyne them all, Is link'd to heauen by liquid chaines that fall; Yea, euen those symboles of ambiguous voice (For some bells sing, some howle with equall noice) Now as inspir'd with ioy speak clearelie thus: “Joy rings our rowling rounds then sing with vs: ‘Day neuer shin'd so cleare as doth this night, Whilst hearts all fir'd with zeale as sunnes give light.’” XXXII. [What is beutie.] What is beutie? if it be A reall thing, why may not I As well anothers beutie spie As thine, faire thing? for if alone Beutie were thine, the world wold mone A losse of judgement, haueing eys to see, Since others others loue as I doe thee. Therefore beleeue mee, beutie, as eyes foode Is but as they esteeme or badde or goode, I make the faire in thinking thou art so: Then, faire, denye me not what I bestowe. XXXIII. [Be as thow seemst, faire creature.] Be as thow seemst, faire creature, Or call not it unconstancie To change when that doth change I lou'd in thee. I think that nature wold haue made the faire: No questioune but shee aim'd to make the goode. But 't seemes thy froward nature her withstoode, So litle didst thou scape of being rare Of vertue: pittie onlie dost thou lake, And onlie frownes thy beutie fowle doe make. Haue pittie then: want frownes: the world shall see Thy beeing as thou seemst my constancie. XXXIV. [If when I die to hells eternall shade.] If when I die to hells eternall shade As ane idolater condemn'd I bee, Because a mortall beutie that doth fade I haue too long ador'd in creuell thee, Think not to scape, for, for thy tyrannie, Thou there shall be condemn'd as well as I. And for thy greater plague two hells shalt proue: The one the trew, wherein thy self shalt be; My hated lookes the other, pale with loue, Shall seeme each day and howre new hell to the. But I beholding thy bright shyning eyes Shall heauen enjoy amidst hells miseries.</field>

Although that Vertue soverane, and Love bene most conding For to have praise, and gaine renown aboue all earthlie thing, Wherethrough is gott, as men deserve, of right eternall name, That tract of tyme can not destroy, or blot away the same. My freind of laitt, unknowin ?it, I hold me close a whyill, If oght I can, whill tyme may serve to vtter furth my styill, My scribling and vnskilfull pen hath brought now to ane end The worke which I vnto ?our fyill most glaidlie wold commend. Sen that ?e vrge, and vthers so no longer to delay, If that my Muse will grant me ayd, I shall do as I may. I haue not drunkt of Helicon, nor hant Parnassus hill, for to professs in Poësie that I have art, or skill, Bot as now this, now that did move, and fancie tuik delytt, When tyme wes sparde from gryter cares I vsde sum thing to wryt, And not so much in to this sort, where vulgar toung is hard, As in the Latin most to frame I had alway regard, I thank ?ow for ?our courtesie till I may know, or sie My loving freind, which lovinglie hath wrytt thus vnto me. A coniecture of this his vnknowin freind takin out of his awin wordes. As everie man doth vse the termes belonging to his art, My freind I think a Fowlar bene, a Poët most expert, with falcone flight acquentit well, such thing his words doth say, And for his skill he worthie is to weare the laurell bay. youris at power Thomas Cargill. Ther is a Certaine Fowler, as I vnderstand Ther is a Certaine Fowler, as I vnderstand, a Fowler of Woodcocks, borne in Scotland, Whoe envyinge the Noble Sports of Sir Tristram, and of all the Noble hounters of Waltham, esteeminge the lyninge of a mooddie doock before the poursute of a Statlie boock, hath written an epitath in greate Scorne both in disgrace of the Hound and the Horne. It is true that hes giftes are exceedinge Rare; with whome I will not presewme to Compare: for there is not any Sorte or kinde of wine but Mast William can Speake the Launguage of the Vine. He Carowseth Stoutlie of the best Renish either in the Almane tongue or in the flemish; for the Wine of Courte of aniee and Maine, for wine of Canbrie and Sack of Spaine, for the Sweet wine of greece or of Fronnteinock, for gasconie wine or white wine of Courte, though he Speake not all theis language so well, as he loues the Lecor as I here tell, yet for soe much as to liquor doth belonge he can answere them all in theire owne tongue. Now his other Vertues are so exceedinge as thay cannot be exprest by a man of my breedinge: for such a Cosmogarpher I did neuer know betwene Charinge Crosse and Stratforde bowe, where there is not one Taverne ould or Newe but Mast William thereof hath taken a viwe. oh, what a Secrytarie he were at a neede, whoe Neuer vseth Candle of weeke or of reede! for he putteth the hard wax no sooner to his Nose then by vertue thereof the hard wax flowes, but Seeinge the Hote fumes of his fierie Face Sarue for a Stone where he Comes in place. And that he may no longer a Secretorie be to any Princes or bewtifull Ladie, because he Sonn bournes their fases as faste as Phebus firie beames vpon them Cast, I wishe that his head were giuen in Charitie to some honest man decaed and in powertie: for let him in his next epitath Cale me a lier if it Sarue not insteed of a seacole fier.
