      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. MOCKHEROICKS Alas! how many Geese are plucked by Men Who draw their Inspiration from the Pen; How many Paperwasters, for the Head Might wellemploy what none but Fools eÃ©r read; Tho' Fashions change, the cap has never yet Been to the Tasteânor ever will, I betâ Men may be Fools, as arrant as you please, The Name they hate, the Thing they bear with Ease. But I will set th' Example, and do thou Divinest Folly! place it on my Brow; One Fool makes many, so I trust that I Shall not want Followers, therefore I cry, With far more Zeal than Richard for a Horse, Careless of Brains or any greater Loss, Â«A Kingdom for a Foolscap.Â» tis the best Safeguard, when Commonsense has lost all Zest: Hard Truths displeaseâÃ©en Asses prick their Ears, And Kick; but with the Cap I feel no Fears; Safe thrÃ² the Madhouse I hold on my way, Fools mark the Cap, and laugh at all I say, Chuckling at one who seems more Fool than they; Thus like Achilles, armed from Top to Toe In Folly's-armour, unopposed I go; Thus freely I can speak my Thoughts, and some Will in the Caps' despite, I trust pierce home; The Few will see wherefore I put it on, The Head is not at Fault, the Cap alone; At least, I trust, the Heart's in the right Place, And from that, eÃ©n the Foolscap borrows Grace; And even such a Fool as I am, dares To have some Brains, when wiser men lose theirs; 'Tis all a Scramble, catch who will, who can, With borrowed Wits, the Fool becomes a man. Then if some Method in my Madness be, 'Tis got from Â«Malthus's EconomyÂ». But I must change my Tone, I like a Jest, Yet at ones own Expense, is not the best; Mark, Reader; I by nomeans say at mine, I love myself too well, I meant at thine!! But I'll be grave as any Clergyman When he asks who forbids the Marriageban; Or when with Argument profound and high, He pleads the cause of Tithes and Prophecy; Or as the Lawyer, when he cannot see, The way to find a Quibble or a Fee. Or Poet when a botchlike Rhyme he makes, Scratches his own, and Priscian 's bald Pate breaks, For they sometimes put words instead of Sense, Like Priests, when arguing Â«NonresidenceÂ»; The simile may stand, tho' but so so, For Priests as all the Oxford-Scholars Know, Can Logic chop, as they do in the Schools, To puzzle wisemen and convince eÃ©n Fools; Their Syllogisms stand as firm and true, On their own Bottoms, as a Tub can do; And if there nothing in the Inside be, 'Tis not their Fault, that was not meant to see; They must be with a certain Reverence viewed, And then the Argument holds doubly Good. But I will now be serious, so turn The leaf for Â«Thoughts that breathe and words that burnÂ», I don't mean burn thy Fingers, but thy Heart, If divine warmth my poor Verse may impart! And Oh! my God, our Hearts are cold indeed, Not warmth enough to quicken up the seed Of thy own blessed word; rank is the Soil, And weeds of Bane alone repay our Toil; For with unblessed Sweat it is bedewed, And Mammon, stern Taskmaster, long has stood Beside us, and as we have held the Lash Over the Slave, so He oÃ©r us, whose rash Inhuman Laws, in vicious Circle still Working, hurl back on our own Heads, the Ill At others aimed; Intolerance has sown Her seeds abroad, and when the Crop was grown, We reaped it, and the Harvest thus brought back, The Harvest of Iniquity, not slack Has borne its retribÃ¹tive crop here too, And of the bitter Bread, we eat, as due, Our share. For Fellowcreaturefeeling dead In Many, is the Leaven of the Bread Of Christian Freedom; and in vain we trust To be Freemen at Home, when by the Lust Of Gain, we're led to violate abroad The Rights of Man, at Home in vain adored. For whomsoe'er ye injure, 'tis a Man, Like your ownselves; his Rights are yours; nor can. Ye rob him of the least of these, and not Partake the Degradation of his Lot; Still in the same proportion as ye free Your Fellowmen, the freer will ye be. And He who makes one slave, will surely find, The chains of Prejudice his own Soul bind; He too who elsewhere Right, and Wrong confounds, Will not at Home o'erstrictly mark their Bounds. The Good of one man is that of the whole, Thro' all, the one can only reach the Goal, In each Man's Breast the Heart of all should be, And with the Eyes of all men should He see, Each in the whole, the whole in each combined, One man in Millions, Millions with one mind And Soul, one Heart within the Mighty Breast, Yea! God's own Heart, felt conscious in the least. DEDICATION TO THE SPIRIT OF HUMANITY. 1. To Thee, Great Spirit! in whose service, I, So long have toiled; with what success I know Not yet, but with a Heart where nothing low EÃ©r dwelt, nor Thought save of thy Ministry, I dedicate these offerings! thine Eye, Thy Godlike Eye, hath watched me until now, Thou nobler Mother, from whose Breast doth flow The pure, strong Milk of Human Charity. Far other Gifts beseem thee, than a few Poor Verses, Gifts which Ã©en the meanest can Afford thee, as the greatest! better than Vain Gold or Incense. Actions, Actions true To Nature and to Thee, these are thy Due, Whose chosen Home is in the Heart of Man! 2. Up from my Boyhood have I loved thy ways, And for thy sake, I tuned my Ear, till by The deep, sweet music of Humanity, My Heart was filled to overflowing! Praise Be to thy holy Name; Thou in the Days, When Form and Custom weave most easily Their slavish Chains, didst Keep me free; 'twas thy Wise schooling taught me to revere Man's Face In all alike! in all to recognize A holy Being; no one greater than Another, but all from and of the skies! And thou ,thou taught'st me too, in Life's brief Span, Its Crowninggrace, the aim of all the wise, With king or beggar, still to be, a Man! SUNSETTHOUGHT. The Sun is burning with intensest Light Behind yon Grove; and in the golden Glow Of unconsuming Fire, it doth show, Like to the Bush, in which to Moses' Sight The Lord appeared! and oh! am I not right In thinking that He reappears eÃ©n now To me, in the old Glory, and I bow My Head, in wonder hushed, before his Might! Yea! this whole world so vast, to Faiths' clear Eye, Is but that burning Bush, full of his Power, His Light, and Glory; not consumed thereby, But made transparent; till in each least Flower! Yea! in each smallest Leaf, she can descry, His Spirit shining thrÃ² it visibly! WHEREIN ALL MEN MAY BE GREAT. The greatest Man is not so great, but we May imitate him, so far as he is A Man; for to be quite a Man, this, this Is in the Reach of all! however He be, In Wealth, Power, Genius, raised above us, He Is but our equal as a Man; nay his Best Glory is to be so! let him miss This brightest Crown of true Humanity, And he is no more Great! in doing Good, None need be little, for the Poorest can Give most, tho' but the crust which is his Food! And He Alluding to Milton, who was greater as a man, than as a Poet.whom Fancy Here used for Imagination. with her Rainbowspan Made first of Poets, by a pure Heart could Be, and was, something more; He was, a Man. ON OBTAINING THINGS BY GENTLE MEANS. Seek nothing thro' brute Force, when thou canst by Love win itâif not, let it go, and nought Will be lost, be assured. The Good you thought To find, would be no more so, for in thy Own Soul, its whole worth lies; and foolishly, Thou vexest, troublest that, for the Thing Sought, The great Good for the less! and how can aught Divine, impart its own Sublimity Unto the Soul, when our own Feelings grow Distuned by Strife? and besides these is no Medium for Godlike Things; but that wihch we Obtain by Love, tho' little worth it be, Brings this chief Good with it; it puts the Soul In Harmony with itself, and this Whole, This lovely Whole, and does so thro' our own Best Feelings; and if it did this alone, Methinks the greatest Good of all Earths' Store, Gained otherwise, could not enrich us more; Nor half so much; for what we feel, that is Real wealth; and Love, however caused is Bliss, In itself perfect, and who can have more than this? GREATNESS. In little Things a man may still be great; Nay, He who is not So in these, will nÃ©er Be great in great Things-Lifes' most weekday Sphere, Yields Opportunities, and every State Occasions endless, by which to create True Grandeur both of Heart and Mind-whoÃ©er Lives simply and thinks grandly, need not fear That He to work the Godlike long must wait. Had Christ thought thus, he would not have preached to The Poor and Humble-'tis the Feelings, by Which all's ennobled-and if these be true And Godlike, what have Time or Place to do Therewith? the Man alone attracts the Eye Of God, and what is sublime in his View, Cannot be small in anyones, except In his, who is far less than leastâtho' nought But the Crust by the hungry Beggar kept For his poor halfstarved Dog, whose Life is bought By his own Pains, sublimed, forgotton in that Thought. ON SEEING ALL THINGS IN THEIR TRUE LIGHT. 1. See, on this mean Room and its scanty store Of rude Utensils, how the Settingsun, Resting his Disk, in purple Glory, on Yon massy Cloud, a Magiclight doth pour, Till Life's most coarse Materials seem no more That which they were, but o'er their Forms is thrown A holy Beauty, which, tho all their own, Yea, as the Diamond's hidden worth before 'Tis polished, yet escapes the vulgar Eye; In semblance glorified, they stilly stand Like Implements framed for an Angel's Hand, For higher wants and uses! verily They are; and when this gorgeous Light shall die, Which turns to sparkling gems, eÃ©n this coarse sand, Strewed o'er the Floor of want and Poverty 2. A Higher glory still on them shall brood, Higher than all the Hues of sunset can Bestow, that Glory which the Heart of Man Imparts to all it hallows unto Good; And are they not framed for an Angel? Could An Angelshand employ them better than This poor, poor Labourer, whom each Day's span, Sees toiling for a wife's and children's Food? And Lo! the Light has fled; the purple Glow Fades from the Plates, the sand, and broken chair, And all things seem just simply what they were, And are, Life's coarsest Necessaries; to Wich Fancy will not stoop, nor deign to throw One, one sole Hue, to make them seem more fair! 3. And She does Ill, to turn from that which lies Before her; from Life's daily Hopes and Fears, Its wants and Toils, its sorrows and its Tears, Its yearnings and its holy sympathies; For'tis by these alone, that we can rise To Being's Height; in this School wisdom rears The truly great and good, in whom, nor years, Slack love, Hate, Envey, Grief, can paralyze The Human Heart by which they live alone; The Milk of Humankindness, their first Food Flows still within their veins, turned to Lifeblood! 'Tis by Life's lowliest Duties, tho' it were To bind the Beggar's Bandage gently on His wound, that we grow perfect; nay, we are Not even Men except thro' these! and there Is no, no office, howsoever mean, But Love can make it holy, sweet and fair Pure as the Star that sparkles on Evesbrow; For Nought is mean or low, that man has done For his own Brother man, save to the Low! And the most low, is he who has not been Yet Man; for what of Good or Noble can He be or do, who is not first, a Man! 4. Then be thou wiser, and instructed by The sublime Lesson taught thee even now By holy Nature, deem thou naught too low To claim a passing Notice from thine Eye; Look at it, 'tis not what it seems; till thy Own Soul has in all Meekness sought to Know Its End and uses, 'twill no token show Of what it is. Did not the purple sky Embathe with Beauty like a Poet's Dream, But even now, this Room! did it despise To steep in Glory, what so vile doth seem? Do but as Nature, she is ever wise. For that brief Glory, let a steady Beam Of Human Love be thrown on all which lies Around thee, from thy Soul, tho'it be nought But the rude spade with which that man has wrought; The cradle, where his sickly Infant cries: Then 'neath the harsh Light of Reality, They'll seem to thee more lovely than when by The Settingsun to them such Hues were brought, As charm not Fancy's vainlydreaming Eye! WONDERWORKING. 1. Oh Fool! He who has heartfelt Faith indeed, Asks for no miracles! He knows too well, All round and in him is a miracle, From Stars and Sun, down to the Mustardseed! The Man who asks for Miracles, has need Of one, the greatest of them all, a spell To open eyes and ears andâheart; then he'll Behold the miracles he seeks for, spread Thicker than stars by nightâwith all that lies Around her, yea, with most familiar things Faith works her wonders; could she not comprize Within the span of her outstretched wings, An Empire vast as that above the skies, Then were my words, but vain Imaginings! 2. The wiseman can work wonders! yea, he can, Most Marvellous; with his own minutes, He Can transform Time into Eternity, Compress the Boundless into Life's brief Span, And wake the slumbering Angel in the Man, All-save the wings! nay, these too; Thoughts supply Their place-for with his thoughts a man can fly EÃ©n to Godsthrone, where neither Sight may scan, Nor wing dare follow! Miracles are wrought The most, the best, with our own Thoughts, which are Like bands of Angels, ready to do aught We bid them! yea! like spirits, when welltaught, They serve us; and o'er them God's sway we share O'er Angels, being like him allmighty there; And as to him by Angels, so is brought Us by our Thoughts, all that we wished and sought! HOW TO MAKE THE WORLD PLEASANT. Seek not to alter things; but alter thou Thy mode of looking at them. Thy Soulseye, Such power dwells in the Godlike faculty, Can turn what seems most distort to thee now To best Proportion; until all things grow Around thee, into perfect harmony With thine own Being. And how easily Canst thou accomplish this! how much, oh how Much easier, methinks, this simple way, Yet most effectual, to change all things To that which thou wouldst have them be! for say, Are they not by thine own Imaginings As truly changed, and brought beneath thy sway, (As 'neath the skilful hand the LyrÃ©s strings With the whole compass of its melody) As if thou wert, like God, Allmighty? yea! Thou canst build up the world so lovelily, In thine own mind, that thou shalt on thy way Move joyous and content, nÃ©ertroubled by The Ills that fret the heart, and turn the hair to gray! WEEKDAY WONDERWORKING. One Day I prayed, that Heaven would send me down An Angel, that the same might confort me, And as a token everafter be. And Lo! my prayer was heard; no form was shown, Unto Mine eye; 'twas in the Soul alone He made his presence felt; Heaven's Gifts must 'we Receive, as they are given, Spiritually, Thus soul to soul can only be made known. WhenÃ©er our hearts are warmed by Divine Thought, When past Gooddeeds urge gently on to new, Then is the Angel sent, for whom we sought, He ministers to us; we ourselves do Become the Angel which we prayed for, wrought To that diviner shape our wishes drew! Thus God gives more than what we ask forâNay! He himself is in us, when we sincerely pray! WEEKDAY WONDERS. 1. No Poet gives to his divinest Dream, The Depth and Breadth, th'Etherial Beauty thrown By Weekday Nature, without Effort on Life's most familiar Object-with one Beam Of purple Sunlight, She can make it seem More magicfair than aught that Ã©er was shown In Fairytale, to dreaming Fancys' own Enraptured eye-She pours above the Stream The Golden Moonlight, and behold! it flows Like Fableriver thro' enchanted Land! Was Ã©er the waist of Homer's Venus spanned By Zone of Beauty, like to that she throws Each Day round earth, or could Magician's wand Frame aught more lovely than the Child or Rose? His sweetest Thoughts the Poet, at her Hand Receives, and He the greatest is, who knows To poetize like her, to make his verse A deep, clear Echo, of this so, so grand Yet silent Poem of the Universe! 2. Behold a wonder of her Working! Nigh The Couch, all hush'd, and chaste, I stand, where lies She who should be my Bride. Upon her Eyes The melting Darkness, and the pure Dreams, by Whose fair Shapes, Angels lend their Ministry Unto the Good, still lingÃ¨râ'tis Sunrise; And Lo! Ã©en now his light with Purple dies Has steeped the Curtains, So, So, lovelily, That like a Rosyveil they shade her Sleep, And with Etherial Blushes tinge her Brow! The Sense of wonder fills my Soul so deep, This Miracle wrought here for me, seÃ©ms so, Unreal, yet is so real, thas I scarce know Whether, or where I am, but turn and weep! 3. She is but in a Dream! yet doth she seem Herself like one, and all that's round me here, I also; yet I see all this as clear As waking Eyes can do! 'tis no vain Dream! But given to the yearning Heart, to be Clasped to the Breast, a calm Reality! And is this Angel; yea! Such will I deem Her, destined for these mortal Arms? then hear My Prayer, Oh God! and grant that I may n'eer Embrace her but as such-that as the Beam Of thy bless'd Sunlight shows her to me now, So chaste, so pure, so holy in my Eyes, That thus still undefiled by Passions low, Her Form in its first Loveliness may rise To Afterview; that gazing on her Brow, With Sight sublimed by fearless Faith, and high Imagination's Divine Power, Ine'er Forget that She is destined for the skies! Ne'er bring a Blush to her chaste Cheek, a Tear To that soft Eye, nor sully but with one Unworthy Thought or Deed, the Angel by My side, but still behold in Her, alone The Godlike Being, sleeping neath mine Eye! And now softkneeling by the Couch, I kiss Chastely, the white Hand drooping gently down, While Fancy, busy with some Dream of Bliss, Blends Magiclike, th' Impression with her own Pure formsâAnd Lo! she dreams an Angel bright Kneels by her side! God! grant that she be right! Grant that believing it myself, I grow That Angel and that she may find me so! And that the Angel of her Dream may be, But what her waking Eye will daily see; Yea! give me Faith but to fulfill my Prayer, For that which we believe we really are! 4. And Thou, vain Fancy! with what Dream wouldst thou Replace that which I gaze on, if once lost? Tho' thou shouldst bring back Youth, and o'er me throw His Magicmantle, yet thou couldst at most Wrap me in unreal Joys! but here I have, More, far more than thy Charmingwand Ã©er gave To favored Poet-And all Palpable As Broaddaylight-but where hast thou a Spell, That thus can realize the wildest Dream And bind it to the Humanheart whereby We live, with during Ties of Flesh and Blood, And thence, of weekday Bliss, draw the full Stream! This Wonder of all Wonders, a Good God Enables us to work, who moulded Heart And Fancy for eachother's Aid; then part Not that which He has joined; for Thou thereby, If but once thou hast learnt the Godlike Art, Een Fancy's most Ethereal Tints mayst throw O'er the coarse Forms of harsh Reality, Till nothing longer shall seem mean or low, But all, all Godlike-yea! till thou canst make The coarse, hard Convass of Life's worst Day, take Hues which a Raphael's Hand could ne'er impart: A Grand Cartoon! wherein thyself and all Thy Fellowmen, as Angels walk, and where, Each thing, yea Ã©en the least, serves to recall, The End for which we breathe, and live and are! TRUE GREATNESS. The truly Great, is great in all Things; there Is nothing little unto Him, for He In small Things sees great Principles-most free From Pomp, most grand-a Statue massive, bare, From Nature's Quarry hewn; for his works are, Like God's, enduring, and his Eye can see No Littleness, where aught that lives may be Made happier, nor aught beneath his Care, Tho' but the worm beneath his Feet. His Mind Is Catholic; his Eye is single, clear, Like God's, and when therein thou seest a Tear, 'Tis as if Christ himself wept for Mankind; His views are large; no Partyfeelings blind, No names delude him; far too wide his sphere For these; for allembracing is his Heart, And in it Ã©en the least Thing has a Part, Yea! Ã©en his Enemies; He loves them all, And would be ready at his Master's call To shed his Blood for them; his Sympathies Are comprehensive; from the Household Hearth, Their surest Cradle, they embrace all Earth, But thither still return for fresh Supplies; For He who loves not his own Home, how should He love the State? who has not grown a good Man there, how can He be a noble or Good Citizen? or how observe the Law Of Man, who that of God observes not, nor Has learnt to read it, in his own Heart, by The Light of Love-Here is the great Man still More great, for he has Duties to fulfill, Without which He could not be Ã©en a Man; First in his Home he grows all that He can Become, of great and Godlike, thro' his wife And Children, conscious first of what this Life May be wrought into, and of what He owes To God and Man, for his Sake and for theirs, Who gave this Life its nobler Hopes and Cares. Go! Seek him there then; haply at the Plough, Like Cincinnatus, you may find him now, Neath God's own open Sky, and like it free And Sublime in man's naked Majesty, Heart, Ear, and Eye, familiar with the Sights And Sounds of Nature; to her loftiest Heights Ascending, easy as the Eagleswing Unto the Mountaintops, scarce conscious of His Grandeur, without Effort, far above Ambition's Ken; yet with the meanest Thing Still sympathizing; comprehending it In its own kind, and turning it to fit- -Est use and Service; still extracting Good, Like God, from Evil, by that sublime Mood, Which thinking that whatever is, is right, At length can make it so, in selfdespite! This is the man to rule a State, whose Soul, Epitomizes in itself, the whole! Who grasps both Great and smallâin small Things great, For small Things make up greatest-Yea! the state Itself, is made of these, and He who is Not great therein-true Greatness still must miss! For grand occasions He lies by, that men May point their Fingers at Him, and the Pen Of Fame, bepraise Him; meanwhile, scorn'd as nought, Full many thousand small Events have wrought Out mightiest Issues, 'neath the watchful Eye Of Wisdom, toiling for Humanity! Yea! mightier, far mightier, than those He seeks, tho far less noisy-Lo! the Rose Has climbed meanwhile round many a Cottagedoor, And Nature helps to humanize the Poor; The barren Field now laughs, and many a Nook Rejoices, where Ambition could not brook To stoop his Eye; Art unto Nature lends Her Hand, with her toils to sublimer Ends; Hallows familiar Things to higher Use, And opens Hearts impervious to the Muse Till now, by means despised, unthought of-yea! These, these are Triomphs, like the Light of Day, Beneficent and universal-these The Trulygreat prefers to crowned Ease, Or Cesar's Laurels; He toils for Mankind And like God, his best Recompence will find In his own Heart; a Nation's Joy is his, And who can come more near to God than this? He is Ã  Perfect Man, for Millions blend Their Hearts with his, to that most sublime End; He has exalted and perfected thro' His Laws, Mankind; and Mankind, as is due, Has perfected him also; for the one Man, thro' all, grows a perfect Man alone! ON THE PLANET LUCIFER. How still and holy that bright Star upon Th' Horizon's Verge is burning; silent there He fills with modest splendour all the Air, Unenvious and unenvied-tho' the Sun Will merge him in his gorgeous Rise anon, He no least Sign of Discontent doth wear! So be thy Soul, as if that Star so fair Were burning stilly, in thy Breast. If one Greater than thou, shine forth upon Mankind, With one meek Triomph be Content. Altho' Lost for awhile to Man, God is not blind! Shine on tho' unobserved, for there is no, No Littleness-Beams make that Sun, thy mind Too is a Beam of God-as such then know And feel it, for unfelt it is not so! The Godlike is of God the Consciousness; Be conscious then and in Him all possess! POVERTY. Talk not of Rich or poor; for in the Eye Of God, all, all are equal; there is none So poor, but can find words to call upon Him, and to say with meek Sublimity, Â«Our Father which art in Heaven,Â» for 'tis by That name He loves best to be called; and on This Earth, which he has blessed for all, no one Is poor who feels in its whole Force, the high And Divine Solace of that noblest Prayer! The poorest wretch may call him Father, more The richest cannot do; and those who are The most in need of him, the Heart made sore By Grief, the Childless, Fatherless, who bear His Cross in Meekness, feel its sublime Lore The most, and by their very Poverty Inherit all the Treasures of the Sky! And what, tho' seemingboundless, is Earths' Store, Compared with Heaven's; from whose Treasury, One Single Jewell calm Content, can give All Riches summed in one; the Power to live With Heart as serene as there up on high, Some bright Star, shining still and holily! He, He alone is poor! who never felt That Prayer, nor to God as his Father knelt! ON FANCYDREAMERS WHO THINK REAL LIFE TOO COMMONPLACE FOR THEM. Â«What would'st thou breathe, if not this Common Air!Â» Is it not Ether? are thy Fellowmen Not with thee here as Angels? what more then Canst thou require? view Man as if He were All that is Godlike! and let all who bear That Name be holy to thee; yea! Ã©en when 'Tis'but a Beggar, give him back again His Greeting in all Love and Awe, nor dare To think the least ill thought of him when gone! And then, the more, more sobermindedly Thou breathest this air, which makes us Men alone, As simply what it is, The deeper thy Belief that all are Godlike, from thine own Heart feeling it; the more Reality Thou givest this Truth in Act, unshaken by Vain Doubts and Fancies, then wilt thou have grown By so much more an Angel, that thine Eye In all who meet thee'neath the holy Sun Will see nought but the Angelâyea! thou' It own That Fancy's Dreams were but a gilded Lie, And that this Common Air which we live on, Is the pure Ether of God's blessed Sky! NATURE. 1. Oft mighty Nature herself plays for me Overagain, the Music of the Past. Not broken notes as erst, but the whole vast And boundless Compass of her Harmony; From the loud Thunder, to the Cricket's Glee; And something more than this, oh something more I hear, aud of a far diviner Power, The touching music of Huuianity; The deep Bass now of all her Harmonies. In Snatches I have felt it from the first; Oft have the Villagebells brought to mine eyes The Tear, I knew scarce why-but it has burst On me at length, with its full melodies; And clearly its deep Import, not as erst Unconsciously, in all I' recognise! 2. What we entrust to Nature's keeping, She Will beautify a thousandfold, for our Enlarged Perceptions, at some future Hour; And if from youth we walk in her ways, the Music of our own Hearts, will blended be With her Eternal Music; ever more, More, clearly felt-not distinct as before, But needful Parts of one full Harmony! The Music which in Boyhood charmed my Ear, The Voice of Villagebell, of Bird, and Brook, Was set to Hopes and yearnings, which, tho' dear, And deep, and holy, their sole Impulse took From Home's so blessed, yet still narrow, sphere; Music, which few beyond would care to hear! Yet Since that too was hers, still as I grew, Did she enlarge, as she is wont to do, For those who put their Trust in her alone Its sphere and compass, till it now runs thro' The whole vast Scale, down to the smallest tone The least, least note, to living Creature known! Till this wide Earth seems now but as my Home, Dear and familiar to me, as the Room, Where in the holy Concert, small yet true, My Heart with those of all I loved, wÃ s like A string, which Nature's Hand Ã©en then did strike. But now this nobler Music is set to The Hopes and yearnings of this vaster Home, For ever echoing up to Heavensdome, And mingling with the music of the spheres; Which Ã©en the living God, delighted, hears, The deep, sweet music of Humanity! So deep, that its least Tone can stir to Tears! And in its sublime swell of Harmony, Nature, my nobler Mother grown, plays o'er Again for me the Music sweet of yore Not lost, but as a soft, deep Undertone Blent with, for aye, and still more like, her own! For that which is true to the Heart, she keeps, In her own Blessedness and Beauty steeps; Thus the first song that charmed our childish Ear, Is still the sweetest Music we can hear! TO CLARKSON, ON THE PASSING OF THE SLAVETRADEABOLITIONBILL. 1. Thriceblessed Day! thriceholy is thy Light To these expectant Eyes! how shall I raise Not allunworthily, a Hymn of Praise For this great Triomph o'er the Powers of Night? Thou makst this common Earth as Eden bright, With this glad Promise, these Firstfruits of Days But dreamt of, and of which thy blessed Rays Are fittest Harbingers: beam on my Sight, Oh let me fill mine Eyes with Thee, and kneel, Yet utter no vain Prayer; but only feel My Blessedness, and make of that my Hymn. Like to a Prisoner whose sight is dim With long, long watching, and whose senses reel When Freedom's radiant smile first breaks on him! 2. Thriceblessed Day! in this great Jubliee, I feel that Nature's Universal Heart In all its thousand Pulses takes a Part: Again it breathes, again, in holy Glee, The lifeblood gushes thro' it strong and free. Like to a Giant wakened, didst thou start From out thy sleep, my Country, and thou art Now broadawake and long, I trust, wilt be; The Power of God was on thee in thy Sleep, And troubled Dreams of Blood not washed away, Disturbed thy slumbers, but within thy deep And mighty Heart, still conscience held her Sway, And at th' Allmighty's voice thou forth didst leap To hallow unto Her this blessed Day! 3. Unto the Lord of Hosts be given the Praise, For mighty is He what can he not do! The changing Mists of Time are rent, and thro' That opening, the Ether clear displays Its Glories, and the gathered Angels raise A Hymn of Promise, that Earth shall renew Herself; then ye, ye flowers hear it too, Put forth your Blossoms, and make sweet Her ways, For love and Mercy will descend on Earth! It was a Godlike Thought! thou gav'st it Birth, Oh God! thy spirit stirred Men's Hearts; the Flame Of Sacred Indignation and deep shame, That fused so many thousand Souls in one Resistless Feeling of pure Justice, came From thy sole Inspiration, thine alone! And nobly has it testified its Worth. All separate Thoughts, Wills, Voices, all were blent Into one mighty wish, Intelligent And instinct with the Power of thy name, One mighty Heart; yea! God! it was thine own; Its Hope was thine, and with thy Voice it spake; And silence followed in the thunder's wake, So soulssubduing, solemn, and so deep, The pause of Feeling, and the holy calm, As at some wonder worked by Divine Charm, That Earth lay like a Flower hushed in Sleep, Or Bade scarcebreathing on his Mother's Arm! 'Twas no faint Purpose of a single Breast; In th' universal Bosom did it take Its sublime Origin; and was exprest In that eternal language, in which Love Kneels at thy throne, and prays to theeabove To stretch thy Righthand forth, for Mercyssake! 4. And next to God! Praise, Praise, be to thy Name, Glory and Blessings everlastingly, To thee, Apostle of Humanity, Who made thy Life a Hymn unto the Same! Thy Name should be inscribed with Living Flame And run, like Lightning seen of every Eye, Round the vast Dome of God's own blessed Sky, The Polestar for each Godlike Thought and Aim! But thou shalt have a nobler Recompense, Dearer and bettersuited to such Mind; Thou shalt in every Heart a Temple find; On every Lip, in every Tongue, from hence- -Forth shall thy Name become a Household-Word, So holy, that like God's, it shall be heard Never without deep Awe and Reverence, By Any worthy to be called a Man! And on the Page of History thy name Far, Far too mighty for the Trump of Fame, In Front of this great chapter, with a Span Of Rainbowglory wove from Heavenslight, Like that shall stand, and like that too in Height, Bove king and Conqueror towering thro' the sky, A Sign and Token to Eternity! THE STARS. The Stars come forth, a silent Hymn of Praise To the great God, and shining everyone, Make up the glorious Harmony, led on By Hesperus their Chorister: each Plays A Part in the grand Concert with its Rays, And yet so stilly, modestly, as none Claimed to himself aught of the Good thus done By all together, mingled in soft Blaze. Each has his Path, there moves unerringly, Nor seeks for empty Fame: do we as they. Let each Soul lend its utmost Light, each play In the grand Concert of Humanity Its destined Part-then mankind on its way Shall move as surely as those stars on high! PRAYER. Hear me, Oh Father: hear, and grant that I May work out something for thy Glory now, Tho' but to bring a Blush unto the Brow Of Mammon's slave, a soft Tear to the Eye Of wretched Sinner, thro' which to descry Some Mercymissioned Angel drop below To comfort Him; or Thou thyself; for no Eye sees thee clearer, unto none seems thy Pure Presence, so, so unapproachable, So far; as to the contrite Sinner's; who, Looking but at the Height from whence he fell, Not at thy Mercy, sinks dismayed into His Sorrow; yet 'tis just for this, thou art Nearer than ever, yea! in his own Heart! Pardon me Father, if I ask not well: Thou hast no need of me or Mine, to move The Heart of Man to Worship and to Love; Thou mads't it; 'tis thy Mastermiracle! And if the Dayseye speaks so eloquent Of thee, which is less than intelligent, Shall that be silent in which thou dost dwell? Yet would I show the Love that fills my Breast; Grant me thy Blessing thenâthat is the best Of Inspirations! and with that, whate'er I think, feel, say, or do, will, like the year Which thou hast bless'd likewise, bring forth' unto Thy Praise, in its fit Season, and so tell Of Thee, and bear the Stamp of whence it drew Whatever Good is in it; yea! as clear As in that Sinner's Eye the holy Tear! NATURE. 1. How Magicfair the Sunsetlight falls on This newploughed Field, a Gold-and-Purpleshower Of softlymellowing Beams, which make this, our So coarse familiar Earth, like ground, upon Which Angels might descendâthe seed just sown, Like golden Grain, such as Earth never bore, Seems destined for their reaping, not for poor, Poor mortal HarvestersâOh! Nature, one One moment longer, let this vision here Be offered to mine Eyesâthat I may gaze And fill my Heart and Soul with that which ne'er Was better learn'd than from thy holy ways; The deep Morality, the Wisdom clear, Divine, yet practical, which thy least work displays! 2. 'Tis in the Bosom of this our weekday Existence, in Life's daily Soil, that we Must sow the Godlike, True, and Duringâthe Heart's most familiar Affections lay The Basis of real happiness, and, yea! Of all true Greatness, else 'twill fade and be Forgotten-Therefore in this Soil we see All mighty Growths, ordained to last for aye, Have struck their Roots: for that which to the skies Would tower, must firmly grasp the Earth, and by Its depth below the higher upward rise! Thence sprung the Shakespears and the Homers, nigh To Godsâwhose mighty Bosoms could comprize The Changeless Heart of all Humanity; The Nation's Heart was theirs; with Nature's Eyes, They saw-with her voice spake her mysteries, Nay, she is one with them Eternally! ON BEING MUCH ALONE. 'Tis ill to be alone, at least in Thought Be never thou so. Fancy that by Thee A radiant Angel ever stands, that He Is sent by Providence, to note down aught Unworthy thought or done, when thou deem'st nought Is by, to mark-Thus will an Angel be Really close at thy side, tho' thou canst see His Form not, and his Presence will be fraught With Blessings, as if he were visible! Thus thine own Thoughts grow to pure Angels here, Thy best, thy Guardianangels! and quite near, Yea! in thee, Heaven, with all its Joys may dwell! Oh Wonder! yet familiar and as clear As that each in himself doth bear the Spell! ON SIMPLE ENJOYMENTS. 1. Our Feelings make us rich, and how rich He Into whose Eye the Daisy at his Feet Can bring a Tear of Rapture! He will meet Fresh Joy in all that He can hear and see. Then learn thou to feel deeply, tho it be Butfor a Flower. What can be more sweet Than deep and simple Feelings, by the Heat Of Nature herself nursed, like her own free, Strong, racy Growths, upspringing everywhere And yielding tenfold, oft where we no Seed Have sown-So quickly natural Pleasures breed, That where we pluck but one, we scatter there The seeds of fifty sweeter ones, which need Naught but a little natural warmth to bear. 2. If then our Feelings make us rich, take Heed To mould them rightly; to feel simply and Yet grandly, and thy thoughts will be more grand, The simpler and the truer that they be; The Godlike art of seeing, is to see Things as they are, as God has made them, as He meant them, not as twisted in the Glass Of human Prejudice. Thou with a Thought Hast Heaven, nay God Himself, in spirit brought Before thee, when thou feelst in its full Bliss The Beauty of the smallest Flower, which is Steeped in the Morningdew upon the sod; Then in that Feeling thou enjoyest God, Himself draws near: for in the least of Things, There is no Littleness, when thus it brings The full Sense of the Infinite: in all God dwells, and thus the Flower, however small, That scarce is stirred by the Eveningair The overpowering Sense of him doth bear. God is in all, and He is All, thus who Feels Him within the Flower, feels there too The Whole, and thus too in itself each Soul Enjoying God, enjoys in Him the whole, Tho but a Sandgrain to it-and how can He be called poor, who has so wide a span Of Pleasure, truly kinglike, as thus to Possess the Whole, which the most poor can do? And what more has the Monarch on his Throne? The Show of that the Beggar calls his own! Then school thy Feelings God in all to see, And with this Feeling, fill thy Heart, till He Alone possesses it; then thou wilt feel, Like Him, Mankind's least Joy as thine own weal! The Blessedness of all will thus be thine, And if this be not Happiness divine, I know not then what is-Oh! trust me, far, Far more Imagination is required, To see Things simply as they really are, In their deep, sublime Truth, than Ã©er inspired The airy Visions of the Poet's Brain. This Realdaylife is running o'er again With Poesy, tho' seldom Poets Lip Thereat unconsciously, has ta' en a Sip. And for the Pilgrim on its dusty way, The genuine Fount still gushes up for aye, The Fount of Human Love, which needs no spell, No Pegasean Hoof, no Miracle, But flows hard by each Door, like its own Household well! SELFGREATNESS. The Beggarsstaff has oft a wider sway Than the kingssceptre! vaster Empire far, Far nobler subjectsâhis own thoughts, which are Best ministers of Good from Day to day! Content, He forms no fretting wish to stray Beyond his destined Sphere, where, like a star, His soul moves calm and still, above the war Of Earth's vain cares, on its Eternal way. Till thus become a Spirit, Spirits wait Upon him, ever round thaut viewless throne Which He, on Passions earlytaught to own Wisdom's supremacy, has raised, a State Wherein Celestial Powers have sway alone; The Lord of his own Soul is truly great! DAY-DREAMING. I see them rise; the forms of other Days, And this strange Room, and all these objects here, That speak not to the heart, with one light wave Of Fancyswand, are gone like unreal things. Yea! like a dream, give place to a real dream, Which for the Moment is by far more true, And has a far more real Existence, than The palpable Objects which around me stand. Then mark one Thing well! Dreams are actual Life; That which we feel alone exists to us, And what we feel not, is as if 'twere not; Thus absent Things are often nearer and More present than the Present themselves, yea! What we have lost is thus more at our Heart Than what we have! but you may justly ask, Â«How can it then be lost!Â» yea! verily, Thou sayst it: that which we have at the Heart Is never lost, until that Heart itself Be crumbled into Dust; for what do we Possess so truly as that which we have At Heart? then take all Godlike Things to Heart, And none wilt thou Ã©er lose; nor Love, nor Youth, Nor Friendship, nay, they become more thine own! Before they were withont thee, but they now Are in thee, with thee, yea! unto the last, More beautiful from being lost, and more Truly existent because they exist No longer! is not this a wonder! yea! And yet so true that thou hast but to think And it is wrought! then dream thou wisely, dream Rightoften, till possessing in thy Dreams Whatever thou hast lost, thou canst no more Lose anything; until thou com'st to think The waking Notion of some bitter Loss, An idle Dream! till, Ã©en when from thy Dream Thou wak'st, thou bringÃ«st with thee into Life, A firm Belief that thou hast nothing lost; And then, then be assurred thou really hast Lost Nothing! thus, thus often do I dream, And were I at such moment roused, I should Feel like one suddenly transported to Some unknown World; the eventful Interval Forgot, in which I grew from Boy to man; The tears, the Heartbreak, and the sufferings; And I should wake just as I was of old, At heart the very, very selfsame Boy, Whose timeuntouchÃ«d form I now behold. I see the Armchair by the Fireside, Wherein my Father sat, and connÃ«d o'er The Daysnewspaper, full of sound and noise, Of bubbles which have burst, of news so stale, That were a man to read it now, it would Set him ayawning, tho' He reads the same, Or like, each morning, and bewunders, and Bestares his neighbour, knowing not that there Is nothing new beneath the sun; That he Himself alone, is new in this grey Earth. Now see I too my Brothers, happy Boys, Full of their schemes, and laying out their time, As if the Hourglass was held by their And not his hand; as if with all their strength, They could urge on one little, little grain, Before th' allotted moment, or retard It but a second, tho'it were about To drag them down into the darksome grave. And there is the old Housedog, muchbeloved, And loving much too, living on from meal To meal, yet by Affection dignified. And there I see myself, or rather there I feel myself, and am; once more a boy! The load of fifteen years thrown from my heart. And if the moments in Time's glass still run, While I thus dream, at least I grow not old With them, as on they speed-I do but live Them o'eragain, and rob them from the Past. And could I but preserve within my breast The young heart of that Dream, Oh! I should go Down to the Grave still with a Child's glad soul; As little touched by Care as is the flower, As joyous as the wave which breaks upon The beach, then sinks back to the Mighty Deep From whenee it had its being: and if this Be not attainable, yet still at least, I from Time's spiritgalling yoke, have drawn My neck, and like the weary steed, have breathd In Peace awhile-then once more on my way, In calm content, and hoping all things good, Yea making them so by that very hope, I move, and from my deep heart there is sent, A perfume, as from flowers but just fill'd With freshest dew, which maketh sweet the breath, The weekday and familiar breath of Life, Yea! sweet as that of Paradise-as tho' I were an angel! Lo? I am so now, Tho' but for one brief moment; for the heart Which beats so blessedly within my breast, Is that same pure and loving heart which at Life's dawn, fresh from the hands of God himself, Lit up my young eyes in their deep Delight, When for the first time opening gently up, They met my Mother's holy face bent o'er Me like an angel's, from that sphere, which I Had but just left. Thus Heaven is everywhere, Where heavenly feelings stir within the heart. It is no place, no time, no Afterlife, 'Tis now, 'tis here, it is all Time, all Place It is ourselves! yea! Paradise is but The small space bosomed in the heart of man, And Ether boundless, limitless as thought, Could not enlarge its sphere, no, no, not one Least Tittle! for where God is, there is all! WORLDGRATITUDE. When thou pluck'st down the apple from the tree, Thank'st thou the root which nourished it below? From thence, allviewless as it is, doth flow The sap which makes that fruit so sweet to thee. So in the State; the Blessings which may be In sight and reach of all men, which all know How to appreciate, these ever grow From causes which the vulgar neither see Nor thank: thence is it that the Godlike Soul Must toil with sad conviction that the Goal Reserves no Garland for his sublime head. Like God, tho' He gives motion to the whole He is unseen, unthought of, and when dead His empty name is worshipped in his stead! But to be thus like God, that sublime Thought; More than consoles for being held as nought By Men; and like a Halo on his Brow Reveals his coming Glory even now! LIFE. 1. Life in itself is nothing, save as we Make use of and enjoy it: 'tis a dream To many, they are not, but only seem; For that which we possess not consciously, We have not! think'st thou the Richman can be Truly possessor of the mighty stream Of wealth, which flows for him? his coffers teem With absent, useless Treasures: what can he Enjoy beyond that which He needs? His eyes Look coldly on the Pomp, wherein the Heart Finds nothing to awake its sympathies. The magiccircle where the wiseman's Art All happiness, aud Beauty can comprize, Is only of his Being here that Part Which in his spirit's Compass truly lies! 2. Life is but as the Good which we have done To others, as our feelings have been; which Are mines of endless wealth, to make us rich Tho'we have nought on Earth but these alone! They weave the Zone of Beauty which is thrown Round the whole world. Life, is as our thought, As we have held that Glass straight or distort. As other threads of Being with our own Have been inwoven: is, as far, as we Have made our dream of it Reality. As far, as with the moments speeding by, Like the waves of Eternity's vast sea, We have moved onward ever steadily, In Storm or Calm, from all Misgivings free! SUBMISSION TO PROVIDENCE. Use me, Oh! God, Oh use me, as may seem Best to thyself, that sublime Faith which fears Nought, And hopes all be mine, Then let my years Be numbered like the seasands, till no Beam Of this thy blessed Light upon me gleam, Till voice of Brook or Bird no more endears Life's few last Days, and all without appears A Blank; or let them fleet with youth's brief Dream; Only keep quick my Heart within my Breast And let the inner Light be dimmÃ«d ne'er. Deal with me, in thy Wisdom as seems Best. Let me be as a Vessel destined here To draw up from the well of Life, some blest Draughts of Truth's living waters, fresh and clear, That Men may drink them and get sight again. Then let the Vessel, this my poor Heart lie Shattered in Fragments with the stroke of Pain, By the Wellsbrink left there forgetfully. Thou canst raise up according to thy Need, Far nobler Means to quicken the good seed; Enough, if in Life's brief or lengthened Day, I have fulfilled its End as best I may, Mighty thro' thee, without whom Strength is vain: For all are strong who thy Commands obey! STRONGFEELING. 'Tis well on some one Point to feel both deep- -Ly And intensely â but take first good Heed What that point be. Strong Feeling is the Seed Of all true Action; if thy Feelings sleep, Then thou art as the Dead. Now wouldst thou reap A Harvest from thy Feelings rich indeed, Wouldst thou from all vain Hopes and Fears be freed, Which paralyze thine Action, and make steep And hard the Path of Virtue, then I say, Feel deeply, but upon Eternal Things Alone! then will thy Thoughts be like strong Wings To lift thee from this Earth â thus day by Day Wilt thou grow calm, for the Eternal brings With it still its own Changelessness; for aye To its own Nature turning all beneath its Sway! TRUE GREATNESS. I love to see the great man seated by His Fireside wilh children round his knee, Sharing their little sports and harmless Glee; No Ostentation in his speech or Eye, Hinself a Child too in Simplicity Of Heart, altho'a God in Mind He be! And most the last, when most the first! For He Whose wisdom puckers up his Brow, is nigh- -Er unto Folly than He thinks: it is A barren Lore whose Fruit is not of Bliss. I love to see the great Man great in Week- -Day Life's familiar Intercourse; 'tis this That makes him so; he waits not for the Call Of great Occasions, He is great in all. For wisdom knows no Littleness; with his Least Fellowcreature, as the greatest, meek And simple, sharing their least Joys and Fears, And Hopes, but still subliming these to high- -Er Ends; and hallowing the common Tears, And beating Heart of frail Humanity, By bright Prophetic Touches, from the years To come, and Glimpses of Eternity! SUNSETSCENE. Once more, Oh! once more, let me fill mine Eyes, My Heart and Soul, with all I gaze upon. One Moment and the vision will be gone; The gorgeous Pageantry swept from the skies, As wantonly, as tho'but to surprize Us with her Wonderworks thus briefly shown, Then snatched away, were Nature's aim alone. No tokens will be left, save those which rise Before the dreamy Sight of Memory: As noiselessly as Thought all melts away; Night draws her Curtain, and the Landscapes die. This glorious Poem of another Day, In which my Soul's a Hymn, fades off for aye This silent Harmony, this music for the Eye! ON OVERSCRUPULOUS VIRTUE. She is a Sinner, and thou turn'st as tho' Thou wert an Angel in thy Purity; Yet wherefore has God given thee an Eye To see, an Heart to feel, save it be to Work all the Good, which thou hast Power to do? And tho' she be so! art thou then so high, That thou canst not stoop down to her? then why Did God send his own Son to us? are you Higher than God, or purer than the son? Shame on ye! in the Sight of God, None, none Are vile; none, none contemptible, nor e'er By Mercy thrust aside! He, who alone Is himself nought but Purity, his Ear Shuts not, not e'en to Her; nay He will hear With far more Joy than when the Angels hymn His Praise, that lost sheep praying unto Him, Â«Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name,Â» have mercy, thou who read'st the Heart, Who know'st the Burthen it has had to bear, For these, these but the sin alone can see And know not what the strong Temptations were. Shame on thee! art thou more than God, or art Thou less than Man? Yea! verily, I say, Thy Sin is more than Hers a thousandfold, For in God's sight, who is all Love, a cold Hard Heart is of all sins the greatest; yea! 'Twere easier to make the waters flow From the hard Flint, than Good from such a Breast! Her Sin is nobler than thy virtue â aye, A thousand times; for haply it doth owe To that, which of all virtues is the best, To Love, its origin â for there is no, No virtue without Love; of all the Rest, It is the End and the Beginning, the Completion, and the crowning Grace; and tho' She be a Sinner! Wherefore should she be So, longer than there is necessity? Has she not still a Heart? must one Illdeed Of neverfailing Evil sow the seed? Beause ye do not, or ye will not know, That Man is no machine to work out ill, Which having done so once, must do so still! And who compels her to remain so? ye, Ye, ye, ye Hypocrites with puckered Brow And lip of scorn, ye thrust her down to Hell, And laugh like Demons o'er an Angel's Fall, When she should sit in Glory' bove ye all! She had a Soul of Good still in Her; Woe, Then woe to ye, who suffer Her to dwell In Sin, when ye might save! God will require Her at your Hands, and great will be his Ire, For this one, one lost soul: far better 'twere That to your necks a Millstone had been tied, And ye been cast into the deep sea, there To perish, ere ye hardened thus your Hearts from Pride! BLESSINGS. No Blessings can be earned in this Life, till Thou hast prepared thyself for them â hast brought Thy Mind into a fitting Mood. For nought Divine can be attained, till Heart and Will Are purified â the inward Fount whence still All Good must flow. Life's coarsest Stuff is wrought To pure Etherial Forms, by thy own Thought, When schooled its sublime Duty to fulfill. Our Thoughts are our best Blessings â these alone Deserve the Name â all others are but Dross, Where these are not-and where these are, the Loss Of those, unfelt: the Treasure is thine own Already, which thou sought'st without; it lies Within thee; think but so, and it is won. Make thyself worthy of it first, (for none Who earn not, gain the Treasures of the Skies), And then thou needst not seek for it, 'tis thine! Live pure then, as an Angel! be divine, Be Godlike, yea! for such thou art, and then Thou wilt become an Angel â wilt possess In thine own Bosom, every Blessing, when Thou hast thereof but a due Consciousness! And to this End, ask nought of Heaven, but take Whate'er it sends, in calm Contentedness; For such a Temper Good of all can make, Till Life's worst Ills departing, turn and bless Thy Threshhold, changed to Angels for thy sake! ALL THINGS A HYMN TO GOD. Hear'st thou the Hymn? from star to star it flows, Like the deep sound of many waters; on, For ever on, thro' boundless space â not one Sole Thing, but duly pays the Debt it owes Of Praise, according to its kind! the Rose- -E's Scent and Beauty are its hymn! the sun With each Daysdawn, and when his Course is run, Sets forth with colours fairer far than those Of Raphael, on the Clouds that bar his way, His Maker's Glory, And as from the Sky They melt, with silent Language for the Eye, They hymn his Praise! â And thou, my Soul, too play Thy Part; and under his Name modestly Work out the Godlike, like the Stars, nor pray For vain reward or Recompense, for by Becoming Godlike will thou best repay At once thyself, and serve the Deity! The Rose is quite a Rose, and what that can Accomplish, canst not thou? be quite a Man! Then will thy Being, like the Rose's, be A Hymn, and Godlike wilt thou live and die; Fit, like its Scent, to mix with Ether, free As Angels, yea! an Angel verily! TRUE LIFEDEVELOPING. Friend, think not that a mighty Actionsphere Is needful to unfold the soul within thee! If thou wert Alexander with the World Before thee, or Napoleon, thou wert Not more a Man, no, not one tittle; nay, The rather dispossessed of thy true Self! For then thou wert the creature of a Dream, Holding a Shadowsceptre, ruling o'er Vain forms, as fleeting e'en as those left by Thy passing shape upon the ground, and more Unreal than such as haunt the sleeper's brain. For when thou stand'st before the Judgmentseat, Wilt thou stalk on a mighty crowned Ghost, And to the assembled Angels, shouting cry, Â«Lo, I am AlexanderÂ», what thinkst thou Of Alexander overpassed the Grave? Himself my friend, the man, the simple man, Unbuskin'd and unstilted from the Stage Whereon he played his Drama, full of sound And idle uproar; Oh! believe me, friend, If thou wouldst be thyself, wouldst be a man, Live thine own Life; live for thyself, yet still In others; live thou like the violet, With all thy dear ones, like a Knot of true And faithful hearts, that in each other pour Their fragrance, so that one is sweet as all; So that the Life of one be that of all; And as the violet has many flowers, But growing from one root, and as the Dew That falls on one refre shes all, the blow Which wounds one woundeth all, so shall it be With you and yours; the Life of man is not In outward things, 'tis in his inner self, And that which he there gains is gained for ever! And when He feels the Consciousness of Self, Then is he himself, then, but not till then! ON INJURYBEARING. If a man injures thee: of thy Goodname Would rob thee: with Unthankfullness repay Thy Goodwill, and Gooddeeds, do not I pray Indulge in Hate and Anger â 'twere a shame To fret at such a Cause â think that the same, The Good God up in Heaven suffers! yea! How many give him Ill for Good, and say Harsh Things of Him, emboldened oft to blame By his so long Forbearance! Would'st thou then Other Example than thy God? Know too That none can injure thee so much, so true- -Ly as thyself! and this thou dost most, when Thro' Hate and Anger at thy Fellowmen, Thou troublest thy own Soul, the One Good thro' Which all the rest becomes so unto you! ON USING IMAGINATION. Thy Fancy was not given thee for nought, Then sway it kinglike: 'tis a Magicwand And even Spirits wait at its Command, At least thy own Thoughts, in which must be sought All Blessings really durable! a Thought Can make the Beggar rich, place in his Hand The sceptre of an Empire never spanned By Heavenarching Iris; then be taught To use it well and often; e'en in this Dull Weekday Life, for that its best Sphere is. Keep it not for Life's grand Solemnities, Nor mouth it but in Poet's-Rhapsodies, And dull dead Books, else thou its End wilt miss. Draw thy Life's Poetry from it, for his Imagination profits him alone, Who beautifies its harsh Realities With Hues as fresh as Raphael breathed on His bright Â«TransfigurationÂ»; 'tis all one If in the Objet itself, or thine Eyes, The Beauty dwell: enough if felt by thee! This is Imagination's End, to see All Things as if transfigured by its own Celestial Light, Ã©en Pain and Misery! And know, that of the daily Bread of Bliss, Tho' the main substance by the Heart must be Supplied, yet still a little Fancy is No unfit Leaven; this will set it free From what of Earthly round the Heart has grown, And make it Food for Angels; e'en Love's kiss Without a Touch of Fancy were Halfjoy, This hallows it, and then it cannot cloy! POVERTY, WHAT REALLY. What Constitutes the Force of Poverty? The many wants which it cannot appease. Now, tho' the Richman satisfies with Ease His Wishes, yet not being sobered by The chastening Power of necessity, And not real wants, they quickly cease to please, And wilder wishes follow â thus thro' these Many new Wants, 'mid all his Luxury, Is He still poor; nay, poorer than the man, Who having but few Wants, with Little can Be rich and happy: and the Richman too Is more the Slave of Circumstances, than The Poorman, 'spite of all his wealth, nay, thro' That very Wealth. Like a Slave, owing to Others his Happiness â that Beggar is Truliest so, who begs his daily Bliss, And not his daily Bread. Thus Poverty Is not the having little wealth, for by Gold, none was e'er made happy; but 'tis this: To have too many wants, and thus to miss Thro' the superfluous the necessary! EVIL OF SUSPICIONS. Oft, oft have I been cheated â often too Repaid with Injuries for Good â yet still I trust my Fellows nottheless, untill Deceived again, thus ever will I do. Of those chief Goods of Soul, the being true To onesownself, the Singleness of Will And Heart, the living ever as if Ill Were not in this fair world, thus keeping new The unsuspecting Heart of Infancy, The open Brow, fresh Feelings and clear Eye, The Maintenance of these I say, is worth In my Esteem, all, all the Gold of Earth! And for what should we make a Sacrifice, If not for our own Â«SoulsÂ»? He, He is wise Alone, who deems all Loss as nought to this, For where the Soul is Godlike, no Loss is! But to live in Suspicions vile and low, This is to soil the Soul till no more so. And to suspect all men, is to degrade Mankind, and thyself with it! to which no, No Ill should e'er a noble mind persuade! TRUE MIGHT. There is a might in gentleness, a power That owns no ruder symbol than a look Or softbreathed word, and yet our souls are shook Thereat, far more than is the lightest flower By the stormblast; to whom yields Earth her dower Of Beauty? to the crashing winds that brook No gentle voice of bird or running brook, Or to the springbreath which, in one brief hour, Unfolds a thousand shapes of Loveliness? E'en so it is! still Violence and strife Can perfect nought for human happiness! They do but reach the outward forms of life Which, like themselves, are dust and nothingness; Th' Enduring Mighty they nor know nor give. MONEYTHIRST. Laugh on and sneer, ye moneymaking Crew, Ye who, than wealth, no worthier aims can see, Sweeter than gold are my daydreams to me Tho' empty pursed, yet richer far than you, Who have no use of yours; Oh! tell me, who Deserves by wisdom to be callÃ«d free That unto Mammon sells his Liberty? He who for this vile yellow dust would do A meansouled action is a slave indeed. And who to its possession would assign Of degradation the cheappurchased meed, Deserves to taste of nothing more divine Than Gold can buy, and in his hour of pain To find it turn to what it is again, To Common Dust, like that on which we tread! FREEDOM. Think ye that forms of Government alone Or idle names can make men truly free? Ye may be slaves in a Democracy, And freemen 'neath a Despot! 'tis all one, For if the outward form be not bas'd on Virtue, and Truth, and Justice, it can be Quickened by no true soul of Good â think ye That Freedom's holy light hath ever shone On brows bent down for Mammon's yellow dust? Think ye they ever breathed her Ether, who No holy aspirations ever knew, Whose thoughts like Earth are Earthy, and whose trust Is placed in fleeting things, that to the heart Their own unrest and baselessness impart? VILLAGEBELLS. 1. Music! what music is there 'neath the sun Can match with your wild notes, ye Villagebells? What themes are yours! there's not a heart that swells 'Neath mortal breast, but lingers to your tone As to a spirit's voice; have we not grown Heart, ear, hope, memory, amid the spells Which ye have wound around us? aye, youth tells In you his merry tale of days bygone! Oh! when on some calm summer's-eve we hear, (When thoughts are voices from the past,) the song Of some sweet bird, whose tone has changed ne'er, Tho' our's be not as once; and when along With the still streamlet's voice the nightwinds bear Those bells, they wake the Past's wild spectrethrong, 2. Looks from deathsealÃ«d eyes our own Eyes greet, And hearts are throbbing on our heart, which now, 'Mid their own bosom's-dust, lie cold and low In the Churchyard, and voices sounding sweet From household-lips, whose kiss may never meet Our lips again. Oh! God, 'tis even so, A few strokes on a bell, the careless blow Of some rude hand, wake echoes which as fleet As thought, the heart gives back and stir its strings To agony or bliss; we are not what we seem, The Past is not all Past! its buried things Are with us still, unseen as is the beam Of the nightshrowded Sun, who warmth still flings On Earth, thus Past things are not all a Dream! 3. How many voices have ye, ye Churchbells? No ear has heard them all, except it be For others, not for self; a mystery Wraps up some tones, they sleep like magic spells Within, till changeful Time the moment tells, And at his call they start to life, in glee Or grief; two tones ye have of potency To stir the founts that feed the spirit's wells Of deepest thought â two solemn tones, I ween, That mark life's first and last, the mystic bier, The portal to a land no eye hath seen; The smileclad cradle, where a mother's tear Of joy is dropt; thricehappy, if she ne'er Live to repent that name had ever been! 4. Yet have ye other tones, and many too, Each in its proper key, rich minstrelsy As varied as the Interludes, which be In life's eventfull drama: some of woe, And some of joy; full many a tale ye know To tell, with more than poet's mastery; Best preachers are ye when a grave is nigh, Merry Inviters to a city-show, Or marriagefeast; but thrilling Tones ye fling For fire and war, sleepfrighting Terrorspells! Yet fearfuller your forced mirth, when ye ring A tyrant to his throne, a nation sorrowing! All these tones have ye, all your own, ye bells, But in the heart your music's spirit dwells. 5. What mystic voices from its depths reply, Like thunderechoes 'mid the hills, the heart Hath many things we know not of, till art Or chance has called them forth â but many die, Unbosomed and selfsepulchred; no eye Of mortal ken may fathom it; each part Of nature teems with shapes and sounds that start To life beneath the spirit's impulse high. The shows of outward things are subject to Its bidding, and the yearning heart will bind Its rich associations to the hue Of forest, field, and flower, till it find Emblems in all things, seeking to renew The unity of Nature and mansmind! SEEMINGPOOR. Why poor? tho' coarselyclothed his body be, His food the commonest that Earth supplies, Yet scanty as it is, his Luxuries Are neither few nor small â content is He, Therefore he has an ample sovereignty; He is a true philosopher, and wise In that profoundest of all mysteries, In selfenjoyment: in his thought he's free, As a bird i'the air, from life's vain woes. Looking on earthly gains as passing shows, He hath a quiet smile for such as mourn For pleasures which, at latest, at life's close Must be resign'd â he seeks a higher bourne, Nor unprovided on his journey goes! He has sought nothing but himself, thus he Cannot lose what he is, for that he still must be! SUNSETTHOUGHT. What is it, that mine Eyes look on? some bright And radiant Angel, from the Settingsun Alighting on yon Hill? no, 'tis but one Of Earth's poor Dwellers, whom the Heaven's light Has steeped in its own Glory, till to Sight He seems transfigured: but the Glory's gone, And there He stands, a simple Man alone, The Halo faded from his Brow: Like might, Yea! more hath virtue! She can lasting make That Glory; can transfigure inwardly The Mortal, till the Angel's Form he take, And be, not seem â till ever in God's Eye, From his whole being its clear Light will break Transparent made, like moses' Bush, thereby! OVERSHARPSIGHTEDNESS. Oh! woe unto the man whose keener eye Hath looked too deep beueath the surface; who Will not take forms for things, nor false for true, Nor ape and farce it, like the rest, nor buy By Idolworship like security From persecution; he will live to rue That he had eyes among the blind, and knew Too much to be a Dupe; what misery Can equal that man's, who finds nothing here To fill his heart? Who yearns for something more Than this Life offers; to his eyes, the clear And blessed forms of nature's self seem sear; He seeks but cannot find the golden Lore, The Alchymy, Life's lost charm to restore! SECONDTHOUGHTS ON THE ABOVE Pardon, great God! most idly was it said; 'Twas in a fit of Sadness, And mine Eye Was filmed; but now the dark Cloud has pass'd by Earth laughs before my Feet, and Heaven is spread, In all its Boundlessness, above my Head, And 'neath the bright blue dome, I kneel for thy Forgiveness, for the Thought was Blasphemy. But now, like yon dim Cloudlet, it has fled, And left me, like the Heavens, full of Light, Thy Light, and by it I again see right. And could I say, Â«that there was nothing here To fill the HeartÂ», when even now the Tear From thoughts unutterable, dims my Sight; When it is so, so full, that but to hear The Bird's least note makes it gush over quite! And canst thou not vain Mortal find out Ã¡nght To fill thy Heart? is it so great then, so Capacious, that the Godliest Feeling, tho' Love itself, is but as a Drop, as nought Therein? Can that which fills God's own Heart, yea! To overflowing, not fill thine, I say? Is not the Rosebud full of its own Scent? Is not the Vine with its own Clusters bent? And canst thou then not fill thy Human Heart With human Feeling? then, I say, thou art Not yet a Man! And can the Godlike, can The thought of God, whose overflowing Love Stoops from emblazoning the clouds above, To streak the Dayseye with the selfsame Hue That crimsons them, not fill the Heart of Man? Oh Fool! then for the Flower one Drop of Dew Does more than what the Godlike does for you, Which is thy Being! And if this Life gives Full Scope unto the Godlike, Fair and True, What matters it then where or how one lives, More than to live Godlike, can no one do! TIME. E'en as the Bee has Honey and a sting, So has each Moment; take thou then good heed, To lay that up against thine hour of need, And to avoid the other: if a thing Tempt thee, first ask thyself if it will bring Pleasure, but in the Present; Joy indeed, When worthy of the name, doth ever breed After its kind, the one, still ministring Unto the other; and the more they be Divine the richer is their progeny; But earthly joys are barven, and they die Issueless; for if they at will could be Renewed, then Virtue were a mockery, Whose essence is more pure, the more from these set free! EVENINGTHOUGHT. Not one least Leaf is stirring in the Sky; Yon lazyflakÃ«d clouds hang stilly, where The wind has wafted them, as if the Air, With its last Breathings, faint and sleepily Had urged them thither â softlytingÃ«d by The sinking Sun, their Edges glow, and there Beneath, those Trees, which columnlike upbear Their lazy weight, are steeped so lovelily In purple, while the mists begin to rise Around their Stems, and quiet as a Dream, This soft work of Enchantment mirrored lies In the broad surface of yon' slumbering stream! No longer know I where I am, mine Eyes Reel with Delight; I myself feel and seem Dissolved into the Elements, a Beam Of purple Sunlight, blent with this fair Whole. Oh! that I might be ever thus; my soul Like yon calm Stream; the Mirror in my Breast Giving the Semblance of its inward Rest To all reflected in it, even to The troubled, and the fleeting Forms w'thout: Until this rude, hard world, there in its true Meaning reflected, should show fair as do The clouds and Landscape in this Water here! Which shows all as it is, and yet more clear, Soft, and transparent, with a Magic Hue Which its own Depth and chrystal Pureness gives! So too in thy Soul's Depth and Purity May be reflected truly all that lives, There, with its Moral joined to beautify, Like the Reflection of yon quiet Sky! And even then, when dark and troublous Forms Cast their deep Shadows on it, tho' they be Gloomy without, and there foretell of storms, Yet their Reflection, by the Light in thee Transparent made, enables thee to see Thro' them, the calm and cloudless Sky behind! And tho' the storm should burst without, that is No Reason, why it should disturb thy Bliss; Without it is a storm, but in in thy Mind, A calm Reflection only; and who e'er Was by a Picture really moved to Fear, OBSERVE ALL THINGS CAREFULLY. Tho' even not a Father, scorn not thou To look on the least child with serious eye; 'Tis only from a Child, that thoroughly Thou canst know what a child is. Books can show, At best, but false or feeble Copies; tho' The living specimen is ever nigh, Philosophers, just for this, pass it by, The sole source whence real knowledge e'er can flow. Be thou then not so foolish; keep thy mind, Thy heart and senses open â feel, live, see; Wouldst thou know what a Man is, thou must be Thyself a Man: each thing in its own kind, Is comprehended but by sympathy, And without this thou mightst as well be blind! BOOKS. Oh Books, if ye had but a heart to beat In unison with ours, then ye would Be to us an unmixed and perfect Good! And yet methinks'tis so, would we but see it In the true Light; else whence the sacred Heat, Which ye breathe into us, the lofty mood, The human yearnings strong, which send the Blood To the full Heart with Impulse deep and sweet? Oh yes, ye have a Heart; the Poet's Heart; Yea! and of that the very noblest Part, Freed from all mixture, from all drossy, low And worldly Feelings, in his verse doth glow; And if his Inspiration be the Smart, At Times, of its own agony, His woe Exalts and purifies, and can impart Like to the Crown of Thorns upon Christ's brow, A Glory to that agony, for He, Like Christ, too suffers for Humanity! And as the Spirit of the frozen wine Gathers unto the Centre, strong and clear, So in the Poet's Heart all that's Divine; The earthly Sorrow, and the mortal Fear, The Common, Vulgar, these are frozen, gone, The Man is lost, the Angel lives alone! ON A GRAVEBRINKSPORTING CHILD. 1. Seest thou yon Child, all life and joy, at play Upon that dark grave's brink? how heedlesly He sports, unknowing what it is to die! No fretting thoughts of what he is, or may Become, annoy his heart, yet in his way Fate's manymeshÃ«d net is spread, and nigh His young feet wander carelessly, as fly Young birds into the Fowler's toils: thus aye, The grave and cradle touch; mark how he plays With that grim, fleshless scull, as tho' it were Nought but a toy, no moral strange might bear To his young thought, and his small finger strays Along the eyeless socket where stern Care And Time, have quenched in dust the once bright rays; The Beam of Laughter, Love, perhaps Despair, Dwelt where the worm, vile Tenant! holds their Place! 2. Strange Contrast'twixt the grave and life; the first And last of all, that man may be or know, Till Death has lifted from the Future's Brow The aweful veil! untill he learn the worst, Or best, that unreached Bourne may bring, and burst, As from his Mother's womb, so from this low Dim, ignorant present, and immortal grow! The child sports on the brink, his balance lost, The crumbling earth falls in, and there he lies! E'en so! a little while, a few years run, And ring their changes in his heart and eyes, A few brief tears, a few false smiles quickflown, The birthday, mariage, deathbell, and all's done! And then above his grave some child shall play likewise! 3. And there they are together, those two strange, Wild mysteries of Life and Death! so wide Apart, and yet so near, that Fancy's Range Scarce dares to grasp what one brief moment's stride Can overstep, more easily than might A babe a wheelrut! see them, side by side, One coming whence we know not, Heavenslight Spent and relit by unseen power, within This frail Claylamp, changedim'd and soiled by sin! The other leading whither we know not, A narrow Gateway, yet where none need strain, Not e'en Napoleon, the Â«Great;Â» through which All, all must pass; kings, beggars, poor, and rich, Bare as they came, whose Toll is death's brief pain! Haply returning to the selfsame spot, From whence we came, thus both ends meet again! 4. Strange world of Contrasts, where opposed things, That seem the most removed, are frequent thrown In closest contact, and the change from one To other, is as quick, as tho' the wings Of some wild dream had brought them. Thus Time rings His mighty changes, moving sternly on While, to his music, Joy and Sorrow run Their mazy Rounds quick varying, as he flings His changeful notes; and Life and Death hardby Cross hands unconsciously: thus the same day, The beggar doffs his rags of misery, And the rich fool aside his pomp must lay; The grave, while marriagebells are ringing nigh, Is dug, and the two Trains oft jostle on the way! 5. Strange world! where oft, our glad smiles turn to tears, Ere they have flown the lip, as tho' they were Cameleonwise, one essence, and like air, Changed shape and hue each moment! Thus our fears And hopes reciprocate, thus stern Time wears The fretted heart, till its pulse'neath despair To agony is quickened â from past years Rise spectres, whose glance we can scarcely bear; Or fresh griefs open up each early wound, Ere they have time to close! alas! our life, Passes, like some strange dream, a constant strife, 'Twixt what we are and would be; while around We seek the flowers from which Joy fills his hive, Withered they fall, and nought but thorns are found! 6. Be wise, and pluck lifesflowers ere they fade, Thy youth's bright flowers, while the Heavendew, Time's first unsullied drops, the Leaves still strew, And with them weave a garland, which, when made Place on the altar of thy God, instead Of leaving them to wither, till each hue Of freshness fades â be wise! life's plant no new, Or sweeter can produce, till thou art dead, And from the dust thy gooddeeds blossom bright Unto eternal Spring; give not thy years, Thy fruitful years of youth unto the blight Of sinful revelry; but once it bears, And its firstfruits are holy in God's sight! Once lost, Time sends instead of dew, but barren tears. WISDOM Bow down thine Ear, and close it not in pride, But list in Humbleness, and thou shalt hear The Voice of Wisdom, whispering low but clear; Wisdom, who loves to walk still at the side Of Meekness, and of Innocence, doth hide Her ways from the proud Heart. Oh stoop thine Ear, For oft her Voice is then most surely near, When thou hast bent it lowest; oft 'twill glide Along the still Earth with the Cricket's cry, Sublime beneath thy feet, as up on high Amid the hymning spheres! and if thy Soul Hath aught Divine in it, or profit by Her Lessons, then wilt thou strive towards Life's Goal Without one Touch of idle Vanity; Content to feel thyself one with this Whole, This lovely Whole! ascribing nought to thy Sole self, but like the flowers, modestly, All, all to him who doth all things control. AGAINST PRIDE: ADDRESSED TO THE SPIRIT OF HUMANITY. 1. The meanest Duty which falls to the share Of Humannature hath a value, high- -Er than the lofliest even; for thereby We tame its worst vice, Pride! And tho' it were To wash the poorman's feet, or help to bear The Load he groans beneath. Nor think that thy Proud Station loses aught of Dignity, By stooping to the Beggar. Is the air He breathes of, different, or does the sun Then grudge him Light and warmth if thou art near? Or beats his Heart less nobly because on His Breast but dirty rags, and scant, appear? Tho' thou should'st come down to him from a Throne, Thou wouldst not stoop, his Master is thine own! 2. Tho' stilted up beyond Pride's boldest thought, Thou still could'st be not one, one Tittle more Than Man; And tho' thou shouldst descend e'en lower Than the Daylabourer, thou needst be nought That's less than Man! true Greatness then is wrought Out in these Limits, which stand fixed before The Eye of Wisdom, not to be passed o'er By him, who in Life's Godlike Race has sought The genuine Goal, begining where he should! For 'twixt the Cradle and the Grave, the space Is ample for the most ambitious Mood; Far nobler conquests than a Cesar could Accomplish, may the meanest beggar grace, And on his Brow a Crown of Glory place! 3. For in the Service of Humanity The lowliest Labourer is worth his hire; It is a Field that yields ungrudgingly Far more than what we ask for or require; The meanest sickle reaps a Harvest worth The wealth of Crowns, for there is never Dearth. The Godlike Birthright of Humanity To be a Man, is never lost, save by And thro' ourselves; so long as on this Earth We walk in Innocence, and still are men, So long all, all are holy in Godssight, All Godlike, and the lowliest most so! then With thy whole Heart, and Soul fulfill aright Thy sublime Mission; in thyself revere The Spirit of Humanity; in all That lives and breathes, with holy awe, and Fear Of doing aught unworthy of the name Of Man, which thou a common Good dost share, Dear in itself, and for their sakes, who bear It with thee; and unto the slightest call Of that great Spirit, lend not a deaf Ear. For oh 'twere bitter sorrow and deep shame, If thou should'st not pass even thro' the Flame, Tho' but in a Babeseye to dry the Tear! How much more when man's Godliest Heritage, Faith, Love, Truth, Freedom, are at stake, soiled by The Pander's Hands, or threatened by the Rage Of vile Apostates from man's Dignity! Then strive to be all that thou canst on Earth, Fulfill the End and object of thy Birth. Strive to be quite a Man, for being so, Whatever Fortune makes thee else, thy worth Is still the same; King, Cobbler, there is no, No difference, save in Names; for none are great, Or small but all Freemen, in God's own State! And where the lowliest is highest, how In such a State, can there be high or low? Now art thou answered; go and learn to live! Thine Overwealth to the next Beggar give, For the sun throws no more Light on thy Pride, Than on the Pallet where lank Want doth hide His nakedness: go, do now all you can, Go profit by my words, and be a Man. TO MILTON. Milton! my lip is hallowed by thy name, And my heart beats with silent gratitude, Yet not allwordless, tho' its voice be crude And harsh, for such a theme: what was true fame I asked, and whence the glory of a Name, And many a darkling oracle upstood, Pointing to deeds of folly and of blood, From which the heart recoils in grief and shame. I turned from these blind leaders of the blind To thee, and thou from out thy Gloriescloud, On the Eternal mount of Truth, enshrined, Didst speak, and Heaven seemed to voice aroud Its high behest, and say; seek, and thou'lt find, Fame dwells with Truth and Time, not with the fickle crowd! TO VENICE. 1. Venice thou art a city of the dead, And the dark shadow of Antiquity Still mantles, like a pall, thy stately, high, Yet timeworn palaces: have I not read Thy glory, in old times, but now instead How do I see thee! oh! it makes me sigh, To think from what a height, how low doth lie Thy name! was it for this thy children bled In Europe's struggle with the Othman foe? For this thy spirit patient, subtle, free, Bound with the magic chain of mind, the low And baffled enmity of Force, to be A trampled and degraded thing? e'en so! Thou art no more fit mate for Adria's changeless sea! 2. The waves that break upon the Lido's bank Waft not thy fleets in triumph from the main, Rich with the spoils of nations! ne'er again Shall it be thine, to reassert thy Rank Foremost among the first: thy glory sank, Like a bright vision, from the eyes of men, And its place knows it not! fond hope in vain Would recreate the past; the cup is drank, Drained to the dregs of woe; and in thy halls The rank grass mocks the crumbling pride of yore, And haggard Desolation sits, and calls With hollow voice, from out the city's core! Oh 'tis a sad, sad sound, and on me falls Like a departing wail for times no more! 3. I've stood on the Rialto's arch by night, And seen the Gondolas quick darting glide, Like sprites, along the Palaceglassing Tide, And Venice seemed to rise upon my sight, Once more from out the deep, from whence the might Of mind had called her, and in lonely pride Bade her amid the eternal waves abide, And be as everlasting! but her light Is faint among the Nations! Yet still flow Those waves, as they were wont, and still shall flow, When nought of Venice lives to greet the sun! That which is born of Time, Time must lay low Sooner or later; Giantworth alone Endures, when cities are but crumbling stone! 4. E'en so fair Venice shall it be with thee! The topless Tower, the Dome, the pillar'd Hall, Shall sink into their native dust, and all That Pride had piled, as if in Mockery, To emblem thus his nothingness, must lie Scattered and strewn, with scarce a stone to call To mind, the Â«Queen of waters!Â» yet she shall Still rule men's minds, when palpable Powers fail, A nobler Empire far! these shall she sway, With these build up a more enduring Home Than that of Stone; and Gratitude shall lay A wreath of Evergreens upon her Tomb. For of such Deeds as Hers, tho' passed away, The Spirit lives, a Heritage for Aye! LAWS. Yes! Ye may fence with sharp and thorny Laws Your o'ergrown wealth, and scare off the poor man From your Domains, and shut him in the span Of life's dull, dusty Highway; but some Flaws Nature finds in your Titledeeds! She was, And is, impartial, as when she began, And lets none violate her mighty Plan Unpunished: and mark how she does it; Laws May guard your wealth, tho' scarcely: something more, Yea! Something more is needful to make ye Real Masters of your own â a higher power Must give the godlike Privilege to be; To feel, as well as call it yours! the Flower, Wherever Sun and Wind are grows â so free, On all, doth Nature her chief Blessings shower! And the poor Beggar whom his grudged Path o'er Your wide Park leads, beneath the old Oaktree, Throws off his wallet and for half an hour, Munching his hard Bread, sweetened by the Glee Of God's bless'd Creatures in fresh Grass and Bower, Is Lord of all that ye call your's, for he Hath other titledeeds whereby to take Possession, such as Nature owns, a Breast To feel and love, of all her Gifts the best, A Heart by its own beatings kept awake! ON NAPOLEON. What tho' the stream of wisdom flows on slow Thro' Error's quicksands, lost to casual Sight, Yet shall it join at length with swelling might The open sea of Truth: true fame doth grow Not from the seed that in war's fields we sow, Polluted with man's gore, which on the bright And dazzling day of triomph, sheds a Blight; Shadows of Ill forecast! for human woe Mingles with that false brightness, and the blood Shed thus unholily, shall rise to curse The selfishness of cold ambition's mood. Tis with the milk of Human Love we nurse True fame, on contemplation's sober food, Peace, Charity, the Fear of God, and Brotherhood! AN EVENINGSTORM. 1. How murky grow the heavens, as in pain They laboured with some monsterbirth â The Heat Is close and suffocating, as when meet Contending passions in man's Breast, that strain The gasping Heart. Some heavy drops of rain, Wrung out from Nature's agony, the sweat Of pent up throes, splash sullen down; no sweet And fresh' ning tears, that ease the air again, But scant, hot, feverish, even such as fall From the o'erbrimming cup of misery, Yet leave it full: while thro' the lurid pall That shrouds all Heaven, the lightning flashes by, Revealing hate, but wrapped in mystery, And the hoarse thunders to the Onset call! 2. Meanwhile th expectant Earth, with troubled brow, Lies stirless, moveless as a living thing, That holds its breath in dread, yet cannot bring The throbbing heart to order: no winds blow, And yet each blade, each leaf with quivering throe, Forefeels the storm, and hark! on wide spread Wing Of flashing wrath, the thunderclouds now fling Their pent up fury, and the earth below, Reels like a stranded ship beneath the blow, While through the fervid air fierce echoes ring Rending the womb of night, and the winds wake As from a sleep of death, to desolate With tenfold fury; like man's Hate, to make A wider desolation, sure tho' late! But now the Tempesttracks of cloud and rain, Rifted and riven, float along the sky, Like a vast wreck, in shattered pageantry; And the far Thundergrowls roll off again Like sated beasts of Prey, that not in vain Have plyed their task, and in low murmurs die The winds, like froward children, wearied by The Fret and Vehemence of passing Pain. HOW TO ENJOY THE WHOLE. If thou art all that God can be in Man, Then thou art what the whole must be in one, Then feel it so, for in thyself alone Canst thou enjoy the wholeâ the widest span Of outward Power, yields thee far less than Thy least Thought, and till o'er these thou hast won Dominion, over outward Things is none! And having once acquired this, what can Mere outward Things add to thee? this great whole, Thou canst enjoy, if thou enjoyst thy Soul! For is not God the whole? and dwells not He Eternally, as thy ownself, in thee? Then feel and be thyself, thus will thy Mind All other Goods summed in its ownself find; Whereas the highest outward Blessing is Still but a Part, and the least Part of this, This inward Good, whichâ thou thyself must be! WESTMINSTERABBEY. 1. How small a space suffices for the pride, Whose Giantgrasp embraced all Earth and Sky In its bold aspirations â here they lie, The grand results of ages; side by side, The mighty ones of yore in peace reside, Severed in life by many a Century; As if, when these, her chosen spirits die, Nature reposed exhausted â here a bide The Eartho'ershadowing names, whose glory spread, Like a widebranching tree, from East to West, Neath which the nations sat! the mighty dead, Whose names evoke the Past; at whose behest The veil of ages is withdrawn! we tread As in another world, and fear to break its rest! 2. The Echoes of our footsteps strike the ear, Like Mystic Voices from the Past, and sweep As towards Eternity untill they sleep 'Mid the tall Roof's far Depths; for here The Present is not; Past and Future bear Our thoughts from all that speaks of Earth; we leap The life to come â Cross at one step the deep, Wide Gulf, which separates our narrow sphere From that enlarged Existence, as if we Were mingled with the mighty whole, whereto The Spirit shall return, when once more free, Absorbed as raindrops by the ocean! So Amid this thoughtrich pile that speaks of thee, Almighty God! Ages, like passing Shadows, show! THE ALLHALLOWING POWER OF THE HEART. How the Heart beautifies the smallest thing That feels its influence, and o'er it throws Hues, still by time untouched! this withered Rose, Long Stranger to the Dew's soft visiting; No more an Emblem of the scented Spring, But a sad Proof how soon Joy comes and goes; This Type of very Bliss, might now lie close To Time's own Hourglass, and add a Sting Unto his moral! Yet to me'tis dear, So dear, that tho' nought-worth in other Eyes, I would not for the fairest Flower that e'er The Dew lay on, exchange it-laugh not, wise Philosopher, with puckered Brow, and Sneer Of Selfsuperiority, at youth Who plucks the Rose, and likening the Prize To the fair Maiden's cheek he loves so true, Places it in her Bosom, and when sear It still seems so, so fairylovely to His Sight, for on the Breast, where now it lies, It drew the Perfume of the Heart, by which Its faded Leaves in Love's immortal dies Were steeped, and therefore is its odour rich, As when himself still pure, he thought all too Was Godlike, and not doubting of its Truth, Grew that which he believed! And when the years Have wrinkled that young Brow, and like the Rose, No trace of its first Loveliness appears, Still o'er her Form a holy Atmosphere Of Beauty, his Heart throws; and She, the Flower, Seem still the same he gazed on at that Hour! Yea! gazing steadily into that Face, O'er which the Touch of Sorrow and the Trace Of mortal change, have passed, he sees alone An Angel, and to him she still is one! Oh wise Man! wise Man! there is Wisdom, Yea! Which enters not into thy narrow Brain; A Wisdom, which with its calm divine ray, Gives back their Springtide Loveliness again To all Life's Forms; and as beneath the Play Of purple Sunlight, in the common way, The coarse Dust gleams like Jewels, so this can Make all things lovely for the eyes of Man, However mean and common it appears! Then kneel, and weep, yea! weep thou bitter Tears, If thou hast never felt, or been as he! Weep bitter Tears, yea! bitterer still, if thou Hast been so, and art so, so changÃ«d now, As not to feel thine Heart rejoice in thee At that which is so lovely in itself! Weep Tears, they are the most acceptable Of Offerings to God; for they can tell Alone, how deep is this thy misery. Weep, for thy Lot is worthyer of Tears Than if thou wert a Cripple without use Of Limb and Sense, for thy Heart doth refuse A Tear unto thine Eye! Paralysis Hath struck it, and as cold as Ice it is! O God, I pity thee; first, that no more Thou canst pluck that so fair, fair Rose, and laste A divine joy, in placing it before Thy dear one's breast, with thoughts as pure and chaste, As those of the just now unfolding Flower! For if itself thinks not, it is a thought Of him who made it, and by it is taught, The Good, the Beautiful, and True, as well As by the Lips of Wisdom her own Self! And secondly, oh thou whom Gold and Pelf, And the World's Glitter, can alone impel, I pity thee, that thou do'st not yet know Thy misery, but gloryest in thy woe: The Curse to be imaginationless, And never once in raptured thought to press Thy dear one's Lips again, though long, long gone, And feel the yearning Heart beat back thine own! Oh! better far it were that thou shouldst stand By the Roadside and stretch thy skinny Hand For Bread, than wear a smile of Mockery, At that which should bring Tears into thine Eye! CHURCHYARDTHOUGHTS. 'Tis twilight; not a sound stirs on the air, Save the scarcebreathÃ«d nightwind; the mindseye As fades the outward Scene, rapt inwardly, Feeds on strange fancies, 'mid these graves, which are The meetingplace of Generations, where Dust communes with past Dust â Friend, Enemy, Rich, Poor, Son, Father, Kindred, mingled lie, An undistinguished throng! years pass, and wear Away the earth that severs grave from grave, And dust must mix tho' twere of deadliest foes! The grave knows no distinctions, it will close Alike o'er kings and beggars, and nought save The costlier Tomb that to the gazer shows Its gilded Lie, nought marks the Tyrant from the Slave! TO DANTE. Dante! methinks on thy so thoughtworn face, Thy haggard eye, and wrinklefurrowed Brow, The Shadow of the Past, an inward woe, Tho' held aloof by pride, in each worn trace Still lingers: 'tis in vain we would efface From the frail flesh the spirit's burning glow Of thought and passion â Still the features show The Soul's deep workings â tho' the thankless Race, That cast thee forth from out its serpentbreast, Could not degrade; yet still, the vilest thing At times can sting the noblest, and the test To which thy fate subjected thee, could wring E'en from thy lips Allusive to Dante's worlds, Â«come sa di Sale il Pane altruiÂ», when reduced to want and misery: See Dante, Purgatorio XI Canto V. 138. where Oderisi prophecies to Dante his coming woes. the bitter thoughts that wrest The spirit from its pride, and bow to Earth its wing! CHILDREN. â Oh let them be with me, sweet Innocents! Their laughing eyes and gladtoned voices are Like glimpses of the bright blue heavens thro' The clouds that darken o'er this mortal scene. Oh! be assured that he who can look on Their harmless merriment with unmoved Eye, And stirless Heart, is not as he should be. The World is too much with him, and his Soul Has drunk Contamination; he is one Whose heart is out of tune for memories Of his own childish days â his mother's kiss Is no more as a hallowed thing, that on His lip has left a sweetness; he to words Of worldly meaning has profaned his tongue, And his Heart's first and pure imaginings Are powerless to bless! Oh! let him turn In humbleness of heart, and pray to be E'en as a little child, for he has not That perfect Love, that Unity of will, That world within himself, wherein the child Reigns all supreme, and sees before his feet All that his young heart covets â he has not Preserved unto the man, those qualities Which angels share with children; without which' We may not be accepted â let them come, Let me grow young in their young merriment, And be as one of them; oh! that I could See with their eyes, and feel with their young hearts, Blest in the present moment's happiness, As the Bird in his song, amid the leaves So green, with flowers and all sweetest things To bear him company, and list his mirth. Thrice blessÃ«d days! tho' past, ye're not all gone; I feel ye at my heartâ I thank thee, God! For tho' my spring of life be passed away, Yet has the seed sown in youth's fruitful soil By Nature's liberal hand, not perished all In the world's stony places, where so oft, Our young affections dwarf to barren weeds, And bear no Afterfruit. I thank thee, God! For I have still youth's ardent eye, that looks Abroad in Love to all things, and in all Findeth a beauty and a blessing; tho' My gush of admiration be less wild, 'Tis deeper in its calm Intensity, And like a sea, when swelling with the Tide, Allimperceptible, yet not less sure, With no unsanctioned tumult, no brief burst Of feverish sentiment, but strong and sweet, It fills all parts of Being with new life. I thank thee for the ear that still can find An unbought music 'mid the choral groves; No playhousestrains, or wanton minstrelsy Of Lydian airs that steal the soul away, And wake the baser Elements of sense, But true heartmusic, sung but by the pure, And for the pure, the merry woodbirds, who Sing not for praise or guerdon, but for love, And from the fulness of the heart; who ask No audience, but on their own deep joy Intent, care not who listens to their strain, Which is a Hymn to Thee, although thy Name Be heard not; for its Blessedness, that is The best Thanksgiving, better than all Words, For that which is quite blessed, is full of Thee! I thank thee, God! for never do I walk Abroad on this fair Earth, and not find peace; All that I see is mine; with liberal eye And heart I taste of all that Nature gives, And who shall say me nay? there is no power Whose tyranny extends thus far! no law That binds the soul! who will, may still be free, And Lord of all of Beautiful and Bright, That Earth, Air, Sea, can offer; so he be Not selfdebased: for Nature's glorious Lore Is not for him whose lip has touched the cup Of Sinabominations; this fair world To him is but a Chanceassemblage; hues, And sights, and sounds, and forms, wherein he sees No Harmony, Proportion, Wisdom, Love, No Symbols, and no Types of hidden Things. The slave to sense, he sees but with his eyes, Not with his heart, and in the realm of Truth And Freedom, as an alien he stands; He has no fatherland, nor doth he know The End and Meaning of his being here! The sun shines on him as it does upon The thricetrod Dust, and leaves him as it found, Unquickened and unvivified to good. Far other Boon has Nature for the pure, And Innocent of Heart; to them she is A living presence; from her Lips they learn A Lore illsought in Books, where oft we find The Beggartreasures of the Brain, which leave The Spirit barren 'mid its seeming wealth. To me the falling Leaf has Music sweet With no vain meanings fraught, and from the song Of the skysoaring Lark, I catch a tone Of kindred inspiration: oft at Eve, The gurgling Brook has lulled my Soul to rest; Stretched at the mossy Foot of some old Oak, Whose stormbeat Trunk examples us to strive In noble silence, 'gainst the ills of Life, With thickwove Canopy of twinkling Leaves, Starproof, save where some peeping Aperture, Let in a wandering Ray of dewy Light On my uplifted Eye, there have I layn, Submitting my whole Being to the shapes Of heavenly Thought, making my Life a Dream; Or rather waking from a harsh, dull Dream, To be, not seem, and feel I really live! Then as the Moon rose silvering Tree and Tower, I've hied me to my quiet Home, the while Crossing some Churchyard dim, with solemn step And slow, as though I feared, vain thought! to break The sleeper's rest; yet who on human Dust Can set a careless foot, nor pause awhile, To think what lies beneath him; what it is, And has been, ere the cold, unconscious Clay, Fell with its hollow Sound; ere yet was spread Their Banquet for the Worms. Oh! who can feel Here, as he feels elsewhere, or by the Tomb Refuse the Warning, and the Pledge it gives, Nor bear away with him a wiser Heart Than that he brought? with such thoughts have I pass'd Through the Old yew-trees nodding green o'er Graves, Whose grassy Bosoms look so calm and blest, Like quiet Pillows for a weary Head, That long has pressed the thornier one of Life. Listing brief moment to the warning note Of the gray Steepleclock, from whence the Hours Fly off, like fullfledged birds that ne'er again Return unto the Nest! then with the calm Selfconcentrated spirit such scenes breed, I seek my own dear home where all I love Are waiting for my step, and feel at rest. I thank thee God, for this, for everything: But chiefest for that Spirit which by thee, And thy good blessing, can accord the sounds, The sights, the shapes, the hues, of outer being, To vital types of inner harmony; Notes of that Music whose deep spirit dwells In our own hearts, tho' roused by outward things; A Chorus of internal voices, which Find echos thro' all Earth, Air, Sea, and Sky; Strings of th' eternal Harp, whose strain is Love And Truth, for ever echoing God's Name! WHAT MAKES US RICH. 1. That which we consciously possess alone Is ours, that only is real Wealth: of all That lavish Fortune wastes on us, how small A Portion can be truly called our own! Beyond Life's simpler Wants, supplied, that on High Cares the Soul may dwell, all that we call Our own, is not possessed: the splendid Hall And Banquet we can scarce enjoy for one Feastnight, and quicker than the Flowers, which Festooned the walls, they fade from Memory! Such things may make us seem a moment rich, But only seem; they serve but to bewitch The Sense: real Blessings are not for the Eye, They ask a sober Soul, far 'neath the surface lie 2. Their Roots, both sound and deep must be too: they Must firmly grasp this common Earth whereon We live, and from which we can raise alone The daily Bread for which each Heart should pray, Its most familiar Affections: yea! For from these only 'neath the blessed Sun Man's happiness is drawn; else God has done Wrongly to frame us thus, and bid us say, Â«Our FatherÂ» even to himself, before All meaner Names! what is a Bible bound With Gold, to him who feels its blessed Lore, Its Meaning? it exists not â he has found The one true vein of Life's enriching ore, And with that neither wants, nor wishes more! 3. And tell me onceagain, oh! what is all The Pomp and Glitter of the World, to one Who feels its Meaning, lives in that alone Full of this sublime Consciousness! how small, How worthless in his sight, could he recall Its nothingness to mind, while gazing on The golden Stars, hung like bright Lamps upon The Pillars of this vast and skydomed Hall, Which is his Dwellingplace, howpoorsoe'er He be, a Palace beyond that of Kings! Yea! more: a Temple, where throughout the year Each Day's a Sabbath, and where he can hear The Preacher preaching ever, and where Spring's Own Hand unto the mighty Altar brings The Wreath, which Earth doth in his honour wear! 4. Yea! it is worthless, as to him may be The golden Binding, who kneels down and prays And thinking only of his Mission, says Â«Our Father, which art in HeavenÂ»! What should we Then seek? the inner wealth, which makes us free And godlike! 'till all else seems drossy, base, Unfit of during Worth to take the Trace. What is it we possess most consciously, At all Times, in all Places, ever on The same? our Minds, our Hearts, our ownselves! yea! These make us rich: and he is so alone, Who o'er himself hath gained a complete Sway, O'er his own Thoughts! he who feels not his own Self, consciously, exists not one may say. Possess thyself then consciously: thus thou Wilt have, and be, the Godlike which thou art, For God's own Spirit dwells in thee e'en now; And feeling this, what more can human Heart Desire? for where God is, is Heaven too; And what have earthly things, where heavenly are, to do? TO COLOGNE CATHEDRAL. 1. How glorious this vast and timeworn pile! Amid whose speaking, hoar antiquity, Sits heavenly Meditation, and on high Spreads her still wings above the pillared Aisle, That shoots up branchingly, as to beguile The heart of all its earthliness: the eye Is lost amid the roof's Immensity Of dimlylighted space, that wakes meanwhile A corresponding amplitude of thought. How holily the light falls broken on Yon' scattered groups, from the tall windows caught, Streaming in rainbowhues from off the Sun, On Age's wrinklÃ«d face, to beauty wrought By prayer, if not of Youth, yet all its own! 2. And on the fair, calm brow of infancy, Lisping its pure prayer, with as pure a heart; What study for a painter's graphic art, In the dim groups that in the shade half lie Of the tall columns, thus, unconsciously, Making the scene so picturesque! each part Has its own charm of feeling: scarce a smart Of earthly grief but in this calm might die Into a Sense almost of bliss: and lo! The blent and whispering accents rise around, One mighty voice of prayer; a solemn Sound, That in its sweetness strong, yet soft and low, O'erpowers us: oh God! he who has found Thee, unto him is neither weal nor woe! 3. 'Tis past! the last faint accents murmuring die In lingering echos thro' the stilly Pile, Like a departed blessing: and awhile A deep, long Silence marks expressively Its sweet Impression: scarce a stifled sigh Breaks on the holy Calm, and up the aisle On Rapture's wings is borne, as to beguile The full intensity of Prayer: the high And holy thoughts of God alone may dare To enter here; methinks 'twere rich e'en now To mingle, like a spirit, with the air, Aud pass away from all Earth's fretting, low, And gnawing cares, e'en 'mid the Gush and Glow Of Thoughts that in Eternity do share! TO THE SPIRIT OF HUMANITY. To thee divinest Spirit, kneeling low, I, on thine Altar, offer up my Heart; Accept it: purify the baser Part, And fill it with thy holy Flame, e'en tho' Therewith't must be consumed; enough, if no Unworthy Feeling of brute Fear impart Aught earthly to that sacred Flame â thou art My Muse; thou touch'dst my Heart, and thence did flow The Poesy of Life, for there alone The Springhead is. And eversince the Day, When on thy divine Breast, a Child I lay, And to thy mighty Heart attuned mine own, Sweeter than Minstrelssong or Poetslay, Has ever seemed to me the simplest Tone Of human Love, to cheer me on my Way! And now, great Spirit, thankfully I kneel And ask of thee nought more, than still to feel And be a Man, before all else â not Fame, Nor Garland for my Brow, nor Wealth, nor Name, I ask, but only in my Breast an Heart, In all Man's Joys and Griefs to take a Part! WISDOM. Good: Evil! to the Wiseman are all one; Nay! in his sublime Eye, the chastened Tear Of Grief, serves but to make all Things more clear And beautiful, beneath God's blessed Sun; It dims not; throws no sickly Hues upon The fresh, fair Forms of Being; and the Sphere, Where he to full Advantage doth appear, Is Suffering's hard School â there hath he won The Sceptre of the Kingdom of Freewill! There reigns supreme o'er his own Thoughts, in which True Empire lies; for these, thro' Good and Ill Abide with him unaltered! â these make rich The Beggar, and his Mind, like Angels, fill, And keep him, e'en in Rags, a Godlike Being still! And as the sickly Muscle daily to The Pearl which kills it, gives new Lustre, by The Sacrifice of its own Wellfare; so By earthly Suffering and Misery, The Wiseman perfects his own Soul â and when On the Worldoceansshore, the Pearl doth lie, To which the meaner Part was offer'd, then The Angels stoop, and hymning joyously, Replace the Jewel in God's Crown again! ON HEARING AN ELDTIME SONG. 1 Thou good old song that like a gleam Of sunshine comest on my Heart, From good old Times, that like a Dream Are past, yet of our life a part! 2 Thou good old song of good old Times, Oftcarolled 'neath the Greenwoodtree, Or mingled with the Evening-chimes That told of Villagerevelry! 3 Thou good old song, oft sung beneath The Maypole's nighforgotten ring, By merry lips, that lent their breath To thee with an heartwelcoming! 4 Thou living voice from olden times, That like a spirit travellest on From lip to lip, from Heart to Heart Linking our own to those long gone. 5 'Tis with a throbbing heart I hear Thy wellknown voice of harmonies, Float, like past boyhood, on my ear, With old ancestral memories! 6 Oh! thou art as an unseen soul That communes with us, till we be Quite space-and-timefree, blended all With thy deep Essence lovingly. 7 Thou art a stirring note blown on Imagination's magic horn, But out of date in these dull days, When Faith is of her visions shorn. 8 And ever as that note I hear, My Soul with its far echoes shakes, It strikes not on the claycoarse ear, But a far deeper sense awakes! 9 And as I list, hark! I do hear The wartramp of the fireeyed steed, The shout on some old Battlefield, Where Right once wrought some glorious deed. 10 Another breath on Fancy's horn, Whose stops are manifold as thought, And to my mindseye, fresh as Morn, Another scene is instant brought: 11 Oh! I do see a forestglade Where antlered Deer steal thro' old oaks, And huntinghorns in echoes fade, With woodman's quick, treefelling strokes. 12 I see on 'yon green oakgirt knoll Whose Top one Kingtree shadows o'er With ampler leafage, a blithe band Of bowmen stout, a score or more. 13 And they are there with horn and bow, Staunchwinded hounds and hearts as light As the green leaves, thro' which e'en now The Springwind breathes its gentle might. 14 And they are dressed in forestgreen, Such as the Sherwood clan once wore, And gliding now the boughs between, Lo! they are gone for evermore! 15 Gone, gone, and faded far away Into that forest dim and vast; Preserved from the rude axe's sway, And still kept sacred to the Past! 16 Oh Fancy! but for thy good ear, Their merry songs were heard no more, And but for thy good eye, we ne'er Should glimpses catch of days of yore! 16 But thou dost love to fly away From these harsh scenes that round us lie, With sunshine of a bygone Day To chear thy heart and glad thine eye! 17 Thou hast bright visions of the Past, And spite of axe, and steam, and plough, Thy woods and landscapes still outlast All change that Time effects below! 18 With fairer hues than those of Truth Thy sunny scenes embathed arise; And fixed in bright, unfading youth Return to cheer our agedim eyes! 19 Another Note! and other Scenes, Like Summerclouds o'er waters pass, The Shadows which far Ages fling, O'ersweeping the Soul's Magicglass. 20 That Mirror where forgotten Things Their faded Forms oft body forth, Gazing on which our Thoughts take wings, And learn, like newfledged Birds, their Worth. 21 Things seen are beautiful 'tis true, But those unseen are fairer still, For they are clothed with other Hue Than those the Weekday-Eye which fill! 22 Distance makes sweetest Melody, And to old Songs which thus have come From haunted Eld, with Meanings high, The Heart gives an enduring Home. 23 These, with the Voices of our Youth, Are on our Lips a spell of Beauty, A Form wherein Eternal Truth Still charms the Heart to Love and Duty. 24 They tell of Things above the Reach Of chance and change, and that the Heart, When it beats truly, can the Breath Of Immortality impart! 25 Thoughts that pass on from sire to Son, Thro' th'universal heart undying, Are beams of Truth's Eternal Sun, Which gather strength thus flying. 26 Such thoughts still live in ye, ye Songs, Ye old heartcherished songs of yore, Heartgraved ye need not fear the wrongs, That Time or Change can bring your Lore. 27 Ye cannot perish! from the dust Of our forefather's graves ye speak With their own voices, and a trust Ye bring us which we dare not break. 28 The seeds of mighty thoughts lie hid Ye old heartcoined songs in ye, Ye are Time's Voices, and ye bid Old truths speak to posterity. 29 Ye cannot perish! for ye breathe From each old grassgrown battlefield, Ye are like spirits, and beneath Our Feet the Caves your Echo yield. 30 Ye cannot perish! for ye sigh Round each grey timeworn castletower, Where freedom's champions doomed to die, Have left each stone a spell of power! 31 Ye reach us from those bygone Years Like Voices from another World, The Language of immortal Fears And Hopes, whose Banner long is furled! 32 Ye cannot perish! they who chaunt Your strains, do feel an inward might, As if tenthousand hearts did haunt Our heart, and joined their pulses with it! 33 And tho' the Voice of man were mute In some degenerate land of shame, The winds would whisper ye, and bruit Your memories, like an airfanned flame. 34 Ye blessed songs, heartmusic sweet To those who freedom's Voice do know, There is no minstrelsy so meet To stir the soul with Virtue's glow. 35 With ye at daybreak, the bold Swiss Climbing the sunlit mountainheight, Pours forth in orisons his bliss, And drinks into his soul delight. 36 He learns ye from his mother's tongue, Thus intertwined ye grow with all Of good or bright, in Truth or Song, That can his Afterlife befall. 37 And like sweet dew, your memory Falls on his Heart in Afterdays, To keep it still from blight, with high And holy thoughts to cheer his ways. 38 He hears ye in the woodstream call, He lists ye in the winds above, And thundering from the waterfall, Ye speak of Liberty and Love! 39 And when a tyrant would enchain, He sings his old Songs lustily, And with these on his heart and lip, He feels the will and strength to die! 40 Ye song's; ye are a potent spell And in our hearts as 'twere The breath of holy Oracle, A creed which Love has hallowed there. 41 Blessings be with ye, and high praise, For oldtimessake, the Times of Song, The homely beauty of those days, Of simple Speech and Feelings strong! 42 From Heart to Heart, ye speak for aye, And with Love's soullinked chain ye bind Past unto Present, and to day With comeing times, one heart, one mind! 43 From ye we learn humanity, And fellowcreature cares and fears; And snatch from self to sympathy With nobler things of bygone years. 44 Then be ye by the baby sung Scarcelisping on his mother's arm; And by the oldman to whose tongue His Cradlesongs have still a charm. 45 Oh! be ye sung by young and old From castlehall to lowly bower, On Newyearsnight let tales be told Of olden times, by Rich and Poor. 46 Thus shall our Hearts hold intercourse, In thoughts which hallow equally Both high and low, which are a source Of Harvests rich in sympathy. 47 For these, alas! are selfish days, And the poorman hath nought to glean Where Avarice his sickle lays And Pride's heartcrushing step hath been. 48 Some good old things have passed away That could not bettered be by new, And hearts are severed now-a-day, Which might be lovelinked, kind and true. 49 Esteem which closecements all ranks, Without which law is mockery, Hath fled; rank selfishness o'erbanks, And men look on with evil eye. 50 Gold is the measure of all worth, And what this yellow dust cant buy, Is cast aside or trod to Earth Tho' 'twere an angel's dowery! 51 The Altarflame of that old cause, The holy cause of better days And nobler minds, who knew that Laws Are worthless, when they from the praise 52 Of God and Truth are turned, to wealth And moneygrasping Ends â That flame Is flickering, gone its strength and health, Its holy heat no more the same! 53 But in its stead, is kindled now A smokedimmed and unholy light, To a foul Idolgod, whose low Clayworshippers are soulless quite. 54 Selfseekers offering to this God, As pearl to swine, all feelings high, Not illnamed Â«WealthÂ» whose hoofs have trod Down, Honor, Love, and Liberty. 55 And left the marks, so deep and strong, Of his soulsoiling, bestial Tread In the whole Nation's Heart, that wrong If gilt, of worth may take the lead! 56 Woe unto ye, my countrymen! The soil into your Souls hath eat; Ye have become I say, a den Of moneychangers in God's very seat! 57 Woe unto thee! my Motherland, That such disnatured sons be thine, Their shame, e'en as a firebrand, Shall search thy womb, thy Glory tine! 58 That wellearned Fame which with so bright And Rainbowgrasp of splendor shone Above thy Brow, forsakes our sight, Its promise fades, already gone. 59 The Echo of a coming woe, A Voice from out the wilderness, Is on thine ear, oh! bow thee low, Repent thee, that thy God may bless! 60 Oh put this leprous curse away That plaguelike cleaveth to thy limbs; Oh teach thy lips, hearttuned, to pray, Hard falls has he who rashly climbs. 61 Push back the brimming cup of Sin, Thou drunk with worse than wine! which now Is at thy lips; thus shalt thou win Pardon above and Hope below! 62 Oh turn ye to the good old cause Of wealthdespising lowliness, And make in your own hearts your laws, With pure thoughts for sole witnesses. 63 Oh turn unto the days yore, When Faith her Martyrsons could name, And Liberty's untainted Lore, From Heart to Heart, passed as a Flame. 64 Oh turn unto the days when Faith Could build Cathedralpiles thro' Love, And Hosts therein, as with one breath, Their true heartoffering sent above! 65 Oh turn unto the days of old, When unreproved and free, Old songs were sung, old tales were told, And Hall and Bower rang to their glee. 66 Turn ye unto the times I say, When noble thoughts were welcome more To English Ears, than at this day Vile clinking Gold by knaves told o'er! 67 Oh turn ye to the Householdlaws, The Firesidelaws of Peace and Love, Where Wisdom feeds her little ones, And fashions them for Him above! 68 Oh turn unto our Shakespear's Page, And read of Harry's Chivalry, Of gallant deeds, which are a gage For like unto Posterity. 69 Oh then shall Freedom on Time's Lyre Strike with a willing hand the strain Of oldendays, and Hampden's fire, And Milton's tongue be heard again! 70 Then Faith shall have her martyrnames, Tho' not firetested be their worth, And patient Charity, who tames Old hatreds, give to Love new birth! 71 Then Freedom's bright Electric Chain Shall stretch o'er Hamlet, Town, and Tower, And good, old Songs be heard again In knightly Hall, in Cot, and Bower! 72 Then too my Fatherland, thy fame With Rainbowbreadth once more shall rise, Scattering the Storms thro' which it came, Like Dawn unto long Watcher's eyes! 73 And thus, when thou must sink again Within thine own eternal Sea, The Guardianangels still their strain Shall sing, and hail thee, Â«bless'd and free.Â» AN UNBRIDLED FANCYBURST, OR PRELUDE TO A DEATHTALE. Let my discourse be as the Nightowlscry, The Forenote to a deed of Darkness; let Its Hue, be as the Air, wherein he oars His unsunned and illomened Flight, athawrt The dank, gravetenanted Churchyard, what time Midnight, the still and sightless Labourer, Builds up the keystone of nightsarch, on which The coming Day has placed his unseen Foot; And the sad Clock tolls out the past Day's Death, When the last hour of all the twelve, fullfledged, Has flown in silence to Eternity! Let the Deathraven's earoffending Note, Robed in the darkness of his plumage, on The Gibbetchains, expectant of his prey, Be Music unto mine; and let my Tongue, The very Messenger of Horror's self, Unto a tuneless deed, lend tuneless notes, Coined by Fear's ashen Lip â Now let your Blood Be icetouched at the Thought, whose outline dim, Like to a Ghost's, steals on you; let each Hair, As with an individual touch of dread, Start up on End. Imagination! lift The Veil, which hides the portals of the Grave, And unlid quite the Mindseye, for all sense Of feebler Edge were out of Season here, To look upon the thing that I would draw; And push Conception to the farthest Brink Of Crime's most fathomless, eyedazzling height, And in the dread Abyss behold my thought Shadowed in hues which are not of this Earth! But gaze not long, lest dizziness and dread Should overbalance thee, and thou be lost Beyond all reach of Heaven's blessÃ«d Light; Where never ray of Star or Sun was sent, But baleful Glooms, and shapeless Darkness wrap Thee round for evermore! TO MILTON. Milton! by thee true Glory's Goal was won; Yet meaner spirits may not copy thee, Or to such height of true sublimity Uplift their Thoughts. Shall earthborn Spirits run A Race with thee, thou courser of the Sun, Whose path was thro' the Heaven's privacy, A solitude of Light and Glory, nigh The Eternal Fount of Truth? thou stand'st alone, In Mind quite unapproachable; yet still The humblest Heart may learn to imitate Thy Patriotspirit, selfsubduÃ«d Will, And that blest art, which from the Ills of fate Extracts a blessing; glorying to fulfill In thy high footsteps what it owes the state! THE ALPROSE. Hast thou not bade the Alprose bloom to thee Allbounteous God! tho' mortal foot has rare, Or never trod the Eternal Snows, which there Worship thee silently; nor curious Eye Sought in the wilderness thy testimony? Let us not idly deem that aught in Air Or Earth is barren beauty, so it bear A witness unto thee; 'tis hallowÃ«d by That thought, and has a moral beauty far Beyond the pomp of thrones! that lone flower might Emblem true piety; which, like a star, Dwells 'mid a privacy of modest light, Blessing unseen, unnoticed 'mid the glare, Her sole reward, the Bliss of acting right! THE DAYSEYE. Sweet Flower, thou art a link of memory, An emblem to the heart of bright Days flown; And in thy silence too there is a tone That stirs the inmost Soul, more potently Than if a Trumpetsvoice had rent the sky! I love thee much, for when I stray alone, Stealing from Nature her calm thoughts, which own No selfdisturbance, and my curious eye Catches thy magic glance, methinks a spell Has touched my Soul; once more I grow a Boy; Once more my thoughts, that, as a Passingbell, Seemed to toll o'er departed shapes of Joy, Change to old chimes, and in my bosom swell Fresh Pulses of a bliss without Alloy! ON THE ROADSIDESEATS IN PARTS OF GERMANY. What Hand, with kind solicitude, has sown These shady Trees along life's toilsome way, And placed these rudecarved seats, that seem to say, Â«Rest, weary Traveller, for 'tis thine own, 'Tis dedicate to theeÂ» â Pride, Pomp, have shown Me their most dazzling scenes â alas! they may Not touch the Heart; from wealth we turn away, Illgot, illused, with Indignation's frown Of just contempt! but in Humanity, The simplest act of Love, how small so e'er We find a Beauty and a Sanctity Beyond the pomp of Thrones, that renders dear To Heart and Memory; with meanings high, Hallowing the meanest thing we see and hear! TO THE GENTIAN. Sweet flower of holiest blue! why bloom'st thou so In solitary Loveliness, more fair In this thy artless beauty, than the rare And costliest Gardenplant? why do'st thou grow On the unthankful Icecliff's printless brow, Like the fond offerings, which true Hearts bear To the cold Inmate of the grave! the Air Is redolent of Heaven, and thy glow Of azure blue is caught from thence; but why Hid'st thou thy beauties from the sight of man? There is a Moral in thy privacy! Truth will not grow where vulgar eyes may scan, Or hand's unholy pluck-'tis for the sky She blooms, and those who seek, must climb, nor fear to die! HOME. Home! word that sums all Joy, sole fountainhead Of the deep stream of Bliss, if any be; There is no substitute on Earth for thee; Once lost, the sense of happines is fled, And in the heart, a cold, dull void instead Is left, that Time cannot fill up â thy high And holy pleasures have the purity Of Heaven's best gifts; and e'en the daily bread Wrung from the sweat of poverty and pain, With thee, is sweeter than the costly fare Of Kings who know thee not; who in their vain And empty pageantry, can have no share Of these thy inward blessings, which disdain, Save in the pure heart, their sweet fruits to bear! A NIGHTSTORMSEASCENE! The Clouds are piled in wild confusion, like The fragments of a World just broken up, In Giantshapes of gloom: and dim, the Moon Faintraying makes but darkness visible, As tho' she dared not gaze on such a scene! More rayless grows the Night, for from the face Of Heaven she's swept; and straight the Mountainclouds, Like Icebergs, in collision dire clash, And forth the Thunder's pent-up Fury leaps, Like some mad courser plunging thro' the Sky; As tho' the Stormfiend's steed had cast the rein, And with his Thunderhoof and Lightningeye, Was dashing past upon his midnight-track Of murkiest darkness, while at each dread stamp Heaven's shuddering vault seems rent; at each far flash Of his dilated Eye, the cloudwreaths shrink, Up withered like a scroll, beneath his glance, That ploughs the womb of night up far and nigh With Light unutterable â then, a pause, A fearful Lull broods on the sulphurous air, As when Hate gathers up his outbreathed might; And save a nervous quiver all seems still! The Giantclouds are stirless, and the fiend, The Stormfiend hovers on highpoisÃ«d wing, Like a vast vulture, ere he swoops down on His cowering Prey: but, hark! a thunderpeal Fills the still heavens with a thousand tongues Of gathering wrath; and every teeming cloud, As 'twere a spirit's shroud, is rent in twain, And flash on flash, and peal on peal, in bright And quick succession pour; while the mad winds Sweep the wild Panorama o'er the sky, O'er glen and echoing vale, o'er flashing stream, Foaming in fireflakes through forestshades, Whose moist leaves sparkle like a thousand Gems, And o'er the towering Mountain's brows, awhile Crown'd with flamewreaths, then clothed in tenfold Gloom. At fitful intervals, with ghastly smile, Like that, which comes and goes, on dying Cheek, Thro' her cloudveil, the Moon steals out, now dark, Now dim, now brighter; as the varying Winds Sweep the stormfragments, dense or thin, away; Still some stray Thunderclap, with far off growl, Dies, like a muttered curse, upon the gale, As down below the Horizon's verge, once more, The Stormfiend hurries with his panting Steeds, Into Chaotic Night; and as he sinks, The Ocean's yeasty breast seeths wild and high, Flashing in foam and fury 'neath the tread Of the wavespurning steeds, whose thunderhoofs Strike lightning thro' the Deeps, as tho' they were Ploughed in firefurrows, and each foaming Crest A cataract of light, o'ercurving down To the dark Gulf below! a moment, and Night strews a deeper mantle o'er the scene; And save the sullen Dash of hurtling waves, That fall tumultuous, as with a dead, Unsinewed weight, Silence broods o'er the Deep, And Terror, clothed in Darkness, with her sits! SABBATHBELLS. 1 Oh! Sabbathbells, your merry chime Reminds me of another time, Of days when gladsome smiles would shine, Of days, when still a home was mine. 2 But ye have no such memory, Ye know not of the hopes that die, And tho' the Heart aches as ye bring Past fancies up, yet still ye ring. 4 Ah! little dreamt I in my youth That ye could speak a bitter truth, Ah! little dreamt I that blithe song Could lend its notes to sorrow's tongue. 4 But Time can countermiracle With the same sounds, and of each spell Which charmed us, He a voice can make, Stern, as reality, to wake, 5 I never thought to see this day, Or dreamt homescenes could pass away; I never thought to be alone, And feel that all I loved were gone. 6 Bright, smiling faces pass before Mine Eyes, such as I too once wore, Oh Time! must these young hearts too be, Like mine, ere long prey to thee? 7 'Tis wise and well, that they should learn Selfschooled, Life's secret, and thus earn The lesson of selfgoverment; For peace begins where passion's spent. 8 But oh! if prayer of mine may move, Still let them have a home where Love May bind the bruisÃ«d Heart, and share The spirit's woes else hard to bear. 9 The world is full of false, cold Hearts, Whose Icetouch to the soul imparts A blight, and chills the healthy flow Of Lovethoughts that no distrust know. 10 Thus still imprisoned in the breast, Affections, that should make us blest, Are doomed to pine, unshared to die, In kindred Hearts ne'er fructify. 11 The Heart, it cannot live alone, There is no Music in its Tone 'Till with another heart it be Accorded to sweet harmony. 12 Love is the keynote, and when this Is wanting, then its music is Like that of jangled Chimes, which tells Of Sweetness gone, of broken spells! 13 Sweet days, that ne'er may be again, Whose memory has nought of pain, Except that ye are past away; The lightsome Heart, the Spirits gay. 14 Sweet days, when thought lay slumbering deep Like serpent 'neath life's flowers asleep; With the heart's simple pleasures ne'er Mixed poison, nor would interfere. 15 Thoughtfree, Heartfree, Oh Time of bliss, My best reward a Mother's kiss; A look of Love, a small kind word, Could make me blithe as summerbird! 16 Oh then my heart was all my own, Yet all of others, as a tone, Which is and is not, till it be Mixed with its like in harmony! 17 Ye Flowers, that blossom at my feet, Why are ye still so fresh and sweet, I have no more glad Boyhood's Eye Nor in my heart youth's revelry! 18 Oh that with boyhood's Hand and Heart, With thoughts which ye alone impart To Childhood, I could pluck ye still, And take from early founts my fill. 19 It may not be â Time's set his seal Upon the Past, and soon I feel, That ye must bloom o'er my gravesod, On which a careless Boy I trod! 20 Be still my Heart; why throb'st thou so? To Dust thou'lt crumble, cold and low! Peace noisy Thoughts; few Feet beneath This Sod, there is a Calm â like Death! 21 Ye Sabbathbells, ye Change your Tone, Like false Friends, and at length I own, What in my Youth I could not fear, That ye have more than meets the Ear! 23 That selfsame Chime that rings e'en now So blithe and merry tells of Woe; And Deathbelltones, feared in my Youth, Speak now a sadlypleasing Truth! 23 They wellcome to that last, long Bourne, Where weary Spirits cease to mourn; They speak of some still Churchyardnook, With mossy Turf, and neighbouring Brook. 24 Then ring your Chimes in every key, From Grave to Cradle, as may be, And I will listen with an Ear That undisturbed each Tone shall hear. 25 As undisturbed, as you yourselves, Who when a Grave the Sexton delves, Or when a Marriagetrain appears, Lend the same Tongue to Smiles and Tears! 6 Ye are but passing Notes of Time, Not set to Heaven's eternal Chime; Ye ring but earthly Things to Dust; Your Sabbathnotes speak Hope and Trust! THE ART OF ENJOYMENT. Whate'er thou wouldst enjoy, enjoy it quite, As perfect in itselfâ thus will it be, Even if otherwise, so unto thee; Thou mak'st it so: 'tis so unto thy Sight, And that's enough! think not still how it might Be better with this and with that; keep free Thy Mind from idle Wishes; these are the Worst Bane of Happiness: wish what is right, The Sureattainable; and if thou'rt wise, Thou wilt have one Wish only, but that one Will the Fullfilment in itself comprize Of every other; wish to be alone Thyself; to be the Soul which in thee lies; This Good once gained, then thou canst want for none; For who dwells in thee? God! â then if thou art That which is in thee, thou must be a Part Of Him; and where He is what want can rise? To say, Â«how pleasant would it be, if I Had this and thatÂ»; this is the Fool's dull Way Who for the Distant spoils the Sure and Nigh, Makes vain the beating Heart and open Eye! Go to 'yon Hound for Wisdom; in the Ray Of Sunlight, which the Clouds may snatch away Ere the next Moment, careless doth he lie, Basking, as if 'twould last eternally! So in the passing Hour lives the Wise, It yields enough to fill both Heart and Eye; And from a full Heart no vain Wishes rise! A PASSING THOUGHT. 'Twas in Arezzo; in the public Square, I stood hardby the Fountain gushing clear; I saw, yet saw not; heard, yet did not hear, The Maidens fill their Pails; for I was there As in a Dream: mine Eyes fixed in a Stare, Yet heedless what they gazed at; and mine Ear, Unconscious of the Bustle, tho' so near. One of those Moments, when our Spirts are As disembodied â a Surcease of Thought, When the Wheel rests, and all the Toil is o'er, Wherewith the busy Brain its Fancies wrought; And when our Souls, like Dewdrops, are once more By the great Whole absorbed, and Earth seems nought But as a rolling Ball, or Wave seen from the Shore; It whirls unfelt beneath our Feet, and as A Bubble, from our Eyes we see it pass; Time, Space exist no more, we feel alone Ourselves, and all Things then to us are one! TRUE REFORM. If ye can change men's Thoughts; if inwardly Ye alter them, then shortly will ye see, (As when the new Sap rises in the Tree), The outward Features of Society, Change of themselves, and unavoidably. There is the viewless Spirit, which should be Like to the Breath of God; which none can see And yet all feel as still it passes by Over the Face of Earthâ it breathes upon The Thrones of Tyrants, and behold! they're gone, Like Dewdrops meltedâ it glides past their Side, And at its viewless Presence, in their Pride They tremble; Lo! their Hearts with sudden Fear Are struck, and in their mantles would they hide Their Heads, as tho' some Spectreform did glide Before them; but it whispers in their Ear, 'Tis God's own Voice, and they perforce must hear! It breathes upon the Nations, and they wake, And like a Nightmare, from their Bosoms shake The Prejudices which are worn and sere! THE POETSHARP. Oh change the Harpstrings, change them once again, For those of old, those of my Heart are now Nighbroken, and the Music which would flow From them, would be so steeped in utter Pain, That if ye've Hearts, ye could not bear the Strain. Oh that mine Heart might never speak of Woe, But, like the Seashell, echoing only to The Might and Gladness of the changeless Main, Tell of the Blessedness, and Peace alone And changeless Durableness of Whence it came, Nor take from Man's so troubled Life one Tone! Like to this lovely World, which to his Name Who made it, is a Hymn of Joy; the same That at Creation's Dawn rose to his Throne! THE HOUR OF HOMEPARTING TOLD BY A CHURCHCLOCK. 1. But yet a momentâ one brief moment more, And the sterntonÃ«d Hour, his chime will ring, As unconcerned, as tho' his note could bring No sense of Pain! A moment, yet how sore! Whose paltry space weighs on the sick Heartscore Until each pulse be Agony; each string, As of my inmost Soul is quivering, While Time his careless fingers runneth o'er The spirit's chords; the hour stops not for me; He is no courtier; he will not stay In gilded Antirooms; no Flattery Honeys his tongue; but on his sober way, Plain Teller of a simple History, He moves, unheeding what he brings or bears away! 2. The Clock has struck; sharp, cold, distinct, and clear; Not one, sole, moment wanting to complete Time's mystic Round; he ne'er doth falsely beat; Aye with unerring step the hours bear The burthen of our deeds awayâ the Tear, The Laugh, the Song, the Joy, the Kiss so sweet Of first unsulliÃ«d Love, all these must fleet, As Flowers ripe in season! wouldst thou hear Soulthrilling tones, Music that is a spell To stir the Heart, as Nightwinds Forestleaves? Go, list at eve, unto the Villagebell, With its old clock, beneath the gray Towereaves And think what thou hast been! oh heed thou well Its Comment on the Graveâ such thought retrieves 3. The faults and follies of the Past: seat thee Upon some mossy tomb, 'till the Moonsrays Outbursting, spiritlike, Nightsshroud, with blaze Of Glory wreath it; charm and mystery Shedding o'er all things; 'till with fancies high The spot run o'er; look down where stern Time plays His solemn Game, Earth unto Earth he says, And Dust to Dust! but shouldst thou troubled be At that sad Picture, from Distrust redeem Thy Soul by looking Heavenwards for Light. Then shall the Flowers on the Grave seem bright As those of Spring; nay, shall not only seem, But be: for such they are when viewed aright, Types of a happier Spring unto the wise Man's Sight! 4. Then shall that Light on all things round thee play, And that same narrow trench shall seem to be, The fairest Heritage that Earth for thee Reserves of all her Treasures: then the ray Of Truth eterne within, shall force its way Thro' thy past Being's darkness strong and bright, As a Lamp newly fed! oh then thy sight Shall look abroad on Earth and find it gay As in thy boyish years, the bloom once more Restored to all that seemed so sere before. Then shall thy Heart expand a second Spring, Yet ripe as Autumn! a right goodly Tree Whose better Fruits have reached maturity. And Time who seemed to snatch with withering Wing Each choicest bliss, youth's moments back shall bring; Regive the Heart its freshness and its glee, Its early dews, the power to bless, and be Blessed in all it sees and feels, in everything! 5. So has it fared with me: in my young hours I loved all things as with a Brother's Love, Each in its kind, the Lion and the Dove, The suneyed Eagle, and the Mole; the flowers That star wild brake or lea; the leafy Bowers, Where true Inheritors of Joy still rove, Making their lives one hymn: all these could move My spirit, like a spell; with hidden powers, Amid such sights and sounds, I seemed to grow Replete and strong; Joy still producing Joy The more I shared, and all without alloy. Thus I grew up with Nature, and her Brow Was as my Mother's; Time could not destroy One thought she gave, nor Custom render low! 6. But evil days came o'er me with their blight, And my soul grew eclipsed! in cloudy ways Of doubt and fear it strayed; a chilling haze, The Earth's dark shadow, past 'twixt it, like night And its true source: it caught no more the light Of heavenly thought, nor shed reflected rays Of Glory on the Earth; awhile it was Cast out of Eden, yet lost not all Sight, Seeking a blessing which was not; which ne'er By Discontent's sad hand is pluckedâ then Flower, And Bird, and Brook, were out of tune: their Power Is in the Heart, but when the keynote here Is wanting, like bewildered chimes they pour, Not memories sweet, but discord on the Heart and Ear! 7. Telling us what we are not, nor can be, Until we make atonement; thus we hear The merry Eveningbells ring blithe and clear, And feel that they are not for usâ their glee Has Madness in its Mirth; a mockery, That calls the big Tear to the Eye; the Tear Shed over Hopes and Scenes too sweet, which ne'er Can be as they have beenâ Oh Memory Why hauntest thou the sad chill graves of yore, Staying Time's mouldering hand? the Moss that grows So kindly, as it were to spare our throes, And hide the Names we love, for evermore, Thou cleanest off the stone, and then it shows Words which, like Daggers, pierce us to the Core! 8. Oh! we must make atonement; we must be In heart as little children, e'er again We taste what we have tasted, or may drain The Plentyhorn of Nature! the pure glee Of Birds and Beasts, that with their Sympathy For her, have mixed no fretting thoughts, no pain For Things to be, or been: alas! in vain We toil, and fret and toilâ Time hurries by, Stealing our fruitful Moments, and instead Brings us but barren Years! our hearts are dead Within our Breasts, for selfish thoughts are there, Which make its Beatings vain: the fountainhead Runs o'er with discontent, its waters bear Blight to Youth's flowers once so fresh and fair! 9. So has it fared with me; but I am one Who loved and love my God with all my Heart, And Mind and Soul; and over such the Smart Of Sorrow passes light. I have lost none Of my Soul's Gifts; her Wings are now fullgrown, And bear me to Highplacesâ to each part Of this fair world where Nature's forms impart Their Boundlessness to us: whence I look down On Ocean; like the Seashell grows my Breast, Left by the Flood, or haply long before, But echoing to its Source for evermore, Tho' so, so far removed: Oh Reader haste To do likewise; with holy Lip to taste Nature's Lifemilk, ere yet thy Thirst be gone. Make thee a part of her, thus shall Her rest Be thine; thy thoughts as hers, Eternal, Blest! ON A FLOWERWORRED STONETABLE. Ye Flowers, your Stonehues still delight the Eye; Your Marbleblooms have known no sere Decay Of Elements; rude Autumn cannot lay Your brightness in the dust or bid ye die! Yet has the Heart with ye small sympathy, Ye artmade things: e'en Fancy will not play 'Mid your unwindstirred clusters, which no ray Of sunshine ever warmed; we pass ye by With a Chanceglance, and dream of ye no more; For we can pluck ye not to deck the Brow Of those we love; ye give us back no store Of early thoughts; and tho' the flowers that grow Wild in the fields, must wither in their Hour? 'Tis like ourselves, with hopes ye never know! THOUGHT. What is the Warrior's Sword compared with thee? A brittle Reed against a Giant's might. What are the Tyrant's countless Hosts? as light As Chaff before the Tempest: tho' He be Shut in with Guards, and all the Panoply Guilt's Cowardbosom loves, still canst thou smite Him with thy viewless Arm, and from that Height Hurl him into the Dust! for thou art free, Boundless, omnipotent, like God, who gave Thee for his Crowninggift to Man: and when Thou work'st with thy best Weapon, Truth's high Pen, To punish and reform, exalt and save, Thou canst combine Men's Minds, like Rays, in one Allmighty Thought; one Voice, like Heaven's own! THE WISH. What wouldst thou like best on this Earth to see? I know not: so, so many Things throng to My Mind, but of all there are one or two, Which, more than all the Rest must ever be My Heart's deep Longingâ Fancy, plant for me A Bose round every Cottagedoor, and thro' The flowermantled Casement let me view The Housewife with her Children round her knee, Drawing some blessed Lesson from the Page Of God's own Book, and to their tender Age Adapting it, with Illustration clear From Nature's open Volume: for who e'er Taught Wisdom like to her; who touches so And wakes the Heart? thricehappy those who hear Her speak thus by a Mother's Lips so dear! For as, when Children, Nature thus spoke to Them by their Mother's Lip, so when she thro' Death's Gate has passed, she to them will speak by Great Nature's Voice, each thus reciprocally Interpreting the other, and each too More loved and understood, revealed as one, not two! AN ODE, Addressed to a Marble-Lowrelief, in which is represented a Town, with the Townhall crowded as on Marketday, and a Marblesunshine. 1. What gaze ye at thus, with your claycold eyes, And Hearts allstirless as an icÃ«d Stream I'the Midwinter? have the Mysteries Of old Tradition shed on ye no Beam Of foreworld wisdom? has the lipless voice Of sculptured Truth no charms for your soul's ears; Tho' wordless be her Music, to the Eye 'Tis still made visible in outlines choice, A few stray notes from longforgotten Years, Fixed here in unimparÃ«d harmony! 2. A joyous, yet fullsober Tune, whereto The spirit maketh answer; for it has Sweet Revelations thus, Reflections true, And Shadowings, as from a Magicglass, Of its own twofold Life, and inborn worth! Yon sunbeam seems chill as Midwinterice, A Marblemockery to cheat the Eye; Yet does it warm the Soul, not warmth of Earth, But of high Truths, that neither set nor rise, For aye undimmed, 'mid Time's o'erclouded Sky! 3. The Past has its own Voices, its high sights: And holy pulses, living in the Heart Of Nature's self; inalienable rights! Time, the Destroyer, doth to these impart A spirithaunting Power; when he breaks The brute Clayaids whereby to outward sense They were made known, he mingles them as one With universal Being; Nature takes Them back unto her Spiritâ 'tis from hence The present Soul can commune with the gone! 4. Has no ear heard the Deathshout that of yore From old Thermopylee rose to the Sky? To which the mountainechoes back did pour Voices, as 'twere of Human Sympathy, As the brute soil rejoiced; and Wood, and Hill, And haunted Fount sent forth a glad response! For th' Universal Heart beat with those hearts Who fought that day; is it not vocal still In all Earth's Caves and Mountains, now as once, Wherever Freedom her bright Lore imparts? 5. Yea verily! that same old shout has stirred The Hearts and Ears of Men in later days. Its soulawakening summons has been heard In our own Isle: when Milton breathed his Lays, And Hampden bled, that voice was on the Air, An Inspiration in them and around! And the old Spirit with its Firewings Flashed o'er their Vision, which alone could bear The weight of Glory; yea, that very sound Was on their lips, disdaining meaner things! 6. Yea! and the Mountainwinds have lent their Might To that old shout; blent with the Waterfall And Torrentsvoice, it bade the Swiss to fight For their dear Fatherland! a Holy Call, A gathering Cry of ages, unto which The mighty spirits of the days of yore, The Elements and Mountains lent their voice, To which th' Allmighty's answered, like the noise Of Thunder 'mid the Hills, as once before On Sinai, and Nature Chorus bore With all her Voices, to the Lord, her God, Making the cause his own! how far more rich The meanest warrior there in selftaught Lore, As natural, as the Flower to the Sod, And Instinctwisdom, knowing but one choice, 7. Â«To do or dieÂ»; than He whose pride of thought Builds Fancy-commonwealths, and airbased Dreams Of Freedom, 'till by servile chains he's taught That Wisdom, tho' in thought alone she seems To spread her wings, 'till matched with fitting deed, Must want that Lifebreath, without which she is But an Airbubble blown about at will Of vain opinion and vile chance; a reed, Whereon Fools lean, and trust that it may still Uphold the solid weight of Weekday bliss! 8. When man works with his Maker, he can give To his elsefeeble Handyworks, a Might And during Majesty; and thus they live, As Beaconfires, gladdening our dim sight. Thus has this Marblepicture fixÃ«d here A fleeting Scene of Time, a lesson high Of silent Wisdom to a sober Mind, Which seeks for argument of Hope and Fear, Not in the outward forms that 'neath our Eye Return to their own Dust, and leave behind 9. No note of what they are, no solace sweet, No warnings and no Fancies high of Love And holy awe; such things are little meet To teach the Soul to feel itself above Earth's changeful scene, selfcentered in its own High consciousness of inner worth and might. But in such forms as this, which make us feel How, cloudlike o'er the spirit's brightness blown, All changes pass of earthly woe or weal, Leaving it in its strength, unsoiled and bright! 10. Here, inthis Stone, Antiquity survives Herself, and lifts the Veil from bygone things, Revealing truths, which he who wisely hives, Has gathered no mean Honey from Time's wings, Defrauded of their freight: those Citywalls Have longsince crumbled from the Earth; but there We see them standing high, to greet again The curious sight! those thronged and crowded Halls, Which Death has emptied, still show bright and fair, Telling a Truth, 'gainst which he wars in Vain! 11. Thou Stone, wherein the subtle thought of Man Has ta'en a palpable shape; in which we see A Moment stolen from the Past; to scan Thee wakes the Soul to its Immensity, And thought, like widening circles o'er a stream, Embraces silently a World bygone, Till stopped by Time's dim, wreckstrewn shore, which fling Us back upon ourselves; bright Fancies gleam From thee, cold marble, warmer rays than sun E'er shot around, and blithe airs lift hid wings! 12. Oh! that I had a Magicwand to make Those dumb lips speak! how eloquent each Tongue With longdisusÃ«d accents then would break The Sleep of ages! how yon stirless throng Would turn unto the Business of the Day. Oh! idle thought! perhaps they too lived here As if for no hereafter! haply Death O'ertook them on the World's soulsoiling Way, Buying and selling, when their own souls were At stake, and cursing with their latest Breath! 13. Thou Marbleform, that to the vulgar Eye, Art but a Stoneblock carved with sculptured skill, To wiser Minds a pregnant History And Comment on Man's Life, tho' dumb and still! What are we in thy presence but as Leaves Fate's passing Wind shakes from Time's withered Tree? Ages pass o'er thee, thou art still the same! Yet as thou ow'st thy Birth to Man, who gives Thee form to witness for him, so shall he Outlive thy Dust, returning whence he came! 14. 'Tis thus our works outlast us; we go down To the rank dust from whence our bodies came, As tho' we were not, swifter than our own Frail Handyworks: and haply some dim Name, On old Tradition 's mumbling tongue told o'er, Hints at the wormeat Tale! Oh vanity Of vanities, if for an earthly End We live and toil, with wing that cannot fly Above this nether scene; 'tis then we blend Our Essence with the Dust, and fall to rise no more! MONEYSTANDARDS. What is our Meritmeasure on life's high And beaten Road, where with dustsoilÃ«d feet. The Sabbathless Herd crawls on with toil and sweat. In Mammonstrain? is it Humanity, Faith, Fatherlandslove, Wisdom, Piety, Or anyother quality that's meet To be revered within the soul's high seat, Where holy and eternal things alone Should be received? alas! it is not so; A Moneymeasure is the rule of worth; The earthborn, earthreturning, and the low, Of that which has no Type or Rule on Earth! We laugh at him who'd measure Heaven's bow With an Ellwand, yet with less ground for Mirth! ON THE APOLLO BELVEDERE. Thou art of Stone, yet soul too dwells in thee! A ray imparted by the mind that first Moulded thy shape of beauty, which has nursed The kindred Minds of those whom sympathy Makes of quick apprehension to descry Th' etherial essence, in all forms that burst From sense's narrow limits; from that worst And basest Thralldom of the outward Eye. Voice too dwells on those Marblelips for Ears Of ample faculty, not bounded to The narrow Language of Earth's hopes and fears; Wordless, except to him, whose hearing true And vast, has caught the Music of the spheres, By this interprets that and blends in one the two! ON READING TWO SONNETS ONE WRIT IN YOUTH, AND THE OTHER IN AGE, ON THE SAME SUBJECT. 1. Strange contrast! here the Painter, Youth, has been Busy with all Life's springtide forms and hues, Scattered as lavishly as Morningdews, And scarce more lastingâ there, hardby is seen The sour Critic, Age, with wrinkled brow, Cavilling at the Painter's phantasy, At disproportioned lights and shades, that throw And crowd all parts at once upon the Eye; That fill the foreground with a motley show, And leave the background furnished scantily. 2. And thou vain Caviller, art thou more wise, In thy selfwisdom, purchased at so dear, So costly a price, than he whose ready Tear Gush'd at a thought of beauty, and whose Eyes Gleamed with the undimmed light of Paradise, When of a Summereve, on his rapt Ear, The still sphcremusic from afar came clear As with a welcome? Oh! a deep truth lies In these first gushings of the unsoiled Heart, Thus struggling to remount to its springhead; Yea! a far deeper than the schoolmen's art Or Afteryears can teach us, when instead Of these high Efforts of our Divine Part, Earth's weight lies on us, 'till our Hearts be dead! 3. Till we possess but that which we can see And touch; and have no faith in anything Save what in Sense's Compass we can bring. Deeming all else a juggling mystery; As if the Slave to Doubt were really free! 'Tis then the nightingale in vain shall sing, He has no Lore for usâ the Poesy Of Earth is dead; no divine Echos ring! Then cavil not Oldage, that Youth in dreams Loves thus to dwell, by harsh reality Not yet enslaved; for that which only seems, May one Day be; and that which is, shall die And perish quite away! then when youth's beams Are spent, keep still the embers holily! 4. Thriceblessed memories of youth! sweet hours, O'er which e'en Age's timedimmed eyes might shed Some Joydrops still: for tho' the fountainhead Seem dry within our Hearts and all the flowers Be withered round its brink, yet are its powers But gathered back into the soul, not dead! And tho' no more in lavish stream it spread, Making the Earth as fair as Edensbowers, Yet gushes it within unfailingly; A well of living Waters, where we slake A heavenly thirst; ye days, from which we take A promise and a pledge that may not die, Be with us still, oh still for your sweet sake, Let us keep pure the shrine of Memory! MAN AND NATURE. 1 Thriceblessed Birds, for you the good And bounteous God has spread On every bough your daily food, 'Neath every leaf your Bed. 2 Unfailingly at Evening 's-close He calls ye to the nest, And o'er your peaceful slumber throws The shadow of his rest. 3 Ye who no vain selfwill oppose To Nature's sovereign will, Are, as at the first day's sweet close, Blest in obedience still! 4 The Grasshopper sleeps in the grass, And on him falls the Dew, While sunny visions o'er him pass, Steeped in his own Heartshue. 5 And duly with the goldwinged Morn, God wakes in Love again Each leafhid Bird, in heart reborn, With not one Touch of pain! 6 From his dank Wings he shakes the dew, Inheritor of bliss, And Eye and Ear to him renew All Joys that erst were his. 7 But man, vain Man, by other laws Than Nature gives is led, And Custom with his spirit wars, Until his heart be Dead. 8 The lengthening shades of Eve in vain Steal o'er the eye of day, And bid him from the toil refrain Of Life's soulsoiling way. 9 He lights his feverish, flickering Lamp, Tho' the blessed stars be shining, And still Earth's grasp his Soul doth cramp, And his thought is but repining! 10 And when the Sun's cloudsevering ray Its golden path doth trace, The Heartshade of the former day Is thrown o'er Nature's face. 11 The Bird is blesseder than he, For all he sees and hears Is redolent of Joy and Glee, And dimmed by no vain tears. 12 The Grasshopper leaps in the sun, The fountain gushes bright, And round its edge, the moss selfspun, Rejoices in its might, 13 Here all things love, and by their love, A common Joy they give, The stars by one same Law still move, And mutual Light receive. 14 The Neighbour-Flowers mix their breath, Sweetening the common air, The blooms selftwined in Nature's Wreath, By Union grow more fair. 15 But Man with man and self at War, Measures his days by strife, And the Light which cometh from afar, Fades off in this dim Life. 16 The Flowers blossom in their Spring And leave good seed behind, The Trees their fruits to ripeness bring, Ass Nature has designed. 17 But Man is withered ere his prime, He plucks his unripe Joys, And for life's coming wintertime No forethought he employs. 18 Or if he taste a Momentsjoy, Unlike the Bird's, it is But wrung from fancies that annoy, The spectre of past bliss. 19 It haunts him from the Days of yore, When like the Bird, He too, Sporting, Heartfree, with Bell and Flower, A Child of Nature grew. 20 And as these visions Memory gives, He frets in Wishes vain, Selfwarring with his thoughts he strives To feel a Boy again. 21 But gloomy Years rise up between The Present and the Past, And 'cross the Gulf, thro' dark mists seen, Youth's Vision fades fullfast; 22 Then on his Heart the Present throws The shadow of its gloom, And bars the Heavenslight that flows Upon us from the Tomb! TO A FRIEND. Oh if in Happiness thy lot be cast, Then turn a thankful Eye unto the Past, And ask whence it hath sprung: if other Heart Did aught of worth unto thine own impart By Commune and by Love, infusing thro' One soul, the life, the force, and truth of two, Like sunrays blent together: if there be One whom the Past makes dear to memory, Call up his soul that he thy bliss may share. Tho' from thine Eyes he's pass'd, still is he here, In the same Life with thee unfailingly! Still thro' the mist of Years, the loving Eye Dwells on the shapes of former Joys, still sees The fresh Dew of young Hope, which as it lay In your glad path, your feet would brush away In lovetimed step together, in your sport Of youthfull Fancies, or when holy thought, Sprang, sweet as flowers, from the root of bliss In its true Soil a selfcontented Heart. If of those Days the memory depart, Then thou must be an altered man indeed! And the sweet dew falls not where thy steps tread. But such thou canst not beâ then keep the thought Of those glad Days, within a Heart not wrought To selfishness by Time; may Life renew Unto thine Afterpath the blessed Dew Of early promise, making all around Thee fresh and joyous, as the gladsome sound Of Mountainstreams, and when upon the Brink Of a calm Grave thy foot is placed, then think Of him, whose bark Life's Tide hath swept from thine, As bound to one same Haven of sweet rest. THE RAINBOW. One End on Land, and one on Sea, The glorious Arch o'erspans the sky, Beneath the Earth laughs in fresh glee, And darkwinged Clouds before it fly! Bright Rainbow! tempestcradled form Of Beauty 'mid the passing storm, That hast thy Birth and death with it, The spirit by whose smile 'tis lit. Thou 'mid the darkling Clouds dost sit In calm untroubled loveliness, As perfect as tho' thou couldst dress Thy form in lasting glory, or Wert born of Peace, not 'mid the War Of Elements, in which thou livest, And to their strife a moral giv'st. How many times to man's dim Eye, 'Mid Heaven's gorgeous pageantry Of Tempestclouds hast thou appeared, A Peacepledge, by a World revered: By a relenting Maker placed, A token of high Wrath effaced! Still in thy primal Glory, thou Do'st span with manycolored Bow The Heavens above and Earth below. And all beneath thy cloudarch seems As beautiful, as Hopes young dreams! But thou, unlike to these, canst live While round thee Storm and Darkness strive, 'Mid these a bright reality While cold Experience bids them die! Thou art a Type of no mean power, Of Faith, who has like thee the dower Of calm, enduring Loveliness; Who o'er all griefs which here distress, All clouds of passing pain and care, That dim this lowbreathed nether air, Can shed her pure celestial light, Like thine, a Peacepledge everbright; And like thine too, her radiant form Shines brightest in the darkest storm! Thus Nature in her silent shows, Teaches us deeper truths than Science knows. Lovely to the sage's eye As to the Child's, who asks not why Thou spann'st the Heavens with thy Bow, Content to see, to feel and know Thy Glory, in his young delight. For all forms of Sense and Sight Which in Nature's realms we view, All are perfect, all are true; Whether with childhood's simple eye We gaze in awe and ecstacy, Or with proud Philosophy, Dealing in rule and theory, To God's high secrets we aspire, And the Â«first causeÂ» of things enquire! Rainbow! be thou still to me A Beauty and a Mystery, And when mine Eyes agedim shall grow, Still shine thou as of yore, e'en so As in my boyish Days, a sign, A Something wondrous and Divine, Where Faith may fitly exercise Her aspirations, and uprise From these vain, bounded shows of Time, Unto thy vast and ampler clime; For from the Heavensbosom thou With Heavenspeace art poured below: Building thy arch of Cloud and Rain, The sunshine's child, then lost again, When thou hast stamped upon the storm The Impress of thy radiant form: 'Mid elements of passing strife, The symbol of a happier life. A second Rainbow 'mid the Storm Unfolds the shadow of thy form, 'Tis gone, and like a Soul set free From Earthliness, thy Shape we see Melting into Eternity! SEASUNSETSCENE. How strange yon' Cloud! round whose more solid height, Tho' Cloud itself, like Cloudlets, vapors grey Are curling, gilded with the setting ray. Yon' rosy wave, now seen, now lost to sight, Blends with a thousand Playmates, each more bright And lovely than his fellow: how they play Whelplike, on their vast parent's Bosom! Day Is melting gorgeous, with rainbowlight, From the far West, and sober Evening, Like Thought on some high Pageantry's Fastfleeting splendors watching, on slow wing Advances unobserved athawrt the skies, With surer conquest. Lo! the Blazoning Of Hand Divine fades off, the Glory dies! Gone, like a Dream; snatched from my wondering Eyes, As Nature were too rich to care for such a Thing! WEALTHCOVETERS. Better to be a savage, than of these Selfseeking, grovelling, moneymaking worms, These Goldwebweavers, who in all their forms, Are the same Earthgrubs still: the Savage sees And owns a higher Power in the breeze That sweeps o'er his Turfcot, and to the storms He hearks with holy awe: a soul informs His breast, ethereal tenant! and sets free His fancies from Earth's dust and darkness, by The inborn Majesty of Mind, altho' Untaughtâ he errs from ignorance; not so, Ye Allinstructed, ye whose lives belie Your proud Enlightenment; ye learn to know Evil from Good, yet knowledge to worst ends apply! SUGGESTED BY THE FIRST FRENCH REVOLUTION. â There are Occasions, When Cowards-selves fling off their Nothingness, And giantize their Thoughts unto the Shape And Temper of the Times, and in their own Despite become the Instruments of Fate; Swelled into Heroes, that pass muster with The easygullÃ«d Multitude, which feeds Upon the Garbage of Opinion; and Yet afterall, they're but Strawsubstitutes, Just patched up for the Nonce, to fool the Herd, Which looks but at the Surface, and if that But glitters, there it points its Finger, there Its Shouts and Praises follow â what, shall then Men of real Mark and Likelihood play false Unto themselves, when ripe Occasion smiles And beckons onward to the Goal? no! let Them match the Time: the Tide must at the Full Be taken, else they will be left upon The strand to rot: and if the Good hold back, When selfish men and bad would grasp the Helm, The vessel of the State must perish, and Its goodly Freight be lost unto Mankind. Then, Goodmen, stand ye forward: for the Hearths Of your dear Homes, and for the Altar of Your God, all Sacrifice is littleâ who For Life would lose what makes Life liveable? Had God held back, in what state should we be E'en at this moment? and if he thus gave His Son, his spirit, his ownself, shall we Grudge him a little Dust and Dross of Earth? And that too for our Good alone: then keep Not back: with Voice and Hand uphold the Right; Even a Woman, Sickman, or a Child, Can speak the Right, and where they do so, God Speaks by them! and, when He speaks, e'en the Dumb Have Ears to understand Him! and if all Together speak, who shall withstand the Voice Of God himself-for that which all men feel And speak, that is the Feeling, is the Voice, Of God himself! RAILROADTRAVELLING. [1.] What boot your windswift Railroads? will ye reach Your journeysend the quicker for such things? Tho' ye should leave behind the Eagleswings, Ye lag not less upon that way, which each And all must tread: ye Earthsouls who would teach That Nationswealth lies but in that which brings Increase of Gold aud Ledger-reckonings! 'Tis but disease and weakness which ye preach; What strength is, ye know notâ 'tis not in Nerve, In Walls, or Gold, or Numbers, for all these Are of the Earth and earthly, nor deserve The name of strength, which like the sap in trees, Grows inwardly, and is the fountainhead, Whence Life, Power, Beauty flow thro' forms else dead! 2. True strength is thisâ To be the foremost still Where Good is to be done, where Wrong the last. To trespass not, however firm and fast Our power may seem â Strength lives most in pure will, In love of lofty things, in hate of ill: Tis still to foster what within thou hast Of Heavenborn, and in that mould to cast All this life's forms; so when Time shall fulfill His course, thy Handyworks in spite of him, May shed a light which he in vain would dim. This is true strength, which not on outward things E'er leans for Aid, nor owes unto the whim Of Chance Allegiance; but with it brings Power not granted to the Thrones of kings! 3. What boot your railways? 'tis but Time and Space Both earthly things, and for the body's sake Ye thus curtailâ but can your vain skill make A shorter, easier path to God's high Grace? Or can ye mend one jot the Spirit's pace? The soul hath wings, and journeys it can take Where railways vanish in its glorious wake, And Earth itself grows but a speck, a base And cloudlike speck, in Faith's widereaching Sky! Then while these Earthbesotted deem they fly, Wrapt in the Dust of their own nothingness And saving Time to lose Eternity, Let us not stoop to such unworthiness But consciously our heritage possess. TO MILTON. Milton! thine age was allunworthy thee, And thy most godlike worth but stung the hate Of conscious baseness: who would purge a state Form slavery's deep leprosy, must be Martyr himself to those he seeks to free! Of the God-Martyr know ye not the fate? What happier lot on earthborn Hopes should wait? Who that has sown in such a soil may see The harvest ripen to his hand! but thou Sought'st not reward or harvest; thou alone In the Lord's Field didst labour, there to sow The Good Seed far and near; and toiling on, Still in thy great Taskmaster's Eye, didst show Sublime Example, how true Fame is won, Transfigured by the Sweat upon thy Brow! EVENINGTHOUGHTS. Awake my soul! not silent shouldst thou be, When all around is adoration â Hark! The Vesperhymn of Evening, rises soft, And soulawaking from the ends of Earth; From the four quarters of the Winds, from all That has a sense, and where is that has not, From yon' bright Stars, down to the Glowworm here, Of thee, allbounteous, Eternal God, Allseeing eye, that lookÃ«st in thy Love Over all shapes and modes of Being; thou That hallowest the meanest thing on Earth, With signs and tokens of a Wisdom, which, As snatches of sweet harmony suggest The perfect Whole, of which they are but parts, Flashes upon our dark and groping sense Convictions high, and rays of purest Light! Oh! let thy blessing be upon me now And evermore; and as this dew descends From heavÃ«n, fresh on these sweet flowers here Bowed gently down to Earth, as if in Prayer, In still Thanksgiving; tho' they have no Tongue, Yet in their silence far more eloquent Than Solomon, thus teaching to proud man, A lesson of sublime humility! They wait for their refreshment, if to day It come not, yet to morrow 't will: and if Not then, whene'er it be, 't will be in Â«HisÂ» Good season, fittest, wisest, best! Oh thus Then let the spiritsdew descend on me, Awaiting meekly, whether it may be, The third hour or the ninth; for oft it most Falls on us when we least expect it, as On these sleepfolded Flowersâ let but Faith Uphold us then, and it will never fail! For God forsakes not tho' He tests and tries His true Heartworshippers; when least they deem, He's with them, and within them, and all round; Oft in the windstirred Leaf, the meanest Flower That springs beneath our feet, he speaks unto The Heart that loves him, while th' Incredulous Hears but the common wind, sees but a flower, A little painted flower 'neath his feet, And hears no oracle that tells of Good, Of Selfcontent, and Peace, and Blessedness Existing 'neath the troublous, changeful form Of outward things, as at the Ocean's Heart Sleeps waveless Calm, while storms the surface shake; Of outward things, through which the Eye of faith Alone can pierce unto the Centretruth, Where beats the soul of Harmony and Love, Of which our own are but pulsations, still Stronger or weakerunisoned, as from, Or to, our Being's End and Aim we move; Concentric or eccentric, as the small Within the greater wheel of this vast sphere, With which we are bound up in one wise scheme Of endless and indissoluble being! Now Eve has strewn her starryskirted robe Over the deepblue heavens: the Daygod, Westering, still lingers as in love to take Another glance at this fair world, of which He is the Quickener, ere once more on His Oceanpillow, he reclines his Head, Round which, backgathering from the Ends of Earth, His Daybeams throng, their service duly done, And mantle like a Halo o'er his Brow; E'en as a Goodman's Gooddeeds gather from The Past, to witness for him when in Bliss! All their Daymissions of fruitripening power, Of harvestspeeding, juiceenriching Warmth, Plumping the Hazel, and the Grape, until It grow transparent, full of liquid Light; Swelling the sunbaked fruitrinds, 'till they ooze Their luscious nectardrops, whereof the Bee Makes his Lovehoney, all is duly done; And now, like faithful servants homereturn'd, They join their source, unwearied, unappeased, By this their course of Good, wherein they toil, If pleasure be to toil, to work the praise Of Him, who wreathed them round the sun's bright brow. Cloudcanopied upon Creation's dawn: Of Him, whose stilly Spirit to their Task Examples them, unwearied like themselves, And silent as the Flower of the Field! Who bade them cheer the hearts and eyes of all That walk on this fair Earth, upright or prone. Some have been gilding o'er with prayed-for ray The dungeonfloor, where in his clanking chains The prisoner sits, and feels his heart grow chill, 'Till that glad beam has entered, and he lives To hope once more, or dream of his far home, The sunny homescenes where he drew the breath Of Liberty and Youth; of Liberty To be no more, and Youth which is a Dream! And that worst Loss of all, the selfcontent, Which harsh Laws, punishing the crimes they make, By blindfold Justice sanctioned, and his own Frail passions have destroyed, regainable By Faith alone! Some too have been afar, Gilding the shipless Sea's remotest wave, For nothing is too low, too far, too small, For the allgrasping Love of God; nor deem That Sunbeams shine but for the Eyes of Man, But for all things alike, of which the least Is duly cared for; others too have been Warming the seasdepths with their cavehid spawn Of dormant Life; and others kindling up The earthembowelled fires, from whose Womb The Earthquake springs; some on the Mountaintops, Melting the snows of Ages, till they flow With harvestquickening wave to distant lands; Others, seedripening, floweropening Beams, Have fanned the Beeswing as he floated in The orient light! some too have dived beneath The fruitfulbowelled Earth, and stirred within Her womb the veinÃ«d ores, which, with slow toil, Man brings to day, and oft abuses to His unproportioned Ends, far from the use, To which his Maker framed them: some again Have cheered the thornless Deathbed, where, in Peace, A Goodman offers up his soul to God Hoping Salvation. âNow from every Clime, Each clime of Earth, Air, Sea, they speed, like thoughts Harmonious blending with the centrethought Of Truth, Eternal, Indivisible, Whereof they are diverging Rays â now is The hour, when Faith can hear such sounds as stole On our first Parents at Day'sclose, amid The choral groves of Eden, while they were Yet pure in deed and thought, and angelguests Sat at their board, or chaunted allnightlong Their common Maker's praise: so writes the Bard, In whom Faith and Imagination were Twin Eaglewings, that bore his daring soul Up to the Heaven of Heavens, far beyond The Reach of Pegasean Flight â methinks Invisible Beings fan me with their Wings, And as they pass, make Music to mine ear, Bearing me tidings of a happier Land, Where my Hopes only enter: on all sides, Above, around, are beings who subserve The One Eternal, and with them I join A mortal voice indeed, yet tuned unto Immortal thoughts, and thus invoke their aid. Allmother Earth, whose child I am, and ye Spirits that track the earthroundgirdingbelt Of Oceanwaves, which grasp this bounded World, As Faith would grasp Eternity; and ye That wake sweet Echo on the printless sands, Which have been, and may be again, the shores Of mighty Empires, unto which the wave's Shipcradling bosom wafts in foamy scorn The conquestwingÃ«d Fleets, that proudly bear The spoils of Nations, oft stormstrewn by thee, Thou azurebrowed and timeunchangÃ«d Main, When at the Eternal's Voice thou puttest forth Thy Might, and scarce a Bubble marks their Grave. These Shores, nightmantled, which are now all left, A Playground unto you and yoursâ and ye, That where the Rainbow rests do love to quaff The Dewwine fresh from out the Flowercups, One Drop of which mixed with the Wildbee's mead, 'Gives him a summertide of Bliss; and ye Ye hilltophaunting Nymphs, ye seacave Fays, That make the Echos hoarse with answering, And ye, the mossy Fountainguardians, That woo bright Moombeams to your chosen spring, To fresh the wave for favoured Poetslip, Ye too, Oakelves, Woodfays, and Wildheathsprites, That fright the Traveller with harmless Pranks; And ye that on the moonkissed Midnightwave Dance to its soullike Motion with young Glee; Airsprites, that on the Setsunsdownslopebeam, Chace the goldfeathered Foambirds, as they dip Their snowplumed Wings amid the seething brine, Less white than they! and ye, wavecradled tribes, Innumerous as motes, that down the West Float in the glorious suntrack as he sinks, Anthemed by spherematemusic, to far worlds Lightbearing orb: tuning the harmonies Of Worlds, that starrÃ«d round his Gloryzone, Move at his voice and bidding, and bear on The Seasons and their Changes to far Lands, With Interchange of good and ill, of light And darkness; weaving on their mystic course The manymeshÃ«d fatewoof: the birthhour Of kingdoms, framed from oldworld Fragments, and The Fall of Thrones, and Darkening of suns And systems, thro' immeasurable space! Ye Spirits, one and all, ye I invoke, With voice of adoration: for with ye The Soul hath its communion; ye bring To the worldwearied spirit thoughts of peace, And tidings of a faroff Home, of peace, Beneath these Surfacechanges, calm and deep, Subsisting in the universal Heart Of which our own Heart is a pulse, tho' oft It beat with feverish wishes and vain Fears, Discordant from its Source and End; oh yes! Spirits as ye, tho' cooped in this Clayhouse, We are as thoughtunlimited as ye, Tho' spacebound far on this side of our hopes; And in such viewless Intercourse we have Yearnings, Heartyearnings, to be e'en as ye, Free o' the Air, Earth, Ocean, as that Thought Which is undying in us; in whose Might, Tho' not yet freed, we still can mix with ye, And to the Mindseye body forth your shapes, Allviewless tho' ye be: for spirit yearns Tow'rds Spirit, and are we not Spirits too? Ye are but parts as we are even now Of that allseeing, wise Intelligence, Unborn, Undying, Allencompassing, Coliving wth each living thing wherein A Soulspark kindles, or a hope is felt, For Something better than the passing shows Of this vain Timescene, which is but a Dream, Tho' it seem as if real, for still we sleep! Hear me, ye spirits, let my young voice be Heard in your Mornthanksgivings, in your Hymns Of Vespervoices which along the Leaves, The dewmoist leaves pass to Eternity; Whenever on the one eternal God Ye call in wordless prayer, let my Voice too Mingle with yours, not alldiscordantly; Whether above the orient wave of Light, Dancing, ye hymn the coming Daygod on, Or o'er the midnightdeeps, when all is still, Save the wave whispering his playmatewave Spheremusicsecrets, and on widespread Wing Sits Heavenly Meditation, brooding o'er, Dovelike, the Universe, your voices lift Their Undersong of neverwearied praise, To the allbounteous Giver of all Good! Oh in whatever Place, whatever Time, At Morn, or dewy Eve, or Middayheat, On land or sea or air, oh let my voice Be heard with yours, and not unworthily, Ethereal tho' ye be: for in such hymn, The meanest voice is tuned by Love and Faith, And cannot be discordant tunÃ«d thus! Yet once more for another boon I ask; When in the weekday fret, and strife of this Dark World, my spirit sinks, Oh then bring back Upon your unseen Wings, the Dews of youth, The Freshness of the Heart, the eversweet, The pure imaginings of youth, which keep The soul from blight, and are as a fresh spring Of Life, amid the desert of this World! ON LOVE. 1 Oh! God, how wondrous are thy works, how vast Thy Bounty to ungrateful man â thy Love, The bright Horizon, which domes over Past, Present and Future! in which all Things move And breatheâ but most man's Heart, which as the Dove Should be, yet like the fabled vulture, oft Preys on itselfâ the Flowers in the Grove, The starry Spheres on highâ all Beauty soft- -Ly in Love's smile is born, on Earth and up aloft! 2 Thou Ether of the Universal Heart; Sole Atmosphere in which its Pulses beat; Thou steep'st with golden Light of Heav'n each Part Of manyfeatured Lifeâthy Divine Heat Gives to the Human Breast the Touch of sweet Affections, till man's Voice seem as a Tone Of thine own Lipsâ the Dayseye at thy Feet Thou bend'st thy meeklysublime Eyes upon, For nought is low to theeâ the highest's thou alone! 3 Oh Love! Love! Love! thus would my soul run on, Repeating for awhile that name of thine, Entoiled in Thoughtwoofs, hard to be unspun; Where thousand Beautythreads entangled twine Their Irismeshes, like the silkworm's shrine Selfwove; Oh Love, I know not where or how Thy praises to begin, such awe is mine; Oh! let the spirit be upon me now Of all I love, that all our souls as one may grow! 4 How shall I paint thee? seated with a few, A few dear hearts around some homefireside, Far from the world's brute Uproar, and all view Of Discontent, and selfexalted Pride, Who cannot find in all life's circuit wide, The bliss which lies unheeded at their feet; Or shall I paint thee, as thou lovest to hide Thy flame within some virginheart, most meet, And fit receptacle for element so sweet? 5 Or with a baby cradled on thy breast, And drinking from one fount both Love and Life; Or watching o'er the dreamdisturbÃ«d rest Of some dear head; or gathering for the hive Of worlddespisÃ«d Wisdom, truths that give The soul its skywardwings; or when thou bow'st, While Nations with selfscourging Evil strive, Thy head, like Him of old, true to the last, A Freewillbloodatonement for crimes long since past! 6 Oh Love! thou art the spirit's dailybread, The heavensent Manna in this barren Earth; But likest that whereon God's people fed, Art given but to Faith; thou hast no worth For hearts wherein earthgrovelling Thoughts have birth. These thou wilt nourish not; celestial food Is not for impure lips; but in the Dearth Of meaner joys thou com'st with loftiest mood, And by selfsacrifice thou mak'st man half a God! 7 TwiceblessÃ«d art thou, Love, for thou dost bless, Like Mercy, him who gives and him who takes; Joyfountain everfull, which more or less Knows not, nor fears; and he who thereat slakes A heavenly thirst, and of its waters makes His soul's daydrink, his lips shall never more Of impure sources taste; of vain heartaches, And false Excitement, leaving us still poor, With wasted feelings which have fed no produce sure. 8 He in whom Love has worked no holy change, No soulexpansion and no Impulse high, He has not loved; for Love doth allestrange Itself from Earth; and to the inner eye It gives o'er all life's forms new mastery, To read aright their meanings, and to bind Them into one strong chain, not linked awry, By passion, prejudice, and yearnings blind But surely blended by joint-warmth of heart and mind. 9 With Bodypleasures Love hath nought to do, But as these fade he grows to angelsize, And heavenly Halos mantle o'er his brow; The light he loves is in his loved ones eyes; The food he loves, nor cloys, nor with Earth dies; Heartcommune and soulintercourse, whereby He beautifies all forms, and for the skies Moulds all life's elements, imparting high And holiest uses even unto things that die! 10 He breaks no law! for Love itself is Law! And of all Law the holy guarantee; For where Love is not, there the passions war Against each other, for brief mastery; A state divided 'gainst itself no high And holy end attains; but Love doth bind All faculties in blessed unity, Giving them force and strength; no Impulse blind, But a calm, during energy of heart and mind; 11 'Mid no vain tumult of the passions He E'er condescends to dwell; for ever where Such idle conflict is, true Liberty Exists not; and the man whose soul doth bear Such Elements of discord, hath no share Of Love's calm Essence: he is still the slave Of earthly hopes and fears; his desires are Still born of dust, and destined for the grave, Their End is barrenness; for what can passion have 12 To do with during Things? 'tis of the clay, And of the body and with them it dies, Killed by attainment; a false feverish ray That cleanses not from Earth's impurities The soul, and with a brighter flame doth rise The less of these there be, but e'en with these Its gross materials dies out, and lies Spent in the dust with them; but Love is Peace, For where he rules the heart, all warring passions cease! 13 Being himself Divine, he makes Divine All that he touches: being Heavenly He maketh Heavenly, and can refine Earth's brute materials, can purify And perfect to its end each faculty; In him they have a conscious being to High Offices; for he can cleanse the Eye, Enlarge the ear, and breathe a spirit new Into the heart, whence all things take his own bright hue! 14 Nor wonder, that thro' him all faculties Grow perfect, since he is himself alone The source of all Perfection; fountains rise Brackish or sweet as is their source; no tone Of music hath its charm, no scene can own Its proper spell; no poesy is sweet; No Joy to full Completion e'er hath grown, No unheard melody the ear can greet, No woodsward echo to the trip of Fairyfeet, 15 No babbling stream speak music, and no song Of bird be felt as nature's minstrelsy; No wisdom to the hivÃ«d lore belong Of Poet or Philosopher, no sky Be filled with Fancy's mystic Pageantry; No beauty live to eye or ear, until Love has embodied our whole Destiny And Being in his shape; till Power and Will, Proportioned perfectly, their genuine task fulfill! 16 For Love is life; and where Love is not, there Is neither happiness nor life; for He Who loves not, breathes but this vile Body's Air, As a Brutebeast; for him what can life's tree But Ashesfruit produce, what can he be, Poor selfcursed wretch, who eats in Loneliness Unblessed meals, but brutelike; who can see No worthier sight than his own nothingness, Who, with his eye still on himself, grows daily less, 17 Less like that noble being he was made By God to be; until disfigured quite, Each divine lineament begins to fade, His Maker's image lost, he sinks outright Into the Brute, from that most glorious height Which Love and Virtue should have raised him to. But Love can only perfect; like the light, It shows all things in their own proper hue, For Love and Truth are twins and up together grew! 18 Nor can Love sin, for then would he belie His nature, which is to fulfill, not break All Law, all Duty; Being from the sky, He is eternal, and tho' Suffering wreak Its worst ills on him, never can it shake, But like the winds with trees, it strengthens more And more his deepset roots, which ever take Downward their course towards Earth's contrepower, And rest firm fixed within allmighty Nature's core! 19 And Love is calm, because immoveable; And like the seasdepths, far too deep to be Disturbed and shaken by the stir and swell Of outward accident; for as the sea Is still below, while o'er the surface flee The noisy winds in passing uproar, so Is Love within himself from all change free, Save what from his own calm deep depths may flow, Life's outward forms may change, the soul no change can know! 20 Love seeks not, neither likes disguise; for how Can he conceal that which he is, or be Other than what he is; that which is show, Not heartfelt, may be wrapped in mystery, And change its Proteusshape unto the eye Each moment; Fancy's wild Cameleonbirth, Which as opinions change their hue, doth die Into another colour; but Love's worth, From its ownself takes form, not frail like those of Earth! 21 For Love is not a passion; not a part Of Being, but our Being's self; and ne'er, Save in the still, calm union of heart And mind and sense, is Love; an atmosphere, Wherein we breathe a more serene and clear And holy breathing; how then can he hide Himself, or cease in each least act to bear The mark of what he is; He has too wide, Too ample Being far, in vain forms to abide! 22 He dwells with Lowliness and Modesty; For loving all things, how can he be proud? And being truly Great unchangingly, His spirit never from its height has bowed Unto the Littleness of Pride, endowed With conscious worth, he labours but to be That which he seems; and 'mid the selfish Crowd Moves calmly on in his own majesty, Returning whence He came, from soil and contact free! DRAMATIC SCENES. The Reader must conceive a Man of Education and refined Feelings, who has ruined himself by Gambling, and has fallen into the Hands of a Set of designing Villains Who work upon him in every Way, and take Advantage of his weak Points: his Dread of Shame, and the Impossibility of paying the Gamingdebt, combined With accidental Circumstances, lead him to murder the Person to whom he owes the Money: as is often the case, the exaggerated Estimation of one Good, mere Reputation, And the Desire to maintain that, leads him into the Violation of a tenfold higher Duty, and produces the Loss of a tenfold greater Good: he is introduced to the Reader, a short Time after the Murder, and is represented as roused from a feverish Sleep, into which he has fallen after returning from the Gamingtable: the Idea of the Thunderclap was suggested to me by my own Feelings on being awakened by the most fearful Peal I ever heard, and the Thought immediately occurred to me, of what its Effect would have been on a guilty, bloodstained and dreamscared Mind. SCENE I.?? A Bedroom; Storm heard without. Edward, the Gambler, lyeing on the Bed, on which he has thrown himself after Midnight, in a state of halfdrunkenness, to which he is accustomed in order to drown his Thoughts; starts up, halfasleep, at the Thunderclap. EDWARD. O God! Hell; furies; help, or â oh! oh! oh! (He sees himself in a glass, by the lightningsflash and starts back aghast). 'Tis there, there still, with fixed and glassy Eye, Looking damnation, as it meant to say, Down, down to Hellâ ha, ha, ha, (hysterically) fool, idiot, 'twas but An idle Dream â an idle dream! e'en so; And yet so like the life that I could swear It real; methought I was annihilated, and The warm, fresh, current of the blood within My Heart was froze â that fearful thunderclap! Plunging so madly thro' the womb of Night, As it would rend the thickest veil of crime And mystery, that with a blacker Night, Hideth Man's Heart, in vain â Methought the Voice of the Eternal God (Shuddering and glancing fearfully round.) Awoke my Soul, as from the cold, cold Grave, And the vast fabric of this mighty Globe, Like to a toppling Tower, o'erpoisÃ«d by The weight of boundless guilt, was swept away Into th' abyss of dread Eternity, And sounds as of the damned rang in my Ears! Ha, ha, (hysteric Laugh, and echo): the voice of the Eternal God! Ha, ha; who laughs?â Methinks the very walls Jabber in mockery; fool, fool, 'twas but The echo of thy Voice, that thus unmans Thy Cowardspirit like a sickly Girl O'ermastered by her fears â I ne'er believed in God, and will not now When I've outgrown these cradlefancies, and Know myself Man. I trembled not, nor shrank At my own shadow, when I did it, no! My Heart beat true, and my firm Hand was prompt To second Head and Heart: for what then now Should I prove false unto myself, when nought Is near to harm?â a Thunderclap forsooth, A little Stir up in the Air, that long Ago has melted into Emptiness, And a wild dream? am I not still myself? Do I not love myself? are Head and Heart Forsooth turned traitors to a common cause, And to themselves? pah! mere fooleries and fumes Of th' o'ernight's supperâ and yet 'tis most strange, I seem no longer Master of myself, But in myself a mightier than myself, Seems in my own despite, as tho'I were A struggling Infant in a Giant's grasp, To force me on unto the very face And front of my offending, and to strip The veil from off my Eyes, bidding me see And loathe myselfâ Oh Conscience! Conscience! There is more in that word than meets the Ear. The grinning Devil, Sophistry, can dupe Full well th'Intention, but when once 'tis done, The veil is rent, and naked stands the Truth; Before the deed Temptation's magic touch Can gild the leaden hue of blackest crime, And clothe the withered skeleton of cold, Heartsickening disappointment with the shape And form of ripe fruition â Fool, fool, fool, The sport of idle thoughts, that bubblelike, Toss thee upon a sea of doubt, despair: The sickly hue of fancy, long indulged, Will change Man's resolution to a dream. There is no God; and guilt is but the name With which the coward speciously conceals His lack of Soul; or if there be a God That thus o'erlooks the World, and guilt be guilt, Why has the Thunderclap that's spent in air, Not crushed me with his vengeance, as it should, If he were provident of Right or Wrong, And not all impotent to punish? fool! I laugh to think how great a fool I've been For nothing; but I'm now myself again. Yet would I sleep no moreâ how a mere nought Can all unhinge the firmset mind of Man, And fling him from his centre, like a star Cast from its orbit, in an airy maze Of baseless and unending doubts! enough, Would it were day; and yet the Day is scarce More sweet to me than Night; for then, methinks, The prying Eye of every idiot can Unlock my Heart, and every casual word That folly utters seems to point the way To that which I would wrap in utter Night. My fellowmen are prying fiends, and hate Doth seem to dog my steps where'er I turn, While sleep is but another name for Hell! Oh I could wish a wish, and I would give (breaks short) What? fool, idiot! once more a greater fool Than ever, 'tis too late! who says so? who? The fiend, the fiend, there, there he stands for aye Grinning damnation; ha, ha, ha;â O God! footstepsâ discoveredâ curse on't, who comes? (Gasping and leaning on a chair; enters his sister with a light, who has heard him paceing up and down, she appears in Undress.) SISTER SPEAKS. Dear brother! at this hour, and dressed? your looks Are haggard and distractedâ oh what ails you? Come tell meâ let us have no secrets now I pray; you know I love you, do I not? EDWARD SPEAKS. Yes, sister, and such love as yours might well Demand a greater sacrifice; but still Another time, dear, we will talk of that Which now disturbs my Mind. I came to rest, OverfatiguÃ«d with a Day of toil, And layd me down undressed; but the worn Mind, When o'erexcited by its fretting thoughts, Rests not itself, nor lets the body rest. This, with the jarring storm, has quite untuned My Spirit's harmony, of which the strings Are rudely fingered by a thousand wild, Discordant fancies, and no less a hand Than thine can set it right again. (He walks away from her, and speaks apart, muttering to himself.) EDWARD SPEAKS. She seems An Angel winged from Heaven, to awake AccursÃ«d thoughts of what I was; all peace And beauty, like the Iris arching o'er The tortured waters of the Cataract, Hurled down into their selfsought Hell, From Virtue's Eminence, regainless now And evermoreâ how misery delights In the superfluous luxury at times Of idle Metaphor, and things that were Emblems of peace and purity, in days Of innocence, when the Mind tainted grows, Become the Types of deep damnation! thus The Heart turns round upon itself, and all That education, taste, or fancy yield, Give but a keener sense of Misery; And the stern stubborness of Guilt dissolves, Like a scarceformÃ«d snowflake, with one glance Of Virtue's Eye. I dare not look at her, Lest she should read the Villain that I am; I can bear all but pity, the cold hate And scorn of Man but rouse my energy, And sting me to defiance, but pity, Like the invisible dew, melts all the heart Into a woman's mood of suppleness. I scarce know whether I be in myself, Or nightmared still. â (He draws near, takes her hand, and speaks aloud.) Sister, how fair this hand, From Spot or Speck quite free! look now at this. Seest thou nought on it?â 'tis no more the same As that, with which in early Infancy I culled for thee the Flowers that we loved! (He shrinks from her touch, and lets her hand drop. Then starts aside and speaks apart, while she leans on a Chair and watches him in Astonishment.) Avaunt, thou Fiend of lieing memory! Why wilt thou rack my Heart beyond all Power Of Man's Endurance? I was innocent, As the unborn babe, and now black, black as Hell! My life has but two epochs, two dread points Of dire collision, and my heart between Is ground to dust with agony; I am; I was â but there is still a dread, to be, From which my glance shrinks withered up, as tho' The nerve were firetouched: the Hell to come, Tho' blacker than the hell of now 'tis not, Is yet more dread in apprehension; thus E'en in this life our crimes themselves do scourge, And in the next vengeance exacts her due. Thus the foul fiend doth mould us to his will, Making us tools unto ourselves and him, And is the first to turn and taunt us with The crime he prompted to! as if 'twere not Enough to sin, but we must foolÃ«d be, E'en in the depth of our most boasted lore, Like shallow novices, and bear the scorn Of sneering fiends; and last, yet worst of all, Feel that we've laid the snare for our own feet, And own it just; while yet we curse the chance, The chance! my heart belies the empty word: There's more of Providence in this same chance; Than my fears dare to credit: if 'twere chance, And Guilt were but an idle name, why then To kill a cat should wake as much remorse, As to outrage in Man the Deity Who stamped him in his Image! oh that thought Should ever thus be at the Heels of action, Damning with Afteradmonition still, Like sickness after surfeit! But enough; Peace for the present thou most fearful voice, That ringest like a sentence in my ear, And leave me master of myself once more. Avaunt! (Aloud, and rousing himself at last as his Sister, who has been watching him at a distance in wonder and terror, and has in vain accosted him several times, ultimately succeeds in calling his attention.) â His Sister clasping him. Speak, speak, my dearest Edward, speak, Say but one word, to break this dreadful, deep, Inexplicable mystery, which weighs Like death upon one. EDWARD. âNay, my dearest Girl, Be but a moment calm, and all is well; I did but wander. I felt ill: sick, sick, Here at the heartâ But now 'tis gone, 'tis gone, And I am still thine own, own Edward; too, Too happy in so kind a Sister. SISTER. Oh Edward, Your words have more than meet the Ear, and like Some straynote of a broken tune, they wake In the stirred heart a throng of blended thoughts, Wild and confused, yet meaning much, and full Of feelings which we cannot body forth, Whose vagueness tortures the racked breast the more. For the last moment I have watched thy face, (While thy Lips moved, and muttered broken words) Varying each instant, like a cloudy Day, Now dark, now still, now allobscured, now wrung And writhing, as each separate Sinew had An individual Lifeâ while from thine eye Thoughts flashed, like lightninggleams, which vaguely hint At the fierce elements within, that will Not vent themselves, yet cannot allconceal Their wild intensityâ nay dearest, nay Such griefs as these do weigh too heavy for A single Breast, let me but share a part, And we shall both be happier.â EDWARD. It may Not be; thou know'st not what thou ask'st, yet still I'll think upon it, and meanwhile, adieu, I am too worn for further converse, and Would fain repose awhile â once more farewell. (She departs, and he looks after her.) She's gone! the Past, the innocent Past, awhile Like a sweet vision, rose before my eyes, As she stood by me; but dread solitude, Like a chill deathshroud, wraps my soul once more. My Heart is stirred: the thoughts of early days Are on me, and I fain would pray â Â«O GodÂ» â (Kneels, then breaks short.) I cannot; how should I extend to Him, These bloodstained hands in prayer? where find The words of Grace, when Hell is in my breast? If I should say, Â«our Father which art in Heaven,Â» I call down Vengeance on myself; if thus, Â«Do unto others as thou wouldst be done Unto.Â» I do pronounce on mine own head, Damnation everlasting: in mine ear A voice is ringing like a damnÃ«d knell, And it saith Â«Blood doth cry up unto Heaven,Â» Â«It will not sink into the Earth.Â» But hark! My God! what noise is that upon the stairs? 'Tis as of many feet! if it should be? Theâ theâ my Heart misgives me sadly; is There no escape? this Window is too high. (goes to the Window.) A hand is on the Doorlock! God in Heaven! 'Tis they! a Deathdamp gathers on my brow; Oh that I could now shrink up into nought. (Leans on a Chairback, looking in terrorstruck Expectation at the Door, which opens, and four Policeofficers armed, enter.) FIRST POLICEOFFICER. Look to the Door that he escapes not. SECOND POLICEOFFICER, DRAWING OUT A POLICEWARRANT. You are my Prisoner, Sir. EDWARD. Upon what charge? (violently agitated.) SECOND POLICEOFFICER. Neither more nor less than: Murder! (Edward sinks into a chair, while the Officers handcuff him, without resistance, he being quite stupified; his Mother and Sister rush into the room only halfdressed, it being very early morning.) THE MOTHER. Almighty God! what do I see with these Old, feeble Eyes? am I reserved for this? What has he done; how called down on his Head The vengeance of the Laws? a playdebt, some Unhappy brawl, or public Misdemeanour? Speak, say what he has done, thus to disgrace My grey old Hairs? speak, gentlemen, I pray ye; EDWARD (whispering in agony.) Say debtâ brawl â anything, but that one word. For her sake then, if not for mine. THIRD OFFICER. Madam, we Do but our Duty, tho' unwillingly. MOTHER. But, but, kind gentlemen, in mercy speak; Break not my Heart, I will pay all I have To bail him, are ye sure that there is no Mistake? let pity for these old grey Hairs Move yeâye too have Mothers! ye have sons! Feel for them then in me! (all keep a dead silence.) MOTHER. â Will no one speak? SECOND POLICEOFFICER. Madam, we feel for you, but we must do Our Dutyâ Bail is here impossible! (His sister hearing this, faints, remenbering her conversation just before with him, and feeling all her suspicions confirmed. In the confusion, while two of the Officers raise her into a Chair, and the two others hold the Prisoner, his Mother seizes the Warrant on the Table, and with a Horrorshriek, reads Â«On a charge of Murder!Â» And drops senseless: various domesticks make their appearance, and as the scene drops, he is led out.) SCENE the SECOND. EDWARD waking on his Strawpallet in a Prisoncellâ alone. I have no rest, no peace by Day or Night; Dream crowds on dream, thought presses upon thought, Urging each others heels to madnessâ why Then do I drag this everlengthening Chain Of Misery, to which each passing Day, CursÃ«d Artificer! adds one more link, Till it will crush me down into the grave. The Grave! Death has no terrors; and the Grave Is but a quiet pillow, soft as Down, Compared with this: why then not go to rest, And end this struggle, tentimes worse than Death? Death's but a painted scarecrow, a bugbear, Coined from old Nursestales, and childhood's fears, That babies most of us to our last day. A dartarmed Skeleton weak Fancy sees, Yet all this melts in Air, into thin Air, At the bold glance of calm Philosophy. Is there no more then than a Jugglery Of vain imagination? nothing more Beyond the Grave? that makes so many shrink With one foot in it, from the deed half done? Better to plunge at once and not think on it. Thought gets beyond his depth, and in his fear. Catches at any straw to keep himself Afloat, and get to shore again: I have strange Doubts: These Prisonwalls are little fitted to Add force to Sophistries. CLERGYMAN ENTERS. My Friend, I come To offer Consolation, and to mix My Tears with yoursâ this aweful trial has Opened, I trust, thy Heart? The seed that's sown In the deep Furrow of real Misery Is likeliest to growâ PRISONER. â it is too deep, 'Tis choked beneath the weight: your Pains are vain; And yet I thank thee, I have need of Solace, If such deep anguish can admit of it. CLERGYMAN. Sincere Repentance, though it be delayd Too long, must ever be acceptable To God, and where that is, is ever Hope. PRISONER. Think you so?â no, it cannot beâ too great, Too long, have been my Sins; I dare not hope, I dare not think â to think is Madness â Fiends Laugh in my Ear, and glare upon my Sight! And with his stony Eye fixed on me, with (The Clergyman looks in awestruck Silence) His icelike Glance, so stirless, look! 'tis He! Dost thou not see him? where are then thine Eyes? He comes towards meâ Save meâ save meâ (The prisoner sinks on his Strawbed, and covers his eyes). CLERGYMAN. âStrange ((apart) How the Mind can subdue the Sense, made thus Obedient to its will, and people space With the dread Image of the haunted Soul! My Friend! (aloud) that which thou seest exists alone In thy own Mind, which casts the Shadow of Its Thought on outward things: that must be cleansed, Ere this dread Spectre can be layd: then seek For Consolation, where alone 'tis found, In Penitence and Prayer. PRISONER. â 'tis gone: 'tis gone. And yet'twas no vain Dream: alas! too real. What matters whether it were seen with, or Without, the Body's Eye, if it be seen? 'Tis horrible â CLERGYMAN. â Come kneel we down, and pray To him, who can alone from such Dreams free The waking Soul. PRISONER. I cannot, dare not pray, Methinks some Devil laughs into my Ear And jabbers o'er the words with me, until They lose all meaningâ leave me for awhile, Perhaps I may be in a fitter Mood. CLERGYMAN. Beware of rash delay â the Time is short, And a few moments now are worth long years: Cast them then not away PRISONER. â thou speakÃ«st well. This hour cÃ²mments shrewdly many a Page, Which at the first Perusal seemed to bear Far other meaningâ our Booktheories Are not worth one halfhour of real Life; They do well for the Closet and the Lamp, Where the Philosopher pens down what Facts He pleases, and curtails the Life of Man In the Straightwaistcoat of a Syllogism; I will repent me; I will learn to pray But leave me, I must with my Thoughts awhile Wage war. CLERGYMAN. â Do so, but seek that better Light, Without which they must lead thee still astray. I leave thee to his mercy, who knows far, Far better even than ourselves, what 'tis We do and suffer â fare thee well awhile, And may he lead thy Thoughts to good Result. PRISONER alone, looking round till his Eye rests on a Spidersweb. How busyly yon spider on the wall Spins his frail web! I never thought till now That the Philosopher might learn from him! What a vile Masquerade is life! a Man Scarce knows himself, till Time lifts up the veil, And shows him in Truth's glass the very face And feature of his Beingâ what a game Of dull Crossquestions are we ever at! Fools of Halfinsight, and of Halfresolve! And when the Play is up, the most surprised Of all who took a part in it, is he, Who, in his spiderwisdom, thought to hold Each Thread and Line securely in his hand, Flattering himself that thro' the mighty web Of causes and effects, his eye could trace Unto its destination each least thread! That he could guide them all, and at his will, Immesh his Enemies, secure himself. But this Foxcunning's a depravÃ«d thing, And oft outwits itself; it grasps too much. The indirect effects, that multiply Beyond all calculation, these lie not Within man's feeble foresight â thus the web He spins so cunningly, is rounded and Embraced still by the workings of a Power, Which some call Chance and others Providence, That turns into a certain Instrument Of retribution some uncared for thread, Whose manywinding course the planner's eye Has followed not aright; transforming it Into the mainefficient cause to bring His schemes to nought! now will I pray awhile. (kneels) (The Jailor enters, and he starts up). JAILOR. I meant not to intrude. I knew not thatâ (breaks short) PRISONER apart. I like not these coarse Natures to behold The Struggles of my Soul â what would'st thou, Man? (aloud) JAILOR. The news I bring you is not of the best, I love not these same Errands, tho' they be All in the way of Trade: this Paper here Will spare my Telling. PRISONER takes the Paper, and reads. âthen the Day is fixed! (pauses and goes on) Tomorrow, the last Morrow of them all! It sounds just like the Rest, as if it were But an unmeaning Fellow to them; so, The Play is out!â but when that Morrow is A Yesterday! what then? Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, thus we live, And with one Foot already in the Grave, Talk of Tomorrow as a thing of Course, And Yesterday was a Tomorrow too, Tho' now as flat and stale as yon' hard Bread. And that same aweful Morrow, that is made But by a Yesterday! JAILOR â Wish you aught else? PRISONER I had a wish: but let it go: 'tis not The Time or Place for Wishingâ these four walls, And this same Paper cripple both Hope's wings. JAILOR Farewell, I pity thee! PRISONER âAnd this Pang too Must be endured: the Pity of such Men! The veriest wretch must point his finger at, And say, Â«he pities meÂ» LAST SCENE. PRISONER (alone.) âa prison is a wondrous School! A world apart! and in brief space of time Twill teach the wisest much that he ne'er knew, Or dreamt of in his Airphilosophizings, And sober down his Bubblefancies to The shape of stern reality: it makes A Jack-of-all-trades in a few short hours! A Man can turn his hand to anything, From picking locks to true Philosophy And problems in Selfknowledge! aye, e'en so! Into how few short moments Thought can crowd The actions of a life! oh cursed Thought, That in thy vicelike grasp canst crush the Heart; To thee all Time's the same: by thee the grave And cradle touch â the Past and Future are As one, and in thine Immortality, Man feels his deep damnation, and is his Own Hell already: aye! a prison can Force cold conviction down the throat of Guilt, Tho' it be hard as iron to digest, And ask an Ostrichstomach: here I am, Self left with Self, a deadly Pair of Foes, When not the best of Friends: no specious tongue To cozen conscience with its gilded baits, No merry Booncompanions still to chase Unpleasant thoughts, and snatch me from myself. My scornings and my mockeries of God Now turn like trodden Asps to sting me, but With tenfold hate; and every scoffing word Returns like a vile vomit to my Lips. Not one good deed to sweeten memory, To stay the avenging hand of God, or give The slightest hope that late repentance may Atone sins past! Hell gapes for me: oh God! Have mercy on my Soul â help, help, help (falls senseless) (Enter the Jailor and assistant.) JAILOR SPEAKS. Poor wretch! tho' I am little wont to weep O'er vulgar Sorrows, yet such misery As this might stir a Heart of Stone to tears, This trance, death's shadowy Type, that seals awhile The sense of woe, were better lost in Death: For Life is but poor boon to such as he! ASSISTANT SPEAKS. Aye, aye, poor Devil he were better dead, Than thus to die by Inches, and to be Hanged after all: such griefs as this, methinks, Might split the stoutest Heart, tho' 'twere of Oak. (The Jailor throws water from the prisoner's Jug on his face, and he comes to: the Jailor speaks.) Yet in the course and usage of my trade I have oft marked that grievous Ills have power To counteract our nature, and preserve The life which we would cast away: but hush! He moves. â (The prisoner, half lying and supported by the Jailor.) â'tis cold; my Heart is very cold, As if an icy hand had clutched it, and Outsqueezd the Lifesblood: where am I? oh where, Speak, say, in Hell? or does this hated Life Still cling unto me, like a curse: avaunt! Ye Hellfiends! I am not yet yours â not yet, No, no, not yet, not yet! Oh, oh: oh. (shuddering.) Who says I murdered him?â thou! thou! that stand'st Staring upon me with thy glazÃ«d Eyes, Thou art long since but Dust and Rottenness, And canst not rise up from thy bloody Grave To witness 'gainst me! down, down, down into Thy Coffin; ha: ha: ha: 'tis gone. JAILOR SPEAKS. Pray calm yourself, poor soul, there is none here To harm or torture you: the fiend himself Might pity your condition, were he here; But your poor, old, heartbroken Mother waits, And fain would see her son once more. PRISONER SPEAKS. â The fiend! Yes, yes, he's here, he burns within my breast Like Hellfire! JAILOR SPEAKS. â Nay, nay now your fancy roves Downright; I said your Mother waited here And fain would see you once more â ere â (breaks short.) PRISONER SPEAKS. â My Mother!â JAILOR SPEAKS. Yes, your own old Mother? PRISONER. My Mother? JAILOR. Why! have you no Mother? PRISONER, (shuddering.) Have I no Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! what means that word? Is it a spell, that like the Lightningsflash Through the dark Shroud of Night, it thus calls up The spirit of departed years, each trace, However faint, of Evildeeds, whose stain Has dyed my Heart until each rising thought Is hued, as though 'twere dipped in Blood, in spite Of all I do to shape it otherwise: As to the Infant's gaze each object takes The colour of its fears: my Mother â aye! I had a Mother tooâ she'd sing to me, And take me on her knee, a little Boy, A little happy Boy â her Hair is gray! What saydst thou, man, of her? my Mother, she Who gave me Life: oh cursÃ«d Life: thricecurs'd, And now once more bestows the hated Boon Of Life and Consciousness. Oh God! Oh God! Why wilt thou not reduce me unto dust? I cannot look on her: it is too much: And yet my Heart would fain break on the Heart That bade it beat, and ask her blessing once â (breaks short and shudders.) Her Blessing, whom I've cursed! oh Mockery! (Bursts into Tears and falls, supported by the Jailor: his Mother enters, flying towards him, and violently agitated; the Clergyman follows.) PRISONER. â Oh Christ! 'tis her! MOTHER SPEAKS. My Son, my Son; have mercy on him, God! Oh give him Breath that he may hear my Blessing, And then receive us both into thy peace. (falls on his Neck.) SON SPEAKS. And can you bless me, Mother, whose gray Hairs I have brought down in sorrow to the Grave? And in whose Deathbedpillow I thus plant The Thorns that wound thy anguishstricken Head? MOTHER SPEAKS. I can forgive thee all â thou art my Child, I feel but this, and may God pardon thee, As now I do! SON SPEAKS. Oh sweet drop in this Cup of Bitterness! (Prisonbell rings: his Mother faints at it.) SON SPEAKS. Mother, what ails you? help, my God! she dies. And I have murdered her too. help, some water. (They throw some of the Prisoner's drinkingwater in her face, but in vain.) CLERGYMAN SPEAKS, (while he supports the Mother.) My Son, be patient, God is merciful; He gives and takes away in his good time, And Death is a benificent angel, The sole Peacebringer to such grief as this: He seals the Eye and Ear, when every sense Is but a varied Inlet to new shapes Of Agony; and she, be thou assured, Is even now among the blessed, where This mortal Coil oppresses her no more! She hath drank off the cup of bitterness E'en to the Dregs, and by this suffering Is purified unto salvation: Oh! My Son, think that thou seest her kneeling by The Mercyseat and praying unto God To pardon thee, and take thee to his Peace. Come join thy Prayer with hers, that Mercy's ear The readier may incline; a broken and A contrite Heart the Lord will not despise! He himself bids thee hope, then be assured: But yet a little while 't will all be o'er. (The Prisoner who has been looking intently in his Mother's Face and lost to everything else, now clasps her in his arms and breaks out.) Oh God! my Mother, speak to me, one word! You shall not die; you shall not leave me thus. Give me a Glass â (a Glass is brought, which he holds up to her Mouth). Oh God! dead, dead, stonedead! (flings himself on the Ground). Would that I were but such a Clod as this, Feeling and knowing nought for evermore, A little worthless Dust, no more nor less, Which the winds scatter, and the rain doth wet. CLERGYMAN. Oh Heavenly Father, look thou down on these Poor Sinners; by thy secret Agency Accomplish thou what we frail Beings here Cannot effect, and unto my weak words Impart that balm which is not in themselves. Speak by my Lipâ my Son, look up to Heaven, Whence comfort only comes, not down on this Sad token of the Pastâ forward alone Is Peace, behind thee all is Doubt and Fear! PRISONER, (hanging over his Mother's Body). Oh God! and is it come to thisâ have these Dear Lips not one, one word for meâ where then Is Comfort, if that Heart which beat for me, Be cold, cold as a stoneâMother! Mother! (shaking the Body) Wake from this Sleep; 'tis cruel thus to sleep. What sayst thou? that I made thee sleep? God, God, 'Tis true: but thou sleep'st wellâ no frightful Dreams Vex thy calm Rest, nor Hope nor Terror stretch Thee on their Rack, like me. CLERGYMAN. â come, come, enough: Tis idle thus to add fresh Bitterness Unto the Cup of Sorrowâ PRISONER. â Man, begone! Thou know'st not what it is to suffer; look, Look on these poor gray Hairsâ they are a Mother's, And I haveâ murdered herâ dost understand?â No, no, ye cannot.â I, I only can. CLERGYMAN. Poor Soul, I feel for you indeed, but calm Yourself a little; the worst Pain is o'er, Methinks, and that to come will scarce be felt. PRISONER. Yes, yes, I feel that this Deathagony, ((staring at his mother's Body which is being carried out). Could not endure much longer, though I were Not doomed to die that horridest of Deaths, To dangle in the Air before the gazeâ (breaks short) Let me not think on that, it makes my flesh Creep, and my Hair to rise; Death is dreadful, When sweetened with kind looks and loving words, When all good wishes do attend us on Our journey to that bourne whence none return; Aweful in its obscurity and gloom E'en to the best, who trust there to receive The due reward for what they suffer here, For fortune's buffets, the oppressor's scorn, For unrequited good, repaid with Ill, For sufferings where no guilt hath drawn them down On th' unoffending Head, while Crime hardby Thriving and bold, treads with his insolent foot Poor patient Merit down into the dirt. What is it then to me, if I receive According to my deeds? and where, oh where, Is this dread Journey, on whose aweful brink I stand, to end? the leap is into Hell! CLERGYMAN SPEAKS. My Son, thou'rt overcurious; to doubt, Is now perdition: If there be no trust, How shall the Lord accept thine offering? That Bourne, which thou so fearÃ«st, cannot be Beyond his Mercy, be it where it may; Yea, in the bottomest pit of Hell He's there: The Dread lies in the apprehension more Than in the fact, and busy fancy fills The void with her own fears; come conquer her, See with the Eye of Faith, and all that's dark, With her celestial light she will make clear, And thou shalt stumble not; 'twill soon be o'er.â PRISONER SPEAKS. Yes, yes, 'twill soon be o'er! 'tis brief indeed â (mastering his emotion.) But terrible!â a moment's suffering, Where every second is split up into A separate Agony, boundless, infinite; For it is not by time we measure pain. The Twitching of some Muscle, the hard Gasp Of the stopp'd Breath! and thenâ Oh God! Oh God! I shall be where!â in â (shudders, and recovers himself, then resumes, as the Deathofficers come to lead him off, and the Deathbell rings again) Headache or Heartache, 'twill be soon all one! Lead on, I am myself again, the worst Is over; God have mercy on my Soul! CLERGYMAN. Amenâ(all) Amen â (Scene drops) REVERIES OF NATURE. 1 How sweet! to stand upon the Oceansshore, And hear the gentle billows kiss the strand, Like murmurs on Love'slip; while, rude no more, The Winds sport o'er his bosom, coollyfanned By their moist wings; aye with rapt wonder scanned And mingling awe by mortal Eye, tho' Calm Sit halcyonlike upon his breast, and land Brightsmiling laughs away all thought of harm; Still on his azure brow th' Eternal's writ, Omnipotence is in his rest, still hallowing it! 2 We gaze, and gaze, on his wide world of waves As we would read our hidden Destiny And shape our fortunes from the Tide that laves The feet of him who passes momently E'en as the grains of sand that 'neath him lie; Time's wasteful wing hath swept old Ocean's brow, A Mockery; he hath not tinged with grey A single lock, nor laid one sole charm low; Not timeborn thou, nor subject e'er shalt be, Eternity alone can hold itself and thee! 3 Dread Minister of th' everliving God! Whose aweful spirit o'er thy wavy brow, Allchanging, yet ne'er chang'd itself hath trod In olden time! thou, whose almighty flow Of myriad seas did lay the proud world low In its dark depths, as if 't had never been; When forth the Almighty's Vengeance bade thee go, To execute his lateroused wrath, to clean Sin's Leprosy from the deeprotting Earth, Baptized by thy eternal waters to new birth! 4 And then, thy mighty task with ease o'ercome, As't had been nothing, didst sink back once more Into thy Giantself, thy boundless home! Lambmeek, yet lionstrong; thy aweful roar Died out in praise upon the obedient shore, Sought by thy myriad waves, who victors sang The Lord of Hosts, th' appointed triomph o'er, While thousandvoicÃ«d Hallelujahs rang; Ages unsummed thou roll'st in calm and strife, Yet is thy might unworn, thy Form still fresh with life. 5 Thou changeless Mirror, where the Seasons glass Their manyweathered faces: yet are they Potent on Earth alone, o'er thee they pass Like empty shadows o'er the sun's bright ray; They strew no leaves nor low thy beauties lay! Thou baskest in, yet quenchest his proud Beams, Or mov'st in mystic dance with thy Queenfay, The Vestal Moon, whose love alone beseems; Thou laughest at the winds in playful scorn, Thy Giantmirth, fresh, fearless, boundless, and unworn 6 Thou flowÃ«st with thine azure Zone around The Universe, and bindest with thy stream The severed fragments of a world; thy sound Is as the voice of Heaven, and might seem An Echo of Eternity, a dream, Of future things; th' immortal lights shine o'er Thy face, and with their imaged radiance beam, Fit Jewels for such brow; thy depths have store Unbounded, all that's vast and bright and strange, Where manunawed, thy myriad tribes in freedom range! 7 Yet still his daring steps are on thy fields Tho' He has never tamed thee to his power, Thy keelploughed plain as rich a harvest yields As delvÃ«d Earth assigns her sons in dower; What tho' in wholesome wrath thy brow doth lower, And thy roused Might should scatter the frail Pride And Strength of Man, whom thou, for some brief Hour Tossing in Sport, engulfest in thy Tide, As in Eternity, yet still thou flow'st A Beautybond of Life and Hope from Coast to Coast! 8 Highway of Civilization! thou Hast wafted Time's rich freights on thy free tide. While Truth and Wisdom's lights, (whose radiant bow, Conjointly rising on the basis wide Of Past and Present, spans from side to side Time's still clouddimmed Horizon,) caught by thee, Have shone reflected from thy wavy pride Upon the Nations, who grew blest free! Genius has trod thy paths, new worlds displayd; The Gospel has shone o'er thy brows and holy made! 9 Thou o'er whose Virginbreast, the great, the good. Th' inspired Columbus passed; He, whom God chose To bear the Truthtorch o'er thy mystic flood, And kindle that bright sun, which widely rose A Dayspring over half mankind; which throws Its beams reflected from a thousand seas, And lights a thousand nations; the brief woes Of this our mortal life, all that it has Of greatest and most wonderworthy sink To nought, when on thine ageless, godlike power we think! 10 Th' Almighty's Emblem! thou do'st dwell alone And commun'st with thyself, thy sympathy Is not accorded to frail things that own The stamp of mortal birth; but from on high Thy Inspiration fresh is drawn, nor die Thy manyvoicÃ«d waves in murmurs vain; In Conclave dark they meet, when mortal eye And step in fear have fled the ominous Main, To talk of Time and Fate; and then o'er Earth, From thousand shores speak warning to man's sinfull mirth 11 Thou goÃ«st forth in Beauty and in Might, Still in eternal youth thy race to run, Taintless amidst corruption, as the light, Which, when God looked on thee, thy brows upon Broke at Creationsdawn; when rose the sun To glass his form in thy bright wonderment; Earth's countless streams, the rainbowed clouds, all own Thee as their mighty Parent; thou hast lent The Earth her freshness; who shall sing thy praise, Eternity's dread type, ages to thee are days! 12 Thou visible Eternity! at whose behest Those fathomless and boundless thoughts, that swell To agony the o'erinformÃ«d breast, With their deep prisoned Tide, those thoughts that tell The weakness and the strength of mind so well, As at some dread enchanter's call, must leave Their clayey prisonhouse, and 'neath his spell Shape their dim meanings visibly and heave With wild pulsations of unearthly life, As tho' th' Immortal were with this frail clay at strife! 13 For, ever as we gaze on thee, we feel Thy Vastness fill us with a kindred ray Of Immortality, the big heart reel, Struggling to dive the mighty thoughts that lay The Spirit prostrate in their wavy play Of bottomless profundity; the wind, Midoceanborn, that o'er thy laughing spray Sporteth untaint, doth on thy bosom find Meanings and Inspirations deep, and seems To breathe the breath of a real life o'er man's wild dreams. 14 Could I embody those deep yearnings that Flash o'er my troubled spirit like the bright Eyedazzling lightning; could I fitly mate Immortal thoughts with words of heavenly might To stir the soul, Oh! they would dash the sight Of dimeyed mortals like the lines of fire, Which, lightningtraced upon the shroud of night. Spake, in their silent brightness, words of ire Allusion to Nebuchadnezzar's feast and the frewriting on the wall. To the feastboasting Monarch, but the weak, And flagging wing must needs beneath such burthen break. 15 And I have clasped in love thy briny waves, Whose seasonable salt, like truth, doth bear The properties of health: and 'mid thy caves, Where, like a mighty Lion in his lair, Thou flow'dst recumbent, oft alone would dare To join thy whelplike billows in their play; Till I have felt my spirit freed from care, E'en as my body from all leprosy, All taint of Earth, as I had plunged my soul Into Eternity, and felt myself made whole! 16 For ever on thee is the Shadow cast Of the Eternal's Glory; oft unseen, But felt, his spirit o'er the face hath past Of the wide waters; not alone, I ween, When the mad tempestwinds upplough 'thy green And glittering depths, not in their wild career Alone, of passing fury, 'mid the sheen Of the cloudcleaving lightning, is he near, Robed in His terrors and extorting Faith from Fear, 17 But fitlier imaged to the thoughtful mind Than in brute forms of strife, which, passing by Fell Havoc leave to witness for their blind, Their brief and selfexhausting energy; Far fitlier imaged in the majesty Of the calm ocean, when his mighty form Stretches in boundless solitude away In soullike vastness: when no wrinkling storm, His serene brow with Passion's traces doth deform! 18 Oh! then if the Invisible God may be Typed fittingly in aught that's visible, Then Ocean, doth he glass his form in thee; His spirit walks upon thee, and the spell Of his Almighty Presence, sensible, Embraces us in its immensity, Filling all Being, even as thy swell So gently, yet so irresistibly, Fills each least bay, and creek, and shore that round thee lie! 19 And gazing on thee we grow hushed and still, As we had stept into Eternity; And as thy mighty voice doth gently fill Our ears with awed delight, and as the eye Grows to a more creative faculty Grasping thy vastness, we into the sphere Of thy blest calm are drawn: all passions die, And in their pause the inner voice we hear Making sweet music with thine own in Nature's Ear! 20 And now, most aweful of created things! Ocean! thou Name of terror and delight! Thou on whose waters the Destroyer flings In vain the shadow of his wingÃ«d might, Time the Unresting! who before thy sight Hath strewed with Desolation each proud shore Whence o'er thy face the Darkness and the Light Of Good and Evil in the days of yore Was shed from Empires vast, now dust, to rise no more! 21 Farewell, farewell; yet 'tis an idle word, For part of me art thou, wheree'er I go And of my Being; still thy voice is heard, As tho' I stood upon the shore, a low, A still, sad music, piercing tho' I know Not why or wherefore to my inmost core; And tho' far, far away from thee, somehow Or other, I behold the forms of yore And stand, as of another Life upon the shore! 22 Tho' other shapes of Beauty ask my song, Yet in the shadow of thy Presence I Still walk, as in a dream; and fancies throng, Like Landscapes, on the eye of memory; And sounds are in my ears which cannot die, The hollowvoicÃ«d main that rolleth on, The deep bass to all Nature's harmony: Unchanging while all changes 'neath the sun; Earth's bubbles, like the water's, burst, and all is gone! 23 Thy memory haunts me with its Presence, and Mingles with all I think or feel; it flows A deep strong Undercurrent, overspann'd By many a sunbow which wild Fancy throws In sport athwart it, and around it grows A host of Memory's wildflowers by it fed, Unwithering; while the fount from whence it rose, The pure Castalian fount, the deep springhead Within the heart, still flows as erst from Heaven it did! 24 But I must turn from thee, thou ancient Deep, Awakener of yearnings which defy All compass, save of thought: as dreams in sleep Exist but to Imagination's Eye, From Time and Space, and all the Jugglery Of sense set free; so too the thoughts that wake Before thee, ask an ampler faculty Of Soul; for they a wider range still take Skyward than the senseshackled spirit's wing dare make 25 I turn from thee, to forms which lovely are In their ownselves, but lovelier far I ween When linked with thoughts of thee: for then they share The spell thou shed'st on all that e'er has been Hallowed by memory of what we've seen Amid thy wonders; and we love them more Than words can tell, if they recall the Green Of the windcurling billow, or the shore Where in thy mighty Song of Joy our Part we bore! 26 Ye Clouds! which are the Scenery of Heaven, Ye everchangeful pageants of the sky, How glorious are ye when the goldbreath'd Ev'n, Piling ye up in might and majesty, Pours its rich inspiration far and nigh Throughout your phantomranks; Oh then how sweet, By brookside seated, with dilating eye And swelling heart, to mould ye as ye fleet, To the soul's wish, as Memory or Hope think meet! 27 With Fancy's wand to touch ye into shapes Of Glory and of Promise, such as ne'er On man's frail sight have shone, till He escapes From sense's thralldom, and can look with clear And steady glance beyond this dim scene here Of dust and darkness; till the soul hath so Subdued this mortal coil of Hope and Fear To its own Essence, that no outward Show But like ye clouds, suntouched, to some high type doth grow! 28 Ye sunsetclouds, how beautiful ye are, With flamespire towering from some mountainpeak Thro' Heaven's vast azure dome, which seen afar Seems pillared up by ye; or when the wreck Of golden vapors on green ills doth break, Streaming along the raindropglittering trees, And leaving happy valleys in their wake, Shrouded with hazy beauty, till the breeze The dim, mistmantle shakes, and every cloudflake flees. 29 And ye, that wait upon the Silvermoon, Ye Cloudisles floating in the airsea blue, Tempering her ray, and who from her the boon Of Beauty take, how lovely are ye too, When passing by, the brightbeamed stars peer thro Your veil, like spirits; or when o'er some lake, As in a magicglass, ye noiseless strew Your manyshapÃ«d forms, or earthwards shake, In silvermists, your dewwealth over dell and brake, 30 And not less fair, tho' garisher'tmay be The morningsuncloud's fairyshapes of light With firebase on the azurebosomed sea, When the first daybreeze stirs his slumberous might, Scattering the rearclouds of the darkbrowed night With golden flamestreaks; and in foammaned play The wave uprears its bubbles flashing bright, And as the cloudwreaths windstirred roll away, Creation seems anew to burst forth on the day! 31 And Oh! how beautiful, like fairylands, Mansfootuntrodden, stretching far away, With happy valleys and goldmargined sands, Where shapes of wondrous beauty seem to stray, Spirits in blessed converse: while the play Of fairyfancied winds sweeps from our eyes The mighty Panorama on its way, Still changing momently; new forms arise, We turn aside and sigh, for all are of the skies! 32 Earth knows them not! a homelier beauty hers, More fitted to man's Destiny and End! The bright Cloudvision passing, idly stirs The Fancy, leaving nought behind to blend With afterbeing: not one trace, to lend The Glories of the Past to coming days; Tis the heart's birthright, Faith and Love extend To life's most fleeting forms a divine Grace, And from Time's grave past Shapes of Glory still can raise! 33 On some far harvest Fancy's golden light Shines radiant: she will not bow her pride To glean near pleasures, surer, if less bright; Better in idlest mood by some streamside To stretch thy limbs, and mould the clouds that hide Its surface to thy wishes, than to base Hope's frail aircastles on the Future; Tide And Time roll on: we claim but that small space Whereon we stand, then build there thy heart's dwelling place. 34 But fearful are ye clouds that float along Wrathmessaged, stormblack, over land and sea; When o'er glad harvestfields, a legioned throng Of scathefraught elements, frail mortals see Ye gather in your tempestmajesty, Strewing the year's ripe glories in the dust, And making Hope and Toil a mockery; Yet not allill, for still ye teach us trust In Providence, whose mercy compensates the worst! 35 And thou, most glorious Orb! whose gorgeous light Blazons the clouds until their pageantry Seem scatterings from God's own hand; in might Thou comest forth, and during majesty, Amid the storm, and mist and darkness fly, Leaving the chrystal Dome of Heaven clear As at Creation's dawn; no mortal eye May gaze at thee, bright Ruler of the year, Thy Maker's Image, for, like him, thou changest ne'er! 36 Most beautiful and beautygiving Orb! How glorious thy coming! in the sky The starry lamps are dim, thou dost absorb All meaner Lights in thy Immensity, On Night's chill brow the last pale Gem doth die! And from the eyelids of the blushing Morn, Sleep's sweet Lethean Dew, dropped silently By angelswings on mortals sorrowworn, Thou kissest off, and in her smile the day is born! 37 Behold! the greymists, round the mountainshead, That from the streamfed dale in still wreaths rise, And from the blind depths where the river's bed Tho' viewless, from its rush, the ear descries, Are touched with sudden glory; the wind plies His unseen Office, giving motion to The lazyflakÃ«d clouds: athawrt the skies A golden Light is flung; and glistening thro' Their radiant veil, the hillsidewoods break on'our View. 38 How beautiful! to Fancy it might seem As Light and Darkness were at strife; for tho' In gorgeous masses, on one side, the stream Of sunlight pour, o'er hill and wood and brow Of forlorn crag, like Glory wreathing Woe And haggard Care, and on the flaky foam Of Waterfall, mistshrouded, where below From some tall rock it leaps, as tho' its home And source were 'mid the clouds, yet still thick woof of Gloom 39 Hangs on the other side, thro'which is heard The far off torrent's dash, the sheepbell clear, With herdsman's shout and song of morningbird, Or deeper lowing of the ploughyoked steer, To which the mountainsummits, chiming, bear Blithe company, from every crag and peak, With a far Round of Echoes; now 'tis here, Now there, now in a pack the voices break, Like hounds when givingtongue, now responsesingly make, 40 As the old hills, in very wantonness Of Joy, had flung the Echo now this way, Now that, with modulations numberless, And laughter hoarse; but where the golden ray Embathes the other side, the hills display Visions of Beauty, and we seem to see The Â«Fortunate FieldsÂ» sung in the Poetslay, Hesperian groves and golden fruits, where free From mortal grief the soul might dwell eternally; 41 Celestial vision! to the common Earth Giving the blessedness of Paradise, 'Till it grow lovely as our place of birth; Oh happy Mortal, to whose wondering Eyes Such sight is given; what a blest surprize Is thine when toilforespent, on some bold height That makes thee seem a dweller of the Skies, Turning, thou seest the realms of lingering night, Farstretching 'neath thy feet, hills bathed in golden Light, 42 And mountainpeaks, cloudsevered from their base Like airborne Isles, that float amid the sky: Some woodcrowned, others crag, with many a trace Of lightning firefurrowed; momently They change their shapes and hues, as mists float by: While in the Lake, halfvisible below, (Placed like a fairyglass to cheat the eye, Whether in Earth or Air we scarcely know), Allforms of cloud, wood, cliff are blent in wondrous Show! 43 Oh happy Mortal! whom this blessed hour Hath chosen as its witness, who can see And feel within his inmost soul the power Of its deep, calm, heartreaching harmony; And who by perfect blessedness, setfree From life's dull load, enjoys in spite of thought That moment, as it were Eternity, To him the vision with real life is fraught, And its high meaning from beyond all time is brought! 44 'Tis gone! too beautiful to last, but long Enough for blessedness, for him who knows To unload the golden moment's wing: the throng Of mists are all uprolled, the Landscape grows Clear and distinct; beneath the bright sunbow's O'erarching span yon' waterfall foams down The woodgirt cliff, and high its spray it throws Into the sunny air, then allunknown, Save by a fresher growth, its modest path is shown, 45 Like that of charity; the world awakes! The flowerhaunting bee is on the wing, The voice of man is heard, and all the brakes Are musical with song; the mountains ring, As peak with peak in Joy were communing; The blithewinged Lark, sunbeam of minstrelsy, High up at heaven's gate, unseen, doth fling His sparklike notes abroad, and ear and eye Reciprocate their Joy: one sense is aided by 46 Another and perfected; thus the hue And sweet breath of the flower is made more Sweet by the air's soft music, and the dew So beautiful to sight, is trodden o'er Like a crushed perfume; on all sides the power Of Him, who made the Earth in Love, is known And felt, and from all living things the hour Unfailing proofs calls forth; one mighty tone Of Joy: a thousandvoicÃ«d hymn from Gladness won! 47 Life's thousandpulsing heart, unwearied, Beats with one throb of blessedness; ask ye, Who wove the Beautygarment which is spread Over Earth's nakedness? 'twas even He Who at Creation's dawn bade all things be; Who spake, and from the waste of Chaos rose Colour and Form, in perfect Harmony, To clothe all things; who most his power shows, Not in the Earthquake, but in Nature's calm repose! 48 The Sun is up! most glorious orb! the Earth Changes her garments with the changing year, The seasons weave them; thou, as at thy birth, The selfsame aspect allunchanged dost bear; Ocean himself of this our nether sphere Partakes the instability, his brow With wrath is stirred, and man in awe and fear Approaches him; but, like thy Maker, thou, In undisturbÃ«d Calm seest all things change below; 49 Therefore of Him a worthier type, for He Is subject not to Passion, nor doth know Change or Disturbance; from all error free, Therefore from all Mutation; and as thou With overlight dost darken when we throw Our rash glance on thee, so upon the mind When thinking of thy Maker there doth flow A flood of Glory, groping like the blind, In that vast, boundless Void some beaten track to find! 50 On Empire's cradles thou hast shed thy Light And on their Graves: they from thy changeless beam, Like motes, have passed away; at Power's height Thou shon'st awhile on them, then as a dream, Or Shadow thrown upon Time's fleeting Stream, They vanished into Nothingness; all save High Truths and Virtues, which alone redeem A Nation's memory from Oblivion's wave; These, in eternal Forms, still triomph o'er the Grave! 51 The Poetspen, the Page of History, Have raised for them a shrine, built up by Thought, Whose ayeenduring Elements defy All Chance and Change; for what thereof is wrought, With Marble from the living quarry brought, Is based fullsurely; even with that same Wherewith the blind MÅonides erst sought To rear the mighty Temple of his Fame, Which Earthquakes shake not, nor consumes the wasteful Flame! 52 Stronger and fairer than of Parian stone; Upon whose walls we read the History Of an whole People, which were else long gone From Earth with scarce a record, of whose high And towering Dome the keystone was placed by The mighty hand of Truth, and whose broad base On Human Nature rests eternally; There hangs the wondrous mirror where we trace The image of a Nation's manyfeatured face. 53 Where placed beyond the reach of Time, we see The Past made Present, and as we look on That Glass, like Dupes of some strange Jugglery, We step into another world; anon, We see Troy's towers glittering in the Sun, And snowcrowned Ida: with the inner ear, We catch th'Egean 's manymurmuring tone, That breaks in Homer's verse, so full and clear, On the sandmargined beach, and Hector's warshout hear, 54 As from the citygates, flung openwide, The battlestream pours forth upon the plain, With plumes that toss like foam, and all the pride Of neighing steeds that whirl the car amain, 'Mid dustclouds halfdiscerned: and there a Fane Rears its sungleaming Dome, thro' whose high Gate The whiterobed Priests, an incensebearing train, Are disappearing, met to supplicate: And hark! a solemn hymn uprises for the State! 55 But thou, Oh Sun, allbright tho' thou mayst be, Shin'st not on these things, they are scenes from days Which bask'd once in thy Light, but which we see By it no more; another Glory plays Upon that Landscape, and with brighter rays Than Thou canst give, those scenes are clothed for aye! Morn sheds not such a Light e'en on the ways Of Youth and Hope, when hand in hand they stray, Nor e'en to Love's own Eyes can Earth such hues display! 56 Those Scenes are steeped in a celestial Light, Transferred into an ampler atmosphere From dull Reality; the radiance bright Which falls on Hector's casque, as by his dear Andromache he stands, undimm'd and clear, From Truth's own Sun descends; Time hath no Power To change that Landscape, or to render sere; From sensual Sight, e'en as a passing flower, He mowed its Glory down, and after its brief hour 57 Of palpable Existence, he destroy'd, As was his Priviledge, that which He gave; But now it lives, for aye to be enjoyed, A glorious vision risen from the Grave, Of dull mortality no more the slave, To charm the inner eye; then triomph thou, My Soul, for this high Priviledge to save From Time's sere touch all that thou lov'st below, And learn from hence thine Immortality to know! 58 Shout, shout, and let the Universal Heart Of Nature echo back thy joy: let Sea, Let Mountains, Air, and Earth, from every part Make answer, as with human sympathy, Exulting in a common Victory; The Mirror in our Souls preserves still bright, Unfading, all that round us here doth lie; Still bygone scenes rise up to cheer our sight, And faces whence hath passed the touch of Sorrow's blight! 59 Then bloom, ye Groves, bloom on forever green, And fling your scents upon the Summerair As in past times: ye cannot lose your sheen, No Winter's chill breath ever shall lay bare Your leafy branches, but as tho' ye were The trees of Eden, shall ye live for aye; From you I'll pluck a garland fresh and fair For my grey locks, for sacred from decay, I see proud Ilium's walls defying still Time's sway! 60 Sweet Moon! companioned by thy chosen star, Cresting some silveredgÃ«d cloud that lies Athwart thine azure path, yet not to bar Thy Course, or rob thee from the Lover's eyes, Gazing now on eachother, now the skies, But only to thy charms to yield the more Of Homage, when, as o'er thee soft it flies, Thy halfveiled face a holier light doth pour, Like to a peaceful Nun's whose breathless lips adore! 61 Sweet Moon, be thou not unforgot, but shine In this poor verse, as erst in bygone days Upon my youthful sight, when I would twine 'Neath thy soft beams for my own brow the bays, The Museswreath; which Fancy, who still plays Her pranks upon us ere we know her well, Deceiving Elf, and how her presents craze, Binds on our temples, like a potent spell! Alas! how many thorns Time in that Wreath shall tell! 62 Shine forth, sweet Moon! on that bright waterfall, 'Mid whose unresting din I dreamt away Youth's happy moments, till they past recall Were fled and I then woke to Life's broadday, Jostling like others on its dusty way, And taught to set a value upon things, Which, tho' I cast as dross aside, men gray In cunning and worldwisdom, and whose wings Were clipped by Time, regarded as Life's only springs; 63 Oh! well do I remember what I felt, The sickness of the soul, the sinking heart, When 'neath the Eveningsky in prayer I knelt With boyish rapture, ere cold Form and Art With aught I did or thought claimed yet a part, And caught the sneer, the laugh of mockery, Of some cold worldlings near me; 'twas a smart That brought the indignant tear into my eye, And made me for a moment sad, I knew not why. 64 But now, alas, too well, too well I know; Time on Life's most perplexÃ«d page can make Sage comment, and a surer light will throw Than the dim midnightlamp, by which, for sake Of misnamed Wisdom, Pedants doze awake, When they had better sleep outright, like those Plain unsuspecting fools, who all things take For what they seem; He holds Truth's torch and shows What many a wise Philosopher would sadly pose! 65 And many a lesson has he taught me too Since then, and cleared up many a doubt, and made My heart a comment on itself; and thro' Selfknowledge Wisdom comes: else 'tis a trade Of words and phrases, sounding fine, but dead, Dead as the wormeat books where one good grain Amid a bushel of vile chaff is laid Up, and so choked with rubbish that in vain 'Twould germinate, 'till sown in real Life's soil again! 66 He taught me 'mong the rest this Truth, which we In youth are slow to learn, that men will sneer At what they understand not, tho' it be The noblest in its kind; that we must ne'er Bare to the vulgar gaze our hearts, or wear Our thoughts upon our lips; that Life's indeed A masquerade, where we a mask must bear Like to the rest, for if we would succeed, We must fall down and worship by the vulgar creed! 67 Yea! e'en a Milton's ample brow must be Cramped in the mask of Form: what sensual Eye Could bear unscathed, the naked majesty Of its sublime contempt, its calm and high, And serene Indignation: hallowed by The Truth, as whose Highpriest He watchÃ«d o'er Her Altarfire, lest its Light should die Out in this Land; that heart from heart and Shore From Shore, th' inspiring heat, might catch forevermore! 68 But Fancy, wave thy wand, for busy Thought Will ever be intruding; even here Within the magiccircle thou hast wrought Round trancÃ«d Youth, whom, when upon his bier We weep as lost, thou, stealing softly near, Touchest and breathest on, and then He wakes As fresh, as tho' year treading fast on year Had not rolled o'er him; thus thy sweet Spell makes His dream eterne; from thee a new Lifelease he takes! 69 Call up the wellknown scene: the playground, where Thou sportedst thro' the long, glad summerdays, As tho' Reality and thyself were Borntwins, not parting straight on different ways; Let the Moonshine lie soft: and Lo! it plays On each remembered spot, each rock and wood Rise steeped with beauty in the calm clear rays; See, with what glassy lustre on the flood The wavering flakelight falls, just where a boy I stood, 70 Gazing on it with neverwearied eyes, As still in silvereddys it shot by, And marked the waterbubbles gleaming rise, Or manyscalÃ«d fish; nought of the why Or wherefore of my pleasure then knew I; I saw the bright wave at my feet, not where Sombre and dark, towards Futurity, The altered stream swept on; I had from Care Not learnt that troubled Wisdom's curse which now I bear. 71 Appear once more thou manyshaded nook In the old wood, so leafy, cool and still, With thy sweet flowerbank, which downward took Its sloping course from that embowered hill, Kept ever fresh by one clear gurgling rill That in the river poured its little stream, A traveller from the mountains; still, oh still, I view the scene, on which, as in a dream, I gaz'd sweet hours, which sweeter in remembrance seem! 72 And there, softsleeping in the moonbeam's Light, I see the gray stoneshafted window rise, Of the old Abbey, dimly on my sight, With Ivy overgrown; half of it lies In strong clear outline backed by the blue skies, And the soft moon just rising into view Above the stonework, flying Buttresses, And spiral flights of the high roof, and thro' Each gap and chink: and on the long grass moist with dew 73 And motionless, the shadows fall, so clear, Distinct and sharp; and hark! borne on the air, Whose stillness makes the sound seem yet more near, The waterfall's long steady dash, from where It tumbles, like Ambition fallÃ«n ne'er To rise again, floats by me: and once more 'Mid the old Rocks and Caves the echoes are Ringing as they were wont to do of yore, Shouts of wild glee, as Earth rejoiced unto her core! DESPONDENCY REMOVED BY A DREAM, AND THOUGHTS THEREUPON. The mighty Fabric of the Universe, These vast Enchantmenthalls, as fair as when They like an Exhalation noiseless rose From Chaos, at the One Eternal's Word, While the Spheremusic tuned into its Place Each Part harmonious, domed by the bright Blue Heavensvault, with rich Cloudpictures strewn, Emblazonings of divine Hand, wrought by The primal Painter, primal Poet, stretched In sightoutreaching Loveliness away, To where the Billows kissed the purple Hem Of the Sun's Garment, sinking into Rest. A waking Vision, lovelier than Dreams, And real to him, who to the grand Idea Of this bright Universe has found the Clue In Faith, and Love, and calm Contentedness! The Scene was lovely as a Scene could be; The Rainbowhues and Forms that clothe this Earth, Were fresh and glorious as a Poetsdream Of Youth and springtide Love: so passingfair That he who gazed with but a casual Eye, Grew to Perception of a Loveliness Akin to highest Truthsâ to Faith, and Peace And Love revealed as one: a Loveliness Twinborn with Truth, and fading not away; Which in bright Radiance streams o'er the Earth, Leaving some Portion of its Light on all, However lowly, that fulfills its End In Lowliness and Love, on each Hedgeflower, Each Meadowdayseye, and each smallest Leaf; But most on Man's own Heart, when He at one With himself lives, and all around him here; Making it as a Beautyfount to him Who in himself is that which he should be, Who consciously possesses what he has, And consciously enjoys, by Selfcontent Creating for his Soul a Sabbathpeace, And in the Blessedness of this fair World, As in the Shadow of the most High God, Living, and with its Beauty clothed, as with A Garment 'bove the Reach of sere Decay! It was a glorious sunset! the far Sky Was barred with Cloudstreaks, and the Eveningwind, That Airmagician, with his Spellwandtouch, Had piled Cloudpalaces of gorgeous Show And vast Extent; Shapes infinite, of Hue Still changing momently, like Life's vain Dreams; Wherein the Soul itself might roam at large, And with the rich materials create The gorgeous Fabrics of the Days of Eld, Cathedralpiles, and Domes of fancyspan: When Faith drew from a richer Source than these Tho' thus allboundless; from high Piety And Love, that measured not the Moneycosts Of Wood and Stone, as in these dimeyed Days We dull Earthdrudges do: we dullsouled Race, Whose Hopes and Thoughts are ever on the Earth, Whose Hearts still grovel in its Dust, and pile Molelike, their passing Heaps of crumbling Clay! But worked allspiritualized to highest Ends, Creating for the Soul and from the Soul, A something that might seem eternal, like The Hope that gave it Birth; might body forth Not allunworthily, and bear some Touch Of those high Thoughts, whose during Majesty Can mould Earth's brute Materials to Types Of Feelings bove the Reach of chance and change! It was a lovely Eve; but over me Its Beauty pass'd like some vague, idle Dream; I could not make it a Reality, Nor reap th' invisible Harvest of its Joy. The Vision and the Faculty divine Had passed away from me; mine Eyes were dim To all the Shapes of Loveliness around, Mine Ears were dead to all Earth's Minstrelsy; For my own Heart, the keynote of all Joy, Was out of Tune, its selfcontent was gone, And I was for awhile, but what I seemed, Barely possessing what this Earth accords Of Time and Space, and in its Darkness wrapt As in a Pall; the pure, high Consciousness Of that which is beyond these outward Things, At Discontent's cold Touch, had passed away, Like Flowerodors, leaving me alone To struggle with myself, my only Foe. I sat me by the streamside, whence the Mist In Silversmoke, rose curling wavily, Hiding the Banksidetreestems, whose green Tops Waved soft above, kissed by the Eveningair: The Brook ran babbling on, but not for me, Its Music was the Music of past Days; I wished myself a child, to frolic still Amid the Grass, with Power to feel and see The Beauty of the Dayseye at my Feet: But 'twould not be: the pure celestial Dew That fell on Bud and Leaf, fell not on me; Nor wonder: can a tuneless Instrument Make Music, or a Heart that's not at one Within itself, be fitted for high Joys And sweet Perceptions of the inner Life? The Eyelid of the Secondsight was closed, And I could see no deeper than the Eye, The outward Eye, and in the Forms of Things, Which on my Sight as on a mirror fell, Flung coldly back from Apathy's dull Foil, Alone I had my Beingâ thus awhile Earth's Weight lay heavy on my Spirit, Past And Future, its high Heritage were gone; And my daywearied Senses, like mere Slaves, When the high Masterspirit is away, No more selfharmonized, performed their Tasks From mere brute Instinct, and with lacklove Zeal, Like base Mechanics, allunconscious of The higher Offices to which the Soul Makes their low Toil subservient; by these It with the outward World holds Commune, shapes And blends its rich Materials at Will, After the Beautymould which in himself Each in his own Degree possesses, more Or less imperfect, as the inner Eye Has kept the Heavenarchetype in View, Or lost its glorious Amplitude of Ken By Worship of Earthsformsâ by these the Soul A Portion of its own Eternity Imparts to passing Things, and gives to that Which lives in Time and Space, a higher Scope, A nobler Being like the life of Soul. Thus divine Truths under the Shape of Words, (Else Signs of perishable earthly Things) Are as a Soul embodied for the Use And Wellfare of Mankind, and in this Form They pass from Lip to Lip, from Heart to Heart, By these the great of old still speak with, and Like Spirits hover near us, still work out The godlike End which occupied their Lives. Thus from the Stone too, the creative Hand When mindimpelled, can call high Fancies forth, And plant a Soul, as 'twere, within a Shape Of Beauty; Lips which without voice yet speak, And which had they all Power of Words at Will, Yet in the Limits of Man's narrow speech, Moulded by Hopes and Fears, and mortal Joys, Could not comprize the mighty Truths which live In them, as they themselves within the Block, Unto the spellbound Gaze of Genius, Ere yet his chosen Hand has called them forth. And as the chosen Hand was needed there So here the chosen Ear, whose ample Scope Athwart Earth's fleeting, feverish Sounds has caught The calm, deep Music of Eternity, Coming upon it with the solemn Flow As of deep Waters, not in Tumult loud, But strong in their own calm Immensity! Thus in the outward Ear and Eye, the soul Infuses its own Vastnessâ in the Wind We hear mysterious Voices, which declare Whither it goes, and whence its Spirit comes; And in the Mountainecho, when dim Night Has peopled Rock and Cave, and fabulous Spring, With her wild Progeny, and haunts the Heart With Looks and Voices from departed Years, No merely mortal Accents do we hear But Spirit answers Spirit, Soul with Soul Has its high Commune, and the Voice we hear Is Nature calling to her erring Child, The Yearning of her mighty Heart towards A Heart that throbs in Unison with hers, Beating upon her universal Breast, And finding there the Peace which it had lost. Thus too when by the Grave of those we love We kneel in Grief, which yet is not Despair, For from our mortal Yearnings, from the Joys Which Death has trodden in the Dust, arise More spiritual Thoughts, above the Reach Of Chance and Change; from perishable Things Imperishable spring, as Flowerscents Free them selves from their dustborn Dwellingplace, And mingling with a purer Element, Are lost to Earth, and given back to Heaven; Thus as we kneel upon the fatal Brink, Which tho' scarce sixfeetdeep, yet severs more Than Seas or Mountains, and as the chill Earth Falls with its solemn Warning, from the Grave The Ashes speak, if we have Ears to hear. They tell us that as Dust must unto Dust, So Soul shall unto Soul; the Air doth claim Its own, the Earth its own, and Heaven too Demands what it has given.â Naught is lost: For in this mighty Whole Death has no Share, Tho' Change has much: there is no Death, save that AccomplishÃ«d by Sin, which kills the Life Of Life, and like the Worm within the Seed, Gnaws at the Growth of an Eternity. And as these Truths come from the eloquent Grave, Whose still, small Voice above Earth's empty Noise And Nothingness is heard: and as the Priest His Â«AmenÂ» says, an Echo from the Tomb, From out that other World is given back; Which at such Moments, when the Littleness Of weekdaylife no longer cramps us, deigns With human Hopes and Fears to sympathize. Oh! yes, the Ear by Faith is priviledged To hear such Echoes from the silent Grave; 'Tis God's own Voice, which to the contrite Heart Speaks of a coming Rest, a blessed Peace, Forefelt in that calm Voice, to be enjoyed There, whence that Voice proceeds; that blessed Place, Where seeing all Things as they truly are, We shall no longer mourn for seeming Loss. Oh! yes, such Answers to the Soul are given, And oh why not? shall this dull, senseless Earth Give back our Body's Voice, and shall the Soul Have less high Priviledge? if visible Nature Thus sympathize with that which perishes, Shall the invisible World not sympathize With the Unperishing? nor recognize The Voice that calleth for an Oracle, When meaner Shrines are dumb? when Reason fails And earthborn Wisdom on the Future throws A darkling Light; when Faith alone can solve The Mystery of our Being, and uplift The Veil which hides th'Enigma of this Life. Yea! it does sympathize, and oft our Souls Are snatched from this dull, weary World, this Scene Of Discords, Contradictions infinite, That make Hope sick, and Reason but a Jest, And Faith a sore footweary Pilgrim towards The shrine of Truth, and lifted for awhile Into a pure and ampler Air, to draw The Breath of Life, and tastethe Fountainhead Of the Lifewaters, gushing as of yore From 'neath the Throne of the Eternal God, The God who is before all Worlds, all Times, As full and deep as when in Spirit there We were but one with the great Whole, like Rays Not yet sunsevered, nor as yet enclosed In this Claytenement. â Oh Miracle Of Miracles, which God herein has wrought For us, as if in every Breast he sought To place a Witness of his Wonderworks! And yet we look abroad, Doubt's dimeyed Slaves For Testimonies, which we in us have Tho' we feel not: Oh wonderful! that that Which is Eternal, can be made to seem Timelimited; which having been before This antique Earth was made, with all her Flowers, Her pleasant Valleys and cloudcleaving Hills, Her fabulous Ruins, in the Shadow wrapt And Glory of the Past, as Shapes in Dreams, Her Skeletons of eldtime Cities, where The Owl and Ivy rule, her foreworld Piles Of Giantmould: her hoar Antiquities Of memorybaffling Age, to which the Tongue Of grey Tradition scarce assigns a Date: Like an old dotard Nurse, whose Lip forgets The Name of him whose Infancy she reared! And which Man in Selfignorance calls old; Oh wonderful, that having been before This antique Earth was made, this Earth wherein As her own earthborn Offspring we succeed Each other Race by Race, and sink to Dust In her own Bosom, tho' we come from far; Oh wonderful that this should have no Note Of what it was before, tho' having been, And being yet to be, cannot foreknow Its own Hereafter! tho' with Time and Space It has nought common, save this crumbling Clay, Its Prison, or its Dwellingplace as haps, For some brief fourscore Years of mortal Time, As the Clock reckons it, tho' in our Souls We have another measure, and fullwell We know that both the Reckoner and Reckoned Are of this fleeting Â«NowÂ», and with th' Eterne Have nought to do!â We are a Mystery to our ownselves; For we have that within, which is selfhid In its own Vastnessâ the Contained is far More vast than what contains it; wonderful! Nay, wonderbaffling Thought! yet not less true! Miracle worthy of the boundless God! To limit that which is Eternal and Illimitable itself, in mere Time And Space, themselves but Parts of that they bound! Our Souls are like the Waters of a Stream, And without Consciousness, save in themselves And of the Present, from their Fountainhead Flow on to the Lifeocean; nor 'till then, 'Till mingled with the mighty Whole, have they Knowledge of that same Whole, nor any clear Or certain Notion of their Journeysend! Then take not Cognizance of outward Things, And all this Jugglery of Ear and Eye, As dull Impediments to ampler Faith, But as least Portions of a wider Sphere, Higher Relations and Realities, Compared with which these fleeting outward Forms Are but as crumbling Dust and Shadows vain! There is a higher World! but here below We dwell with Chance and Change, 'mid idle Forms, Mid Fears and Vanities, a Phantomtrain, Peopling all Space with Shapes that should not be Beneath God's blessed Daylight. Grief and Pain, Almost as constant as our Shadows, walk Beside us, and, like them, but Shadows oft Caused by ourselves, while with Joy's smiling Mask Stern Disappointment meets us, when we deem The Shape of full Fruition in our Arms. The Music of Lifesdance fulloft doth change, And we must change our Step with it; 'tis now A Birthbell ringing out so merrily As tho' Grief ne'er had laid his palsied Hand Upon a Bellrope, or a Grave been dug By that old Sexton, Timeâ and now it is A Marriagebell, as noisy, brief and vain, As are the feverish Joys, to which, alas! Too oft, it lends its hollow Tongue; that Tongue To which all Accents are indifferent. And hark! again it changes, 'tis the Sound That makes the Heart beat, and the big Tear start. And so we dance along to the Gravesbrink, Wherein we are forgotton: where the Coil Of all our Hopes and Fears in Sixfeetspace Is cast aside; and in a few, brief Days, The Weeds of rank Forgetfulness shoot up O'er us and our frail Works, if for ourselves Alone we toil; if in the Works of Him, Whose Works alone endure, from Stars and Sun Down to the Dayseye of the Field, we have Not earned Faith's Wages, by the Labours of The Soul admitted to His Sabbathrest! But in this Field of Time we must not hope To reap our Harvest, for the Seeds we sow, Tho' planted here, for others yield their Crop, As we too reaped what others sowed for us: That men may be bound all together by Wise mutual Dependence, each on each, And labour not from vulgar Motives, but From godlike Gratitude to those who went Before them, and from Love to those who come; And as the Fruittree gathers from the rank And common Soil, the Sap which it transforms, First into leafy Branches, then to Blooms With Heavenodors teeming, and at last To precious and highflavored Fruits that have No Taste of Earth, so let our Souls create, (For such transforming Power they possess) From earthly Yearnings and from downward Bents Of these frail Senses, purified by Love And constant Faith, and Hope of Things to be, A higher Beauty, and the Elements Of a more noble Being, even here! Then let us on, and fear not; Faith will still Her steady Helphand lend, to aid us up The seemingrugged Path which to the Shrine Of Virtue leads; from whence on this vain World In Calmness we look down: this World, whose Noise And Uproar, distancelost, (like that of Waves Buffeting some tall Cliffsfoot, unheard by him Who meditates above) disturb no more. Such were my Thoughts, but soon farvisioned Sleep Fell on me, and again the Eyelid of The Secondsight was raised; and when I woke A Wonder had been worked for me, I was An altered Man, and lovely as my Dream, In Moonlight bathed, as if from mine own Soul Poured over all I saw, the Scene which so, So lately I felt not, before me lay. 'Tis strange! a Dream can replace in the worn And searÃ«d Breast the Heart of Childhood, take Our Illthoughts from us: in the primal Mould Of Nature, as it were, recast, and bring Out fresh and clear the godlike Lineaments, The Likeness of the Maker in the Soul! Oh! wonderworking Sleep, in thee we grow Akin unto celestial Mysteries, And the Partitionveil is drawn aside 'Twixt this World and the next. Time is no more, Time, who is to Eternity, scarce what The Minute which the Clock doth measure out Is unto Time: 'tis the frail Sense that counts The Seconds and the Moments, and by them Marks out its Growth, and dates its fleeting Joys, And Hopes: the Fall of kingdoms, Cities, Thrones, Which sprang in Time, and in Time have their End! But the Soul knoweth nought of Time and Space Save by the Body; therefore in our Sleep We pass beyond Time's Bounds, to that far Past Beyond all Memory, which as a Dream Within a Dream, or Life within a Life, Rises before us in our Sleep, a sweet And solemn Vision, full of Blessedness. And tho' 'tis lost to us when we awake, Lost to the coarser Sense, by which we when Awake half live, whereas we when asleep Live quite withdrawn from that, live as the Soul, Simply the Spirit which we are, that is Live most ourselves, yet still its Blessedness Hangs, like sweet Perfume, round us, and is as A pure Renewal of our former Selves, Th' Eternal Self, to which each passing Deed, Act, Thought, Volition, are but as the Leaves Which the Tree casts, to clothe itself with new And better â 'Tis a Breathing onceagain Of pure, untainted Etherâ â This is Life, This is to be, not seem, as we do here; And oh! why not?â for what is Life? to eat, To drink, to feel and move? from Day to Day Drag on the Chain of this our sensual Being, Struggling with this frail Flesh, which we would fling Aside in Scorn, yet cannot: oft subdued By that which we despise: oft in the Dust Compelled to grovel, when our Souls would soar. To have the Will, and want the Power to do What our proud Thoughts would prompt, and be constrain'd To quench the Thirst of Immortality, With the stale, vapid, dreggish Beverage, Which weekday Life holds to our sickening Lips. To seem awake, yet know that we are not, To dream with open Eyes, and walk in Sleep, With a faint memory of having been Awake, yet when or where scarce guessing, to Dream in our Dream that we are dreaming, and In order to convince ourselves thereof To touch and feel, and say, Â«this is a Stone, It pains me if I kick it with my Foot.Â» But thereby to dispel the second Dream Alone and not the first, tho' that was real, And 'this a most vain Dream, to rub our Eyes, And seem convinced of Life's Reality, Yet feel it a mere Mockery of that Which might be: to have soaring Thoughts and Hopes, Yearnings and Faculties that cannot free Themselves from their strange Bonds: to break our Hearts With fretting at the Bars of this poor Cage, This World, whose Chrystalbell emprisons us, Transparent, but alone to him without, Who sees, himself unseen, all that's done here, Who fills it with his Light, in that concealed; This is not Life, for we have not been blest To the full measure of Capacity; We have but sipped the Goblet we would drain! And that which Life holds out to us, alas! Is honeyed at the Brim, but as we drink Deathbitter grows, and Death itself too lurks Like Poison 'mid the Dregs: this is not Life; For ere man sinned, Death was not made to be The natural Goal of Being: Death and Sin Came hand in hand into this happy Earth; Sin, Life's worst Foe, hereditary Taint Poisoning the first pure current of the Blood, And like a Palsy, shaking from Joy's Hand The bright lipkissing Goblet, 'till his Frame, Once perfect, wasted silently away, Down to the wormy Graveâ Oh God, thou know'st That which is Life, and without thee is none, Darkness, utter Darkness, and Despair! By Disobedience have we forfeited Our once celestial Heritage; yet thou In Mercy, to our Dreams dost grant at Times Gleams of old Glory, Visitings of bright Elysian Beauty thro' these Mists of Time: There do we taste of Joy in one brief Hour More than a waking Life, where Drop by Drop The Bliss is still doled out by niggard Time, Each by a Galldrop followed: here we have An ampler Sovereigntyâ Ear and Eye Are noble Faculties, but what are they Compared with that which is sole Source of Sight, Of Hearing, and of all Perception too. That without which they are but useless Tools, Inert, superfluous; the Soul resumes Its Functions: the high Sovereign in himself Unites all Powers of all Faculties; And shall the Master not surpass the Slave? Shall the Tool have more Power than the Hand That makes it of avail? or the brute Hand Surpass the Will which motions and controuls, The Mind which quickens it? the Soul needs not The fabled Carpet to abridge its Way: It envies not the Eagleswings, the Eye Of the cloudpiercing Hawk, the Lionsstrength, Nor any Shape of palpable Perfection: These are but limited, but wonderful When measured by the fleeting Forms of Earth. The Soul has other Gifts; and in our Sleep It has not these five Faculties alone, It is all Faculty, perfect, infinite. There do we meet, ('neath calm and sunny Skies, Whose Beauty Storm defaceth not, fit Type Of that internal Calm which Virtue gives) The Beings we have loved in other Days, Arrayed in Forms not subject to the Worm, Beyond the Sway of Time; clear, sunny Brows, Where never Care has ploughed a furrowed Line, And Eyes more lovely than the Eveningstar. And they do welcome us with Lips that make The balmy Air more balmy, with sweet Words In a soft unknown Tongue, and nought akin To this frail Language of vain Hopes and Fears, A calm and blessed Utterance, which yet As by an Intuition nnderstood, Fills us with Joy, and Love and Blessedness: Like Greetings after Absence to the Home Where we first drew the Breath of Infancy. Oh sin not, that these blessed Visions be Not snatched from your dim Eyes: for gentle Sleep, Who cradles on her Breast the guiltless Babe And makes its Pillow soft as Down, and sends Her Dreams, like Sunrays, mantling o'er its Head, She to dread Conscience lends her ministries, And plants the pleasant Pillow, which should be Our natural Refuge from Life's chilling Cares, Full of sharp Thorns, and summons to our Eyes Those baleful Shapes, from which by waking Day We seek for Shelter in the Noise and Laugh And Whirl of giddy Life, thus drowning Thought By desperate Effort of the restless Will. But in our Sleep the Will is powerless To strive with Conscience, aweful Monitress! The Senses, and their idle Jugglery No longer operate, but all Things are, Beauty is Beauty, Truth is Truth, and Sin Is Sin, revealed in full Identity; God is most in us, when we thus become Most spiritual: then may we recieve High Revelations: renovating Breaths Of Inspiration; what in us is dark, May then be lightened, what is low, refined And purifiedâ but he who has defiled Himself will sleep in vain, his Dreams will be Of Earth, and as th'Avenger, God appears. By Day the World lays on us its dull Load Of Cares and Sorrows, we are Thralls of Earth, And Faith must struggle for the Victory With palpable oppressions, which subdue The Spirit's Elasticity: and Sense With all its manyfold Annoyances Is up in Arms, or Pride and chilling Doubts, Selfconfidence and Overanxiousness, The Stir of Passions, and the opposÃ«d Strain Of busy varying Opinions make Us unfit Vessels for celestial Truths. But in our Sleep as Infants we become, Passive as Clay within the Potter's Hands, And thus the Lord loves best to find us; yea! For he eschews the Pride of Intellect, That with his Oracles loves still to mix Its vain Imaginations, and pervert The pure Simplicity which dwells in them To Wisdom after the frail Flesh, with Show Of Words enticing, Lures of subtle Speech. Therefore doth He prefer to enter in The simple Heart that passively receives His Oracles, not testing them by Rules Of vain Schoollogic, and that Backwardness Of Doubt which wants the common medium And Faculty for comprehending Truth, For the worst Blind, are those who will not see, And these not even Christ himself could cure: But which by Wish to find the Truth, endowed With Faith in that same Truth, from Love thereof Draws an heartfelt Conviction, far beyond The subtlest and most logical Result Of cold, distrustful Reason, scarceconvinced In Selfdespite, his Pride reluctantly Yielding a forced Assent, that never bears The good Fruit grafted on the Heart's belief. Therefore God rather by the Babesmouth speaks, By the Simplicity of Ignorance, Than by the proud Philosopher's vain Lip, The Wisdom of the Flesh, which needs must prove That God exists, as if to feel him, and By feeling him to be Godlike, that is To be himself in us, were not the best Of proofs! which not content to feel him so, So grandly in the Heart, nor capable Of Thinking great enough to feel him there Sublimely, palpably, must needs reduce That godlike Consciousness of him into A Syllogism, into Terms precise, Â«Major and minor,Â» and that instead of The Heart, the sublime Syllogism which He himself framed to hold the living Proof, Mightiest Philosopher! how unlike those Who in their Reasonings forget him, who Is the First Cause: the one grand Â«Major TermÂ» Without which there is neither Reasoning, Nor Sense, nor Truth! but these would mystify His simple Word: so simple because it Is so, so true: so grand because it is So simple, that a little child needs but A Heart to comprehend it, needs but do His Word to prove it! yea! they mystify His sublime Word, because they have not learnt To think yet grand enough of Him, nor com- -Prehend his Works; that they may have wherewith To exercise their Ingenuity, Their Quips and Quibbles, and perplex the Mind With vain unprofitable Doubts on Points To Disputation indispensible, As to Salvation needless: for that lies In being Godlike, and in doing it, And if we feel ourselves Godlike, need we Thy Syllogisms then to tell us that We are so, or to make our Feelings real? The Tear within the Eye, the swelling Heart, These are our Proofs and others need we none! Then keep your Syllogisms, keep them for Your Humes and Gibbons, who when they have proved With these all that they can, have proved alone That they felt not the Godlike, God! that He Existed not to them; else would their Lips Have glowed, and Bosoms kindled at his Name As mine do even now, tho' far beneath Them in vain Intellect! but that is no, No Reason under Heaven why we should Not feel him livingmost in our own Hearts, For if we feel him, then is He quite near Yea! in us: should God for such Reasons not Exist to us? or should the Thought of Him For this, be less to us whom he has made To think and do the Godlike, than unto The Flower of the Field, which knowing nought Of Gibbons and of Humes fulfills in its Own silent Wise a godlike Mission too, Untroubled by the Shadow of a Doubt? Then leave us but our Feelings and the God Within our Breasts, we ask no more than this, And with this there is nought, methinks, to ask! This is the godlike Way of proving God! Then let all prove him so; yea! let all be Godlike in Thought and Deed, for so long as They are godlike, they must believe in him To be so, for without him they are not! Oft in my Dreams, when Prayer has soothed my Mind, Have I received by spiritual Means Celestial Consolations, illdeserved, Sweet Compensation for Time's passing Griefs: Visions ethereal rose upon the calm And solemn Midnight, o'er my pillowed Head, As to Spheremusic: Visions of the blest, Which but to look on made me happy, Forms Bright as if from the Rainbow they had stepped, Clothed with the Beauty of Eternity As with a Garment, and upon their Brows Wearing that calm and sweet Serenity, Which they who have no Fear for coming Ills, No Retrospects forlorn, alone can knowl; Oh there are Glimpses of a happier Life, The Life of Soul, of which in our sweet Dreams We have a slight Forestaste, as if 'twere given To quicken and refresh the Hope within, Which like a Lamp shut in a stifling Vault Grows dim, if air from Time to Time be not Conveyed to it. And I will still believe In spite of cold Philosophy, who loves To rob the Soul of its best Heritage, To steal the Honey from the Hive and kill Imagination's Bees, and to benumb With his Torpedo-touch the Heart that throbs In its own fancied Joy, that Dreams are Life. Is not Life Happiness, and Joy and Love? If then an idle Dream, wellrounded by An Hourslength, can crowd in that small Space Visions of Bliss beyond all Shape and Thought, Which all the choicest Moments of Delight Culled from an Age of dull Reality Could not make up in Quantity, far less In the ethereal Quality of Joy, Such as the Angelsselves would not disdain, If a brief Dream can give us this, oh who So mere a Fool, so mere a Stickler for Distinctions were there is no Difference, As to say, Â«this is but an idle DreamÂ» Because it is not palpable to Touch, As is a Chair or Table, as tho' these Had a more real Existence than our Thoughts, Because we thus can touch them with our Hands! Who would dissolve the Diamond of pure Joy In a vile Crucible, and when he saw The paltry Dust to which it was reduced, With mighty Exultation would exclaim As at a wondrous and convincing Proof, Â«Behold your Diamond, tell us now its worthÂ»? Its Worth!â to thee 'tis but as that vile Dust Which thou by decomposing it hast found, To me 'tis still the Diamond sparkling bright, Dust as you view it, but as I, a Gem More costly than Golconda's Mines can yield! Thou turn'st to cammon Dust, by Doubt's vile Touch, The golden Hopes and Joys of Life, while I With but a little Fancy can transform The common Dust of Circumstance to pure And genuine Gold, to Treasures of the Sky! Yea! without Metaphor, I can take up The trodden Dust within my Hand, and in The Sunbeam holding it, behold it turn To sparkling Grains of Gold; and if I do Really believe it such, what more then does The Miser in his hoarded Bags possess? And if thou must then something decompose, Then decompose thou that: Oh decompose, The glittering Baubles of this World, and thou Wilt find them, like that Miser's Gold, turn to Vile Dust, like that I hold within my Hand; Yea, and this Time, thou will not be deceived! But thou wouldst turn to Dust the holiest Things, By disbelieving them: that is the one, Most sure Way to annihilate; thou canst Not it is true destroy one least, least grain, One atom, with thy Crucibles, of all That make up this fair world; but for thyself Thou canst destroy the Godlike and the Good, Yea! God himself: for he exists no more To thee, if thou believ'st not in Him! Yea! Thou canst reduce to something less than Dust, The kiss of first, chaste Love: put out the Eye Of sublime Faith, distune the Poetsharp, Rob the Rose of its Perfume, and make Life Fall, like a withered Flower, in the Dust! This canst thou do, all this, O Man! but thou Canst work the Godlike: yea! like God himself, For He it is that works it in thee; thou C anst for thyself create the Feeling of The Godlike, and when thou hast done but this, Then hast thou too created this whole World Godlike likewise; for the world where we live, That is but the Reflection of ourselves, Our Feelings, and as these are, so is it. And if we feel Things godlike, they are so, At least to us: and after all what is The Â«Real,Â» the Â«Practical,Â» words which the loud Tongue of the World trolls forth so eloquent? That, that alone is real, which we think so, And feel so; or in other words, our own Feelings and Thoughts alone are real: unto The worldly Man, the Bag of Gold he grasps, The dainty Morsel melting in his Mouth, Are not so real, as are the Poet's Dreams, His Thoughts and Feelings, for are they not these? And what he feels and thinks, is that not real? Is it not his own Heart, himself? and when He feels the Godlike, is he not of God, Nay, God himself, as the Scent of the Rose Is the Rose itself? and what then is real If God be not, who is all Things in All? Nay, is the Tear within his Eye, the Heart That throbs and glows, not real e'en in that low- -Est Sense, which ye call real? as real as is The chair on which ye sit, the Wine ye drink. And what is practical? who clutches most Vain Shadows, ye who waste on vilest Things Divinest; ye, who pluck the blushing Rose Of Chastity from off the Maiden's Brow, Not for its divine Perfume, but to make Vile Lucre by that which the Angels in Their Wreaths might wear: who lay up what the Moth And Rust shall wear away, or he who with His godlike Feelings satisfied, goes back Unto his God, with ten instead of one Poor Talent, with a Treasure which no change Of Time and Place can rob him of, so long As he is himself, for that is his Wealth, Himself; and he who feels himself, that is The Godlike, he possesses Life's chief Good, Unrobable, and all its other Goods To this add nought, without it are all naught! And is this then a Shadow, is there aught So real to us as we ourselves, or what Is so to us, save thro' ourselves? then seek The Real, which lies within the Reach of all, For each may be himself, his whole self; yea! The Emperor on his Throne can not be more, The Beggar by the Road need not be less, Nay! even God himself, is but himself, And therefore is he God, Allgood, Allwise! But little in the World are these Truths heard, And as a Driveller my Name may pass From Mouth to Mouth, a Dreamer of vain Dreams. But I, I am awake, awake in Him Who made me, unto Him: tho' but as 'twere A mere grain in that Hand which still upholds The Stars, as countless as the Oceansands, Yet not lost to his sublime Eye, which knows No Littleness; how unlike Man who in His Pride thinks many Things so little, and Is himself little! but to God nought can Be small, for being himself in all Thing's He feels them thro' himself, and therefore feels Them godlike! Yea! I am awake: so much So that the smallest Flower at my Feet Can stir my Heart to overflowing, 'till My Spirit, like its Perfume, melts away In Blessedness and Love: how much more then Aught that concerns my Fellowcreatures! so Much that the Child's least Voice wakes into Life The whole, deep Music of Humanity! I am awake, if this be to be so; Awake ye then, who dream with open Eyes, Who seeing, see not, and with Ears cant hear; Tis Time that ye awake, ye Fools, and learn This Truth â the Value of all Things alone Lies in the Temper, with which we receive What Heaven sends us: in the Soul itself, Sought for elsewhere in vain, the fabled Stone That can transmute the common Dross of Life, Its passing Shows, its Miseries and Pains, Into pure Ore rcsides: ethereal Gift! A Boon of Blessedness, and Joy, and Peace, Which old Philosophers, with bootless Toil, Searched for in outward Things, o'erlooking still That small Space bosomed in the human Breast, The Heart, which all it touches turns to Gold; The Wiseman's kingdom, where he reigns supreme O'er Passions tamed by Reason, o'er high Hopes And calm Desires, like yon clear, still Stars, So far removed from all Mutations here; Looking beyond the Earth, therefore unmoved And undisturbed by earthly Injuries! There needs but firm Belief, to make that real Which else were but a Fancy: thus a Dream May be the Vehicle of divine Truths: Celestial Messenger, like Mercury, Tho' winged from higher Worlds than those he knew, If Faith interpret it, and it may mould Our Afterbeing, fashioning it true In the ideal Type itself supplies. For in our sleep we know not what we are Being more than what we know, and capable Of Faculties and Functions, which by Day Are likest pinioned Wings: we have, as 'twere, A Soul within a Soul, a Something which Is far too subtle to display itself By these dull Channels of the waking Sense, Which, when these, like the Clod of which they're made, Lie dead and powerless, expands and lives! EMMA A TALE. 1 Oh happy time of pure Love's first sweet kiss, When Heart beats back to Heart, and Cheek on Cheek Is pillowed at that moment of deep Bliss. When all that in our Afterlife we seek, Wealth, Worship, Glory, Power, seems a weak Ambition, undeserving of a thought; When in a few softwhisperd sounds we speak, Those broken fragments of a Joy which naught Can worthily express, for Being's self is wrought 2 Into it, and that Joy is not a part Of us, it is ourselves; the Breath whereby We live, the purest vein within the heart, Whence flow all sweet thoughts and all Fancies high, Our Hope, our Present, and our Past: the Eye Of all our Seeing, which put out, we grow Desolate as the Blind, and groping try To find the Light which erst had charmed us so Alas! the rayless orb that Light no more shall know! 3 Oh! happy time, when in the Eveningshade A white robe twinkling thro' the Leaves so green, The light step heard by Love alone, has made The heart to flutter, as tho' it had been Too scant to hold the swelling pulse within. Oh blessed Time! when but a braid of hair Is dearer in our Eyes than all the Sheen Of Wealth and Pomp; when one kiss of those fair Sweet Lips is worth all Joys that most esteemÃ«d are. 4 Oh blessed kiss! how different from that Which on a Wanton's Lips, with feverish glow, We press, whose effervescence leaves all flat And stale within the Heart; a throbbing Brow, And a sad consciousness that there is no Enjoyment save in pure and virtuous Love! But thou, thriceblessed kiss, wast brought below By a bright Angel from the realms above, To hallow, and enable Love his worth to prove! 5 The sun is setting, and the twilightshade Is deepening momently: the golden Light That slanting on the green leaves fell, and made Them glisten so transparent to the sight, Is ebbing off, or but in patches bright Lingers upon the topmost boughs, and makes Their feathery Sprays like Gold: hour of delight! Thrice welcome for thyself, and their dear sakes, Whose forms each flitting shadow as in mockery takes. 6 Sweet hour that lingerest with Eve's one star, Worth all thy Brothers of the garish Day, With thee come back the thoughts of those who're far, Far distant, like to pleasant chimes that play In Fancy's Ear, with music passed away; And Sounds of wellknown feet and Voices dear, And hallowed temples with their hair of gray, All these throng on me, filling up the drear Blank of the present Time with many a bygone Year! 7 Oh what were we, if destined not to meet Again in happier Climes? why are we made To feel these Joys, to taste the divine Sweet, And ere the Flavor from our Lips can fade, Ere our celestial thirst be halfallayed, To have the cup dashed from our hand; or why Are we with this frail Flesh and Blood arrayed, With Yearnings and Affections, if the Sky Knit not again the Links rent here untimeously? 8 Mourn not, mourn not, wipe off the starting tear, God is benificent, he gives and takes Away, as he thinks fit: the Gifts which here We at his Hands receive, for our own sakes Are fleeting Goods, and He who thereof makes The most while yet he has them, without thought When they may be recalled, is wise: God breaks The proud man's hope, and bringeth unto naught His might, that thus the world its weakness may be taught! 9 And now the palebrowed Night her mantle spread, And her starbraided Locks of Ebonhue Flowed down her shoulders: wornout Day was dead, Laid by the hours on his bier; the Blue Of Heaven, with each moment's swift wing grew Deeper and deeper, and the Echos still Listened to hear the Nightingale renew His Eveninghymn, on some woodsided hill, Where'mid the mossy Glades he haunts some babbling Rill 10 And in a starproof bower on the slope Of a green Lawn, with thick sward carpetÃ«d, And flowers which their scented Eyelids ope At the first glance of Morn, but now lay spread With all their perfumes in them treasurÃ«d, There sat a gallant Cavalier, who on The path below looked out, and listenÃ«d To every rustling Leaf and fleeting Tone That o'er the ravendownÃ«d Darkness soft was blown. 11 Aud hark! a light step falling on the ground, Like whispers upon air, a robe of white, Floating upon the Darkness, one quick bound, And they are in eachother's arms, Delight Binding their Lips together. Oh that Night Had broke the Link which knit that moment to The next and their harsh recollections: quite Severed it, so that it might ne'er renew In Afterdays the bitter thought of whence it drew 12 Its Being; why that Joy was like a Flower Trodden down in the dust, bloom, seent and seed: 'Tis o'er; the Villageclock hath struck the hour, And Time, still overbusy to take heed What 'tis he makes and mars, hath severÃ«d Those hearts, as unconcernedly as two Sandgrains in his own glass, alas! a reed Shaken by every wind is manslove; true But as the Weathercock, to Fancy's changing hue. 13 And they have parted, and the years fly on, Like Parthians wounding us e'en when past by: Burying the Â«LovelyÂ» in oblivion, Drawing a dull film o'er Joy's oncebright Eye, Making the pulse that beat so boyantly As like a minuteglass as well can be: Then let us with the jealous years too fly; Reader, much change they'll work in thee and me, And some perhaps e'en while I tell this History 14 Of two forgotten beings, who belong To the past Time; whose bones long, long ago Have mouldered, and whose forms amid the throng Are no more seen: their phantoms here I show Like passing shadows which vain mortals throw Upon the Ground, then lost for evermore, Just like themselves, Shadows of Shades! e'en so! And now the Scene must change; years have rolled o'er, And these are now no longer what they were before. 15 He in far foreign Lands has roved, and there Forgot his plighted Faith, and broke the ties Which bound his heart unto that maiden fair: Had slept o'ercanopied by Victory's Proud banners, and beneath their sanguine dyes His dreams were tinged with that same hue, and he Awoke another Man: his sympathies Like Tendrils rudeuntwisted from the Tree Where first they grew, were scathed, and left it sad to see! 16 But now he was come back, and wellknown sights Relinked the broken Chain of Memory; And frequent tokens of those pure delights Which he had tasted once, ere yet the high And divine thirst of blessed Sympathy Was sated by unholy means, (which make Our lips for that Ambrosia of the Sky Unfit), had still the power to awake Old thoughts and cheated hopes, yet these were like the snake 17 Hid 'neath the very sweetness of the flower, And poisoning the honeydrop with gall And bitterness. Oh memory! thy power Is fearful when we sin â thou canst recall Past forms of Loveliness, searing the Eyeball That looks on them: but she he sought was gone, And nowhere to be found: he searchd thro' all The wellknown haunts, and heard that she was flown Into a Nunnery disconsolate, and lone. 18 And having learnt this, he devised a Scheme, A Scheme of Violence: for in those Days E'en deeds of Blood were no Romancer's dream, And the strong hand had ever means and ways To work out what it planned: when the sword sways The balance of weak Justice, and Gold buys Off Crime, and all its Terrors Law arrays Against the feeble, then the Man who tries His cause with these good helps is sure to win the prize. 19 And soon among his reckless followers He found fit instruments: Men in War's trade Inured to Blood, who with a pair of spurs And a good steed short work had often made Of Right and Wrong, straight calling to their aid The sword, that best of Lawyers when they could Not with their wits untie the knot: these bade He be in readiness: resolved he would Carry her off by force, hap what might, Ill or Good. 20 Come sit thee, Reader, down upon this height, A grassy knoll thy seat, and thou shalt see Thro' the old Trees, whose boughs are stirred so light By Morning's balmy breath, halfsleepily, A Landscape, fair and broad as any be; Ask me not whether it exist: 'tis thine; I would but play a harmless Jugglery, And if thou hast the faculty divine, Come then and be a fellowtraveller of mine! 21 I would but bid thee open up thine Eyes And have a little Faith, a little Grain Of fearless Faith, and thou shalt see arise Pure forms of Loveliness, which else in vain Thou must seek for. Oh count it very gain, If, on Life's dusty track, where evil sights And sorry spectacles allied to Pain And Discontent are rife, to Fancy's heights Thou with bold wing mayst soar, and still preserve thy rights, 22 Thy noblest heritage! come shut thine Eye, Thy sensual Eye, if in four narrow walls, Like a caged Bird, thou feel'st thy sick heart sigh For Nature's music: voice of waterfalls Sent clear up into the empyreal Halls From the dark dizzy depths where straining sight Can track them not: or Echo when she calls From some old Cavern in the dim twilight, Wandering wheree'er she lists, a disembodied sprite 23 That communes with our soul, and answers back From out that other World, whereof she is A denizen: of these thou shalt not laek, Nor any other shape of choicest bliss; Come with me, and thy parchÃ«d Lips shall kiss The very Helen of thy sweetest dream: Thou shalt have Nectar, aye, and more than this; Shalt drink it with a zest that might beseem The God who of all Joys bestows the very Cream. 24 Wings hast thou! open up thine Eyes: not these Poor Orbs, which ever in the same dull round Look on the same dull features, where Disease And palelipped Grief, and aguish Fear have found Their fittest Emblems: from the depth profound Of human Misery soar far away, Unlid the sight whose wide gaze has no bonnd And view the source of that diviner Day, Which sheds on all things Beauty's calm, unchanging Ray! 25 And lo! the shaping Winds have blown aside The blossomstirrÃ«d boughs of that fair Tree, As if to open up a prospect wide Of all the fairyscenes which stretch in free Expanse into the distance: see, oh! see, How charm on charm crowds forward as to meet The halformed wish ere into shape it be Embodied by the Thought, with forms more sweet Than we ourselves had dreamt, the wondering Eyes they greet! 26 Oh! Fortunatus, tell me true, what was Thy Wishingcap to this? an idle dream! Bnt this is a bright Truth, which each man has The power to realize, and so redeem His soul from Thralldom; for it doth not seem, But is, if we have Faith to take it so. A Dream, a Fancy, if we rightly deem, Is real as any fact, if we know how To profit by it, and enjoy it ere it go. 27 Sneer not thou proud Philosopher amid Thy Books and Skeletons, with puckered brow And spectacles on nose: much still is hid From thee which thou art far too wise to know: Truths felt by simple Hearts alone, which no Dull Syllogism's grasp can e'er comprize. The world in which thou liv'st, how scant and low Compared with this! thou all things dost despise Which Doubt's vile Crucible cant sift and analyze! 28 Thou knowst not what a curse it is to be Thus overwise. Oh! better far it were To be the slave of mere Credulity Believing all things, than thus to lay bare Brain, Nerve, and Organ, seeking vainly there To solve a riddle placed beyond man's Lore: Better believe in Fancies vain as air, If by so doing we become far more Rich and contented than with all Earth's glittering store. 29 Dull Fools! what tho' the soul itself could be With Thumb and Finger like a sinew caught, Or fix'd upon the knifespoint palpably, What pleasure could ye draw from such a thought More than at present? would it be in aught More yours, exist more truly? do ye know What Life and Spirit mean? a cloud is naught But vapor, yet if ye have wisdom so To see it, from a Cloud no unreal Good may flow. 30 Oh wretched Man, how worse than poor is he Who has not in his soul that which can make Even a Cloud a source of Joy to be Garnered up for the future: who can take From it no pleasant thought, nor for its sake Ere from the bright blue vault it melts for aye, Would kneel to him, who e'en with it can wake The soul to Blessedness and Love, nor say, Let me ne'er see a Cloud and turn unmoved away! 31 Oh! lovely vision, with the pencil drawn Of high Imagination, tho' nowhere Found upon Earth, yet still the hues of Morn Not less embathe thy fields and groves so fair. Not less the Flower to the summerair Gives forth its perfume, and the hills recede In distance to the blue horizon, there Blent with the Clouds and Sky; I see indeed, I feel thee not the less, nor other proofs I need. 32 From yon' tall Mountainsfoot, that runs into A sea of verdure, like a headland high And bold, a fair plain stretches, with each hue Of Cornfield, grove, and grass, alternately Mingling their tints: yet ever broken by Some pleasant Rise, that bosomlike upswells To give the charm of Halfobscurity That Fancy may run wild among the dells Which lurk between, and hear the unseen Villagebells. 33 And all around that Plain high Mountains spread Their girdle, like a hallowed spot, to keep It sacred from Intrusion: on his Bed Of Snow, old palsied Winter still doth sleep, While Summer revels in the valleys deep, And on the sunny slopes encroaching near And nearer with his flowers up the steep And barren realms, where Frost and Tempest drear Have left wild records, sporting with their playmate Fear! 34 And on a gentle slope towards the End Of that wide plain, an antique Abbey stood Upon an Island, where two streamlets blend To moat it allround with their chrystal flood, That oft came tumbling down in angry mood, Two Mountaintwins, brought forth with tempestthroes: Its towers shot up deepnavelled in a wood, And the old stonework grey and mossy rose, Contrasted with the flakelike foliage green and close: 35 And one old gnarlÃ«d Oak, whereon the storm Had lightningwrit fullmany a fearful note Of his wild presence, with its aged form Coeval with the abbey, from the moat (The Mirror where its Image aye did float Unflattering as Time's own glass,) rose by The eastern Window from all noise remote Save of the stream and nightwind moaning nigh, Or the fullvoicÃ«d quire pealing solemnly. 36 It was a Gothic Window of vast size And manystainÃ«d glass, that broke the Light Of Heaven into a thousand gorgeous dyes, Rich as the Peacock's plumage: and by Night The Fullmoon streaming thro' it, broad and bright, Cast on the Marblefloor a checquered shade, 'Till each dim figure seemed a moving sprite; For as the Wind amid the foliage played Of that old Tree, the Shadows on the ground were swayed 37 Backward and forward, like an Arras quaint Worked by some pious hand in olden day, And fluttering in the Taperlight so faint: And round that Window dim and dusk and grey The stone in rich festoons was made to play, By some forgotten Sculptor's chisel fine Wrought soft as Wax: and Redcrossknights there lay Dust for Oblivion, enough to line A Coffin's chinks: their swords which once drank blood like Wine 38 Rusting beside them, and their bold arms layd Crosswise upon their breasts: so perishes The glory of a name when it is made To link itself with deeds which Truth denies, Tho' their vain Glitter dazzle Folly's Eyes: Time's mighty wheel rolls on, and flings aside The dust which it has gathered: Kingdoms rise And stand a moment on it in their pride, Then pass; the changeless Centretruths alone abide. 39 And here in this old Abbey, where all things Seemed of another world, an Atmosphere So quiet, as might tempt an Angelswings From time to time to drop from his own clear, Untroubled Ether to hold commune here With some blest spirit, purified by Pain From mortal soil: to kiss away the Tear, And bear it back with him to Heaven again, A token that his visit had not been in vain. 40 There Emma, from the world and its rude strife, Young, yet alas! for Grief who ever was Too young, or who that drank the cup of Life Found it allsweet? if Fate in mockery has Not mixed Pain's bitter med'cine in the glass, And honeyed but the rim with Pleasure, still Some hand which haply of all others as The dearest was esteemed, the Cup shall fill With that slow poison which is ever sure to kill! 41 For there are many ways of murdering, Where haply not one drop of Blood is spilt; Yet these frail mortal Justice cannot bring Within her Laws, tho' greater be the Guilt, Far more the pain than if up to the hilt A Dagger had been thrust thro' the heartscore! That is a passing pang: the blow is dealt, And after a brief sigh the smart is o'er, And the poor throbbing pulse lies still for evermore! 42 But the worst Murderer of all is he Who turns Love's deep Devotion and Delight, By harsh neglect, into an agony Far sharper than the edgÃ«d sword to smite The soul, wherein all pure affections might Have blossomed forth like fruits of Paradise: Unnatural Transformation! thus to blight The Heart e'en thro' that very Love which lies Deep at the root of Joy, and without which it dies. 43 There Emma had retired, there she drank Of fount's that heal, from Faith's own living Well; And when the quiet of the Place had sank Deep in her spirit, like a holy spell It worked in her a blessed miracle. Like all around she calm and quiet grew: With Nature's mighty Heart her own did swell, Its feverish Pulse was gently tuned anew, And now it beat with Her's responsively, and thro' 44 Each vein of Being sent that blessed Peace, That Health, which from the Centre flows alone, Like the lifesap which circulates in trees, Without which fruit and flower are unknown, And barren unto Joy we linger on Forlorn, alive but to the sense of Pain. There in the dimlit cloisters had she won Possession of herself, and reaped again The Interest on that treasure which so long had lain 45 Nigh unproductive to her Maker's praise, Noughtyielding, like vile buried Gold; thus she In Prayer and sublime Hope had passed her Days. Meanwhile the Sun, from clouds and mists set free, The skirts of Night's dark Robe, rose from the sea, The azurebosomed, heaving in the Light Of the young Day: and antique Cybele With all her features caught the radiance bright, And from her mighty breast its thousandvoiced delight 46 Was poured forth in the Streams and on the Air, And in the Song of Birds, and in the sound Of rustling leaves, and in all things that share The gift of Utterance, or sense profound Of that allsweetest hour, when around Aurora from her dewy Lip breathes on Herb, Grass, and Flower, 'till the common ground Smells sweet as Eden itself might have done, When Angels trod its paths, and Peace dwelt there alone 47 Just o'er the Hill, where down towards the vale The road winds o'er its brow then disappears With sudden turn, protected by a rail From the deepyawning chasm, which there rears Itself into an abrupt Wall, and wears The aspect of a work of art, yet is Wrought but by Nature's silent hand, which bares Its operations not: where should you miss One step, you would be hurled into the dark abyss, 48 On which, e'en at midday, thick Darkness broods On undisturbÃ«d wing, and voice is none, Save the deep thunder of the unseen floods Which in the womb of Night go tumbling on: Just there, the morningsunrays glancing, shone Upon a clump of Spears appearing o'er The Hilltop, but the dust which was upthrown By the Steedshoofs, concealed them, and before The Wind dispersed it, they were visible no more. 49 But lo! another winding of the Road Has brought them into view: a warlike Band With burnished Helm and Breastplate, who have rode At a sharp gallop, for the foamflecks stand On the steed's veinÃ«d necks, and with his hand The leader points towards the Abbeytowers Clear in the distance, and his white plume fanned Waves lightly on the breeze; Â«'tis but an hour's Hard riding, and the prize shall then be surely ours, 50 With these words to his Charger he sets spurs, And onward dashes down the rocky way Regardless of the Steep: his followers Scarce keeping up with him: some loth to play Their new part in the Drama of that Day, For they were Superstition's sons: and tho' They feared not Man nor Devil, dared not lay On Holy Motherchurch a finger: so They crossed themselves full oft, and in their prayers cursed low. 51 See, see, they've reached the plain, and from that ridge Of wooded height they gallop down, and lo! To the Steed's iron tread the antique bridge Rings loud and clear: and the still stream below The passing Image from its breast doth throw For a brief moment, then gives back again The calm pure Ether, and along doth flow With wonted quiet, as no shadow vain Of this strange fleeting Life in its clear glass had lain! 52 Which, like Time's mirror, gave the perfect form And feature of the moment: lo! 'twas there, In all its noise and nothingness, a storm Of fury meaning naught; and now, 'tis where? No Trace remains of it: 'tis gone; the air Hath buried those wild sounds as in a grave, And the calm water's breast is clear and fair From its pollution. Nature will not save That Image of Decay, nor deign to let it have 53 A Dwelling with her quiet Elements, A longer Recognition: and lo! now The dust is rising 'neath the Battlements Of yon' old, ruined Watchtower on the Brow Of the green mound, that o'er the plain below Gives a far prospect; on at slackened rate They gallop, and are entering into The great Oakavenue of nameless Date That leads, with leafy pomp, right to the Abbeygate; 54 Whose solemn glooms fall soothing on the mind To raise and elevate, and make us feel As tho' we left the vain world's noise behind; With secret Impulse urging us to kneel In that fine natural aisle, where sunbeams steal In green and broken twilight o'er the ground; And where the Rooks, an antique commonweal, Pure Freedom, Nature's noblest gift have found, Observing her wise Laws, of Right and Wrong the Bound. 55 Â«Let the Horns speak, and with their brazen Tongues Rouse up these idle Drones betimes to Day: They should ere this be at their Matinsongs, But the Sun comes too early with his ray, And many a drowsy Friar's snore says nay Unto his Summons,Â» so the Leader spoke: And as a Pack of Hounds in Chorus bay, So forth the notes upon the still Morn broke, And every slumbering Echo in the old Wood woke. 56 And now as they rode onward to the gate, Which at the end of that old Avenue Stood, like Time's Portal, hoary with the weight Of years and recollections, leading to The realms of the grey Past, that Wizard who Rubs off the vulgar gloss, and beautifies Familiar things with quaint Tradition's hue. But thro' that gate all access he denies Save to the Poet whom he from his stores supplies! 57 And then he sends him forth to tell the tale In pleasant Rhyme of all that he saw there: Sceptres and crowns whose glory has grown pale, For the false Jewels which adormed them were Not Mercy, Truth, and Justice: thus they are Covered with dust from dull Oblivion's wing. And others shining on undimm'd and fair, Pure Jewels which a divine Lustre fling, The foremost in Time's crown, the one allpotent King! 58 And antique scrolls, inscribed with Legends hoar He there decyphers, and brings forth to day, By doting Eld with mumbling Tongue told o'er, The Echoes of whose faint voice die away Ere half her Tale be told: ere Poet's Lay Embalms, or History's slow pen saves the rest. Strange phantoms flit and vanish on his way, Forgot traditions leave their tombÃ«d rest To clothe with pristine forms Truths deep in Nature's breast. 59 Just even with the selfsame grain of sand That measured in Time's glass the moment flown For aye, as up the avenue that band Of armÃ«d Men were riding, in her gown Of Conventstuff, and with the Greyhood thrown Back from her ample brow, so pale yet fair, Into the dusky Chapel, allalone, Had Emma passed to breathe one fervent prayer, As usual, ere the Sisterhood should join her there. 60 The sun had risen, and from that same hill His beams upon the distant Abbey shone, Tinging the Towers with golden Light: yet still The Dew lay dank upon the grass unmown Of many a streamside mead, where June had strown From her full Lap, all blooms of fairest dye; And still long shadows from the hills were thrown O'er the moist valleys, tho' athwart the sky Twilight's grey mantle caught the rosehues momently! 61 And thro' the window with its pictured dyes, Its Saints and Martyrs, and rich tracery Of flowerwork, with many a quaint device, A beam of Snnshine falling holily, Lit up the face of one who knelt hardby The altar in deep prayer; a blessed ray, A recognition clear sent from the sky To tell the dawn not of the sensual day, But of that higher Light, for which her soul did pray! 62 It was a maiden's face: not many years Had writ their records on it, yet it bore A calm solemnity, as if vain fears And hopes of worldly things could stir no more. The deepblue Eye a sweetened sadness wore, As of a Sorrow conquered, if still felt; Firm Faith had tempered there with divine Lore The Earthliness of grief, and as she knelt, Her form, like Spirit's, in the sunlight seem'd to melt 63 Away: one would have hesitated to Draw near, so like a Glory round her Brow Those Beams had gathered; as if Nature, true To her high office, registered the Vow: Nor able to devise more fitly how To mark her Approbation, silently Had wove a Wreath of her calm Light, e'en now Sent direct from the Throne of the most High, A Type of that she was to wear above the Sky! 64 And had he seen her as she knelt, he would Have deemed her some bright Angel, bent to kiss Her Garmentshem â his mortal Love he could Have no more held her, nor have called her his, When Heaven so clearly claimed her to its Bliss. But now that Light has left her Brow, and lo! All that remains of the bright Vision, is The Mortal! heavenly Things but briefly show Themselves in outward Forms, they love to work below! 65 Her Orisons are done: she rises up With Breast that heaves, yet holds her not, in mien Etherealized and calm: the divine cup An Angel to her Lips had held, unseen Of all, save her whose eyes alone had been Unfilmd, and opened to that vision fair: She saw him clothed in his celestial sheen Smiling, from the Communiontable bear The Bread and Blood of Christ, and bid hertaste, and there 66 Be made in that same moment whole; and so She was: her Heart within her bosom beat Calm as an angel's, and her thoughts did grow Pure as the Light, and with a divine heat Of Inspiration fraught: but hark! in sweet Yet solemn swell the Organ's mighty Peal Now fills, (like prayer the soul), with Music meet, The soaring vault, and figures softly steal Adown the twilight aisles, and round the Altar kneel; 67 Some in longflowing Robes, like Angels carved From purest marble, with their wings of white Halfdrooping by their sides: some group'd, some halved By intervening pillars; forms of Light, Such as old Luca's Luca Della Robbia. skilful hands delight To fashion forth: sweet faces where high thought Has tuned each feature to an Emblem bright, Quiet and calm, with holy meanings fraught, To one same Divine Sentiment diversely wrought! 68 And there arose, lighstpringing from its Base Of Marble, in Compartments worked, whereon Art strove Religion's naked truths to grace With new charms from her Handmaid, Fancy, won, A Pulpit old, whence many a voice long gone Was heard, and as just dropped from Heaven, there Floated with plumes softgleaming in the Sun, An Angel with spread Wings, and Brow so clear, As if bent down to whisper in the Preacher's Ear! 69 And where the Columns from their carved base rose To prop the groinÃ«d vault, which swelling light Curved up into the Roof, there by a Rose Of sculptured stone held firmly, Emblem bright Of Wisdom ever gentle in her Might, Were Figures placed, as if to bear the Weight, Bent 'neath its Pressure in most dolorous Plight, And fallen Angels with crushed wings, by Fate Robbed of all heavenly Strength, fit Types of Sin's low state. 70 Oh! 'twas a Picture which a thoughtful mind Would revel in: a mind that loves to trace The genuine springs, which work unseen behind These noisier Elements, which are but base Spoils for Oblivion, tho' still their place Be foremost on Life s stage: the growing Light The floating Shadows softly doth efface, Darkness broods massy 'mid the roof's far height, While down the Centreaisle the sun streams broad and bright! 71 But hark! upon that deep and solemn strain, As in fullvolumed swell it upward flows, Like a sweet Incense, clearer heard again, There breaks a far, far different sound, which knows No sympathy with divine things, but shows 'Mid that bless'd music like a brazen string Upon an Angelsharp: and swift there goes From group to group a timid whispering, And the Nuns gather 'round the Altar in a ring: 72 It was a clanking tramp of horseshoofs Upon the Outcourtpavement, with a sound Of jarring Iron, from the vaulted roofs Reechoing with an hollow, strahge rebound. But of such rude Intrusion none had found Out yet the cause, and in a vague dismay Each listened, gazing momently around, As tho' the old Stonetemplars had that day Stepped from their pedestals, and met in deadly fray! 73 And lo! the Chapeldoor, flung open wide, Display'd a knight's tall form in steel array'd, And on his casque there waved the drooping pride Of a white plume, by his quick motion swayed Aye to and fro: and his mailed Righthand layd Upon his swordhilt told in silent wise, Yet eloquent, that he would be obeyed: And thro' his vizor flashed his haughty Eyes, Like a bold Falcon swooping down on its weak prize. 74 And Emma knew him â her Heart recognized Instinctively, the Man who'd wronged her so, Whom yet she loved, e'en when she most despised Him for his faithlessness: we do not know How deep within the Heart the seed doth grow, When in the first, fresh, early soil 'tis sown: We think to pluck it out, yet still below The surface, at the core, with which't has grown One Essence, some strong fibres keep their hold unknown 75 With firm step and with calm, untroubled brow, She stood before him, like a Dove before The Eagle with his ruffled plumage; no Least mark of fear her serene aspect wore, And his stern glance her meek Eye calmly bore. A strange yet lovely sight! a timid maid Secure in Innocence and fearing more For him, than for herself â a knight arrayed In war's proud panoply, yet at his Heart afraid! 76 She smiled upon him with the soft, sweet smile Of other Days, with Eyes whose holy Light Was lit at Love's pure altar, which e'en while 'Tis unrequited burns on calm and bright: And as its Beauty on the frowning knight Fell with a sweet and solemn majesty, That Doveglance, like fierce Lightning, scathed his sight, Quelling the terrors of his haughty Eye, And by his side the warrior's arm dropp'd nervelessly! 77 Vain sword and steel! vain weapon in the Hand To which the Soul its inward strength denies; Which wanting, what is the bloodthirsty brand But as a brittle Reed? â vain Power which lies In Nerve and Sinew! which a maiden 's Eyes Can wither like a palsied limb! one look, The soul's high Messenger, could paralyze The inward Man, and from the Spirit took Both Will and Power, and to its inmost centre shook 78 The seat of Being, waking on his throne The veiled Conscience, aweful Monitor! Whose face is viewless, like th'Allmighty's own! She made one step towards him, and she saw The passions paralyzed amid their war, She laid her hand on his, and it did thrill, Tho' scarcely felt, thro' all his Being: for That light Touch, like a Spirit's, could instill Into the trembling clay the motions of its will! 79 Yea! like a spirit's: for she was indeed AllspiritualizÃ«d, and she stood In that high moment from all passion freed, With naught to dim the brightness of that mood: No lingering Weakness linked with Flesh and Blood. The common Clay of coarse Mortality Was touched, etherealiz'd, and there did brood A Glory on her brow, and viewless by Her side, the Powers of Heaven lent their sympathy! 80 Abashed, the Warrior turned â his haughty Plume Drooped with the bent helm downwards, and he read In that calm, serene glance his final doom: He felt that she from him was severÃ«d, As much as if already with the dead: Like to a fallen angel he looked on Her bright form in its Ether calmensphered, Something akin to Envy seized upon His heart, to see her win this triomph all alone! 81 A moment in the Chapeldoor he stood, And looked back on that vision like a bright Opening-up into Heaven: but he could Not bear its blessedness: his earthly sight Was dazzled, and the gathering mists of Night Seem'd to obscure the Sun: he turned away, Like one shut out of Eden, and a blight Lay on his heart â he would but could not pray, And in his Soul a Change was wrought from that same Day! 82 Reader, these Forms are but as Figures made By a Phantasmagoria, briefly thrown On Time's strange Canvass: with the Light and Shade Of Fancy wrought; or like to Portraits shown On some old Tapestry, and faded grown Thro' the long Lapse of Years: at which you gaze 'Till each Face seems as that of one wellknown, And full of Recollections; Fancy plays Strange Tricks with us, and Phantoms at her will can raise! 83 Yet if I've brought a Tear into thine Eye, Or made the Human Heart within thee fear And hope, and beat with holy Sympathy, Then do they live as much as if they were Of Flesh and Blood, or thou hadst with them here On Earth been joined in Fellowship: they are No longer Phantoms, that straight disappear And are forgot, like vain forms wove of Air, But Beings in whose Joys and Pains thy Heart doth share. 84 Oh doubt it not, for what can doubt e'er do But burst the Bubble, the bright World, blown by Imagination's divine Breath? 'tis true 'Tis but a Bubble, yet before the Eye Of God what is the glorious Pageantry Of this fair Earth, but as a Bubble too? All is but Bubble bursting momently, All, save the Soul, which like a drop of Dew Exhales, thus the most real is what we least can view! 85 Behold those countless Worlds, that stud the Sky Like golden Sands strewd on some boundless shore, Have they been numbered by Astronomy? Their End and their Beginning can the Lore Of Man comprize? and yet they pass before The Allmighty, like unnumbered Bubbles, blown By the Breath of his Mouth, and are no more! Like Shadows on the clear, deep Azure thrown, While He abides, eterne, unchanging, and alone! 86 The Wonderful doth enter into all, It is Life's most familiar Element. What is more wonderful than 'neath the Pall The stirless Dead, the strange Presentiment Which fills the Bosom, as tho' thou hadst bent Down over thine own Corpse, 'till to thine Eye There starts a Tear, by Hope and Wonder sent, As if the Universal Soul had by Thy Spirit sympathized with frail Humanity! 87 All, all is wonderful; and most of all The most familiar Things: is not Life so? This Earth, the Heaven's azure, clouddomed Hall, With Stars, that, lamplike on the columns, show Its Wonders to the Eyes of Men below? The Heathens built them Temples, where they sought For Oracles and Signs, they did not know That the true Temple was already wrought, Its Vastness placed it far beyond their grasp of Thought. 88 This World is the true Temple of the true Religion, worthy of each other: here The wiseman seeks his Oracles, and to Its Highpriest turns with holy Awe and Fear; And hourly filling his capacious Ear, He catches all its mighty Harmonies: And Oracles foretell in Language clear The blessed Truth, and tho' denied his Eyes, The unknown World's best Joys his Heart can realize! 89 The Wonderful we seek not where we should: 'Tis grown a Commonplace, we pass it by; We do not draw from it one half the good We might do: we with it should beautify The Ground of Life, this harsh Reality, And make it fairer than the Poet's dream. Believe then all things calm and fearlessly! E'en that thou art an Angel mayst thou deem, For thus believing it, thou wilt be one, not seem! 90 And gentle Reader, now I bid farewell And kiss thee in all holy Love, whoe'er Thou art, some fairhaired youth still 'neath the Spell Of Fancy, wandering in Vision clear Thro' Fairyland, or one whom Hope and Fear Have stretched oft on their Rack, or grayhaired Sire; Tho' dead and gone, still am I with you here, Breathe the same Breath, and feel the same Desire; This is a Wonder too, what more can Man require! THOUGHTS ON MAN, ART AND NATURE 1 Alas! we have no longer Hearts or Ears For simple Truth: her face no more we know, 'Tis as a stranger's, which no token bears, No Sign to our dull Eyes; tho' heavensglow And radiance pure from each calm feature flow, As when our fathers in the days of yore With meek Highmindedness were wont to bow Before her Shrine; but we have other Lore, A pompous Wisdom gilded for the passing hour, 2 Whose showy Surface Time soon wears away, Leaving but worthless Dross, base Metal ne'er Stamped with Truth's Image; we have gone astray: We are the slaves of idle hope and fear, Still wavering with life's wavering current here, Like Barks that have no fixÃ«d course, no aim, Nor to one blessed haven calmly steer; Our holythings no longer are the same, Worth we exchange for show, and Glory for a name! 2 Oh why has God bestowed on us a heart To feel and love, if its best sympathies We thus pervert? why? if not to impart A rule and measure, by which the least wise, Tho' little fit t 'unravel sophistries, And Falsehood's Sphynx-Enigmas, yet may tread Surefooted still amid the web of Lies, The manymeshÃ«d net which Craft has spread, If not that the sound heart correct the erring head. 4 But we have bartered our own hearts for Shows And false presentments, and celestial things Pass now unrecognized: the worst of Woes, The worst of punishments; for vice still brings Its curse in its own hatefulness, and clings Unto our spirits like a Leprosy; Lying a leaden Weight upon the Wings With which we else might soar unto the sky, A blight upon our sense, a film upon our Eye. 5 Mammon has many temples in the land, And willing priests, besotted Votaries, Who worship him e'en where God's altars stand; And costly Sacrifices to him rise Of Things beyond all Price in wisemen's Eyes, But which Fools barter for Earth's earthliest Hire; And converts makes he with his gilded lies And hollow promises, and in the fire His votaries cast their children to this God of mire! 6 A goodly train has he: Pomp, Rapine, Lust, Selflove, with Avarice and Luxury And brute Expense, still trailing in the dust Their hideous forms, his steps accompany; His Proteusshadows: varying to the eye Of him who views them, even as he be In his own heart: a steadfast votary Of Powers felt but by him whose soul is free, Or the besotted slave of sensual Imagery. 7 Alas! the Sophist, Falsehood, has not plied His task in vain; a quick earwinning tongue, A most lieskilful Lip with words to hide And gloss all Ugliness he has, and Wrong In the unsullied garments that belong To Truth he still can deck; and he can throw Bleareyed Delusion on the grovelling throng, Who judge by outward semblances, nor know, That the heart's deepest Thoughts disdain all outward Show. 8 In simple Truth we have no longer faith, In simple thoughts and feelings which disdain All language, save the pure heartprompted breath Of that high Utterance, which will not deign To lend its hallowing to Fancies vain, For it is of the soul; and Truth doth love Not the cold pomp of swelling words that strain The empty phrase, but lips that calmly move, Whose sober utterance the high Contents approve. 9 That which is truly simple, is profound; So obvious, that he who runs may read Its meaning, and acknowledge he has found True wisdom there, where he was wont to tread, Unconscious man! as on the common weed, Deeming it had no Wonderproperties, And yet so deep, that e'en the subtle head Of high Philosophy, whose thought unties Nature's most secret web, may find its best supplies 10 Of unadulterated Lore in these Same simple forms of natural beauty, where High elements, like winds amid the trees, Lurk all unseen; and as the viewless air Kissing to mellow utterance, doth share With the windharp its fairyfancies sweet, So too our spirits commune with these fair And holy forms, 'till from its calm retreat The answering spirit wake, and Essence Essence greet. 11 High visitations are upon us here, E'en in this weekdaylife, and Wisdom may Be gathered on the roadside, everywhere; E'en from the trodden stone on which we lay Our heedless feet, like sparks her heavenly ray May be struck forth, by him who seeks aright, She dwells in all Life's forms: but books astray Have led our steps, we walk in a false Light, And by the midnightlamp we blear our genuine sight, 12 And in broadday we seek with taperglare, Smokedimm'd and flaring, for that holy Lore Which never grows but in the Sun and Air, Which like the wild fieldflowers, will no more Dwell in convention's Limits, than the hour Will bring back to the Fool his minutes flown; Thus like the Child upon the barren shore, We seek some painted bauble, while unknown Lies Life's vast Ocean and the Winds by which 'tis blown. 13 Wisdom grows everywhere, for all the same: Common as water, or th' allgrasping air, Free to the needs of all; an empty Name Monopolists may bid her products bear, But of the Thing itself, as ample share The poorest man is free to as the king; It is no hothouseplant: its fruits so fair Hang within reach of all, sureripening From day to day, as Truth a stronger beam doth fling; 14 And oft it grows too strongest in that soil Which man has least disturbed, wherein no seed Of Form and Custom has been sown, to spoil The racy natural qualities which feed With healthy Juice the lifesap: where no Weed Of thousandrooted Prejudice has grown; Aye it bears best 'mong those who have no need Of sects and systems, calling it their own, 'Mong those who by the heart still Wrong from Right have known. 15 This is true Wisdom; she takes no delight In names and Nomenclatures, forms and creeds, At best the husk, nor doth she hide her light In a Darklantern: such he only needs Who to selfpurpose, selfconfusion feeds Her holy lamp, that on his path its Ray Alone may fall, and show him where he treads While others grope; poor fool! he still must stray, Like arguments in vicious circles is his way, 16 Which straight confound themselves; for her divine And blessed light is catholic, it throws Its radiance on all things, nor will shine Shut up to selfish Ends: but straightway grows Into a dim, false flame, whose light allows No natural Object to retain its shape, But all Things to the sight distorted shows; Thus Cunning selfo'erreached, cannot escape From his selfwoven toils: thus man too, like the Ape 17 Or Fox, may plot within his narrow sphere To overreach his fellows, and may have The spider's manysidedness, but ne'er Catholic wisdom, which alone can save His frail lifebark from shipwreck; he may brave Man's cunning, countertrick and counterlie, And wile oppose to wile, for knave with knave Likeweaponed fights; but Time's his Enemy, Strongmemoried, quickfooted, and more sure of eye 18 Than is the windfleet greyhound in the chace Of the weak hare: all doublings are in vain, He never loses Sight, nor slacks his Pace. Kings are longhanded, thrice as long again Are Time's and thrice as sure: tho' he have lain In ambush 'till we nightforget he is, Like an armed man at length upon Truth's plain And cunningbaffling ground we see him rise, And Vengeance claims us, in a higher Name, as his! 19 Oh Cunning, when we look thee in the face Thou art wellfavoured as Truth's self might be, Save that thou want'st a something, a naive Grace, Such as in Childhood's artless face we see, A hallowing from within, a spirit free From guile, suspicion, fear, selfconfident; Her forms thou ap'st, but this is not in thee E'en to dissemble; when our glance is bent At aught beside thy front, thy dress is soiled and rent, 20 Beside, behind, and thro' the flimsy screen Thy distort Limbs, Abortion foul, we view; Thou hast quickmotioned sight, to see, unseen, Glanceshunning Eyes, a cheek that keeps its hue, Not the free dancing of the blood, which true And heartfelt feelings changefully propel O'er the frank brow, expression evernew, But guilefixt tints, and still thy tongue doth tell In lipdeep words some specious tale that sounds fullwell. 21 Thou art batsighted, for thou lov'st twilight, And where an honest man sees doubtfully Thou work'st secure: thou hast most minute sight And canst detect with much facility All things, howsmallsoe'er, that round thee lie; But like the firefly, thy feeble ray Lights a small space, and but discovers thy Poor Gropings in the Dark, and Truth's Broadday, When best the soundeyed see, from thee takessight away; 22 Prudence disdains thee, thou art but her ape, Thou dost but travesty her noble mien Undoing still thyself, the more her shape Thou fain wouldst imitate, for then is seen How great the difference that lies between Thy selfdetecting awkwardness, which wears Her attributes as beggars play the queen, And her own noble form, which on it bears The stamp of in born worth, approved by Change and Years, 23 Which strip thee in derision, and display Thy figure in Truth's glass to all men's eyes; Thy path is winding as the serpent's way, That bellycrawling beast, who to the skies Has never raised his head, but sees what lies In the vile dust beneath him, and no more, E'en such art thou: and Nature doth comprize Thee in the list of Beings whom her Power Creates, despisÃ«d tools, to work her mighty Lore. 24 In this vast Universe, this boundless Sphere, Where the snake's poison and the scoffer's tongue, In selfdespite, their testimony bear To that Allwisdom, unto Whom belong The powers that fix the bounds of Right and Wrong; Who says, Â«thus far, thus far alone, thy sway Shall reachÂ»: whose aweful voice unto the throng Of multitudinous waves was heard to say, Break up, ye everlasting Deeps, break up, the Day, 25 The Vengeanceday is come! and ye shall be My ministers of wrath: go forth, and sweep This sinpolluted Earth, that man may see The Lord of Hosts can bid the mighty deep Rise up and do his bidding: let him creep In the rockbosomed cave, or on the height Of the cloudcleaving hills selftrusting sleep; Go forth, and teach him that all strength is slight As the reedsshadow, save of Truth, 'gainst Heaven's might. 26 In this vast sphere, where discord is the seed Whence springs the perfect Growth of Unity, Where contradictions on each other feed, And thus incorporate, take forms that vie With rarest blessings: where Corruptions lie Foul and fermenting, till such Shapes arise As clothe our sweetest thoughts with Imagery, Making them no more dreams: the Rosebudsdies, The violet's, which open up like angelseyes; 27 And where the crimes and sufferings of years, By Wisdom's glorious Alchemy, are made To change their Nature: smiles transformed from tears, Defeat to Victory, from Martyrs laid Low by the axe or stake, and Crime's Parade Of fleeting triomph, Truths that spiritwise Rise from their dust, eternally to aid The cause they loved, with powers which Time denies To man, they live again, a life that never dies. 28 Here, Cunning, thou too like the serpent hast Thine own allotted part, tho' base and low, Yet all is Good, as he will own at last, Who by a wide survey has learnt to know The soul of Good which in ill things doth grow; A steady Counterprinciple which bends The stubborn neck of Ill, and makes it bow Unto the yoke; while Wisdom shapes her Ends, To these, by moral Gravitation, all life tends. 29 Referred unto this common centre, things, Which to the careless Eye bore visibly No mark of adaptation, like the springs Of a machine viewed disconnectedly, Gain power, strength, beauty, purpose, unity, Like the wheelspokes, when knit unto one end; And Wisdom with her calm, farreaching Eye, Looking before and after, can extend Her ken beyond this Earth, and see where all things tend. 30 Our Fathers in the good old days of yore Were as her fosterchildren, and this Isle Gave forth her wonders; such was he who bore The sword of Hampden, which high Thought the while Guided to holiest ends, where hollow guile And selfaggrandizement were not; such he, On whose high musings her approving Smile Fell ever: for what other could he be Than her own chosen one, to whom ungrudgingly 31 She gave the innerlight, when toil and care, Lifewasting thoughts, Ingratitude, and days Of evil suffered godlike, robbed his share Of earthly pleasures, dimming the frail rays Of this worn body's sight, which yearly lays Aside some Sense, some clayborn Faculty, While more and more the Soul doth inly blaze: 'Till for awhile the Body seems thereby Made incorruptible, transfigured visibly! 32 Thus as the claycoarse faculties gave way, Those of the innerman grew pure and strong, And wings erst wrapped within this sheath of clay Unfolded now, and on his ear the song Of angels, as to one who did belong To their own bands, came sweetly welcoming; Remembrance of all suffering and wrong Was as a Dream forgot, a most vain Thing, Like to a little Dust shook from an Eagle's wing! 33 Oh! happy Isle, Oh! heavenfavored Isle, Beyond all words! the Groves of Academe, (Where Plato's tongue could Wisdom's self beguile, Charming her from the Spheres to that sweet stream, Babbling its attic song as in a dream Of Fairyland), those groves have never seen, Tho' there the soul was as its own sunbeam, Spirits of more majestic make and mien, Than in this Isle as Prophets and as Seers have been; 34 Men to whom Visions as of old were given And Secondsight; like Moses, they stood on The mountaintop, and saw the dark veil riven From off the Future's features: men who won Truth's bloodless conquests, vaster far than sun E'er set on: men to whom high fancies were Familiar as household words, by none In any Land surpassed: Atlases to bear An Empire's Weight, firm Pillars of Truth's Temple fair! 35 And Saints and Martyrs were among them: Men Who sowed Faith with their Blood, to whom we owe A Blooddebt, and who will demand again A strict account of what we reap and sow, And of that blood which on our fields did flow A precious rain upon a precious seed, Which but for our slack Love were reaped ere now, A goldengrainÃ«d crop, on which might feed, As on the Heavenmanna, all whose souls have need, 36 For like the Manna, all who eat of it Would be newfilled with life: exhaustless store, Increasing with consumption; but we sit With folded hands, as tho' our task were o'er, As tho' within our souls no pledge we bore Of that which we should be; and yet we have Warnings and flashings forth of eldtime power, And Echoes greet us from beyond the grave; Up and be doing, if that Blessing ye would save, 37 Redeem the pledge! shall holy blood be spilt, Still speaking from the ground whereon we tread, And asking retribution on past guilt, A holy retribution? shall the dead Claim it, and vainly, from us who have read How in the olden day they shed their blood, Embraced the flames, and gave the axe their head, That we might be freemen: that from their mood Of godlike sufferance, might spring a deathless Good? 38 Oh how their lofty spirits must disdain Those whom they would have made the progeny Of their own souls: the heirs, not of their Pain And Martyrdom, but of a Liberty That costs us not the shadow of a sigh, Tooeasywon, and therefore passed away; For toil's the price of all that's Good and High, Not base handwork, but like that by which they Earned still,(the soul's high toil)Faith's Wages day by day: 39 Repining not, tho' still their harvesthome Seemed everdistant, for in God their trust Was placed, and well they knew a day would come, Tho' not for them, when that full harvest must Be reaped at last: tho' trod oft in the dust By swinish hoofs of that most bestial rout, Who would pollute God's altar with their lust; They knew fullwell that Truth's old battleshout From field to field would sound, nor in this Isle die out: 40 Nor erred they: for among us there are ears Which hear it ringing still amid our plains And on those haunted spots, which holy fears And hopes have hallowed, and subliming pains: A spirit which all meaner home disdains Than Nature's Universal Heart; there are Who answer that old voice when it complains Of pledges lost, and by their fathers swear That they relinquish not an heritage so fair. 41 And yet it is a sad, sad thought, to think That there are those among us who can tread O'er these timehallow'd scenes, and yet not shrink At their own baseness, standing on the dead, The Pander on the Saint's and Martyr's head, The Slave on the Freeman's; who breathe the air These godlike spirits breathed, their tales have read, And trod where they have trod, and yet can bear Their own selfconsciousness so near the Lion's Lair. 42 And e'en the blessed Field of Runnymede, Whose Flowers by Freedom's Breath are fanned, and where, As o'er the holy Ground in Awe we tread, Faint Echoes and high Accents on the Air From out those olden Days, an Import bear As of some mighty Presence floating by On viewless wing, and joyous Voices there Seem weaving choral Bursts for Conquest high, Alas! tho' holy Ground the Peasant knows not why, 43 But like Earth's common Dust he ploughs it o'er With brute unconscious Foot, when it should be, Like holy Shrine, sought out by Rich and Poor; By all who breathe the Breath of Liberty, By all who reap hereditarily, And who do not, the Harvests which that Day Sowed in the golden Furrows of this free And heavenfavored Isle, tho' now the Ray Which ripened those high Crops seems fading fast away! 44 Our Sidneys and our Miltons are no more: Our Saints and Martyrs scorn us in the Grave! Their Dust is worth our Souls! and that high Lore, Which in its own sole self has Power to save A Nation from Perdition, and to lave Its Spirit from corruption, that is gone: That precious Boon, by which the Land might have Regeneration, and which like God's own Pure, quickening Breath, maintains it sound alone! 45 That liferenewing charm, more potent far Than all Medea's Spells and Juggleries, Which holds dominion o'er a nation's star, And still can keep or hurl it from the skies; That charm, whose mighty power in virtue lies, In highsouled thoughts, and actions bodying these: This is the true Palladium, this the prize, The heavenfallen shield, which lost, the Peace, Power, Glory, Fame and Freedom of a nation cease! 46 We have no more that wisdom which could find E'en in defeat the Joys of victory: And something nobler in the inmost mind, The consciousness, (tho' Fortune should deny Success, and baffle us in mockery,) Of having still deserved it: this have we No longer, nor that holy fear to lie Unto our Being's End: the Pride to be Lords of our minds and acts, and in the dungeon free; 47 This was the life of soul, and they who breath'd Its atmosphere had neither wish nor need To feel their brows with fleeting laurels wreathed, Theirs was a higher Faith, a purer Creed, In Good and Ill, in word, and thought, and deed They followed it, and for its own sole sake, Not as we do for worldly wealth and greed; In their calm Wisdom they had power to take All sting from Pain and Death, and Joys unfound, to make; 48 Oh! Blessings on their soulsubliming Lore! Like to benificent Angels, I could bow To them, for what sin is it to adore Spirits who 'mid Life's manyfeatured Woe, Th' Immortal's Impress so, so clearly show, Composed for high Exploit, and with God's Seal And Superscription stamped upon their Brow, Men who still looking beyond Time, could heal By Thought all Ills, and in this Now the Future feel. 49 These were the Statesmen who from God's own Book, His own Churchgoverment and Polity, Their high Statewisdom drew: nor would they brook That public Faith should stoop to trick and lie, To compass in the Toils an Enemy; They loved Plaindealing, where Man's Nature is Ennobled, and o'erreached by Trickery Swerved not, preferring even thus to miss, Than otherwise to gain; nay, rightly deeming this 50 The only Gain, and cheaply purchased by All Sacrifice; for when a State is true To its own self: when for Humanity It suffers, and maintains, as it should do, Its plighted Faith inviolate, then too 'Tis mightiest! not thro' Sword and Spear, for this Is not Strength, but thro' Truth and Virtue, thro' The Power of Good, by which its mere Voice is Made mightier than armÃ«d Hosts, for it is His 51 Voice also, is the Voice of God, and as Such too the Nations hear it, and they bow Their Heads in Awe, as onward it doth pass, Like the Allmighty's Breath, now to lay low A Throne with its invisible, light Blow, And now to scatter Armaments: for 'tis God's Presence, and whereever it doth blow, 'Tis as if his own viewless Form o'er this Earth whispering passed! this knew they, and therefore to his 52 Will looked alone who reads the hearts of men, And who has set his law against a lie, As 'gainst a profane thing that breeds again Evil for evil; nor would they deny The truth, tho' it were one to speak and die: Such selfrespect, parent of lofty Deeds And noble thoughts, had they: their inner Eye Was faithclear and they loved the Truth which feeds That homedelight with which no other Joy man needs. 53 They had no selfo'erreaching sophistries, No cunning, dark Statemaxim's where the head Plays with the heart, as 'twere, a game at Dice, Cheating true feeling, 'till all sense be dead Of Right and Wrong, save as of things that lead Unto a given End, indifferent In their ownselves, valued as they succeed: Now this, now that, to all occasions bent, Masks which but serve to dupe, and hide a base Intent. 54 They dealt not in that vain Lipeloquence Which throws the dazzling Hues of Sophistry Over the Cause of Crime and Impotence, Which with a Cloud of Words would wrap the Lie It dares not, tho' brassfaced, speak openly, Lest Commonsense should lift her Voice and smite The shameless Liar in his Panoply Of guileforged Armour, which a Maid's frail Might Could shiver with one Stroke of Truth and put to flight. 55 To these Things they stooped not; they would not bow Their proud and lofty Natures to such base Selfdegradation: they scorned, not to show What really were their Thoughts, and left the Race Its fleeting Shame or Glory to his Grace, Without whose knowledge not a sparrow dies, Faithfully waiting his good Time and Place. They gave what Justice asks, and what denies, Alike to Weak and Strong, to Friends or Enemies! 56 No matter who the claimant, even tho' A Child; enough if what was asked were right And just: they bowed before it as unto A Revelation of an higher might Than that of Man, which laid on them its light Yet irresistible Constraint: they bent In sublime meekness, from the dazzling Height Of human Grandeur, to the least Voice sent Up to them, as to that of the Omnipotent! 57 Oh that the present Day could show such Men As these high souls, then might we hope to see The Glories and the Deeds revive again Which live but in dead Books: but what are we? Whence draw we our Mind's Food? we are not free, Tho' the Word's ever on our Lips, and there The frequent Lie should as a Blister be; We are a moneyslaving Race, and bear E'en in our souls the Traces of the Chains we wear! 58 They called Things by their Names: they rent intwain The Web of Prejudice and Error wound 'Round Words and timefix'd Customs: turn'd again To Nature, by her holy Guidance found The Truths they sought, and with those bright Gems crown'd The Brow of heavenborn Philosophy, Like Nature simple and like her profound. But we, we turn the Truth into a Lie, Good, Ill: Ill, Good we call, 'till all Distinctions die! 59 A base Wordtyranny enthralls our Minds; A Cry got up by some Mobleader flies From Lip to Lip, and Assesears it finds Capacious and alert: its Task it plies, With Steamrapidity it hatches Lies; A little Leaven, as the Scripture says, Will leaven the whole Lump: thus the few Wise, Who do not fool it in the common Maze, Are left, a Laughingstock, to hope for better Days. 60 Oh! Freedom oft must for her Children weep, When thus a little Dust thrown in their Eyes Can blind them: while her misnamed Patriots sleep, Or calmly from the Wreck of Liberties Await to see a nobler Fabric rise, As chance may patch the Fragments up again; While Mountebanks and Stateapothecaries With Poisondrugs would make the Nation sane, And by its madness work when Reason were in vain. 61 A Nation's Vices work its Ruin: they Are still the Soil where Seeds of Misery Are sown by Fate; Crime is of sure Decay The parent â if ye make a Mockery Of holy Things, turn Truth into a Lie, She who is so benificent and mild When loved, is an avenging Deity If injured, and on those who have defiled Her Shrines and Oracles, her Vengeance high is piled! 62 She will forsake ye, leave ye to the Powers Of Darkness: yea! your Light shall Darkness be, And it shall lead ye on from bad to worse; Evil for Good shall ye make choice of, see In your perdition, your security; And when the Light shines, ye shall turn aside And know it not: in name shall ye be free, That specious semblances may flatter Pride, While the real Sore unheeded spreads corruption wide 63 Thro' the state's every member, 'till Decay Vast, premature, its strength shall paralyze, And Crime and Guilt with Ironrod shall sway A selfdegraded race, 'till there arise Wisdom from suffering, and Mercy cries To Vengeance Â«holdÂ»: but bitter woes must first O'erbrim the cup, e'er Truth can ope the Eyes Of men in Sin and Degradation nurst, For he who would be free, himself the chains must burst! 64 First ye shall see in God's own holy shrine The moneychangers haggle for their price, Bartering for earthly things, the things Divine; Religion, a Statetool, no more supplies The Laws deficiencies, nor vivifies Them into Instruments of Truth and Good; They shall be empty Forms and Ceremonies, Not loved, but feared: shedders of guiltless blood, By Selfabuse creating their own hateful food. 65 Then Goverment and Church shall fornicate: Then shall be lent the cloak of sanctity To deeds of darkness, and unchristian hate And partyzeal, and squinteyed Bigotry Shall make the Gospeltruths a mystery; And as a most fit and sweet Sacrifice, Bloodofferings, in the name of the Most High, Pollute his altars; and with sophistries Shall men cheat conscience: 'till they credit their own lies! 66 'Till daily using them, they know them not As such: so changed their Nature too thereby, Sin grows their Element, and, wretched Lot! Falsehood their truth! their Lives shall be a Lie, A vicious Circle, where eternally They are condemned upon their own Steps to Return, for like the Mole, when they draw nigh The Light, they turn away: the Grand and True They cannot comprehend, else they would be so too! 67 Then shall the statesman from his oily Tongue Troll gliblysounding Names, but meaning nought: Of Freedom, Justice, Truth, discoursing long; Meanwhile the Victim's to the Shambles brought, And the duped Nations, when too late, are taught What this Statelanguage means; mere Lures and Baits To fill the Ear, 'till they be sold and bought. Thus Vice for his own Back the Scourge creates, And the Slave bears the Yoke he dares not break, yet hates! 68 Thus the brute Idol unto which ye bow Is but a Moloch, yet fit god for ye Who oftdeluded, have not learnt to know This vile Strawsubstitute from Liberty: Could Hampden's Spirit rise, could Milton see The Place of Her who by his Lips once spake, Filled by this Idol, sad his Soul would be; Thick Darkness once more on his Eyes would take Her wellcome Seat, and forth the Prophet's Wrath would break. 69 Oh that the Virtues of the Days of Yore Might yet revive among us, that we were Not selfish Men: cold Hearts that feel no more Than the brute Stones: aye, verily I fear The stones would sooner stir themselves to hear The touching Notes of an Orphean Lyre, Than these men's Hearts, so little do they bear Of holy Feeling or of high Desire; The Altar itself keeps no spark of heavenly Fire! 70 Oh for the homely Tastes that found a feast In Nature's least display: oh for the Love That sought a heart alone, and found sweet Rest Where she is wont to dwell, with Peace, above The vain soulfretting turmoils which but move The wise mind to contempt; oh for the days, When Wisdom meekly could herself approve Unto men's hearts, and led them in her ways, Her Ways of Innocence, where like a child she plays! 71 But we have other tastes, we read strange things Where Truth is not, true feeling allbelied; We weep o'er braincoined Woes, the sufferings Of sinners, whose cold hearts are shut by Pride 'Gainst man and maker, and who strive to hide And quench in scorn the inwardburning Flame; Monstrous creations whence we turn aside In shame and loathing that a common name Should blend us with them or but make us seem the same. 72 Corsairs and Giaours, and a motley crew More hideous than Chimera famed of yore, Fireeating bravoes, whom sound minds eschew, The Essence of Vulgarity, and more Disgusting than the coarsestminded boor With all their mockrefinement: for at least He's true to Nature, and she still has Power E'en in her rudest Workmanship to test The utmost skill of man, and put to shame his best. 73 And for such foul abortions, that almost Make our hair stand on End, a simple song For a few natural hearts, is scornful tost Aside and trampled by the bateyed throng; Tho' unto it such melodies belong As might create a soul, and bid it beat Once more in breasts where it has lain so long Like a dead Thing, devoid of all lifeheat, And swaying but forced thoughts, like tyrant on his seat. 74 What is the End of Art? to multiply The modes of moral being, to create Models of all of Beautiful and High In thought and deed: that thus our earthly state May have bright visitations, and dilate Beyond the narrow stature of Earth's fears, Its Cares and Sorrows, whose stillgrowing Weight Weighs on the Soul, 'till gathering with Years The Rust and Soil of Earth its Glory disappears. 75 This is Art's holy End; a Denizen Of Hesvensspheres, she deigns to dwell below To glad the eyes and cheer the hearts of men! To her own sublime chisel do we owe Those antique statues, viewing whieh we grow Into souloneness with the Life of things, Feeling a beauty Nature's forms ne'er know; To her we owe the Attic Muse, who sings Her antique melodies, sweet as the woodlandspring's; 76 'Twas She, who on the heavenwingÃ«d Steed, SongfablÃ«d Pegasus, (as told of yore, In numbers far too sweet one Doubt to breed,) Alighting on that museloved Hill, which o'er The Delphic Shrine looks down towards Crissa's Shore, As tho' Fame's Path lay thro' Religion s Fane, 'Twas she who bade his Spellhoof strike the Floor Of the hard Rock, then ne'er to sleep again, Gushed the clear Stream which long in Nature's Breast had lain! 77 The poetrill! the Steedsfount is its name, And on a Grecian Lip 'twas Hippocrene; And all who drank thereof were dear to Fame, And aye will be; tho' ages intervene 'Twixt us and them, their Laurels still are green With an immortal Growth, for Nature gave The Lifesap to them and they keep their sheen; They drank not of the muddy streams that lave Falsehood's cold lips, stillflowing with Lethean Wave 78 'Twas Art who gave to Raphael the hues Of Heaven's own rainbow, that with them he might Clothe divine thoughts, and at his pleasure use Those subtlest of all Elements, shade, light And color, fixing them before the sight Of envying Nature, in unfading grace, 'Twas she who led the mighty Shakespeare right, To hold the glass to Nature, and to place Beyond Time's reach a world, yet still in Time and Space. 79 Alas! the Art I speak of, that has fled, A catholic Wisdom ruling o'er the scene Of the mind's Efforts: no vain code of dead And empty forms, still making what has been Measure of that to be, the bodyseen And known of what the soul alone can see And know by Intuition; not that mean And worthless code of technicality, Which bids us ellwandmeasure even Fancy's Eye. 80 The Art I mean is but another name For Nature's self: a high and holy Lore Deduced from her eternal laws, the same Which guide the framing of the meanest flower, And the most vast creations of her power; Drawing as easily within their sphere The highest as the least; this Art before All Forms and Rules exists, 'tis Nature's clear, Selfharmonizing sway, that tunes heart, eye, and ear 81 To Beauty still, but they who seek a mean To better Nature, which she not supplies, Do e'en as he who to the sun's bright sheen Would hold a taper; her affinities Are not for fools: yet at the surface lies The mighty Truth, which we must learn to see, Fresh as the dew, with our own natural Eyes, Not thro' Convention's glass, which twists her free And healthy beautyshapes in apelike mockery. 82 This Art, twinborn with Nature, is eterne And changes not, like man's vain rules, built on Falsehood and Prejudice, where we discern How weak he is when he would walk alone; How sandbas'd all that the poor Worm has done, If on Truth's broad foundations it rests not; When Nature will not class it with her own Eternal works, she sweeps it from the spot As she would rase a moleheap: such still be their lot! 83 Whereas that which is True, endures for aye, For being fashioned forth conformably With her own Laws, these keep it from Decay: But that which is abortive still must die; For since it is a mere Anomaly And an Exception, it runs counter to The course of Things; while the least Flower by Her still is furnished with its Drop of Dew And each Spring reappears, for to her Laws 'tis 'true! 84 How much more should the Works then of man's mind To last enduringly, be likewise so! Great Poets are a Product of their Kind, The Hearts and Minds of many thousands go To make up one: and hence his Voice is no Mere passing Sound or idle Echo: 'tis The breath divine which quickens all below, All that is godlike in Man's Nature: this Sublimed in him appears, at once their Work and his! 85 He is the Firstborn of his Age, its strong Capacious Womb produces him, and by This mighty Parent's Fostering his Song Is strangely influenced; but all Things high Become the Poet of Humanity, Faith, Love, and Hope. What all believe, that is His Faith: what all feel, that he lastingly Embodies, lasts himself thro 'it, for this Is true and comes of God, thus God's Voice speaks by his! 86 No Sceptic can act grandly, neither write A Work that shall endure: his Efforts grow From Principles, which he adopts in spite Of Fact and Sense: they have no hold on, no Command o'er Man's best Feelings, neither owe Their Origin to any primary Grand Impulse of his Nature, whence still flow Love, Faith, Enthusiasm, Poetry; Like a dead Branch to which the Roots no Sap supply! 87 This Art is catholic, as wide her Sphere As Nature, and he who most loves the one, Will know the other best, for they do bear A close Relationship: Art is there none Save in adapting Nature; he alone Who thro 'her Isisveil has pierced: who by Her mighty Heart the Beatings of his own Accords: her Laws applies too, in the high Creative Spirit which pervades their ministry, 88 Not after the dead Letter, which can bear One Sense alone; who with discursive sight, From their true centre, views her works: and there With magisterial mind and hush'd delight, Admitted to the wondrous scene, aright Interprets all her laws: anomalies Can reconcile, and throw o'er all new Light, Not by the Letter which dead, changeless lies, But by the soul, which still its Proteusfunctions plies. 89 He, he alone, has earned that lofty name, Highpriest of Art, to whom his Calling is A Worship, a Religion: he her flame, Her altarflame may tend, nor can he miss Of her high revelations: it is his, While others but the Ethnic Forecourt tread, E'en at the inmost shrine to stand, and kiss The hem of Nature's garment, and to read Her oracles, from her own Lips receive his Creed! 90 He is the Prophet of the inmost Heart, Its Oracles are his â all high Truths flow From that one Fount, which o'er each barren Part Of mazy Life their quickening Waters throw: For ever does the Mind's Eye clearer grow When it sees by the Heart: the meagre Brain Its Seed in an ungrateful Soil doth sow, Devoid of Centralwarmth, and reaps not Grain, But Metaphysic's Tares, of all good Land the Bane! 91 Such was our Shakespeare, when his glorious eye Called from the Void the shapes of things unknown, Whose mind was as a mould, where Phantasy Cast her own fairybeings: he alone, If Nature failed (and she herself will own The truth, for him a secondself she made, And sanctioned to create: her chosen one) Might take her place: for Time to Nature said, Thy forms I change, but thou in him hast triomphÃ«d! 92 Mighty Artificer! to whom her laws And constitution she resign'd: whose eye, In its calm Wisdom, looked thro' all that was And may be in man's changeful Destiny, Teaching us that all here is vanity: He stood, selffreed from idle forms and rules, In her own vast, wide LaborÃ tory, And with a masterhand he grasped her tools, Creating at his Will, kings, madmen, heroes, fools. 93 How like a Providence he watches o'er The beings of his Phantasy: they play Their parts: are killed or die, and heard no more, Gone to their last account: they never lay Aside their human frailties, or betray The Mean that makes them, that high Art which still Does but interpret Nature: grave or gay, They laugh and weep like men, they love, hate, kill. Impartial he looks on, and leaves them their Freewill! 94 No mouthing, wiremoving Puppets, made To speak Setspeeches, whose Morality Is but the Drivel of some maudlin Head: But Heart upon their Lips, Fire in their Eye, Like Men they err, like Men they live and die, Still mixed of Good and Ill, as all Men are, And bound by Fellowcreaturesympathy Unto our Hopes and Fears, still do we share Their Joys and Griefs, for like in our own Breasts we bear. 95 We must not quarrel with them if at Times They talk not overgodly: if they be Not Saints with Â«Yea and NayÂ»: for Sins and Crimes Find natural Language in Impiety And scurrilous Licence: Life is a strange Medley Of Good and Ill: and men must act and speak As Chance or Education moulds them â the Least has his Mission to fulfill: Strong, Weak, Knave, Coward, Noble, Base, each plays his Part: they seek 96 According to their Lights, a Seeminggood Or a substantial: but to sacrifice Nature and Truth to what false Crities would Lay down as fit and proper, with their nice Fastidious Rules is Folly: ye have Eyes, Look forth into the Streets, and learn what are Life's actual Beings: Shakespeare was too wise To better Nature's Work, or with a Pair Of fine courtscissors cut vain Figures out of air. 97 He does not stretch or lop man's natural Shape And just Dimensions, thus to fit him to Some Theory: his Beings do not ape Each other: each unto himself is true, Each reasons as he has been led to do By the Events of his own Life: each is Strong in his own Identity, and thro' The Play the same: one wishes that, one this, One cracks his Joke, one seeks Fame's Garland or Love's Kiss! 98 He trusts to Nature's workings, to Man's Heart, To human Feeling, human Sympathy: And Nature is so strong, she can impart Interest to Beggar's Rags and Misery, To all where beats a Heart, to all Pride's Eye Would turn in Scorn from; Critics would in vain Force Art's Straightwaistcoat on Humanity, Still Nature sways the Breast, still Joy and Pain Make the Heart beat, and we grow Flesh and Blood again! 99 Beggars in Rags and kings in their proud Robes Are still the same poor forkÃ«d Things, the same Frail dustborn Worms: and Sorrow's Lancet probes Their Hearts alike â stand in the Pit and frame Your Criticcode: what Nature's Instincts blame Or praise, that write thou down as false or true: As the Face kindles, or grows dull and tame, Make thine own Comment: this Art Shakespeare knew. For not from dusty Books, from Nature's Stores he drew! 100 He was no closetbred Philosopher, Full of fine Thoughts, which never could be thought By those who're made to mouthe them: in the Stir Of manyfeatured Life his Lore he sought, Man, suffering, acting in its thronged Resort, In the Highways and Byways, his keen Eye Had read: yet if a noble Being, fraught With Heaven's best Gifts, called for his Pencil, by Its Magictouch she rose, all Ideality, 101 Like some pure Vision, 'mid the Noise and Strife Of the rude Fo ms around her: thus did he With practicalest knowledge of Man's Life, And the most keen, worldwise Sagacity, That probes each Sore, each coarse Deformity Of moral Being, blend with this the true Unsullied Spirit of Humanity: Mighty Philosopher! too well he knew That Life is doublefaced, and changes still its Hue! 102 He was not one of those dull, narrow Minds Who trace the Surfaceill, yet will not see The Good below: which Wisdom ever finds When at the Heart she looks impartially: The worst is not allevil, even he Has some good Germs, tho' checked by Want and Shame, Tho' showy Virtues oft pretended be And bring Discredit upon her high Name, Yet is there genuine Worth, least known to loudtongued Fame! 103 Cordelia! Miranda! Names of Love! Ye live to withess whence his Spirit drew Its Inspiration: ye alone might prove How well he Man's diviner Nature knew: Types of a Beauty are ye, calm and true, Which hallows, halolike, your maidenbrows, 'Till they seem as the Angels: oft to you From Earth's Bruteforms I turn and find Repose, Gazing on those calm Fronts, where no false Feeling throws 104 Its Fever and its Fretfullness: so clear Those ample Forehead's Stretch, and so serenc, That all we know of Grief and Heartbreak here Shows like a Dream, a something that has been, But is no more remembered, felt or seen! How beautiful seems Womanhood in thee, Cordelia? cut off in the first green Leaf of Existence: who could ever see Thee in that oldman's Arms, nor weep almost as he? 105 For thy Death seems a common Blow, and is As we ourselves had lost that which we have Of dearest, something which the Earth must miss And be the poorer for: we almost crave The Poet to reverse thy Fate, and save. But he, he knew too well his sublime Art, Nor longer claimed for Earth what Heaven gave, He knew it could not recompense that Heart, And therefore let the Godlike to its God depart! 106 How comprehensive was his Range! behold The Stage: how full! what rich Variety! What Movement in the Figures, young and old: New still succeeding, inexhaustibly, And Forms that gleam like Angels passing by! But we, we have profaned these Shapes of Grace, These perfect Statues fixed eternally On Nature's Pedestal, and by them place Distorted Figures which scarce own a human Face! 107 Mechanic Art's Abortions, Monstershapes That have no Likeness on the Earth, but take Such Nightmareforms, that viewed by these the Ape's Is bearabler: for Nature tho' she make Creatures uncouth or ugly, Toad or Snake, They're perfect in their kind, each in its Place Is good: but we, Idolaters, we break The antique Statues full of Life and Grace, With Egypt's Mummies Art's high Temple to deface. 108 Alas for Art â it is an empty Word Bandied from Lip to Lip and meaning naught: Still where no Substance is, the Name's most heard. By Quacks and Mountebanks its Laws are taught, Its End expounded, and a Shortcut sought, That fashionable Votaries may save Their Brains all Trouble: nay, it may be bought By Ounce and Pound, that thus each Fool may have His Pocketrules of Art, and play the Critic grave. 109 Art, high, creative Art, who only is Lawgiver, has become a mere Cantphrase: A Set of formal Rules applied amiss: A mere Ellwand to measure Bust and Face, Proportions, Forms of that ideal Grace, Which e'en the Soul can scarce grasp in its high And heavenly Inspiration, nor can trace Save with Imagination's glowing Eye: Instead of which these Men a Microscope apply! 110 She has become a Drawingroomfinelady, Too eyechaste and earnice tÃ³ dare to look Upon a naked Statue, and tho' ready To prostitute her Heart, will nowise brook A bold Expression, or a Â«naughty BookÂ», 'Tis so improper, and, what's worse by far, So vulgar, it would give her Nerves a Shock: With Shakespeare she maintains a knifepointwar, Castrate Editions only such chaste People dare 111 To set their Eyes on â Nature's Language sounds Too rude for their nice Ears: in Terms precise And Satinphrases, she her Thought propounds, And she will show the Door too in a Trice, Should you, poor Nature's Child, offend her niee Fastidious Standard of Propriety: Light Writings now alone are worth their Price, While the high Themes of Faith, Truth, Liberty, All that speaks to the Soul, are thrown contemptuous by! 112 But Art loves the free Air: she has no Fear To soil her Garments: in the Marketplace, Nay, in the Brothel itself, everywhere, Unsoiled herself 'mid all that's soiled and base, She studies Humannature, dares to trace The Passions as they living rise to view, Displayed in Act and working in the Face, Hence for her Pallet she selects each Hue, And having felt and seen, to Life she pictures true. 113 She has no prurient Passions, weak Desires That Flesh is Heir to: therefore dangerfree She treads the Haunts of Sin, secure respires Its sickly Breath â Hermaphrodite is she, Both Sexes in her Nature joinÃ«d be, Thus independent on brute Agencies, She on herself begets her Progeny: She lends no Ear unto the passing Cries Of Party, Place, or Passion: to all Centuries 114 Her calm, strong Voice is sent, appealing to Eternal Interests and Sympathies, For she is of all Time! she seeks the True, Revealing it, like Time, to Man's dim Eyes, Careless whom she offends, or whom defies: Man's higher Nature she addresses, as Having Soul as well as Body: Destinies Where Party, Sex, Age, Birth like Shadows pass, For universal Humannature is her Glass! 115 She bends not to the Forms and Usages Of Fashion, changing with each changing year, True unto Nature (this her chief Praise is) Her Archetype! sublimely chaste like her Tho' naked down unto the Feet! Eye, Ear So grandly blind and deaf to aught obscene: Chaste as the Venus The medicean Venus.in her Atmosphere Of calm ideal Beauty, which has been So long by Time thrown round her, as to screen 116 Her nakedness, from all save Lust's coarse Eye, With a far, far sublimer Veil than e'er Of Woof was made, the Veil of Modesty! And which tho' viewless, hides not less what ne'er Can or should to the godlike Sight appear; How little serves the spiritual Eye! That very Nakedness which first Lust's Leer Attracts, to it is but the Garment by Which Chastity conceals herself more per fectly! 117 How godlike 'tis in this fair World to see The Good and Godlike only, 'till we grow By thinking of naught else, ourselves to be So likewise; 'till all that is mean and low Lost to our sublime Sight, for us has no Existence any longer; for what to Our Mind is not kept present, is as tho' It were quite, quite destroyed; this is the true, The godlike Way to root out ill, and none to do! 118 Unto the Spirit spiritual Things Suffice; its Chastity by an Idea Is guarded more than by all Coverings, And 'till this be removed there is no Fear! Yea! ye may strip the Maiden naked, tear The veil from her chaste Brow, and yet shall she To her own and each pure Eye clothed appear, With that imperishable Robe which the Eternal himself wove from his own Modesty! 119 But that which is impure no Covering From Lust can hide, thro' all it will appear; For as e'en Nakedness a veil can fling O'er itself to pure Eyes, so too whate'er Unclean is veiled, Vice unveils! let Prudes sneer, The Fault is in the Eye that sees alone; E'en God's Word to the carnal mind's not clear From foul Suggestion; but this Art is gone, And a bedizened Harlot in her Stead is shown! 120 My God! and are we sunk to this? must Art. This high Art, which so grandly wrought of Yore The godlike from and for the Soul, depart And leave us a mere Name? shall she who bore Miltons and Shakespeares, nought of Godlike more Conceive in her vast Womb? must she give way Whose Voice can scatter armies, see her Lore Thus trampled in the Dust, her heavenly Sway Displaced, her Altars desecrate to God's of Clay? 121 Forbid it Heaven! let her Spirit rise And with a Milton's Tongue launch forth her Ire At such Pollution; shall her Victories O'er her brute Foes, her Efforts to inspire The Love of high Things, shall her Delphic Lyre Spanned by Apollo's Fingers and the Nine, And our bold Islandharp, with all the higher And nobler Impulses, leave nought divine, No Worth to Fireside, no Altar to the Shrine? 122 Alas! Pen, Pencil, Chisel labour now For Hire, or the mere Moment's Fame; no more Does Genius, kneeling by the Altar, vow To it that during Worship, which before Made Art Religion! No, the Days are o'er When with her Fairywand she could array Angels in mortal Weeds: the Forms of yore Which Poets moulded from Earth's common Clay, Yet filled with the Lifebreath the true Promethean Ray! 123 Human like our ownselves, still Flesh and Blood, Subject to Chance and Change, to Wrongs and Woes, And Fortune's Buffets: fed with the same Food, And breathing one same Atmosphere with those Whose dull Eye sees the Beautiful, yet knows Not in it that high Power which can draw, (As Nature from the Dust the Fairyrose) From earthly Yearnings and from Life's vain War Of jarring Elements, Forms free from Soil or Flaw! 124 Spirits of Beauty! ye who in the Strife And Turmoil of this Being shine with Ray So calm and clear, like Stars, o'er Man's dim Life, Look from your Pedestals, beneath which play Time's troubled Waves, while Ages swept away And Generations on their vain Career, Attest your timedefying Beauty: say Whence comes the Charm which grows not dull or sere. What high Art framed ye? speak, your calm Lips let me hear. 125 Antigone, dear Attic Name! sweet Spell! Calling Love's holiest Scene to my Mindseye, The Muse's favorite Scene, the Grove where dwell Th'Avengers, and that blind old Man hardby, After Life's many Woes now drawing nigh The Haven of his Rest: held up by thee, Divinest Maid! whose holy Ministry Thus far has led his Steps, so calm and free In thy young Wisdom, and so full of Piety! 126 Selfsacrificing Spirit! of whose Arm The griefbent Edipus had made so long His living Staff, how holy is the Charm Breathed by thy Fortunes and the Poetssong Upon thy very Name! poor Child of Wrong, Whom Duty called upon to sacrifice That Happiness which seems still to belong By Right to her Disciples, but most wise, Thou gav'st up Earth's brief Joys to taste those of the skies! 127 Hector, Andromache! ye pure Twinbeams From one same Source of Beauty, and ye few Ethereal Forms that realize the Dreams Of our young Poethearts, for loving you We cannot stoop again to Earth to woo The common Forms of coarse Mortality; Imogen! Desdemona! and thou too, Divine Clarissa! Types wherein doth lie The Essence of all Love, Truth, Beanty, Poesy! 128 Clarissa! thou, thou art my Spirit's Bride: I never saw thee, yet I love thee more Than aught on Earth â and didst thou walk beside Life's coarse, prosaic Forms: like them, tread o'er Its hackneyed Dust? yes! and for this before Thee do I bow and worship, for thou art No idle Dream, but something which once wore Our Flesh and Blood, and by the beating Heart, Spite of its Frailties, still fulfill'dst thy godlike Part! 129 No bright Impossibility, which we Stare at awhile, and straight forget, as tho' It ne'er had been â fullseldom may we see Aught like thee on this Earth, yet art thou no Impossibility; 'twas in Life's low, Prosaic, coarse Realities, nay, by What harshest is therein, that thou didst grow Most godlike! tis this Triomph calm and high, Which links thee still with Earth, yet lifts thee to the Sky! 130 Then speak, ye Spirits, those calm Lips unseal Whose deep, clear Wisdom can alone lay bare The mistery of your Making, and reveal The Soul of Art, whose Power extends so far: That true creative Art, whereof ye are Such noble Symbols: of that Art which is Nature's own Laws, creating Shapes more rare, Wherein the Possible the Real doth kiss, Nature's Jointwork with Man nor wholly hers nor his. 131 She gives the Stuff, he the enduring Form Which from his Spiritsdepths the Secondsight Must body forth: lovely as from the Storm The Rainbow starts, so untouched by the Blight And Fever of Man's Life, pure Shapes of Light. Nay e'en the earthborn Matter, soulsubdued, By high Participation of its Might, Loses its Earthliness, and as endued With spiritual Life, withstands Time's changeful mood. 132 Art's only Source is in Man's immost Soul, And what is there to him by it made known Is as a Revelation of this Whole, Thro' Man, of its own Being, of its own Internal Principles, thro' which alone, And in Conformity with which aught true Or grand can be wrought out: his Voice is one With Nature's then, and what she utters thro' His one Heart and believes therein, mankind feels too! 133 Art's source in outward things must hot be sought: Who seeks the sunlight's source amid the rays Scattered o'er earth: tho' each and all be fraught With the celestial Radiance which plays Around the firemanÃ«d steeds, when Day's Eyedazzling car is whirled along the sky; 'Tis in external things that Art displays Her beautygiving power, which else lie Dead, senseless, meaningless, no types to heart or eye. 134 This vast and glorious Universe, this World Of evervarying Loveliness: this sky Wherein the clouds, like some bright Map unfurl'd Of unknown lands, show to the outer eye Shapes rarer than all dreams of Phantasy: Seas, woods, earth, heaven, all things to be or been, All are but types of one sole majesty, Of one sole Truth and Beauty, felt unseen, The thousandpulsing Heart of Nature's endless Scene! 135 Its Symbol this wide Universe, which Art Interprets and divines: its Mysteries And oracles declares, and with each Part Quicksympathizing, reads it as it lies A Character in Nature's Harmonies: A Link, which if removed, tho' small, would break The vast Chain of her Continuities; From this Eternal Beauty Art must take Her Laws, and by the same her own Creations make. 136 He who by Intuition lead aright, Selftasking zeal, and study of all Things Wherein this Beauty is revealed to sight, And as it gushes in his soul, and flings Thence its Elysiandrops, like some fresh spring's, Making Eterne all that it falls upon, He who has toiled in Love, and with him brings A sinpure heart, Wisdom by meekness won, A sympathy for all that moves beneath the sun, 137 He, he shall comprehend the true Idea Of this vast Universe, and like a ray Blend indivisibly with it; his clear Capacious ken shall seize the one sure way, While Form and Custom lead the re t astray, And in that high Idea his soul shall live, (E'en as his body in the Light of day) Having its being there, and thence derive Its Knowledge, Freedom, Bliss, nor vainly fretting, strive 138 After some baseless form of seeming Good; From the true sightpoint the Reality Of things he judges, and in lofty mood Looks down on this brief Scene, the Vanity, The Noise and Fret which at its surface lie, So unintelligible save to the man Whose calm, clear glance looks deeper than the eye Into the heart of things, and loves to scan The true selfharmonizing soul of life's vast plan. 139 He knows what Art is: he can fitly frame Its laws for noble ends, and bid it be Worthy of that high source from whence it came, An Emanation of the Deity: His Representative, by whose voice He From age to age holds commune with mankind; One Essence, the selfsame unchangingly, But varying still its forms to suit the mind Of nations as they leave their cast off sloughs behind. 140 As he administers its laws, with hand Creative moulds the matter Time supplies, As at the stroke of some Enchanter's Wand Forms of eternal Loveliness arise: Statues, that from their Pedestals, with Eyes Full of a holy Lore, look calmly down, Like Gods who draw the breath of purer skies, While Time's vain passing clouds are idly blown Beneath their feet: still in their majesty, alone 141 And unapproachable, they stand for aye; And as we gaze upon them, we awake From the dull lethargy wherein we lay As in a deathsleep, since the drowsy Lake, Of whose Lethean Wave each soul must take A deep draught at its birth, had washed away All forelife memories: since mortal ache, And sense's thralldom, dimming the bright ray Of eldtime Glories on the soul had laid their sway. 142 Thus gazing we awake: and as upon The mind that long hath stray'd, recalled by things Of antique Token, thronging one by one, Past memories come floating on the Wings Of days long flown; so from these Objects springs Up in our souls the fountain of belief; And from the Past a bygone Glory flings Its Reflexlight upon us, and tho' brief At first, it gathers strength, 'till thro' all clouds of Grief 143 And Earthliness that compass us around, Its undimmed radiance falls upon our Eyes Once more unfilmed; then Earth gives forth a sound Of gratulation, and the Heart which lies In Universal Nature's breast replies In Joy to ours: for we once more have won Part of that heritage which Life denies To disinherited man, we have begun Again the life of Soul, ere this vain scene be done. 144 Then is no longer death, nor doubt, nor fear, Nor vain tears shed o'er fond ones torn away, Nor Grief for passing losses: all things here Are looked on with such feelings as he may Experience, who knows that every day Brings his bark nearer home: and the dread bier Is but the quiet cradle where we lay Our limbs at rest and gently disappear, Not dieing but transform'd, and as we wake, we hear 145 Glad Welcomings, and wellknown Voices make Sweet music as of yore; the wise, who have By contemplation kept the soul awake And passed in thought the portals of the grave, May tread all fears beneath their feet and brave All Phantoms of vain Terror which below Scare the weak minds that have no Refuge save In Things as vain as are their Fears: who know Not that the Soul alone makes all Man's Weal or Woe 146 And Art, who realizes the Ideal, Creates new Worlds for her true Votaries, More ample and serene, to which they steal, (When heavy on their souls life's burthen lies,) To see the sights, and breathe of purer skies The calm, clear atmosphere, and list at times, Struck from her holy Shell, the melodies Of heaven's own Muse, such as in antique climes From Sinai and Horeb sent its mystic chimes 147 Echoing thro' boundless space: whereof e'en now Sweet snatches linger on the vocal air Above the martyr's grave, and o'er the brow Of the gray timeworn battlements, which bear The print of Freedom's step, and everywhere Where holy things have sunk again to Earth, Leaving around the spot a haunting fear, A hallowing dread, a consciousness of worth, That sheds o'er common Ground the Glory of its birth. 148 'Tis Art that strives poetic Form to give Unto the Real, 'till all we hear and see Becomes suggestive of that higher life For which we yearn, 'till that by constantly Gazing upon the Beautyhallowed, we Ourselves grow beautiful: for who can know The Perfect and the Beautiful, and be Himself deformed, imperfect? even so From our own hearts, the perfect Beauty still must grow. 149 All that there is of Beauty, Glory, Power, In this wide Universe, all that the Ear (In the full consciousness of its high dower) Of many voicÃ«d harmonies can hear: All that the glorious faculty of clear And unperverted vision can display When with creative glance it sheds, as 'twere, On Earth's unquickened forms the pure liferay, All, all are dead to him, whose steps have gone astray. 150 He who to Form and Custom slaves his Eye, For him the Beautiful is not, he knows, He comprehends it not; its mystery Is only for the mind whose compass grows By contemplating that to which it owes Its Qrigin, until like that it be; 'Till thro' all forms on which that Beauty throws Its varying radiance, his eye can see The one, sole source from whence it flows eternally. 154 'Tis Art alone can realize to man The ancient Sage's dream, and bid arise Pure forms of Loveliness in which we scan The mind's creations fashioned to the Eyes, And unto sense the soul's deep harmonies Made palpable; from out the void of Space And Sound, new worlds of Beauty fairywise Called forth, where 'neath fit types of Power and Grace High Truths and Virtues have a sensible dwellingplace. 152 Not that the loftier mind needs outward things To aid the inner vision, or make clear And definite its high Imaginings By such material helps: the inner ear Has harmonies to which no music here, However rare, approaches: and the eye Sees not a shape of Beauty that comes near To that which for its adoration high The Soul has form'd: bright Lingerings of its native Sky! 153 Yet are these outward shapes of Loveliness Endeared to us as types of loftier things, Shadowings forth of Glory which express, However feebly, the Imaginings And Hopes to which the Soul by Instinct clings, Nor doubts save in its very Being's Spite. Nor less that Sense itself some aidance brings To the diviner Part, thus raised by right Of such high Consecration to a nobler height, 154 Endowed with higher capabilities: For in the service of the soul the Ear And Eye are holy things: the harmonies Of Nature are by them convey'd in clear And full Impressions to it, and all here, That from our boyish days has charm'd the sight, Of beautiful in earth, air, sea: all fair And holy forms that wake a calm delight, Linked with life's purest thoughts, and with the fancies bright 155 Of those blest days of Innocence and Youth, All such are by these noble faculties Imprinted on the soul in living truth: And when these outward organs fail, arise The scenes of bygone days before those Eyes That Time and Season dim not: scenes of yore Still haunted by ancestral memories That linger round the grave of Joys no more, Pale Ghosts of what were bright Realities before! 156 Oh cherish and perfect these faculties, Employ them consciously for Good, for they Are given us to perfect: Oh be wise: New worlds of Truth and Beauty every day They open up to us, that thus we may Keep still alive all holy sympathies, And wake the founts upon life's weary Way Of endless sweet Imaginings that rise From Nature's hidden springs, whose Source exhaustless lies 157 At the deep Heart, the Centre, far below The Pegasean Stroke: these Faculties Ourselves must educate: must school them so 'Till in this fair World all Things to our Eyes Grow lovely, to our Ears all Harmonies Be opened up: 'till with the same Delight And Ease with which the Child a Flute applies To his small Lip, we draw forth the whole might- -Y music of this World in all its Depth and Height! 158 Let Nature be a holy Thing to thee, Her name upon thy lips sound as a Prayer: And of this glorious temple let her be The allpervading Presence, ever there, Filling it with her majesty: in air In earth and ocean felt, an unseen power, By the calm shadow of whose Glory are All things encompassed, whence the meanest flower Can wake high thoughts, and flashings forth of hidden lore! 159 Oh study by selflowliness to know And comprehend her Laws, for Pride is still But Blindness and Delusion: what can grow From out the rank soil of a stubborn will But Ignorance, and weeds of bane to kill And choke all holy sympathies, whereby The heart is quickened, else wrapped up in chill Repulsive forms of Selfidolatry, Who magnifies himself and sees all else awry. 160 How blest in early youth who Nature finds Ere custom has enthralled, not as she seems Distorted in the false glass of men's minds, Mixed up with fancies and with feverish dreams Of things that never were, but as she beams In her own radiant form upon the eye Of him who seeks her by her own loved streams, Or on the mountaintops where fearless by The cloudhigh Brink she roams and communes with the sky! 161 While with the Wind her untamed Tresses play Luxuriant, by its Fairyphantasies Twisted at Will, and Robe whose Woof Sunray And Cloud have wrought in everchangeful Guise, To shame Art's barren Efforts: and her Eyes Like the mistpiercing Morn, and Step as free As the snowcradled Chamois's when he flies, The Stormwindsplaymate, 'mong the Rocks which she Loves most to haunt like her great Daughter Liberty! 162 The mighty Mother, whose exhaustless Breast Suckles and fosters all Things: whose so, so Capacious Womb produces without Rest All godlike Births: for that which here below Endures, to her its Being still must owe: Still from her mighty Heart to it must the Lifeblood be furnished, else its Beatings know Naught Grand or True: then happy, happy he Whom her Lips teach alone, who early taught to see 163 In her a mother, pays her with a Love, A timeoutlasting Love that changes ne'er, But, growing with his Growth, and thus inwove With the Heartsfibres still more near and dear, Becomes his Being; he an ample Ear For all her Harmonies shall have: no Tone Of natural music, how despised soe'er By those whom prurient Tastes can please alone, But shall find Echos in his Heart, clear Answers thrown 164 Back from the Spirit's Depths, where free Access To all the Voices of Humanity, In all their varying Tones of Joy, Distress, Of Grief, of Gratulation and wild Glee, Is given: and as in all Things 'tis she That prompts and speaks, so from them all he will Learn what she is: Sight ample shall his be, No microscopic Vision poring still On Art's MinutiÃ¦ which the genuine Sightnerve kill, 165 But catholic Vision seeing as they are All Things in their true Being, Use and Place, Parts of one mighty Whole, which near and far Displays the Impress and the visible Trace Of Power divine, which naught can e'er efface, Nor Time, nor Revolution, nor the Wear Of ceaseless Change: still, still the radiant Face Of Nature smiles undimmed, still doth it bear The Sign of the Allmighty fixed unchanging there! 166 To him the lowliest thing he sees and hears Is hallowed, for without Humanity He knows there is no Wisdom, and he fears To pass o'er with an unobservant eye The humblest form of Being which may lie Before his feet: Love to and from all he Gives and receives, for well he knows that by Love only unto God the Soul is free To soar, for if not Love, what else then can He be? 167 Nor can he not feel holy Sympathy For all things be they whatsoe'er they may, Knowing that one same Being equally Created them in Love, and day by day Provideth for them in his own good way And time and measure, the same Being who Watches o'er all that breathes, as well the stray As the safe sheep, and still to mercy true Feedeth the raven and the houseless sparrow too, 168 As well as man, proud man, who deems that all Is made for him in earth and sea and air; Such Love should teach him humbleness, how small Soe'er the object, still doth Wisdom care For its least wants: shall man alone then dare To deem beneath his notice that which the Great God himself looks to, that its due Share Of needful Things it lack not? God can see Naught little, for no Act of Love can little be! 169 And God when for the Worm's least Want He cares Is not less the great God whom Kings bow to, Because the Object no Proportion bears To his Allboundlessness, nay, more so; thro' Its Littleness he proves himself the true Allloving God: for how great must he be Whom least Things occupy, as grandly too As greatest! the whole God of love is He Here likewise, for his whole Love's shown, yea!e en to the 170 Least Worm, as to the Universe at large! This makes him God, for if he could feel aught As little which is placed beneath his Charge, He were not God! but if the Heart be fraught With boundless Love for the least Thing, then naught Can be small to it: and oh Man! what more Sublime Example canst thou ask? then aught By God himself, spare thou the Worm before Thy Feet, hurt not the least, least Thing, or else a sore, 171 Sore Ill wilt thou on thine own Head call down, Thou hardenest thy Heart! the worst of, yea! All Ills in one, whence all the rest have grown, Their bitter Root! the murderer even may Wash from his bloody Hand the Stain away With sweet Tears, Heaven's purifying Dew, But in the Heart once hardened Guilt must stay, Naught, naught can wash it out, for the one true Source of both Tears and Feeling then is dried up too! 172 Oh learn to live in Nature as beneath A Presence that abhors all Sin: high Power To quicken and sublime dwells in the Breath Of natural Being; to each passing Hour Its Moral link, this gives the meanest Flower, The Bird's least Song a double Charm: view this World as the true Sundial too of our Existence, on which Time marks out with his Own viewless Finger all that Mankind was and is! 173 Oh! deem it ne'er too early to begin To teach the Child; I do not mean with dead Unquicken'd Books, for what of Good therein May be, we must ourselves be quickenÃ«d First to appreciate; and oft instead Of using our own Eyes and Hearts to see And feel, we take at Secondhand, and led In Leadingstrings e'en from our Cradle, we View Things not as they are, but as they're said to be. 174 I mean the living Wisdom of the Heart Of human Love and human Sympathy, Which of all Wisdom is the better Part! Soon as the Heart beats, soon as opes the Eye, So soon begin to fashion for the Sky The Angel: to unfold its Wings, and these Are Thoughts, with these teach it to God to fly, Yea! from the first; for these we spread with Ease E'en in a Prison, and are free whene'er we please! 175 The constant first Impressions profit most; 'Tis not the Going unto Church alone On Sundays, for the seed meanwhile is lost; 'Tis not the brief Restraint before th'unknown, The stranger, 'tis the RÃ©spect hourly shown To ourownselves, to God! before whom we Stand ever: 'tis th' observing, not the one, But each Day as a Sabbath, till we see His Temple in this World, and Life one Sabbath be! 176 It is the Tuning of the daily Ear, And Eye, and Heart which makes Life's Harmony: By Fits and Starts no during Good was e'er Wrought out: the Flute if played on brokenly Gives forth no Music, even so will thy Life too â but if ye from the First teach still The Child to feel and think godlike, then by This Thought, as by a divine Egis, will He be secured, yea! as by God's Rightarm, from Ill! 177 From the first Dawn of Reason we should link High Thoughts and Feelings with all natural Things, All Sights and Sounds: a Fountain whence we drink High Admonitions and Imaginings Of Beauty and of Good, 'till like the Strings Of some sweet Instrument our Fancies be; At the least Impulse: of a Bird that sings, A falling Leaf, or aught we hear or see, Starting into a wondrous, selftaught Harmony, 178 Like the Windharp's wild Music, which the Breath Of Heaven wakes into Fairy phantasies: And oh! why not? if thus the Air beneath Its viewless Fingering can bid arise Such Music from dead Strings, oh who denies To Soul itself like Priviledge, to make The Heart yield far, far deeper Melodies From its so living Strings, which leave a Wake (At Thought's most airy Touch, or Feeling's lightest Shake) 179 Tho' not upon this dull and sensual Ear, Of neverfailing Music: evermore Starting to Life to soothe us and to cheer, And mingling with all sweetest Sounds of Yore, The Sabbathchimes, which so oft could restore My jarr'd Thoughts, Voice of Bird, or Child's glad Cry, One mighty Chain of Harmony stretched o'er The Universe, below and up on high, In whose wide Compass Nature's thousand Voices lie! 180 Oh learn to love her from thy boyish days, And link with all her forms the memories Of those dear Beings, who unto the Ways Of Truth and Virtue turned the Energies Of thy young soul; and when each fond one dies, When the sweet household-voices on thine ear Fall no more with glad welcome: when thine eyes Miss their dear forms, still shalt thou feel them near. For the Grave severs not our souls, tho' it may tear 181 These palpable Links asunder; still with thee In one same being dwell they, still they are Within thee and around unfailingly: Still in the natural forms of all this fair And goodly Universe their spirits share Thy Being: and in each remembered spot, Where with their lips thine breathed Love's sweetest air. Each Object points thro' long years unforgot, With silent finger to the paths where Sin is not! 182 And Art, still virtue's handmaid, should create Enduring forms for what abstractedly We love and worship; should impersonate All virtues, shaping to the body's eye What floated in ideal majesty Before the soul: should give an actual life Unto the Great and Good of History, That by the outward sense we may arrive At lofty thoughts, and towards high Imitation strive. 183 Art should preserve of human dignity And human Worth the primal mould: should so Stereotype each deed and feeling high That Time and Change may never lay them low: That, standing aye in Beauty, we may know Whither to bend our Eyes, whence to renew From forms that with unfading Being glow, Man's loftier Nature: refashioning him true In that sublimer Shape wherein of eld he grew. 184 Thro' her Protean Forms one soul should shine, One soul of Truth and Good, in thousand ways Varying its revelations, yet divine In all; now with sweet Music it should raise, As with an Angelsvoice, our hearts to praise The Giver of all Good; now changefully In Paintingshues its presence it betrays, And now in sculptured forms it charms the Eye, Or lifts us to the skies on wingÃ«d Poesy! 185 Thus in the common and familiar track Of weekday Being should our spirits have High visitations; nor would sense be slack (Working for Hopes and Joys beyond the grave,) To aid the soul; no more should it deprave By brute Suggestions of this sensual life, That purer being which by it doth crave Knowledge of outward things, to fill Joy's hive With sweetness from all sights and sounds the World can give 186 Like a vast Sabbathbell this World should ring The one grand Chime of Being, pealing 'till Mankind obeys the Call: thus every thing In Art and Nature's realms should serve to fill Man's soul with fairest visions, called at will From out the Abyss of Thought or that of Space; Thus should all things one mighty Truth instil, Which Time and Sin may dim but ne'er efface, That Man is born unto a nobler dwellingplace; 187 High Truth! deep Fount, with whose elysian Drops The Yearnings, Feverfret and Doubts we slake That Life is Heir to; Life! whose Flowers Grief crops, Ere Hope can see them open; Truth! which Ache, Age, mortal Woe, nor Sin itself can shake, Tho' oft obscuring: still unfailingly From Life's first Dawn its Pledge with us we take, And when the Flame in Ashes seems to die, Chance stirs them, and to Heaven the unquenched Sparks upfly! 188 Death cannot tread them out; 'tis Sin alone Allbut extinguishes their holy glow: Yet still they burn, tho' smothered, and anon Will blaze out as of yore, if Faith but blow With her lifebreath the embers, which still owe Their primal heat to her, else cold and dead. Mysterious consciousness! which on man's brow Can stamp its Immortality, and spread 'Mid Mists of Earthliness a halo round his head! 189 And Art, whose eye doth Â«glance from Heaven to Earth,Â» Looking before and after, far and near, Making her revelations of man's Birth, His Death and Being, (for her ample sphere Is as the soul of man, not bounded here To these vain shows) from her wide realms should gleam Fresh garlands of bright flowers neversere, Thought, Sense, Imagination's purest sheen, To clothe this primal Truth, that clearer felt and seen 190 In Poet's Fiction, Life's Reality, In every sensible and spiritual Form, It may be cherished as a Boon of high- -Est, holiest Import: as the primal Germ Of all true Being, which if by the Worm Of Disbelief once gnawed, then there can be Nor Fruit nor Flower, nor Strength against the Storm Of mortal Accident; for how can he Who doubts Man's highest Hope, in Man aught godlike see? 191 In Art's enduring marbles we should mould And cherish the pure type unfailingly Of national character: thus may we hold The mirror to the Nation's face, and see How Time hath changed it; whether it still be Like our fifth Harry's, when upon the plain Of Agincourt, the God of Victory, His foes before him fled, like drops of rain Swept by the tempestblast, nor turned to look again; 192 His spirit walks among us still, it lives In Shakespeare's everliving page, whose Song Sounds as a shout of Victory which gives To English ears delight, and wakes a throng Of glorious recollections, which belong Thro' him unto all ages; the dark grave Which closes over Empire's wrecks, no wrong Hath done to Milton, for his Fame might save A nation's memory from dark Oblivion's wave! 193 Truth is Omnipotent: and when high Art In visible beauty clothes her, and doth make Her as a palpable Presence, every heart Must worship her: for she alone can break The fetters of that thralldom which doth take Prisoner the soul; she can impart the grace Of pure Belief to Blasphemy, and shake With her calm voice the proud throne to its base, And with her steadfast glance all darkness straight efface! 194 But we are Idolworshippers, we have No more the Â«vision and the faculty Divine,Â» But travel onward to the Grave Bent down beneath the heavy misery Which Mammon lays on us. Art is a lie, A vain Word, not the Breath of God for aye Subliming and renewing; to naught high Her Votaries toil, but for the passing Day, Greedy of Fame that fades like a vile Breath away! 195 Art has no moral Aim: she no more strives To make great Men and Citizens: to show In her still Forms how genuine worth survives The Pomps and Vanities which Time lays low: She teaches not whence man's real Power must grow, From what deep Source the Beautiful, the True, And the enduring Mighty ever flow. And if the Man be not first godlike, thro' What can the Artist then aught godlike feel or do? 196 Just in the same Proportion that he is A better man, in that too will he be A better Artist! first then perfect this, For as the lesser in the greater, the Good Artist is implied in this: and he The masterartist is, who moulds not dead, Cold Stone, but who has taught his Eye to see, His Heart to feel godlike! yea! he may spread Fairer than Raphael's Hues, or near a Shakespeare tread! 197 Until the Heart be godlike, can the Hand Throw aught of Godlike on the Canvass? aught Beyond what with the Ellwand may be spann'd Of Rule and Precedent? until the Thought Kindle and glow, can the cold Lip be fraught With Words that burn? No! till the Man then be Great in God's Sight, the artist can be naught: He has no Inspiration, that is, the Pure Breath of God, without which God none feel or see! 198 This Art, this Inspiration is no more! We are no more great Men, and therefore no Great Artists rise: we have no Faith, therefore We work no Miracles! we worship now The Brute and the Mecharical, which show Like India's hundredhandÃ«d Gods placed by The Apollo's Strength of Beauty; thus we bow To physical Force, and sick we know not why, Most natural Relief! to coarse Excitement fly. 199 How does the Lord of Hosts assert his Right, How make his Presence felt resistlessly Within Guilt's Breast? not by the wingÃ«d Might And Terrors of his Thunders: Mockery Of merely physical Fears, felt briefly by The outward Man, and with the Body's Throes Forgot; in the soft Whisper is He nigh Of Conscience, the dread Witness! whose Voice grows Louder than Thunder, yet breaks not the Babe's Repose! 200 Tho' by its light Breath not the least Leaf would Be shaken, nor unto the outward Ear The least Sound sent, yet from it if he could The inward Man would hide himself in Fear: Quaking as some dim Spectreform drew near, By the dread sense of its Reality To Feeling, tho' not unto Sight made clear; It whispers, 'tis God's Voice! it looks, and by The Flash revealed, he sees God's calm, reproving Eye! 201 Th' Eternal, how do we create it? say, With Stone and Iron? No! Time claims all these, He lays his Hand on them, they pass away And are forgotten! the hard Rocks decrease As the Wave washes them, the Soft with Ease Wearing away the Hard! how wouldst thou make Th' Eternal then? in Noiselessness and Peace The Thought can build what Ages shall not shake, And a few Words of Truth the Spear and Sword can break! 202 What is it that upholds the Stars of Heaven In their bright Courses, and controuls the Sea? 'Tis the sphereruling Law by Wisdom given, That so, so gently yet resistlessly Draws Worlds into their Places, tho' they be More countless than the Seasands! this is Power And Wisdom: which are one eternally; Which bows the Neck of Nations to the Hour Of Retribution, as the passing Wind the Flower! 203 What shakes the Nerve, a Thought can overthrow! True Strength is Faith, Love, Truth, for with their Aid Man is allselfsufficient, both to know, To do and suffer: needing no Parade Of Proofs and Helps sought but when Faith is dead. For Faith were Faith no longer, if need were Of palpable Signs and Revelations made Unto the outward Man; Sense mocks the mere Faint Wordbelievers, for within they see not clear: 204 He who feels that grand Miracle, which as His Soul each bears within him, will not view Those which for Wonders with the Vulgar pass With much Amazement: he sees the one true Spirit in all Things, and the more it thro' Forms spiritual Works, the clearer he Can trace it, and most in his own Soul too, Its purest Form, God's Spirit, boundless, free, And feeling this, what else with Wonder should he see? 205 St. Thomas needs must touch Christ's Body, for He doubted, his frail Faith was half ha Lie, For Sense with heavenly Things is still at War: And he who needs must with his Bodyseye Behold, sees with his Soul's but filmily! Faith is a perfect Whole, all Eye, all Ear, Not each, as in the Flesh, a Faculty Distinct and limited: thus she has clear Authentic Signs when brute Sense nought can see or hear. 206 The true Divinity of Poesy, Its Beauty and its holy Power to wake The Hearts of men to virtue, does not lie In its loud Thunderings, which only break The blessÃ«d calmness of the Soul, and shake It with vain Tumult, but in Feelings true And deep, whose Undercurrents ceaseless take In quiet Strength their Course, returning to Th' eternal Ocean from whose Depths their Source they 207 Yea! Poesy, like Conscience, has her still, Small Voice, yet in its Gentleness, 'tmay be, As strong to rouse, and with high Thoughts to fill The Soul, that from vain Passion's Tumult free, Lends willing Ear to its calm Witchery. Her Shell, like Ocean's, has a Voice that speaks Of her far heavenly Source, her Office high, And of the End th' indwelling Spirit seeks, Totune the Soul's fine Strings, which Passion's rude Hand breaks! SEASONCHANGES, THEIR SIGNS, AND MORAL. When Summerfruits have ripened sweet, When Winds are sighing, and Flowers dying, And latest are blinking in Brake and Dell: When Autumnleaves are first windflying, And rainbowhued by the ripening Spell Of sunbaked Juices that downward fleet From the seasoned Boughs i'the Roots to dwell In their Wintercells, when old Carles tell By Ingleblaze their Christmasstales, That smack of the Taste of ancient Days, And the Newyearmidnightsdream is told To the Flameflap and the whistling Gale's Wild Wintermusic, as he lays Some stout Oak low, and the Blood runs cold Of the prickeared Urchin, 'neath the Charm Of braincoined Fears and spritewrought Harm; And good, old Songs, Heartmusic, meet For Merrymakings where the Heart Takes a new Lease of Life and Love, Are sung by household Lips, so sweet To wiser Minds, who play their Part On Life's calm Homestage, far above Ambition's vain heartfevering Cares Soulsoiling Wealth, and all the Fears Of him whose Mind is not his own, But fashioned at Opinion's Beck, Cameleonlike, a Bubble blown By every Breath of Folly thro' The Void wherein 'tis born and dies: With no Selfstrength, Selfworth or Hue, But borrowed all, like Atomies Windlifted in the Sumbeamstrack. When Summerfeelings pass away With the bright Things that gave them Birth, They leave their Sweetness in the Heart, By Thought's Honeybees preserved, And for Aftertimes reserved; Thought's Honeybees, whose Summerday Tho' gone, has left a sober Mirth, Which shall endure with kindly Ray To lighten o'er the Winterhearth: In the Hour of outward Dearth A Taste of past Joys to impart: As the Honey still retains The Flavor which the Flower gave, When this to charm no more remains, And Wisdom that alone can save; Their Colors, Forms and Scents and Hues, The Soul can take from outward Things, And with them recreate past Views: Like the Wildeagle it has wings Of unseen Motion, which will bear It cloudwards from this Prisonscene, And give it Visions, fresh and fair. When all Fruits, ripe to the Core, Swell to Bursting: when no more You can see the toppling Wain, Crowned with Cere's golden Grain, Filling all the narrow Lane, And as creaking on it goes, Leaving Cornspikes on the Rows Of the Hedgesideelms, which spread In groinlike Arches overhead. When the Garners brimfull tell That the Earth has yielded well, Paying back Man's Toil and Care With all Gifts and Produce fair, Teaching many a Lesson high In her wise Economy: How to turn to fitting Use Means which men too oft abuse, And e'en in most despisÃ«d Things To seek and find high Ministrings. When the Rainbowharvests all Are gathered in, and none to fall 'Neath Hook or Sickle now remain, 'Tis a Sign that Summer's Train Has departed: that again Prudence, Toil, and Hope begin A new Race, repeating in The selfsame Track, the selfsame Round Of the Season's narrow Bound, The Image of the former Year, As in a Glass reflected clear. When the Stubblefield, closeclipped, Tells that Harvesthome is done, Tho' Fancy still can think she hears, (Cheating her Heart from Winterfears) The Harvestcarols dieing on Her charmÃ«d Ear, and sheafÃ«d Corn Loudrustling in the Breeze, or borne To the careful Granary There to be stacked high and dry For the Wintersuse, or Years Of scanty Growth: when now frostnipp'd Flowers hang drooping 'neath the Morn, Tho' the Lark still soars the Sky, As tho' Winter's dreaded Name Not one Pulse of Joy could tame, Seasonfree, as unto him All Times and Places were the same; When the Swallow's swift Wings skim The Foamwave that sparkles by, Speeding blithely whence he came: When the cawing Rooks do gather Sticks and Straws for Winterweather, Architects who build and plan, Tho' unschooled, as well as Man, With his Terms of Art precise, And his Rules and Measures nice. When the redcheeked Apple falls, And from the purplestainÃ«d Grapes, Droppingripe on warm Southwalls, The Nectarjuice almost escapes: When from Summer's parting Lip Their last Beautytinge they take, Fragrant Hues and Scents that make The wandering Bee athirst to sip: Dewwine with warm Sunbeams blent, That might fill the Veins nighspent Of Age with Vigor â Bunches such As in his rosyfingered Clutch, (Sweet as kisses, full and lush) Bacchus 'self was wont to crush When with Frolic, Mirth and Glee, And manyvoicÃ«d Revelry, From the Middayheart he strayed Thro' Nysa's echohaunted Shade, Where the Dryads answered him 'Mid the Alleys faint and dim, And the manyfountained Glade By the Birds was vocal made, While from some widebranching Oak Came the Woodman's far off Stroke, Far, far from the sacred Spot Which Man's foot disturbÃ«d not; There on heaped up Flowers he'd lie Counting the Moments as they fly, Grapeberries for his Rosary: Whose Nectardrops seemed to his Mouth Sweet as the Breath of the sweet South, Trickling o'er his laughing Lip, As with Head held back he'd sip, While old Silenus watched the Boy, And held his Sides, and laughed for Joy: Now when 'neath their leafy Palls Tender Flowerets buried lie, Yielding to harsh Destiny, From which nothing fair escapes, And the Hoarfrost weaves Fancyshapes, 'Till the thawing Sunbeam falls; For Nature has her Fancies too, And with the Clouds and with the Winds She fashions Pictures evernew, At her sweet Will like Poetminds, Who are but Utterers of Things Which she has sent thro' Ear and Eye Unto the Heart, which o'er them flings The Charm of human Feeling high, The sweet Touch of Humanity. The Heart, which by its Hopes and Fears, Its Yearnings, Joys and Loves endears The meanest Thing, till it can give An Impulse unto all who live: Yes! in Nature's every Form, In Cloud, in Sunshine and in Storm, In Voice of Stream or Song of Bird, In all that's seen and all that's heard, One Spirit still is hovering nigh, The Soul of all her Poesy; Typ'd in the Echo's mystic Voice That bids the Heart of Man rejoice To think the universal Soul, Pulsing thro' each Part and Whole, A sympathetic Response gives Unto everything that lives. 'Tis from this eternal Source Each smaller Stream derives it Course Supplied like Rivers from the Sea, And flowing thither constantly. Of all Nature's Harmonies The corresponding Keynote lies In Man's Soul, and every Part Hath an Echo in his Heart, As a Mirror where you see All Things in Epitome: The moral World and physical, The outward and the inner, all Form one vast and perfect whole, Moved by one pervading Soul. And the highest Poet he Who of the vast Machinery At the Centre stands and sees Creation rise by due Degrees, And with Wisdom's Masterkey Unlocks the Soul of Harmony. When Grasshopper, chirping late, Easing thus his merry Heart Not from Cares but Overjoy, Tells that Summer's out of Date, Yet thereat no Fears annoy His blithe Spirit, not one Smart For lost Moments, Wishes ill, As he sang, so sings he still: In his Lifesdregs keeping holy That Joyessence fresh and clear, Free from Taint of Melancholy, Which from Nature, when the Year Saw his Birthday young like him, He received, a Boon of Glory Man might envy, whom a whim, A mere Nothing can o'erdim, Changing Joy's Smile to a Tear, From his Cradle to his Bier: Everseeking, nevertasting, Some Airform of Fancy grasping, Present moments everwasting For those that come not for his Asking: And when come not worth the Tasking Wherewith Fancy, sick at Heart, Ransacked all her slippery Art, Giving to Time's future Shape Graces, in their stead the Ape, Grinning Mockery, to find: Disappointment hid behind The form of ripe Fruition When the Bubbledream is gone! When the Redbreast whistles blithe, Taking of sweet Song his fill, Tho' the other Birds be still, And the Lambs fullsized bleat strong, Wellwool'd gainst the Winterschill, When no more the Reapingscythe Finds a Cornstalk to cut down, And the Stubblefield looks brown: When the formless Vapor shows Objects indistinct and wrong, When the Daylight shorter grows, And Owl and Bat's Delight is long: When nigh eveless Night draws on, Waiting scarce for Set of Sun, Like Enchantress, whose high Spell Works a sudden Miracle. When the Nightingale's Spellsong Is rare heard the Brakes among, Now by ruder Sounds o'erblown Which from Winter take their Tone, The harshvoicÃ«d Wind 'tmay be, With rudeseasoned Rivalry, Or the Nightbirds bolder made By the lengthened Eveningshade; When the Peasant, weatherwise Shakes his grey Head at the Skies, By his blazing Cottageflame Mutters Winter's chilly Name, Lives o'er the Past in many a Tale, And prophecies, and quaffs his Ale: While the Fire's fitful Blaze On his sunburnt Features plays, And in Chimneynook to sleep Tired Dog and Urchin creep. When the Weathersigns are rife Telling of new Season's Life, And all Creatures, instinctwise, Tho' taught not to philosophize, Now prepare, each in his Way, To protract Life's little Day; When the Hazelnuts fullgrown To the Squirrel ripely shown, Thro' the scant Leaves plump and brown, Give a Relish to his Tooth Epicures might grudge in Sooth: And the Acorns pattering To the Swine a rich Treat bring, While the passing Traveller sees Them grunting 'neath the windshook Trees. Now when all Earth's living Creatures Tell of change in Time's old Features, And thy own Heart, plainer still Than falling Leaf or faded Hill, Tells thee that the Summer's flown, With all Joys that thou hast known, When thou feel'st that, like the Year, Thy Heart too is in the sere And yellow Leaf, that it must be Changed in its fancied Unity: Reflect but shattered Fragments now Like broken Glass of former Joy, And of its former Self retain Dull Memory with present Pain: The Remnants of a Joy which was A perfect Whole, ere Time the Glass Of Hope had broke, whose Fragments now But multiply an idle Show, Which puzzles still the cheated Eye That vainly would identify. Take Courage Heart, for here below What are such Things but idle Show, Whose whole Worth in thyself doth dwell Created by thy Magicspell. According as thou turn'st to good Or evil Use Time's changeful Mood, So, like the Wind the Eagleswings, 'Twill lift thy Soul to higher Things Than those whereon the Eye doth rest, Or make thee level with the Beast Who lives but unto Time and Earth, Whereof his Food and Joys have Birth. But thou that draw'st from such mean Source Only thy Body's brieflived Force, Shouldst not submit thy Soul thereto. But to its Service these subdue, Nor from the changeful Seasons here Take Argument of Hope or Fear. When thy Heart with outward Things Tells that Time upon his Wings Has thy Summerfancies stole, And far from th' imagined Goal, Still thy Hopes keep toiling on For Joys that seemed already won, And in Future trust to find Bliss that shall not cheat the Mind, More than all thou'st left behind; Tho', if thou think'st well, there is Nor surer, nor a greater Bliss, For what so sure as that which thou Dost enjoy, not thinking how Or when or where it is enjoyed, Lost in the Bliss, which is destroyed Or past, when you begin to think Of what it is: then does it shrink Up from a boundless Joy to a Cold Reflex of what's passed away. When all these Signs tell the Year Hath laid Summer on his Bier, When all Fruits are gathered in, And our indoor Joys begin, When the fixed Mind seeks at Home Bliss for which Fools vainly roam, When in sober Thought it tastes Sweeter Joys than Summer wastes, Who, too lavishly profuse Of Pleasure scarcely knows its Use, Plucking Fruit and smelling Flower As Winter had o'er these no Power, Who severely wise and kind, Concentrates within the Mind. When at Wisdom's Harvesthome, Gleaning from the fleeting Doom And quick change of earthly Things Bright Truths and high Aspirings, It selfcentred in the Sphere Of Desires calm and clear Moves on unto its true End, E'en as kindred Stars do bend In one Constellation knit, To the Source from whence they're lit. Then look thro' thy Heart, and say What the Summer in its Day Has ripened there of Good and Bright, That may glad thy Aftersight. Has it had its Harvesthome, Its Springgrowth and its Summerbloom, And when Bloom has passed away, Has it had its Seedingday, Of wellripened, seasoned Thought, From Experience duly bought: Of wise Joys, which in the Mind Seeds of better leave behind, Joys by Sorrow touched and tried, And freed from earthly Dross and Pride: Such as unreproved and free, Sweeten Aftermemory, Like Scents which tho' lost in Air, Leave a longbreathed Odor there: Has the Summer left for thee In the Soul's high Granary, Produce not of hasty Growth, But of wellmaturÃ«d Worth? Fellowcreature Love and Peace, With a Mind and Heart at Ease, An high Trust in human Worth, Whence true selfrespect has Birth, And a Love for everything Which with Man holds Communing, From the meanest Worm that creeps To the Babe that cradled sleeps On his Mother's lovestirred Breast, Like a young Bird on the Nest; Has the Summer left thy Heart That which passes Show, the Art, Like wise Nature, to prepare From the Past a Future fair? From thine undisturbÃ«d Breast To create a high Selfrest, And as Earth seems barren round Yet has rich seeds underground, In the Winter of thy Day Still to foster Faith's pure Ray. As the Earth within her Breast, When she seems at barren Rest, Still prepares in her good Time Coming Springs, and from the Slime Of the brute Soil moulds to Life Forms with Grace and Beauty rife. So within thy inmost Soul, Striving towards a higher Goal, From this Life's Impediments And the Body's downward Bents, Frame thou the Wings to upward Aims, As from the gross Wood rise pure Flames. In thy Spirit's fertile Womb Mould its Shapes not for the Tomb: There let Faith beget on Love The Angel thou shalt be above! From Life's dull and Winterclime Prepare the Springs of coming Time, Thus the Seasons o'er thy Heart Pass and leave no fretting Smart, Each in its own kind is good Tho' they yield a different Food: Still for Immortality Thought from all can draw supply: Meanings from the falling Leaf, Warnings from things sweet and brief, Thoughts too deep for Words in Things To which homedear Memory clings: Food for Love in all we see, For Love is the Lifefaculty, The high Basis-element, Where noblest Things take nobler Bent, In which alone they breathe and fly, Unfold their Wings and seek the Sky. Thus pass the fleeting Shows of Things, These Time takes off, e'en as he brings, While the pure Soul unchanged doth lie Selfcentred in its Unity! Lies not Life's true Worth in Thought, Are not hence its best Hues caught? Can we not in Soul pass in To the Promiseland, and win Even to Reality Some Shadow of that purer Sky? View, like the Hebrew, from afar The Land which earthly Senses bar? Is it not enough to think And, as with a Lethedrink, Gnawing Sorrows melt away In the Warmth of Faith's full Ray: She feels not the Weight of Years, In her Eye are no dim Tears, She knows neither Age nor Youth, For her Being is a Truth, And all Truth unchanging is, No Cameleonhues are his, In old Hearts and young the same, Burning as their Altarflame. Tho' I bodyold may be Still heartyoung I'll taste the Glee Of all Things that in my Youth Were to me a weekday Truth: Ever in the Hope before me, As with Prophetseye I'll see From the Rainbow's Cloudpath rise Shadowings of bright Mysteries, Wherein the Soul doth trust to be What here it seems but scantily. Still shall Fancy to me bring Flowers of Springblossoming, Buds of southern Hue and Clime In the chill mid wintertime, With the ripest Summerfruits And a Mood that therewith suits! And tho' fullripe they be not, I'll not quarrel with my Lot, But the ripe Half thankfully Eat, nor linger greedily Till the whole shall ripened be: Grateful what the Seasons give Will I take, and learn to live, As the wise Bee, who doth hive From each Flower, as it blows, The Honey which Delay would lose: Like him, mould each different Store Into Wisdom's compact Lore, Giving her enduring Taste To Sweets which one brief Hour might waste, For no Joy is perfect here, Half is ripe, and half is sere, Half in Disappointment's Shade, Half by Hope's warm Sun o'errayed: I'll pluck it as it chance to be, Half is worth the Whole to me: Fancy still shall bring me Pleasures From an whole Life's scattered Treasures, She shall plant in my old Breast Youth's wise Heart with all Life's best, Make me as I was of old Ere Life's weary Tale was told, Thus, for ever young, the Heart Changes with Alchymic Art To pure Gold the Dross of Things, Plucking from Time's rapid Wings Feathers for a higher Flight, When it feels fullfledged its Might. From Doubt's curious Questionings, Flashings forth of hidden Things Drawing stronger Faith and Love: Quickened Pulses that do move In a holier Unison, (Like agemellowed eldtime Song Sung in Nature's Ear so long,) With the hidden Heart of Things, Throb for Throb, mysterious Yearnings; Thus as Life shall near its End, Wisely I the Dregs will spend: They shall not be troubled Lees Where all Taste of Goodness dies, But a genial Liquor still, Fit to cheer the Heart at will. Thus I'll pluck, on the Gravesbrink, Life's last Flowers ere I sink, Thus my last Earthglance shall be Sweet as closing Minstrelsy, Or as the calm Sunsetray Betokening a fairer Day. And the first Taste of Heavensbliss Mingle with the last of this! Thus my Heart with sober mirth Shall await its second Birth, Selfmoulded to that inward Form Which outlives both Time and Storm! THOUGHTS ON TRUE AND FALSE AMBITION. 1. As is the Age, so shines Truth's heavenlit Torch, If base and troubled, o'er Time's troublous Tide It sends avenging Brightness, Rays that scorch, Which Hearts of earthy Temper ne'er abide; If pure, a Dayspring raying far and wide: A Glance of the eternal God, sent thro' The Mists of Time, and melting in their Pride The Thrones and Mockeries of Earth like Dew, To teach the Nations what is False and what is True! 2. Truth is the Vesta of the Human Heart That hallows with immortal Spell the Shrine: No splendid Fiction taught by Pagan Art, But a pervading Life and Light divine! The Flame on God's best Altar! let naught tine Its Brightness then; once spent, it cannot by Mere earthly Fire be relit: in thine Own Heart then all that's Great and Good must die, And like a Heap of Ashes cold and smouldering lie! 3. Say if my Tongue has erred, benignant Shade, Thou best of Greece's Sons, inspired Sage, For Truth dwelt in thee, in her Likeness made, Spoke with thy Lip, and lit thy Martyrage! She made the Poison but a Drink to suage Thy Thirst: the Draught of Immortality! Socrates was a Foretype of Christ.Thou Shadow of that Form not yet shaped by Time's Womb, thus cast beforehand, as its Gage! Let him who doubts thy Life, behold thee die; God's Star of Promise in the Pagan's empty Sky! 4. And Thou! whose Eye beheld Her visibly: Milton. A Host tho' single, and thy Name a Spell! A voice from out the Past which prompts the Free, Reechoing back from Heaven like the Swell Of Ocean or the Thunder's Shout, that well Might wake a sleeping World! its far off Roll Rings on Time's ample Ear, who yet shall tell Thy Name, when grateful Freedom wins her Goal! Thou gav'st thine Eyes to see the better with thy Soul! 5. Chosen of God! he dimmed thy Sight to pour A fuller Inspiration on thine Ear, To make thee more his own: more strong to soar Above this narrow Earth's Â«diurnal Sphere,Â» Snatched from its Sorrows it was thine to hear, In Commune sweeter far than Fancy dreams, The calm, deep Voice of Truth in Accents clear Not faint as to Earth's grosser Sense it seems; She took thy Harp and tuned it to her chosen Themes! 6. Methinks I see thy earnest Brow of Thought With its own Glory haloed: even so Is Moonlight soft by timetouched Ruins caught, Thy Face is worn and pale, but not with Woe, 'Tis the frail Flesh that yields to the Mind's Flow, Wasting its channel, an unwasting Stream, To the Worldocean flowing! but whence, oh! Whence, on thy wan cheek, that transfiguring Beam, Making thy faded Face, as if transparent, gleam? 7. It is that Thought, Â«which thro' the World's vain Mask, See Milton's XVII Sonnet, where he alludes with unspeakable noblemindedness to his Blindness, and finds his Solace in a lofty contempt of present things. and in his own conscience: it is truly refreshing to turr from the Impotence that whines over imaginary Grief, to Milton's Godlike Patience under the severest calamity. Content tho' blind, hadst thou no better Guide, Might have conducted thee,Â» which made thy Task A Glory and a Blessedness â thy wide And ample Brow is flushed with lawful Pride, Bent gently down as if touched lightly by The Finger of thy God; Flesh cannot hide That Soul, which needing not the Body's Eye, Flashes o'er Time like God's Glance o'er Eternity! 8. Thy Tongue was tipp'd with Prophet's hallowed Fire, Melting the brazen Idols of the Earth And Coinage false, like Heaven's far Flash of Ire, Thy thought was mighty as an Earthquakesbirth, And like a knell, thy Voice came on the Mirth Of Tyrants in their Palaces, and broke The Chains that bound man's Spirit, to new Worth And Life reclaimed; with oftrepeated Stroke Fell Superstition's Pile, and slumbering Nations wole' 9. Full many are the gallant Hearts that shed Their best Blood on the Shrine of Liberty, Vain Sacrifice! still mourning hath she fled From Strife and Tumult back to her own Sky. Her true Form rare has shone on Man's dim Eye: Their Zeal but struck the Shackles from the Limbs, Not from the Soul: but Milton's Purpose high With wing unwearied Milton was still greater as a man than as a Poet, and his services to that Freedom which is the most valuable; may, which alone deserves the Name, are incalculable. be directed his profound Intellect not against the everchanging outward shape of Tyranny, but against its Sources in the human mind, Prejudice and Intolerance. up to Heaven climbs For her calm Light which still the inward Eye sublime, 10. Far other weapons than vain Sword and Spear Are needed for her Conquests: and he who Would these atchieve must on his bosom wear Armour of her own Forgeing, tempered true With Fire from which Vulcan never drew Achilles' Mail, than that securer far: And he, the happy warrior, must thro' Far other schools have passed than that of War, Mind has its Triomphs too, these only lasting are! 11. Yea! calm and quiet Victories, won by That best of Weapons, Man's eternal Thought, 'Gainst which all others are but Mockery: For Thought alone can combat Thought, and aught Less Divine with it into Contact brought, To its own Dust, as by the Lightning's Flame, Is straightway turned: with this our Milton wrought, He wielded it, but only in God's name, And still it burns and warms as when from Heaven it came! 12. His Virtue was no gaudy, glittering Flower That in some sheltered Corner feebly blows, But shone, Faith's Rainbow, o'er the stormiest Hour, And drew, as Fire from Fuel, strength from woes: E'en as the Giantoak untended throws His gnarlÃ«d Arms athwart th' injurious Blast, As o'er his native element, and shows Best when most tried, thus firm unto the last Thro' him we reap the Seed which on the Storm he cast! 13. He ploughed the Field of Revolution, which No meaner Hand could or had dared to do: He made its very Weeds the Soil enrich, And sowed therein his mighty Thoughts, the true And only Seed of Freedom: and they grew In those wild Struggles when the Human Mind Was passing from worn Customs into new And purer Forms: amid that Chaos blind Enlarging, like the Light, a Rainbow o'er Mankind! 14. Milton! such Names as thine shall not go down To the rank Dust: the Grave is not for thee: Thro' furthest Ages, as thro' Clouds the Sun, Thy Fame shall shine on still: with Armoury Of Truth's own Forgeing well may it defy The shafts of Time and Envy: tho' the land That gave thee Birth had left thy Memory To its own Brightness: yet e'en as a Brand Subdued awhile 'twould burst, by Glory's full Breath fann'd. 15. And tho' fond Veneration stood not nigh, Nor Love, nor Friendship hallowed with a Tear The thankless Tomb, which as in Mockery, The Nations grant to virtues which their Fear And Envy make them hate, when they can bear Their Sins no more, yet will not turn away From old Abominations till they are A selfin flicted Scourge: yet not one Ray Of Glory should be lost to thy suredawning Day; 16. And tho' no pious Hand in Love had sown Thy Grave with Flowers, or had planted there The Laurel, yet selfspringing it had grown More bright than Plant of mortal Birth! so fair A Wreath that Angels would be proud to wear It for thy sake; the Elements are not So slow as Man's Affections: Nature where He has neglected sanctifies the Spot, Nor lets the holy Bones in dull Oblivion rot! 17. Allselfsufficient in the Giantmight Of thine unyielding Will, whose Energy Could mould e'en Fate and Fortune; from the Blight Of Elements that crush a Mind less high Thou drew'st thy Soul's Perfection, as the Sky The Beauty of the Rainbow from the Throes Of her celestial Bosom â dormant lie Man's Faculties, and he himself scarce knows That which he is, 'till Time and Circumstance disclose. 18. There is no Ill, rightnamed, save that which springs From the rank Soil of Guilt, all other woes Are evil but as borne; they leave no stings In Bosoms which, like thine, submit the Shows Of outward Being to the Prophetthroes And Yearnings of the Spirit: and thus rise By aid of that which is, to that which knows No outward Emblem; which enshrinÃ«d lies In the deep Heart of Hearts, and shapes it for the Skies! 19. Truth's best Apostle! thou from visible Things, From this vain World's most idle Pageantry Couldst draw the Invisible: and mad'st thee Wings To higher Aims from those which mortal be, Turning Earth's Gifts to divine Agency! And when unto Life's Weekdaytasks we turned From the calm Sunset of thy Majesty, The Sabbathpeace in thy high Converse earned, Still 'mid its Turmoil vain, attended us once learned! 20. As Prophets, visionrapt, we stood again On this dull Earth: not of it, tho' upon; But sanctified, and in Life's mortal Pain Wiser to see the Good that may be won, Fitter to suffer and to do: to shun The Selfishness of Pride, and meekly wise And with a fearful Selfrespect as one Who knows that he may fall, to seek the Prize The calm and Sabbathheart whence no vain murmursrise! 21. Divinest Bard! thou stand'st alone and as The earthoergazing Peak, whereon the Ray Of Heaven's glory lingers when its Base Clouds and thick Darkness mantle: when the Day Rises and sets in Beauty 'tis to lay His first, last Tribute there, the Mountainsbrow With Glories wreathing: how can we repay The Debt of Gratitude or fitly show Thy Praises forth, unless we strive like thee to grow? 22. How few among Ambition's dazzled Train May claim the lofty Homage of that Mind Which seeks but in eternal Things its Gain, And from whose Eyes Truth blows the mists that blind. From a fixed Point 'tis his to view Mankind, While past his Rock of Safety sweep Life's Tides Disturbed by Quicksands and each crossing Wind! While his own Bark at Anchor calmly rides He sees Ambition's Wrecks, sad Tokens! on all Sides! 23. He hears the Avalanche destructive fall From its too dizzy Height: that very Height And Bulk but hasten its Decay, and call Th 'expectant Elements, whose envious Might Sweeps the long growth of Ages from our sight To its first Nothingness â he sees how mad (For far above himself, he judges right,) Are those who climb; that most with Tempest clad And Cloud, the highest Moutains are most bleak and sad! 24. And he who would ascend their airy Brow Must leave Earth's peaceful Pleasures far behind, No more may pluck the simple Flowers that grow Around the Base, but in their stead will find The shrieking Eagle and the opposing Wind; Too late the rash Intruder with faint Breath And beating Heart will learn, all Hope resigned, That to turn is to fall, to climb on Death, And Heaven no nearer tho scorn'd Earth lie far beueath! 25. Such is Ambition's fatal Path! and those Who win his maddening Goal are like the Wave Which at its topmost Height o'erbalanced grows, Bursting in Foam and Emptiness, the slave, The brieflived Agent of the Storm which gave It Birth, to which its borrowed strength it owes, Which ceasing, then it sinks back to its Grave, The Ocean of the Past from whence it rose, Spent in vain struggles with a thousand meaner Foes! 26. Ambition feeds upon opinion, lives But in the Breath of Men: he makes his Mind The Mirror of Men's Hopes and Fears, and strives To swell his daring Wing with fickle Wind Of Admiration, but, poor Fool, will find Worse Lot than Icarus! vain Pomp and State Make the weak Eye to its own Ruin blind, Till either o'erstrain'd Favor turns to Hate, Or master of himself no more, he courts his Fate! 27. He is a Proteus, and his Form will shape To suit Men's Fancies be they what they may, Evil or good, nought in himself, the Ape Of human Nature: â let the mad World say, He changes straight, false Actor in Life's Play, O'erstepping ever Nature's Modesty 'Till the fooled crowd itself at length repay With Scorn such Bombast and vile Travesty; Forstill to all that's false Man's Heart soon gives the Lie! 28. Whence is Ambition's strength? ask thine own Heart: The Weakness and the Vice, the Crimes of Man, These are the Steppingstones and this the Art By which he soars aloft, beyond the Span Of dull Imaginations â if he can But reach the Goal, it matters little by What means: tho' discord be called on to fan The Embers of Dissention, or God's high And holy Name itself be used to cloak a Lie! 29. In him the vices of Mankind grow to A Head: and as the Body chance to be More or less sound, so still in measure true, A less or greater Scourge to it will he Be also found; so beautifully the Great God makes Vice to punish itself here, And that precisely too in the Degree It merits! to a Hair the Balance clear He keeps, or if tis swayed, 'tis but by Mercy's Tear! 30. Hence is Ambition strong, for few are weak Who cast off Conscience â he on high will soar, Higher from being blindfold, and must break His neck to prove his charmÃ«d Life no more. He deems not that the fitful Blast which bore His Wing thus high can fail or dash to Earth, Nor doubts when Passion's stormy Billows roar His voice can quiet them or give them Birth, Poor Tool in God's high Hand, worthless, save as of worth 31. Thro' that which the Allwise works out with it, Turning it to far higher Ministry Than any unto which itself seemed fit. For all Things work in the Taskmaster's Eye, Yet knowing not of what they do the Why. The How or Wherefore; and the narrow Ends They had in view are turned to Mockery, In Spite of their Foxwisdom: for God mends With the Destroyer's Hands the Evil he intends! 32. Thus often Heaven, in Forbearance wise, Will curse with full Success, and gratify The wildest Wishes which from Man's Heart rise With impious Flight to desecrate the Skies. For boundless Wishing must be Misery! Each Prayer, as granted, doth itself belie, Thus wishing still for more we see in vain The full, deep Stream of Fortune flowing by: Like Tantalus, we taste and taste again, Yet still the Thirst returns, and still our Lips we straial 33. To be the Fool of Fools or Knave of Knaves, A Puppet on Life's Stage, an acted Lie, A Bubble tossing upon Passion's waves, A name which loud, yet echoless must die; To be a Byword thro' all History, To knead the Bread of Sin with human Blood, To be forgot, or dogged by Infamy, Which like the Spectrebloodhound, Conscience, should Track Guilt throughout all Time, this is Ambition's Mood! 34. And yet how many in their Folly deem This Broad daynightmare of the Soul a Sign Of Strength and Greatness, not a troublous Dream Of mere Disease begot, such as was thine Napoleon! thou Drunk, but not with Wine! With vain Imaginations and with Blood! Full Scope was given to each mad Design, And like a petted child, each changing mood Permitted, 'till thy mind to Poison turned its Food'! 35. Thou wouldst have been far more than Man, yet wast Far less: for he who oversteps that Sphere Is a false Being; around him are cast His own Devices, like a net, whence ne'er His Soul itself can disentangle; Fear, And Care and Doubt and selftormenting Thought, These fill his Hourglass: its sole Sands here; And Mockeries wild from wilder Day dreams wrought, Watch o'er his Pillow with the thorns of conscience fraught; 36. And by him stands the Past, dim Shape of Dread, The Shadow of his Soul, which still moves on With him, still more gigantic, nor when dead Forsakes him, like that by his Body thrown. To its Medusa's glance which turned to stone, Is but a Fiction; Like a Murderer's Its stealthy Step, and in one Hand, scarceshown, It holds the Poison which wheree'er he stirs It mixes with his Food, an allembittering Curse! 37. His Conquests only who has taught Mankind A Truth can be enduring, for he by The Godlike works the Godlike: to the Blind He gives clear Sight, and still the more their Eye Looks thro' him and his Works, to test and try, The grander they appear: he rules men thro' That which is noblest in them, and to high And sublime Ends, and therefore as is due, The nobler they become the wider his Sway too! 38. Oh! Man, then seek not to be pointed out By the World's Finger, for all that is so Is monstrous or unhappy, let its Shout Intoxicate thee not: build thou below On the firm Ground of Nature: there is no Foundation for true Greatness like to this: Thus will thy Works, like hers, be lasting, grow A Portion of herself: for all that is True to its End can its best Greatness never miss! 39. But wouldst thou be the greatest of thy Kind Then make thyself its Servant, for the more Thou art a Man with thy whole Heart and Mind, Yea! even to the kneeling down before The greyhaired Beggar from him to implore A Blessing: even to the feeling Awe, Yea! in the Presence of a common Whore, Or the most Outcast Being Eye e'er saw, So much art thou more godlike, great, and free from Flaw 40. For he who feels what 'tis to be a Man, He will respect Man's Nature, howsoe'er Degtaded it may seem: he only can E'en in the fallen Angel trace, still clear, The godlike Outline: then be quick to hear And serve the meanest of thy kind, for so Since all Things are far more than they appear, And whom it is thou serv'st thou dost not know, Thou mayst assist an Angel, for in Garb as low 41. As the poor Beggar's they oft meet thee here: Yea! such their Form unto the inward Eye If it see right will thro' their Rags appear: And be assured that whosoever by Thy Hand be benefitted, 'tis a high And godlike Being: God Himself! for He In all that lives and breathes is ever nigh: And if thou with Indifference couldst see The poor lame Hound, great would thy Father's Sorrow be! 42. The Mite thy Hand unto the Beggar gave Shall be repay'd: not after that brute kind In which it was bestowed, no! thou shalt have A full Reward! unto thy Heart and Mind, Not to thy Hand, in Feelings sweet and kind- Ly Reminiscence shall it be repayed, And thousandfold: ob! be not then so blind As to deny to aught that lives thine Aid, For thee the Good is done, the Sacrifice is made! 43. And God who in that Beggar begged of you, Repays Earth's Treasures with those of the Sky, And earthly Things with Things divine! so do Thou likewise! repay thou with Charity, Ill will: and Hate with Love: and Treachery With Selfdevotion: even tho' the Snake Thy Bosom warmed to life should at thee fly! For what thou dost, thou dost for Christ's dear Sake, He suffered at the Cross, why not thou at the Stake! 44. And if thou hast thus schooled thy Heart, then thou Art fit to enter into Heaven, nay! Art in it, and dost taste its Joys e'en now: This, this Ambition e'en a Christian may Indulge in: for who on this Stage would play The foremost Part, must make of Sacrifice Enjoyment: of Denial Pleasure: yea! And of the Crown of Thorns Life's highest Prize, For the world hates all than itself more good or wise! 45. It easily forgives what in the Sight Of God is hateful, to obtain thereby Like Freedom unto Sin, but its worst spite Is visited on Virtues which imply A tacit Reprehension stern and high: E'en when the Thunders of such Eloquence As thine, oh Milton! do not terrify: Yet hast thou triomphed, for the Source from whence Thou drew'st thy Strength, was perfect Truth and Innocence! 46. Thy Laurelcrown blooms on, and shall until Transplanted to that happier clime to be Like severed branch united to the tree Of Immortality: for hearts that still, In spite of cold Neglect, Adversity, And unrequited Zeal, ne'er deign to lie Unto their being's noblest End and Aim: That in the service of the Deity Unswerving live and die, scorning all Fame Save that of acting well, thro' every change the same: 47. Unbribed by Interest, unawed by fear, Seeking reward but in the consciousness Of being that they should be: and howe'er Fate mar, with zeal that knows no weariness Working their Maker's Glory, and not less Their fellowcreatures Good: tho' oft it be That the ungrateful herd they would but bless, Turns on and rends them, for it will not see, Tho' Truth should hold the glass, its own deformity! 48. For what they have on Earth they do but hold In trust for him who gives and takes away At his good pleasure: be it health, or gold, The cheering smile of Friends, the Joys that play By homesfireside, that make the gradual gray Of Age sit kindly on the wrinkled brow: The one true heart on which their own can lay Its beating pulse at rest: all these they know Are God's to give and take, and to his will they bow. 49. Shall he not ask his own when it seems Good? Shall he not try his servants ere he place His trust in them? the temper and the mood In which they take the gifts of his high Grace? Is not a heart which earthly thoughts debase An unfit Vessel for celestial things? So think they, else of the Allmighty's face To their nightvisions come no visitings, No harpstouched to high themes, nor passingangel's wings! 50. Such hearts as these are not of common Earth, But fashioned with the best Promethean fire That can etherealize our Clay: their birth Is high and holy, and they must aspire To their first origin: for in the mire Of earthly thoughts and hopes they cannot live: They have no peace until th' intense desire, That o'erinforms its tenement, arrive At its true destination, and for aye they strive 51. To lift their Eaglewings above this low And stinted atmosphere, once more to gain That Amplitude of Ether where they grow Unto the shape of Gods: and when again They stoop to Earth, 'tis with a deep disdain For all the nothingness, the fret and care That fevergnaw Man's heart: and there in pain, Likest disguisÃ«d Angels, will they bear His sinworn semblance: heal his wounds, his sorrows share! 52. Th' Eternal Spirit watches o'er the good And faithful few, who in the narrow way Still undisheartened seek him: in the mood Of holy Contemplation, when Earth's sway Is felt not, with an uncreated ray Of Truth their Souls are gladdened: oft at night, When the World sleeps, they see the future day Dawn in its glory on their weary sight And hear the songs of Angels, and their hearts grow light: 53. Light as the young Leaves that on some fair Tree The early Breath of Spring stirs soft and sweet, Instinct with Freshness and the Boyancy Of a new Being: spite of Scorn, Defeat Itself, and Persecution, they complete Their Mission, for to that they live alone: And tho' the Earth reject them, as is meet: For what is not of it it will not own, Their God still welcomes them unto the Martyrscrown! 54. Oh God! what tho' the sons of men should dare To say that Virtue reaps but grief below, These have not worshipped her, their spirits bear No stamp of her high Presence, they have no Belief in her, and therefore cannot know How with all divine gifts her votaries She can enrich: to her own Nature so Subdue them, that from Life's worst Agonies, Like Gold from out the Flame, their Hearts but purer rise! 55. Oh let not Virtue seek Reward or Fame For what she is; for either she must be False to herself and prostitute her Name By serving God and Mammon, or with free And fearless steps pursue her Destiny, Tho' to a scaffold: looking not to Right Nor Left, but with firm glance fixed on the sky, Calm as if gazing down from its far Height: And ever when most tried the more divine her Light! 56. For what is Virtue if man's fickle breath Can make or mar? a bubble! is her Power So mean, forsooth, that she must stoop beneath The vile yoke of Opinion? deign to lower Her godlike brow to win for one brief hour The spurious Wreath which as in Mockery, The tempting Harlot, Fame, dares offer her, The price of Prostitution, Infamy? She is her own reward or else an empty Lie! 57. Oh! let her seek not for the praise of men; in her uncom prehended Beauty she Must move amid the mass, and allinvain The herd would pierce her veil of mystery With glance profane; in their own majesty And radiance are her features hid, e'en as The middaysun in glory: sindim eye Cannot look on her, spotless doth she pass, And the World leaves on her less stain than breath on Glass! 58. What is the Name of Glory unto her, Opinion's empty bubble, in whose breast Its purest Essence dwells? what outward spur Can motive aught she does? Time is her best, Her sure avenger, for he puts to test All meaner essences and with the dust Remingles them, yet wars not on her blest And serene Being; of all Ills the worst That can befall her, is, to yield to Fame's vain Lust! 59. She may not please the multitude, whose brute And earthward glance sees but the palpable: Worships but that which to its State doth suit; Think ye the mole could bear the Sunlight well, Or that the Nightowl would not sooner dwell In Mists and Darkness than in Truth's Broadday? Think ye that Envy, chained in selfmade Hell, Can love that which he hates? alas! none may The Godlike know but those warmed by a kindred ray! 60. Then ye, Apostles of Humanity, Pass on, and take your labour for your pains, In sublime selfcontentedness still ply Your noble task, and seek no other gains Than the approval of the God who reigns In your own bosoms; if the Harlot, Fame, Tempts ye to her Embraces, but once strains Ye to her breast, then are ye sold to shame, Your divine birthright's bartered for an idle Name! 61. Pass on, pass on, as tho' ye were no more Than the poor daydrudge with earthbended brow To Mammon's service bound, as tho' ye bore No seal of the Divinity: as tho' The voice which soundeth through all times were no More than the Democrat's whose fortune lies In the fool's ear; pass on, for here below On the Worldsstage, not to the good and wise, But to the Jugglers still the crowd awards the prize! 62. Pass on, and when ye hear the People shout And magnify your names, give ye no heed, But think that all this uproar must die out, Like the vain sounds contending billows breed When fickle Winds are for a moment freed, Selfwearied soon, in Time's capacious ear Shall be no longer heard; your Master's meed Is all that ye can earn or hope for here, A crown of thorns, to fit ye for an early Bier! 63. Toil on, toil on, and Angels selves shall bring To ye the bread of Immortality, As unto Christ: with heavenly ministring Console and cheer ye in your agony, If in the hour of temptation by The World ye unseduced remain; toil on! Your Light beneath the Bushel shall not lie: Sow, sow the Waste, 'twill quicken 'neath the Sun, The Lord has blessed your Work, and made it as his own! 64. What tho' amid the Clarion's noisy blast, The warpomp and the panoply of state, Your quiet names be heard not, they outlast The Conqueror's trophies, and defy the hate Of Time and dull Oblivion: if late, Yet sure your triomph comes: a lofty Power And Influence on your Labours still doth wait, Ye from afar shape out the coming hour, And sow the seed of Peace when Faction's tempests loaer! 65. Tho' little at the surface seen among The noisier Elements which struggle there And pass and are forgot, to ye belong The deeper springs which at the centre are Of all life's agitation, whence all fair And blessÃ«d growths are fed; thence silently Wisdom's deep undercurrents ever bear On towards the Ocean of Eternity Their tribute of clear waters, nourished from the sky! 66. Then pass, pass on, content to be forgot By those ye toil for, tho' the statue rise To Undesert and ye be numbered not Among Earth's benefactors; lift your eyes From this dim spot and fix them on the skies, And ye shall see some Angel's radiant wing Sever the darkling clouds, as down he flies, With a long Wake of spherelight, see him bring The crown of Immortality, and triomphing 67. Place it upon your brows; then on in Joy And sublime confidence, faint not nor fear; Let no brute mistrust mingle to alloy This perfect Victory, this bliss as clear And pure from earthly stain as is the tear An Angel sheds above the Sinner's Doom: Let axe, or sword, or stake await ye here, The happy realms ye see e'en thro' Death's Gloom, And a bright Spirit opes the Portals of the tomb! THOUGHTS WRITTEN ON THE LAKE OF GENEVA. 1. Reader, art thou an Englishman in Deed As well as Name? breath'st thou this blessÃ«d Air Of Freedom, not alone in Body freed From palpable Shackles, but from Thralldom far More baneful, that of Soul: for they who wear SelforgÃ«d Chains are basest of the Base: The bodybound may yet in Spirit dare To be what is denied him in Life's Race, The chain may gall his Flesh, but leaves within no Trace 2. Art thou an Englishman? is this dear Land To thee a blessÃ«d Temple where thy Feet Walk as on holy Ground, o'er which the Hand Of the Most-High is stretched: lov'st thou to greet Thy Fellowmen as equals, and to treat Our common Nature as a holy Thing, Holding Contempt, in any Shape, unmeet For a wiseman in others honoring The hidden Powers of Worth which in hisown Heartspring 3. Hast thou done all thou couldst in Word and Deed That what thou hast of Godlike might not lie In thee unfruitful? hast thou cast the Seed On the Highways and Byways, far and nigh, In the good Soil and bad: and to the Sky, Which sends the first and latter Rain of Grace When seemeth best to God's allwatching Eye, Left Harvest and Reward, in thy wise Race Awaiting meekly his good Measure, Time, and Place? 4. If thou hast breathed th' ethereal Atmosphere Of divine Thoughts, of holy Hopes and Fears, Whose fittest Emblem is the Patriot's Bier, The Martyr's last, calm Answer to the Sneers Of those whose Portion thro' all coming Years Is Infamy and Shame, as Glory his: If for the Oppressed, the Fatherless, thy Tears Have ever flowed: if Sacrifice be Bliss, Then art thou Freeman of a nobler State than this! 5. Yea! then thou art a Citizen, by Right Divine, of God's own kingdom! thou art free, For those who in obeying Him delight Enjoy a Freedom which can never be Diminished, nay! the more they serve him the More free they areâfor what does he require Of us?ânaught save that we become as He, And being so, what more can man desire? For he who is like God, is freeâand something higher! 6. He is good also: but the Goodman has No Time to think about Freewill: nay, he Knows not the Word: for were he still free, as The World interprets it, then he might be A Sinner: but that is not to be free, 'Tis but to freely be a Slave! but to Do Good, exalts, ennobles: therefore we When most like God have least Choice, we must do Good, because Godlike, and yet rÃ©main quite free too: 7. Because we do that which we wish alone, Thus to be quite good and quite free are one: And this is the Reward of Goodness: the More we grow good, the more too are we free, For Will and Duty, as we better grow, Become synonimous: until to know And wish that which is Right are one same Thing: So wonderful can God together bring Things adverse, and most perfect Freedom draw From the most strict Observance of his Law! 8. And when most good, then lightest doth it lie Upon us: yea! like Gossamer: for we Being godlike ourselves, most easily Fulfill the godlike Law: nay! there can be None other, as for God too up on high! Then, Reader, if thou bear'st that Law with Pain, Thou art not Godlike, thou must learn again: Be thou thy self the Law, and this thou best Wilt be by being godlike: all the Rest Will follow of itself, without this all is vain! 9. Hast thou kept pure, 'mid Life's Impurities, And calm, amid its Fever and Unrest, The Heart within thee, deeming that the best Of all the Blessings which this Life supplies: The kernel of the Fruit and its chief Zest: The End and the Beginning of the rest! If thou hast kept therein a Nook of still And healthy Feelings, then on Nature's Breast With its deep Calmness thou thine own canst fill: Her converse soothes the Mind, and purifies the Will. 10. 'Tis from our own Hearts we must breathe the Spell Over this weekday Earth, 'till then so bare And cold in Semblance: and thenceforth we dwell In this our selfcreated Eden, where All Sights and Sounds a nobler Import bear, And the least Flowers from the Grass that start As in a reflex Exaltation share: For God is felt in all, in every Part, Pulsing harmonious, one universal Heart! 11. Then first a thousand scattered Thoughts we bind In one intense Conception, as may flow The sunkissed Icedrops into one combined. A thousand Feelings, which we did not know The Force of well, because dismembered, throw Their Blood into one Heart, one Feeling high Of God: nay! God himself, for it is so He enters into us: then to our Eye Nature's vast Heart is bared, and audibly We hear it beat with ours in Weal or Woe, And feeling with each Part one with the Whole we grow! 12. 'Tis this which makes God, God! his Sympathy With all Things, e'en the least, the Worm or Fly. The more thou feel'st with all Things then, how low, How mean soe'er they seem, the more will thy Heart be like His in its Immensity! Like the Seasands, which, tho' one mighty Whole, Are made up of such an Infinity Of least, least Parts, so does God's Heart comprize The infinitely Vast and Littleâ Skies, And Ocean rolling on from Pole to Pole, The Glowworm and the starry Galaxy: Heart of all Hearts, and Soul of every Soul, The godlike Eye in Man, and in the purblind Mole! 13. Oh! wondrous is He, Glory to his Name: More during than the Mountains are his Ways! His Statutes everfaultless and the same, Like the blue Firmament, where to his Praise The Morningstar, with each Daysdawn, doth raise His Hymn of Jubilee: still pealing on From Star to Star thro' all the endless Maze, 'Till she of Eve exultant lifts anon Her Voice, nor sleeps the Hymn 'till caught up by the Sun! 14. Shall we alone be silent then, we men, To whom God gives e'en his own Spirit, his Divine Intelligence? shall Poet's Pen Kindle to Rapture on all Themes but this? When e'en the Silence of the Flower is More eloquent than Words, shall Man alone Be in this universal Hymn of Bliss Unheard, as if to him God were unknown, As if in this wide World he saw naught but his own 15. Vain Works, and not his Maker's? let my Voice Then sing of thee, oh Father! let me here Kneel and call on all Nature to rejoice, Until the gathering Hymn grows strong and clear Filling the wide, wide World; while I mine ear Apply thereto, as to the Seashell, no Longer one Man whose feeble Organs hear A few, faint Notes, but the full, sublime Flow Pour'd as on Mankind's Ear, whose Substitute I grow, 16. Sublimed and giantized by Faith unto That Stature: in my Person see Mankind Kneel down before thee, Father! in thy true, Thy one true Temple! man would have confined Thee in four Walls, by Foot and Rule designed, For being small himself he made thee so. But now the one true Man seeks for his Mind, Not for his Body, a fit Shrineâand lo! The eternal Dome is reared, the Stars its Wonders show! 17. No more as in the old Basilicas The great Greek Cross, but mute and lifeless, o'er Me spreads its Arms, lit by the Tapersrays, While hushed and awestruck Crowds kneel down before The lowbent Face: the Image is no more: The living God himself is in its Stead! And from the Temple's Depths, still as of yore, The divine Form bends down with Arms outspread. With Mercy's widespread Arms, alike o'er Quick and Dead 18. I ask no fabled Muse to aid my Song Or lift its feeble Wing above these low And grovelling Cares of Earth; to such belong No heavenly Gifts: the vaunted Wreaths that grow On Helicon, and braid the Poetsbrow, Are fleeting as Man's Breath, and withered fall To their own Dust! but thine, thine are not so, Oh Truth! One Leaf of thine is worth them all, These fail us, but on thee in vain we never call! 19. Oh! were it mine to pluck the meanest Leaf Of that true Growth, and weave it with my Lay, Unfading Eyergreen, to grace the brief Garland of idle Fancy: one calm Ray Of thy true Inspiration 'mid the Play Of earthlier Thoughts: alas! the Paths of Fame Are steep and slippery, nor rashly may Her Heights be trod, and least by Foot so lame; Man's Hopes are hasty Climbers, and oft come to Shame! 20. Yet let my humble Wreath be what it may, No Flower plucked by wanton Pleasnre there Shall breathe seductive Poison: tho' my Lay Above this nether Atmosphere scarce dare To lift a flagging Wing, yet still the Air It breathes shall not polluteânor shall it trail, Snakelike, its grovelling Folds, or meanly bear Venom amid its Baseness. Truth, then hail Once more: on thy strong Arm I lean, that will not fail! 21. For ne'er will Poesy her Brightness deign To veil within the cloudy Tabernacle Where thy Light shines not clear: her chosen Fane, Like thine too, is the upright Heart; ye dwell Together, are evoked by one same Spell, Both Twins of Nature, to his Service true, From whose due Praise, as from best Oracle, His Inspiration every Poet drew Who ever felt his Heart filled and sublimed by you. 22. So fill ye mine, and cleanse it from all Dross, That inharmonious Mixture none may be, Nor unfit Recollections ever cross, Like a jarred String, the divine Harmony By quiring Angels sung. Oh set me free: Open mine Ear unto their Hymn of Love, That as the bright Spheres towards Eternity, By that so sweet Compulsion tunÃ«d, move, So may my Heart be tuned, and drawn to wards Him above! 23. The Sun is sinking 'neath yon' towering Height That climbs so proudly o'er the Giantmaze Of Mountains, and with unconsuming Light Kindles the Summit, where his scattered Rays Seem gathered on Earth's Altar in a Blaze Of Eveningsacrifice; the Clouds above, That curl up with a golden, vapoury Haze, Like a rich Incense thro' the Heavens move, As tho' Earth's countless Tribes adored the God of Love! 24. Methinks I hear o'er Valley and Hillside The manyvoicÃ«d Hymn, which, as it flies Onward, draws into its own airy Tide A thousand Streams of Prayer: around me rise Soft Whispers, 'tis Earth's Commune with the Skies! Her Fairy forms are forth, like Dreams they flit, Scarceseen amid the Dusk, before my Eyes, By Twilight's dieing Smile but faintly lit, While Darkness plumes their Wings, and on each Leaf doth sit! 25. 'Tis as if all the multitudinous Waves, Those Voices of the solemn Deep, that flow Beneath so many Climes, from all their Caves, Their thousand Shores and hidden Depths below, Were borne in sweeping Murmurs, soft and low, Like thousand sweet aÃ«rial Harpings blent In one still Harmony, untill they grow Subdued and faint, in voiceless Echoes spent. No Words are syllabled to tell what's meant: 'Tis the Heart's Cypher, for the Vast, th' Unknown, Th' Unspeakable, which can be felt alone! 26. Oh! in its Depths what rich Ores unworked lie, Truth's precious Ores, which should be coined and beat God's Form and Superscription; yet these by Man are regarded as beneath his Care: Thus still in Life the noblest has least Share. Alas! 'tis Coin scarcecurrent in this Sphere, And mixed with base Alloyâthe Few who dare To pass it unadulterated hear Their Names a By word, and their Laurels poision bear! 27. Vile Slaves of Mammon drudging in the Mine, Ye sabbathless cold Hearts that never know Brief Respite from accursÃ«d Toil, what Shrine Do ye bow down before or what Seed sow? Is it not sown in Sin, and reaped in Woe? As Nightshade must bear Poison, this must be Your Harvest! bend your Necks to him, then go And call yourselves the Â«Reasoning, the Free;Â» The bitterest Satire is unfelt Self mockery! 28. Oh ye that wring from Blood, and Sweat, and Tears The wages of Iniquity, beware Lest on your Heads the sureavenging Years (Who from the dark Past to the Future bear The Balance due to Justice,) blank Despair And heartsick Anguish heap. Oh take ye heed; Ere yet it be too late the Ills repair Which ye have caused: let Mercy no more bleed To see your Works, lest she disown ye in your Need! 29. The Joys of Earth are like the Flames that glide Wan, flickering, across the vapoury Swamp, Mocking the sight, and ever ill betide To the unheedful Step, which by such Lamp Would guide its unsure Footing o'er the damp Aud treacherous Soilâtheir very Light dim, gross, And earthy as its originâno Stamp Of God's high Image can on Earth's vile Dross Be left, of which the more we have the more our Loss. 30. The panting Child, all Sense and Sight, pursues The golden Bee that like a stray Sunbeam Sparkles among the rainbowglancing Hues Of the young Springâit lightsâthe promised Dream Of Pleasure makes his glad Eye brighter gleam, And beat his little Heartâthro' all the Bower The Bee has led the chace, as it might seem From very Spiteâ the Child now grasps the Flower. But feels Pain's hidden sting dash ripe Joy's fanceied Hour. 31. E'en such an idle Chace is that of Man Clutching the unsubstantial Form of some Cloudwove Enjoymentâ as if in the Span Of daily Life the Fool could not find Room Enough betwixt the Cradle and the Tomb From his own human Heart to draw real Bliss, Instead of vapoury Happiness like this! Ixion's fancied Joys, which take the Bloom Of Beauty and the Shape of Truth, and kiss The thirsting Lip, then turn in mockery To empty Air; the Heart left voidâits Hopesâ a Sigh: 32. And is not Man an o'ergrown Child, more fond And foolish than his Prototypeâa vain Dreamer of empty Dreamsâ his Life a Sound? A few, brief Accents voiced in Joy or Pain, That with Time's everpealing Tone again Mingle as if they were not, and pass on Lost in that solemn Sound, which, like the Main When whisper all his waves in Unison, Sweeps ever deep not loudâ'till itself be Gulfed, as it gulfs the Past, within Eternity. 33. Eyes hath he yet ne'er uses them to view Things in themselves or as they ought to be: Like one who thro' an Atmosphere untrue Looks pleased with the Deceitâ so his Sight he Distorts and twists, the better thus to see Prankt Error's uncouth Shapes, when Reason's Mask The Motley wears, and grins in apish Glee At her mad Train, who ply the Danaid's Task; Pluckers of Thorns, who Flowers fling away, Seekers in Dark of Light they cannot find by Day! 34. Poor worm! he scarcely crawls from out the Farth, And from his Eyes a little Dust doth fling, But straight he'd soar an Eagle, of his Birth And Sphere forgetfulâ with the feeble wing Of his still unfledged Intellect, this Thing, This warring Union of Nothingness And Pride, would be of Elements sole king; Himself a solveless Riddle, not the less The Riddle of the Universe he'll solve, Seat Chance upon God's Throne, and Heaven in Air dissolve! 35. Peoples he not the blessed Broaddaylight With Mockeries far more idle and more vain Than Childhood's credulous Eye shapes forth at Night, Fooled by wild Fancies? Phantoms of the Brain, Tempting with unreal Joy, or with real Pain Vexing the tortured Heart, which leave it worn, And palled, and jaded, never fit again For simple Pleasures, which in hardened Seorn, (Sin's worst yet fittest Punishment,) the Taste Perverted spurns and barters Eden for a Waste! 36. Oh! God, let me not think on these dark Things, Which o'er the Brightness of my Spirit throw Their shadows dim and chill; still Nature flings Her Smile o'er all, still to her Breast we go, For she is aye the same, nor deigns to know The Fret and Fever of Man's Life. She ne'er Thy Image has defaced: Creation's Glow Of Beauty lingers on her Brow so clear, And in her mighty Breast the Heart is never sere! 37. And here she woos me with her sweetest Smile To happier Fancies, and the Scene around May banish from quick Memory awhile Her busy Recollectionsâscarce a Sound Floats on the stilly Air, or o'er the Ground Creeps silentlyâafar, the Vesperbell Mingles with everpealing Time, profound And solemn, whose vast Clock, this World, doth tell Man's Course and Nature's, and the Changes rings so well! 38. It seems to catch its Tone from 'yon lone Star, Which thro' the paly Blue of Heaven, on Th' Horizon just now rising, gleams afar: An earthly Echo of its higher Tone, The Hymn it sings to God, yet still but one Same Meaning speaks in both, in that bright Sky, And this dim Earth; one string is touched alone Of Nature's mighty Harp, alike felt by Man's small Heart here below, and God's vast Heart on high! 39. Seest thou that faintlyraying Star? it gleams Like modest worth, in sober privacy Of the far western heavens: its soft beams Oft shun th' incurious glance, to bless the Eye And heart on which it shines an emblem high Of holiest thoughts; and tho' its glowworm Light Scarce twinkle 'mid the gorgeous canopy Of the downsteering sunclouds, which in bright And wavy flow the sunswake track, we feel That holier charms still grace that star in woe and weal. 40. Hail holiest star! star of the Heart and Home! That kindles on the Hearth the welcome blaze Where fond ones meet again, while those who roam Think on the gladsome looks of early days That made Homesthreshold bright as Paradise, And blent its memory with our hopes of Heaven, Of which it is a type; thy welcome rays Speak respite to daystoil, in mercy given: 'Tis thine to light the peasant to his cot, Birds to their dewy nest, what sweet thoughts wak'st thou not? 41. Mine Eye is glancing o'er this varied scene, Seeking some hidden Link, more home to bring Unto the fond and yearning heart the sheen Of palpable and outward forms, and fling Its own electric chain o'er everything. For the full Heart delights to hue the Earth With its own colors: not a Bird can sing But it must play Interpreter: no mirth Is sweet save of its Hallowing, and tame All seems, 'till Nature's Torch be lit at Love's pure flame 42. Nor long, nor vainly seek I; for e'en there, There 'neath 'yon aged chestnuttrees, that seem To stoop in benedictions o'er the fair And early flowers at their feet, I deem That modest merit dwells: a gurgling stream, Pure as the simple hearts of those who drink Its waters unrepining, with bright gleam Is glancing past, while on the mossy brink A group of youngeyed things, like flowers that grow From the same parentstem, are murmuring soft and low, 43. Angels not disinherited! by care And worldly guile untainted; in whose Eyes, Those Eyes that shrink not back in conscious fear, We see the loveborn thoughts alternate rise In visible beauty, and the heart's fresh dies Clearmirrored, like the pebbles in a stream. Oh what unconcious Joy within them lies, The atmosphere of their young Hearts: they seem Too beautiful for grief; alas! Earth's weal Is gnawed by Memory's tooth, which young souls do not feel! 44. There on the threshold of her Streamsidecot Stands she, their mother, for those Eyes of Love, Of deep unutterable Love, felt not On Earth by other than a Mother, prove Her such; but tho' the Heart within her move With fullfraught Rapture, as she gazes on Her little ones, and looks from them above, Yet a slight shade of care at times will run O'er the halflaughing Eye: some idle fear, Coined in affection's forge, halfwakes the latent tear, 45. She but halffeels the glorious Eve that dies Amid a thousand changing hues of Light, Grace, Splendor, Beauty, blent athwart the skies; As tho' the Lord of Hosts passed in his might, And at each step a thousand rainbows bright Had paved his path with glories; no, she pants For him who is the apple of her sight, Her Being's spell, whose presence all her wants And wishes calms, who brings to her void heart The Evening's absent Charm, his Voice its sweetest Part. 46. And when the coming step with Love's quick Ear She catches on the wind, how bright her Eye Sparkles with modest Joy, and each fond fear Turns to a smile, when once again he's nigh. Oh tis a pleasant sight, and tho' we sigh In our heartloneliness, yet still it pours On us the Blessedness of memory, And lifts from selfish fears: for who some stores, Some Heritage has not, some thoughts of home, Nor seeks that polestar of the Heart wheree'er he roam? 47. Who has not some sweet tie to bind to Earth And link him to his kind? who does not bear Some holy name of Love? in whom does worth Like this, alas! too oft o'erlooked, too rare, Not wake some kindred sympathies, some share Of gentler thoughts? tho' not for self t' may be, Yet still for others: nay, e'en those who are Cut off from kindly sympathies may see With something more than casual glance a scene Which hallows thus our common Nature's colder mien. 48. How glorious dies out the closing Day, An Heaven dissolved in beauty! the far west Glows conscious of the Daygod, whose last ray, Like Love's own Partingglance, wakes in the breast A deeper, holier warmth. As to their nest Our scattered Daythoughts gathering stilly, seek The spirit's brooding wings, where soothing rest Fits them for holy musings: the Clouds break Like golden billows on the Mountainsbrows, As tho' their molten Tints had fused th' eternal snows, 49. Where Beauty sits enthralled, fair e'en in Death, Tho' cold and chilly, till the Partingray Kindles some latent Lifespark lurking neath Her icepale Brow: how varied is the play Of thousand shifting Lights that wing their way, Streaming from off the sunclouds, till the scene Glows with the hues of heaven, and we lay Aside our earthliness, as we had been Recalled unto the mighty Whole, like those Bright sunbeams by the Sun, now sinking to Repose? 50. With each new shade familiar objects seem Touched with a solemn charm: the Heavens brood On the Earth's bosom, 'till her features beam With angelbeauty, as in solemn mood, Some prayeruplifted face a dazzling flood Of Inspiration kindles, 'till the soul Flashes forth in each Line; from stream and wood, From valley, crag and hill, the bright hues roll In ebbing beauty off: still scattered streaks, Like the last tremblings of a smile, light up their peaks. 51. Yet still a Partingglory lingers bright On yon grey Villagesteeple, as it were To sanctify the spot: as tho' that Light The hallowed feelings of the place could share, And felt its spell: but 'tis no longer there, Heaven hath claimed its own, and Twilight gray Mantles the Earth; e'en thus Hope's hues so fair Light up some distant object, life's long way Beguiling: on we speed, but near the spot The light has fled, the Churchyard still remains our Lot! 52. Thou bright Midmountainlake, thou glorious Glass! Alpgirdled-mirror, giving back the forms Of endless Loveliness: of Clouds that pass In sunsetglory steeped: of Thunderstorms, That fireflashing robe with aweful charms The cloudcompelling heights, and o'er thee fling A Spiritpresence, like that which informs The human breast, as tho' a living thing Thou sportedst with the storm and kissed his passing wing. 53. How beautiful is thy bright Lake, Leman, Yet fairest now, when Evening's gentle hand Hath robed thee in her quiet Sheen: when fan Thy brow night's earliest dewbreath'd zephyrs, and Thy waters seem a mirror which the strand Girdles, as 'twere a Preciousgem, with all The shapes and hues of beauty: from the Land Soft murmurs float across thy breast, and call From shore to shore in welcome, or slow glides Some whitesailed bark, spritelike, upon thy darkening tides, 54. Which spread so calmly still, so softly bright Beneath the sateless and enraptured eye That we scarce feel of Earth, or deem the sight A mortal vision: mark how silently The azure hues are deepening in the sky, And on the wave the twinkling star appears, Glowing with dim and holy brilliancy, Like Love's fond Eye thro' softexhaling tears, To clamer beauty soothed, and freed from recent fears. 55. And the glad Mountains, pile on pile afar, Seem pillars where the azure heavens rest Their arching canopy, which each bright star Crests as it rises: where the eagles nest In glorious privacy of snows, and breast With stormnursed wing the mighty Whirlwindsshock That wakes the thundering Snowfall: not the least Among thy mountainwonders; on yon' Rock Mark the surefooted Chamois's fearful Leap, Hark! his soft Voice has broke the frozen Echo's sleep. 56. Trace yon' ancestral Chesnutwood, that climbs O'er rocky Meillerie, and clothes her sides With forestglooms: how bold their Giantarms Are flung abroad in Air! with frequent strides They seem to scale the heights, and in the tides That murmur at their feet, their ranks are seen Brightglassed; how Nature in her forms abides Alltimeunchanged, from the least blade of green That clothes the wavekissed bank, to yon' tall Alp's snowsheen! 57. She changes ever, yet is still the same, In her own Essence beautiful and free From sere decay; Time has not, cannot tame One Joypulse of her heart, nor bid her be Other than what she is eternally, And was, and shall be 'till Earth pass away. The Autumnleaves fall sere from the ripe tree, Not premature, but in their destined Day Earthblent: once more in sunshine on the bough to play! 58. Oh lovely, lovely are thy works, great God, Which in their full perfection witness bear To thy worldgrasping Wisdom; the least sod Is wonderfraught, and every passing air, Loud-or softvoiced, speaks with one ever clear And soulfelt revelation unto those Who pierce these outward forms, (which far and near Are varying types of one sole Truth, that throws Its light o'er all things,) and in Nature's faith repose! 59. The Eye is drunk with wonder and scarce knows Where next to bend its glance, but like the bee Lost in a Bed of all sweet flowers, grows Fastidious from surfeit: what can be Fairer than Clarens, with its Mimicsea Of evervarying beauty, for we find A Charm in those bright waters, and their glee Is like a blue Eye's glancing, which doth bind As with a Touch of human Sympathy The scene unto our hearts and hopes; it is A fairyspot might realize Love's dream of bliss. 60. Bosomed in yon still nook, where woody Hills Smile greenly down on its bright Paradise, Earth's Eden, which the kindled fancy fills With beings pure as are the fresh blue skies Above: for there a gem enshrined it lies, So quiet, calm, and happy, that one deems Mere worldly thoughts profanity: our Eyes Grow spellbound to the spot, which has, meseems, A Sky, a World, a Beauty of its own, Where the heart dreams of things to man's dark Life unknown. 61. Oh it imparts a feeling soft, a glow Of holiest calm to wearied souls, to those Whom Life has made Inheritors of woe Their own or others: here awhile they lose The Consciousness of self, and in them grows A Cheerfulness, if not of mirth, yet still A Reflexglow of happiness which throws Its sunsetlight upon them: here they fill Their hearts with Nature, and she with her brings As surely Peace, as in the Sun the Flower springs! 62. Man's hand no rude Invader has been here In Nature's quiet Realms: his traees seem, So gently are they blent by time, as 'twere A part of her primeval self, of stream, Of rock, and wood and fell, a waking dream, Which, with a pure and quiet heart to be Its centrespirit, focus ef each beam Of outward beauty, might abundantly Yield us all bliss that Mau can taste beneath the sky. 63. Time works strange changes; with his silent wand, Mighty Magician! touching all things here, He alters and transforms them: Man's vain hand Piles up its haughty monuments, the year, Revolving at Time's beck, doth strew and wear His glories into Dust: unresting foe, With noiseless Tooth he gnaws, and everywhere Fastcrumbling fragments witness as we go, How 'neath his step all things, save Virtue, are laid low! 64. The vulgar Mind, that with the bodyseye Judges of Powers, and at Home alone Amid these palpable forms, still measures by Sinew and Muscle all it looks upon: Knowing no other standard 'neath the Sun Than the ellwand of brute reality. And in these stonebuilt piles, ere Time has spun His Cobwebs mocking round their walls so high, Deems that it sees a strength beyond his enmity. 65. But yet awhile! a few steps to the Tomb, And the Owlswing shall brush the dust away From the proud Portals where the Warriorsplume But late was waving, and the sunny ray Be broken by the Ivywreaths that play Round the worn Windows with the summerair: And in the Halls the unscared Toad shall stray, Trailing his Slime where erst the proud and fair, Now but forgotten Dust, in revel would repair! 66. And this is trength! aye 'tis the strength of Earth, And Time upon its nothingness doth lay His withering hand revealing its true worth: His unseen hand, whose Touch is soft as may Be a fair Lady's in her silken play, Yet far, far harder than thricefurnaced Steel, And sharperedged, whose stroke wears not away: And irremoveable, tho' we scarce feel Its weight while on our heads the Grey of age doth steal! 67. He lays his hand on all things. Hall and Tower He crumbles into dust: he brings and bears Away our hopes, yet brings not back the hour That's flown unto our fretfulthoughted Prayers. He travels at our side and with us shares Evil and Good, and laughs inaudibly When he beholds us bowed to Earth by cares For fleeting Bubbles bursting 'neath our Eye, And sacrificing to himself Eternity! 68. He alters and perfects the Tongues of Men Better than Schools and learned Academies, Erasing from them with his Ironpen The crude additions which the misnamed wise Would substitute for his sure Remedies: Enlarging Man's ideas, he puts Man's speech Upon a level with them; still he plies His mighty task, and silently doth preach, Making sage comment on all things within his reach! 69. Impartial Ministrant of Heavensgifts, On kings and beggars he bestows the same Amount of life's true wealth: alike he sifts The Heart that beats 'neath silk or rags; to shame He brings Pride's haughty counsels, and can tame The stiffest neck unto his galling yoke. He can consolidate or rend the frame Of mightiest Empires, and with the stroke Of his light hand Rome's proud Colossus built and broke. 70. Hurling it to the Dust from whence it rose, With a worldrending shock: a sound whereby The Nations were struck dumb, as at the close Of some voicehushing, aweful tragedy, The world its ample stage, Humanity Itself spectator! such scenes Time displays: Time, the Philosopher, whose searching Eye Measures of human Life the mighty Maze, And at the end awards impartial Blame or Praise. 71. Himself the mightiest of Poets here, Judge, Critic, and Philosopher, as none Have been before or since: he has an ear Of Mechanism exquisite: no tone But he, ere by the envious Winds 'tis blown Away, will catch: and if from Truth's sweet tongue The accents fall, he keeps and makes them known, Early or late: still severing Right from Wrong, That Rubicon which none can pass unpunished long! 72. Let no rash Lip the Alljust Giver blame, For pondering heedfully Life's plan, we see That in Time's treasure all are rich the same: In things which to Salvation needful be, And to our wellfare here, all Men are free To take as large a share as suits their needs, The beggar as the king ungrudgedly: Truth, Love, Hope, Wisdom, Joy, to selfish Creeds And Place are bounded not, but wait on our own Deeds. 73. And Time, the only treasure we can bear Thro' the grave's narrow pass, is all our own, When coined into gooddeeds that perish ne'er, For then he is a nobler Essence grown: By our own act the moment, ere 'tis flown, Is snatched from Time and made Eternity. Such power unto the soul belongs alone, Being itself eterne it has thereby A Priviledge to make eterne what else must die. 74. Time frames our Cradle and our Coffin too: He rears us up to manhood, and 'tis he Who with the Sexton's palsied hand and hue Of weatherbeaten cheek rings out the glee Of Marriagebells, the soberer harmony Of those which call the soul from Earth away, Tuned ill to such a Hope: and tho' they be More solemn, yet, methinks, 'twere hard to say Why we should not rejoice, the more our heads grow gray! 75. But the frail flesh obtrudes its idle fears On the soul's sympathy, and thus our Eyes, When we should most rejoice, are dimmed by tears. For we must feel, howe'er Time tests and tries All meaner Essences beneath the skies, Dustmingling them, that in our souls we have That which he gave not, and which therefore dies Not when he summons flesh unto its grave: Then let the Grass grow, and the Flowers on it wave! 76. Time is our friend, then let him do his worst, He wars not on our souls, but with the base And outward forms in which fools put their trust; Then let his mighty wing in scorn efface Man's Pride and Nothingness, and leave no trace Of all the Follies that he sees arise And disappear, like bubbles, from their place: Fearless Faith looks beyond the Form that dies, And from her steady glance all Doubt and Terror flies! 77. While all seems Chance and Change and idle Noise, There's that which changes not eternally: An evergushing fountain of Lifejoys Still pouring down unto us from on high; The bright Castalian Fount of Poesy, Of Love, Truth, Freedom, Life, upspringing 'neath A purer than the Greek's songfabled sky, And from a higher source: and they who breathe That sky, and drink that fount shall never taste of Death! 78. Time who is everywhere, here too has been Busy in Desolation, yet with sweet And hallowing Presence has he touched this scene, Where grey Tradition with her stumbling feet, Halting and lame, has left each mossy seat, Each woodgirt cliff and glade, some Snatches here And there of her old songs, that fade fullfleet In broken Echoes, yet caught by the Ear To Nature true, 'mid these old choral Rocks still clear. 79. Here labours he in his own holy task, To Nature giving back what man of yore Had robbed from her materials, which ask His gentle hand, his alltransforming power, From them t'efface the traces of that hour Which from her holy breast, from antique Peace, And Quietness, and genial Uses tore Her Elements, that man profaning these Against her Will to Strife, might work wild Phantasies, 80. Marring with uncouth Shapes her quiet reign, And warring with Creation's Harmony: But Time has given back to thee again, Sweet Nature! thy own rights, and holily Thou takest back unto thy Self, to high And fitter purpose hallowing, thine own Abused materials: for with pleased Eye We see the Wildflowers on the wall have grown, And with their summerbreath we feel that thou hast thrown 81. Over this timeworn building, now once more A part of thee, the spell of thy most sweet And holy calm, as in the days of yore: Thus thy old castle, Chillon! once the seat Of Tyranny, has Time, who changes fleet, Shaking the dust of ages from his wings On thy stern walls, transformed into a meet And most apt type of Peace: thus adverse things He reconciles, for in his wild Imaginings 82. He is the boldestfancyed Poet still. And dear to Nature and Humanity Are these grey Walls, where once the freeborn will Allusion to Bonnivard, imprisoned 6 years in Chillondungeon.Of one who would not bow to aught less high, Waged, in the consciousness of worth and by Endurance which was conquest, war with those Who fight with Nerve and Steel. Poor Fools! the Eye May dim, the limbs be palsied, but to Throes Like these mankind its noblest Inspirations owes! 83. And in such spots as this, by human sufferings Made holy, dwells a Beauty and a Power, A Spirit hovering on viewless wings: A Presence felt more palpably, before Whose formless Being we do feel as our Own inmost soul were blent with it, like Air Mingling with Air: as tho' the flesh no more Lay on us, but setfree in spirit there, Our souls with that same universal Soul did share! 84. Timehallowed objects, and the ruins which With Age grow Types of hoar Antiquity, To the Pastworshipper's Backglance are rich With Hauntings of old days, and Imagery Of Fancy: but Hope's clear prophetic Eye To that which one sole charm of Time ne'er wore The Beauty of a far Futurity Imparts, and with some touch of Memory's power By bold o'erleaping Time invests the passing hour! 85. Here on these Mountainheights, aloof from Earth, We breathe the Eaglesair, if with his wing We cannot soar: all Forms that here have birth Are Nature's freeborn burghers, not a thing Is here artfettered, from the birds that sing On their hoar boughts to these old Trees that wed Their snakeliketwisted Limbs, and downward fling A chequered shade, halfsunproof, on the bed Of tangled moss and woodflowers wild on which wetread. 86. And ever and anon, between the Boughs By the Winds kissed asunder, on our View Breaks the brightlaughing Lake, which gently throws Its manytwinkling Waves of chrystal Blue With Silversplash upon the Shore, whose Hue Is vinegreen down unto the Watersbrink. And ever as the varying Breezes woo The Lake's Breast, blent the Mountainshadows sink. Again in its clear Glass to knit each broken Link! 87. Oh! here we grow in Spirit like the Forms Spread round us, Forms so grand and simple: Streams. Woods, Glens, and Mountains, where the Thunderstorms On cloudwing brood: round which the Lightning gleams With Flamewreaths, 'till from Earth each tall Peak seems A Firecolumn towering thro' the Sky. All here of Eye and Ear with Beauty teems, The windborne Cataract's voice seems thundering nigh, To which the Mountainechoes as in Joy reply. 88. Here would I dwell, and make my careless Heart E'en as a Mountainecho, fresh and clear, Of natural Sounds alone: I would impart My Feelings to dead Things, and make them bear Me Company: to my attunÃ«d Ear The Winds should not be meaningless: each Sound And Midhillvoice should wake a holy Fear, As tho' the Universal Pan around, The World's undying Soul, spoke from the awestruck Ground! 89. And I would have sweet Revelations Of hidden Things, unseen of vulgar Sight, The Mountainnymphs should visit me, the Stones, By a far greater than Orphean Might, Should stir to Lifeâ with Flashings forth of Light The Faith of olden Times should quicken me, And gray Romance, not fabled, but allbright In pristine Forms, teach in each Rock to see A dearthless Pegasean Fount of Poesy! 90. And why may I not deem that in Midair A Spiritworld exists? because the Eye Beholds it not, because to sense not bare? And is this Reason?â has Infinity Such narrow Limits that we must deny All that we cannot touch! can He then who Made Sight, not frame an higher Faculty? Who formed the Soul, not fashion spirits too? Who made the World, want other Forms to pass into? 91. What wouldst thou make then of the Deity? An Axiom in Physics, to prepare Some little Theory of Things, as thy Brains piece them out: to solve that which they are Not capable of grasping: wilt thou dare To measure God by Man? to draw a Line, And say, Â«thus far, no farther come!Â» what were God's Wisdom if his Ways thou couldst define? A Page of Euclid, or an Algebraic Sign! 92. Can He who joined the Body and the Soul Not part them too? can He who is alone All Things, each Part, and yet at once the Whole, Not be us in a Mode more like his own? Enough for thee: that if thy Soul has grown Like Him within, by working in this Sphere The Godlike, in whatever Form unknown, Elsewhere, thou couldst not draw to Him more near. Nor yet be more sublimely like, than thus and here! 93. And what were Faith, if in the Boundlessness Of such Beliefs her Wings she could not spread? Let Doubt toil on with heavy Feet and press The vile Dust which the Grave heaps on his Head; But let not Faith with him be forced to tread This narrow Round of earthly Fear and Care. The Birds have wings, and we too in their stead Have Thoughts, Imagination's Wings, to bear Us where we chuse, then think! and thou art free as Air! 94. How ill that proud, cold Wisdom, which is taught By Disappointment and by Time, supplies The Child's wide Faith; which resting firm on naught, Would measure even God's high Mysteries By Fact's Ellwand: much further Childhood's Eyes See than Philosophyâ not yet is rent The Link that binds our Spirit to the Skies, But doublesighted, we can see Earth blent With Heaven, and Light from one across the other sent! 95. Yes! we are priviledged in Youth's bright Day To see and hear the Shapes and Sounds of Heaven, And Angelshands oft roll the Clouds away That mantle o'er the golden Gates of Even, And visioned Glories to our Sight are given, Seen with the Body's Eye, but not by it; But when with Sin's dark Shadow we have striven, Our sense grows dim, and mourning we must sit In Dust and Darkness, by that Light no longer lit! 96. It is the divine Hand of Faith alone, (And thus holds good the antique Prophecy, Engrayed at Sais At Sais in Egypt was the Stone-statue of Isis, With a large and outspread Stoneveil thrown over it, bearing this Inscription. Â«I am all that was, is and will be here, my veil has no Mortal raised.Â» on the mystic Stone,) Can Nature's Isis-veil uplift, whereby The mighty Mother's hidden: to her Eye Alone it grows transparent, and we view The Form colossal in its Majesty, The mighty Heart for ever beating thro' The Breast, transparent made, sogodlike, calm, and true 97. Then straight into the Beauty chain that binds Th' entire Earth, linklike, our Souls are knit, As in sweet Song a true Note straightway finds His sweet Companion, and as one they fit. Thus of th' electric chain each Link in it Feels with the whole, and as the whole may be. And where-or howso-ever lightly hit, Tho' but the Heart's least Beat, it vibrates free To God's own Heart, whose Hand holds it invisibly! 98. The Soul, the eternal Soul, which on this Frame Shines for awhile, as does the bright Sunbeam Upon the Clod, and then to whence it came, Its Skyabode, remounts, can pour a stream Of Radiance on all Forms, until they seem Transfigured and sublimed, in its own Ray. 'Till this Reality be as a Dream, A fleeting Dream on the eternal way, Which from the Spring head world the Soul pursues for aye! 99. Oh Heaven must have Joys which Eye has not Seen nor Imagination dreamt, else why This Yearning ever for some happier Lot, This Want which naught on Earth appeases, by Which we infer our capability For such a Being? naught is given to One living Thing in vain: no Faculty Left idle; thus this Longing will come true, Will someday find its sphere, and work out its End too! 100. It is no vain Beliefâit springs alone From Being's primal Depths; is prompted too By Nature's self, who in us gives her own Belief an Utterance: what all men thro' All Times think, must, to be believed, be true; It cant be thus by Accident, for no Belief so uniformly could renew Itself by Chance: to fixed Laws it must owe Its origin, from something permanent must flow. 101. It must be then essential unto Man, Springs from his Nature indispensably, As from the Rose its Perfume; then he can Thro' this Faith only be a true Man, by Believing in a Godlike Destiny. That it precedes all Proof and Reason is But stronger Proof, it springs instinctively; Something so natural to Man, that his Whole Being turns on it, the centre of his Bliss. 102. 'Tis this by which he moves concentric too With God: and so long as he has this clear, Strong Faith, so long his Movements are in true Harmonious Keeping with that wider Sphere. Now that by which a Being draws more near To its Perfection, is more likely to Be true, than what degrades it: cleave then here To this Belief, 'tis realized to you, By making ye Godlike, e'en tho' it came not true! 103. The stilly Hour, the silent, cool, is nigh, That swells the Heart with Rapture, and of Care Leaves but the Haze lest in Excess it die, To temper the intense Delight we share With Nature, lest it pain us: as in Air A light Cloud veils the Sun, who loses naught Save an Excess of Glory, thus we dare Else dazzled, gaze on him: all Things are wrought To Rest, and Sound too has the Touch of Silence caught! 104. A whispering Silence which its Murmurs break As the Stars break the Gloom, so stillily And sweetly: a few wandering Airs scarce shake The drowsy Leaves, not twinkling restlessly As is their Wont, but Emblems to the Eye Of blessÃ«d Quiet: cloistered with all Choice Of Bough and Leaf, the Nightingale hard by Sings, like a Soul just freed, but 'tis no Noise, 'Tis Silence self, who murmurs with herown sweet Voice! 105. The scarcewak'd Air with printless Step steals thro' His bowered Precincts, gliding from on high, Deeming the Music of the Spheres into That choral Grove has passed; so soothingly, The blithe, softthroated Strains fill Earth and Sky. And why not blithe! for he is pure and good And sings but to the Pure: nor Tear nor Sigh Knows he, still less the Evildoer's Mood, Who hues with his own fretful Thoughts, Bird, Stream, 106. The very Branches seem to bend them there and Wood. As if an Inspiration brooded o'er, Whose sweet compulsion moved all Things that bear A Touch of Feeling to bow down before The thronÃ«d Charmer. Silence would no more Be Silence: their bright Maze the Stars on high Are threading, one by one on Heaven's Floor, And at their sport Night smiles less solemnly, While Earth with wordless merriment rings far and nigh! 107. Now are the Spirits bathed in calm Delight, A waking Bliss, yet dreamy as the Hour, Joint Birth of Memory, Fancy, Hope and Sight Of palpable and future Things, whose Power In Fairytissue wove, Cameleonchild Of Heart and Brain, is instinct all with Truth, tho' wild: And what is Bliss, but as the Mind shall mould? An everchanging Proteus, living on That airy Food, Opinion! whom we hold With doubtful Grasp, but just so long as run Our Fancies in that channelâ o'er the Sun A light Cloud drifting with its gauzy Sail, Is touched to Beauty not its own: 'tis gone, And its Place knows it not! then what avail Its borrowed Hues, you say? they're briefly shown 'Tis true, yet while they last, are they not still its own? 108. E'en so across th' Horizon of Man's Life The empty Shows of Things pass swiftly by, Coined into Shape by Fancy: some in strife, Some calmly, coldly some, or glowingly As changeful Play of Hope and Fear the Eye May prompt to paint them with the thousand Hues Of Man's Protean Heart: one from on High Will call down Sights and Sounds, and thus produce The Heaven which he himself makes for his own Use. 109. For has not Fiction her sweet Tears, her Joys? Skytinctured Raptures, sweeter far than those With which the vulgar Mind its dull Taste cloys, Or stir a Heart by selfish Pleasures froze: Yes, she can mould a Fairyrace, which grows As out of Air, yet vivid with the Breath Of a not unreal Being, with whose Throes We sympathize: thus oft the Poet's wreath Is woven for the Brow which in his Dreams he seeth! 110. Some Hamadryad of the Heart, some Thought, Dreamlike and nymphlike, which his Fancy forms With fusÃ«d Memories, allbrightly caught, Like Rays converging, from a thousand Charms O'er Nature strewn, whose Fairyhues he warms With his Promethean Fire, 'till they start To Life, a cloudlike Juno in his Arms; Yet clasped with passionate Transport to his Heart, As if 'twere palpable; and of himself a part 111. It grows, a Thread knit with his Being's woof, And colored by his Heart, which torn away, The web is rent, and then he stands aloof, A hving Ruin scathed by Passion's Ray. For those who to Imagination's Sway Submit themselves unwisely, often find In him a hard Taskmaster to obey; Off with vain Shadows do they fight, and blind To earthlier Beauties love some Helen of the Mind! 112. Eternal Love, soft as a Star, o'erstreams The conscious Face of Heaven: his soft Breath, (Sweeter than sleeping Babe's, when Fairydreams, Hope's golden Exhalations, flit beneath The sealÃ«d Lids, like Rays of Heaven in Death,) Has swept Creation's manytonÃ«d Lyre, Which in Man's Heart misterious Answers hath; As if all blended in one mighty Quire, Earth, Ocean, Mountain, Sky, but echoed his Desire! 113. Solemn and sweet, and best to chastened Thought Adapted, like the low, full Anthem's Swell That dies out on a Summerevening, caught By the pleased Ear of Silence; a soft spell, Like the Goodman's last Sigh, which does but tell Of coming Bliss: faint, fainter, on it flows, Mellowing the Music of Copse, Stream, and Dell, Stirring the sleeping Flowers in Repose, 'Till like a whispered Prayer, inaudible it grows. 114. Still Meditation, with her dovelike Wings Winnows the Air to silence: nature seems Breathless and tranced; the only Sounds she flings Seem Murmurs syllabled in Love's sweet Dreams. How the deep Blue of Heaven softly streams Thro' the Acacia's feathery Foliage, so Soft Light thro' Rapture's drooping Eyelash gleams. The Birds on noiseless wing to covert go, Stirring the Leaves as Thoughts the stilly Heart, When Conscience has no sting, and Memory no Smart. 115. Some lagging Bee his droning Flight now wings Homewards, and Silence rests on Leaf and Flower, Unbroken, save where Cricket haply sings His Heart out, ever thus from Hour to Hour. The bright Dew falls like Light on Brake and Bower, It sparkles on the Violet's deep Blue, Like smiling Tears in Babe's sweet Eyes, and o'er The modest Lily's Head, the Rosebud's Hue, To which it gives the Scent which fresh from Heaven it drew. 116. And now above the icecrowned Mountainbelt, Like cold Ambition, shadowing all below, Herself unseen, the Moon's soft Smile is felt, As o'er Death's chill and pallid Brow will throw The Dawn of coming Life no doubtful Glow. See how the Crags are touched to Beauty by Th' emerging Orb, which pours in soothing Flow O'er the lit Lake, and there like Peace doth lie, On the Breast she has calmed, asleep so lovingly! 117. How sweet to wander 'neath her mellow Ray, Yielding to kindled Fancy the full Soul, To watch the mimic wave in idle Play Break, like the Bubbles on Hope's sparkling Bowl. To hear the low wind, like a whisper, roll, While Fancy hears in it some Voice of yore Once the Heartsmusic, now like to the Toll Of Passingbells: in vain we stand before The spectral Past and call, no Lip will answer more! 118. The Past! the Past! the phantompeopled Past, The populous Solitude of Memory! Grave of the Loved and Lovely withered fast, Where Grief's selfspringing Flowers never die: The chill Heart thro' thy dim veil might descry Sights that would blind, as on some barren Strand The shipwrecked Sailor views, with shuddering Eye, The dark Tide mockingly fling back to Land All that he loved, disfigured with Seaweed and Sand? 119. 'Tis sweet to think on those who love us well, The Fount of young Affections will gush o'er Still at the Thought: still are their Names a Spell, Like Blessings on our Lips for evermore. 'Tis sweet to think on that dear Spot, whose Power Over the Soul is such, that it can charm To Beauty the bleak Heath or rugged Shore: Whose very Name a Sweetness doth embalm Like to the Rose's, which all ill Thoughts can disarm! 120. Bless'd Spot! where guileless, Heart embraces Heart, And cold Suspicions jaundice not the Eye: Where we may feel and be, not play a Part In Life's dull Farce, and cold Formality: Sole Spot on Earth where we may heave the sigh And shed the Tear, yet not in Bitterness, For there we find the Balm of Sympathy, Whose Magictouch turns Grief to little less Than Joy. The Fountain as is its Supply Must flow, thus bless'd ourselves, we too have Power to bless! 121. 'Twas there, as in a newmade Paradise, A soul fresh from the Heavens, pure I grew And wanting naught: e'en as the Flowers rise That neither spin nor toil, and like them too I took no Thought unto the Morrow, drew No Breath but in the Present: Joy has Tears As well as Grief, and these alone I knew: There what we are and work out best appears, Heart Revelation makes to Heart, schools, explains, cheers! 122. There first I learnt to know and love my God, Not fear Him, as is mostly taught elsewhere: As if not Mercy, but Fear and the Rod Were his chief Attributes: from that best Prayer- Book, mine own Heart, what his Commandments were I learnt, and Love explained the Text to me. Not Prohibitions, but Commandments fair And gentle, teaching that the Heart should be A Law unto itself, constrained, but willingly! 123. Oh! is not Childhood a Foretype of Heaven, A mystic Shadowing of Eternity, Whose Meaning to the wiser few is given, Who learn to temper Thoughts that proudly fly With Childhood's Meekness and Simplicity? Who never, tho' they soar from Earth, forget Their Birthplace, or their Journey's Boundary: Aye, ye may clothe in Purple, ye may set The Crown upon your Brows, and yetâand yetâ As little Children must ye first become, (The words are Christ's), or enter not that Home! 124. Home! thou keynote of all Earth's Harmony! Cornerstone of the Temple of Man's Mind, Illplaced th' entire Building grows awry, No true Proportion therein can we find, Nor trace the Masterspirit, who designed It for his Dwellingâ Opensesame To the Heart's divine Treasures, to all kind Affections, Tears so sweet, that for them the Best Smiles of Joy would still poor compensation be! 125. Dew of the Spirit, that from stainless years Drawst thy sweet Being: thou pure Effluence From the Heart's virginsoil which in it bears No Plant of thorny Memory: from whence Spring Flowers too fair to last, whose Hues intense Are bright but fleeting as the Rainbow's by The passing Winds kissed off: thou art from hence Dew of the spirit, yet still from on high, Shook by some Angel's wings returning to the sky! 126. Sweet Tears! your Memory should blessÃ«d be, For ye, ye were all Blessedness and Love: Pure as Dew on the opening Rose, ere the Blight cankers it, or Bees its Sweets remove. The Angels only weep such Tears above, And thither ye exbale upon their wings Kissed off by them unseen, ere ye can prove The slightest stain of Earth's least earthly Things. Sweet Tears, shed on that Heaven, a Mother's Breast, When the young Heart was to it, like an angel's, prest! 127. Sweet Tears! would that mine Eyes might once more feel Your soft Drops melt them into Infancy: Making the Heart with its first Raptures reel: Raptures more deep than Passion's Revelry, Born of false Joys that die out in a Sigh, Mere Mockeries, still least, what most they seem. Alas! our Aftertears but dim the Eye Not brighten, and the Furrows where they stream Are formed by Childhood's Smiles: alas! that so Hope's purest Founts should but grow bitter as they flow! 128. Ye stand before me, like a pleasant Dream, Years of sweet Childhood, and transform the Past To present Time! on the old Hearth I seem Once more to stand, while mixed Thoughts, thick and fast, Which Memory clings to first and gives up last, O'erflow my Heart, which drinks them as Sands do Fresh Raindrops: Home, all that thou ever wast In Present, thou art still in Fancy: tho Full many a year's dark Wing be flown since then, Thy green Oasis fades not on my backward ken! 129. Like one who stands upon the cruel Deck That bears him Exile from his native shore, And marks it fading to the merest Speck, Yet struggles with fixed Eye the Waters o'er, Devouring its last Glimpse, 'till the dim Hour Snatch it from Sight and blend it with the Shade: Then inward turns to Fancy's soothing Power, Who Pictures of Life's loveliest Scenes has made For the sad Heart to gaze on and beguile Its Griefs, believing all to be as 'twas erewhile. 130. Thus too swept with the onward Tide of Life Far, far from that dear Spot which nourished me, Tho' round me brawl the rude World's chilling Strife Which few can share and pure and happy be, Still, still that cherished Spot my fond Eyes see, Still o'er the troublous waves that Beacon calls Me back, when from my better self I flee. And when the Play's out, and the Curtain falls, Home's hallowed Name shall sweeten my last Breath, And the first Thoughts of life blend with new Life in Death! 131. How sweet, when feverish Toil and Strife are o'er, To visit once again our longlost Home: We feel like one upon some happy Shore Cast forth from out the noisy Oceansfoam, While the dark waves run thundering on in Gloom Behind him: on the Greensward laid, sweet Sleep, Lulled by the very Roar that late his Doom Seemed pealing, sweeter by ContrÃ st, doth creep O'er his worn Sense, with Dreams made thus more sweet and deep 132. I left my Home, and all I loved still were, Tho' often at the Sabbathbell's sweet call I passed the churchyard, and the Gravestones there, Thickstrewn, preached eloquent the Lot of all, Tho' oft in Autumn I had marked the Fall Of the sere Leaf, I felt the Moral not, Or if 'twere felt its Influence was small, The Moral to a Tale, not mine own Lot: But Time has brought it Home, and changed is now that Spot 133. I left my Home, a Boy in Heart and Years: I wandered thro' strange Lands and visited Their wonders, dimmed by no prophetic Fears: Five times I saw the green Leaf bud: with Red Five times the Grape in Autumn overspread, And each time deep, sweet yearnings fell on me. It is not Life to fill with Lore the Head, We live but by the Heart, and meanwhile he Was gone, and made those years a Blank in memory! 134. Breathes there a man to whom the name of Home Is not a magic Spell, Epitome Of all that's good within him? let him roam Consorted best with Brutes: aye, let him be ExpellÃ«d from all sweet Society. The stamp of Cain is on his Brow, that curse The bitterest of all, a barren, dry, And selfish Heart is on him, Crime's chief nurse. Aye mark him well, for he with human Blood Will knead his Bread, and sell his Friend or curse his God! 135. Oh bitter 'tis on Earth to stand apart And think that there are none to love us more: When all the Tendrils twined around the Heart, That grew up with our Growth, and like the Flower, Blossom by Blossom shed, 'till that dark Hour Which withered Bloom and Branch, are torn away By some rude Hand, or scathed by Fate's dread Power, Claiming his Due: and bitter is the Day, When Home's Fireside for us no longer burns, When at cold Strangerhearths the Heart for its own yearns. 136. Why com'st thou thus, sad Spirit, to my Tongue? The darkest Lot has ever Light to guide, Some Balm to soothe, as Honey may be wrung From out the bitterest Flowers too: so Pride Has hardened not the Heart, for then abide Both Sting and Venom in the fester'd Wound. Pride, the vain Stoic, in his Breast would hide And quench his Anguish, still most wanting found When needed most; while Hearts that bow to Heaven Break not, for strength unto their weakness straight is given. 137. Let Sorrow do his worst: let Time frown on, He passes as the Tempest o'er the Brow Of placid Heaven, whose brief Fury done Th' immortal Lights the azure Vault o'erflow, And Storm and Darkness to new Beauty grow, Transformed to Elements of Peace: thus Faith Still reappears amid her bright Rainbow, And, Â«Heaven a Home eternal hasÂ», she saith, Where weary Spirits in God's Bosom rest, And where the Lost on Earth expect us'mid the Blest! 138. Farewell, sweet Clarens; time can ne'er efface Thine Image from my heart; false memory May yield her stores, but from the heart to rase Its cherished thoughts is vain, there must they lie For ever, dark or bright: tho' Time pass by And clothe the rifted rock with gladsome flowers Or rend anew, the rock will ne'er belie His nature, but is still the same: thus hours And years roll on, yet wear the heart in vain, For what Love graves upon its early bark, e'en pain, 139. And Cares and fretting woes but help to drive Deeper into the core: so too with thee, For all thy fairyscenes my heart must hive, Which as an undefilÃ«d well shall be Of purest Fancies, Touches of wild glee And reminiscence sweet; and if again I tread thy quiet shores: if fate to me Accord such choice, to me whose spirit fain Would drink of purer waters, on thy breast Great Mother-Nature here I'd lull my heart to rest! 140. That rest which shuns the crowded Mart, the Sink Of Vice and Worldliness, and lights on those Who keep themselves as children, and who drink Thy milk, great Mother! 'till the spirit grows To its right stature and the heart o'erflows With thy true lifeblood, for the world's rank food Breeds all unwholesome humours: soon we lose The sense of health and feverish fancies brood On the sick spirit, 'till the jaundiced sight Thy fresh, clear forms distorts, and hues thee with false light. 141. Thy shores are sacred, Leman! and thy name Is on my lips a spell, the spell which Mind, The mighty Wizard, flings around his Fame, 'Till men, halfdazzled, yield a worship blind To spirits towering so above their kind, Of Giantstature unto Good or Ill: Working their Maker's praise in thoughts that fill Men's Hearts with hidden Sympathies, and find Homes in all Lands; some sweating in Earth's mine, And some like visioned Seers who watch in God's own shrine! 142. Nor few, nor mean are those bright names which twine Their memories with thine, fair Lake! to thee We come, as willing pilgrims to the shrine Of mighty Genius: whate'er they be Who thus have left thy shores a spell, or free In the best sense of freedom, when the soul By Faith is selfsufficient, or might be Adorers of some creed, some Idol foul, Fair upperparts, but nether clay, we still Must pause and ponder upon names which Time's Ear fill! 143. Here dwelt the Proteus Voltaire, unreclaimed To God by thy bright scenery, which might Unsceptic any heart: much praised, much blamed By foolish tongues, like many a meaner wight, Deserving much of both: but in the fight, Truth's glorious Crusade 'gainst Tyranny To win God's Holy-City and the right Of godlike thought, no lofty Champion he; He saw the Goal yet chose Fame's vulgar Lot, Weigh him with Washington and learn what he was not. 144. He helped to raise the storm, and deemed his might, Like many a meaner Fool, could quell the same, But none have walked the waves, save Him, whose Light Was not of Earth: Voltaire had earned a name, Too sounding to last long, yet still 'twas Fame; He dared not look beyond the Present, nor Build on a glorious Future, for he came Of a false stock, and Vanity no Law But present Hire owns: the Crown he spurned, And to the glittering Bauble, like a Baby, turned! 145. An intellectual cook, he took a pride, A national pride to mince meat for the mind, And had much skill 'neath highwrought spice to hide His flimsy food, where wholesome stomachs find Small nutriment: what Time had left behind From the World's gathered wisdom, there he found His readymade materials, combined In thousand forms to suit the sick and sound, Philosophists, Moborators, all Palates, His wit the sauce that makes one swallow what one hates! 146. Like to a Fly of great Antiquity Who, (as old Esop tells the story), sate Much at his ease on some wheelaxletree, And as the carriage moved, with pride elate, Cried out, Â«see what a dust now I createÂ»; So Voltaire, like this great Exemplar, swept On with the wheels of Revolution's State, Thought that he moved it, when he would have crept But for a lucky concord of strange things, Scarcenoticed to his grave, like meaner Foolscapking. 147. But let him sleep with his own chaste Pucelle, And humbly pray he be not one of those Who having destroy'd Heaven, find a Hell Whereof they dreamt not: such men's wisdom grows, Like Serpents, from the filth a wise mind throws Aside in scorn, and stinks of whence it came. But let them spit their venom: Heaven knows To draw good e'en from thence, and to their shame And its own Glory turns the feeble spite Which breaks but its own teeth in such unequal fight. 148. Aye let him sleep with his own chaste Pucelle, Who bore to his coarse Lust a bastardrace And sickly, like all Sin: yet Genius well From holy wedlock and that maid's embrace Might have raised up high offspring to efface Th' Ingratitude which France to her has shown, Creating thus for her a lofty place (Her name at length by Fame's pure trumpet blown) Amid her Country's hallowed memories, A shrine of Poesy, for Worth that never dies. 149. But for a nobler Hand that Task had Fate Reserved, a foreign Hand: when Schiller rose, Like a bright Star, he took unto his Mate That maiden portioned only with her Woes And Insults: as his Spirit's Bride he chose Her Spirit, and he gazed until she grew Distinct in that bright Shape which to him owes Its Being, and into her Breast he threw His own Heart's Warmth, and breathed upon her cheek Love's Hue! 150. But Voltaire had no soul for these high things, His was no sacred calling; Poesy Sunk 'neath his weight, for her celestial wings Will not lift earthly burthens to the sky: Thus fell he to the dust, there let him lie: Nor let his scoffs alarm the good; their fears Insult that Being in his majesty, Who to man's petty malice and brief years Opposes his high Wisdom and all Time: Drawing the shape of perfect Good from passing Crime! 151. He will not stoop to crush a worm like this: And that is shallow wisdom which still sees In Evil nought but Evil: Man may miss, God never does: he moulds with equal ease Things which to us seem but Anomalies, (Because the mighty plan is but half seen,) Into one whole of perfect harmonies, Where all is as it should be, what has been Sowing the seeds of that which is to be; And man, frail portion of this vast machinery, 152. Still striving with his spiderweb to stay Its mighty movements, of whose countless Springs Not one, one least is ever out of play; In whose Infinitude of parts, of things And Natures adverse, all moves like the wings Of the windcleaving Bird, with no less Ease And Harmony: but yet in Leadingstrings, And with an Eye distorting all it sees, Man with his Ellwandwisdom still will dare To measure God, and displace Him for a Voltaire! 153. As, in the Animalworld, the sanke and toad Are poisonfurnished for wise purposes, Each framed by Nature with appropriate load To suit the end for which it lives and dies, So, in the Moralworld, a Voltaire plies His destined task, and has his poison too; With this sole difference, that Voltaire lies Unto his Being's End and Aim, altho' His own works witness that he had the Light. Thus, like the Blind worm, he too labours in God's sight! 154. I turn to fickle Rousseau's brighter name, Whom Pity should commiserate, for he Was of another clay: he too sought fame More nobly, if less wisely; to be free And make free, was his boast, but who could be Such, and know Freedom? he was one whose brain Was wormed by vain conceits, and easily Stung into madness by the smart and pain Of petty Insectenvy, thus in vain For self and others lived he, but his works remain, 155. A lesson and a warning, where we learn The sad tale of a spirit lost, a mind Made unto better things; where we discern The nobler aspirations of a blind Tho fervid Intellect which gropes to find A light that is denied it, a bright ray Of unadulterated Truth, untined By Earth's dull superstitions; but the way He chose from Nature unto Nature's God Led not, and thus in Error's Labyrinth he trod. 156. He too was Nature's lapchild, and on him She showered her dangerous Gifts of mind and heart From her full Plentyhorn; but full of whim And fickleness he grew, nor had the art, Like all spoilt children, to her gifts t'impart That crowning grace which man himself must give, Or else atone by many a bitter smart For slow selfgoverment, taught how to live This weekday life in the world's heartless school, Anatomized by the chanceglance of every fool! 157. Alas! for these high gifts, when 'neath the rein They will not bend their proud and fiery necks By Reason curbed, a heritage of pain, Under this boon of Glory, Nature makes Inalienably ours; yea! she takes A heavy payment at some future day: Our spirits with an ironrod she breaks Beneath Time's galling yoke, and for the ray Of divine light thus prematurely given, We live in Hell, with capabilities for Heaven! 158. Then Peace unto his Ashes, may they rest! He suffered, if he erred, and much he bore Martyr to self and others; e'en the best Have many faults and failings, and the Lore Of God's own Page instructs us to pass o'er Man's faults in mercy, since we may not know The Heartsprings, Movings, or lay bare the core Of the soul's hidden soil, where ofttimes grow Seeds of strange sap and fruit; such hearts as his, From the deep spirit's mines coin all their woe and bliss! 159. Lausanne! thy name too calls up Gibbon's shade From that Eternity of life which he Made light of, he who godlike reason made To undermine itself: and deemed him free From vulgar prejudice, yet Slave would be E'en to the basest which Man's spirit chain To this soulsoiling Earth; from off the tree Of Knowledge its ripe fruit he plucked, in vain: He felt not his own nakedness, but strode A selfmade Giant, and his Pride would own no God! 160. Thus may we learn how little all the wealth Of learning, heaped in many-a busy year With beelike Industry, produces health Of moral Being, if Faith stand not near To quicken into Wisdom what we tear From Time's fastturning pages: idle Lore! A seed that no lifeprinciple can bear, Leaving us in our boasted wealth more poor Than the worst Ignorant who lifts on high His prayer, yet has no name for one star in the sky! 161. That is no vulgar Error which all Man- Kind puts its Faith in! 'tis the one Man who Goes wrong, who, deeming himself greater than The Mass, is less in Wisdom, in all true Philosophy than it: for it is through The Mouth of all that God speaks clearest, by The Heart of all is best revealÃ«d too. What all Hearts feel and see, is no vain Lie, 'Tis then no single Heart, but God's own Heartand Eye! 162. For all Men's Hearts when blent together make Up God's own Heart: their Minds when fused in one Allmighty Thought the Spirit of His take. Tis then no more one erring Man alone Tho' still but one, yet the one true Man, grown To his true stature, like to God: yea! as Christ was like God; and as God's Form is shown In this whole World, as in a Magicglass, So in this one whole Man, all that as Man He was, 163. Yea, from the First, and is, and can, and will Be ever on! then all that this one Man Believes of himself, that will God fulfill, It will come true, worked out in Being's Plan; 'Tis God in him believes it, and how can What God believes be false? this Faith is too Before and above Reasonâit began With Life itself: without it is no true Existence, nor aught Godlike can Man think or do! 164. And yet the proud Philosopher disdained To think as all Men, as the Many do! As if Truth were not surest thus attained! As if all were not likelier to think true, And feel true, than the one vain Mortal, who Withdrawing himself from his kind, thereby Ceases to be a Manâfor only thro' All can the one be truly soâand why? Because what all Men think and feel eternally, 165. That makes the Man, that keeps him so in Spite Of Change of Time and Place, in Greece, or on The Nile, or Thames, or Seine: the Mass goes right, For it feels as with one grand Heart alone; The Paltriness and Meanness of the one Have no Share in it: it comprizes all Man's godlike Hopes and Interests, but none Save theseâeach Mode and Pulse, both great and small, Of Being, each high Yearning, and each holy Call, 166. Each clear prophetic Insight, and each high Convictionâthro' Belief it lives, and thro' Love, and unfailing Hope eternally. Doubt palsies Action, paralyzes too The Soul, dries up the Source from whence it drew All GrandeurâDoubt of God puts out the Eye Of Reason, by which these men boast to do So much: as if Truth could be found save by Belief in God, from whom it flows eternally! 167. This Doubt destroys the Sap by which Life's nursed, Cuts the Mainroot; thus all Things give the Lie To Doubtâthus, like the withered Fig Christ cursed. It stands alone, a mere Anomaly, Containing in itself, to every Eye Save its own, its best Refutation: so, So wondrous are the Plans of the Most High! The Fool must still with his own Finger show Himself, and from his very Folly may we know 168. Better than e'en from Wisdom herself, how, How mighty is He! that which stands alone Has got the Stamp of Decay on its Brow! 'Tis strange, perverted, false, and pleases none But the pervertedâNature will not own, Nor among her enduring Works give place Unto, it; with the Finger it is shown, But takes no Hold upon the Humanrace, Nor in Mankind's great Heart leaves any lasting Trace! 169. And yet, methinks, at that still Midnighthour, The Labours of a Life completed, when, Exulting in the Consciousness of Power, His mortal Hand first laid aside the Pen Which was to blazon to the Praise of Men His Name, th' immortal Soul must then have felt The GodlikeâGod! within itâyet e'en then He uttered no Thanksgiving, neither knelt Nor spake that Name which in the stars he might have spelt. 170. Whose Sweetness from the Flowers at his Feet Was breathed forth on him; and when he looked on The blue Expanuse of Waters, like a Sheet Of Chrystal thro' the Acacia's foliage shown, The Glass, spread out before his Sight alone, Full of the silent wonders of the Skies, Saw he not there his Maker's Image thrown From those blue Depths, where in so stilly Wise He works his godlike work, while round him set and rise 171. Unnumbered Worlds, with less noise than a Leaf Falls from, or bursts upon, the TreeâAnd there, At that sweet Moment so unique and brief, In which the Sweetness was summed up, as 'twere The Rose's scent, of Years of Promise fair, Crowned by that Instant: while around him lay Lausanne, with not a Voice to stir the Air, While he and God were each, tho' in a way So widely different, watching o'er their Works, what pray 172. Were Gibbon's Thoughts? or what his Maker's, while He looked down on the poor worm in the Dust Full of himself, and with a quiet Smile That sparkled thro' each Star, reproved Man's Lust Of Fame, the paltry Longing for the Bust And pointed Finger, by his own so, so Sublime and stilly Watchfullness, which must Have touched the Sceptic's Soul, in Earth below And in the millioneyÃ«d Heaven o'er his Brow! 173. What were his Thoughts? who knows? the Hour is gone- The Man is Dustâa Nameâa Memoryâ His Being lost to us, like some stray Tone Breathed from a Flute and heard no more: but why Did he disclaim the sublime Luxury Of feeling at that Moment as it were A Fellowworker with the Deity? Merged in the Whole, he might have said, Â«these are Thy Works, great God! myself, the Flower and yon' Star: 174. My Works are thy Works, thou art in me, I In thee at all Times, but most now, e'en now When most I feel Thee: thou art in mine Eye, Else could I not behold the bright Stars how, How godlike they do shine: yea! it is thou That prayest in me, else I could not pray. Father! the least of all thy works doth show Thy Glory forth, then grant that mine too may Not do less than yon star with its so modest Ray!Â» 175. Is it less godlike then because it does Not say, Â«behold my Light!Â» it shines alone, And pays in silent awe the Debt it owes, Quite sure that God will not neglect e'en one Of all his Works: not e'en the least Streak on The Dayseye! and wilt thou not do likewise, Or wilt thou snatch a Trumpet to make known Thy Nothings, as if God had got no Eyes, To rob thy Heart of its so still and godlike Prize! 176. The Sense of the Unutterable, which Man with his God may share: the Feeling, by Which we beyond all Wealth are rendered rich, Of working out, as if unconsciously, The Godlike, as if unto the Most High, And not to us, the Praise alone were due. Sublime Renouncing of all Vanity, Which, for that paltry Feeling, lifts us to God himself, who our least Works then will view As his, and wrought out thus they are so too! 177. And when thou look'dst on His Works round thee spread, Each on its Task intent, so silently, Didst thou ask if thine own too answerÃ«d Their End as well as the least Flower by Thy proud Foot crushed? didst thou lift up thine Eye, And ask thyself if thy Works in their kind Bore Witness, like the least Star in yon Sky, Unto thy Maker? alas! no: thy Mind Wrought out of God and in His Works thy Works could find 178. No Place and no Acceptance! could then thy Long Toil accomplish nothing more than this? Hadst thou sought Truth so long and eagerly, And couldst not track her Steps of Light to his High Presence, whence, and whence alone she is? Couldst thou feel Truth and not feel him likewise In her? alas! they still the Truth must miss, Who like thee seek it, who keep still their Eyes Fixed on their paltry Selves, and not upon the Skies! 179. And couldst thou with divine Intelligence Not do so much as the least Worm, to show Thy Maker's Glory forth? oh Impotence Of human Pride! which boasting thus to know More than its Fellowmen, can with its so, So boundless Lore not lift itself unto The one, grand Truth, which from all Things doth flow, Like Light, upon us: thus by feeling true, Fools prove what Gibbon with his Wisdom could not do! 180. Copet, De StaÃ«l has hallowed thee, and made Thy name the spirit's Restingplace, where we Repose awhile, like Pilgrims, 'neath the Shade Of some fairfruited, and widespreading tree, Hard by which flows a Fount of pure and free And holy Waters: from her Womansheart She drew her wisdom, and if Error be Blent still where Feeling takes too large a Part, Yet from Jove's Head alone Minerva could not start! 181. One more demands my song, not least tho' last Of that bright Galaxy, which must for aye Shine on ward in Time's Heaven, and outlast The many Shootingstars whose feebler ray But lights their fall, until the final day Shall gather round the Brow of the most High Truth's scattered beams, which from Time's birth their way Have followed: like the bright Stars in the Sky, Earth's constellations set, and new their Place supply 182. A Name which is as Poetry: a spell Of blended power to wake remembrance bright And vain regret: for who the hopes shall tell Which grew unto that name, and with its might Their aspirations twined: alas! a blight Was at the core of that fairseeming tree, Its lifesap poisoning: and tho' to sight Its wild Luxuriance promis'd fruit to be, 'Twas spent in idle bloom and flourished outwardly. 183. Oh that some tones of Inspiration might Light on my trembling lips, which thus essay To sing his memory: some words of light Not allunworthy of the mighty Lay. Oh that some transient gleam, some kindred ray From the bright Brow of Poesy might fling Its spell on my weak spirit and thus lay My fears at rest; for who such theme may sing In fitting notes, unless like Spirit he shall bring? 184. But to my task; yet first on Truth I call To aid me with her presence calm, lest Praise Undue, or foul Detraction haply fall With leprous Influence upon my Lays, And blight the feeble wing which strives to raise Heaven wards its flight: for thence her Blessing is, And there her Home; and tho' I'm young in days, Yet do I deem her smile man's highest bliss, Reward, and Inspiration, tho all else he miss! 185. He too was one of those sent down by Heaven From Time to Time, like portions of its Light, To hallow this our clay, in mercy given. Yet still as is the Darkness of the Night So in Proportion shine the Stars more bright, And dimeyed mortals to each rising Ray Turn, as if it alone could lead them right: But with the calm Light of returning Day Too oft they find that it has led them but astray! 186. His words were firewords, his voice a spell, Wherewith the potent charmer could dethrone At will Men's thoughts: alas! he knew too well All the Heartsinlets, and each varied tone Of its most complex music was his own, And waked with mastery, as tho' he were Its framer; but his erring skill was shown In Syrentouches sweet, he sought not there The holier echoes which true Poets wake and share. 187. The Lay he struck, (whose fancyvarying tone Could scarce be deemed of earthly minstrelsy, But claimed an Inspiration of its own, Like to the windswept Harp, and seemed to sigh With other sympathies than man's), on high Its voice ne'er sent: alas! it was no string In Heaven and Earth's accordant Harmony, Hymning its Maker's praise, but oft would fling Far earthlier voice, and with unholy echoes ring. 188. And yet his Inspiration was the Light Of Heaven: but as the stream some Tinge will take From off the Soil it flows on, and tho' bright Is bittertasted, so must Genius make A blessing or a curse as we awake Its energies to Good or Ill, and mould Our clay with its Promethean fire: a snake That twines around the soul its smothering fold, Or bright and glorious as the Prophet's dreams of old! 189. Thou too loved'st Truth, but not as they should love Who deem of her correctly and her power In the heart's inmost Shrine and Temple prove: Thou madest her but the Goddess of an hour, And worshipp 'dst her amiss, and thus her dower Of majesty and might was not for thee: Thou shouldst have known that those who basely lower The Deity they bow to, are not free Nor great, but slaves to a selfcoined Idolatry. 190. Oh Byron, Byron such should'st thou have been, Then would thy name on Falsehood's drowsy Ear Break like a thunderclap, and Truth be seen To dwell on Earth in vesture scarce less fair Than that pure sheen which she is wont to wear In her empyreal home: then Plato's dream For us had been fulfilled: what heart would dare To doubt the Deity, when thus her beam Shone on the Sceptic's sight, to awe, to quicken and redeem? 191. But thou, alas, wouldst pluck a meaner wreath, Which is already fading from thy brow, Frail, perishable as the fickle breath Of man, that bade it bloom, and lays it low In its untimely dust; yea, even so We reap a mighty moral, and thy name Teaches us more than learnÃ«d Pedants know: Aye it instructs us on what stalk true Fame Alone will grow, in every Clime unchanged, the same! 192. The True alone, yea! since the World began, And to the latest Day 'twill still be so, Delights enduringly the Heart of Man, Abides with him, and like himself, can know No Change: for howsoever oft below The Chrysalis may cast its Slough, yet his Essence is also Truth, which still doth throw In Thought and Deed its Halo over this Poor Dust, reminding him for aye of whence he is! 193. The one grand Incarnation here of the Divine Intelligence: the one, the true Man, he whom in his sublime Unity All mankind makes up, errs not, as we do, We single Men, what he approves, that too God sanctions, for the Godlike he alone Delights in, and can only do so thro' That same divine Intelligence: thus shown In chusing nought but what its sublime Source will own! 194. Unerringly, and as it were too, by A divine Instinct, does it cast away The False, UnnaturalâNo Pedantry In the Selection does it e'er display, Nor doubts an Instant what to keep or lay Aside, nor needs dull Rules its Taste to Guide. What it delights in, still remains for aye To all Men everywhere a Joy and Pride, It speaks with God's own Voice, and over Seas can stride! 295. Go ask the scottish Peasant when he sees His blazing Hearth, why Burns's Cottarsnight Successive Generations still can please? And naively will he answer, while Delight Kindles his cheek, Â«because that which my Sight views daily, and my Heart feels daily, he Has there pourtrayed.Â» and if thou 'st heard aright, Not one poor erring Man's Words will those be, But Generations speak and Nature teaches thee! 196. What passes on from Tongue to Tongue for aye, And charms the Child upon its Grandam's knee, As her too when a Child, of bygone Day The Song, in which the old Heart speaks to the New Heart so clearly, understandably, In that eternal Language changing ne'er, E'en when the Words both quaint and antique be, To this still Nature lends a willing Ear; The same old Spirit still in Life's fresh Forms so near! 197. Its Voice is on the Mountains; to the Eye, The young Eye, still it calls back the old Tear Of primal Feeling: still so boyantly It beats within the Bosom, as if ne'er Before a human Breast with that same Fear Or Hope had throbbedâ and yet 'tis oldâ old as The Heart of Adam! thus still fresh and clear, Renewed eternally, yet what it was, It travels on for aye, 'till back to God it pass! 198. The nothingness of this vain Present threw Its blight upon thy spirit's Energy; Thy Heart was not at one within, but grew 'Mid wrestling aspirations, and no high Or lofty goal can be attainÃ«d by Divided efforts, tho'a Giant were To make the Essay: grovelling hopes that die With heavenly aspirations have no share, Like baneful weeds they grow, and poisonfruit must bear. 199. Thou shouldst have been th' apostle of thine age Teaching a higher truth, a purer creed To the Earth's erring nations: and thy Page Fraught with Â«GladtidingsÂ», then had earned its meed. A blessing from on high, and sown the seed That dieth not, but soon or late must yield Its glorious harvest: in the hour of need Thy name had been a watchword and a shield, When Tyranny shall fall on Truth's bright Battlefield. 200. Alas! thou daredst not to be great or good, Nor to fulfil the glorious destiny To which Truth beckoned thee; Fame by thee stood, Fame, the Earthborn, whose hollow glories lie In the vile breath of men; she caught thine Eye, Tooeasydazzled, and the Future's meed Seemed in the distance but a mockery; Truth will not own a Heart thus halved: her creed Is all or none, she leans not on a wavering Reed! 201. For this she never from thy lips has spoke Her oracles nor with her high behest E'er hallowed thee; her Inspiration broke In smouldering flashes from thy darkling breast, As tho' it sought a fitter place of rest, A holier altar, than a heart like thine Profaned by Pride and Passion; whence her best And holiest beams in fitful Glory shine, Leaving no calm, pure Light, no Glow of Worth divine 202. The light that burned in thee, but burned in strife: No calm, still, allpervading Warmth whose light, Sunlike, might kindle into healthy Life The products of a world; in flashes bright, Brighter from out the spirit's gloom, its Might Burst lightninglike, spent oft in Earth's vile Mire; It shone in barren beauty and the sight Was dazzled, but not guided; scathing fire, Wild passion's tempestbirth, scattering its strength in Ire. 203. The heavenborn Genius which dwelt in thee, Which should have hallowed thee to Glory and Undying praise among the Good and Free, Whom Time delights to honor, was a brand, Which, tho' allquenchless, Passion's wild breath fanned Into a false and flaring flame; its Light Was from on high, and therefore mortal hand Could not extinguish, but in Error's night It flashed, like flickering flame from smoke, upon the sight, 204. But Truth seeks still the upright heart and pure: E'en as the lambent flame must mount on high, Smokefree and strong, for it will not endure To hide its brightness, but must mount or die; Like will to like: and spirits of the sky When prisoned in an earthly breast still crave Some purer air: in torment fret, and fly In scorn away, as risen from a Grave, Leaving the heart they loved Earth's unredeemÃ«d slave. 205. Thus Truth within a holy breast will dwell In peace and love, with calmattempered power Moulds it into her likeness, and her spell Allcirculating, hallows more and more Its sanctuary, with inspired Lore Still oracles the soul; but in a breast Which earthly hopes and passions triomph o'er, She gnaws still at the heart, a vultureguest, And'mid its writhing throes still speaks her dread behest! 206. Such Inmate was she, Byron, in thy heart; She scathed, and not enlightened thee, and why? Oh let them answer who have felt her smart! Is it not writ in words that shall not die, Â«Thou shalt not worship God and MammonÂ»? lie Not those unto the Holy Spirit who Profane to earthly Uses gifts so high As those which thou wast hallowed with? why grew The ashesfruit on such fair tree? say, wast thou true, 207. True to thyself or God? didst thou place first In word and deed that which thou felt'st to be Thy Being's Highest: didst thou quench thy thirst At Truth's pure founts, or to Idolatry Debase thy soul, and make thy life a lie, An acted falsehood: tho' the heavenly ray Still reassert its destination high For a brief moment, as it seemed to say, Â«My light is not of EarthÂ», yet straight it fades away. 208. Present with Future, and the nothingness Of Now with Immortality, aright Thou couldst not weigh: in this alone far less Than many a meaner spirit: from the Height Of Fame thou look'dst, and dazzled grew thy Sight: But soon, th' Intoxication pass'd, thy mind Turned on itself the Venom of Despite: And in thy spirit's desolation, blind, Thou an immortal Essence sought'st, yet couldst not find! 209. Fame's paths are many: Glory knows but one, To mould himself unto his Century: To rule it as its slave: to take his tone Of thought and action from it, low or high, As suits the Time, and with the Time thrown by, The actor's changeful mask, who plays at need, King, Hero, Bufloon, Knave, indifferently: This is Fame's ready path, that hollow reed On which Fools lean their weight and wisemen' neath them tread 210. But Glory in men's breath dwells not, she lives Not in the passing day: her victories Are calm and quiet harvests, and she gives To each good reaper what is duly his: What he has earned by patient Zeal: her Prize The Crowd awards not, tho' a Nation may, With Time and Truth for bribeless Witnesses. But he who has deserved it waits his Day Contented, his own Heart itself can best repay! 211. And still the more godlike, the more he by The World goes unrewarded: for the pure, Full consciousness in sublime certainty, Of having acted not for any Lure Or Bait the world can hold out, is his sure, His best Reward: this Feeling alone is A Recompense that makes King's Gifts seem poor! And tenfold sweeter God makes it to his Enjoyment, by the Loss of all Reward save this! 212. Thy spirit should have dwelt alone: a sea, In boundless vastness, taintless purity, And communed with itself: for ever free From those earthborn repinings which on high Fling their doubtmists, and shut from man's dim Eye Truth's azure Heaven: thus wouldst thou have been Allselfsufficient: and thy Destiny Been moulded to that sequence and that mien, That unity of heart and aim so rarely seen. 213. Thy towering spirit should have stood alone, Alike above the Present's petty praise, And pettier scorn: and as the glorious sun Touches to beauty with his heedless rays The clouds that bar his course, so in the blaze And brightness of thy onwardbearing might Had Envy sunk, or brought herself the bays With hand reluctant, in th' approving sight Of nations led by thee, their Joshua, aright 214. To the far Land of Promiseâbut alas! Such godlike Task was not for thee: thine Eye, Thy divine Eye was filmy: nor could pass Beyond the Present: when Truth's Accents high Would warn the Nations, they must not speak by Such Lips as thine: say why did Milton live A Life of more than Epic Majesty: Or Socrates, Truth's holy Martyr, strive In the Â«good FightÂ» and his own Life so nobly give 215. A freewilloffering to the cause he loved, Think'st thou they sought the Emptiness of praise, The bubble Reputation? they who proved Their worth so nobly that their names might raise The dead to testify to Falsehood's face The Glory which she hates yet bows before: They sought for that which Time shall ne'er erase, In their own Gianthearts they found a store Of Impulse and Reward, nor wished nor asked for more! 216. Into how small a space thy bulk doth shrink, When with such names as these thy claims we weigh, Ambition! who upon their lives can think, Nor spurn thee, yes: let Sophistry essay Her subtlest arts, and in her best array Disguise thy native Ugliness: yet still Thou art a foul deceit; let History lay Thy boasted names with these, e'en Envy will Affirm that these true Glory's claims do best fulfill. 217. Some reparation to mankind is due For wasted Effort, and perverted power: But in the moral of thy life anew We learn an illknown Truth; true Wisdom's lore Is the slow growth of Time, told o'er and o'er 'Till the dull World is warmed to Sympathy With thoughts it heeded not: thus too the Dower Which Byron bequeathed unto us was a high And solemn Truth which unprolific should not lie. 218. Wisdom at Times a costly sacrifice Asks of Mankind, for meaner victims might Pass unremarked, but when the Mighty dies, Truth at the deathpyre her calm torch doth light, And mournful waves it as a Warningsight To an observant World: when Byron died It seemed as tho' a sun had set in night Dark, premature: for tho' his Fame spread wide, No Eveningglow, the morn's bright promise, did abide. 219. For Byron was not one of those who make Of Time, Futurity: he could not lay His heart at rest, or toil for Truth's sole sake, In the calm sunshine of her holy day: The lofty consciousness, whose strong, calm Ray Feeds still the lamp of Immortality: He heeded not her voice, but turned away To dwell among the Scoffers, thus his high Unearthly Lyre lent its strings to tones that die 220. Aye, and he reaped the harvest his rash hand Had thus unwisely sown, yet Sympathy May shed an honest tear, tho' Truth must brand His name with many a sad Infirmity Which Wisdom scorns to own, and Pity's Eye Would gladly turn away from, if he erred, He was soretempted by the flattery Of this cold selfish world, which in him stirred Up feverish aspirations: like a shackled bird, 221. His Spirit longed for Freedom, but in vain: Bruised 'gainst its Prisonbars it died away In feebler tones, yet waking up again Dim echoes of their native skies, as they Were voiced in slavery, yet seemed to say, Â«I am not that I should be, or might beÂ»: Sad in their very sweetness and a lay Of grief heartsmothered: such as the oncefree Will sing in foreignlands, to cheat sad memory. 222. The World, as is its wont, was quick to smile Its harlotglance of flattery, which tho' Most rich in promise, serves but to beguile The credulous; they to men's breath who owe Their fame, will see it bubblelike still grow Vaster and brighter as it nears its End; For the cold world but little cares to know The throes which with the Poet's spirit blend Their fiery Energies; it seeks t'amuse, not mend. 223. Like some ferocious brute, at times 'twill play With its poor victim, ere it show the power And will to crush his soul; at first 'twill lay His fears asleep, but when the fit is o'er It casts him off, and flattering no more, Plucks the Veil rudely from his cheated Sight, And bids him learn the Thing he isâ the sore, Deep Degradation, which with Poisonblight Eats still into his Soul, and palsies its best Might: 224. Stinging his heart with sense of grievous Wrong, A fiery Indignation, which will flame And feed upon his spirit, 'till his song Grow dark and bitter, and his very name A byword to the sneering World, the same That led astray and marred; then will he live At war with all mankind, and tho' we blame, Yet must we pity too, for his heartshive Was robbed of all the honey selfcontent can give. 225. In him the milk of humankindness is Turned into Gall and Bitterness, in vain Would Time awake an Aftersense of bliss, The Festerwound must rankle still and pain; And tho' it close, can never feel again The Unity of health; his heart can know No peace, and tho' his haughty soul disdain To bare its throes, its Light in gloom must flow, 'Tis but the beauty of the storm, the rainbow's glow. 226. His very light was darkness, and his sun Set e'er the Evening of its cloudy day; Not as the Orb, his bright course duly run, In fullmatured and holy beauty may Sink to his timely rest, with such calm Ray As promises a brighter dawn, but dim With cloud-and tempestgloom; alas! he lay A proud Wreck on Time's sea, for who can trim His sails aright, enslaved by Passion, Doubt and Whim? 227. What tho' his bold, skysoaring spirit fleeth Beyond this Earth, his hand no Pledge doth bear, No Earnest of that better bourne, no Wreath, No Olivebranch of Peace to Man; he ne'er Has trod that blessed spot, nor tasted there The fount that should baptize him unto Life And Immortality: but tho' so fair, 'Tis as a fallen Spirit, whom the Strife Against its Nature must of half its Light deprive. 228. An heavenscaling Titan, on the Wing Of daring Thought, he strove the pure Spherelight, Like Lightning, to draw down: from Fate to wring A new Promethean Fire by the Might Of his earthwearied Spirit: such bold Flight Needed a calm and patient Wing, but he Rose, like the hooded Falcon, to that Height, Only to tumble back to Earth, and be Reminded by the Fall that Pride is Vanity! 229. Yet if he erred in life, his death may well Atone for many Errors: on his brow It stamped Truth's seal and gave his name, a Spell, To coming generations; nothing low Or selfish mighled with this last bright glow Of reborn Virtue, who a PhÅnix rose Brighter from out her ashes; he did grow Unto a nobler stature and lifesclose Forbade Death's triomph, and the Grave his sting did lose. 230. He felt his Faith had been an empty creed, A Lie unto his Being's End, its best And holiest tendencies; his soul thus freed From spectredoubts, he sought within his breast To kindle up once more Truth's high Behest, Illunderstood, which long there smouldering lay, A sindimmed flame, thus strove to set at rest The vulture conscience; and life's closingday Twined round his fading brow true Glory's death less ray. 231. Farewell is not a word for thee, for thou Art of all ages; dust will unto dust, Stern Time will claim his own, and much lay low That is not for Eternity: the rust Will eat the oncebright steel, yet still I trust That much of thee shall live for aye, and find Some nobler token than a paltry Bust Or idle Cenotaph; th' immortal mind Some bright remembrance in men's hearts still leaves behind 232. Thou taught'st thy Fellowmen an erring Creed, But Nature spoke by theeânot her own clear, Calm Voice, tho' very sweet: thee too she freed From that deep scorn of man whose bitter sneer Distorts thy smile into a Devilsleer Of Irony, until we turn away With mingled feelings of disgust and fear; But when on Nature's bosom thou dost lay Thy panting heart, thy voice doth like her Echo play; 233. For to full life she springs within thy arms, Glowing with passion warmer than thine own, Aud in her full Divinity of charms Fills thee with Love and Beauty, till thy tone Seems an o'erflowing harmony, unknown To mortal ears, a spell which fills the Sky Above, and Earth beneath, and Ocean lone With vocal minstrelsies; as from on high The soul and source of music poured its deep stream by! 234. Methinks I see thee on old Adria's shore, Gazing upon the boundless deep, that lies In its farstretching solitude, before Thy feet, a solitude from whence arise, Like spirits, thoughts that grasp the Earth and Skies In their Immensity; thy troubled breast Heaves as the sea, and from its core, which is Deeper than the deep Ocean, halfexprest Thy mighty yearnings shake from off the soul its rest, 235. And speak; Prophet and Poet all in one Thou seem'st; e'en the vast ocean's self by thee Might voice himself, and nothing lose; upon Thy brow the spirit of old Times I see, Glowing and vivid as 'twas wont to be, With thoughts that will not be concealed, but gleam Thro' the dark veil of dim mortality Like lightningflashes; but enough, I dream Of things that are not, tho' to the wild brain they seem. 236. But thou, tho' Nature's Lapchild, lovedst not her With that calm, deep, enduring Love, which makes Us allunfit for this world's busy Stir, Its feverish hopes, and all the thousand aches That wait on him whose bark Life's tempest shakes, Having no quiet Haven of sweet Rest. He who loves Nature from sin's thralldom breaks, And moulds his heart, like hers, to that same blest And selfcontented mood, which still she teaches best, 237. Mighty Philosopher! whose Wisdom lies In her own deep content, who asks no more Than that she has, to richest Usuries Of joycreating Joy her boundless store She places out, from every passing Hour Reaping her rich returns; but we, we fools! Betterexampled by the meanest flower, We spurn the gentle laws by which she rules All things for their own Good: for we, have other schools 238. Farewell oncemore, but pardon let me ask, If in my nothingness I deem that I Can grasp thee with my measure: 'tis a task For other might than mine: (if I belie In aught the Truth 'tis most unwittingly, For I do love her in my inmost heart, And would not lie unto her tho' to die And speak were one: for there's no bitterer smart Than Conscience unto those who love Truth's upright part. 239. Byron I love thee but the Truth still more, And therefore have I thus essay'd to show Thy faults that thou mightst stand revealed before Our Eyes in thy true stature: even so 'Twixt Right and Wrong we learn at length to know The boundaryline, and Genius may see That Talent still needs Conscience, and that no Production can endure unless Truth be Its Groundwork, else 'tis but as a sandrooted Tree. 240. Man loves the True alone thro' Ages; tho' The False and the Exaggerated may Be for awhile in Vogue, they can have no Enduring Influence: Time wears away Their Glitter, and the Heart grasps not for aye An empty Shadow, but soon turns anew To see things as they are in God's clear Day, And by its human Yearnings still kept to Its Sphere, by Instinct seeks the Natural and True! 241. But thou, thou didst not estimate thy Kind Arightâ thou saw'st the Ill alone which lies Upon the Surface, like a Sore: still blind To the much Good, which, hid from all Men's Eyes, Lives but for its own self, and for the Skies. Thou sought'st in o'erwrought Phantasies Delight, Not knowing that in Poverty's Worst Hovel many a Beggar to the Height Of Epic grandeur soars: Epic in God's own Sight! 242. Great as thou wast, yet in thy life we learn Little to imitate and much to shun And nought to envy: Destiny is stern Yet just to spirits gifted thus to run A glorious race: the Coursers of the sun Are firehoofed, and to all Lands should bear The light of Truth: but if they fly not on Their heavenly path, their course is marked by fear, Their might is turned against them and their hearts doth sear! 243. He who would be the Giant of all Time, The Pioneer of dark Futurity, The Masterspirit of his age and clime, The Joshua whom Heaven stamps for high And holiest Efforts, must not fear to die Or suffer, for his Wreath of Glory is Oft but the martyrscrown: nay e'en a lie The sceptic World will name his life and hiss Him forth in scorn: Christ was betrayed too by its Kiss! 244. He who would vindicate unto himself This highest of all callings, let him think Well on his task: whether the power and pelf Of Earth do lure him not, for on the brink Of deep perdition stands he, and must sink If his Eye fails: with heart in Faith enshrined The Good Fight he must fight: for if he shrink, Its lofty Glories suit not such a mind: Let him turn back in haste some meaner goal to find! 245. All may not live as godlike Milton lived: And few are they indeed with will or power To walk in his bright steps: for Truth he strived, With his whole Heart and soul, and for her Dower He took her portionless, yet loved her more The more he learnt her worth, and for her sake Was scorned and persecuted: he died poor, But rich in Glory: for he would not take Reward from Man, which God alone could fitly make! 246. Oh Truth! how feeble are all words to sing Thy Giantworth, whose Atlasstrength can bear A World of Ills unmoved; tho' sufferings fling Their dark clouds o'er thee, or Fate's lightnings tear Thy Heart asunder, thou unawed canst hear With calm, untroubled Soul the World's loud Scorn Sorrow but makes thy pale, calm Brow more fair, More godlike, and of all thy Glories shorn, We own thce not of Earth, majestic, tho' forlorn! 247. Chained to thy Rock, with all Hate's hellish Crew Scoffing around, still on thy placid Brow The Sense of Immortality can strew Its Hallowing; Time cannot lay thee low, Debase, or alterâwith one calm Glance thou Canst force back Envy to his Hell, that Breast Which is the bitterest Dungeon he can know: Still mountainfirm, alone thou stand'st each Test, Tho' Tempests rage around, they shake not thy Soul's Rest! 248. Oh Truth, thy Service is the perfect, sole, And only Freedom; what tho' venomed Fate Sting like a serpent, when we reach the goal Are we not thine? and canst thou not create, E'en in the Whirlwind of man's petty hate, A Hope that tramples underfoot in scorn Time and his Nothingness? He has a date: Earth's base shall be as sand, the Heavens lightshorn, But when the sun is dark, shall break thy cloudless morn! 249. I turn from Truth to thee fair Switzerland, For thou art stamped with Truth and Liberty, And Fredom glows in every line I've scann'd Of thy bright features; of thy Mountains high It is the base immoveable, thy sky Is fresh and redolent of it, thine air Voices it in all sounds eternally: Not the soft Judaskiss with which the fair, Yet treacherous South betrays the wanton lips that share 250. Her fatal Beauty, lulling Mind and Heart Asleep, yet rousing Sense to Luxury, But stirring with its lusty Breath each Part Of life and soul to action, deeds as high As those of Murten's field, which memory Still hallows in the heartsof men for aye; Here Freedom sanctifies, and evernigh Her voice speaks from the rainbowed cataract's spray, Whence she smiles forth upon her sons, their Guardianfay 251. Wheree'er she treads upspring Fruit, Corn, and Grass. 'Neath her lifekindling step, her genial Power Clothes all the Land with beauty: she doth pass, And all grows Godlike, e'en the meanest flower Is fairer than elsewhere, when she breathes o'er And hallows it into an Emblem bright. And when Mont Blanc in storm and cloud doth lower. And lightnings wreath his icy brows with Light, Then looms her Giantform and thunders forth its might, 252. As she could punish if need were; what shrine, Or fitter temple for such Deity, Save the pure heart? the tempestvoices twine With hers their Giantechos, up the sky Booming as Heaven's far vault were rended by Their cry of exultation; o'er the Lake The windswept billows worship her, and high They laugh in flashing spray: the mountains wake In thunder, as her voice their inmost hearts could shake! 253. Farewell bright Land! and ye most glorious thoughts, Thy scenes have kindled in my feeble breast, Where Power is but Will's shadow, Truth exhorts My humble praise, and her most high behest, Like to the brooding Eagle on the Nest Rearing its feeble young unto the wing, Imparts a strength to weakness, and at rest Sets the wildthrobbing heart, for tho' I sing With earthborn Tones, my Theme would higher Echos thing! 254. Oh Virtue, with no coined and empty Name Of glozing Poesy I call on thee With bent knee and bowed heart, but as the flame That feeds the altar of the Deity, Whose fit shrine is the upright heart and free: For thou dwell'st only where the Temple's pure; And shielded by no fabled Egis he Who feels thee at his heart walks more secure Than Thetis'son, by God's own Hand protected sure! 255. Than Thetis'son! oh idle simily, Vain fancy coinÃ«d in a Poet's brain And nothingworth; no Fabledeity Gave thee to man, from no Olympus vain Thou comÃ«st; no! thy viewless flight is ta'en From the Midheavens, in man's heart alone Thou lov'st to dwell, for thou dost alldisdain A meaner Temple, marble or of stone, Being allboundless in the soul thou mak'st thine own! 256. On thee I call, as that which I have felt In my own breast, when from each fettering woe Of Earth setfree, in Spirit I have knelt Before my God, and with no idle show Of thoughtdividing words, apparel low Which the soul disembodied flings aside As lightning does the Cloud, have learnt to know That we have that within which shall abide Thro' Time, which from itself the soul in vain would hide! 257. Alas! what is man's life untaught by Thee! An empty breath that mingles with the Air, A bubble on a wave, or as may be A flame that fitful blasts make idly flare, Now lost in smoke, now wasting in false glare, Where thou art not his Hopes and Joys are blind, Like empty Chaff the mocking winds upbear, Whirled in a few brief eddies, then consigned Back to its native dust, therein fit home to find. 258. Did not the Prophet in the days of yore, When Faith had filled him with Divinity, Bid from the rock the living waters pour In the parched waste, to quench a far less high And holy thirst than that of Soul? then why May we not have like priviledge to wake In our own hearts, whose sources deeper lie Than the rock's deepest base, some springs to slake A heavenly thirst, and by their touch our Lips to make 259. Fit for the taste of bliss, of genuine bliss? But he, ye answer, was a prophet, one Who by Faith claims the glory which is his. Yea verily! but Faith for him alone Has not reserved her blessingsâlike the Sun She quickens all, and tho' we are not free To work such outward miracles, yet none But in their souls as Prophets still may be, And call the living waters forth unfailingly! 260. The least of miracles are those to sight And sense laid bare, with vulgar wonder fraught: But there are others, wrapt in deepest night To common apprehensions, which high thought Alone, that by the inner Light is taught, Can fitly comprehend: but these no place Find on the vulgar List, their deeds are wrought Within the soul, and leave no outward Trace Or Form, too vast to be comprized in Time and Space! 261. An ampler Field is theirs, a nobler aim And witness than men's Eyes, and as their Might From that which is eternal springs, the same Alone can measure them, from vulgar sight They are selfhid in beauty alltoobright. Brute strength of nerve and sinew men adore, In this have faith, weak wonder to its height By these is raised, they see, they touch, nor more Require, like the disbelieving one of yore. 262. The rest were purerthoughted far, for they Had Faith within the soul, and by the same They proved and measured Truth: lit by the ray That makes the unseen visible, they came To Faith's true shrine, and with her altarflame Their Senses and their Hearts were cleans'dâby high And holy Commune with that mighty Name Whose service they professed, their inner Eye Was allunfilm'd, and sense to them was mockery! 263. For he who has proved aught unto the Soul, What needs he prove it to the Hand or Eye? The higher Proof implies the less, the whole Contains the Partâand even if it by The Sight and Touch be proved, if inwardly There be no Faith what shall it profit? thro' The Heart alone it fruits: for still the high- Est Truths are found by Faith, who soars up to The Sky for them, and leaves slow Thought to prove them true. For she is still content to feel them so, And practicing them, best their Truth can know! 264. But he, lowthoughted Man! he needs must seek To prove in Space and Time, by sense's aid, The divine Truth, in him a presence weak And allbelied, if by sense firmer made, But he deemed idly, for his faith was dead, Else with his soul he might have touched and seen. His faith was in the shows of things, instead Of in their spirit, and he would have been An unsure Stay, still wavering Sense and Soul between! 265. And he was of the world, the world of him, As his Belief so its: illunderstood Are these high truths, which ask an Eye not dim, A Mind which labours for that chiefest good, That source of each high thought and blessed mood, A Conscience seeking for its own rewards And its own motives: drawing its best food From the decay of things whose Weight retards Our upward flight, and in the soul its Essence guards 266. 'Till we return unto that blessed place Where all things shall be truly what they seem In their own Nature, free from every Trace Of the world's hollow glitter, by Truth's beam Stripped of all false presentments: from life's dream The soul shall wake to live as heretofore, When all this passing coil of Time, this stream Of noise and nothingness, and vain uproar, Lost in Eternity's calm depths, is heard no more! 267. Thriceblessed Place! whence dimeyed Fear and Doubt, Despair and Hope, with all their idle train Of earthborn cares and sorrows are shut out. Where Joy, on Earth a fleeting shadow vain, Still leading in one hand her sister, Pain, While with the other she unlocks the Door Of dim Delights, that vanish as we strain Them to our aching Hearts, here in her power And Substance marks with Light, not shade each passing hour! 268. And now divinest Poesy, to thee With lingering Voice I turn and parting sigh, For in thy service have I kept me free From all soulsoiling Contactâby thy high And holy commune have I tuned my Eye And Ear to fitting Instruments to aid The Soul within, that so the harmony And blessÃ«d calm of Nature might be made Moods of my own deep Heart, and not a vain parade. 269. Oft have I sought thee, when the Moonbeams shed Their magic on some haunted woodlandbrook Falling with chequered Light, while overhead Softkissing Boughs were intertwined, scarce shook By the leafcreeping winds, by silence took Allunawares, and to a whisper hushed: Beneath, the stream glid thro' a woody nook, Bathing the twisted roots, which downward push'd Snakelike into the wave, that noiseless past them rush'd 270. Over thickbedded moss, kept sweet and cool, And sunbeam proof by many a Perfumebough, Whose feathery Sprays danced on the glassy pool, And many a wavekissing flower too Which gave its Odor to the stream below In gratitude; thick bunchÃ«d Dayseyes shed, Like Earthstars, a faint Light, and violets grew In such sweet Clusters 'twere a shame to tread, Save barefoot, on their blue like heaven's overhead. 271. Silvering the darkness, cradled boyantly On the deep stream, in broadleaved amplitude, Fresh Waterlilies, where quick Eddies ply Their noiseless sport, in lustrous Light did brood, Like Waterqueens, in sacred solitude. The Arrowhead sway'd by the sof breath'd Air Bent to the gentle whisper of the flood, And ever from some mossy Banksidelair, With sudden, waveward plunge the Frog would dis appear. 272. And on all sides the lushgrown Eglantine, From out the Matgrass and the dewbent Flower, Its Tendrils, like loveknots, did ever twine Round the old, mossy boughs: a Fairybower Of Beauty, whose sweet scents did overpower The blissteeped Senses, 'till it seemed to be A harbour of delight at that soft hour Of balm and blessedness, where spirits free From mortal Interruption might hold revelry! 273. And as I stepped from out the calm Moonlight Into the mossy shade, as still as Thought, For my own footsteps fell so soft they might Scarce by the quickeared Squirrel's self be caught, Swinging from Branch to Branch, the Groveseem'd fraught With bodiless Sounds of sweetest melody; Now single, now in Pairs and Gushes, brought Back by the Echos as they seemed to die, In a full, choral Burst of streamlike Minstrelsy, 274. Such as one fancies in some rapturous Dream; Now 'twas a zigzag Twitter 'long the Ground, A Vein of Music, like a broken Beam Of Moonlight, shaking the Dewdrops: now round From every Bough it poured, a shower of sound, Soft notes like Aprilraindrops splashing down From Leaf to Leaf, now silence, still, profound Crept on returning winds whose breath had blown That Music far abroad, like scents from Flowers thrown! 275. The Sweetness of o'ergushing Joy, which breaks Forth in heartunÃ«d Notes, high minstrelsy! Deeper than any that Man's touch awakes, Than all, save that which oft unsought doth lie In his own soul, a kindred Melody, Known but to him who well has learnt to tune The Spirit's Stringsâand here, sweet Poesy, While Sleep's Lethean Dew fell'neath the Moon, Sealing up weary Sense, I sought thy priceless boon. 276. And oft I fancied that thy Hand did weave Old Melodies and touched the antique Strings Of its own Delphic Harp, and waked to grieve, Like one to whom Mortality still clings, Dulling him with the Sense of earthly Things. And oft methought from out thy cavehid Cell Some Straynote, borne upon the Zephyr's Wings, Hath won my Ear, a note of thy sweet shell, And by it oft I hoped to find where thou didst dwell. 277. But when I reached the spot from whence it came At my unhallowed step the music fled, (Like Hope's bright dreams,) far off, yet still the same. Sweet Poesy had flown, and in her stead Her Sister, Solitude, the Silent, led Me thro' her solemn haunts, a bootless chace, 'Mid Tanglecopse with Woodflowers 'neath them spread, And lushgrown creepers covering all the place, A moonbeamhaunted Spot, where Man had left no trace! 278. And save the Nestbirds that with glittering Eye From their boughcradled Homes, yet without fear, Peered underleaf at us as we passed by, Shaking the dewpearls which hung silverclear In the calm Light, for Man had seldom there Marred the blest Quiet, all beside was still. I cried aloud, and Echo far and near Gave answer, mocking from each cave and hill, Thereat my guide was scared and left me to my will, 279. E'en from my boyish Days the Echo's voice To me had been a spirit's; far away To her wild Converse from all vulgar Noise Unconsciously I stole, and loved to stray With her o'er every spot where Legends gray And old Traditions, lulled by Time asleep, In Nature's Bosom rest, yet living aye In her eternal Elements, as deep As the Rock's base, 'mid which their charmÃ«d rest they keep! 280. And often as I called, sweet Eldtimesongs, Made sweeter by the Lapse of many Years, That spell which to old things alone belongs, The beauty of departed hopes and fears, Which with them entering our hearts bring tears Of Joy, high Fancies, and high Memories, Until the Ear forgotten voices hears, And glorious forms of Eld before our Eyes, Thus quickened, in bright Casque and waving Plumes arise! 281. Yea! often as I called and Echo spake, The Universal Heart has sent to mine That Impulse high by which ourselves we make Portions of Nature's self, and grow divine, Being likest then to spirits: for we twine Our souls into the web of sympathies, The mighty web all Times have wove, and shine Like stars 'bove this dim Earthâthe mysteries Of Being are revealed, Glimpses of purer skies 282. Are given us, and in the Life of things We dwell awhile, breathing a purer Air: And hear the rustle of celestial wings, And Angels breathe upon our Lips, and fair And sunny forms float past us 'till we are O'erpowered by their presence and sink down In a rich sleep, and waking where we were, Deem all a splendid Vision, briefly shown, Like sunsetcloudscenes lost: yet more of Life is known 283. In these bright visions, fleeting as they seem, Than in the commonplace realities Of an whole weekdaylife, on which no beam Of light celestial falls: Man lives and dies, But for such visitations, like the flies That in the sunbeam dance, and know not why Or how their Maker fashiond them: too wise To deem that there can be reality Save in these outward forms, the thrall of Sense and Eye 284. And as these Echos died, like closing Tones Of eldtime songs that fall asleep again In Nature's Bosom, 'mid the dust and bones Of those who framed, and framed them not in vain, For in those songs, like floating souls, have lain The Spirit and the Glory of old Days, And our forefathers' voices join the strain Their childrensehildren sing, and bid them raise On the old Faith those works which Time can ne'er deface! 285. Oh! as those Echos died, my youthful dreams Came on me once again, but something more Than Boyhood ever felt was in them, gleams Of supernatural Beauty and of Power, High Instincts, and high Feelings, that before In the soul's depths had stept, as in Earth lie The forms of Glory waiting but the hour That bids them be: I felt that from my Eye The earthly film had passed, that spirits wandered nigh! 286. Again I spake: 'twas not the Echo's Tongue, That soft, yet clearbackanswering, on my Ear Came with its hidden meanings, with a throng Of divine hopes, and with a holy fear, Such as he haply feels who from the bier Has heard an angel's voice that says, Â«ariseÂ»! 'Twas Nature's mighty self in accents clear Speaking to her own child, and Poesy's Sweet Voice with hers was knit in blended harmonies! 287. And is it thus, I cried, then ye are one And indivisible, and I have found Ye both at once when seeking one alone! Yea! even so. and man may search around The Universe for that which doth abound On everyside, yet surely search in vain, If he disjoin what God in one has bound: Thus Joy ne'er comes but with his shadow Pain, And the bright Rainbow smiles but 'mid the sunlit rain! 288. Twinborn with Nature, Poesy, art thou, An universal soul! like heaven's Light, Thou fallest on all things yet few do know How to reveal thy glories to the sight, Or bid thee be: thou comÃ«st with the Night And all her thousand stars, and with the wind Thy harmonies are wove, and on the bright And sunlit wave thy airlight track we find, That in its swiftness leaves the Zephyr's self behind. 289. Thou dwellÃ«st in all things, thy spell is blent With flower and forest: oft at Eventide Thou buildest for thyself a gorgeous tent 'Mid the Sunclouds: then scatterest far and wide With the wind's trumpet, shapes on everyside Of fancybaffling beauty, such as make The Poet's dreams a mockery, his pride Mere Ignorance! oft when the stormwaves break, Thou Danger's Playmate on the Shore thy stand dost take 290. Thou lingerest with a deep, soulthrilling spell Among the mossy Graves and Ruins hoar, Where gray Tradition her old Tales doth tell, Sitting, like aged Crone, 'mid things of yore: Echos of which in broken snatches pour From her old, mombling Tongue: in the child's Eye And Laugh thou hast Â«a prone and speechless LoreÂ», And 'mid the haunts of Youth and Home dost lie, With something deeper, dearer still, than Poesy! 291. Oft, when the Moonbeam silvers o'er the spray Of some rock leaping cataract, thy low, Soft undervoice is mingling its sweet Lay With the wild Waters' music, as they flow In bright Foamflakes into the Gulf below, Where 'mid the windstirred Trees thou sitt'st alone, Soft moonlight falling on thy pensive Brow, And tun'st thine Ear to Nature's faultless tone, Still modulating by her changeful Lyre thine own. 292. Thou dwellest in our souls, in youth we bring Thee fresh from Heaven with us: on our sight And sense thy glorious spell thou then dost fling, And all we see is beauty: Heaven's Light Is in our Eyes, we breathe its breath, and bright The common Earth lies lovely as a Dream: But soon these precious powers sin doth blight, The outward sense they leave, each vital Gleam Sinks back into the soul, and gone for aye they seem. 293. Thou dwellest in all forms, and Poets old, Whose Lore came fresh from Nature's living book, This high Truth emblemed when their sweet verse told How Pegasus from out the living rock With sky descending Hoof the Waters struck: The Poetrill, which to these later Days From that old fount has flowed, a songsweet Brook: 'Neath every soil and clime the Fountain plays, But to the chosen foot alone its place betrays! 294. Alas! how few are they, the chosen few, Who in the life of things may dwell and see The veil withdrawn, which from our meaner view Hideth the Glory and the Mistery! 'Tis in the inmost shrine the Presence high Of Nature dwells, and there her Priest alone May dare to tread, on whom the Deity Has set his seal: no other will she own, To them her Lips are sealed, and answer has she none! 295. If then thy Gifts, fair Maid, be not for me, If to a lower sphere my soul must bow, And dwell in forms which everyday we see: Yet e'en o'er these a high content can throw The shadow of a Glory which doth flow From lofty feelings breathed in word and deed Into life's week day-forms: yea even so, From Failure's self may spring Content's true seed, And Love than what he sees no wider World can need! 296. My song is sung: alas! but ill I fear, A feeble Echo of a noble theme From strings illfitted such high strains to bear: My Heart aches, for I once did fondly dream In the first gush of youth, when fancies teem And Hope is all he pleases, that I might Write something which at least in part should seem Not of this Earth all earthly: but those bright And dazzling hopes are lost, like Mornsmists to the sight. 297. And harsh Reality with look of scorn Points to the glowing spot which Fancy's Beam Had clothed with glory, now of Beauty shorn, Cold, dull, as pleasures past, a barren dream! Alas! in youth we are not what we deem, We know not ourownselves, tho' in the might Of untried aspirations it might seem An easy task to wing on high our flight E'en to the fount of Truth, and wreath our brows with Light! 298. Like some benificent Deity, we would Stretch forth our hands to bless the Earth and pour The Plentyhorn of all things fair and good Upon the favored Land whose Bosom bore Our Fathersfathers; we would tread no more Dull Custom's hackney'd Round, but rise like those, The Great of Old, unto that starry Lore, Which still the End and the Beginning knows, And teaches us a God's majestic, calm, Repose! 299. Alas! into the List of common men How soon we sink! this is no Atmosphere For Angelswings to soar in; even when The Laurelcrown is won, how soon 'tis sere, How soon it leaves our brows to mock our bier! And they who live upon the breath of Fame, Find it no Ether, but, like all things here, With Disappointment mixed, that of a Name The Glory and the Nothingness are near the same! 300. How often with a bitter sigh we wake From Hope's bright Dreams and to Reality Reluctant turn! how sadly do we take The first, stern Lesson taught our young hearts by The cold Lip of Experience! when nigh Our hands to Glory's Garland, lo! 'tis gone: And for the Manna of sweet Poesy By Angels brought us, we must live upon The coarse, hard, scanty bread of weekday Life alone! 301. And I, I too, have had my youthful dreams, In which Fame, smiling, placed upon my brow Her neverfading Wreath, and in the beams Of a diviner Day I lived; but now Alas! 'twould seem but as an idle show E'en if I had it, for all those are gone Who made this life endurable: below The Churchyardturf some sleep, and some are grown Estranged, that worst of deaths, and I am left alone, 302. A blighted tree, which in the springtide of The year puts forth no Leaves, but bare and sere When Buds are bursting on each bough and love Attunes to all sweet things the Eye and Ear, A sad memorial of Winter drear: My Heart is old, tho' time hath strewn no gray Upon my head, and oft the unbidden Tear, When none are by to mock, will force its way: But sixty Beats to each dull hour of the Day. 303. It was not so, and still at times I pass On Faith's bold wings from all these mockeries, These passing shadows vain, and (even as The Angels upon Jacob's ladder) rise Beyond this Earth, 'till lost amid the skies, From Truth to Truth ascending gradual Along the mighty scale, 'till to my Eyes God's secrets stand revealed, each spring of all The vast machinery that moves both great and small, 304. Even to where Eternal Wisdom binds The last Link of the allembracing chain Of Truth to God's firm Throne: that Chain which winds Round the whole Universe, framed to retain The Seas and Mountains, as the least Sandgrain, With equal ease in their appointed spheres; From whence all Efforts of all Strength were vain One Atom to displaceâTime leads the Years, Like Ghosts, each at his Bidding comes and disappears! 305. Moment begeteth Moment, and no power Can sunder the invisible, light Link, The fateforged, which connects them, far, far more Binding than Adamant: 'tis vain to shrink, One with another to the fatal brink They drag us irresistibly; we see The precipice, we feel that we must sink: A few short seconds, and then we shall be Lost in the foam and thunder of the eternal sea! 306. Who that the Manna of celestial thought E'er tasted but has seen some Vision high, In which his spirit, from this dull Earth caught, Seemed to o'erlook some Promiseland, whose sky Shone o'er Truth's harvests, ripening goldenly: Alas! but few may enter that fair Land And reap the thoughts that wither not nor die, Yet gleanerlike the tempting Field I've scanned Seeking some remnant still, o'erlooked by nobler hand! 307. And I should deem my humble search o'erpaid By a few grains of Truth, that, like the pure And furnacetested Gold, might still be weighed And not found wanting; for if slow, but sure Man to the hive of Knowledge may secure Some small, yet true additions, it is all That Hope can grasp at: for the hive is poor E'en 'mid its boasted wealth, whereof but small And scanty portions from Truth's honeybees do fall! 308. And there are many drones who labour not, But steal from out the hive its sweet supply To feed their Idlenessâ there are who plot How they may turn God's Truth into a Lie, Changing Man's Worship to Idolatry Of foul and monstrous Substitutes, that spread The breath of Desolation far and nigh: Filling the World with Strife and Sin instead Of holy Peace and Love, whereof true hearts are bred! 309. For the World loves the darklywoven Lie, The gilded Falsehood: Wealth, Pride, Pleasure, Power Divide Men's Hearts with varied Mastery: But Truth is portionless, and brings no dower Save her ownself; and as within the Flower The Bee alone knows where the honey lies, And how to gather it, so her sweet Lore Is for the Heart that seeks her noblest prize, The selfreward she brings, and for her lives and dies. 310. Heartsearcher, thou, thou know'st if I speak true, And tho' my verse be allunworthy thee, Yet have I sought thy honor, with the few, The wiser few, who deem it bliss to be Thy meanest Instrument: for what is free, If not thy service? but alas! I dare Not deem thy Praise fit task for such as me; Had I a thousand Tongues, and each Tongue were Asan whole Nation's Voice, the mighty Winds should bear, 311. As on four Wings, my Words thro' all the Earth, Filling the Universe with that one Name, 'Till Seas and Mountains in their holy mirth, As if an Earthquake stirred them, should exclaim, Joining the universal shout, the same That shook the Hills upon Creation's dawn, Voicing the Lord of Hosts! if aught of blame Be in my Verse, or of due glory shorn That Name, not His, but mine be all the Critic's scorn. 312. Farewell is but a Word of Earth, for things, For Hopes and Fears which here are born here die, But to truetempered Hearts no sorrow brings, For such still hope to meet above the Sky, Where grief is not, nor dull tear dims the Eye: But Reader, fare thou well, once more I say, In its true sense, fare well eternally; And to do so what more is needful pray Than to take each step right, Steps make the longest Way! 313. Live to thy God, and if in that high Race Men crown thee, be not vain thereat, look on It but as Homage due to Himâ His Praise Is likewise thine, if thou serv'st Him alone! Long Life is none, if tangled or illspun The Web: if otherwise, end when it will, It must end well: should Men thy merits own 'Tis good, yet praise may Virtue slack or kill, If not, thou losest naught, the substance is thine still! 314. And now, O God! a humble Prayer I make With bended knee, and lip that to a Lie Lends not its Utterance, that for his sake Who came on Earth a traitor's death to die, Thou with thy Grace wouldst please to fructify, E'en in this humble Soil, such Seeds of good As Faith may have imparted from on high: Tho' least among thy least, yet have I stood Firm to the Cause I love, and wrought as best I could 315. And oh! my Country, if at Times there be A Bitterness, and something e'en of Scorn Mixed with my Verse when it would speak of thee, 'Tis but Excess of Love from whence is born My Anger, for I would not see the shorn Of one least Ray of Glory on thy Brow. Like to the Watcher waiting for the Dawn, So watch I for thy welfare: and when thou Awak'st, then will I close mine Eyes forlorn For the long Sleep, and Dreams sublime shall show What may not bless my sight before I go! Geneva, August 1833. GENIUS A SERIES OF THOUGHTS 1 The Bread of Immortality is earn'd If not with sweat of the earthbended brow, Yet still with sore Soultravail, and is turned To bane if taken carnally: when no Celestial Leaven of high hopes, that know No base alloy, is mixed therewith to make It Git food for those pure lips whence should flow Truth's blessed accents: for its own sole sake We must seek for it, and no earthly wages take! 2 Oh! miserable Man! who sets a price On divine things and estimates them by Silver and Gold, like vulgar merchandice: And who can work out with their agency Only the Perishable, which must die With him and leave no during trace behind! Who hides the divine radiance of the sky Beneath the bushel, that upon his blind Molepaths its selfish light may shine, not on mankind! 3 Go ask the Grave why o'er the sublime brow Of Genius, cut down like a Summerflower, The hand of cold neglect so oft doth throw Th' untimely Earth? Go, ask it if the dower Of a toofeeling heart be not a poor Breastplate against the shafts of Calumny? 'Tis but the Intoxication of an hour, In which we drink Ambrosia from the sky, Then reach the bitter dregs that at the bottom lie! 4 Go! call, in Santa Croce, on the Shade Of the great Florentine, and ask him whom Here is an Allusion to M. Angelo's calling the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, his Spouse. perhaps he did so merely on account of what he deemed its great Beauty: perhaps he may have felt something of what I have here attempted feebly to express: the Tearning after something unpossessed and unpossessable, which is to Genius at once the inspiring Wine in Life's Cup, and the bitter Dregs at its Bottom. He chose unto his Bride: was his Heart made Less than the Herd's for Love, or sought he some More heavenly Spouse, no Subject of the Tomb, Whose Beauty Worm defaces not: and who Might make him Father by her divine Womb Of an enduring Offspring, firm and true To that calm, serene Love which changes not its hue 5 Like earthly passion, which lights up the Eye With a false, feverish fire, and then dies Out in its own vile ashes, smothered by The snows of age: mixed aye with bitter sighs For the lost Â«BeautifulÂ», which to our eyes The jealous Earth restores not! not such Love His divine Bride bore him, nor such the Ties, Which knit in Youth, in Age remained unwove: But breathing one same life, all Chance and Change above! 6 And when his head grew grey, still by his side She stood, more lovely than in those fresh years Of Hope and pure Delight, when as his Bride He plighted her his Faith: the bitter tears Shed in wardly for ills the proud soul bears In silence, and the smileless lip, whereon Is throned the calm scorn of the Envier's sneers, These did she compensate: she who alone Had felt his last Heartbeat, still answering her own! 7 Go, wake Domenichino from that rest Which in this life he found not: ask him why The grave affords the weary head its best And softest pillow; and tho' now his eye Be filled with calm light of Eternity And he can look back with untroubled brow On the pale, quivering lip, and smothered sigh, Yet with a bitter smile he'll tell thee how Much vile dust on Fame's laurels Envy's hand can throw! 8 Oh! feelingly, with Eloquence supplied By griefs that found no voice, will he relate Of the stern struggles 'twixt th' Immortal's pride And the man's frailties: struggles to create The blessed calmness of a better State 'Mid the vain fret and fever of this Life: Of Evil tongues, and that unwearied Hate Which dogged his steps, and with its noise and strife Disturbed him in the arms e'en of his divine Wife! 9 He'll tell thee sublime Genius, oft by The paltry standard of vile custom tried And comprehended not, must learn to ply His task like the despisÃ«d daydrudge: hide His tears of holy Joy, and dwarf his stride To the world's pace, for if his Tongue betrays The secret of his heart, or if his wide And ample ken o'erlooks the World's dull ways, Then in a Madhouse he may chance to end his days! 10 If with th' Allmeasure of enduring Thought And fearless Truth he make his estimate, And not with that by which all things are bought And sold, yea, e'en the holiest: if he rate Forms, Customs, Modes, at their legitimate Intrinsic Worth, not by the Threefootrule Employed in Life's vile traffic, he must wait 'Till Time rear up disciples for his school, And make the sage revered once bray'd at as a Fool! 11 He'll speak of toil requited not, save by The still, small, Voice, that whispered in his ear, Not to the sensual organ but that high And serene faculty which still can hear Communications from that higher sphere From whence 'tis severed, like the Oceanshell: That Voice, which warned him that all glory here Is but a shadowsshade: that in its cell The Soul, as in a holy Hermitage, should dwell 12 On Contemplation's heights, far from the crowd And all its passing uproar: breathing there Of a diviner Element, by cloud And mists of Earthliness, by Passion, Care, And Prejudice undimm'd: and seeking, (where Alone 'tis found) within the inmost Shrine, The perfect Beauty, which the Soul doth bear With it from Heav'n, an heritage divine: That Jewel which no impure passion's breath should tine 13 In whose clear surface, as it lies enchas'd In the Heartsdepths, we see the Ether blue, Celestial Mansions, and bright Angels placed Around God's throne: thus learning to renew The memory of Glories which we knew In happier climes: that perfect Beauty here Felt consciously but by the chosen few, Who in calm selfcontentedness, by fear, And vain doubts unperplexed, draw now the Atmosphere, 14 In long, full, draughts of Immortality: No tumult in the beatings of the heart, No feverish Passion in the quiet eye, But that foretasting Faith, which can impart Unto Life's troublous pulse, by divine Art, The blessed calmness of Eternity; Until we stand, as in a dream, apart From the vile passions which around us ply Their tasks, then wake and find our dream Reality! 15 Behold the Poet kneeling at the Shrine Of Truth, receiving the Communionbread Of Immortality, the Cup divine, Which shall pour Ichor thro 'his veins instead Of this dull blood; behold him too when wed To the sole Bride his arms should e'er embrace, The Helen of chaste Art, whose form has fed His 'midnight visions, and whose radiant face, Leaning above his pillow in its divine Grace, 16 Hath pressed on his young lips a holy kiss, A nuptial kiss, and sweetened them to speak In accents worthy of the realms of bliss; Oh! let him keep his plighted Faith and seek No meaner mistress, for if once so weak As to renew his kindred with Decay, His Fault will gnaw with selfavenging Beak, In shame and sorrow shall he turn away, He clasps her to his Heart, and finds her common clay! 17 Better that from the Muse's divine breast Her Fosterchild were pluck'd by hands unkind- Ly kind away, ere he have lost all zest For pleasures wherein simple mortals find Life's crowning charm; that milk was not design'd For lips that kiss the Beauty of Decay, And they who're nursed on its are 'mong the Blind Like men who with a microscope survey The coarse and homely features of this poor, dull clay! 18 Oh! let him cleave unto his divine Bride, On her calm Bosom let him lay his head, Rejoicing still that he has nought to hide From her high Scrutiny; he must be dead To sensual passion, alletherealized, Ere Commune with her he can hold or reap The Joys of that chaste Wedlock, which instead Of the parch'd, throbbing brow, and feverish sleep, Shall yield him holy raptures, lasting, calm, and deep! 19 Aye, Raptures deep and inexhaustible As is the Soul itself, pure Joys that flow Unceasingly from out the living well Whence Milton's lips derived their sacred glow; Far sweeter than famed Castaly, altho' That too gush'd from the universal heart Of Nature at the Pegasean blow, One of those veins which run thro' every part, Traced but by the Diviningrod of heavenly Art! 20 Which in a Homer's or a Shakespear's Hand Can open up perennial founts of song, Poured like a Nile, thro' all the mighty Land Of Thought, to fertilize; and while along It flows on its eternal course, in strong Yet calm, majestic tide, as in a dream, Cities and Empires, and the idle gleam Of worldly Pomps pass from its banks, and seem No more than fleeting shadows mirrored briefly in the stream! 21 Then let him cleave unto his Bride; for oh! If once estranged from her, into what Breast Shall he pour forth the secret of his woe? Where look for Solace? doth he not divest Himself of vulgar sympathies, and rest His hopes and fears upon a nobler base? Then who can comprehend him, save this best And only friend; tho' in the selfsame place And the same air men breathe, they're of a different race! 22 A wide gulf gapes between them, and with him They can have no Communion: his ways Are unaccountable, his Joys, a whim! Yea! the celestial smile, whose beauty plays About his lips, that with its holy rays Lights up the glistening eye, as tho 'he saw Some Angel floating in the sunsetsblaze, Is mockery to those who 'mid the war Of Earth's vile passions fret, and squabble for a straw! 23 He who has looked into the life of things, How can he toil for Mammon's wages, play A Part on Life's dull stage, on Fancy's Wings Is he not ever soaring far away, Up towards the source of that diviner day In which his Spirit breathes? yet, oh! e'en there, When almost out of sight, the feeble clay Reminds him whence he rose into that Air, And that, once more on Earth, his neck must bend and wear 24 The galling yoke of Custom, like the least Of those who in her dusty wheeltrack plod, Scarce conscious of one thought above the beast; Yea! even there, e'en when into the God Expanding, from Mortality's dull load Set free, the voice of Envy shall arise, And reaching him, shrink up the growing God Into the common man, and from the skies Hurl him, like fallen Angel, 'mid the Jeers and Cries 25 Of the exulting Herd: if not, 'tmay be, Like them to grovel in the dust, yet still To feel himself akin to that which he Had thought to cast aside: to feel his will All powerless the bitter Truth to kill Or stifle, ever ringing in his ears, That they who at the Muse's bosom fill Their veins, are beings of two different Spheres, That in the Man's scant breast that milk a God uprears! 26 And that as he expands and fills this frame, His narrow tenement, it wastes away, An unfit vessel for the mighty flame That burns within, which with its intense ray Consumes the perishable lamp of Clay; While in the common breast it lingers on Down to the very socket, 'till Decay Extinguish it and then at once are done The faint, cold, flickering light, and that it fed upon! 27 Oh! many Ills wait on him who would tread The paths of Fame, ere to that upperair Where her high temple stands, his steps are led By him who only gains admittance there, Merit! who here below must often wear The garb of Undesert, oft toil and sweat For years in some forgotten corner, where 'Mid rags and poverty the divine heat Breaks forth to light a world, from its despised retreat! 28 Abroad at random Nature casts the seed, And not in Princes' smiles alone it grows, Nor rules and learned Academies doth need; For to Prescription Genius never bows His sublime mind, but to himself still owes Reward and motive; from the living well Within the heart the divine Impulse flows, And those who have it not might hope as well The same, as without Faith to work a miracle! 29 Then place the masterpieces of all art Before the dull, uncomprehendig eye, The Eye of prose; think ye they will impart To such a clue unto the mystery? Alas the sÃ«er and the seen must by A divine Sympathy be but as one, In his own soul the counterpart must lie, Reflected clear, of that he looks upon, 'Tis nothing in itself, he makes it, he alone! 30 Yes, like Pygmalion he must embrace The Statue, from the inmost soul must pour Life into 'it, till mantling on the face The sentiment, unfelt, unseen before Grows visible, and with a holy Lore The lips, erst cold and still, to him be fraught; Then a dead Statue shall it seem no more, But like himself, by holy passion wrought To sympathy, the Beautiful, which he had sought! 31 The Muses have their home in our own heart: Thence are their Oracles, and pompous schools, With terms and phrase precise, may mark and chart The road, with all appliances and tools Needful thereto: and in the hands of fools Place them, that likest mere machines they may Measure an Helen's face, and fix by Rules The Beautiful which turns in scorn away Without one divine smile: unfelt, unknown, for aye! 32 In vain, in vain: by rules must they abide, Within the Ellwand shall their Empire lie, And never beyond that into the wide And ample realm, yea, up to the blue sky, And to its purest Ether, where hard by God's throne Urania sits, and Fancy's wing Ascends sometimes, shall they one step e'er try, Their Lyre shall own not one celestial string, Nor from the Spheres one Echo draw, backanswering! 33 This know they: and the knowledge to their hate Adds sting aud venom, therefore when in some DespisÃ«d Nazareth, of low Estate And far from Fortune' smiles, the Muse a home Hath chosen for the favored one on whom She heaps her divine gifts: and when she leads Him forth, like Genius risen from the tomb, The Doubters to convince, his presence breeds Dismay and palelipped Fear, and wrinkled Custom reads 34 In every face of all her motley crew Tokens of downfall, and the wormeat throne She sits on shakes beneath her at these new Signs of Revolt, which threaten to build on The ruins of her Power a nobler one, A loftier Dynasty, supported by Pure Truth and Merit's right divine alone: Then forth from her dark haunts doth Envy fly With all her broods, begot on Mediocrity! 35 The manytonguÃ«d Slander, full of Ears And Eyes, with scowling Malice, and sly Hate Coiling about the object which he fears, Snakelike, and squinteyed Prejudice, fit mate To doting Form who on his chair of State, Like an old cripple sits, for aye in one Same stiffening posture from time out of date! Thro' all the realms of Dullness fear doth run, Like Bats, when broken in on by the middaysun! 36 With these foes must he strive, and many more, For the World loves not to be made more wise, Or have its Idols broken: and before A new Creed can count many votaries, Or Admiration dares to canonize Its founder as a Saint, the chances are That he in Shame and Ignominy dies: And they who lift Truth's veil quite up and bare Her face too suddenly, had better first prepare 37 The poor worms it must shine on, lest they be Struck blind and in their fury mar and break The Beautiful, which they no longer see: In uncongenial pursuits, that make His sublime wings to flag when they would shake Earth's dust aside and soar into the sky, Oft must he toil, oft for the bodyssake Sweat for the bitter bread of Poverty: And that worst Ill of all, his better self belie! 38 Tho' Nature lays her irresistible Strong hand upon him and points out the way, Teaching him how to work some miracle Of Art with any object that chance may Supply him with, a bit of Chalk or Clay, To put to shame professors and their schools: Yet Genius vainly will his power display To men whose every heartpulse Mammon rules, His sublime task in their esteem is but the fool's! 39 Tis beautiful to give the heart, the whole And undivided heart, without one thought Save of their divine service and the goal, A godlike boon unto the Muses, naught Seeking nor wishing save the pleasure caught From their calm smiles: but oh! 'tis bitter Woe To desecrate a heart which they have brought Up and have purified: to let Earth's low Vile passions dim the glory gathering on the Brow! 40 Behold the wreath from Guido's temples fade, And paling in the eye, its divine fire Flashes but faintly thro' the thickening shade, The film, thro' which the forms of pure desire, Which erst upon his canvass would respire, Grow indistinct and dim, no more he sees Them floating past nor hears the heavenly Quire: His divine Art no more hath power to please, And in his famous hand the sublime pulse doth freeze: 41 For no more from the inmost heart the blood Sent from its purest vein hath strength to flow, And she who erst, unseen, beside him stood, The fair inspiring angel, whispering low With divine accents at his ear, is now Mourning in her own Ether o'er his fall: He hears her not: to shame and sin and woe He 's sold himself, and like a wretched thrall, For Bread and Hire toils, not at her divine call! 42 See godlike Vinci like a vile daydrudge Receive his wages: see the man of Prose, Who paltry as the sum is yet would grudge A mite for such an object, for he knows No value but by Gold, see how he throws The money down, as if he had to pay A tradesman's bill to whom his master owes Some trifle, doling out, with much delay, The last vile mite, as if he thought it thrown away: 43 And 'twixt his teeth he muttered as they fell, Â«And all this for a pictureÂ»! Â«curse the race, I wish they were all sent to paint in HellÂ»: Methinks I see that more than mortal face, That brow, which well old Homer's Jove would grace, The calm eye looking thro' you, and the thought Which over all hath left its sublime trace: The arching eyebrow, and the whole so wrought As Nature for the soul therein an emblem sought! 44 Methinks I see those noble features give Way to their sublime wrath: not like that we Frail mortals feel, with which we vainly strive, O'ermastering us in our Impotency, Like fretful Infants: not such wrath felt he, But divine Indignation, like a God: As if it were the price of Infamy, He flung the gold to Earth, and on it trod, For this I paint not said he and away he strode! 45 The noble Spirit in its anger grows More godlike: from its very Purity, Its Depth and Strength, its Indignation flows. And as the Ocean, tho' tossed wild and high, Preserves the Clearness of his Waters, by No Sediment polluted, thus below The Surface. from their Depth, their Souls still lie Calm, strong and clear: but shallow Natures throw Their Baseness to the surface, stirred by Passions low. 46 Thus Jove might hurl a thunderbolt, and so Back to his own vile dust the worm was thrown, Astonished yet not knowing why or how. Those sublime words to him were as a Tone, A Voice from other spheres, that with his own Held no Communion: but for that day And its proud triomph Vinci must atone; He who Art's sceptre like a king would sway, Must rule o'er other subjects than these Hearts of clay 47 These sublime Notions, which uphold the throne Of Art and give it an enduring base, And which can cherish and maintain alone The holy Fire burning, find no place In vulgar minds, impervious tho' the face Of the bright Muse herself on them should shine: To such Art is a trade, and they debase It to their level, 'till no more divine, It serves but to supply the mouth with Bread and Wine! 48 Their souls have no celestial thirst, and on Their earthly Lips Ambrosia's self would taste Just like the muddy draughts they dote upon. And their arms, if by such the Muse's chaste And radiant form could ever be embraced, Would clasp her like a shape of common clay. By these a price on heavenly things is placed, And their far worse than Gothic Hands they lay On God's own Image, bartering it for Gold away! 49 See him then forced his country to forsake, Because his sublime Spirit could not bear For divine things the dol'd out hire to take As for some paltry Merchandice: see where On Milan's Walls he labours, raising there That Work wherein a whole Life's Treasures blend, Which in itself is as a School of rare Instruction, teaching both Art's Mean and End, How that and Nature fresh charms to eachother lend! 50 Yet even there the Pedant and the Fool With Custom's Microscope would criticize, Measuring the Giant with their twelveinchrule: And much of favor lost he in their Eyes, Because his work did not with due speed rise, Like to the Bricklayer's, so much in each Day! Poor fools! who know not that the Soul supplies To the brute hand the power to array Its thoughts in visible forms, else but a Lump of Clay! 51 See Brunelleschi from the Councilhall Thrust like a fool, because he was not one, Behold him from that Elevation fall To which his Genius raised him, and atone By Shame and Insult because he alone Could comprehend the thoughts of his own mind. So perilous in this World to make known The truths which prove most precious to Man kind, The Torch which lights at last, at first is sure to blind! 52 And lo! Correggio, bent down beneath His hardearned Gold, the grudged and paltry Hire, Not worth one least Leaf of that fadeless Wreath That shades his Brows: behold him sweat and tire Correggio was paid a sum of 60 Goldcrowns for a Picture, but all in Copperpieces: in carrying it home he overheated himself, and taking a Colddrink, brought on a fever of which he died. 'Neath Mammon's Wages, the supreme Desire Of meaner NaturesâHe must sacrifice That Soul still glowing with its unquenched Fire, Not half developed yet, because Men's Eyes And Hearts are dull, and few with Genius sympat hize! 53 Alas! how few: a Riddle unto most, Which puzzles and perplexes them, and none Love what they comprehend not: thus the Frost Of Form and Custom seldom by the Sun Of Genius is thawed, 'till living run Fresh from the Heart the Founts of Poesy. The Hackneyed and the Weekday Men alone Endure, and hold their Hands to screen their Eye From Genius transfigured 'bove Humanity! 54 See Tasso, Fancy's child, roused from his dream By the harsh Light of stern reality, Which faintly thro' his Prisonbars doth gleam! See Madness and Imagination try Which shall possess him most, those strange Twins by One womb brought forth, and therefore closeallied. Behold the garland as in mockery Placed on the pale Corpse which the bier doth hide, Which Fame and Death's vile worms between them 55 Go, look at this, then tell me what is worth (thus divide! The Laurelcrown upon the haggard brow And sunken Eye? can all the powers of Earth Give back its freshness to the heart, or throw Hope's quickening dew upon the thorns which grow Blossomless, sharp, and bare upon our way? Can it unmemory the Past? Oh no! Too late, too late comes all this proud array, It dazzles not, for Grief has sobered us for aye! 56 Oh ye, on whom the Muses have bestow'd No dazzling gifts, mourn not, for e'en these are Oft linked with basest things; half Clay, half God, Is Genius, breathing half in upperair, Half grovelling in the Dust, a mixture rare Of Elements from most opposÃ«d spheres! Now up, its sublime wings the Spirit bear Far out of sight of Earth, its griefs and tears, And now they droop and trail oppressed by vulgar fears! 57 Oft when at Fame and Virtue's topmost height We seem to stand, immeasurably high, The depths of meanness open 'neath our flight, And thither may we, ere we well know why, Sink down and with the mire level lie, Companioned by the vilest of our kind! See Titian by the Demon, Jealousy, Hurled down from Ether, see brute passions blind The Eye, once full of divine Light, within his Mind! 58 And ask ye wherefore? it is well ye know, Then may ye turn, content to eat the Bread Wrung from the daily sweat of Labour's Brow Then may ye think upon the mighty dead Nor feel your Littleness when hushed ye tread Above their Graves, to which the Nations make, As unto blessed ground and hallowÃ«d, Their Pilgrimage: for Envy's vulgar ache Even from these high Souls the noblest part could take! 59 One Day as Titian 'mid his Scholars stood, He saw some drawings, and enquired who Had made them, for he thought them good: too good; They pleased him much, and yet displeased him too. The God within him recognized the true, Ethereal Inspiration which impelled The hand wherewith his own high works he drew, And inly joyed: but jealousy withheld The praise half on his tongue, the viler part had quelled 60 The nobler, and he turned displeased aside, When Tintoretto, with a modest grace And fear of fancied faults he could not hide, Replied that he had made them: from his place The Painter turned, by Jealousy made base, And banished Tintoretto from his school. The scolar's fame the Master's might efface, So needful 'tis sometimes to be a fool, And e'en of kindred Genius, Genius makes a tool! 61 But not the less did Tintoretto rise To the bright Ether after which he sigh'd, Wings had he, and wings are but for the skies. Tho' to proud Titian's school he was denied Admittance, yet, thank God, the World is wide, And not to this or that school is confined The priviledge to teach: on everyside Beauty and Wisdom greet us, and the Mind Than Nature wants no better Master nor can find! 62 Behold him now, the Muses' favored Son, Nigh equal to that Painter, if not quite, Who feared a rival in the youth halfgrown With Soul prophetic, hoping by its spite To mar a glorious Future: but her right Has Nature vindicated: see him show With a few sublime Strokes of Shade and Light The literalminded Fleming how to throw His soul upon the canvass, and with one bold blow 63 Accomplish more than weeks of vulgar toil, Where the soul dozes while the fingers wake To their dull task, still dabbling with vile Oil, As Painting were but for the colors sake, Not these for Painting: as if they could make Aught noble without that creative thought Which still the sublime pencil loves to take In its inspired hand, wherewith are wrought Forms not by Nature made, tho' she the Way hath taught! 64 Behold him full of Years and Glory, on His grey Hairs rests the Laurel wreath which he From earliest youth has laboured for alone. Worthy old Man, most worthy thus to be Inheritor of Immortality. Art was to him a Worship and a Love; And sought for her ownself, she setteth free, Yea! this is her reward, she lifts above All that debases and degrades, can raise and move 65 Our Hearts to sublime Joys, can solemnize Its beatings and affections for the Sky, And by its very Pains etherealize! And what are Fame and Glory but a lie, Compared with this? this feeling, calm and high, Of having in ourselves our own reward. A Â«certain Dante Dante is mentioned in an old Italian chronicle as Â«Dantem quemdam.Â»Â»! thus was mentioned by Some nowforgotten chronicle the Bard, Who ate the Beggar's bread, so bitter, salt and hard! 66 And this is Fame! and is it worth no more? Is this then all for which we toil and sweat Away youth's first, fresh years, and shut the door Against the World's temptations, thus to meet Neglect and cold Ingratitude? to fret And gnaw our hearts away because we are Unheeded as we pass along the street? The crowd still gathers round the Conqueror's car, While sublime Genius starves or looks on from afar! 67 So be it! let those mourn who cannot find Within themselves a recompense; but thou, Art, divine Art! hast treasures not designed For such as these: let Fame her bubbles blow For whom she will, their worth too well we know: We toil for no vain Name, but for the True, The Beautiful, which from the deep heart flow, Yea! from that very fountain whence we drew Our Being, and when found we hallow them to you! 68 And tho' we leave, when this brief life is o'er, Not e'en a passing shadow on the wall, To tell what we have been, or that we bore A part in this strange Drama: tho' of all We thought, felt, did, no thing however small Remains to witness of us, not in vain, Oh! not in vain, have we obeyed thy call, Divinest Muse! in Sorrow and in Pain Still by our side thou stood'st, and gav'st us hope again! 69 Thou quell'dst the beating heart, and from the Tear Of Grief didst kiss all bitterness away, And as the Joys of Earth grew dull and sere, And palled upon us with each added day, Lost, irrecoverably lost for aye And wither'd, like a flower without seed, In utter Barrenness: thou still didst stay, And calmer pleasures in their stead didst breed, Joys which Earth touches not, and Heaven itself must need! 70 They never worshipped thee aright who say That thy rewards are either small or slow; The Fame which passes, like a Breath, away, Which to mans's fickle Mouth its source doth owe, This, this is small indeed! but who, oh who That felt thee ever toiled for this alone? Who while the Angel gathered on his brow, And wings themselves unfolded, e'er stoop'd down From thy calm Ether, or a Thought so low would own? THE SPANISH ARMADA, A FANCYSKETCH WRITTEN IN PARTS OF TWO DAYS. August 1831. 1 Thou Sea! give up the Dead from all thy caves, Oblivion! forget thyself, and ye Winds, long died out, breathe lightly o 'er the waves As erst, which Lisbon's haughty Towers see; Ye Elements, take Shape, and once more be Moulded by Fancy to forgotten Forms, Let Hearts, long, long since Dust, beat bold and free. And then will I invoke longvanished storms, To scatter once again these Puppets to the worms! 2 For am not I a Conjuror? have I Not Fancy's Wand and Magiccircle still, And all her wondrous LaborÃ tory? Are Nature's laws not his who has the skill To cast with them in her own mould, and fill The Void of Space with Forms like Life? come then, Come step into the circle, and I will Call up a bygone world of bygone Men, And all my Magic is a few Strokes with a Pen! 3 But thou must aid me Reader, thou must be A willing Dupe, else all my skill is vain, And when I cry, Â«beholdÂ»âlo! thou must see The Glories of forgotten Days again, The silver Tagus rolling to the Main With countless Barks at anchor on his Tide, Loud Note of war, and many a martial Strain In Snatches caught, and rumours whispered wide Of golden Harvests, mighty Plans! oft blown aside, 4 As easy as Airbubbles, by the Breath Of fickle Chance; and if thou hast an Eye Of ample Power, thou shalt see beneath The Surfaces of Things, and learn how by The Graspings of Ambition the Most High Works out far other Ends than those which Man Intended, or than Statesmen prophecy, Who thro' a Microscope the Future scan, And see but their Moleways, not Heaven's sublime Plan! 5 But Ocean still rolls on, tho' these be past, These fleeting Shows of Time, and there alone Th' Eternal's Image, as of old, is glassed In its Unchangeableness! the Sun has shone On many a generation since that one Which toiled and sweated in its little Day; The loud and noisy Hopes and Wars are gone, Faded in Distance like a Dream for aye, And new and not less loud have passed since then away! 6 Thus rolls the mighty wheel fixed firmly on The Axle of eternal Truth: Realms rise And fall, but as a little Dust that's blown By Fate's rude Breath from it, as on it flies, Resolving Problems which Man's Faculties Are allunequal to; they only aid The mighty Ends for which its Task it plies, Who move concentric with it, and thus made As Spokes thereof, are still by one same Impulse sway 'd! 7 Behold the Monarch of an Ironmould, Less Man than a Machine, Automaton Wound up by Superstition and by cold Statecraft: as bloody and as stern a one As if in his Heartsstead had been a Stone. Behold him! this is he who' neath the Mask Of Christ's Religion would shed even on His altar Blood, yea! e'en in his Name ask A Hecatomb of Lives, and take himself to task 8 For slack Devotion if found wanting in Severity to Heretics: and these Were but so many as might chance to sin Against his creed, a Matter full of Ease, Since a king's creed is just what he may please, A Procrustean Bed to lop and stretch. Thus stood he, while the Tagus and the Sea's Far blue Expanse, each blending into each, Lay, like a Magicglass, God's hidden Things to teach! 9 He looked! the Ocean lay before his Feet, The Minister of his deep vengeance, for He thought not of an higher while that Fleet Before him in its Pomp and Pride he saw: Each Bark a wingÃ«d Thunderbolt of war, To be launched at his Bidding â he could see In all the mighty Plan of Wrath no Flaw: The Ocean was but as the Steed, which he, Its haughty Rider, spurred to certain Victory! 10 The fickle Elements but slaves to do His Bidding! undeceiving, Ocean lay As if his myriad waves were hushed unto The Monarch's Voice: he saw it stretch away, Calm as a sunny lake on Summerday, In boundless Distance; he marked not upon The far off wave the future Tempest's way, Nor his proud Vessels, like to Bubbles, blown From Ocean by the Breath of the avenging One! 11 Nor Wonder! he himself was as the God Of all he looked on, the creating Mind! And on Men's uncomplaining Necks he trod: The wildest Plans Ambition had designed, By its own Splendor dazzled and made blind, Were the great Child's vast Playthings, and for these He found Means in the Folly of Mankind: And as he ruled them, so with equal Ease He thought to sway the winds, and bind in chains the seas! 12 And yet, methinks, when he looked on that Deep Calm as it was, yea! for that Reason more, Receding in its unembracÃ«d Sweep, Like a Futurity, for aye before The trancÃ«d Eye, drawn ever gently o 'er The vast Expanse, as towards Eternity: Methinks it might have waked Thoughts of a Power Revealed in other Forms than those whereby The baseless Pride of Man would ape Infinity! 13 But in the mighty Mirror he beheld Not the Eternal's Image, then most there When it is stillest and by Storms least swelled, For in the Troubled his calm Spirit ne'er Reveals itself: his Eye was not half clear Enough or ample to behold that Form, He saw the Image of the Mortal here Alone, exalted 'bove his kindred Worm, And in the Armada's strength he laughed to scorn the storm! 14 But Vengeance is the Lord's, and he who dares To snatch the Thunder from his Hand must pay The Forfeit of such Rashness: he first shares The Ills which he on others' Heads would lay: Who with the Winds and Elements would play, And call on them as Ministers of Hate And Vengeance, first should tame them to his Sway: And he who rashly throws the Net of Fate, Will find himself immeshed therein when 'tis too late! 15 Blow, blow, ye Winds, and from the Monarch's Sight Waft the proud Fleet and leave him in his Dream, His Day dream! 'till he wake and see aright, For those Fools dream at Night less idle seem! Thou Time and Ocean, with conjoinÃ«d Stream Sweep onward to the Issue, for thou now With the eternal waves which fleeting gleam, Instead of thy own Sands, dost count the Flow And Ebb of human Things, and lay'st Man 's Greatness low! 16 Now moves the Panoramaâtake thy fill, Reader, for not once in a hundred years May Eye behold such Sight: the Tagus still Flows on, but not one single voice he hears Of all those many thousands whose loud Cheers Now echo from his shores. Dome, Tower, Spire, And vineclad Hill recede: the Sea appears, Vast, boundless, as the Soul's own vague Desire, An Emblem in its Calmness of a calm still higher! 17 Oh lovely Vision! see how still it lies Burning in Sunset's unconsuming Blaze, Reflecting back the rainbowtinted Skies, Whose Clouds, empurpled with the Eveningrays, By Fancy's Breath are piled, as if this Day's Forgotten Wonders had not passed away! Her divine Eye the very Forms can trace As Bark on Bark gleams in the mellow Ray, Floating on Seas which keep no Image of that Day! 18 How like a Fairytale is Life! now we Are here, then in a Moment we are gone, Like Beings of a Dream, or those we see In a Phantasmagoria: upon Our Grave the Flower springs, the Sun which shone On us lights others to the selfsame Goal: The Spiderweb each busy Brain had spun Is rent, and like an hieroglyphic Scroll Still undecy phered, each bears off with him his soul! 19 'Tis well to feel the Wonderfulâto be Truly the Spirit which lives in us, thro' Which we partake of God's Infinity: We should hold up the glass of Fancy to The coarse, hard Forms of Life, and there in new And lovelier Combinations bid them rise: Does not God himself o'er the Mountains strew Aerial Tints and rainbowpaint the skies? Then like him use that godliest of Faculties, 20 Divine Imagination! clip thou not Her wings, nor cage her to this dull Round here, But let her soar, far, far from this dim Spot, And she shall bring thee all the Joys that e'er Man crowded 'twixt the Cradle and the Bier. And some beyond with Flavour not of Earth! She shall strike off the chains of Doubt and Fear, Fill thee with Consciousness of thy own worth, And mix Life's Goblet so that it shall know no Dearth. 21 Think then thou seest each distancelessened Prow Melting in Twilight to a Speck away, And like huge Wings the white Sails fainter grow, Preybirds of Ocean, soon to be a Prey Themselves to Powers mightier than they: Think that thou hear'st the seasongs die upon The quiet Waters which in Sparkles play Around each Bark, whose keel leaves burning on Their Breast a Firewake, now here, now there, nowgone! 22 And they are passed away, yet which is most A Dream, this or the bare Reality, Which save for History were long since lost? One is just as real as the otherâwhy? Since each an Effort is of Phantasy To recreate the Past: th' historic Page, And the Scene offered now to Fancy's Eye Exist alike, the Actors and the Stage Are here, they move and brea the in Spite of Time and Age! 23 Where are the Winds that stir yon' lessening Sails? Where are the Waves, the Hearts, the Hopes, the Fears? Exist they nowhere? even Wonder fai!s To grasp the Thought: so dreamlike it appears That we cry out to see if we have Ears And Sense and live, or be ourselves a Dream! It is the Life within a Life which rears Its wondrous Outline in the Magicgleam Of Suns long, long since set, thus mirrored in the Stream 24 Of Time, on which yon' Fleet now floats away Into Oblivion, as still as Thought! Star sets on Star, Ray fades on fading Ray, Those winds and waves eternal Rest have sought, And of the Vision now remaineth naught! We rub our Eyes and look, and look again, And see things by the passing Hour wrought Around us, yet our Dream is not in vain, The Cause may be unreal, the Pleasure is real Gain! 25 Now for a Wonderâthou shalt traverse space Swifter than he of Fairymemory, Who on the Carpet moved from Place to Place: How longed I in my Childhood to sit by The Voyager, and thro' the Eveningsky Float with the purple clouds towards the West, That fair sunclime, where dreaming Poesy Fables the Dwellings of the Everblest, But wiser now I seek that Land in mine own Breast! 26 Better I know Man's Powers and the Gifts Of Heaven than to longer envy those Which are but fabled: if a Wing that lifts E'en to God's Throne the soul do not enclose In its sole self a Cure for all Life's woes, Then am I wrong: or think ye that He who Formed this so wondrous outward Eyesight, knows Not how in his Infinity unto The inward Eye to give a Sense more clear and true? 27 Our Voyage is o'erâwhat seest thou? a fair Isle, Like to an Exhalation from the sea Uprisen, touched by Fancy 's wand, meanwhile, It seems the very Cradle of the free, Or such by Heaven's will was framed to be, Clouds rest upon its white Cliffs, by the Spray Baptized in Freedom's Name eternally! And as the Mists of Morning roll away Woods, Streams, green Fields, and gleaming Spires greet the Day. 28 And Seasidecities scattered round the Land, Shipteeming Ports, the Haunts of Commerce, tho' As yet an Infant, fostered 'neath the Hand Of that wise Maidenqueen who bade it grow: Manhearted, as her Foes soon learnt to know, In Danger and in Difficulty: for She knew from whence the Tempestwind would blow And in its Seed the Giantill foresaw, And thus in Peace prepared the Nerves of future War 29 Around her rockgirt Isle she bade arise Proud Commerce, to enrich it and defend, And linked therewith her Country's Destinies, In Peace and War she followed out this End, The Winds her Ministers, the Sea her Friend And from his Oceancradle soon she saw The Giant, Commerce, towering ascend, O'er Field and City strewing Wealth, in War Snatching the Prey from out the spanish Lion's Maw! 30 The Land is like a Hive at Swarmingtime, Forge answers Forge, and Eye enkindles Eye, Heart blends with Heart to form the living Rhyme Which sounds thus, uttered-Â«Death or Liberty, In Death we live on still, in Chains we die!Â» The very Breath of weekday Life is as An Inspiration, for the Foe is nigh, Such to the Brave it ever is and was, And in his Country's Cause who for aught else would pass? 31 And when a Woman leads?-the Daughter she Of her dear Country, and most truly so, Its mighty Womb produced her spiritually: Full of its Spirit too, which then did glow Not manlier in the Warrior's Breast below The swordproof Steel. But come, stand now on yon' White Cliffs which frown on envious France, and lo! What glorious vision is that floating on The azurebosomed Main, sight unique and alone! 32 Imagination! what less than thine Eye Can take it in, or from what lesser Height Than that to which thou soar 'st, could we descry The mightiest Panorama ever sight Of Man was blessed with? far off in Sunlight, Like a seacradled City, it floats on, And the blue Waves that sink before its Might Seem to do Homage, as one after one, Like wingÃ«d Oceansteeds, each Bark distinct is shown! 33 Oh! Man how wondrous are thy Works: thy skill How infinite, thy Mind how daring: how Grasping thy Thoughts, if as thou thus canst will, Thou also couldst thus execute, if no Wise Providence marked how far thou shouldst go! And oh! how wonderful must he be then Who framed thee, who thus lays thy proud Plans low With his least Breath! Greatest to greatest Men, The first to yield him Homage still of Heart and Pen! 34 Little but unto those who themselves are Immeasurably less than little: who Lost in their Littleness see not so far As the blind Mole, that working upward to The Light, is still to his Lifespirit true: But these tho' in the blessed Light see by It not, all that they can with Reason do, Is, like the Child applying to his Eye Th' inverted Telescope, to lessen the most High! 35 Put up your Swordsâa mightier than ye Will bring this cause unto an Issue!âhear, Ye warriors! the Lord of Hosts, 'tis he! The cause is his, the cause of Truth is dear To Him, but he works not by Sword and Spear. At Times more clearly than at others, thro' The Storm his aweful Presence doth appear, The Clouds are pushed aside, and to Man's view His Rightarm is revealed, still to its office true! 36 Shall he who rules the Thunders and the Winds Want Ministers? shall he who framed the Eye Not see thro' that which human Wisdom blinds? Shall he who is Himself Infinity Be at a Loss for Instruments whereby To work out what he wills? no, surely, no! The Machinations of his Enemy Help on his mighty Plan: the seed they sow, But he alone decide what shall or shall not grow! 37 Glory unto Him! holy be his name, For wondrous are his worksâwhat is there here May stand before Him and not come to shame? The mighty Ones of Earth he withers sere As LeavesâHe breathes upon their Hosts, and Fear Falls on them, and their strength is made as naught! With viewless arm he breaks the Bow and Spear, Yet by a Child's least Prayer he may be wrought To Mercy, and by Love his Oracles are taught! 38 Rise up, ye everlasting Waves! the Hour Of Vengeance is at Hand: 'tis Liberty Invokes your Aidâthe Lord has given Power Of Life and Death, for her Defence, to ye! Awake ye Winds, and speak unto the Sea! Thunder call upon Thunder, and thou Day Be turned to sudden Night, that none may flee Thus from the wrath to come: ye Lightnings play On Desolation 's Track, and guide them on their way! 39 'Tis done!âthick Darkness wraps them as it were With a Deathshroud, fastsweeping them away To their dread Saltseagrave, and Horror there, Throned on each Prow, looms thro' the Lightningsray: While the surfthundering Rocks bestrew their way, And the fierce Watercolumns, towering high As with a Wildbeastsspring, above them play; One Moment, one Deathstruggle, one wild Cry, And Man's frail Voice is lost in the Wind's Mockery! 40 Thou mighty Ocean! thou wild Bacchanal! Tossing and tumbling with thy streaming Hair, And laughing as the pealing Thunders call Eachother to the Onset, dost thou bear No RespÃ©ct to the Will of Monarchs? are Their Frowns then in thy Estimation naught? Must the Invincible Armada share, Tho' baptized by a King, a Fate so fraught With Wretchedness, so different from that it sought? 41 Where, haughty Philip, where now is that Eye Which looked down in such Pride on Tagus-Stream, Reflecting in its broad Glass thy most high And palmy Glory? didst thou not then deem, In Man's vain Confidence, that Wakingdream An Earnest and a Revelation clear Of coming Triomphs? the first Dawningbeam Of that great Day which was to see thy Sphere, Thy bright Horizon spread o'er Empires far and near? 42 Where is the Bubble by thy proud Breath blown, And which, as it receded from thine Eye Vaster and brighter in the Distance grown, Seemed then most sure when bursting momently? Where are the countless Barks which rose as thy Mere Word had Power to create them? where The Hosts who bowed in brute Idolatry Before thee? go, go, ask thou of Despair, He only knows the Tale, he best the news may bear! 43 Like a sad Widow mourned entire Spain Amid her desolate Streets, for many a dear One came not to the Householdhearth again; Gloom sat on every Brow, the bitter Tear In many an Eye, and many a Home was drear. But he, whose mad Ambition caused the Woe, Composed his Ironlineaments to hear The News unmoved, he could not brook to show The writhings of the Heart, the serpent chained below! 44 Once more he saw the Ocean, and it lay Sublimely calm as erst: the Sunsetslight Empurpled it, and of the bygone Day The very Fellow faded on his Sight; There lay the Waves, which from his dreamy Height Had hurled him, gentle as a Child at Play; And scarcely knowing if he saw aright The Monarch gazed, then turned in Wrath away, To think a greater than himself those Waves should sway! 45 But no proud Fleet was there! naught save a few Poor Fishingboats and Merchantvessels; so Nature maintains the Needful and the True Alone, which from Man's during Being flow; While his vain Dreams the passing Wind doth blow Back into Nothing! Nature cares far more For the least Flower which by the Way doth grow Than all Man's mad Ambitions: as before She holds her quiet Course, nor heeds the vain Uproar! TO ENGLAND, ON OCCASION OF THE MONEYPANIC, OR THOUGHTS ON NATIONAL MORALITY. Finished 1831. Has God made this fair World a Prisonhouse, That we grow pale, like Men who momently A wait their Chains? has he then made the Mind Of Man so little capable, his Heart So barren of Affections, that he can Find naught to love or labour for but Gold? Can Thought and Feeling not fill out his Life, And make it great and rich, e'en tho' his Food Be Bread and Water? wherefore should ye fear To lose a little Gold? would this Life then Yield a less ample Field for all that is Most godlike in Man's Being, would he cease To be the Father, Christian, Citizen? Or would he not, the less he has of that, Be trulier these, more undividedly, Not serving God and Mammon as before, But God alone? would Nature then become Less lovely? would Love, Freedom, Friendship, Truth Lose all their divine Relish and their Gloss? Or rather being no more bought and sold, Nor desecrated by the Pander's Hand, Would they not then become, as meant, the chief Grand Goods of Life, which make it liveable? Yes! yes! I say: then wherefore do ye talk Of Loss, when Life's most godlike Goods remain? Of which none, none can rob ye, save yourselves! But this ye do most, most effectively By holding them as naught compared with Gold! Then wherefore stand ye thus in blank Amaze As Nature had foregone her Functions, as Tho' the Larksvoice had grown quite out of Date, The Rose had lost its Perfume, and Man's Life Its Crowningcharm? if but the Dayseye had Passed from this Earth, then first were Cause to weep, For it is something natural and true, And therefore godlike: but fear not, just for This Reason it, and all that like it is So true and natural, will never pass Away from this fair Earth, whate'er it be, A Work of Nature, or a Thought of Man! Small as it seems its Roots are deep and strong, Yea! reaching to the Heart of Things, and still Unfailingly amid the Wreath which Spring Weaves, like a Daughter with officious Hands Of Love, for Nature's holy Brows, shalt thou Find the Â«wee, modest, crimsontippÃ«d FlowerÂ», When Thrones and Kingdoms pass and are forgot! Why is it thus, that i'the Middaysun Our Hearts be dark as Midnight, and our Pulse Like Waters that creep sluggishly beneath The numbing Ice? oh! 'tis a sorry Sight! A Sight that makes me sick at Heart, to think That the inspiring Breath of breezy Morn, Which lifts the Birdswing, like a Thought, to Heaven, Cannot blow o'er the meanest Sod of Earth, The most uncared for Lea, and not awake A thousand Flowers which, howsmallsoe'er, Are perfect in their kind, that this same Air Fresh from the green Leaves and the sunny Hills, Breathes on the Face of Man and leaves in him No more Trace than upon the waste Seasands, And worse, far worse too, that the Breath of God Breathed into Man can quicken him no more, Nor call from him half so much of the Good, The Fair and Useful as the Wind does from The Clod which Plough ne'er broke nor Hand e'er sowed! Tho' one be but of gross, material Earth, The other of ethereal Element With Seeds of Growths eternal, such as are Not subject unto Chance and Change, to frail Vicissitudes of Seasons and of Times, But planted here for endless Blossoming Hereafter, where no sere Decay is known! My God! and hast thou in thy Image framed Thy Creature, in his Make so fair and free, So goodly to behold, that but to look Once on his heavenlifted Brow must wake A Consciousness of what he is, and is To be hereafter: is it then in vain That thou hast made him thus? with Faculties Divine inform'd him, placed in this fair World, Its Masterpiece and sole Interpreter; The Highpriest of a far, far greater than The Delphic Shrine, of holier Secrets, thro' Whose Mouth, as from some thoughtunfathomed Depth, Nature gives forth her Oracles, reveals Th' invisible Things of God, and in him as Both Man and Nature prophecies of an Eternal Being, of a Future far More clearly and sublimely than of old The Pythia from her Tripod! hast thou made Him vainly then this fair World's Centrethought, There with his Hopes and Feelings to complete The higher Links of that unbroken Chain Of Harmonies, which from the least, least Form Of Being runs up to the very Throne Of that eternal Love, from whence he draws His Birth and Blessing! âOh my God, is this A Prisonhouse in which we dwell? are these Blue Heavens stretching far as Thought away But stifling Dungeonwalls: is this green Earth, This flowerscented Earth, a Dungeonfloor? Are all the sweet Vicissitudes of Times And Seasons, all the Poesy of Eye And Ear, become so hackneyed to our Sense, That we must turn away like heartsick Men, Like feverfretted Prisoners, whose Eyes Have drunk Despair from their damp Dungeonwalls, And turn to Scoffings and Revilings at Our Maker and his Gifts, because forsooth! We are selfwearied, selfdebased, selfslaved, In our own Souls imprisoned, chained by Thoughts, Those worst of Chains, which bind far tighter than The fleshcompressing Iron, to a far, Far narrower Compass, and wheree'er we move Stand 'twixt the Light and us, God's blessed Truth, Still intercepting and discoloring it Far more than do the thickest Prisonwalls And dingiest Dungeonbars: that blessed Truth, Which he who wants is less a man than Beast, Degraded more, as made for highest Things! Oh God! to think that this most glorious Sense, This Eye, the Instrument of that within, Whereby it looks abroad upon the Modes And Forms of outward Being, 'till they grow Part of our Spirit, stealing from the Heart, As Winds from Flowers, its rich Perfumes, which Tho' borne as 'twere upon the pathless Winds In seeming Barrenness, fall yet again, Embodied in a sweeter Shape, on the Same Heart whence they were stolen, thus put out To richest Usuryâthis glorious Eye, That faithsubdued has seen the cloudy Veil Of Heaven halfwithdrawn, for Sense may be Transfigured, so as to be bound no more By vulgar Laws or limited to Earth. Oh! that this Eye wherewith the Soul has seen Things which it moulds within unto the Shape Of its own Yearnings, making thus the Heart A Fount of Beauty, whose elysian Drops Embathe with Edentints, and make eterne To Love and to Enjoyment, Things that else Would pall upon the outward Sense and fade, If that which is imperishable had Not breathed on them. Oh! that this noble Eye Thro' which the Soul roams over Hill and Dale, And lives abroad, free Denizen of Air, Should be dwarf'd into a mere Microscope To magnify Time's paltry Interests, To make out Ledgers and to sum up Pence! 'Till those farstretching Visionviews of Things, Glimpses of Light unutterable, fade: Invisible Glories, dreamlike Mysteries, Which are or are not as the Soul doth will, From whence too grows a fairer World around Us, like a Life within a Life, a World Not realized, but in which we still are! As in the Water some fair Landscape floats Softmirrored, like a Magicpicture, where Familiar Objects may be recognized, But as it were transfigured, glorified, Translated to a calmer, ampler Sphere; Where we may be too with our Souls, there like Those objects glorified, translated, tho' Not with our Bodies: yet the most real Life Is that of Soul, for where our Souls are we Must truliest be! thus it is and is not! Like a bright Bubble which exists to Sight But not to Touch: be wise then, touch it not, And it will gladden still thy Heart: what good Can touching it do thee? as if thy Hand Could grasp what fills thy Soul, or aught that it Feels could be made more real by being touched! 'Till these all fade and die, nor these alone, But with them (since the Soul nought godlike can Accomplish unless in the Godlike it Believes) the generous Thoughts and genial Powers, The pure Imaginings, the loftier Hopes, The Love of noble Things, which not alone Do beautify the individual Life Of Man and sanctify the Poetspage, But in a Nation's Heart are the grand Pulse Of all true Energy: Mainartery Of its best Lifeblood, which thro every Vein Spreads the soulsaving Health of moral Worth; Hence is that Selfrespect, the best Safeguard 'Gainst Selfdebasement: hence that noblest Pride Which deems it glory to be even least In the good Cause, and something to be last: Hence that true Wisdom of the Fireside Which thro' all kindly Exercise of Love Teaches the Lore of Peace and Charity: Not wreathing round his Brows the Laurel by Blood watered and the Widowstears, whose Root Is in the barren Soil of Strife, whence Seed Of Good ne'er sprang: not reaping with the Sword, Unreason's Sickle! the so sudden and Unripened Harvests of brute Violence And Wrong, but gathering them duly in When old Experience has had her full And perfect Work: matured by sober Thought, By Fellowcreaturelove and weekday Toils, Not loud and dazzling to attract the Eye Of shallow Vanity, but bringing home Unto the daily Heart a daily Bliss! Not fitful Good, but equally diffused, And like the Springsap of a healthy Tree, Which allpervading gives no prurient Strength To this Part or to that, but at one Time Impregnates Root and Branch, the budding Leaf, The scarceformed Flower and the Embryofruit, With the Extremities in Earth and Air; So thro' the State's wide Growth of moral Ties, Of mutual and entwinÃ«d Interests Public and private, there should circulate One same Lifespirit from the mightly Heart, Pulsing unweariÃ«d thro' every Vein To keep the Bodypolitic in Health; And all its Members should true Wisdom bind Into one compact Shape of moral Worth, Blending tenmillion Hearts into one Pulse, One mighty Pulse of universal Love, Of Tolerance, and Truth and Liberty, Whose Beatings should be those of God's own Heart! And oh! my England, my dear Fatherland, Must this high Wisdom, which was once the Dower Of earlier Days, which shed a Beauty on Cottage and Hall and Palace, like a Charm Hallowing the meanest Thing it fell upon, Must this high Wisdom, this pure Presence of The God, be from its living Temple in Mens' Hearts cast out, cherished but in dead Books, Vain Records of those nobler Days when Life Was as a Mirror to the written Lore, Truth, Faith and Chivalry in Action, which Are banished now from this prosaic World, As Dreams from Broaddaylight, or linger but On some Enthusiast's Lips whom Youth and Love Keep still contaminationfree! alas! Our Sidneys and our Miltons are no more; A Sabbathwisdom in a Weekdaylife We cannot comprehend! we have none such, Who on the broad Highway and beaten Track, In Company with Souls that never once Have shaken Custom's Dust from off their Feet, Could make high Poesy a living Truth, Sublimed and not debased by being brought Down to the Level of real Life, and made Familiar to the Eyes and Hearts of Men; Another Sense, itself worth all the Rest, And giving unto these a tenfold Worth! We have none such who live their Poesy As well as write it: who are first great Men And then great Poets, who can unto Life's Most common Forms impart the Freshness of A Dream and turn all Things within their Sphere Of Thought to their own Worth: still holding, and Most rightly, that the Elements of e- Ven more than epic Grandeur in real Life Alone abound, for there alone can Man Be and work out the Godlike; and methinks The Godlike is the highest Poesy And Truth in one: the highest Poesy As Fact, in which Light it is felt by God! And who feels Poesy if he does not, Who made, not wrote the sublime Poem of This fair World? who for Words gives Images, For mere Thoughts, Things, and lays bare to the Eye The Hall of Wonders which the Poet dreams! These noble Hearts are gone! and Milton's Mind, Which lightninglike flashed forth from that dark Cloud, (That Tempestcloud, which burst above this Land,) Its Birthplace, wherein Might and Right had met To measure Strength, tho' it still dwell with us, A Presence as of high Divinity, And might be as the Nation's Soul, to give Us olden Days again and Deeds of Worth, Yet quickens us no more, but as it were Some heathen Oracle's forsaken Shrine, Is dead to Good: no more the mighty Voice Of the indwelling Spirit prophecies And warns from out its holy Depths, as from Another World: instructing us how still A Nation may be great tho' poor, how shake Off Custom's galling Yoke, not seldom borne So long that Freedom's self seems strange, a Gift, A Blessing vain! âAlas! my Countrymen. Lay not the flattering Unction to your Souls: Freedom's an arduous Thing, and must be won With Toil and Sacrifice: she must be loved For her ownself, (since this alone is Love) Ere she will show herself in her true Shape, Or make Return of Love; who worships her To figure on this World's loud Stage and make Her Name a Steppingstone to selfish Ends, Him she disclaims, he's but an Actor there For such brief Time as suits his own base Views, And sympathizes with the Part he plays About as warmly as the Mummer with The Tinselrobe and Waxenmask in which He rants upon the Stage! nor deigns she with Her Name to sanction the too fickle Crowd, That with the bloodstained Sword would cut intwain The Bonds by their own Baseness twined around Their brutish Necks; she loves not Violence, And still less needs: she can accomplish more With patient Wisdom and a few plain Truths Than armÃ«d Hosts and mighty Monarchies, And with a Milton's Thought she can work out Regeneration for a fallen Race Far surer than by Sinew and by Nerve! For Thought works on Men's Hearts, the Godlike on The Godlike, and he who controuls but these Can sway the Hand and Sword as he thinks fit; Like God, into Men's Minds he enters, with His Thought as theirs, unconsciously to them, Directs their Efforts and controuls their Will! With this then she loves most to work, by that Which in Man is most godlike: for by what Else could the Spiritual be attained? And when no other Way by Vice is left, When the Dearth of the Godlike is so great That she too must perforce use palpable Means, 'Tis with a Hampden's Hand she grasps the Sword Which then is that of Justice! she loves not A wealthencumbered, pompbesotted Race, These are of outward and of fleeting Things, They're from and of the Dust, and who loves these Too dearly cannot love his Freedom, for He would be loath to part with these for it, Therefore 'tis not that highest Good to him Which it becomes then only when we think And feel it really so! âAlas for us! The Shadow of a coming Woe is thrown Aforetime on us, but still in the Dust At Mammon's Feet we lie, and offer up Unhallowed Prayers to curse ourselves withal: 'Till Heaven offended, but in Wrath still just, And dealing most appropriate Punishment, Curses us with Fulfillment of our Prayers, Giving us endless Wealth that we may reap Most bitter Degradation, that e'en by Our darling Sin we may receive the full Amount of Retribution: growing less And less adapted 'to all lofty Things, 'Till our Souls have no longer Fellowship With Essence, nor can recognize in Life's Familiar Forms the During and the True. Thus by our Thirst for Wealth we see all Things Distort, yet know it not, 'till that which is Most strange, unnatural and most opposed Unto our Being's End becomes at length So commonhackneyed that we no more feel How monstrous this our Transformation is. We fashion exquisite Machines and thus Intelligencing them, become alas! Ourselves less than intelligent, halfbrute: Degraded from that Wisdom which should look Before and after, which alone can judge Life's Aims aright, referring them to Truths Eterne, not by the Ellwand which is used In the World's Traffic and vile Bartering To measure Forms and Customs, and the low And meagre Product of Reality, But that high Measure which alone has Scope To compass the Unchanging and Eterne, Being akin to these; our very Thoughts Themselves do carry, as it were, the Stamp Of Machineproduce, coarse, material, Reducing all Things to the Positive And Palpable, Religion to its Forms, Faith to her Creed, and Freedom to her Signs And outward Images: alas for us! Who hope to win the highest Goods of Life By Mechanism and to frame at Will, Like so much Broadcloth, a proposed Amount Of Freedom, Knowledge, Truth and Happiness, Who roake a Trade of these celestial Things And think that intellectual Light may be Diffused like Gas thro' Pipes, or sold from Door To Door by Ounce and Pound, dol'd niggardly, Like other Shopwares, at its own fixed Price: Not fructified by Love nor spread abroad Like God's ungrudgÃ«d Daylight that all Eyes May reap the common Blessing, that all Things, All Persons, Usages, Pursuits and Aims, May have their own true Comment from the Lips Of catholic Wisdom looking calmly o'er The Scene of Man's Exertions, keeping still In View his loftier Bourne and steadily Distinguishing those Things which are eterne And heavenly from passing Modes of Time And Man's frail Institutions, on which he Has built the Pile of Error towering high Tho' sandbased, being raised on Sophistry And Prejudice and hollow Forms, which with That mightiest Lever, Man's enlightened Thought, Embodying Nature's Instincts, Reason's Laws Into a Voice of calmest, holiest, And most majestic Utterance, as 'twere An Echo of God's own, the Nation might Raze to the Earth, yet shake not one least Stone Of that vast Temple, beautiful and firm Upon its Basis of eternal Truth, Where, in the Service of the Mosthigh God, Love, Reason, Freedom, like pure Vestals still Unwearied in their Office, ever watch The Altarflame of Faith and therewith touch And purify the Lips of all who come To vow a pure, enduring Ministry To Freedom, ever labouring with Hand And Heart in that high Service: not by Strife And Violence debasing her fair Name, Nor so unconscious of that which She is And of the Inspiration which they claim For her true Votaries as to believe That she would stoop to palpable Agency Of Muscle and of Sinew to work out Her godlike Ends: but bringing holily To her high Altars Trophies from the calm And blessÃ«d Victories of Truth, who binds Not with material Bonds the Limbs, nor makes Slaves of those whom she conquers, no! not e'en Of him who is the least among her least, But with her Touch of Light strikes from the Soul The inward Shackles, leading it with her A willing Captive, ever then most free When most devoted to her: having then The fullest Use of all its Faculties And noblest Priviledges when it bears The Badge of her high Service readiest! And serving best that Wisdom, serving her, Which on all vital Interests decides, Still in Decision authorizÃ«d by The Beatings of the universal Heart, True Wisdom and true Feeling being one! Thus on eternal Basis building up That best Equality where Men are made Equal by Virtue, Love and Godliness, Acknowledging Superiors in those Alone who serve their heavenly Master best By doing Good to all Men, and who show Their Zeal not in disputing about Place And Precedence, but in obeying Him, Wellknowing that the least in doing Good Is more than first in Earth's vain Pageantry! Serving, yet neither ostentatiously, That Wisdom which, by teaching us to seek And value that which is essential to And constitutes Man's Being, best instructs Us how to estimate aright the World And all its glittering Vanities, yet not To look with Scorn upon the meanest Thing, The poorest Beggar, tho' he be in need Of all that Prejudice and Wealth and Pride Deem indispensible: for he may still Want nothing in God's Eyes who looks not at The Rags upon his Back, nor less for these Enters into his Soul and from him speaks The Godlike and the True! yea! he may still Be no mean Being! he may have a Soul Mighty and comprehensive, full of Faith, Yea! even Love to all, which neither Pain, Nor Want, nor Suffering can lessen: yea! He may be one of those whom Christ would chuse For a Disciple should he come again, For not 'neath Silk and Ermine only beats The godlike Heart, nor thro' the haughty Veins Of ancient Birth alone the genuine Blood Of pure Humanity flows strong! and he Whom Injury and Insult have not made A Hater of his Kind, in whom no Wrong Can make the Eye of Wisdom look asquint Or chill the Heart of Love, that Man might sit Upon the Monarch's Throne and grace it more Than any on whose Brows the Hand of Chance Has dropp'd the golden Circle of a Crown! Yea! he is crowned already! on his Head He bears a viewless Diadem, the Crown Of pure Humanity, which even God Would not disdain to wear, he is a King, A King of his ownself, the greatest, best! By divine Right, not Usurpation, called To fill the Throne which he becomes so well! And yet how many pass him by, or look Upon him as an Outcast: but from what Is he an Outcast? from his Father's Love? No, no, of that he has an ample Share: Yea! having nothing else on Earth it is His all-in-all, and therefore too God is Â«The FatherÂ» to him! and how can he be Called poor who of so rich a Father is The Child, and whose Inheritance is so, So sure? from what is he an Outcast then? No! ye, ye are the Outcasts who look on His poor, bare Head with Scorn: for if ye were Children of that same Father ye would see In him a Brother, as he is, and press Him to your Hearts as such! and then, yea! then Your heavenly Father would rejoice to think He had such Children and would feel himself More rich thro' them than by unnumbered Worlds! Ye are the Outcasts then, for ye have no, No Father, nor in his so, so godlike Inheritance have any Share, of that Divinest Love which is its noblest Part! Better, far better were it for ye to Want all Things, yea! e'en Food and Raiment, than This one most indispensible of all! Ye are the Poor, the Beggars, for ye want E'en Love, which e'en the Beggar himself has, And having which is godlike! what more then Can ye be, unless ye were God himself, For he's all Love, and therefore is he God! Alas for us who with the holiest Things Work out but vilest, commonest: who with The highest Instruments accomplish naught But the dull Drudgery of weekday Life. Thus Education, that divinest Boon Which Charity from out the goodly Store Of Heaven's choicest Gifts bestowed on Man, And whose ethereal Lamp should kindled be With purest Altarfire of Faith, sheds but A scant, imperfect Light on this poor Space Of Earth we tread on, on the fleeting Aims And Interests of Time, by which we grope Still blindly after Seeminggoods when with Firm Step and skyward Glance we might move on Securely to our blessed Heritage! Alas for Education, she is not The Handmaid of Religion, she stands not Like a benificent Angel robed in White Beside the Templedoor to beckon us To that her noblest School, and open it With radiant Smile unto our Infantfeet Ere they have gone astray, while yet the Heart Is plastic for the Impress of its God! Alas! we have debased her: she is now The Handmaid of this cold and heartless World, And, fitly punished, we receive from her, Who should dispense all heavenly Gifts, the Chains Which Prejudice and Custom rivet on The yet-unconscious Soul, those inward Chains That fetter Freedom's Spirit at its Birth, And which we bear with us e'en when we seem And think ourselves most free, yea! even then We are as Slaves, for we have learnt to judge By a false Standard, crookÃ«d as Untruth, Thus that which is most straight unto our Eyes Distorted seemsâ Alas! unhappy Men, Born to experience how noblest Things Perverted turn to worst: who have but learnt From Education that which fits them for The Moleways of the World, whom she has taught But to outwit eachother in the vile And crooked Paths of human Policy, Of Pelf and GainâFoxwisdom which can plan right cunningly and of its narrow Sphere Knows all the Ins and Outs, but cannot see The Nothingness of all it seeks, nor grasp The End and the Beginning of all Life, Nor know what in the Interval may be Worthy a Wiseman's Choice: what matters it That the Mind be wellstored, the Faculties Quick, forgetive and exercised, if still They lack the vital and inspiring Heat Of holy Aspiration, if the Will Remain unpurified, if tho' we see That which is right we love it not nor seek: If our Affections be not schooled, so that Instinctively, e'en as the Ivy climbs The neighbouring Tree, they may be led to twine Themselves around the Pillars which support The glorious Temple of the living God, Truth, Faith, Love, Justice, upon which the Dome Of Heaven itself rests everlastingly! What is a Nation worth if it bear not The Impress of the Godlike grandly on Its weekday Character? if all its Toils And Institutions tend not to exalt The Faculties of Soul, but only serve To multiply the vile Accessories, The physical Comforts of this sensual Life, As tho' the Body were our only God, As tho' Man's noblest Heritage were but The brief Enjoyments which Sensation yields! What boots it that Religion teach to such Her blessÃ«d Truths? what profits it to say To men who worship Mammon, Â«take no Heed For that ye eat, or that which ye shall drink, Or that the Body shall put onÂ», for Life, The Breath of Reason and the Soul of Faith, To these is less than Food or Raiment! yea! To such her Words are Foolishness, mere Sounds, Mere empty Sounds, mouthed on the Sabbathday By some cold Hireling to whom God's Word, God's blessÃ«d Word so full of Life and Health And all Regeneration, is but as The Trade by which he earns his daily Bread, Unhappy Man! far better in the Sweat Of Toil and Misery to labour on Than thus to sin unto the Holy Ghost, Profaning the sublimest Instrument Of human Good by making it a Tool In a vile Hand of mercenary Gain! And who are they that listen? who are they To whom the lifedispensing Words are taught By Lips which Faith has never purified With her high Altarfire nor enriched With Utterance for her own hidden Truths? Who are they? Men and Women that by Rote Repeat the Words to which their Hearts and Minds Give neither Warmth nor Meaning, who are met For Formssake in Godshouse, because forsooth! Custom so wills it and the outward Rules Of Decency, and who, when this dull Farce Is ended, bear away unquickened Hearts, Untouched by one blest Thought, to mingle once Again in the World's Turmoil as before, Amid its Fret and Fever to renew The Nothingness of former Toils, to strive, To jostle and blaspheme, to hate and grudge! There is no Hope for us, for if the Eye Be evil, if the Light within us be As Darkness, must we not then go astray? If from our earliest Years Religion be Not a Conviction of the inmost Soul And a most real Affection of the Heart: But a mere Dogma stripped of all that makes It beautiful and dear to daily Life, A Skeleton with no warm, beating Heart: If it be not the Poetry by which We keep alive all Feeling, then it is Unprofitable as the Priest's dull Lie: 'Tis Superstition, Bigotry and Hate, A Firebrand of Strife and not the Kiss, The blessÃ«d Kiss of Love which heals all Wounds And reconciles all Creeds: for there is one, One Creed alone, intelligible un- To all alike, yea! even to the Babe Upon his Mother's Breast, and which all, all Can practice too, for it requires naug ht But what all, all, yea! e'en the least can give, A little human Love! for none is so, So poor as Love with Love not to repay, And he who even Injuries requites Therewith is godlike, yea! as God alone! This is the easy Creed, not learnt by Rote From Prayerbooks, but from all we hear and see, And most from our own Hearts, where it is by God's own Voice sanctioned and enjoined, and made By his sublime Example so, so clear That e'en the Blind by Feeling read it right! He is the one true Blind who cannot see, By Love, what e'en the Blindman sees as 'twere With open Eyes: he stumbles at Midday, For in his Eye he has the Â«BeamÂ» of which Our Saviour spoke and will not pluck it out; Far better 'twere had he plucked out both Eyes And halted on a Staff, than stumbled thus! Consoler of the Poor, the sick of Heart, Th' oppress'd and injured, Faith! what Friend have they If to their bitter Lot thou bringÃ«st not Some heavenly Consolation, if thy sweet, Low Voice ne'er whisper to the breaking Heart Those joyous Words, not for the Ears of Kings And Potentates designed, but for the Poor, Â«BlessÃ«d are they that mourn, for they shall be Consoled and comfortedÂ»: a daily Want Of the Heart unto them art thou, yea! more So than their daily Bread: their Life is an Inexplicable Riddle without thee, But with thee 'tis a godlike Suffering! Therefore the Poorman is no Sceptic, in the Absence of all meaner Stays he falls Back on his God and is upborne by him As Thrones are not by Armies and by Gold! Then let mankind upon that Pillar lean And godlike will it stand by its ownself When Thrones are shaken to their Base! for why Should it lean on a Reed? God speaks from it, Feels by and with it, therefore let it trust Itself, for doing so it trusts in God! And who shall turn it then from its high Path? Then calmly onward let it move like to A mighty Army marshalled by the Lord, The Lord of Hosts, who as its Spirit leads It on ward: its least Whisper is enough To scatter Armies, for it is the Breath Of God and who shall stand before the Lord? To doubt of itself is to doubt of Him, And then of all its Strength must it be shorn, And, like to Sampson, into Bondage led! But fear not this: its Strength is in its Heart, Not like to Sampson's, then let it take Heart And it will not want Strength, of this be sure! The rich Man may be sceptical; Faith is No Want to him, and when he prays to God Â«Give us this Day our daily BreadÂ» he scarce Knows what he prays for: but it is the Hand Of God himself which brings it each Day to The poor Man, for he knows not who else would Provide him with it, and therefore it is So godlike, Food fit e'en for Angelslips, As a Foretaste of Heaven! but that which The rich Man eats is not brought to him by The Hand of God, for he who has too much May make sure that it came not from God's Hand, For he distributes better, tho' Men will Not do as he: and therefore too the Bread The rich man eats is brought him not by God's But by the Baker's Hand! and how can he Be poor then whom God himself feeds and serves? Yea! he is served as is no rich Man! then, Then leave the Poor their Faith, the sublime Thought Of taking thus their daily Bread from God's, As from a Father's, Hand, not thinking how They shall be clothed or fed! for if ye rob The last, sole Solace left to them on Earth, If this Belief be not inculcated And made a Motive, oh! then take ye heed Ye Nationrulers, ye to whom it is As clay within the Potter's Hands, take Heed Lest they indemnify themselves on Earth For what they suffer and from Surfeit take The Overmuch which it were vain to ask! Alas! for us, who revel in brute Pomp And Luxury, yet dole with niggard Hand The Means which would diffase the saving Health Of pure Religion thro' the Nation's Soul; Alas for us who dream the Happiness And Glory of a People e'er can be By sordid Wealth and brute Machinery Attained or maintained, knowing not this Truth, That never was a Nation truly great Save and except by Virtue, and that where Undue Esteem attaches unto Things Allied to Chance and Change, and when thereby A false Direction is imparted to Exertion and Affection, there can be No Freedom, Nobleness or moral Worth: And that the Nation, which thus blindly seeks The Nothingness of Wealth, is punished by The outraged and offended Majesty Of Truth and Virtue scorning there to dwell Where Mammon is adored! alas for us, Who strive to rival by Machinery The boundless Powers of Soul and realize In palpable Forms that which exists in Thought And Mind alone! poor, drivelling Idiots! We may augment the Body's Comforts 'till Wrapped up in Silk and Selfishness we nigh Forget there is a God, or that the Wind Blows sharply on the Back of Poverty And naked Want: may make the Elements Like Spirits wait on us, the changeful Wave, Like a whiteman 'd Seahorse obedient to The Rein, crouch at our Feet, the fickle Breath Of Heaven lend its Wings, nighrivalling Those of Imagination, to each bold Design, and stubborn Earth our daily Drudge! We may destroy, as 't were, both Time and Space, Yet still in Time and Space, we cannot pass The Bounds assigned us; still the mighty Realm Of Soul in its Immensity is ruled But by the Spirit dwelling there alone: Not for such Things allmighty Wisdom here Has placed us, not that with Machinery We might subdue the stubborn Elements Of Earth and Water, tho' this too be good, But the more stubborn Elements of Will: To perfect this divine Machine we call The human Being, that its Products may Last to Eternity and be approv'd In God's own Sight, when Dust and Darkness lie On these vain, fleeting Forms and Boasts of Earth Wherein we place our Pride, mistaking still Means for the End! âWhat is true Strength I ask? Do ye know what it is? have ye e'er look 'd Into the mystic Depths of your own Souls, Whence spring the primal Sources of all Life, All Action, Being? Truth, Faith, Liberty, Religion, Poetry, the Love of all Things high and holy, without which we are But as the Beasts that perish: thence is Strength, That Strength whose viewless Might is as the Breath Of God himself, and of which the most fit And sublime Emblem is the Thought of Man In which it most appears! thence is that Strength Which can build up the broad and ample Base Of mighty Empires, else on Stubble raised And fleeting as a Dream! the Base of Right And Justice which alone can bear the Weight Of during Majesty, whose Roots are struck Deeper than Earth's deep Centre, to the Core Of universal Being, beyond Time, Removed from Chance and Change, for ever firm! And can Machinery, tho' it should lay Pyramid on Pyramid and Rock on Rock, Build up a Base like this? the Earthquake 's Stroke Would shatter it, and Time would wear away Its palpable Strength when that of which I speak Would stand a Glory and a Joy for aye! Would ye know what true Strength is? ask ye then Of Time who tests it and of History Whose Page loves to record its Victories O'er the brute Foes who bar awhile its Course, O'er Error, Ignorance and Prejudice, And all the palpable Might of armÃ«d Hosts In vain resisting: subtler than the Light It interpenetrates all Forms, yea! e'en The inmost Thought of Man, and moulds them to Its divine Will, while Sword, and Tower and Wall And Armies melt before its gentle Breath, So gentle yet so irresistible! Like Snowflakes in the viewless Breathings of The soft Favonian Wind: and mighty Thrones Pass from their Place, like Dreams from God's pure Light, Before its Glance of genuine Majesty! It is invincible: no proud Array, No idle Tumult waits upon its Step, But like the Air it moves wheree 'er it lists, Felt tho' unseen and unimpedeable! One Man with it can conquer Millions and Without it Millions are but as the Chaff Before the Wind, soon trodden into Dust By Time's unresting Foot! for he who has True Strength fights not alone, but ever by His Side are mighty Champions, unseen By sensual Sight yet to the Mindseye clear, Like Angels clad in Heavenspanoply, Skytemper, fashioned in ethereal Forge And allinvulnerÃ ble, Wisdom, Truth, Eternal Love and Justice by him stand, And like to Sampson with the Assesjaw He needs no Weapon save the Consciousness Of his good Cause! he is then something more Than Man, he is an Incarnation of Eternal Truth, and thus what he works out Bears no Proportion to his seeming Means. He may have Rags upon his Back, yet if He be the Mouthpiece of the Deity, That Deity can so enlarge his Voice That it shall fill all Mankind's ample Ear: He gives the Want of its great Heart a Voice, That Want which, long-aforming, takes in him A positive Development and thus Made clear and definite fulfills its End, In and thro' him, yet still it is Mankind's Great Heart that into his one Breast has passed And makes Use of his Voice! âLive ye in Soul, And let your Thought be of the bygone Days From whence a steady Brilliance still shines forth, Undimmed by Time and Change: transport yourselves To that old Wilderness from whence was heard, Dimsounding, as the Spirit of the World, Forefeeling in its inmost Depths the Spell, Had uttered it, a Voice of solemn Note, Prophetic of a mighty Change to pass Over the Face of Earth, the Baptist's Voice: Then with the spiritual Stream, whereof At its Springhead the Solitary's Soul Had drank, move on, and in Time's Fullness see It to a mighty River broadening Of pure, majestic Waters, unwithstood, And tell me if true Strength dwells not with Truth? What else could overthrow the Prejudice And Error which lay like a Shroud on Earth! Could Sword and Spear do this? can they destroy One single Error of the human Mind? Or can the Conqueror with all his Hosts Root out one Prejudice, can he with these Work out what but a few, few Words of Truth With a divine Constraint accomplish so, So beautifully thro' the Minds of Men Themselves, the only certain Instrument? And therefore not with Sword or Spear he wrought, For having heavenly Things in view he would Not use mere earthly Means! nor had he need: The Highest by the Highest easiest Is wrought out, Truth acts direct on the Soul, Man's Highest, and therefore he stood alone, Unarmed, defenceless, but embodying The Powers of Heaven in Simplicity And Lowliness of Heart, in these was great, In these invincible: thus too he raised His spiritual Empire on the best Affections of Mankind, on Truths which Man Does not so much believe as is, and which He therefore must believe so long as he Is Man at least. âWhat has brute Force wrought out Of Godlike or Enduring? it may pile Its Monuments and urge its Hosts along At one Man's Bidding to accomplish some Eyedazzling but unmeaning Pageantry, Which Time shall scatter like the Morningmists: But for the Life of Life it can do naught. Thro' the whole Range of History look back And say what it has done: it reaches but To the mere outward Form and on its Track Lank Desolation waits, for it destroys Not betters: nay, it cannot change the Form Enduringly untill it changes too The Spirit which alone the Form creates! Of all that constitutes Man's Dignity, Of all the Powers of human Weal and all The loftier Elements and Faculties, The Source is to be found in his ownself, In his own infinite Expanse of Soul Where Nature has epitomized herself, As the Rose in its Scent: what has Force had To do with the grand Revolutions of Man's Life, they were the Work of silent Thought Who like a mighty Spirit moves at Will Over the Face of Earth, which as he moves He quickens with his viewless Breath, and lo! A Change is at the mighty Heart, its Pulse Is quickened, and thereof a Shadow on Time's Glass is thrown beforehand, as it were A Spirit moving o'er it ere he take A sightbare Shape, and with a Thought 'tis there! 'T has passed into Mankind, which, as if by The Breath of God inspired, onward moves With mighty Stride, godlike and confident! Say what had force to do with that high Voice Which called for Reformation, heard of yore Ringing from Side to Side in this our Isle, Stirring Mens' Hearts with vast, ideal Hopes, And Yearnings towards a Good not realized, Yet in that Voice forefelt, and dazzling Gleams From the bright Wings of that old Glory which Had shone on Man's dim Eyes upon the Birth Of the World's Saviour, for in those Days The universal Heart, the Nation 's Heart Was stirred in all its Depths, and feeling deep- Ly and intensely it was capable Of mighty Issues. Rut, alas! in us The primal Sympathies are dead awhile, And great things stir us no more greatly: thus The Beautiful, the Holy and the True, Being beyond the Compass of our Thought, We have curtailed and dwarfed to suit the vile And meagre Standard of Utility, Not elevating our ownselves to them But bringing down their Natures unto us! We are no longer taught to love the Truth And to do Good for their own blessÃ«d Sakes Because the Highest in our Nature, but For Prudence sake, for Decency, because It is the Fashion and would be bad Taste Not to do as the restâReligion 's self Is but mere Calculation, as it were A Debtor-and a Creditoraccount 'Twixt God and Conscience; no more unto Faith Are given now the Things which are her own, Her Eye is filmy and no longer has Its Visions, and no longer in the Heart Of Man keeps she her Sabbath, there is no Holy of Holies there for her, e'en there Does Profanation clamour and blaspheme! The Church, the outward and the visible Form Wherein Religion dwells, what is it now? But as a Tree that has outlived itself, With no more Lifesap to produce good Fruit Or flourish as of yore, when in the Soil, Racy and fresh, of genuine Belief She struck her mighty Roots and 'neath the Shade The grateful Nations sat; but now, alas! The Spirit has departed and elsewhere It seeks a Home, for it is, like the Air And Sunshine, universal, meant for all, The Breath of the Soul's daily Life, the Light Of all its Seeing, it may not be shut Up in dead Forms nor limited unto The Crosier and the Surplice, else 'tis but An outward Sign with naught to correspond, A costly Garment on a Skeleton! Yea! we have Preachers from whose Lips the Word, God 's blessÃ«d Word in which is Life and Health, Drops but as a dead Thing: aye, Men who clothe In Purple and fine Linen, and yet call Themselves God's Servants, knowing not that He Escheweth these Things, being like a Child In Meekness and Simplicity, but these Are pompbesotted and prideblind, and deem That Wealth and Show find Favor in God's Eyes. And in the Stead of this high Faith which built Cathedrals, bending to the mighty Task Of Love and Duty an whole People's Mind, The persevering Force of Ages thus Embodied to create a fitting Shrine For Him, who tho' in Space He dwells not, yet Might deign to hallow such a Dwellingplace! The Faith that planted in the Soul of Man An infinite Love, infinite like itself, For all Things beautiful and holy: not A barren Love, but still in Word and Deed Prolific: not a bounded Love, to Hope And Fear, to Chance and Change allied, but all- Embracing, boundless, limitless as Air! The Faith that gave us Men who still fulfilled Unswervingly their Being's End, who knew No Rest save in their Task, and no Reward Sought or desired save the Consciousness Of working in their great Task master s Eye, Men who passed o 'er this Earth as if their Foot For one brief Moment rested on it as A Steppingstone towards Eternity And nothing more, like Gods, yet lowly as The Child, fulfilling their high Mission and By that absorbed from earthly Cares and Fears! The Faith that gave the Reformation, which By Milton spoke, and made the cruel Flame A Glory to transfigure and sublime! The Faith that gave us Shakespears, Harringtons, Sydneys and Marvels, Men of Faculties Infinite, for that they felt was infinite, And in Infinitude they lived and died. And for this lofty Faith, this genuine Breath Of Inspiration coming from on high What have we substituted in the Pride And Folly of our Hearts? can Mechanism Accomplish or create aught for the Soul, Th' illimitable Soul? can it call forth The Spirit of eternal Wisdom from Its mystic Depths within the Heart of Man? Can it create those Forms of Loveliness Which from the Poet's Brain spring into Life, Aerial Shapes scarce touching this dim Earth On which they walk? can Mechanism blend The vast and many Discrepancies of Man 's individual Will into one high And holy Purpose, one likeminded Hope And Effort before which the Thrones of Kings Are but as Bubbles to the onward Wave? Is Love more beautiful in these dull Days Than when Andromache on Hector's Breast, Threethousand Years ago, her beating Heart Laid in its Womansfondness, and a Tear Started into the hardy Warrior's Eye As o 'er the Good and Beautiful he bent His manly Brow, and in the Shadow stood, But for a Moment, of the coming Grief, Then straightway in the Light of his own Soul, (Like to the Sun emerging from a Cloud,) Moved on in calm and sublime Confidence, Prepared alike to suffer or to do, As the Gods willed or as his Country ask'd! Is Courage nobler now than when upon The Persian Hosts Leonidas looked down And felt a solemn Joy to think that he By Fate was chosen for the Sacrifice? Is Faith more ardent than when Latimer From 'midst the Flames sent forth those Prophetwords, And gave his Body as a Faggot to The Fire, the divine Fire which first warmed This Nation's Heart unto celestial Things? Oh Fools! the Heart of Man is as it beat In Adam 's Breast, ye cannot add one Pulse Or alter it a Tittle, and his Soul, For all that ye can do, will never look Beyond the Moment which lies dim and dark, Dark as the farthest Future in its Way! Still must it trust and hope, still with the Staff Of Faith in sublime Confidence move on, Content to feel in Sorrow and in Joy That which it is not given us to know, How greater are we than we seem, yea! than Ourselves can comprehend, for in us dwells A God tho' but as yet revealed in Part, Of whom our Souls a Revelation are, Whose Presence we can feel but not explain: Content if, doubting not, we thus become More than we seem yet less than what we are! Conscious, yet knowing not the why or how! Can ye be more than this, than godlike, then? Ye Fools! by Mechanism ye may clothe Your Backs with costlier Raiment and may fill Your Bellies with the good Things of the Earth, But here ye stop! ye cannot add one Hue To the least Flower of the Field or make The Violet's Perfume sweeter, how much less, Oh how much less, ye Fools, can ye then add A Tittle to the Soul which is of God! And God, if ye could feel him but in it! How much less can ye make the Beautiful Which haunts the inmost Soul more beautiful, The True more true, the Divine more divine! 'Tis He who first created it alone Can change its Nature and unfold its Wings, Those hidden Angelswings the Wish to spread Out which and soar away alone we feel, Vain Yearnings without Power so to do! Ye cannot pluck a Dayseye from the Grass And bid another spring up in its Place, Oh how much less then from the human Heart Can ye remove one Feeling, or replace The Holiness, the Freshness if once lost! Ye would take Clay and like a Potter mould The Heart of Man therewith and fashion it In Mammon's Likeness and from it efface The Image of its Maker; but, thank God! These Things are placed far, far beyond your Reach! Then toil and sweat, your Works are Nothingness, Dust, Dust, and with them shall ye be forgot! But if ye be so great as yourselves boast, Do but this Miracle, replace the Dew Within the Flower, or to that which is The least of Nature's Works add but some Gift, Some Property whereby it may fulfill Better the End for which God called it forth, And then, ye Fools, I will have Faith in ye, Believe that Nature erred and ye are right! This Faith which ye have lost, the Heritage Bequeathed by mighty Spirits who were heard Preaching in olden Time the one grand Truth, That in the Soul of Man all Happiness, All Powers of Being dwell, is not to be RegainÃ«d thus: ye must go back I say Unto the primal Sympathies and these Must cherish and enlarge untill they bear The good old Fruits again, but if ye forge Chains for yourselves e'en from that very Thought Which still should set ye free, ye are lost Men; For ye no more this blessÃ«d Sun can shine, The green Hills greet ye not, this pleasant Earth Can send into your Souls no Sense of Joy, No sweet Perceptions of that Love which so Ungrudgingly with its own Blessedness, As with an Atmosphere, all Things surrounds: Ye cannot kneel beneath the brightblue Cope Of Heaven, as in a Temple, and to Him Who made it lift the Song of Thanks and Praise: Ye shall be of the Herd that daily treads The City's Streets, unwearied in the Search Of Mammon who there reigns supreme o'er Men Degraded to the Likenesses of Brutes! Ye may be shrewd, for Life to ye is but A Plotting and a Tricking, not the so, So sublime Sphere wherein the Christian forms His Soul and fashions it to godlike Things: Who simple as a Child (and like it too Setting more Store by the least Flower of The Field than all Earth's Pelf, and rightly too, For 'tis God's Work and clearly of him speaks, Clearer than ye tho' with his own divine Intelligence endowed,) becomes to ye An easy Dupe, a Scoff and Byword! ye May pile your Moleheaps cunningly, and in Your narrow Sphere with microscopic Ken Outwit the Wiseman gazing at the free And ample Sky above him, towards which as He onward moves, o'er ye and your vain Works He steps and sees ye not, for his high Soul Looks down on ye as on the crawling Worm, Tho' crawling that fulfills its End and is But in its destined Place, tho' ye are not! Ye shall be of those dimeyed Slaves who ne'er Have gazed in Rapture at the chrystal Arch Of Heaven's vast Dome when on the Eveningclouds The Sun has painted glorious Imagery, Â«Fortunate FieldsÂ» where blessÃ«d Spirits rove, Floating amid the liquid Ether, like Those Â«happy IslesÂ» which erst the Soul of Man Placed in th' Atlantic Main 'mid unknown Waves, Yearning towards a higher Dwellingplace By Instinct ineffaceable, that burned With steady Light thro' all the Mists of Doubt In Fable and in Fiction: kept alive By Poet sage, who with the holy Warmth Of high Imagination cherished still A Truth dull Reason would not comprehend! Into due Sense of which the lively Greek By happy Chance surprized, or rather, led By Nature's divine Hand, caught Glimpses bright Of Glory yet undreamt, clear Openings up Into Eternity, as when thro' Clouds A sudden Sunburst clears a Vista bright Into the Bosom of the farthest Sky, Celestial Vision! which, tho' snatched away Ere we can say Â«it isÂ», suffices to Awake the primal Instinct of the Soul. Thricehappy Greek! whom cold, material Laws Enslaved not to the Bondage of brute Sense! Still true to Nature, she repay'd thy Trust By leading thee thro' Blessedness and Love, And healthy Sympathies, to highest Truths; For never has she failed the loving Heart Whose quiet Pulse thrills at the Song of Bird Or Voice of natural Joy, that with all Things, As Coinheritors of one same Life, Has shared its Sympathies; she still upholds, Exalts and purifies, thro' Ear and Eye Enlarges Faith's Domain, infusing thus Into the Heart Sensations sweet and pure, And Sentiments of Thankfulness for Bliss So largely spread abroad, until the Soul, To which so many Sources of Delight Are opened up, grows eager to repay By giving Joy the Joy which it receives; 'Till Love grows Adoration, 'till it grows Into a comprehensive Consciousness Of its so divine Source, of God! for he Who feels Love must feel God, since He is Love, Feels Him too thus in His own purest and Most godlike Form, in which He most is God! Thus haply when beneath the chrystal Cope Of his own cloudless Sky, as in a vast And natural Temple, pillared up by Hills And roofed with the blue Dome of Heav'n itself, Or haply when the passing Rainbow's Arch, With skyembracing Span, rose o'er his Head As built by unseen Spirits, when 'mid Forms In which the Power of the living God Is shadowed forth, with Ear and Eye supplied On all sides with clear Intuitions, with Signs numberless and Proofs, in outward Things As in his own Perceptions, a deep Sense Of some pervading Presence, alldiffus'd, Felt in the Air, in Nature's calm, deep Joy, And in the Beatings of his Heart: when thus At some high Festival, met to award The Laurelcrown of Immortality, (All Things thus tending to force on his Thought The one grand Truth, of which that evergreen Wreath was the visible Emblem, growing thence As from the Root that kept it ever fresh, And only as a Symbol of which it Was deemed of Worth) when thus he heard the Voice Of Poet singing of the olden Time, Exalting Memory to an Act of Faith, And holding up unto eternal Praise The Deed heroic and the high Contempt Of Death and Suffering, and who, as 'round Him gathered thousands listened, gave unto And caught from all those many Hearts, as 't were Identified with his and speaking by His Lips, the grand Conviction which Men in Large Masses feel sublimely, and which as God's Presence awes, controuls, and binds in one, And makes Mankind Mankind! oh surely then His Aspirations were a holy Heat In which all meaner Sentiments consumed And lost fed but the Flame of pure Belief. Think ye that he whose Eye by Love made clear And Faith, scarce known unto himself, could see The Forms of spiritual Beings by The Elements, as with a Garment, clothed, The Oread on some distant Mountainside, An airy Presence out of Sunbeams wrought And Clouds, which blending, alternating swift, Left Fancy free to coin her Fairyshapes. Think ye that he whose Hand, by holy Awe Withheld and Veneration for the Spot, Would never pluck a Branch from the tall Oak Whose antique Shade the Dryad loved to haunt: That he who, ere unto the gushing Spring He bent his thirsty Lip, first offered up A grateful Prayer unto the Guardiannymph, Who sometimes, if the Votary had Faith, Half rose from out the chrystal Wave to bless His mortal Vision and then disappeared: Think ye that he who thus in Detail made All Things to sympathize with his own Faith, Who gave a Soul and Principle of Life Even to senseless Forms, forefeeling tru- Ly as sublimely the great God in all, And anxious by the Fancy's divine Aid T adorn and bring still nearer to the Heart This vital Truth: nor yet content, strove to Combine these scattered Gleams of divine Light Into a still more spiritual Form, A pure Conception of essential Being, Felt in the Yearnings of the human Heart, And in the breathing Air, and in each Pulse Of alldiffusÃ«d Life, in great and small, As that by which they live and without which There is no Being, Happiness or Life, The universal Pan! who himself is The millionpulsing Soul of this wide World, Who like the Air encompasses all Things And interpenetrates, upholds, maintains, All Modes of Being, felt by each as what Is highest in it, as its Law and End: The Uniondeity, the All-in-All, In whom these Detailessences, each Pulse Of spiritual Being was summed up As in th' including Whole! think ye that he Who by his Heart and Fancy rose thus high Above the Shackles of this sensual Life, And breathed, to all Intents and Purposes, If we look calmly to the Heart of Things, The Ether of Man's spiritual Life, Think ye that he was less expressly made In God's own Image, less erect than ye, Or that God placed him in a lower Rank Of rational Existence, that his Heart Was harder or his Eye and Ear more dull Than yours, who deem it Waste of Time to lift Your Brows up to the loveliest Sky that e'er Made the Soul yearn for Immortality? Ye who, (with Hearts that in the glorious Forms Of Nature recognize no kindred Spirit, No Pulse that beats in Unison with yours, Nor e'en the divine Hand which on the least, Least Flower of the Field has left its Trace!) Look briefly up, then turning to the Dust Which ye have grovelled in until your Souls Are parched and vile as it, exclaim in Scorn At the poor Â«FoolÂ» who loitering on his Way Drinks from the glorious Vision, sway'd as by The Breath of God himself, pure Draughts of Life And sweet Forgetfulness of passing Griefs, Â«They are but Clouds at which the Idiot stares, Poor pennyless Wretch, when he had better think How he shall fill his PurseÂ»! yea! verily, They are but Clouds, as baseless as a Dream, A little Vapor by the Sunbeams hued, Into thin Air soon melting all away, Nor more nor less! yet if a passing Cloud Can fill the Eye with Tears of holy Joy, The Heart with Thankfulness, the Soul with Faith, Better it were to gaze upon that Cloud Barefooted and bareheaded, than to roll In Luxury and Wealth and see it not! 'Tis but a Cloud which from th' eternal Blue Fades and is lost, by Chymistry resolved Into a little Gas! and what is all Your boasted Wealth before th' eternal God? And into what will He resolve it all, That greatest Chymist! who resolves all Things To their real Elements? is it then worth More than that Cloud? no, no, not half so much! For it awakes not one, one godlike Thought Within your Hearts, while that can call up Tears Of Bliss and fill it with the Sense of God! And oh! believe me, that which can do this, That must be godlike, natural and true, To do so, for naught, naught can speak of Him But what is true unto its End and Use: Then were your Wealth so it would do the same, But it is dumb! then cast it from ye, for If it were godlike it would make ye so! Ye call the Greek a Heathen! why?âbecause Ye mouthe the Gospel as a Dog a Bone From which no Good can come, and go to Church And stand at the Streetcorners and pray loud, Then rob the Orphan of his scanty Mite To swell your Overmeasure! but the Lord Is good and just, he gives the Burthen and He knows the Bearer's Strength: then if the Greek Without the Gospel has done more than ye, Ye Hypocrites, that very Light ye boast Condemns ye, yea! the Wisdom which ye claim, That very Wisdom is your Stumblingblock! But Wisdom knows ye not, for she is one With Truth, Religion, and all lofty Things, Of all her Children is she justified, Then surely among these ye cannot be: And without Wisdom Freedom too is but An idle Name, for he who is not wise Unto Salvation neither is he free! For in the spiritual Life of Man All Freedom dwells: but spiritual Life Is none, unless we live in and from God! All outward Circumstance and passing Form Are then but as the Clouds which o'er the Sun Pass, and receiving all, to him give naught! Who will may everywhere be free, the Lord Of amplest Sovereignty, vaster than Eye grasps within its Ken and fairer far! Accountable to none save God alone, And owning but one Law, the godlike, which, By being godlike he fulfills too best! Yea! 'neath the worst of Tyrannies he's free, A Citizen of a rightnoble State, Whose Charter was established and confirmed Ere the Foundations of the Hills were laid, Far deeper and more durable than they! He is a Freeman too, and not because He holds some paltry Space of this brute Earth, Which is not free, and has no Priviledge To make or set free, but because he holds A Patent from Allmighty God! a Soul That is and dares to be true to itself, Keeping its Birthright as a holy Thing For which the World has no equivalent! The Sanctions of that Law by which he claims His Freedom are derived direct from God, Not graven upon perishable Brass But in the Heart, there ineffaceable: And of their Tenor not one Letter may Be altered, nor can Change of Time and Place Aught lessen their eterne Authority: To Black and White, beneath the torrid Clime Or at the icy Pole, they are the same! Not to wormeaten Parchments, not to Laws Of human Institution or to Rights Forced from proud Despots by the chaingalled Serf Is he indebted for his Liberty! These are but idle Forms, a narrow Base Whereon to rear the noble Edifice Of genuine Independence, dear alone To him who, ignorant of what he is And whence he comes, is still content to owe Life's highest Blessing to an Equal's Hand, A Creature like himself: who looks upon The Birthright of his Soul but as a Boon Of changeful Time, an Acquisition made And hallowed by Tradition, tho' herself But his frail Daughter, having neither Right Nor Power to establish and confirm Upon the Basis of eternal Truth The Heritage she brings! these are mere Forms And worthless in his Eyes, for Liberty Is underived, not borrowing from these Her divine Rights but giving unto them Their Meaning and Significance: they are But varying Modes in which from Age to Age The undimm 'd Truth still reappears amid Earth's grosser Elements, 'till casting off All foreign Mixture and Alloy it breaks Forth in its Purity upon Mankind! He looks beyond this Earth, where Race to Race, And Generation unto Generation, like Waves by new Waves effaced unceasingly, Succeed eachother, looks beyond all this, Up to the God who having given Man A Portion of his o wn pure Soul, therewith, Included necessÃ rily in it As the Scent in the Rose, bestowed likewise All that is godlike, therefore Freedom too Among the rest, and which in his own Right He of his Father claims so long as he Is godlike, for if not he for feits it! What matter Revolutions then to him, And Rights and Charters? or what can he gain That he has not already in a far, Far purer Form, or how extend one Jot His Freedom when as wide as Thought itself, As hard to be infringed on and destroyed? He feels that he is free, by other Right Than Statesman e'er invented, of a far, Far nobler Commonwealth, whereof he is A worthy Citizen approved by Truth! Not from an Equal's Hand deigns he to take His divine Birthright when by God's own Hand 'Tis proffered to him, knowing well that Kings As easily might breathe the Breath of Life Into a Deadman's Nostrils as confer The Boon of Freedom on their meanest Thrall! A greater than the Â«magna ChartaÂ» gives Him his high Priviledge, strikes from his Soul The inward Chains and purifies it 'till A Temple worthy of the living God, God condescends to dwell in it, and in It entering, appropriates it to Himself and fills it with his divine Light! There are no Bonds for him! Hand cannot forge The Fetters that shall hold him or build up His Prisonwalls! ye might as well believe To bind the living God himself as take One Tittle from his Birthright! in his Chains He is more free, a thousand Times more frce Than those who thus constrain him: yea! e'en then, Oh ye of little Faith, I say, there comes A radiant Angel, robed in Heavenslight, To strike his Chains off, and to lead him forth Into his Father's Kingdom, as of old Appeared unto St Peter in the Dead Of Night, when Sword and Spear lay nerveless in The Hands that watched him, impotent and vain As their own Shadows! yea! I say, he's free, He can fulfill his Being be he where He may, in Prison as at Liberty, For from itself the Soul draws all its Good, And he who is a Law unto himself None violates nor needs! but how can Law Or outward Circumstance make free the Man Who is the Slave of a depravÃ«d Will, Who has no Law within himself nor knows Why God created him! âMy Countrymen, What matters it that at your own good Will Ye frame your Laws, if still the Fountainhead Be of unwholesome Waters, that you have High Priviledges and Facilities, If ye want Wisdom to apply aright These precious Blessings, which are yet but so As each Man's Virtue makes them, else naught but Mere empty and highsounding Forms to cheat The selffooled Spirit, which to its vain Pride Thus offers up a savoury Sacrifice! What tho' your Fieldwalks spite the grasping Hand Of Wealth, who grudges to the poor man e'en Free Passage o'er God's blessed Earth as if 'Twere consecrate to his proud Foot alone, Be open to the Peasant as the King; What tho' ye be as free as Heavensbreath To blow on whom ye please, or as the Lark In the blue Sky to utter what ye feel: What tho' ye bear no foreign Shackles on Your freeborn Limbs which like the blessÃ«d Air May roam thro' every Nook of this dear Isle Unquestioned, unreproved, if in yourselves Ye be not free? think not that Freedom lies Within his Reach who's wedded to this Earth, To its vain Pomps and Shows, he is a Slave, For Mammon claims his Due, and not for naught Serves he his Votaries! we have become A moneyloving, wealthencumbered Race, And gilded Vice is decent in our Eyes, For this we live, we write, make War and die! He who would win the Favours of the World Must by Compliance with her Humours seek To sway her Will, must pander to her Tastes And worship her according to her Ways, By her own Guiles must win her; thus by Crime Must the Rootcrime be nourished, 'till it spread Its baleful Shades above the Nation which Beneath it harbours! they who plant must pluck The Fruit of their own Sowing: still Unright By selfbegetting Evil is maintained, And like must follow like until the Cloud Of gathered Evil has discharged its Wrath Above the offending Head. thus Ill to Ill Succeeds, 'till in Fate's surecast Net immeshed, Nations, like Individuals, are taught To do no Wrong! and when some Afterrace, Warned by the mighty Teacher, Time, who throws Light on th' Enigma-page of bygone Days, Crime's dread Sphynxriddle, which to Ruin leads And Selfperdition all who have not learnt By divine Truth to solve it and to turn Their Wisdom to Account, thus when, tho' late, Some Afterrace would expiate old Sins, Still the unfailing Forfeit must be pay 'd, The fearful Heritage which they receive From their Forefathers' Errors, and that too With all the gathered Interest of Years: Justice is even with us still at last! And when too late we would restore their Rights To those whom we have injured, that same Act This Passage refers to our Conduct to India: the Subjugation and Oppression of a Nation for the Sake of wringing Wealth and Luxury from its Misery, is alike against the Order of Nature and the Law of God: one Sin must always be maintained by another, thus the first Act of Oppression compelled its Perpetrators to follow it up by checking all Enlightenment, wellknowing that the Darkness of their own Deeds could not coexist with the Light of Truth, thus have they perverted the most sublime Occasion of enlightening a Nation into an Instrument of its Degradation and their own: often have I mourned that so many Pages of our History should be stained with Blood and Tears which might be grand Chapters inscribed to Love and Justice! had England done her Duty, her Name would be hailed at this Hour in India with Delight, and by the godliest of all Means, Love and Gratitude, would she easily maintain what is insecurely upheld by brute Force; then would a Word of her Mouth accomplish by divine Constraint what the Might of Armies would be unequal to! still however the moral Machinery of the World selfcorrects these Anomalies, and from our Crimes elicits their Punishment!â Applies the selfmade Scourge to our own Backs: Thus are the Fathers' Misdeeds punished in Their Childrenschildren, sure however late! Alas! that those who sowed the Seed would think On what the Crop must bring forth: prosperons Days and Treasures flowing in may blunt the Edge Of sorrowkeen Reflection, but Success Like this is vengeancesent and falls upon A Nation like a sudden Blindness, in Which as one vast Blindman it gropes upon The Brink of Selfperdition, whence the least Blow or Selfdistrust plunges it headlong, A Warning and Example! Afterwoes Are but the Shadows which upon the Heels Of Crime their Substance followâthese sometimes Are cast before and warn ere yet they wrap A Nation's Soul in Mourning; 'tis as if the Shadow of the evil One were thrown Upon his Victim from afar, ere he Himself draws near and seizes on his Prey! ThricecursÃ«d Wealth! thou hast so soiled our Minds That e'en Philosophy, who should unteach These souldebasing Sophistries, degrades Herself to be the Pander to a Lie, Teaching theÂ» Wealth of NationsÂ» as it were A Merchantsledgerreckoning, a base And sordid Summing up of Pounds and Pence! And art thou sunk thus low, my Country, art Thou come to this? to set thy Heart on Things which are but as the Dust beneath our Feet, By which we measure Knaves and Fools, for these Cannot distinguish seeming Goods from real, The one thro' Folly and the others thro' Corrupted Will, thus Vice is Folly too, And the Knave is both Knave and Fool at once! Is this thy Wealth? thou in whose favored Tongue Sages and Seers gave Oracles: wherein A Shakespear and a Milton wrote, and which God himself chose to speak by Lips he loved! Are these thy Treasures? thou to whom Time's Page Bequeaths such Wealth of holy Memories, Thou who in Fredom's sacred Cause hast shed Thine own Veinsblood, and offered at her Shrine Names which should be as Watchwords to all Time! I cannot think that thou art sunk so low, So selfdegraded, yet how fallen off From that which Poets and Historians paint! From those bright Days when generous Love could bind In high Familiarity, in free Communion of Soul and Selfrespect More Hearts than cursÃ«d Gold dissevers now: Sowing base Jealousies and paltry Hates, Vain Discontents and Struggles to outdo In Things where 'tis disgraceful to be first! Where each Man, selfdissatisfied with that Which Providence assigns or Labour earns, Scorns his own State, tho' in it Wisdom might Find ample Scope and Room enough for Bliss, And will be miserable, wretched Thrall Of others' Thoughts, not daring to be what God made him, but the Ape at secondhand Of other Apes, as tho' he were not free To wear the Heart within his Breast, to breathe, Feel, speak, or act, save when exampled by Due Precedent to tread where others trod, Who will not use his own, because, forsooth! His nextdoor Neighbour is a richer Man, An o'ergrown Child 'mid Toys that please no more, Pampered and babyed upon Overwealth! What is this Wealth which neither gives Content, Nor Wisdom, Selfrespect, nor Worth, nor Peace? Which at our Death is squandered to our Shame By Knaves or Fools, by which too one Man bribes Another's Honesty or buys his Way To the first Honors of a worthless State, Which thus exalts its Vices that they may Scourge it with Crimes and Follies as is meet, 'Till the Shamecup be filled! Awake once more, My Country dear! for in thy grassy Lap Thou bear'st the Pledge of glorious Deeds which must Not be belied, but yield the promised Fruit According to the Stock whereof they come! The Dust of those who suffered at the Stake Is mingled with thine Earth, that holy Earth Not made for slavish Feet, and God who knows The Future suffers not such Seed to die. Think ye that Latimer and Ridley gave Their Lives but for the passing Hour? no! They died to serve the Future and with ye Their Spirits, viewless Fellowworkmen! still Cooperate, pass into, quicken your Own Hearts, with your own Thoughts and Hands assist Each godlike Undertaking, unto whom They, as the noblest Heritage, bequeathed Their Lives and their Examples, which become A Curse or Blessing as ye yourselves make! The Reformation's Seed sprung from their Blood, A precious Harvest from a precious Soil Which God has blessed and quickened! then once more Arise, the Vineyard now is ready for The Labourers and each is worth his Hire; A greater Reformation still must be, Reform ye your ownselves, and consecrate Your Souls as Temples unto Truth, who loves The human Heart, disdaining meaner Shrines, An unwalled Temple vaster far than Dome, Cathedralpile or Heav'n itself! and 'till This Reformation be wrought out, in vain Your Laws and Constitutions will ye change. There is a Light beyond the Light of Day, And as athwart this dim, nightmantled Earth The Sunrays stream, an unseen Flood of pure, Clear Radiance towards the far off Moon, so too This better Light from Age to Age and from One Land unto another, tho' oft un- Observed, unknown, across the changing Mists Of Time its divine Radiance pours upon A Nation's Soul, and from its sublime Face The old Light breaks, the Light, the Spirit of The living God, as from the Moon thro' all Her Changes the unseen Sun's Light, 'till full, Full opposite she stands and godlike shines Near bright as he, yet still but by his Light! So too Mankind! when at its greatest Height And Fullness of Perfection, it returns Unto the Bosom of its God, comple- Ting thus its destined Cycle, as the Moon At Full gives back her Light unto the Sun! But when its Soul grows earthly, dark Mists rise Betwixt it and its Source, and it receives That Light no more, then wanes the Nation's Strength And Glory with it, like a sapless Tree! Then cherish ye this Light, let it not be Extinguished in your Hearts, but kindle there- At Education's holy Flame and let The Sparks be scattered far and wide, that so Our Souls, like to the Stars of Heaven, may Give Light unto eachother! then once more Shall Echos of the good, old Days be heard, And Milton's Name be mightier than the Glaive To punish and defend, redeem and free!

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. ON WELLDOING. 1. When thou hast done a Gooddeed do not show It with thy Finger, neither let it be Profaned: else it will come back unto thee Like to a handled Flower, where the Glow Of Hue, and Sweetness of the Perfume no More dwell: upon God's Altar, with all the First Freshness on it, place it, and then he Will make its Perfume everlasting, so 'Twill be a Joy for aye: there are but two To whom it matters that thy Deeds be known: God and thyself: and if to these alone They be so, then rejoice thereat, for you Thus know them to be Gooddeeds, in the true And sublime Senseâtrue, like thy Father's own! 2. And he will recompense thee fully: by Thy Feelingsâhe will make these godlikeâyea, Thou shalt feel even as God himself may! And how can he reward thee, save thro' thy Own Feelings? can the Godlike palpably Make itself known in any other Way? And if thou feel'st not thyself godlike, pray Can it pass into thee by Ear or Eye? Then fear notâif thou aught Godlike hast done, Thou canst not miss of one Reward, the bestâ Thy Feelingsâin which each has a sure Test. For where these are not Godlike first, there none Can do aught Godlikeâwhere they are so, rest Assured that each a full Reward has won: There is none else for him beneath the Sun. Nay, could he wish another, then what he Has done would be no more Godlike: thus the Mere Doing Good its own Reward implies, For we must feel Godlike to do it!âso, So surely, unto Virtue the allwise Creator joins its Recompense below! 3. Then do thou Good like to thy Father up In Heaven! so, so stilly, modestly, That what thy Righthand does thine upraised Eye Behold not! so, that when thou hold'st the Cup To the poor Beggar, thou feel'st not that thy, But God's, Hand gives it: and then verily If thou feel'st thus, 'twill be no longer thine: 'Twill be thy Father's, holding the divine And brimming cup of Love, as well to thee As to that Beggar: and the Draught shall be A Foretaste of that Heaven which is nigh, So nigh! as is the Tear unto thine Eye, The godlike Feeling to thine Heart! do as Thy Father then, who lets us work the Good And Godlike as if of ourselves it was, And not of Him! who asks for nothing: no Not e'en the Thanks which all Things to Him owe: E'en for the Good himself does in us:âthus In doing Good he with the godlike Thought Of doing it is paid, nor seeks for aught Beyond: and if he were not this Way by Himself repaid, how could he worthily Or by whom be rewardedâ? it is this That makes him God, and sums up all his Bliss! All Joy he feels, all Good done doth he do, And yet a measurelessly greater too! His own, which makes him what he only is! POWER OF IMAGINATION 1 Does not the Fancy fondly fain 'Twixt Spirits bound by Faith and Love, A magic and electric Chain By which two Hearts one Impulse prove? 2 Yes, and to Hearts that love indeed No idle Tale sweet Fancy tells, Such Power is true Love's holy Meed, For Faith can still work Miracles. 3 Let not the dull, cold Sons of Earth, Deride the Mysteries of Love, They must be born to a new Birth, Ere such base Hearts this Truth can prove, 4 For Truth speaks but to willing Ears, To such as listen holily, She has no Voice for Man's dull Sneers, But leaves him in his Pride to die. 5 âTis on Imagination's Wings The Soul can traverse Time and Space, Away all Dust of Earth it flings, That severed Hearts may thus embrace. 6 Praise be to God for this high Power, This Balm against the Ills of Life, By which e'en Absence' bitter Hour, Some Honey to the Hive may give. 7 And sweeter too than that we gain From Flowers which in no sharp Thorns lie, For Bliss thus won from sinless Pain Is doubly dear to Memory. 8 When in far foreign Lands I roam, And Strangerfaces coldly stare, On Fancy's wings I hie me Home, And pass an Hour of Rapture there. 9 I close my Eyesâthe Present's gone, And thro' my stirred Heart's inmost Core There sweeps a sweet and thrilling Tone Of wellcome Voices, heard of Yore. 10 Once more upon my Threshold dear I stand, in throbbing Joy elate: And half in Hope and half in Fear, I lift the Latch, yet hesitate. 11 For from that loved and hallowed Spot I've parted many a long, long Year, And some may beâoh God! be what?â Away dark Thought: thou art Despair! 12 One moment, and they're gathered all Around me with their Looks of Joy, And my full Heart doth rise and fall, As tho' its Bliss were Agony. 13 From many a wistful Eye is cast Those wholeheart Thoughts that cannot speak: For much is changed since they met last, And Care sits on the oncefair Cheek. 14 Fancy, thou stirr'st too potently Mine earthlier Part, deceiving Elf: The starting Tear and heaving Sigh Call me from thee to my sole Self. 15 I have no Home, save when past Times Steal o'er me with their Visions dear: And of remembered Joys the Chimes Come ringing back in Fancy's Ear. 16 I have no Home! oh Time! oh Time! Why hast thou robbed me of my Home? Thrust me from that fair Edenclime, Like Adam, thro' the World to roam? 17 My Mother's Voice I hear no more, And could it speak to soothe my Grief, Alas! it has no longer Power; It would but wound, not bring Relief. 18 I have a Corner in my Heart Where the old Feelings still live on, But lost, beyond all human Art, The World of Beauty, that is gone! 19 Oh Mother! thou canst no more kiss My Lips, and with thy Angeltouch Make me an Angel too of Bliss, If not in Form, in Heart still such. 20 Once more on Earth; my sweet Dream's flown, But Faith has still a Remedy, She loves with her own Wreath to crown Grief's pale Brow, suffering patiently. 21 With bendÃ«d knee and upraised Eye, My Sorrows all to her are given, And, like a Seraph, from the Sky Hope drops and lifts my Thoughts to Heaven, 22 Thus in the Agony of Parting From those we love on Earth the best, Let's think upon the Bliss of meeting, Where severed Hearts at length have Rest. ON PLEASURESEEKING. 1. The Fool of Fools is he who in the Chace Of Pleasure sweats and slaves: who toils from Day To Day, and vainly, 'till his head grows gray, And he sinks down exhausted by the Race, Which Mind and Body should but serve to brace, For what already each Step of the Way Was in his Reach, would he but think so: say How shall we then hold fast in our Embrace The everfleeting Form of Pleasureâto Be easypleased makes Pleasure everywhere: But to be so, we must first set a true Value on Things, know what they really are. Our Disappointments spring from our undue Esteem of fancied Goods, which sought with Care Do not repay the Search: nay, often too 2. The Search unfits us for Enjoyment, by Its feverish Longing and Anxiety. Make thyself easy first to please, then thou Wilt not wait long for what thou seekÃ«st now With so much Toil: be pleased with all Things, e'en With merest Trifles, for if thou art so, What matters it then what the Cause has been? It is no Trifle unto thee, altho' To others: 'tis the grand Mistake to throw Small Things away; the Fool therein can find No Good, for there is none in his own Mind. But thou art wiser, and thou know'st that all Is goodâthat, grandly viewed, no Thing is small! PRAYER. As to my Father oft do I pray un- To God, and ever does he answer me: The Prayer is its best Answer, it is the Fullfillment of its ownself, 'twould be none If otherwise! and even when that one Good which we ask at His Hands may not be Accorded us, yet something better He Gives for it, so godlike he gives alone! The greatest Blessing is to hold none for The greatest, but to labour to possess God only, in all Things to do his Law. Now this chief Good in his Ungrudgingness He gives to all alike, for Eye ne'er saw Nor Heart e'er felt the Godlike except thro' And by Him, thus possessed by all, who do Feel that, in his sublime Unchangeableness! This one Good compensates us for all less- Er Losses, nay! with it there are none too! For in Him we have still our dear Ones, who Relive to us by this one Blessedness! Which thus is all in one, and the one true! Then let us merge ourselves in God and naught Can we be robbed of, nay, that which is ta'en From us shall be made fairer and again Thro' feeling Him more godlike to us brought Back, and possessed enduring as our Thought! ON SELFISHNESS. If Men act selfishly towards thee do Not let that make thee selfish: let it be A Spur to further Good, that all may see Thus thy Disinterestedness, unto Still greater Sacrifices, 'till that thro' Constant Selfsacrifice it grow to thee None, as to God, who gives all and so free- Ly, even his own Spirit! and have you Not still a full Reward e'en when Men pay Thee with Ingratitude? hast thou not still Thy godlike Feelings, pure Heart and strong Will? Then do not Good alone, but go, I say, One, one Step further, pardon those who ill- Requite thee, let the Injury pass away, Like to a Cloud from yon' eternal Blue, So from thy Soulâfor as that Cloud the Day, So ill Thoughts bar the spiritual Ray Of God's own Lightâthus, like Him, wilt thou do Good for itself, and like Him pardoning too Thine Enemies will have none more, nor see In their Ingratitude the Ill done thee But that alone which to themselves is done, For if thou thinkÃ«st thus to thee is none! TO THE POOR. Poor Man, lift up thy Brow, thy Wealth is great, Thy Heritage most kingly, tho' to thee Its full Extent unknown! I would not be A Monarch in his Pomp and Pride of State If I might chuse 'twixt that and thy hard Fate! Look up, look up, for art thou not as free To call God Father then as well as he? Yea! more so, and is thy Reward tho' late Not certain? why into the Dust shouldst thou Then look still down? thou hast like him a Brow Whereon God's Image is impressed as clear: Thou hast an Heart whose Beatings let thee know Thine Immortality: tho' destined here With Sweat to earn thy Bread yet not less near To God for this, nay! nearer, for 'tis so He as the Father to thee must appear: 'Tis to the Sufferer that He doth grow All that He is, unutterably dear! MONEYLUST. What first, what second, and what third? Money! Still Money! grow but rich and thou shalt be A shining Light to all Mankind, airfree From every Speck and Stain quick Slander's Eye Detects 'neath threadbare Clothes and Poverty, Tho' in a blessÃ«d Saint! Oh God, that we From this soulsoiling Moneyleprosy, Base Thralls! could free ourselves, with Hearts to high And genuine Sentiments reclaimed, no more Slaving for that which wise Men fling away, As Life's chief Good! Oh! what is to be poor? In Wealth to wallow 'till Truth's heavenly Sway And high Affections lose their genial Power, Leaving us allunmixed, untempered Clay! BLESSINGS, HOW EARNED? Great Blessings ask a wise Forbearance, a Calm Selfdenial; if too soon we would Enjoy their Sweets, we lessen that same Good Which, ripening in due Season, they would lay Of themselves at our Feet, as in our Way The ripest, sweetest Apples fallâwe should Not pluck the Fruittreesblossoms in a Mood Of Overhaste, to smell and fling away That without which the Fruit can never be: 'Tis but a fleeting Pleasure, for which we Thus sacrifice the lasting one: and oh! My Soul, wait God's good Time, thus surest the Good hoped for will be thineâand if not so! Yet hast thou lived so long, and dost not know That when God gives a Blessing to us, he Gives not that which we thought of always; no! We must deserve it firstâand then, when by Patience we have done this, it comes, and lo! We reap two godlike Goods for one alone! And what if of the Blessings prayed for none Should come to pass?-God does in Love deny; Yet such his Bounty that he bestows on Us the divinest of all which the sky Contains, which is all others summed in one, Patience! since waiting for the Blessing which We hoped, that very waiting makes us rich, And not that which we prayed for; nay it makes Us tenfold richer than that could: it is A real, a during Good for life, but this Is oft a fancied, fleeting oneâthen see, My Heart, how much God does for our sole sakes, And let thy Gratitude proportioned be; Do for his Sake the Good and Godlike, so Pure and sublime the true Godlike thou'lt feel and know! Thus even what thou dost for his sake he Takes not to himself, but returns to thee! FREEDOM. There are two Kinds of Liberty, the one I sspiritual, that which Wisemen prize, Which in the narrowest Limits can comprise Powers to work all Good: by which alone The Calmlygreat and the Enduringmighty, on The True and the Eternal bas'd, can rise; Within Man's Breast its ample Empire lies, And on subduÃ«d Will is built its Throne! The other is an outward Thing, of no Worth when disjoined from this: the veriest Slave As the true Freeman its poor Boon may have: 'Tis based upon Distinctions brute and low, On Things allied to chance and change, which owe Their Worth to Fool Opinion's Breath, Dust for the Grave! SOLITUDE. Oh Solitude, divinest Solitude, Long at thy genial Breasts have I drawn in The Milk of Wisdom, far from all vain Din Of the World fretting in its noisy Mood! Longnourished upon that celestial Food, I feel each troubled Pulse which throbbed within My Heart grow quiet, and at length begin To comprehend the sublime Plenitude Of Charms severe that dwell in thy calm Face; No Wonder that the Crowd should pass thee by, Since I myself but now begin to trace Beauties unfelt before: each latent Grace, Revealed alone by perfect Sympathy, When heavenly Things to heavenly reply! A THOUGHT. 1. How happy do I feel this blessed Day, Which comes forth like a Vestal robed in White, And with a Glory on her Head of bright And dazzling Sunbeamsâfor this once I lay Aside Time's heavy Burthen, cast away My Sorrows, as a Snake his Skin, and light- Ly move along, with boyant Heart and Sight Pleased with each Leaflet trembling on its Spray: Life's joyous Spirit is awake in me, Fluttering within my Bosom like a new- Fledged Birdâ Oh Happiness could I but be Ever the same: the inward Harmony Thus calm and perfect, thus to Nature true, As tho' her mighty Hand the full, sweet Accord drew! 2. CONTRAST TO THE ABOVE. I know not wherefore, but e'en now, while near My Lips the Cup of Bliss is sparkling bright As Nectar, held by Hope's own Hand, my Sight Grows dull, and to mine Eye there starts a Tear! The pale Ghost of some halfforgotten Fear Flits dim before my Eyes, and to affright The visionary Forms from Memory's Night Arise, and whispering faintly in my Ear Of Lips which of that Cup should taste with mine, Push it aside, and spill all on the Ground! How oft Man's highest Joy, his most divine Is linked with Pain, as Echo to its Sound! Joy overleaps himselfâ o'ersteps the Bound Which parts them, thus their Essences combine! THE GREATEST POET. 1. He is the truest Poet who will so For his own Heart, and not for others, be! Who makes his daily Life his Poetry, Until this rude, hard World so fair doth show, That Tears seem no more Metaphors of Woe, But like the Dewdrops on the Flower! he, He is the Poet, who can feel and see All Things as God has made them: who can throw His own Heart into Nature's mighty Breast And comprehend its Beatings like his own. Who in the Consciousness supremely blest, Like God, of that which cannot be exprest, And still as he, feels and works out alone Th' Unutterable! his own Heart his best, His sole Reward, and so because unknown! For just because none know of it but he, First then and therefore 'tis all it can be! 2. He for his Verse, from idle Vanity, Breaks off no paltry fragment of his Soul, But keeps the Diamond for his Maker's eye In his own Breast, divinely bright and whole! Perhaps he never rhymed a verse, but his Own Being is a perfect Rhyme in this Grand Poem of the Worldâan Echo clear Of God's own Being, in its smaller Sphere! And if this be not Poetry, I know Not then what is: then God himself is no Poet, for he writes not, but does alone! So poetize thou too, 'till thou hast grown Like him, 'till thy Works show forth only his And not thy Glory: for believe me this Thy highest is, and without this is none! THE WISEMAN CANNOT BE IMPOVERISHED. Talk not of Loss! the Wiseman can lose nought Solong as he is himself! nay, the more He loses of those hollow Goods before Which weak minds bow, the more his Soul is taught That Wealth alone is during which is wrought From his own Bosom's Mine of divine Ore; The more he is himself, the richer Store Springs from the native Soil of his own Thought! 'Tis but when forced into ourselves that we Find and become the Godlike we should be; Then no more upon Fortune's brittle Reed, Shaken by every Breath, we lean, but free And fearless, with Faith's steady staff proceed, Which bears us up secure in Life's worst Need! BOOKWISDOM. 1 Books, Books, like painted Windowglass, Break and discolor Truth's pure Light Which else into our Souls would pass From all Life's Forms, direct and bright 2 We will not see Things as they are, We disjoint and anatomize And sever them, until they bear No meaning to our purblind Eyes. 3 We stick them on our Studyshelf, And then with Spectacles on nose, Pore o'er them, 'till e'en Nature's self A profitless Enigma grows! 4 And by the dim Nightlamp we weigh Opinions jumbled, white and black, Where for one Clue to show the Way A thousand lead us from the Track! 5 And when beneath God's blessed Light We see things as they really are, They dazzle the poor Bookworm's Sight, And colored Glasses he must wear. 6 The World seems in a Whirl; so strange, So rapid, varied, crowded, new Th' Impressions, and so wide the Range Beyond the Circle which he drew, 7 That Magiccircle in which he Dreamt that all Wisdom surely lay, And that beyond it none could see Right by the vulgar Light of Day, 8 Down from the King unto the Clown So different the living Men From that which he before had known, Philosophy's stuffed Specimen! 9 Then he applies to this and that The most approved Booktheory, But finds that it will not come pat When tested by Reality, 10 Philosophy's Airwheel stands still That grinds Abstractions down and chops Up Logic, but plain, hard Facts will Cause Friction, and all Movement stops! AFTER READING WORDSWORTH'S LAODOMIA. Oh godlike Bard, how hast thou roused meâme The godlike; not this common, everyday And hackneyed Being, but the Angel, yea, The Angel I was once, and still should be, And which I grow again in reading thee. Oh that these Feelings could endure for aye, The calm, deep Glanceâthe Consciousnessâthe Ray Of placid Light thrown over all I see. What now I feel and think, I cannot speak! All Utterance, save one alone, is weak; And that is stilly in each Act and Thought To show how deeply upon me hath wrought The Writer's Spirit, so sublime yet meek, The noblest that since Christ his Word has taught; And who, like him too, in his Work has sought God's Glory, not his ownâso do thou seek It too my Soul, and uttering thereof naught, On all the Godlike stamp, with which thou'rt fraught! ON BEING TOLD I COULD NOT LIVE LONG. Thou err'st! thou know'st not how, how many Years I live in each brief Day, nay, in each Hour: Such is Imagination's godlike Power! Life, measured but by fretting Hopes and Fears Of Earth's vain Goods, dark, troubled, brief appears: Its longest Joy, the Smelling at a Flower: Its Griefs, like Shadows lengthening on before And darkening the Tomb, which far off rears Its melancholy Goal! but there is, yea! There is an higher measure, and one Day With Reference to this holds Centuries: Thus the good God, if to me he denies Long outward Life, still cheers me on my Way By doubling that within thro' my own Faculties! THE PEN. With this, as little as it seems, can one Work Wonders! build up Cities, plough the Waste, Alter Costumes and Laws, and change the Taste Of Nations, set up Thrones and pluck them down! What Priviledge then claims it as its own? Or what strange Subjects 'neath its Sway are placed, That thus with a few Strokes can be effaced Things grey as Time, familiar as the Sun? Men's Thoughts! these move all! act but on the Thought And Will of Man, and then the Lever by Which mightiest Revolutions have been wrought Is in thy one weak Hand! lost to Man's Eye Perhaps, like God, by few or known or sought, Thou with two Fingers mov'st the World's Machinery! TRUE STRENGTH. How beautiful, to see from Age to Age A blessed Truth enlarging silently Its Sphere of Action: tho' impeded by Error and Prejudice, still with them wage A holy Warfare: and to the blind Rage Of these brute Foes opposing constantly, Not mortal Weapons, useless where the Sky And its invisible Agencies engage To make the Cause to prosper sure, but those By Hands not framed, and wearing not away, Weapons of Light! which with their viewless Blows Smite not alone the palpable Foe of Clay, But pierce the Giant Error's Heart, whence flows All Evil, and destroy the Cause for aye! TO THE OVERGODLY. Who sanctioned thee to sit in Judgment on Thy Fellows, or to draw a Line which is Far stricter than God himself makes? is his First Feeling Vengeance? yet if anyone, Methinks, should feel that, it were he alone Who is all Purity! but even this Makes him of so long Suffering: yea! 't is His Love that fills his Godhead out! let none Then hold his Virtue as a Reason for Severityâfor is not God far more Removed from thee, than thou from the worst Whore Or Sinner? yea! and if thine Eye but saw The Heart as his does, thou wouldst think before Condemning, and of thy Faults, not the Law! And why is God so merciful? because He knows the Object what it is and was: Then do thou too so, and like God's thine Eye Will see godlike, and therefore lovingly! MAN AND NATURE. 1 'T was just such a sweet Eve as this Full fifteen Years ago, The Earth was green, as now it is; In Midjune's leafiest Glow. 2 The Brook that murmurs at my Feet Flows on as in those Days, I am no more a Child, yet it With childlike Joy still plays. 3 Its Source is full as erst of yore, No Failure doth it know, Yet that within my Heart no more Flows as 't was wont to flow. 4 How oft, on this sweet Flowerbank With Twilight shadows dim, I've watched the Boughs that rose and sank At the quick Eddy's Whim. 5 And oft a whole long Summersday I've pass'd in Fairydreams, In Dreams more sweet than boyish Play, Where there is more than seems. 6 Such as belong alone to Youth, Lingerings of Heavenslight: Comminglings with the primal Truth Ere Earth has claimed her Right. 7 For Youth believes in all he sees, And to firm Faith is given To realize what she doth please And bear us back to Heaven. 8 And when the Villagechimes came clear Upon the dewy Air, Oh! what a sweet, sweet Sound to hear For one who knew no Care! 9 Of Nature's Music they formed Part, As blithe as the Bird's Song, As yet not jangled, for my Heart, The Keynote, was not wrong. 10 And ever when they seemed to die Still by the Echo caught They came again misteriously Like Answers to strange Thought. 11 The selfsame Scene's before my Eyes, The same Sound in my Ears, Oh! say then where the Difference lies Since all unchang'd appears. 12 The Dayseye glimmering at my Feet Is still as fresh in Hue, The Woodbine's Perfume smells as sweet As when, like Life, 't was new. 13 Why cannot I stretch forth my Hand And pluck it as of yore, What is there in it that but scann'd It makes my Heart run o'er? 14 The Hour of Beauty's pass'd away, The Flower blooms not for me, A younger Hand may pluck and play And feel what I scarce see. 15 Poor Mortal! Nature changes not, Her Heart beats calm and true, The selfsame Pulse is in her Breast, Say is it so with you? 16 Oh no! oh no! my Heart beats quick And feverish in my Breast, And I am very, very sick, For I can find no Rest. 17 The Bloom from all Life's Fruit is gone, They're rotten at the Core, They drop in Mockery one by one, The Tree will bear no more. 18 Oh Time! bring back on thy swift Wings Of early Youth some Dews, And sprinkle onceagain all Things With their primeval Hues. 19 That but for one brief Moment, but One Moment ere I part, I may behold those Scenes, then shut The Vision in my Heart! TIME. Oh Time, who musest by the Grave and on The Brink of dark Forgetfulness, in whose Unfathomable Depths thou fling'st all those Vain Records which do testify alone Of thy Gifts misapplied, on that Gravestone Why sitt'st thou with thine Hourglass which shows Its few, small Grains, yet measures out all Woes, Cares, Toils, howgreatsoe'er, beneath the Sun: Whose Moments, busy Workmen! forge the Chain Of stern Necessity, that binds as well The bosomcradled Babe thro' Joy and Pain, As the vast Life of Nations: thou couldst tell Strange Secrets of that Grave which must remain Voiceless, and with the Worms forever dwell! WEALTH'S NOTHINGNESS. What tho' ye loll in gilded Halls! e'en these Shall to your sated Eyes seem dull and bare And cheerless as the cobweb'd Walls which are The Prisoner's Limits: Pleasure cannot please Who surfeits on it, in the Lap of Ease Unrest shall pillow ye, and wrinkled Care Sit by ye at the sumptuous Banquet, share Your costly Viands, and that worst disease, Selfweariness, into your Vitals eat! With unbought Pleasures this wide World doth teem For him who still preserves the sacred Heat Of simple Feelings, but in vain ye deem Nature's wise Laws like Man's to bribe and cheat: Her Joys are unbought Boons, and, as is meet, Worth but what they stand for in our Esteem! FOLLY AND WISDOM. Thus may one know the Fool from the wise Man: Give to the former all that Hope can crave, All that between the Cradle and the Grave The everbusy Fancy's Brain can plan, The End will find him such as he began, Unformed within, unchanged in all Things save Grey Hairs and Wrinkles: let the other have Of stern Reality the scantiest Span With Means commensurate, yet therein he Can fashion forth a World of Beauty, make Mere earthly Things subserve Eternity: He in sublime content Want's Bread will break As 't were the Bread of Immortality, Yea! Faith to that can change it for his Sake! CHARITY. There are two Kinds of Charity: the one Less Child of Tenderness than Vanity, Stretching its Hand out ostentatiously In the World's Eye, lest it should not be known Or duly trumpeted: less with its own Still, inward Approbation pleased than by Vain Tokens waiting on it outwardly; The other is of divine Birth, alone Seeking the Object's Good not its own Praise: Yea! caring not tho' its best motives be Unknown or misinterpreted, for he Whose Act rewards itself already has All that he sought, Bliss perfect inwardly, Profaned and lessened by the vulgar Gaze! TO THE ANTINOUS IN THE FLORENCE FINEARTSGALLERY, AN ODE. 1 What look'st thou at, Antinous? for sure On Vacancy such Gaze was never bent: To what far Regions calm and bright, and pure From Life's vain Turmoil, is thy Spirit sent Abroad on fancywing'd Discovery? Gazing and gÃ¡zing 'till the Void grows filled, And from the Womb of Nothing there arise A world of Beauty: 'till the sensual Eye, In which the Soul its Essence has instilled, Th' Invisible unconsciously descries! 2 Oh breathing Marble, on whose placid Brow, With soft Locks blown as by the Summerair And bended Head, the restless Years leave no Remembered Trace, and from whose Lips so fair Time cannot banish for a Moment's Space The quiet Smile, there mantling like the Bloom Upon the untouched Floweret of the Spring, To us, still toiling in Life's troublous Race, 'Tis sweet to see thee, happy one, on whom The passing Hour throws no dark Shade from its Wing! 3 Oh might those Lips but find a Voice to speak What 'tis thine Eye looks on: methinks e'en now A Whisper on mine inner Ear doth break, But straight it fades in mistic Echos low Thro' the unfathomable Soul, there lost Amid those Depths which with Eternity Communicate, tho' how we know not: strange! Upon the mighty Ocean we are tost, And still the Current sweeps unknowingly Our Bark beyond e'en Fancy's widest Range 4 Where Shore and Polestar are no longer seen! And thou, pure Marble! with thy Form so chaste, Art likest some bright vision which has been Revealed unto us in our sleep, embraced But for a moment and then lost again In its own Glory, like an Angelsform That melts away into the Ether blue From whence it broke upon us: but in vain The Film falls from our Fyes, soon Cloud and Storm Sweep the brief Glimpse of Ether from our View! 5 Gaze on, gaze on, thricehappy one, gaze on That brighter world which to thy favored Eyes Is opened up: that world which we alone By Faith and calm Content can realize, Whose Magiccircle, small as it may seem To those who stand without, to him inside Is rich and ample asâEternity! At Times as if I stepp'd into thy Dream Visions of Bliss float up 'till then denied, And Death seems but a Name and Time mere Jugglery! 6 Then do I consciously posses my whole, My undivided self, and feel I live In Oneness with the universal Soul Of human Being: I no longer strive To comprehend the mistic Nature by Which thou, fair Marbleform, art haunted as By some bright Spirit's Presenceâ I am one With it, it is in me e'en as in thy Still Life, felt when the Soul awaken'd has Look'd thro' itself, those Depths so little known, 7 E'en to ourselves, to all save God's clear Eye Whose calm Glance there at Times meets ours! and he Who should possess his Soul, who consciously Could grasp it in its Height and Depth would be Like unto God! yea, he might look before And after thro 'the Life of Things! but who Can take the measure of his Soul? who feels Not self too vast for self? for still the more We search the more we grope and so must do, 'Tis in Eternity, on whose dark Brink Thought reels! 8 For tell me is not Soul Eternity? Was it not once ere this frail Flesh was made To shackle it, when this in Dust shall be Will it not be with its first Form arrayed Again as heretofore? who then, I say, Shall compass that of which he neither knows The End nor the Beginning? then tho' we Should search and search until our Heads grow gray, Sense doth impassable Barriers oppose, And what Soul is we forefeel mistily! For the Soul's secret is God's too, he is Our Soul, and in its Boundlessness 't is his: When most we lose ourselves in it, then most 'Tis his, in which all others must be lost! ON THE TRUE SOURCES OF BEING. How few Life's Elements have learnt to blend In their real Harmony; how few possess The true Accord, the Keynote, without which The Music still must sleep, as if't were not. Coarseminded, skillless Players we rush o'er The mystic keys, wherein the deep Spell lies So simple yet so deep, and by a Stress Of meaningless, accumulated Notes Crowded for Eareffect and vain Display Of brute, mechanic knowledge, we call forth A Crash of illdistinguished Notes, which take The Sense by Storm, yet reach not to the Heart. For Power lies not in Force or Number, but In Fitness and Simplicity, and he, The one true Artist, he whose outward Ear Takes Rule and Measure from within, knows that The calm, deep Music of Humanity, Of Heart and Soul, its Power te exalt, Refine, and soothe, lies far below this Crash Of earoffending, surfacelying Noise, In a few simple but soulthrilling Notes, A few selfblent Accords, which but just touched Start into Harmonyâbut these the Hand, The soulimpellÃ«d Touch alone can wake; And this sweet Music of the Soul, which dwells Within it, as within the seaborn Shell Echos and mighty Murmurings, which speak Of the allchangeless Ocean, tho' that Shell Be long sourcesevered, dwelling haply where The Name of Ocean is an idle Word, Calling up no high Thoughts of Beauty, Might, And everduring Majesty, so in The Soul, tho' to the inward Ear alone, Like Music dwells, when in a blessed Mood Our Faculties grow ample and serene; Mysterious Echos from another World, Sounds as of mighty Waters heard afar, Of that same Springheadocean whence all Powers And Faculties of Spirit flow, return And tend; but this sweet Music to the World's Dull, drowsy Ear is all too pure and deep; As little felt as the Sphereharmony Of yon bright Stars, when in their mystic Rounds Their multifarious orbs are rolled along As noiselessly as Thoughts thro' God's own Mind, Whose Thoughts are Worlds and Sunsâ âWith the Ellwand Of weekday Forms and Customs would the World Measure celestial Things, and thus the Mind Not modelled to its Fashion, must submit To be a Scorn and Jest to those who toil Along the dusty Highway which the Feet Of servile Generations have marked out; Or if it dare to leave this beaten Track, The Smoke and Stir of Mammon, for the calm And lovely Paths of Nature, the green Fields, The musicflowing Streams, and sunny Hills That spread on either Hand, and mould itself By the sweet Access of all natural Forms, And Shapes and Sounds, unto a truer Life, It is a crying Sin, and not forgot When, in its Pharasaic Mood, the World Preaches its loud Damnation against those Who dare to think and act as natural Beings! Yea! a Man's Conduct may be allcondemned When by the narrow and Halfwisdom of The World 'tis measured: his best Actions too Will seem alldisproportioned and distort When laid upon the Procrustean Bed Of Prejudice, and lopp'd of their most fair And grand Proportions, until thus reduced To Custom's wretched Compass, or stretched out In uncouth Monstershapes to suit his false Distorted Standard, but there is an hight- Er, fuller Wisdom than that of the World, An ampler Scope: a System of more full, More catholic and sublime Sympathies, Higher Relations, which complete the Links Of Being from the smallest Worm that crawls, Yea! up to God's own Throne: and judged by these His Actions will be haply found in true And godlike Keeping with the wider Scope And ampler Movement of this higher Sphere, This nobler System: with the mighty Whole Of that same Nature which we comprehend Only by Breaks and Snatches 'till we are Alive in Soul: 'till we be truly grown Parts of that mighty Whole, and sympathize Like healthy Members with the Universe! Here, in this World, its narrow Wisdom's Reach We oft o'erstep when we but venture o'er The Boundmark of its Forms and Prejudices: And yet it is precisely then we step Abroad into the glorious Realm of Truth, Of God, of Nature, and of Liberty: 'Tis then first we possess that which we have Of Valuablest, Inalienablest, Ourselves! for then we are all that we have, For what we are not cannot be called ours; In our ownselves possessing our own Souls, And living in our God, a Part of him, An Emanation from him, e'en as Light Is of the Sun! quickened, and in our Turn Quickening these fleeting Forms of mortal Life: 'Tis then that we commence the Life of Soul, Alive in the true Sense, to all of Grand, Of Beautiful in Nature, Man and Art; Rays which tho' falling in a thousand Modes On an Infinitude of diverse Forms With Rainbowlight, yet flow from one sole Source, Th' enduring True and Good! nor do we feel These Beauties with a Heart, that watchlike, beats Sixty Pulsations in a Moment's Space, Under the dead, mechanic Forms and Modes Of an Existence modelled upon Rule Like a Machine, but with a holy Gush Of allpervading Love, which clasps all Forms Of mortal Being, and which makes our Heart A Pulse harmonious in Nature's vast And allembracing Bosom, yea! in God's! MODERATION. Seek nought with Overtoilâelse thou wilt by The Search thereafter lose more than the Gain The finding of it bringsâand if with Pain And Fretting thou keep'st what thou hast, then thy Wealth itself grows a Source of Misery; Much with much care is nothingâ'tis the Bane Of Overwealth, itself, itself makes vain, Then seek it not: a few Things perfectly Enjoyed contribute more to Happiness Than many, which must be enjoyed far less, Because so many! Things but one by one Can be enjoyed, and he who has alone Few objects of Affection, just for this Enjoys them more, because he long has known How their Existence is bound up with his, For he has made each to himself that which it is! SMALL THINGS. 1. Neglect not small Things for the Sake of those Which thou call'st Â«Great:Â» it is our Feelings by Which their Worth must be measured; and if thy Delight be full, if Rapture thro' thee flows At sight of the least Child, or Flower that grows By the wayside, if Love into thine Eye Pushes the Tear of trembling Ecstacy, What matters it to what thy full Heart owes Its Bliss, howsmallsoe'er it be, if thine Own Feelings be thus perfect and divine? The Goblet must receive according to Its Capability, and if the Wine Of Joy o'erflow, is it not lost to you? What thy own Breast contains, that is thy true, Thy only Wealthâand if the least Thing can Make thee feel all that is implied in Man, Then thou must feel Â«the Godlike,Â» and then what Is there which in that Feeling thou hast not? Now, to the End that each least Thing may give This Fullness of all Beauty, learn to live As ever in God's Presence, and too see Him in all Things, then e'en the least to thee Will bring the Feeling of the Boundless; yea! The smallest Grain upon the Seashore may Awake that Feeling, full and vast as the Illimitable Ocean itself; be Spirit, and then thou wilt feel boundless too, Like him from whom thy Soul its Being drew! 2. In seeking one great Pleasure pass not by The manythousand lesser ones, which, as The Flowers that we by the wayside pass, Make Life delightful, and which certainly Togetherreckoned far outbalance thy Great Joy, which troubles thee, because it was Hoped for too anxiously, and thus it has, By fretting, lessened thy Serenity Of Soul, without which no great Pleasures can Be feltâ no godlike pleasuresâ for in Man The Godlikeâ God! is felt alone when he Is stillest, for th' Unspeakable can be Known only by its Calm, and e'en the Deep Thunders not forth God's name so grandly thro' The Tempest, as when all his Billows sleep, (Like many Feelings lost in one, more true And sublime) and thus blended form one whole, Still, godlike still, an Emblem of God's Soul! While in the boundless Glass the Maker's Form Is mirrored, disappearing with the Storm! How much more then Man's soul, where all that is Most godlike is most still, when most like his! 3. And if now thy Serenity be gone, Thy Power of Joy is lessenedâbut when one By one thou find'st Life's Pleasures by the Way, Each just sufficient for the passing Day, And consequently for thy whole Life too, For if thou liv'st each Day what more can you Do or desire? â And each plucked as it blows, Gently not hastily, since e'en the Rose Has Thorns, and Eagerseeking mars its own Enjoyment, neither culled and straightway thrown Aside, like little children grasping all They see, and letting many Flowers fall Thus unenjoyed, nay, marring by the Fret Felt at their Loss the sweets remaining yet; Thro' the superfluous destroying still The Needful, and thus turning Good to Ill; As if the Flowers of Life were scattered not By the whole way, but crowded in one spot: As if our Joys were not like Flowers, which When freshest yield the scent most full and rich, And which laid by, or out of season sought, Fade or are found not, leaving us thus naught But Disappointmentâ for Joys cannot be By Calculation multiplied, Forethought And Toil and Seeking: they must spring up free, Like the Wildflowers, 'tis the present Sun And Rain from which their Hues and Scents are won, So from the present Feelings likewise is Produced the passing moment's fresh, clear Bliss, No vapid repetition, but as strong, True, and spontaneous as the Bird's blithe Song: And as each moment its own Feelings brings, So from its Soil a new, fresh Pleasure springs, That is if thou hast taken Care to sow The Seeds, for even Oaks from Acorns grow, So great Joys out of Little: so much lies In small Things, and therefore to Wisdom's Eyes Nought, nought, seems small: for greatest Things still by Degrees become so: then mark well thisâthy Great Joy must thro' the lesser ones be so, They must have first prepared thy mind to know And feel it, bat if thy Heart has not been Prepared, canst thou receive it? can the green Stalk bear the fullripe Corn or does the Rose Yet in the Bud possess the Scent it throws Forth when fullblown, and which it owes unto So many little Things, to Sunbeams, Dew- Drops, Airbreaths, Raindrops, all? now hast thou lived Wisely and calmly, then wilt thou have hived From all these Moments and these Hours, which Seem separately so, so small, a rich Inheritanceâa greater joy by far Than that you sought, yea! one in which all are Summed up: which no one Joy howgreatsoe'er Could give, an Habit of real Joy, which ne'er Can be acquired save by littles, by What each Day brings unto the hive, with thy Own Feelings filled: a greater Power and Capacity of Joy, like the Seasand Made up of million Parts, and yet one Whole, The general Frame and Temper of the Soul Pervading each least Feeling, Act and Thought, Whcih thus with an whole Life's long Bliss is fraught, For all its Moments cause that Frame of Mind, And all its sepurate Joys you therein find Summed up: without these it could never be: Thus thy whole Life's long Bliss is felt by thee In each full, pregnant Moment, each is as A fullblown Rose, where all it ever was, From the first Seedleaf to the blushing Flower, Is summed up and enjoyedâthus by this Power Wilt thou find Joy where thou hadst never sought, Where else none would have been: for thou hast taught And schooled thy Heart, which will not fail thee, no, When all else does; and if thy Pleasures flow From thence, what matters it if thou find'st none Without? Bliss at the Heart is all in one. And who can rob thee of thy Bliss, when thou Thyself art it? thou only knowÃ«st how! ON THE NEEDFUL. Be always occupied: have something to Keep Mind and Heart awakeâand whatsoe'er Thou turn'st thy Spirit to, do so with clear, Full Consciousnessâfor tho' it seems to you Beneath thy Notice, yet if thou canst thro It feel thy whole Self, then no wider Sphere An Empire's Cares could offer theeâ 'tis here Men err so muchâ great Occupations do Net necessarily enlarge the Mind And Heartâ but an enlargÃ«d Heart will find Greatness in all Things, even in the least, And most, where most it should, in its own Breast! Strive then for thisâ then wilt thou be resigned In every Occupation; nay! the best Will grow out of the worst; for having naught Beside, thou wilt possess thyself! in thy Own Heart wilt seek for thy own Feelings, by No false Impressions weakened, but thus brought Forth from the Virginsoil unfailingly; And what Want can our Feelings not supply? Naught needful is, save as we think it so: And most superfluous Things more needful grow, By foolish Thinking, than the needfullestâ The worst Ill; since the truly Needful we Should always, deeply, feel, since it must be Essential to Man's Being here, nor can He without it be even really Man; And what now is most needful to him? the Sentiment of the Godlike: this same free And sublime Selfdependence which the poor- Est may possess the most; but which is sure To perish, when superfluous Things have grown Needfulâ when substituted for our own Best Feelings, in which most the Godlike shows Itself, as in its Perfume does the Rose; And when these are no more a real Want, then We lose the Godlike, and are no more Men, We live not by the Heart within our Breast! According on what our Affections rest Is all our Happinessâ then fix them on The Easilyattainable alone, The True and the Enduringâand what is So much so as that which thou ne'er canst miss, Wilt thou but think soâ the Godlike in thine Own Heart and Feelingsâ make but these divine, Then will the highest Things be easiest Attained: the deepest, comprehensiblest! For thou feel'st God! this Feeling in thy Soul Is the true Keynote of this lovely Whole, For God is at the Bottom of all Things, The Burthen of the Hymn the wide World sings The least, least Flower tells of him, as well As of the Ocean does the murmuring Shell! Then feel him, and thou know'st what all Things feel; To feel him always in Man's highest Weal! ON THE WELLDOERS OF MANKIND. Who plucked the Laurel for the sublime Brow Of Genius, or wherefore did he chuse That Plant? because 'neath its unwithering Hues There lurks a deadly Poison too, which no, No Medicine can heal? it must be so! In it that Poison Nature did infuse, Foreseeing what would someday be its Use, The bitter Moral of his Tale to show! Like Christ, th' Apostles of Humanity Must suffer for Mankind; too strong, too deep, The Spirit in them to be lulled asleep! They have their Tabors too, their Agony, And Drops of Blood, not common Tears, they weep! Their sole Reward, their bitter and severe Delight, which like their Pains the vulgar Mind As little can conceive as it could bear; Their sole Reward, to be transfigured by The inward Light, by that sublimed, refined! An Emanation of, nay, the most High Himself in them, who looks with his own Eye From them, in his own Glory steeps their Pain And Grief, in them transfigured once again! DEATH. Oh Death! no Poet ever called on thee For Inspiration, or thy Cypressbough Plucked in the Laurel's stead, to grace his brow; Yet thine is of the two the best, 'tis free From Poison: and those who have learnt to see Aright will tell thee also, there is no, No Place where the true Evergreen will grow Or can be gathered surer than on the Sad Grave! Truth's Ear is in the inmost Heart, And the loud Voices of the World are there Unheard: nor Overjoy nor blank Despair To it true Revelations can impart; But thou, oh Death, when softened thy first Smart, Canst whisper things unutterably fair! THE POET. Praise to the Poet! 'tis no vulgar Throne, Pillared on Crime and Wealth and idle State, Which he aspires to, built up on Hate, By Violence and Fraud maintained alone; His is a nobler Sceptre, which those own The readiest, who feel it most: the Weight Of brute Oppression can at best create A forced obedience, but him we crown With Hands of busy and officious Love, And if he binds us with his Chains, these are Our best affections, in which we still move As free as thro' the Ether some bright Star, Fulfilling its high Mission there above In Limits which assist its course, not bar Or hinder; he, he rules but o'er the Heart, By what is noblest, o'er the noblest Part; Therefore secure from mad Revolt or War! THE DRYAD'S CURSE. 1. Spurn not their Blessing, ye on whom their Curse Has not yet fallen! 'tis a barren Heart, A Blight of Ear and Eye; oh! what is worse Than seeing not to see, to take no Part In Nature's Jubilee, or want that Art, That blessed Art, which from Earth's meanest Flower Can glean a joyous Thought, and thus impart Wisdom with Bliss unto each passing Hour! For Wisdom's half a Fool whose sad Brows always lower! 2. The bitterest Curse of all it is to have A barren Heart, a Heart to Nature dead, This is to live within a living grave: The Prisoner is more blest, for he can tread In fancied Freedom, in his damp Walls' stead Call up the bright green Fields; but he who lies Under the Dryadscurse, he sees Earth spread In Glory round him yet he has no Eyes, It is not his! tho' on the very Spot, He has it less, far less than those who see it not! 3. Never was Poet, worthy of the name, Who loved not these airbeings, and again Was loved by them: while others see but tame And common objects, he beholds the Train Of Oreads glide like Shadows: from the Main He sees old Triton lift his foamgirt Head; He too has worshipped, worshipped not in vain, The Universal Pan, and ate the Bread, Love's true Communionbread, o'er Earth's wide Table spread! THE DAYSEYE. 1 Look on this Dayseye, you who ask Why o'er it I thus bend, To tell thee why were harder Task Than some well comprehend. 2 'Tis not by Words that I can say Why it thus moves me so, Oh thou must find some other Way Or nothing wilt thou know. 3 E'en Poesy's own Tongue could tell Scarce half of what I feel, Time o'er the Rest has rung his Knell, And set his mystic Seal! 4 If to thine Eye it bring the Tear, A quick Beat to thy Heart, A Freshness unto what was sere, Then answer'd straight thou art. 5 It is a Tale of bygone Days, A Spirit haunts that Flower, 'Round its meek Head a Glory plays Not of the passing Hour! 6 Then let it be an Emblem still Of all that's pure and good, A quiet Heart, a harmless Will, Of Childhood's blessÃ«d Mood! 7 Still may'st thou pluck it when the Hour Of Life's Farewell is nigh, Recalling that bless'd Mood once more To fit thee for the Sky! THE RAINBOW. Might it not seem as tho' Heaven's Bosom were Poured forth in Beauty and in Glory o'er The still stormshrouded Earth? a dazzling Shower Of varied Hues which in their Radiance bear Promise of Peace: 'mid the blue Rents of Air The Raindrops glisten, soft as Tears that flow From Mercy's Angeleyes, when fervent Prayer Repentant Sinner offers from belowâ Does not that Rainbow, robed in Glory, seem A Spirit of clestial Shape and Might, Watchful for Good, evoked from Heaven's bright But unseen Depths, while, darkling, 'round him teem The Elements of Evil? glorious Bow! That with thy Cloudpath archest o'er the Sky, A Sign set there unto Eternity By a relenting God! be ever so, But Cloud and Sunshine to the Sceptic's Eye, To Faith a Pledge of Triomph over Woe! AN ODE TO THE STATUE OF THE PRIESTESS IN THE FLORENCE SCULPTURECOLLECTION. 1 Fair Daughter of Antiquity, chaste Bride Of the pure Altar and the God to whom Thou offeredst up thy Heart, and mad'st the Pride Of Youth, its Pleasures and its fleeting Bloom, A holy Sacrifice to win thee that Diviner Love which passes not away: By high Selfconquest fit a God to wed: Methinks I see thee glide along and at The Altar stand as in the bygone Day, With Step which on the Earth scarce seems to tread! 2 Methinks I see thy long, fair Robes of White Floating upon the Marble at thy Feet In Folds as Summercloudlets soft: thy right Hand laid upon thy Breast in Posture sweet Of holy Meditation, veil'd there by The gauzelike Vest which gives half to our View The Swelling of the fair, chaste Limbs below, And in thy Left, for sacred Ministry, The Censer wherewith on the Flame to strew The Perfumes: but mere emblematic Show 3 Is all this now! in his grand Epic Time Employs thee as a Metaphor, he makes Fact Fancy, and where Poets hint by Rhime The Thing itself from real Life boldly takes! How soft thy Motion! as on each fair Limb Th' indwelling Soul impressed its own serene And! deep Composure, from all Passion free Which might the Maker's Image cloud or dim: How chaste, how still, how holy is thy Mien! The Temple's and the Altar's Sanctity 4 Still cling around, like Heaven's Atmosphere, And hallow thee, as tho' an Angel were Descended from his Ether calm and clear With blessÃ«d Tidings missionedâand thy Hair, Thy golden Hair, divided on thy Brow, Whence breathes a nameless Charm of Modesty As from thy whole sweet Figure, is bound round With the white Raiment which in Folds doth flow Adown thy Shoulders, and thy fair Feet by The Sandal girt glide on without a Sound! 5 Fairantique Maid! could those Lips speak they would Give Oracles the Delphic Shrine ne'er heard, Time's Mouthpiece tho' by so few understood! Bright Forms float past me and thy Lips seem stirr'd. Daughter of Sophocles, Antigone! Child of his Spirit, born as if to right Sophocles, when cited by his thankless Son as no longer mindsound, triumphantly cleared himself by reading the just then written Tragedy of Ãdipus Colonos. His injured Name, say didst thou not look so, Move so beside thine agÃ«d Sire when he Borrowed from thy sweet Eyes their holy Light To cheer and lead him onward in his Woe? 6 Where art thou, Maiden with the fair, pale Brow? Chaste Helen of the Soul! thou spotless Bride Of daring Fancy, who would bring below Some Shape of Ether with him to reside In Love like that which sanctifies the Sky. Bright Phantom, art thou dead, or didst thou e'er Walk on this Earth so flat, so dull, and cold? Methinks that Form was never made to die, Methinks that Beauty Time nor Grief could sere, In Substance glorified it grew not old! 7 Somewhere thou dwell'st in Blessedness: in some One of those far Hesperian Isles, of which Thy Poets dream'd nor vainly, thou an Home Hast found, and there unchang'd thou liv'st on rich In calm and serene Joys: tho' long since where Thou erst didst dwell thy Name be quite effaced, The Rose with its old Perfume still is sweet: But where is now thy Temple once so fair, With its longvista'd Columns, and the chaste, Pure Marble echoing to thy sandal'd Feet? 8 Where is thine Altar? Echo answers, where? Earth keeps no Vestige of them: like a Dream They've pass'd away, nor on the Midnightair Or Forest dim, nor yet by haunted Stream Doth gray Tradition e'er pronounce that Name: Her Lip is silent, where then can I find Even a mossy Stone with Letters by Time's slow Touch worn and lost for aye to Fame? But still that nobler Ternple of thy Mind Stands perfect in its own Eternity! THE MISER'S VISION. A Miser waking from a blissfull Dream, By Hermes sent, in which his gloating Eyes Beheld a Diamondheart of wondrous Size, Whence Jewels dropped unceasing, of such Gleam That each a Monarch's Ransom well might seem, Embraced his own Wife in the first Surprize, But feeling her Heart beat, and not the Prize, Which thus he hoped to grasp, exclaimed, I deem Â«'Tis nothing but my Wife!Â» and then again He fell asleep: thus troubled by the Pain Of Disappointment, Hermes once more rose Before him, and thus spake in Anger,Â» those Bright Jewels still must be to thee a vain And empty Dream, so long as thou canst not Distinguish the real Blessings of thy Lot! When thou awak'st thy Wife is like that Dream, Nought unto thee, therefore in Sleep I show Thee her true Value: now, if thou wouldst gain The Dream which so divine to thee did seem, Wouldst make it real, thou must make thy wife so, By loving her: then from her Heart will flow Those divine Jewels which on thee did gleam: Yea, tentimes more divine! thy Gold will be When thou awakÃ«st in Eternity Like the Wealth of that Dream: will leave thy Heart Empty and vile, for it is not a Part Of that or thee: but these can ne'er be lost, They are thy Heart, thyself, and thou art most Thyself when having most of these! and he Who judges, asks not of thy Gold, but thee, For that is perishable, but thou art Immortal, with th' Immortal's Eyes then see, And chuse the Treasures of Eternity!Â» So saying, Hermes spread his Wings, and left The Miser, of his fancied Wealth bereft, But with a far, far godlier to supply Its Place, a Heart reclaimed to Feelings high! GOD IN THE WORLD. 'Tis from the Complex of Man's History The Outline of God's Form grows strong and clear, The mighty Shadow cast on all Things here, From the far Depths of yon' untroubled Sky! The Viewing of the whole Machinery First shows its End and Working: Parts appear Oft disproportioned 'till brought into near Relation, by the Power of an Eye That sees the Whole as One! then, as in a Gigantic Glass, the Form of God we may Behold, in its sublime Proportions shown: There are two Mirrors, this World, and our own Deep Souls, but God's Reflection thence alone Is cast on this, when it is clear as Day: Then keep it so, that ever on thy Way The Shadow of his Presence may be thrown, That thou mayst walk therein and never stray, But feel it still, like thy own Shadow, near, And ever stronger, as within more clear The Light, like that too: never lost to thee, 'Till in the Grave at length it disappear, When thou wilt no more in his Shadow be, But in his Presence, and himself wilt see! THE GODLIKE. The World rewards thee after its own Kind With that which it sets Store by, but thereon When thou wouldst lean, lo! like a Breath 'tis gone! But God rewards thee still thro' thy own Mind, Thy Heart and Feelings: what way could he find, But this, to make thy Spirit feel his Own? Then keep this Medium everfree, that none But godlike Things may thy Affections bind, Sublimed by such Communion: if thou Thus keep'st thy Mind and Feelings godlike, how Can aught that this World offers seem to thee A fit Reward for what thou dost? if now The Godlike be of God, then it must be Repayed by being so, for so is he. And where then wouldst thou seek the Godlike save In thy own Heart?âand this the Poorest have! A Godlike Recompense for Godlike Deeds It then in all Men's Reach: and he who needs Another Recompense besides, has done Naught Godlike, sought the Servant's Hire alone! And therefore in Return for what he gave, Receives not Feeling's boundless Recompense, But the mere strict Amount, in Pounds and Pence! BIRTHDAYBELLS. 1. Ring out, ye Bells! ring out your hasty Glee, And leave the vengeful Grave his Rest: these Bones, Here mouldering, give the Lie unto your Tones Of Merriment, and seem to say that ye Indulge in most untimely Revelry: Alas! how soon the joyous Heart atones For its least Trespass! Sorrow but postpones The Stroke that it the more secure may be: He gives the Tendrils Time to knit, then breaks All the Heartstrings in plucking them away! Oh wait awhile, the envious Power takes Stern Compensation: at some future Day He makes the Balance even and upshakes The bitter Dregs that yet untasted lay! 2. And thou, too happy one, so young in Years, So beautiful in present Joy and Hope Of that to be, within the Rainbowscope Of Fancy's Vision canst thou see no Tears, No Worm within the Flower of Bliss that sears It in its Prime, when it begins to ope Its sweetest Leaves? but thou wilt not yet grope For these same bitter Truths amid the Bier's Dustcrumbling Records, yet it must be so! As thro' the Tombstones thy young Feet did pass They were to thee no Metaphors of Woe, Yet might each Marble serve as a clear Glass To teach thee Time's stern Lineaments to know, How different what shall be and what was! 3. And thou within thy Cradle, Babe, whose Eye Is opening softly upon this fair Earth And all its Wonders, henceforth from thy Birth To be thy Dwellingplace, where thou must ply Thy sublime Mission: Star, that in the Sky, Whose bright Horizon Prophets saw from here, Hast set, and in this dimmer Atmosphere Rerisen: tho' unconscious when or by What Means the wondrous Change was wrought for thee, Yet from afar with divine Light still fed! Thou that like these young Flowers here might'st be Regarded as Earth's Child, whose Lap is spread For thy Reception, yet more old than she, Tho' Years by thousands sanctify her Head! 4. Thy tiny Cradle is a world too wide Even for Fancy, whose unresting wings In vain would soar to that far Source whence springs Thy Being's Fount: while seated by thy side, In wild Conjectures lost, she strives to hide Her Ignorance of unrecorded Things By painting all her wild Imaginings On the dim Future's Canvass: tho' one Stride Takes her as far beyond all Reach of Thought As a Babe's into Ocean; in her Ear A Marriagebell is ringing blithe and clear, Whose Sound from distant Days thus far is brought, Ere yet the Rope be wove, the Hand be taught To pull it, or the unborn Bride appear! Alas! with far, far other Accents fraught Its Summon sad Reality may hear! 5. Behold the little heir of Life, whose Eye Converses with the Forms of Beauty spread Around him, like one risen from the Dead: For Birth is Death to Immortality, And Death is nothing but Renewal by Which we grow as before, ere Soul had wed With Body, wondrous Union! see him led In either Hand by Hope and Joy, who try Which shall possess his Heart the most, and lay The Map of all Life's Pleasures at his Feet, And bid him chuse: alas! whichever way He takes, all lead in one Direction, meet In Sorrow and the Grave! nor will for aye These joyous Guides his Company entreat! 6. But yet a little while, a few Steps made On Life's rough Path, and he shall no more be The same, but chang'd both in-and outwardly: The Roses from his blooming Cheek will fade, For in his Heart Unrest her Home has made, Now quickening, now checking cruelly The tortured Pulse, and he must live to see His household Bosoms 'neath the chill Earth layd; These Wounds will heal, Time scars them o'er, yet some New Grief with its rude Fingers still will come To rip them up again, he weaves fresh Ties Around his Heart, and in another Home Sits by another Hearth, and in glad Eyes Revives the Thoughts of early Histories! 7. Alas! there is no Armour against Fate! Tho', like Achilles, proof from Top to Toe, One Part's still bare unto the Dart of woe, And that the vitalest! the more our State Spreads in Prosperity the shorter Date It claims, thus wider still the Circles grow When nearest to their End: the Heart has no, No Armour! nay, on its ownself must sate Its Anguish, with its own Blood quench the Thirst, The Fever, that consumes it! hark! he hears A Deathbell sounding aweful, like the first Forerunner of the coming Time of Tears! One Link of Love Time's Hand intwain hath burst, While with still Industry the rest he wears! 8. Indifference arms, but that is Death, Death too At Heart, Death in the vitalest! tho' he In Wife and Child be blest, nor live to see The Frostwind on his Path these Blossoms strew, Yet must he pay the Forfeit, still pass thro' The fiery Ordeal prepared unfailingly Here for all Flesh: from his Heartsdepths still the Stern Oracle, to its sad Office true, Keeps prophecying to the Child of Sin That perfect Bliss no Soul on Earth can win; However Prudence weave the Web or make The Tissue firm and compact, Chance therein Will twine some dark Threads, unobserved will break The fairest, or Knots on the smoothest spin! MAN. From the high Mount of Truth look down with me, Upon the dim and distant depths below; What dost thou hear? a far off shriek of woe, A sound of strife and hatred? dost thou see Where the blind sons of this vain Century Their moleheaps pile and with earthbended brow, Intent upon their grovelling Labours, grow Unto the shape of Beasts: rather than be As these, whom God has made for holier things, 'Twere better not to be: to cast away The spirit's birthright thus, to fold the wings Of thoughts celestial, or make the ray Of reason serve to that which this Earth brings And takes alone, this is to be of Clay! THE ONE TRUE TEMPLE OF GOD. 1. Enlarge thy Thoughts and thy Perceptions 'till The so grand Scale on which all Things are here Arranged, becomes familiar and clear! 'Till thou canst read in all thy Maker's Will, Intelligibly in the Stars which fill The Heavens and instruct thee to revere, As in the Ten-Commandments, which are mere Abbreviations of that Wisdom, still As ever, graved in Characters of Light, Vast, radiant, on this Temple's Walls so fair, Flashing, from all Directions, on thy Sight; Now traced with million Stars thro' all the Air, And now resplendent on the Brow of Night, With words of living Fire, running bright 'Round the vast Dome, such as revealÃ«d were To him alone who read their Meaning right, Thro' Faith, Alluding to Nebuchednezzar's Feast. whose sole Eye could their Radiance bear! 2. Feel grandly, then wilt thou live grandly! see Not with the Body's but the Spirit's Eyes; Be Spirit, then will all Things round thee rise To spiritual Grandeur, then will be Stamped with the Tokens of Immensity, Not like Man's feeble works built up inchwise; Then will no Church however vast its size Suffice thy Soul: yet it is built for thee Already, the true Temple, it is here, But being too familiar, illknown, And on too vast a Scale, 'till thy Thoughts bear More due Proportion to it; when thine own Perceptions shall be raised, thou wilt see clear What now to sensual sight is dimly shown! 3. Live in it then! and feel that it is so! Live worthy of it! think that always thou Art in the Temple of the Lord, and how, How sinful it must be to think or do The least Illthing, or but of Ill to know, Thus in his very Presence; think that now, Nay, at all Moments, thy great Father's Brow Is bent on thee, his Child, to watch thee! oh, Give Ear unto the mighty Preacher, who Unseen himself is seen in all Things here, Whose Wisdom and whose Love, in Language true, Each smallest Thing recounts, forgetful ne'er Of him from whom its Being it first drew; And if this Thought bring to thine Eye a Tear, Oh! let it be a Drop of divine Dew Sent to requicken what in thee was sere, And all the Freshness of thy Heart renew! Wipe it not from thine Eye, for thou mayst thro' It see the world in its real Sense appear, This sentiment alone is perfect Bliss, For then thou feel'st, in thee and it, what is; Thou seest it with God's Eyes, that is to say, Not in its quick Successions of Decay, But in its during Life, that is in His! LOVE. O holy Love! thy feet do rest alone On this dull, sinworn Earth: with folded wing Thou walkÃ«st here below, until Time bring Thine hour of freedom: yet the Angels own Thee for their Mate, as if already flown Back to the bosom of thy God; a Being Of aspirations vast, thou fain would'st wring Futurity from Fate, and build upon This narrow Earth a Paradise; alas! Tho' here below thou breath'st the selfsame air Which Angels breathe above, thou canst not pass The Rubicon of Fate: still must thou share Life's bitter draught unshrinking, 'till it has Tested and fitted thee for worlds more pure and fair! ON NOT LIVING MERELY IN THE PASSING HOUR. Strive still to feel thy whole self: let no Year, Still less one paltry Day, imprison thee In its scant limits: move at large, and free, Live thou above all Time, thus wilt thou ne'er Be the pale trembling slave of Pain and Fear; Feel thou the Being of a whole Life: be Conscious of all thy Moments, as the Tree Of all its Leaves, and like these when grown sere, Let thy past Joys be moulded into new; Feel thyself the Eternal which thou art, Then with the Eternal's Eyes thou'lt learn to view Calmly the Goods of Earth come or depart; Time robs the Being of a Day, but to Thee he is nought, thro' thy sublimer Art Already of Eternity a Part!â NATURE. Falls not the dew upon the unseen flower Which sweetens o'er the Wild? flows not the stream A solitary voice of praise, and beam Not on the Desert the bright stars in power And beauty, as a sign on high, tho' o'er No rapt and upraised brow they shine? to deem That these are useless or misplaced would seem Not less unwise than impious: before Th' allbounteous Maker let us humbly bow, And with Faith's eye discern the harmony Else viewed amiss: think not that all below Is made for thee, proud Man! the mystery Of Worlds unseen is not for thee, and thou Selfgiantized, art but a link 'twixt Earth and Sky! CHILDREN. How lovely! lo! the Sunbeams 'round the Head Of yon' softsleeping Child are thrown, as'twere An Halo 'round a newborn Angel! dare To think so, and when that bright Wreath is fled Let bold Imagination in its Stead Behold that far diviner Crown still there Of its own Innocence! this let it wear Constantly in thy Sight that thou mayst tread As in an Angel's Presence, ever so Regarding it, nor then wilt thou be wrong: For being treated as such it will grow Such really, yea! to thee will then belong A little Angel; and as one Lark's Song Ushers in all the Spring, so here below Around thee with thy Child all Heaven will throng! OD SELFDENIAL. Live simply, then wilt thou feel grandly too! High Thinking and plain Living are more near Akin than thou believ'st: the last doth bear The former's Impressâgive to all their Due: To Sense that merely which is needful to A sound and pleasurable Being here: Thus will the spiritual man be clear- Ersighted, in his Loves and Hates more true! For Selfdenial has its Joys: more dear, Lasting, and sweet from what they cost us! he Who prunes all needless Wants, concentrates so His Mind on better Things, thus truly free: 'Tis not alone that simple Living be Best for our Weal, tho' that be something: no! It is the loftier Tone of Mind which we Thus gain: the Selfcommand that thence must flow With all its noble Heritage, unfailingly As Water from the Spring! 'till Passions low No longer move us: 'till we come to see Life's outward Goods as worthless, when we know What divine Joys from our own Bosoms grow! Denial, tho' it seem to rob of all The lesser Pleasures which like Manna fall On Life's hard Way, becomes, as on we go, Thro' Love and Habit, sublime Luxury: This Wonder is a Wonder of the Sky! For e'en from Want can Virtue Plenty call, And where naught seems, with Overwealth supply: For Earth's least Joy resign'd pour at our Feet Pleasure's full Horn, Bliss lasting as'tis sweet! Then give, give, give! and still yourselves deny! Give all, yea, even your own Hearts away, And God with his own Godlike Heart will pay Ye back a thousandfold! give all ye have, 'Tis but returned to him who all first gave: Give like thy Father up in Heaven, then All that thou giv'st shall come to thee again Sublimed to thy enlarged Capacity! The mighty Heart of all Mankind in thy One Bosom then shall best: yea! thou shalt see Earth's Beauty, and shalt feel Life's Blessedness With Hearts and Eyes of all thy Fellowmen! And as each Grain, howsmallsoe'er it be, In the vast Bell, enjoyeth not the less The Music of the Whole, so shalt thou do: Of all Mankind enjoy the Happiness, As tho' the mighty Heart beat but for you! For each Part with the Whole when blended true, (Else, grainlike, lost in its own Nothingness) Enjoys the Whole, and yet is itself too! Thus mayst thou press all Nature to thy Heart, The mighty Womanâlike a mortal Wife, One with her, yet a Being still apart, Living in her, yet Life too of her Life! EVENING. The Eveningprayerbell from the Villagetower Steals, like a quiet blessing, on the Air, Dying away to Heav'n: the echos there Sound like responsive voices which the power Of sincere prayer calls from on high: each Flower, Each Grassblade and each Leaf, lies fresh and fair As cradled Hope: HeavÃ«n seems, as it were, Just blending with the Earth: the calm, soft hour Is as a Kiss of Peace, wherewith the Sky Hallows his Bride and fits her for Night's high And holy Commune, when Love's mystic Zone Is bound around all things invisibly, And Nature's myriad Hearts their Chords retone: Eolian harps by Heaven's breath soft blown! WE HAVE ALL WE CAN HAVE IF WE PLEASE. Who thinks that future Gains or Goods will make Him happier than he is, or can be now Tho' living by the Sweat of his own Brow, Is much mistakenâall things from us take Their value: and the coarse Bread, for whose sake We toil, does to that very Labour owe Blessings the Bread of Ease can never know: What is more sweet than Water if it slake Real Thirst? and what can slake so well the real And divine Thirst of Heart, as Feelings pure And simple? the sole Thirst that can endure: In calm Selfconsciousness lies Man's true Weal: And with this thou art neither rich nor poor, But godlike! for 'tis God that thou dost feel! WARTRIUMPHS. 1. Upon the bloodstained Battlefield, when rise On heavenscaling Wing of impious Pride The shouts of Exultation, far and wide, Mingled with deathgroans and the fearful cries Of Hate and Strife, a Curse that never dies, Firstborn of Evildeeds, with giantstride Shadows the Scene, and in its Gloom abide The false hopes that in human miseries And crimes are cradled: and the blood that reeks Up from the profaned Earth shall mingle ne'er With kindlier Elements, nor dewlike bear Blessings to it, but barrenness: it seeks The soil from whence it rose, and withers there: And the fierce Triomphshouts, the dread Deathshrieks, 2. With which man o'er his fellowman, like Beast Of prey o'er Beast of prey, exults, the Air On its indignant wing will never bear: Nature disclaims them, from her holy rest Shuddering she wakes, and Echos wild attest Her deep dismay: but from the Days which are As yet unborn, while Vengeance frowns afar, The Angel of eternal wrath shall wrest The scourge of Fate, and gathering on his wing Past Elements of Guilt, the reeking gore Which moistens not the Earth, the Gloom shall fling Of his dark Presence on Crime's Pomp and o'er His pride shall rain down Blood: thus Time doth bring A Sequel to the longforgotten deeds of yore! ON WELLDOING. Who thinks that with Gold only he can do Real Good is half a Foolâalas! what would Then be the Lot of all the Poor: the good And suffering Spirits thus left here unto The tender Mercies of the Rich?âthe true Welldoers are not those who really should Do most for their poor Brothers, and who could, If God had planned this fair World so that thro' Wealth only its chief Blessings must be won; The Poor are the Welldoers, they give Aid Unto each other, and without Parade, Nor make an Insult of the Good that's done. The Beggar gives the Penny he has laid By for himselfâgodlike, as God alone! ON NARROW UNBIBLESANCTIONED PRIESTPREJUDICES. 1. Ye moleeyed Truthmonopolists, who cast The unchristened Babe from out your hallowed Ground, Is there no Restingplace beyond the Bound Of your scant Choice? can in this World so vast, Which God, when all its Tribes before him passed, Bless'd and pronounc'd so good, no Nook be found, But what is hallowed by the vain Lipsound Of your unmeaning Words? ye Fools! the last, Poor, spurned Remains shall rest in Spite of ye, And on the Bosom of its God again The Soul repose, remingled free from Stain With its first Source, as sure and blessedly, As tho' ye had been by with Mockeries vain, Turning God's Broaddaytruth to Mystery! 2. Aye, ye may churchban such as will not pray With your own Forms and Words, as tho' they were Outcasts from Grace, yet are they still as near To God's Salvation, and will find that Way, Better than ye, that leadeth not astray: They have a Temple still, a goodly, fair, And fitting Worshipplace, whose Walls are Air, Whose Roof the Sky itself: wherein by Day And Night are Signs and Tokens that do preach, Better than Lip and Book, unto the Eye And Ear of Faith; a Wisdom within Reach, Yea! of the least Capacity, a Creed So simple that no Comment it can need, The pure Religion of Humanity! This World their Temple is! above their Head No timeworn Roof by Man's frail Hand begun, But the blue Ether like Faith's Banner spread; The Mountains are their Altar, and thereon, The fittest Incense, their own Hearts alone Are poured forth, like the Perfumes round them shed From all Earth's thousand Flowers, of which each, By being stilly what it should, doth preach In silent, yet intelligible Wise, The sublime Moral of Man's Destinies! 3. This is the Temple of the living God! Built with his own Righthand, a Token high To witness for him, clothed in Majesty, As in his Shadow. Winds amid the Wood, These are the Anthem, which, in solemn Mood Blent with far Ocean's Dash, come floating by Upon the Ear, a Voice of Mistery, A Tone that sweeps upon us like a Flood, A Sound of mighty Waters that flow on Afar, and steal upon us like the sweet, Yet solemn Music of Eternity, As heard of Eld ere yet this Race was run; Snatches of a nowbroken Harmony, A Hometunefragment fading alltoofleet! THE SEEMINGBEGGAR. A tattered, wayworn Beggar! verily, To sight it seems so, but how do ye know That gifts of Glory, passing outward Show, May not be hid 'neath Rags and Poverty? He hath asked nought of thee, and passes by Like one who to himself high awe doth owe, A soul which will not for the body bow: And haply he hath more, than you or I, To give of that wherein all worth doth dwell; If we were stripp'd, we might the poorer seem: And God, when he would work a miracle, Even with such as these, whom men esteem The outcasts of society, loves well, Poor, scorned humanity from Insult to redeem! ON SEEING A GRAVESTONE. 1 And is this all that now remains Of Thee, thou good and lovely one, An idle Name, which, with some Pains, We trace upon this mossy Stone? 2 I do remember thee in Days Of which thou wert the Hope and Light; But now this mocking Marble says That thou canst no more bless my Sight! 3 I do not weep: my Breast is too, Too full, to vent itself in Tears; But it doth think such Thoughts of you, As break the Heart of him who bears. 4 Is this thy Grave, thou lovely one! Art thou indeed beneath this Sod? And is it I who stand upon Thy Grave! have Mercy on me, God. 5 Few Feet of Earth do sever me, From all I loved so well and dear: Few Feet! oh Thought of Mockery; So small the Space, and yet so far! 5 Thou canst not hear my Cry of Woe, Or else thy gentle Voice would speak; Tho' Grief be noisy here, below 'Tis Silence which no Tongue can break! 7 Oh Grave, that thou wouldst ope to me, That crumbling Dust to Dust my Heart Might blend with hers, for ever be In Life and Death joined ne'er to part! LIFE. Life is a godlike Thing; as such then bear Thy Part in itâlet nothing mean or base Find in thy Estimate thereof a Place, Then wilt thou live it godlike: yet there are Who blame the Deity, and deem unfair Life's godlike Boon wellusedâthe Thoughts that raise The Spirit to its primal Seatâthe Days Of virtuous Toil for self or others: far Such vain Reproof from me: the Deity Has nought created evilânought for woe. 'Tis true we pluck Sin's bitter Fruitâbut why? The Evil is all Man's both first and now, The Good all God's. He gave the godlike Eye And Heart; if then we do not feel them so, And use them so, the Fault in us must lie! RETRIBUTION. 1. 'Tis not in vain we suffer and we toil! We have our own reward: that inward light Which makes all clear; still 'mid the clouds, blest sight! Faith sees God's mighty arm, stretchd forth to foil Th' Usurper and his hosts: oft the recoil Of his own blow will shatter his frail might! Oft in his impious aims confounding Right And Wrong, snakelike, the Evil will uncoil Its inert folds and crush him! yea! for he Who would, up to a certain point alone, Employ for base selfends its ministry, Still by its wider action is undone: It turns to baffle him; 'twere better play With the Wildtiger, or the Ligtningsray! 2. For who can say, Â«thus far, no farther go,Â» Save God alone? can proud Philosophy, Of all the seeds which in the Future lie, Destined to bear their fruits, say which shall grow, Or which shall not? alas! for Reason, no! His Logic and his Rules are vanity, When he would trace the ways of the Mosthigh; 'Tis given unto Faith alone to know, Or what is better still for mortals here, To doubt not that Â«whatever is, is right,Â» For Faith were not, if she had nought to bear: If needing other guidance than that light, Which coming from her God, alone makes clear The things of God unto the moral sight! TRUE STRENGTH. 1. Who is the happy warrior that may draw The sword of God, and wield it in his name? He who is free from all reproach and blame: Whose ends, like Heaven's own, are pure from Flaw! He from its scabbard may pluck forth, in awe And holy fear, that sword, which, as a flame, Shall wither up his foes: then, whence it came Replace it with all speed, for not in war Doth Wisdom show her true supremacy; From out the Waste of Chaos to create The fabric of pure Strength and Harmony, To base on Virtue an enduring state: This is her nobler task, her office high; War makes the sudden Mighty, Peace th' enduring Great! It is not strength of nerve or sinew may Draw forth God's sword, tho' Hercules should try: Yet to the chosen touch, impelled but by Pure motives, yea! to a weak maid's Essay, As unto Joan of Arc's, 'twill straight give way, And with it they may work their mission high; But should their hearts be touched with vanity, Ambition, or with selfish passion's sway, Its strength departs from it, it works no more Than brittle steel in mortal hand; for ne'er In impure grasp hath it celestial power To lasting things; brute strength of Sinew here Over its like may triumph, but before Invisible Strength it bows in awe and fear! LOVESCENE. 1 She stood beside me, in the Shade, The starry Shade of Heavensblue, Whose Lamps, like nuptial Torches, made By Love eterne, their soft Light threw. 2 She stood beside me, and my Youth With all its Dreams of Harmony Seemed in her Form to grow to Truth, And pass in living Beauty by. 3 As erst thro' my own Heart they passed, Stirring it like Firstlove's long kiss, So on my Sense they shone at last, And turned my Dreams to waking Bliss. 4 She stood beside me like a Flower Bowed neath the dewy Eveningair, In modest Fear, yet conscious Power, I thought she never looked so fair. 5 I took her Hand, it trembled so, And yet no Thought of Wrong was there, It trembled in its own deep Joy, As trembles Love alone and Prayer! 6 I gazed upon her pure, bright Face, Thro' which the Peace of Heaven shone, And Earth seemed as a holy Place, Which Angels themselves might dwell on. 7 I could not speakâmine Eyes where dim, And like a Child, I knew not why, I wept: for when Joy's Cup is brim, The Heart must waste some Drops or die. 8 Waste, do I say! it is not so, Love is no Miser of the Heart: To him there is no future Woe, He has no Self, no meaner Part. 9 Yet were it well that Passion's Breath Ne'er flared to Waste his holy Flame, That burning calmly on 'till Death, It lit us to an higher Aim. 10 An higher Aim! and can there be An higher Aim than thus to love, Nought in the World to feel or see Save our own Bliss and Him above? 11 Of all Thanksgivings that are known, What for the God of Love so fit, As thus to be but Love alone, With his own Self made one by it! 12 Aye, Wisdom comes with Afteryears, The Wisdom of the niggard Brain, But the Heart too a Wisdom bears, An Alchymy ne'er found again. 13 Love becomes Calculation, grows A Miserânot poured from the Heart, Like to the Perfume of the Rose, No more our Being, but a Part. 14 When I look back on that sweet Hour Of Love and holy Tenderness, I feel that all Man's idle Lore Not like the Heart's least Beat can bless. 15 I see again the wellknown Spot, I hear her light Step on the Ground, Long Years have flown since then, yet what Are they? the Echo of a Sound. 16 Methinks I see her as she stood, Wrapped in a Veil of Beauty by The calm Moonlight, which with a Flood Of Glory clothed her to my Eye. 17 She looked an Emanation of That holy Light, and her white Vest, Like a Dovesplumage, seemed to move Above her gentlyheaving Breast: 18 Soft as a Star her blue Eye shone, Yet turned in Bashfulness away, As if she feared to trust upon My prying Glance its telltale Ray. 19 Yet to her Hand a gentle Thrill Th' involuntary Heart conveyed, For' mid his Artifice Love will Forget his Part, the first Time played. 20 Timid her Hand she half drew back, And blushed as tho' 't had been broadday, But true Love is not wont to rack Or fling the Heart it seeks away. 21 She turned in Virginmajesty, In simple Dignity of Mien, Nature alone shone in her Eye, In Gest or Look no Art was seen. 22 Meaning no Wrong, and fearing none, She rayed me with a Smile of Light, Like those which round a Child's Brows run, When Nature prompts unfeigned Delight. 23 Some Underwords she murmured low, Like a still Summerbrook at Eve, Their Sense!âI had no Ear to know: But Love with them a Spell did weave. 24 Modest, but frank and free, she came, Like Eve, and sought my throbbing Breast, And there her Image, aye the same, Lives by that first Embrace imprest. 25 Thus was she wooed, and won, and wed, And Blessings to such Love are sent, A Centralfire, it burns selffed, And brightens on 'till Life be spent. 26 Not the Volcano's fitful Flames, That waste within and scorch around In their first Burst, and when Time tames, Leave for Joy's Seeds fireploughÃ«d Grround. 27 But holy Warmth as of a Sun, Moulding a little World of Joys, Flowers and Plants, whereof not one Bears hidden Thorns, or Fruit that cloys. 28 Blessings be on thee, holy Love! With thee it is indeed to live: For Love is Life! by thee we prove How most we have, when most we give. 29 'Tis Love who earns the Gifts of Faith, 'Tis he who still works Miracles, And in his Might the Spirit hath A Tongue that utters Oracles. 30 He sces the sunny Side alone, And in the Autumnleaf he views No Emblem of Decay, but one Of Beauty in its brightening Hues! 31 He shrinks not back from Grief or Pain, He has no Eyes or Ears for Doubt, Thus in each Loss he finds a Gain, From each Fall rises up more stout. 32 His wiser Mind can mould its State Unto the Shows of better Things, From earthly Chrysalis create, The perfect Form, the Angelswings! 33 Blessed, then blessed be his Name, And thine, my Love, my Spirit's Guide, Who taught his Worth, and still the same, Tho' long a Wife, art yet a Bride! ODE TO PSYCHE. 1 Let not a sigh be breathed, or he is flown! With tiptoe stealth she glides, and throbbing breast Towards the bed, like one who dares not own Her purpose, and halfshrinks, yet cannot rest From her rash Essay: in one trembling hand She bears a lamp, which sparkles on a sword; In the dim light she seems a wandering dream Of loveliness: 'tis Psyche and her Lord, Her yet unseen, who slumbers like a beam Of moonlight, vanishing as soon as scann'd! 2 One Moment, and all bliss hath fled her heart, Like windstole odors from the rosebud's cell, Or as the earthdashed dewdrop which no art Can e'er replace; alas! we learn fullwell How beautiful the Past when it is o'er, But with seal'd eyes we hurry to the brink, Blind as the waterfall; oh stay thy feet Thou rash one, be content to know no more Of bliss than thy heart teaches thee, nor think The sensual eye can grasp a form more sweet 3 Than that which for itself the soul should chuse For higher adoration; but in vain! Onward she moves, and as the lamp's faint hues Flicker around, her charmÃ«d eyeballs strain, For there he lies in undreamt loveliness! Softly she steals towards him, and bends o'er His slumberlidded eyes, as the Rose droops Its odors o'er a Lily: one caress She would but dares not take, and as she stoops, An oildrop from the lamp fell burning sore! 4 Thereat, sleepfray'd, dreamlike the God takes Wing And soars to his own skies, while Psyche strives To clasp his foot, and fain thereon would cling, But falls insensate; know! that he who gives His Love to sensual forms must fall to Earth, Ye soil the soul who seek to please the eye? Psyche! thou shouldst have taken that high gift Of Love as it was meant, that mystery Did ask thy faith, the Gods do test our worth, And ere they grant high boons our hearts would sift! 5 Hadst thou no divine Vision of thine own? Didst thou not see the Object of thy Love Clothed with a Beauty to dull clay unknown? And could not that bright Image, far above The Reach of sere Decay, content thy Thought? Which with its Glory would have wrapp'd thee round, To the Gravesbrink, untouched by Age or Pain! Alas! we mar what Fancy's Womb has brought Forth of most beautiful, and to the Bound Of Sense reduce the Helen of the Brain! WINTERFIRESIDE. 1. Winter, thy kind austerity is dear To me as Summer's sunkissed cheek or Spring With all her Bloomluxuriance: thy wing, Which withers up the Glories of the Year, And with its Touch makes Leaf and Flower sere, With it rich Compensation still doth bring, Sublimer Joys, that know no withering, By the World's Finger marked not, yet more near And dear to God for this! hail then to thee, Homefostering Season, thine the Wing that flies Bearing from Earth towards Eternity Time's choicest moments: thine the mutual Eyes And Hearts that gravitate around one high And holy centre, Love! thine are the good and wise! Here is his Altar: hither, from the height Of yon far sky, so blessing and so blest, Does He descend, and at his high behest, A thousand shapes of Edenbliss the sight Of his true votaries gladden: here his wings Alone on Earth are folded, here we see Â«His naked form alone as it should beÂ» In its true beauty, and with him he brings Soft glances, gentle words, Heartharmony, Stealing the thought from Life's vain murmurings! 2. Here He diffuses, from his noblest throne, A Mother's breast with all her young ones nigh, The Glory of His Presence, when each Eye, And Heart, and Lip and Pulse, instinctive own His allpervading Might; oh ere they're flown, Offer to God such moments: from the sky, Methinks, an Angel drops to bear on high The Smiles that mantle there ere they have grown Earthsoiled, or learnt with bitter Tears to wed. Thriceblessed smiles, we ne'er shall smile again In other days or climes, but in your stead The cold World brings us Selfishness and Pain: Our springtide Flowers are strewn above the dead And wither on the Tomb, Mementos fond, yet vain! TRUE VICTORIES. Truth has calm Conquests, where the Sword and Spear Can claim no Partânot loud or noisy, tho' Of mightiest Results: and from these flow The Blessings which with heartdeep Ties endear The Altar and the Fireside, and rear On the sublime Affections which thence grow, (Eternal Pillars, proof against each Blow Of outward Chance and selfbetraying Fear) The State's vast Fabric, on its one sure Base; For brute Force reaches not unto the Thought And Heart of Man, nor can it thence displace One Prejudiceâgreat Changes must be wrought By Men's best Feelings, thro' their ownselves: they Must work the Good for themselves, their own Way, Else it is none to them, it is as naught: Let but the inward Eye of Reason first See clear, and leave the rest to themâthe worst Of all Ways is by Force to make Men do That which alone can be reached surely thro' Their own Cooperation, their own Will And Feelings, which once forced, the Object still Remains imperfect, unattained, nay grows A bitter Evil; for the Wiseman knows That there is only one Compulsion by Which men can be sublimely, certainly Impelled to godlike Things, and that is, of Truth, divine Truth, and still diviner Love, The Constraint of the God within the Breast, Whose Fiat gained, brings over all the Rest; And what are Nerve and Sword without the Heart? As Reeds within a Child's weak Grasp at best, And with it? lessâwhat boots the meaner Part When that which is most godlike is possest? Then use them not: use Thoughts! these are the true And viewless Rundles of the Ladder of All spiritual Greatness, far above Earth's Mists they Lift us, full in God's own View, The Jacobsladder which he sometimes dÃ©scends too! NATURE AND MAN. 1. Nature ne'er toils in vainâthere's not a ray, A dewdrop, raindrop, nor a breath of Air But mingles to one mighty end: her care For coming Ages and the passing Day Provides with equal ease; she ne'er doth stray From her high Aim, like Man, but everfair, As at Creation's dawn, she still doth bear Th' Eternal's blessing, and her destined way Pursues unerringly: with sovereign Might Creating from the relics of the Past Present and future Worlds; her everbright And selfrenewÃ«d Elements outlast Man's puny monuments, and as the Blast Beareth away the Chaff, so in the Night Of dark Oblivion she wraps his pride, Giving his thoughts of Glory to the Wind: Crumbling to Dust the towering domes, whence blind And Idoladorations in old times Rayed forth their Darkness over half Mankind, Leaving a heritage of Woes and Crimes. The hundredgated Cities too must find A ready Grave, while Weeds and Wildflowers hide The sculptured Arch, in whose brief Mockery False Glory thought to live, thus all save Worth Remingles with the Dust from whence't had birth. Nature reclaims her own, mysteriously Reshaping what has withered from the Earth; Form varies still, but Matter cannot Die. 2. Ringing her mighty Changes she moves on From age to age, in vain Time waves his wing, From Past she draws the Future, from the Spring Summers and Winters endless, still the sun Shines on the grave and cradle: one by one Earth's boasted realms arise and sink, and fling Their shadows o'er the Future, like a thing Whose memory may not die, tho' all be gone That witnesses its Might and Glory to More recent Generations! still the Day Rises and sets in Beauty, their Cloudway The Storms still follow, and the starlit Dew Its sinless Tears as brightly weeps away As on the primal Eve when Earth was new! 3. And still th' eternal Ocean from his Brow Bepels the Injuries of Time, still rings The knell of Empires: on their untamed Wings Still o'er the foammaned Wave the fresh Winds blow Lifting it like a Warsteed's, 'till its snow- White crest streams on the Air: still, still Night flings Her starry Mantle o'er the Sky, still sings The Vesperbird without a Note of woe! Oh holy Nature, thou art everbright With an Ã©nduring Youth, still in thine Eye Undying beauty glows, and from thy Might Time turns, to seek some easier Victory! Still on the Storm the Rainbow sheds its Light, A sign to Man's dim Eyes unfadinglyâ 4. And tho' the Earthquake from his slumber break, 'Tis but to fecundate the Soil: thou ne'er Sowest in vain, nor shedd'st the bitter Tear O'er idle and repented hopes! the ache Of misspent Years and Means can never shake Thy quiet Breastâth' alternate Throb of Fear And feverish Joy has left no quick pulse there. Not so frail Man! for every vain Thought's sake He barters his high Heritage, and bows Brutelike to Idolgods, and flings away The present Moments, on whose wings Time sows The Seeds of future bliss. Alas! Faith's Ray Is wanting, and those seeds the chilling Snows Of profitless Oldage shall kill for aye. 5. Betwixt repentings and repinings are His Days divided: and as we by Night Stumble on Shadows, which the dubious Light Transforms to Substance, so with Truth at war, And fancyslaved, Man shuns the Real and Near For the remote and braincoined Joys whose bright And hopegilt shapes dance on before his sight, Like Motes amid the Sunbeams, ever there, Yet everdistant, cheating to the Grave, O'er which they fade into their native hue, And naught remains to witness for them, save A little Dust which Time and Wind shall strew! Alas that Centuries should fleet in vain, Like the Birdstrack, and Man no Wisdom gain! 6. Oft too Earth's great ones toil, yet leave behind No heritage of holy Lore, no trace Save that of a Shotstar, no Dwellingplace In the Heart's gratitude: th' ambitious Mind Stoops not to sow the Earth, but sows the wind, Thence reaping folly's whirlwinds which efface Sower and seed in Wrath, and strew the race Of his frail hopes in barrenness: for blind And selfish counsels call down vengeance on The Head that plots them, in the meshes caught Of Fate's wide net: yet tho' so often taught, The Moral points some idle tale alone: Truth speaks from out the Dust of Worlds gone by, A gathering tone of ages: on the ear Of heedless Time it strikes for aye, yet ne'er, Till on the brink of dread Eternity He stays his feeble flight, tho' strong and clear, Shall rouse him from his stupid Lethargy. ON NOT HATEING. Indulge in no Illwill, no Enmities, Or Enviesâe'en tho' injured, let the Thought Pass from thy Mind, as if there had been naught To trouble thee, and thus, if thou art wise, There will be really naughtâthine Enemy's Worst Malice has no Power to work thee aught Like that one Ill thou thyself mak'st, when brought To hate: this casts thee out of Paradise, Casts out the Godhead from thy Breast, and is As if into the Fountainhead of Bliss Thou hadst thrown Poison: but to love on still, And for thy Father's sake to pardon, this After a godlike Fashion keeps thy Will Pure, and thy Soul sublime and calm, like His! For where Love is, there is God too: no Space So small but can all Paradise embrace! THOUGHTS ON PAST YOUTH. Sing, sing ye Birds, and welcome in young May, And o'er his Cradle strew your fairest Dies Ye Flowers, and ye green Leaves, wheree'er he lies, By Shadows numberless hid from the Day, Make soft his Bed, and sweeten all his Way With freshest Perfumes, that when he shall rise, No Sign of Winter meet his laughing Eyes, Forgotten, like a Sorrow passed for aye: A Sorrow! lo! and at the Word, close by Joy's Side, the dimseen Spectre stands, like to His Shadow, Step for Step, forever nigh! Thus all this Loveliness I wander thro', Serves but to bring the Tear into mine Eye: And yet 'tis less of Pain, than Ecstacy! 'Tis sublimed by the Feeling of the True, The Godlike, which supplies the Dream of Youth: And who would not exchange a Dream for Truth, However sweet? thus what I have not is Far fairer, yea! e'en that which I do miss Is richer, than what others have: they dream On still, and are not yet, but only seem! And tho' these Harbingers both Youth and Spring With the fresh Heart back unto them may bring, Yet something more than Youth or Spring have I, The inward Sentiment unchangingly Of Being as a Whole, with which there is Nor Youth nor Spring, nor Time nor Place, but Bliss And Heaven, for by it we grow as one With God, and feel in all Things him alone, That is, th' Eternal! thus in Feeling we Are now what we shall really someday be, Nay, really too: for what is more real than Our Feelings? are not these the Soul of Man? And if we are the God within us, then We are more than we know, while yet mere Men, And yet by Faith, altho' we do not know All that we are, we still feel ourselves so! ON A PAINTING. Hail! blessed Art, which pour'st the bright sunbeam Upon my sight, when clouds are thick in heaven, Like flocks, before the sheepherd Southwind driven To pasture on grey mountaintops: a dream Of Summerloveliness I see: that stream Which thro' the rocks his foaming path has riven, To which a few brief pencilstrokes have given The Marks of age's workings, by the gleam Of the sunset is flushed: and, gorgeous Sight! A cloudarched rainbow mantles all the air With humid glory, while the dewdrops bright Speak of a passing shower: o'er a fair And gentle slope with woods and pastures dight, Foldwards the nibbling sheep Eve's dewy star doth light. FAITH. Yes, I will have sweet Visions: I will be A child in soul, that still my eye and ear An ample heritage of Joy may cheer: Still shall the World be clothed with Poesy, As with a Garment: dull Philosophy Shall not explain away one note I hear Of Echo's mystic voice, sent chiming clear From the deepcaverned crags: from doubt still free, By Faith I'll realize what else is naught But idle sound: as in the days of yore, With lofty Impulse shall that voice be fraught, And admonitions to the passing hour: Still shall a miracle for me be wrought By Weekdaymeans, for such is Faith's high power! PLEASURES. Say what is Pleasure? sensual joys decay, Returning to the dust from whence they came: Brute passions waste themselves in their own flame: And their spent ashes not one genial ray, To kindle up a Joy for Afterday, Retain: they desecrate this mortal frame, The temple of the soul, and leave the same A shattered tenement of mouldering clay: All these are of the Earth, and tho' enjoyed Unto the height, still surfeited and cloyed They leave us, wondering whither all has fled: True Pleasure by high faculties employed To high and during Ends is nourishÃ«d, Which flourish most, when sense grows dull and dead. WISDOM. We should do as the flowers; e'en as they From their unsightly roots derive the true Lifesap of Being, and the perfect hue Of Beauty, so should we, from day to day (Subjecting vilest things to reason's sway,) Make them subservient to higher Ends Than they seem destined for; thus Wisdom lends Value to earthly passions: her strong ray Consumes that which is gross in them, and to A calm, clear flame their nature purifies; For all things here are but as trials thro' Which the Will gains its noblest victories O'er Earth's brute foes: enduringly it plies Its task, and reaps the triomph which is due. FREEDOM. 1. What need of Uproar, Violence, and low Brute Strength, to work out such a holy End As that whereto all Goodmens 'wishes tend? Let no unfitting Means inform the Foe That we so ill true Freedom's Nature know, As to believe ourselves compelled to rend Intwain Law's holy Bonds, ere we can bend Unreason's stubborn Will to Truth! not so! Law is itself the mighty Lever by Which Wisdom works; and when the moral Weight And Strength of an whole People with it try Conclusions, it can build up a Freestate From the Foundations, yet as noiselessly, As Truth her fairest Fabrics can create! 2. Why should the millionvoicÃ«d People make Vain Uproar, like a Child! like one who knows Not his own Strength? when in the calm Repose And Consciousness of toiling for Man's sake, E'en with its slightest Whisper it can break Asunder all the Shackles Custom throws Upon its Neck, and with the viewless Blows Of Truth omnipresent destroy the Snake, The manyheadÃ«d, Prejudiceâlet each Man claim his Rights, and be the Rights of one As sacred to his Fellow as his own, For such they are if rightly looked upon! Then shall a chain be forged whose Links will reach Down to the Beggar, strong in Right to teach E'en the proud Monarch trembling on his Throne, That Spear and Sword are powerful to preach Obedience to Slaves and Fools alone! A CHURCHYARDSPORTING CHILD. I saw a child at play beside a Grave: With mouldering bones for playthings, he, most wise, Robbed death of all his terrors, and his Eyes, His laughterbeaming Eyes, no symptoms gave Of thoughts dulled by that neighbourhood, none save Such as to Afterlife stern Time denies: When we have learnt that all its mockeries, Which fret the heart's quick pulse, Hope's feverish slave, Still leave us naked on that aweful brink! Unconscious as the flowers, he did play: While selftormenting Age would stand and think How bubblelike Earth's pleasures pass away, He, great Philosopher, disdains to shrink From selfcoined fears, or lose the passing day; The grave's to him like anyother spot, For Thought, Joy's Murderer, yet haunts it not! As yet the Spectre sleeps! and there he lies, Strange Hieroglyphic of Man's Destinies, Like some full, fresh Relief by Nature's own Ingenious Hand carved upon Mankind's old Sarcophagus, by which, not so much told As hinted at, the Riddle of his Lot Is typed: how, as the Bones within it rot, From old Decay new Being straight must rise! THE PAINTER. His Lovetask's done, his task of young delight, His wide domain of pleasure, pleasure brought By Hope from a far Future, richly fraught With golden dreams, that Time, alas! may blight; Bedtime arrives, yet still he feasts his sight On his loved picture, nor can think of aught Besides: with many a wistful glance 'tis sought E're visioned sleep upon his lids can light; These are the Names for Immortality: Of such stuff are they made upon whose brows The Muses bind their wreaths: they have no eye For the world's pelf and pleasures, their heart knows But one high hope, which failing they must die, From their own breasts the world they seek for grows! SONG TO FREEDOM. 1 A Crust of Bread and Liberty, With thee, oh God, is all I seek: Content with these to live or die, A Rock, whatever Storms may break. 2 The base Heart that th'immortal Mind Entombs within the living Grave Of sensual Joys and Pleasures blind, Such Bliss as mine shall never have. 3 But shall return unto the Dust Of which 'tis made, as brute Beasts may, In Life and Death alike accurst, A barren Heart, a Soul of Clay. 4 The Monarch 'neath his gilded Ties, I envy not, not I, a Jot, I laugh at such Strawdeities, Fooled and befooling's still their Lot! 5 The Pride of Wealth, the Pomp of Power, Have naught to charm my sober Eye, I cast them in Truth's Balance sure, And up they mount, a full Mile high! 6 The Fame that from Men's false Lips won, Is less worth than the Wind's fleet Breath, The Puff of Folly, blown and gone, True Fame springs surest after Death; 7 The Seed Ambition sows on Earth Grows up apace, and fruits rightsoon, But 'tis of Ashes, and its Worth Is fitted well for Folly's Boon. 8 The Joys of Earth what matter they To one whose Mind a Kingdom is, In utter Scorn he turns away, A nobler Sceptre far is his. 9 Allhail, true heartborn Liberty, For if thy Temple be not there, Thy Worship's but a Mockery, Thy Name an empty Breath of Air. 10 There is no Prison for the Soul, It triomphs over Time and Space, And wings its Flight to that bright Goal Where Mercy shall each Woe efface. 11 I thank thee God, for thou hast given To the true Hearts that in thee Trust, A Might, which, like the Fire of Heaven, Melts e'en the Prisonbars to dust! 12 Light of our Light, Hope of our Hope, The Sun shines but for thee and thine, There is no Bliss unless we ope With Freedom's magicwand the Mine. 13 What is the golden Heavenslight, When in the Shadow dark of Death And Slavery, the Soul's true Night, The Spirit draws its stinted Breath? 14 That Light can enter not the Heart, It is no Sunshine of the Breast, It cannot soothe Despondence' smart, The Consciousness that knows no Rest. 15 Then wellcome Liberty, with thee, All Climes are fair, all Sorrows light, For the sweet Thought that we are free Makes e'en the Desert glad and bright. 16 Heir of a boundless Patrimony, The Soul may still expatiate Thro' Heaven and Earth, below on high, In Pleasures that can never sate. 17 Then give me but a Crust of Bread, Oh God, in thy high Service free, And I will yield whole Worlds instead, For where thou art, must all Things be! THE PEN. Behold the mighty Engine, which o'erthrows The Tyrant's Throne, that can controul his will, And paralyze the Hand upraised to kill; That with Thought's viewless, but resistless Blows, Can shatter down all Barriers that oppose Truth's onward Progress: with which she can still Uphold her aweful Rights, and yet not spill One Drop of human Blood! for Wisdom knows Even with such weak Instrument to break The Sword and Spear, and all the palpable Might Of Walls and Armies! yea! for she can make With this the Hearts of Men to beat aright! True Strength is in true Feeling! let this wake, And God's Rightarm is present in the Fight! THE MORAL LESSONS TO BE LEARNT FROM NATURE. Behold yon' Flower of the Field, which grows Just in my Path! the next more heedlessly May tread it down, with unobservant Eye Of its so modest Beauty: yet it throws Its Perfume on the Air, and boldly shows Its Blossoms, caring not how soon, or by What Chance, they may be marredâoh Man, and why Wilt thou not do likewise? that Flower owes Thee neither Scent nor Colour, and yet naught For this doth grudge thee! were thy Soul but wrought To such Perfection as that Flower, how, How little wouldst thou have to learn!âgo now And make it soâuntroubled by one Thought Of coming Ill, perfect thyself, wheree'er It has pleased God to place thee: thou art near To him, in every Spot alike, and that Is what the godlike Mind should labour at! Grudge no Man aught, but like that Flower be Benificent, e'en to thine Enemy, And, like it, live as if there were no Woe, For thus believing, thou wilt make it so! Happy as it, in Sunshine and in Shower, Blooming content, tho' but for one brief Hour. Life, rounded by one little Day, if quite Enjoyed is perfectâis all that it might Or could be madeâa thousand Years could not Make it more truly Life, no, not one Jot! ODE TO PSYCHE. 1 Why stand'st thou thus at Gaze In the faint Tapersrays, With strainÃ«d Eyeballs fixed upon that Bed? Has he then flown away, Lost, like a Star in Day, Or like a Pearl in Depths unfathomÃ«d? Alas! thou hast done very ill, Thus with thine Eyes the Vision of thy Soul to kill! 2 Thought'st thou that earthly Light Could then assist thy Sight, Or that the Limits of Reality Could grasp Things fairer than Imagination's Span, Who communes with the Angels of the Sky? Thou graspest at the Rainbow, and Wouldst make it as the Zone with which thy Waist is spanned! 3 And what find'st thou in his Stead? Only the empty Bed! And what is that when no more hallowed by Imagination? a mere Sty For Sensualism to wallow in, To which thy Fault is near akin; Thou sought'st the Earthly and therefore The Heavenly is gone, for that must ever soar! 4 For the bright World of Pure and boundless Love What hast thou found? alas! a narrow Room! Put out that Light, Restore thy Soul its Sight, For better 'tis to dwell in outward Gloom, Than thus, by the vile Body's Eye, To rob the Soul of its Infinity! 5 Love, Love has Wings and he Soon out of Sight will flee, Lost in far Ether to the sensual Eye, But the Soul's Vision true Can track him, yea! up to The Presence and the Throne of the Most High: For thence he is, and tho' he dwell below, To the Soul only he his genuine Form will show! Oh Psyche, Psyche, 'tis by our own Thought That Heaven's Gifts to fit Use must be wrought, But what the Soul itself can scarcely grasp, Thou in thine Arms wouldst sensually clasp! THE POET. 1. He should not live alone, but in the bright And holy intercourse of Heart with Heart: This keeps it healthy, and makes clear the Sight; And Fancy with Life's coarse, stale Bread, when rightâ -Ly mixed improves it much, a little Leaven Will leaven the whole Lump, a Touch of Heaven Sublimes in Life's Ingredients what is base, Else his quick Spirit wears the vital part Turning against itself with ceaseless smart Of fretting Thoughts and Fancies, 'till the light Of heaven is given back in partial rays, Or with false brightness from the clouded soul: Which, like an illfed Lamp, no more can blaze With pure and steady radiance, a Whole At unity within itself, but strays In smouldering Flashes far from its true goal. Those only a divine Refreshment win From Fancy's Fount, who thereat learn to slake A heavenly Thirst, but to the Taste of Sin, Each Drop is Bitterness, a fresh Heartache. 2. The World is not for him, nor such as he, Whose hearts are, like the Nightingale's, all Song And Melodyâhe fain wonld dream that wrong, Cold hate, and selfishness, may never be Sown on his path by time, that ever free From the low Passions of the wrangling Throng, His Soul may dwell apart! alas, ere long, He too must pluck from off Life's bitter Tree The Fruit of Knowledge like the rest, and know Youth's Edengates are shut on him for aye! That thro' this world of Prose he too must go, Must see his bright world fading far away, Compelled to draw the Breath, so vile and low, As seems to him, of this familiar Day!â 3. Youth is a Magicmantle, which we fling Around us, and among our Fellows, we Breathe, move as they, but not of them: we see A Land of Promise, where on golden Wing Eternal Pleasure broods: Pain with Life's Spring As yet has mixed no Bitterness. With Arms Outspread, we seek to grasp a World of Charms, An Immortality of Blissâbut ere They meet upon our Breast, all disappear! Oh 'tis a bitter Feeling, thus to wake From the sweet Dreams of Youth, and feel alone On this, cold, selfish Earth: the bright world blown By Fancy's divine Breath, wherein we make Our Fairysodjourn, where our young Hearts slake Their first, deep Thirst, from Fountains of their own, Burst like a Bubble, and for ever gone. No more, no more, oh never more the Heart Such Honey for its Hive may set apart. So think'st thou, yet not rightly. Life there is Real, sober Life, beyond that Dream of Bliss! A Magic, that to Sense's dull Eye can Make real the World which as a Dream began, That World exists, the Hall of Wonder too Is here: make but thine Eye first fit to view, For 'tis more vast than even Fancy's Span; And then, as if the World were chrystal, thro' It shalt thou trace the meaning of the plan! Then wake, thou young Daydreamer, from thine Eye Dash the vain teardrop, still life's Duties high Will yield a nobler Worldâa surer Way To Bliss: Life's beaten Highroad, tho' it may Seem unpoetic, must be trodden by The true Apostles of Humanity. Then be not thou ashamed to tread where they Have gone before theeâthe true Poesy Of Life is in the Heart, and everywhere This Fount is flowing if thou has the Art To find it: let not then thine own be dry. The highest Poetry is that which can Grasp and sublime the daily Life of Man. For Man is godlikeâwhat concerns him then Asks and inspires the sublimest Pen: Calls for the Poet's heart and Prophet's eye. Then go, mix with thy Fellownen, go share Their Sorrows and their Joys: graft thine own Heart On every Heart, thus as one shall it bear The Impress of what all together are, The Godlikeâyea, of God himself! then dare Still to despise the World, yet in it play thy Part! 4. The Heart should beat in holy unison With kindred Hearts, as star shines back on star In the same constellation, which afar, United, shed a wider Light than one By one, could singly fling: 'tis Love alone By which man nears his Maker: far and near, With his bright zone of beauty, Sphere to Sphere, World unto World, and Heart to Heart, and Sun To Sun, he binds; from the Earth's meanest thing, Yea! from the Worm, by Link and Link, on high To his Skythrone he mounts, beneath his wing Gathering all shapes of Being! oh that I Might win unto my verse his Ministring, For he can turn e'en dross to Gold of Poesy! LOVE. E'en Superstition, when the soul of Love Hath entered into it, is holy made; So beautiful, almost it might persuade Us to believe, that he, who up above Knows each least heartpulse, would not e'en reprove The Error and the Ignorance, arrayed In Faith's pure garb, unconsciously display'd In forms which God's own word doth disapprove! The spirit makes the form: and if there be No Love, 'tis all but idle ceremony Where no worth is; one prayer will fail of Grace, Tho' perfect in all points of orthodoxy; While that which Superstition's forms deface, Can e'en to these win divine ministry! DUTY. Would everyman but of his duty do A tithe, this Earth were as a Paradise! Then would the victory be for the wise, The good, and virtuous, and not unto The sword and spear, the brutestrong, who undo Their fellowmen and rend intwain the ties Which bind all hearts to holy ministries: Those ministries, which, like pure ore, run thro' The common bosom of this weekdaylife; But we do lend ourselves to brutish strife, Blind tools in a blind hand: we violate Truth, Justice, Mercy, and ourselves deprive Of their high blessings, learning, but too late, That on all sin selfpunishment must wait. TIME. Time has as many faces as the year Has days, or the day hours, every one Doth vary, even as we look upon It through the Medium of Hope or Fear; One sees but smiles, another, naught but sere And wrinkled traces left by Joys long gone; The wiseman welcomes each, a Friend unknown Who for him may good testimony bear, When every other witness pleads in vain; Of Judgment's aweful scales one small sandgrain May turn the balance, and Eternity By these despisÃ«d fractions man must gain; 'Tis ours to turn the moments as they fly, To gold that shall pass current up on high! OLDAGE. 1 Oh bitter Age, that leaves us all alone On this cold, selfish Earth, e'en as it were A blighted Tree, while round us young and fair Are putting forth their Leaves of Joy, o'ergrown With springtide verdure, in strange contrast shown With our most sapless boughs: alas! stern care Grows doubly 'neath the snows of age: 'tis there He lays his icy Hand on us, and one By one, the Heart its Joys aside must lay, Too old to make new Ties: oh let me be Snatched from this Earth, ere yet the last faint Ray Of bliss be fledâlet me not live to see The graves of those I love, but pass away Ripe yet not old, as seasoned fruits drop from the Tree! 2 Oh who would ask the barren boon Years? That Chrse which selfish souls alone can bear; When the Heart shut within itself, of Air, Love's vital Air deprived, no hopes or fears Save for its own base being feels. Time sears The noblest spirits most, for these must share Their Hearts with other Hearts, to live: 'tis there His gifts are desolation; each Year wears The Temper of the Soul, and dulls the keen Edge of enjoyment. true Hearts ne'er survive The Hearts they love, but like Roseleaves, I ween, When one has dropt, the rest halfwithered live But for a Moment and then fall unseen. Is it to live, when Life's no honey in the Hive? ON USING THE PRESENT. Fools that we are, each year ebbs quick away To the dark Ocean of the Past, and sows No Seeds of Wisdom on Time's Shore: so throws The Wave its barren Birth of Noise and Spray Upon the unproductive Strand: thus aye, At each Year's End, untaught by former Woes, We vainly stretch our arms to clutch the shows Of coming Bliss, as Babes at times would lay Their young Hands on the Moon, and deem it nigh. We laugh at them, as tho' forsooth we were Less Fools than they; but Fate to Mockery Still turns the puny thoughts with which men dare To grasp the Future, and a barren lie Is all Time brings, to teach them what they are! TRUE STRENGTH. Wouldst thou know what true strength is? ask of Him, The great Doubtsolver, He will bid thee look Back to when Fame from her broad trumpet shook, With her whole Breathing, names which now are dim, Whose works are dust, for of their life, a whim, A selfish glory was the only aim: And thus they sunk to whence their trophies came! For those alone which Time approves, by Time Are spared; look once again, and thou shalt see Names which Fame's trump scarce deigned to whisper forth, Grown into types of Glory and of Worth, To Blessings wide as air; so let it be! For thus are Truth and Wisdom justified Of all their children, tho' by fools denied!â THE GRAVE. The Grave! what is there in that name to wake Unpleasing thoughts, or image of decay? The flowers shun it not, the sweet birds play And sport around it, why should we then make Our fancies busy thro' the Earth to break, And see the fleshless bones that 'neath it may Be crumbling into dust? oh rather say, Â«See, from decay how soon new life doth take Its natural Being, even so shall we! A mighty teacher is the Grave; one hour Spent in a Churchyard, from the world set free, And all its nothingness, will teach thee more Of life, and thy own Being's mystery, Than the vain theories of man's booklore! POVERTY. Giver of hidden gifts! sweet Poverty, Heartchastener, yet in Love: tho' thou art one That walk'st on Earth unwelcom'd, and men shun Thy face of veilÃ«d beauty, where we see But a faintraying glory, as may be Starlight thro' mists, which seem as tho' they shone Dimeyed on this cold Earth, where Care has run With Sin his Rounds, mocking Man's hollow Glee And lipconstrainÃ«d mirth, yet thou, like these, Art bright beneath as Truth: the filmy Veil Which dims, is on the Eye alone that sees Thee thro' its sensual medium; tho' pale, 'Tis not the curse that dulls the Bed of Ease, The worn Heart, the Affections false and stale! THE STREAM. Here will I stretch me, thou sweetbabbling Stream, And, listening to thy merry carol, make My Heart as Light as thine: here will I shake Off, like a wornout vest, the thoughts, I deem, Thou never lent'st thy Music to: how gleam The frolic bubbles on thy wave, and break Not like Man's fretting hopes, for these no ache Leave on thy quiet Breast; oh it doth seem A goodly sight to see thee bounding on This passing Day, as bright as when the Sun First lit thy laughing Waters: not one stain Of least pollution in them, no not one Sole drop of bitterness; 'gain and again, Thou minglest with thy Source in Dew and Rain! ODE ON A GREEK-VASE. 1 Oh! Time, how gently hath thy hand, which falls So heavy, in its silence, on the Pride And Pomp of ages, and on Tyrants' walls, Conveyed this antique Vase, wherein abide Voices and Echos of a bygone day: Dreams of the Past, of Glories now no more; Which, like the murmurs from the seaborn shell, Haunt it from that far world, from whence its ray Of Inspiration comes; oh Time thy Power Has fallen on it with a gentle Spell, 2 A quiet Hallowing, which man's works still Must wait for, 'till they have become as thine: 'Till thou has taken them from him, to fill Them with Tradition's magic and entwine Thoughts of eternal things with passing forms! Thou hast dealt with this relique of old days, As with thy lapchild, save of novelty, Robbing its form of naught; around it plays The halo of forgotten years, whose storms Have scathed it not nor marred its tracery! 3 Oh wonderful the spell of Soul, wheree'er It dwells, in words, or hues, or stone express'd, A something not of them, yet ever there, Making the common clay its power attest; And here Time's fleeting elements are made The types of changeless, calm Eternity; Yon brook in silverfoam, that dashes down Yon suncliff's brow, then flashes thro the shade, Emblems, in moving immobility, A changelessness in Nature not its own! 4 And on its Wildflowerbrink a happy band, Where forth in light it dances from the shade, As fixed by stroke of some enchanter's wand, Are seated, where the sunproof boughs have made A pleasant Covert, lushgrown Eglantines, With Honeysuckles making sweet the air: Still dewbesprent and cool, tho' midday shines; Whence come ye, happy souls, from what far land, Where never sun shone on a brow of care, Nor time your hours of bliss e'er marred or spann'd? 5 Ye call unto my thought some pleasant dream, Which I have had in my own boyish days, When not yet disinherited we seem To scatter from our eyes the Heavensrays, And wear upon our Backs the Angels' wings: And there ye are, and there ye still will be, In your own joyous merriment the same, Howe'er o'er us frail mortals Time may flee, Bringing and bearing off but earthly things, Thus warning us to seek a higher aim!â 6 Farewell! yet at some future day I hope To meet such faces and such smiles as yours, In a far land that gives us nobler scope For Being, than this sinworn mould of ours: A blessed place, where all that's noblest here, Perfected, purified, shall live again: Where all the Aspirations, Faculties, That slept in us, or dimmed by hope and fear, Shall wake in beauty 'neath those ampler skies, Realities, not longings formed in vain! TIME. 1. 'Tis not to measure time, to mark each hour, Each moment, and each second, as they fly Upon a Clock: the true Timepiece doth lie But in the Heart: there let us ask his power And worth, the use we put him to, what dower The mighty one has left us: miscry And barrenness, or selfcontent with high And holy thoughts, true Honey in life's flower. For Life is not made up of fourscore years, Of ninety, or a hundred, but of deeds, By which Man works his Maker's praise, and rears A lasting heritage: few years the seeds Of life eternal want, so Time but bears Moments wellspent, God asks no more, nor Justice needs! 2. Alas, shortsighted mortals that we are! We measure Time but as a part of nigh And fleeting Time, not of Eternity, And estimate amiss: thus in the snare Selflaid we fall: we neither know nor care To know its relative worth, for erringly We look but at this Â«Now:Â» thus the Mindseye, Falseruled and used to Dwarfviews, has no Art To measure true proportion, or compare Great things with small: and as fond Childhood deems His Holyday an age, and hives each part As tho' it were life's all, so too it seems Man clings to Earth, forgetful of his Dreams And Hopes sublime, and gives away his Heart To Mammon for the Dross which idly gleams. NIGHTSTORM. 1. There is a breathless stillness in the sky, But not of rest: the clouds in sullen speed Are mustering, from all quarters, to some deed Of darkness, and in Soughs the Winds moan by: Tis thus the Mind its evil Energy Summons to some fell Act, yet shrinks in dread Anticipation of the crime: o'er head The vault of Heaven darkens momently, As with a scowl of hate: while Earth below, Like one intently listening, stirless lies, Yet quivering with Suspense, ere yet the blow Descend: but hark! the bosom of the Skies Is rent asunder, and in headlong flow, The Entrails of the storm rush forth with hellish noise. 2. See how the murky clouds are rent in twain By the indignant Thunderflash, that leaps Forth to the glorious strife, ploughing the deeps With light unutterable: then again Thick darkness shrouds the earth, and the loud rain Pours down on the mad blast: and now there sweeps, Such as might dazzle e'en the eye that sleeps In the still Tomb, a flash that turns the rain Into a liquid fireshower, a stream Of diamonddrops, while Earth seems poised in Air, A Scene of fairy wonders, and each gleam Reveals her to the sateless sight more fair In preternatural beauty, 'till she seem Created out of sights and sounds that never were Dreamt of in Poet's wildest Phantasy! Haw far Reality can triomph o'er Man's dim Conceptions, and the shallow Lore On which he prides himself: but see, the Sky Works free from Rack, and the dark Vapors fly, Like Birds of evil Omen, from the Power Of kindlier Elements, that now once more Resume, as due, the shortlived Mastery Yielded to evil Things: and the mad Wind But late so fierce, shrinks moaningly away, In consciencestricken Tones, which seem to say, Â«The Deed is finished:Â» like the evil Mind That contemplates, when Passions cease to blind, The fatal Crime, and shrinks from Reason's Sway! FANCY. Fancy, sweet Fancy, Balm of every Woe, Binder of broken Hearts! who liv'st for aye 'Mid Pleasures flown, or Hopes of future Day: Thou, unto whom the Present, this dark Now, Is but a Point, a Restingplace below, On which thy wingÃ«d Feet but seldom lay Their airy Weight, like Bird upon a Spray, But with more boyant Spring, from all Earth's low, Dull Cares to soar, to that Eternity Of Thought and Hope, thro' which thou lov'st to wing Thy viewless Flight: to thy true Votary Thy wonted Aid now grant: around me fling Thy Magicmantle, bear me up on high, To where my loved Ones with the Angels sing! MY BIRTHDAY. My Birthday! even so: this very Day This idle Heart began Life's eager Race: Sixty Pulsations in a Momentsspace! Is that the Tune to which it beats then?âaye, But Hope and Fear have stirred it oft: their Sway Is as a Tyrant's, and must leave some Trace On the jarred StringsâDespondence too a Place Has claimed in their wild Revels: oh Life's Way Lies thro' a Tanglewood, where Fruits of Hue Most seemingfair grow on Sin's Upastree, Sighttempting, but within most rank: the true Are often hard to find, and ill to see, Not tricked out with a showy Rind to woo The Sense, they must be sought for earnestly! TO MY FATHERLAND. 1 My Fatherland, my Fatherland! Should I ne e'r greet again Thy slaveuntrod and wavekissed Strand, My Heart would beat in vain. 2 I love thee with a swelling, deep, Unutterable Love, Like the eternal Waves which sweep And bribeless round thee move. 3 Their Voice, tho' harsh to foreign Ears, Is Music unto thee, For who the Waves eternal hears, Hears God'bid him be free! 4 Freedom looked down on Ocean's brow And left her Image there, And in the boundless Mirror now Undimmed doth it appear! 5 His mighty Voice is to her Ear The sound she loves the best, Nor could Man's boundless Hope be e'er More boundlessly exprest! 6 The very Winds that wake the Wave Have Freedom in their Sound, And where they breathe, call forth the Brave Like Springflowers from the Ground! 7 Then airfree be our Thoughts to smite The Tyrant and the Slave, The Poet's heart be bold and light And bribeless as the Wave. 8 For Thought has then an Edge above The keenest Glaive: than Light More swift: when Truth wields it, we prove Its true immortal Might. 9 My Fatherland! oft on thy Shore I've called upon the Past For Oracles, to learn before They spring, what Seeds are cast. 10 I've gazed upon the far, bright Track Which thou has left behind In Time's dark Ocean, and traced back Thy Energies of Mind. 11 But Fears come o'er me in these Days Which put in Wealth their Trust, For Hearts which sordid Gold repays, Like it, are of the Dust! 12 Once more, once more, snatch up the Brand Of Truth, which smouldering lies, And with it kindle in each Land The Spark which never dies. 13 A flickering Flame at first't may rise Oft baffled by the Wind, But soon shall tower to the Skies, A Firecolumn of Mind! 14 Think'st thou the God, whose Voice first called Thee from th' Abyss of Time, Thy smiling Fields with waves has walled For Safety unto Crime? 15 Not so! he made thee strong and free And clothed thee with his Might, That Will with Power should agree, To work him Deeds of Light. 16 Each Wave that breaks upon thy Shore, Each Wind that o'er thee blows, Should waft the Nation's Blessings o'er, And hallow thy Repose. 17 Mercy should dwell within thy Breast, Clear Honour in thine Eye, In Joy and Sorrow alike blest With a World's Sympathy. 18 A Blessing on thy Fields should fall, On every Blade of Grass, And e'en thy very Sorrows, all O'er thee should lightly pass. 19 Thy voice should be as God's, who gave His four Winds unto thee, Like wingÃ«d Ministers, to save, To succour and set free. 20 The Nations all should seek from thee An omen of Success, And crown the Deeds that set them free With thy unbought Caress. 21 Thy Name should be a Watchword and A Beacon in the Night, In War, a streaming Meteorbrand, In Peace, a Pillar of Light! 22 Ask of sad History's teeming Page Ambition's vulgar Fate, What have they earned who with Truth wage, Time's Scorn, Man's lasting Hate! 23 Wildivy triomphs o'er the Pride And haughtiest Works of Man, A few short years, and grass will hide What Conqueror's began. 24 How silent Nature mocks the poor, Poor Graspings of Man's Brain, Thus teaching how his Works endure, In Birth and End so vain. 25 'Tis Giantworth alone can stand The Test of Time and Fate, He is the same in every Land, His Being has no Date! 26 Tho' Empires fall, and Worlds be rent, He stands as firm as Heaven, For with his Might God's Truth is blent, Time naught to him has given! TRUE GREATNESS I love to see a great Man simply great, With nothing but the Halo of his own Calm Glory on his Brow to make him known! What needs the Pomp and Pride of empty State? The knowing Eye will soon discriminate Real Worth in whatsoever Guise 'tis shown, Sublime in Rags or humble on a Throne! True Greatness still can for itself create Respect by Life's most common Agencies; And still its highest Mastery is to Develop grandly, in each weekday Thought And Act, the divine Lore with which 'tis fraught, No Matter what the Means, all, all that lies Before it, it can turn to uses new: Trace in Life's vile and trodden Dust the true, The golden Vein, and work it for the Skies. For Greatness is not to be more than Man, But to be Man! And this the meanest can Become; the noblest Crown is still worn by The modest Brow of pure Humanity! The King of Men is he who here below Is most a Man, and Christ was truliest so, Then whom to follow ye already know! REVOLUTIONISTS. 1. Ye Fools, who with the vilest Things would gain The holiest of Blessings. Liberty; The Means destroy the Worth of that ye try To win, and when acquired make it vain As Light unto the Blindâye need not strain The Nerve, or grasp the Sword: the Victory She loves, is o'er a nearer Enemy, E'en your ownselves! And when ye can restrain Your Passions, then ye have no other Foe, Then are ye free! But Violence and Blood Alike unfit ye to receive or know That Blessing: from within comes all its Good, But ye are no more in a fitting mood, The only Source from whence it e'er can flow Within yourselves, ye have destroyed, nor could Ye now be free tho' all your Foes lay low! 2. Wisdom delights in Gentleness, and Thought Can pass thro' Gates and break the Prisoner's Chain, When meaner Instruments would work in vain: It knows no Obstacles, for there is nought Can check it. as St. Peter once was brought Forth by the Angel from his Place of Pain, So to the inmost Prison Thought can gain Admittance, Thought, the Angel, who has wrought So many Wonders for Mankind, and still Works more and more; like to the gentle Light With its calm Beauty all things doth it fill, And moulds them by its soft yet Giantmight, 'Till blending all Men's Minds in one pure Will, It realize all Blessings fair and bright! ON THE SPIRIT OF REFLECTIVE HUMANITY. Oh think not that thy Time is thrown away When gazing on a passing Cloud or Flower; Nay, even shouldst thou stand fixed for an Hour To watch a little Child, or Cat at Play Tho' but with a sere Leafâ there is a Way Of viewing even these Things, by which more Real Wisdom may be gained than lies before The proud Philosopher in many a Finetitled Quartoâ each of these is too A Leaf in Nature's Volume, which the Eye Of natural Love alone can read; the trueâ -Est Wisdom is a Heart full of all high And gentle Feelings: so o'erflowingly Filled with Affection as to stoop unto The meanest Thing, or spare the Flowers which lie Before its Path in thousands: they are too A Wonder of the living God, and by The feeling Heart not injured wantonly! Oh well for him, who early learns thus thro' A comprehensive, deep Humanity, To view all Things as Objects of one Love, As comprehended all in him above! For he who spares the Flower, will not be Unmoved at Sight of human Misery! This is the greatest Wealth, all Wealth in one, And where this is not, trust me there is none! And oh! deem not these small Things Trifles, this Is the great Error: for indeed it is Harder to be in small Things great, than to Rise now and then to great Things; for to do This, we must be habitually great, And such a Habit no man can create By Fits and Starts: by daily practice he Acquires it, and this must ever be Made up of socalled small Things, which we by Despising make so: but that which calls thy Best Feelings forth, should not seem small to thee, Nor will it, if it does, assuredly! TO A. P. 1 And wilt thou too forget me, Love, Or deem of me but as of one Whose Fate with thine no more is wove, As one whom henceforth thou wouldst shun? 2 Our Vows were Summervows 'tis true, Their Links were wove in dreaming Youth, Yet Love the golden Metal drew Fresh from the glowing Forge of Truth. 3 What tho' rude Time should wear or tine The mere Gloss at the Surface, still The genuine Substance 'neath will shine, Tested, but changed not by Life's Ill! 4 Upon my young, unwithered Heart Love shed his first, divinest Dews, And all Life's Honey set apart Was tinged and flavored by his Hues. 5 And wouldst thou then unkindly turn Those Sweets to Bitterness and Strife, Or blight a Heart that still must yearn With Love towards thee in Death and Life? 6 I dare not, cannot, will not dream That thy pure Heart has selfish grown, That from thy Brow a single Beam Of Immortality is flown. 7 They tell me thou art changed too, Love, That Care sits on thy oncefair Brow, I know thy gentle Heart must move With Pity at another's Woe; 8 Yet robbed of all that made thee bright, Of every youthful Charm and Hue, Thou art but dearer to my Sight, Thy Griefs shall make me but more true. 9 For in the Tablet of my Heart Thy Form still blooms all fresh and fair, I see not what in Time thon art, But what thou wert when imaged there. 10 Thus on the Canvass some fair Face Still smiles undimmed, unfadingly, When the Original no Trace Retains to tell of Days gone by. 11 The Love of two pure Hearts is like A Tune on some sweet Instrument, 'Tis true on different Chords we strike, But Harmony is in Sounds blent. 12 The Moment they have left the Strings The Tones are mingled soft in Air, And blent for aye, like kindred Things Made each for each, one Being share. 13 Thus shall our Hearts form but one Sound, One Tune, tho'in a varying key, In Joy and Sorrow alike found Still linked in faultless Harmony. 14 And when the Heartstrings cease to beat, The Magicchords, the Spiritslyre, Our Souls shall seek their primal Seat, And in eternal Love respire! MAKE NO LIFEPLAN. 1. The Folly of all Follies, in my Eyes, Is to strive towards one given End: thereon To set our Hearts and Wishes, as if none, But that could make us happy: to despise For its Sake all the pleasant Way which lies Betwixt us and our Object: which, when won, Like a Childsbauble, will soon pall upon The Senseâso long as unpossessed a Prize Of richest Seeming, but in Fact, mere Show. To fret at every Hindrance, for its Sake. To sweat, and toil, and pucker up the Brow, This is indeed of fancied Good to make Real Evilâ for the Means away to throw The End! the Goodâ the Soul! for which we take Such idle Pains â the greatest Good below, And whence the Worth of all the rest must flow. And if thy Soul be injured, if thy Mind Be distuned, where wilt thou Life's Music find? 2. Life's Happiness is never made up by One Act or Point thereof, it is like to A viewless Chain, the last Link holding true Together with the first: Fools only try To crowd into one Moment Joys that lie Strewn over an whole Life: the Drop of Dew Does what a thousands Drops could never do, Because it does the Needful only! thy Soul then should do the same â unto the Day Sufficient is the Good thereof: the Heart Cannot be more than fullâ and if, I say, With daily Bliss thou hast the sublime Art To keep it so, what need is there then, pray, By overfilling it to lose a Part? Or even, (for too great Bliss has its Smart,) Thus to draw forth the Sting that hidden lay; For wisely Providence thus makes thee pay For rash Abuse, to teach thee what thou art. 3. Lay not then out a Plan for Life, nor dream Of a particular Mode, as that alone Wherein thou canst be happy, go thou on, Live thy Life as it comes: least of all deem Things indispensible which only seem So to thee, because thou hast fixed upon That Plan; they are so to that Plan, I own, But not to Life: to that but little is So really, else the Poor would have in this World a sad Lot: whereas by deeming naught Superfluous indispensible, they miss It not, but come to value, as they ought, The truly Indispensible as more So unto them, and just because so poor In other Goods: all Situations teem Alike with Life's best Elements, for by The Heart we live, and where can that not beat? And Life's best Elements, what are they? thy Own calm, contented Thoughts, the sacred Heat Of gentle Feelings and Affections high; And where are these best found?â there only Seat Is in thyselfâ oh then be consciously That self, and all that this same Consciousness Brings with it, that in calm Content possess! 4. And to do so, strive towards one End alone, With thy whole Heart and Soul; but let it be Naught earthly, thus wilt thou move surely on Towards it, for naught here can hinder thee, Or check thee in the leastâ e'en Poverty And Want, which mar so many a mortal Plan, Enrich with Means to perfect the Â«true Man!Â» And knowing this, thou mak'st Â«the ManÂ» thy Care, The Soul â which perfect, all Things perfect are! FAITH. Yea, there are Griefs, and bitter sufferings To be endured on Earth, Griefs that might make Us heavy hearted, and it might be slack In the good Cause at times, had we not Wings To lift us from the fret of earthly Things, And give unto our Souls that which we lack In this Life's fleeting forms: like the Cloudrack Which Evening o'er the Sunsetheaven flings, These are shapemoulded by a higher power To the Soul's secret Uses: as the sun Thro' lazyflakÃ«d clouds his light doth shower, Kindling them into types of things which none On Earth have e'er beheld, so Faith's high Lore From Time can draw a timeoutlasting dower! ALL GOOD SELFDERIVED. How few Men are all that which they might be! How few possess themselves, their Souls, or know What divine Blessings may be made to grow, Like precious Fruits, where they as yet can see But Thorns and Barrenness on Life's fair Tree! With their own Thoughts they can make all Things so, So lovelyâ Spring bids not more Dayseyes blow, With her first Breathings, on some grassy Lea, Than they can call forth Joys: we ourselves make The Beautiful we seek forâ we must wake Ere we can quicken that which round us lies. The Lyre has in itself no Harmonies: Nor the Seashell no Murmurs, 'till the Ear Be put to it: and all this fair World here, With the vast Compass of its Melodies, Is but as a sweet Lyre, which the Hand E'en of a Child can easily command: Is but as the Seashell: the Spirit, by Which it is haunted ever, we can hear But with the inner Ear, then all the high And glorious Hymn sweeps on us full and clear. But we must be first tuned ourselves, for we Are as a String in the grand Harmony: For how, oh how! can a jarred String be made To play its Part, or feel that which is played? And wisely God has left each human Soul To tune itself with this stupendous Whole: This is its End, its Mission 'neath the Sky! LONDON. The Heart of mighty England art thou, and Thy pulses beat unto the Ocean's shore, Waking tenthousand Hearts that slept before, Bound with the electric chain of Mind: from Land To Land thy strong Voice shouts, and Freedom's brand, Bequeathed us by the glorious race of yore, Is handed onward, brightening more and more, Thro' Time's stillchanging mists, by Truth's breath fanned! O God, grant that this mighty Heart for thee And Truth alone may beat: that thus for aye, In every Land and Clime, the good and free May turn to England her best praise to say, Â«Thence was the dawn of Liberty, and we Walk in the light of a reflected Day!Â» FAINTHEARTEDNESS. The Coward and the Slave alone despair, The Patriot hopes: for come what may, still he Is what he will within himself, still free, In the best Sense of Freedomâ Sun and Air Ripen the backward Fruit: the Tree must bear If the Soil whence it springs be good and strong: A generous Cause the Heavens will not wrong, All natural Influences are with the fair And holy Efforts of the good and wise! The universal heart beats with them still! Be man but true unto himself, the prize Is his alreadyâ but Mistrust doth kill. For where there is no Faith, high Heaven denies Its miracles, the heritage of steady Will! ON SELFLIMITING. 1. That which at first contracts thy Liberty, Cramps thee in real Life's seemingscanty Space, Instead of Fancy's wide Domain, will place Thee in thy Sphere of best Activity, And make thee in the End more truly free: Concentrate all thy Powers, and thus brace Thy Soul to its high Task, untill it face Its Lot, in calm Content, whate'er it be. Within its Banks the Stream flows strong alone, Diffuse it and it stagnates, or grows weak. Restraint is Freedom's Essence: Limits known And fixed are needfull that the Soul may seek Its full Development, attained by none Who from Man's proper Sphere of Action break. 2. The highest Greatness which a Being can Attain, is to be itself, and to this, God himself, when he made it what it is, Whatever that may be, Dog, Rose, or Man, With full Means each has furnished â he then who Forsakes Man's Sphere, cannot attain to his True Greatness, nor that only must he miss, But every other: for 'twould be a new, Strange Mode of Being to him, and God has Not furnished him with Means or Powers thereto, For he ne'er destined one Thing to be two! How foolish then beyond that Sphere to pass, Where merely being what insensibly Our Nature leads us to become, we grow Both great and happy, and so easily, As scarce the Why or How thereof to know! TO MILTON. Milton! I envy thee thy misery, If such it were, whose Magictouch could turn The Mortal to a God: for thou didst earn By soretried faith, thine Immortality! Sorrow and Suffering bear a meaning high, And are but veilÃ«d Blessings, tho' in stern And unseductive garb their worth we learn: They are Heavensguests, who, welcomed heartily, A Blessing leave behind, unknown before. Such did they prove to thee, their noble host, For from their Lips thou learnd'st a mightier Lore Than Earth's cold, proud Philosophy can boast: A balm against all ills, all fond hopes lost, Its worth the more 'twas used, still growing more! THE PASSINGBELL. Hush! hark! whence is yon' Sound that booms along, Waking deep Echos over Wood and Stream, Saddening the Scene until its beauty seem Clouded by some dark Meaning. E'en the song Of the blithe Nightingale floats on among The Leaves less joyously: on Fancy's dream It breaks, like some harsh voice: to few I deem Is its note welcome, for it wakes a throng Of buried Phantoms! 'tis the Passingbell, Speaking of fond ones severed from Love's breast, And in its tone is anguish: it can tell Its Tale with Eloquence to match the best Of Tongues: yet to schooled hearts it sounds no knell, But calls the wandering thoughts to their high nest! NEMESIS. What is it that mine Eyes look on? A bodyless Hand that bears A Dagger, and upon Its Blade are Bloodgouts! is't a Dream That with its fearful Semblance sears My strainÃ«d Eyeballs, or does that bright Gleam Flash from a Weapon palpable to Touch? Dread Nemesis! I know thee: such The Shape in which from oldest Time Unseen thou stand'st by thronÃ«d Crime, And with upraisÃ«d Hand, Awaiting Fate's Command, Thy aweful and invisible Stroke Smites him, e'en then when he has broke Intwain all Bonds that Fear, And Policy, and Guile, and Hate, Had bade him wear; E'en then, when in his Pomp and State, A Criminal too vast for Law's weak Grasp, He treads down Truth and Virtue in the Dust, And feasts his Ears with their Deathgasp; As tho' oblivious Rust Could blunt the Edge of thy dread Steel, Or thine allviewless Arm could feel The Palsy of Decay! Vain Fool! amid the glittering Spears That compass him around thy Way Is airfree, no Footfall he hears, Yet, like his guilty Conscience, thou Art with him everywhere: And when he least expects the Blow, Thine errless Arm is there, To lay the Tyrant low, And bid fair Liberty Lift up once more her Banner to the Sky. 'Twas thou didst place in Brutus' Hand Thy crimeavenging Steel, And bad'st him save his Fatherland From Slavery, He made the haughty CÃ¦sar feel That Kings like common Men can die. The first Step o'er the Rubicon, And by his Side from that day on Thy aweful Form', veiled from his Sight, Stood by him in its viewless Might, In its Shadow aye he stood, Yet dreamt not of the coming Blood, 'Till the Hourssands had run, And CÃ¦sar's Life with them was done! But thou hast other Weapons, nobler far Than these frail, palpable Tools, With which to war Against the Tyrant, who to his vain Car Would chain Mankind â Pride that befools And maketh dizzy on the Pinnacle, Where Fortune leaves her Votary To look aghast into the yawning Hell Whence rise the Ghosts of former Crimes, Dread Shadows of past Times, To smite his Soul with Agony! What are the palpable Throes Of bodily Wounds compared with those Which Conscience, to thy Service sworn, Inflicts on Guilt, of every Solace shorn: What tho' the Tyrant triomph o'er his Foes, And make the Block holy wiih Martyrsblood, The one Voice he has quenched shall spread abroad On the four Winds of Heaven, And unto every Tongue be given Some Echo of those Accents high, And from the Martyrsashes, ere they die, Shall Nemesis her Torch relight! Thus Death, who lays waste all Things, caunot blight The Cause of Truth and Liberty; The Form decays, the Spirit still remains: The Hope of Oldentimes still passes on, Flamelike, from Heart to Heart â the Earth retains Its Lifepower still; so long as sun Shines on it, and the Rain doth wet, It will unweariedly beget All that Industry can ask: Tho', in Desolation's Mask, A wide Waste its Bosom secm, Yet beneath all good Things teem! Thus in the Human Heart as well, As long as Faith and Hope do dwell Within it, good Seeds ever lie, That soon or late must fructify. Spite of Cloud and Storm they'll spring, In their due Season blossoming. Then let us suffer, for to bear Nobly is a Triomph fair, God himself doth calmly wait, Then let Mortals imitate! Do their Duty, let it cost What it will, tho' all be lost, And setting selfish Fears aside, By Wisdom's self be justified. Mankind, like Shadows, pass away, Yet still the mighty Heart for aye Beats on, and every fleeting Year Brings us to the Goal more near, Still it glows with holier Fire, And the pure Ether doth respire, Of Love and wise Humanity, Embracing in its Sympathy Every Form of Being here, Least and greatest, in its Sphere. Thus Truth wins her Victories bright, Not by brute, material Might, But by opening up, more wise, Men's Hearts to all high Sympathies! THE STRANGERSBURIALCORNER. Tread lightly Stranger, for the Brokenheart, In nameless rest, is slumbering 'neath thee here! And tho' the grass be greener than elsewhere, 'Tis rank with cold Forgetfulness, whose smart, Like Adder's sting, seeks out the tenderest part Of the poor breast it wounds â no friendly Tear Has watered this lone grave, nor true Love e'er Strewed its vain Offerings, with simple art Cheating a cureless woe: could that lone grave Find but a voice, how much of Poesy And Pathos it might wake! how many a brave And injured one may here forgotten lie, Seeking in Death from the World's Scorn to save A broken Heart to Immortality! THE BEST MEANS FOR WORKING OUT GREAT BLESSINGS. How would ye work out grand Results, save by The most familiar Means? or how would ye With Profit rouse Men's Hearts to feel and be The Godlike which they are, if not by steadily Subliming, purifying, what is high Within them, by the Aid of all they see And hear? the commoner the better, the 'More certain then will be its Agency, 'Till Repetition to fixed Habit grow: But by the daily Beatings of the Heart, The Hopes which leaven, lighten here below Man's daily Bread? sublime but these, impart To these Religion's allennobling Glow, 'Till, like the common Air we breathe, it flow Thro' his whole Being, leaven into Food Fit for the Angels' Lips his daily Bread, Then commonest Things will most subserve to Good, For in them at all Moments may be read The sublime Lesson thus made present to Men's Minds, in all they think, hope, feel, and do; A daily Warmth within the Heart to keep Its best Affections, Energies, in still And quiet Action, yet intense and deep, Like that upon the Householdhearth, around Which so, so many Blessings meet, to fill Not with intoxicating, but profound Delights the wise Heart which has learnt to bound Itself to that best sphere, which itself can Fill out and perfect â by these Means alone Are great Results to be accomplished â Man Is benefitted, bettered thro 'his own Most daily Thoughts and Feelings only, by His most familiar Impressions; these Once in your Power, you mould him as you please, The Drudge of Earth or Angel for the Sky! The Fool alone wants Means, and hopes by rare And farfetched Methods to work out great Things, Neglecting those, which like the common Air, Abound on all Sides: not so Wisdom brings Her Plans unto Perfection, for she knows That God, who has supplied the meanest Flower, Nay e'en the crawling Earthworm with full Power Its Being to fulfill, has not left those Unfurnished whom he fashioned for the Sky, After his divine Likeness, and that when He gifted Man with Mind and Heart, he gave, Summed up in these, all Goods which he could have; All that was needful in the narrowest Span Of human Life to form Â«the perfect Man!Â» And with what wouldst thou fuse the Hearts of Men Into one godlike mighty Heart, save by The daily Warmth which their own Breasts supply? THE SKYLARK. Sweet Bird, thy Heart within is as thy strain, And from my breast it shakes all withering cares, As the winds do sere leaves, when springtide airs Stir in the trees and wake life's sap again. It seems unnatural to think of Pain When listening to thy music, for it bears No meanings dark, no feverish impulse shares, Echos no idle fears, or hopes as vain. It sounds as blithe as on that primal Day When first thy young wing bore it up the Sky, To the blue depths where Sorrow has no sway, Nor mortal fret intrudes, nor fears to die! Thus in thy perfect innocence Man may Learn a deep lesson of Morality! RELIGION. Religion, thou art rarely seen below Such as pure Faith delights that thou shouldst be: Led by thy Handmaids, meekeyed Charity And patient Love: but in thy Stead we bow To a foul Idol, fashioned from the low And earthly Passions which Men sanctify And worship with thy Name, a gilded Lie, Which yet 'tis Sin to doubt: and Time can show Full-many a Martyr to the ready Hate Of this false Deity, whose Altars reek With frequent Blood of such as dare to seek Salvation their own Way; for 'tis the Fate Of Truth to pass oft for a Lie, so weak, Where Superstition reigns, is her Estate! HOPE. Hope is the only Mistress who repays Us ever with like Love! and tho' it be That she may leave us for awhile, yet we First rudely scare her; in our darkest Days She comes to share our Grief, and soft doth raise The dim Veil from her Brow, and lo! we see The wellknown Features smiling modestly, On which nor Time, nor Pain have left a Trace! And even when Age turns our Hair to gray, And all the World's false Joys forsake us quite, She, still unwearied in her Love, doth stay, And growing ever fairer to our sight, In all her Plenitude of youthful charms Returns a Virgin still unto our Arms; And when on the Gravesbrink the last Embrace She gives, an Angel soars up in her Place! THE FREEMAN. Who is the freeman? â he that in his pride Of heart exalts himself above his kind, And in selfglory's sanctity enshrined, Is his own idol? he whose wishes wide Embrace a universe, yet cannot hide The seeker's poverty! or such as find Their Deity in wealth, or not less blind, In Earth's brief pleasures? Truth will not abide With these vile slaves to fancied Liberty, Whose Circe-cup transforms them into Brutes, Yet leaves no sense of their deformity. True freedom in such Soil as this ne'er roots, But in subduÃ«d Will, Selfmastery, The Empire of the Breast, 'tis there she yields her fruits! ON FAVOURTAKING. Ye think it godlike to refuse a Favour! 'Tis still more godlike to accept it: yea! To meekly bow thy Head, nor turn away E'en from a Beggar's Kiss! for thus the Power Of Good in us is strengthened, and the more From others we receive, the more we may Ourselves bestow, and in all Love display The Gratitude, which, garnered up in our Own inmost Heart, at length will overflow In all kind Actions: 'tis not Virtue to Refuse a favour, 'tis false Pride, e'en so Its baneful Tendrils twine around the true Stem of all virtues: how else can we show And foster Love, save by affording new Occasions unto Gratitude? it grew From Acts of kindness, and begets as due After its kind; but he who will take no Kindness, shuts up its Fount, and none will do. We should receive from others all we may, And do all in our Power to repay Their Love: when not to their ownselves, to those Whom Heaven in our Path on Purpose throws To keep alive Man's Gratitude: would all But do all for each other, and receive All from each other, ready at each call, How lovely would all Hands be joined, the small As able as the greatest, then to weave The web of human Happiness! therein Each least, least Thread of Being right to blend: All, all in Joy and Harmony to spin Together to one high and sublime End: To clothe the Earth with human Blessedness As with a Garment, an enduring Dress Of Beauty, to form which each Thought should tend, The Child's and the Philosopher's, the Maid's And Matron's, for none, none e'er work in vain: Each brings that which the other wants, and aids It to Perfection, 'till the whole shall gain A blended charm, like sunset as it fades! THE MIND'S ALLSELFSUFFICIENCY. What tho' the limbs be fettered, Heaven's light Shut out from the dim Eye? can tyrant's art In its vain mockery inflict a smart Like that he feels within him? can his Might Rob the pure soul of that which renders bright E'en the dim Prison's gloom, an upright heart Where crime and selfdisturbance have no part? It is not so! Faith's glance can put to flight Legions of nether Ill, and in his breast Man can create an Eden where on high And heavenly hopes his wearied Heart may rest, Transforming Time into Eternity! There may he taste true Freedom, still more blest Than those who scorn him, for he scorns them equally! WISDOM. Forth from the Scabbard pluck th'indignant Blade, The best of Umpires since the only one; Lo! Nemesis herself now beckons on, And in her Hand th' avenging Steel is made By Justice, forged in Truth's own Flame to aid Man's Rights against the proud usurping Throne. Hold! hold! a viewless Angel lays upon Thine Arm his Hand as gently to dissuade, And lo! the Sword is shivered like a Reed! List, Mortal, Â«Vengeance is the Lord's,Â» and thy Brute Aid not even here doth Wisdom need In aught, e'en if 'twere possible that by Such means she could attain aught pure or high! In Peace and Love's deep Soil she sows the Seed Of during Blessingsâ and her Watchword is, 'Twixt Man and Man, of Brotherlove a Kiss; And when from Lip to Lip this Token speed, Then will my Form grow clearer to thine Eye, Yea! Mankind will itself become indeed The Angel that now warns the viewlessly, Transformed to that, when from its Errors freed, An Angel of pure Peace and Charity! A MOTHER'S LOVE. O God! how holy is a Mother's Love, How fair, for by an Emphasis of Right It is the Love of Loves: there is no sight In all this dull, cold World, that so may move The Sense of beauty, since by it we prove Our Nature not all selfish; and its Might So deep, selfsacrificing, changeless, bright, Melting into the softness of the dove, Yet blent with more than Man's proud Energy, When peril hovers o'er her young one's nest: She hears not, feels not, fears not, has no Eye Or Heart for aught but this, and deems her blest By her Babe's slightest Glance or greeting Cry, Beyond all Joys that Earth esteemeth best! THOUGHT. Thou art unhappy? yet wherefore I pray? Thou need'st not be so one sole moment more Than thou thyself deem 'st fit; thou hast the Power To think: bring but thy Thoughts beneath thy Sway, And thou wilt have an Empire wide as Day: He who is pinched by his own Thoughts is sore- BestÃ«d indeed, yet all he bears and bore, Will melt like vain Dreams from his Mind away, If one bold Thought into the Magicring But step, where Foolopinion spellbound lies, Like Sprites at Daybreak, all his Whims take wing. He is the worst Slave who from his Mindseyes By Force of Thought the Bandage cannot fling By Fancy bound, that she her Juggleries May thus play off and distort everything. Diseases of the Mind a Thought can heal, As a Thought caused them, and to be a King Of Self, that is to be a King indeed, 'Tis only needful so to think and feel, Thine own Thoughts are the neverfailing Seed Of all real Ill and of thy godliest weal! MOONLITCHURCHYARD. How sweet the Moonlight sleeps upon that Grave! Nor could it find a fitter place of rest, Pouring a flood above its grassy breast Of Heaven's purest light! methinks I have Beheld no lovelier scene. Yon' yewtrees wave With whispering murmurs at the wind's Behest, As if to bless the spot: I scarce breathe, lest A Sound should break the holy calm, where save Myself nought stirs, and yet there's nought of Death. All gloom is scattered by the calm, pure light, E'en as a Mother s soft kiss steals the Breath Of her dreamtroublÃ«d Babe. Oh holy Sight! My heart could almost wish to sleep beneath Yon' grassy turf, it looks so green, and lies so light! PROPORTION. Proportion! 'Tis therein that Wisdom shows Her Mastery; for she can mingle so Conflicting Feelings that from thence shall flow Bliss pure and perfect as an Angel knows! Each passing Day into Life's goblet throws Some fresh Ingredient of Joy or Woe, And yet the whole tastes to her lips as tho' 'Twere Nectar mingled for a God's repose! The Hope of things to be, the Memory Of Past, the Sense of Present, mixed well, make The genuine draught of Immortality: An Elixir far mightier than Medea's To keep us ever young: to cure each ache Of the poor Heart, and turn to smiles its tears! For he who drinks it makes his Being whole, Lives not in Time or Space, but in the Soul, And yielding nothing to the jealous Years, Reaches, ere yet this race be run, the Goal! THE VILLAGEGREEN. 1. Oh I do love to see the Villagegreen On a calm Summersevening, when the glare Of Noon has melted off, and in the air The dewy Star shines forth with modest sheen, To call the peasant home: for rest, I ween, From wholesome toil is sweet, and those who are Compelled to labour for their bread, may share An hour of harmless merriment, which e'en The sated eye of wealth, with all its scorn, Might see with Envy: for there is a spell In pure enjoyment that can ne'er adorn The hollow Joys of Pomp, which seem to tell Of inward barrenness, a Heart all worn, That ne'er has known the bliss of doing well! 2. Alas! such happy scenes are but too rare In our once-merry England: now no more Around the Maypole, as in Days of yore, The Maidens weave their dance, but hollow Care Sits on the poor man's cheek, and on the Air, Instead of merriment, from Town to Tower, A voice of sorrow speaks, and brows do lower That should be clothed with smiles: alas! we are A selfish generation, bowed to Earth Beneath the burthen of our misery, Toilers in Mammon's mine, whose very mirth Is feverish, false, unholy: 'till Faith's high And undiurnal thoughts again have birth, And Charity arise, there is no remedy! SUNSETSCENE. 1. And deem'st thou us, oh God, fit to look on This glorious Vision, worthy of the Eyes Of Angels? yes, for surely Paradise Could show naught fairerâ lo! the Settingsun 'Mid Clouds is sinking, and the Peak of one Vast towering Mass is burning with rich Dies, Like fiery Crater, and o'er all the Skies Its Glow is sent, while ever and anon The Cloudlets floating o'er it melt away In Gold and Purpledropsâ And now 'tis gray, Like an extinct Volcano! silent fade The Fragments of the Pageant to the Lay Of Eveningbirds, as if their Music swayed Its Motions, and interpreted by Aid Of Sound the Eye's still Harmony â lo! Day Dies outâ the glowing Ashes in Nightsshade With Dews are quenched, and all this rich Parade Dissolves in Air, like some vain Dream, for aye! 2. And yet but one brief Moment past' twas there In all its Loveliness, as tho' the Sky Would have preserved it ever, and the Eye Halfdoubting seeks the Place, yet vainly, where The Vision stood: alas! it was too fair To last, too fair for Man's dim Eyes, and by Creative Nature shown thus momently: Ethereal Landscape! too divine to bear Aught save the skywardsoaring Fancy's Tread Or Angel's Footing, but not this dull weight Of earthly cares, which bows each mortal Head! Yet let us gaze, as if Time out of Date It had been, and would still be for us spread: Fill thy Heart with its Blessedness, instead Of mourning the brief Lease allowed by Fate To human Bliss, thus will thy Soul create From perishable Shapes of Joys soon dead That which abidesâ call up the Spirit of Past Bliss, freed from all Earthliness, above The reach of Change, a perfect Angel led By Faith and Fancy for the Form that's fled! TO NAPOLEON. Napoleon! thou art a lasting Brand And Stigma on man's name: his destinies Were at thy bidding, yet thou couldst despise The godlike power to bless, redeem: thy hand Was on the golden key of that fair land, The land of promise, and the nations' eyes Were strained to see their Morningstar arise On Time's horizon: but with Magicwand Ambition touched thee, and thy features grew Into the likeness of a Fiend: thus all The hopes of worlds betrayed, like leaves that strew The Earth unseasonably, fade and pall! But from their dust shall spring a harvest true, Of selfderivÃ«d hopes: their Trust, thy glory's Fall! FOREIGN CATHEDRALTHOUGHTS. O God! amid this timehued pile, by thee And thoughts of thee made holy, let me bow And ask thy blessing: tho' it be not now For worship that I enter, yet to see Aught that awakes the faintest memory Of what thou art, effaces every low And earthward Thought, and stirs the inward flow Of feelings that but slept awhile, to be But stronger at their waking: and tho' here, Not with the words that from my Mother's tongue I learnt to offer thee, thy praise be sung: And tho' the forms be not such as I hear In my own Fatherland, yet still among Thy servants it is sweet to pray, and feel thee near! POVERTY. Poor Man, seest thou not that the scant, coarse Bread Whereon thou liv'st is Manna from the Sky, That the unyielding, stern Necessity Whose grudging Hand has hardly furnishÃ«d The food by which thy little ones are fed, Is but a disguised Angel? verily It is so! wilt thou see it with Faith's Eye, Thy scanty board shall seem a table spread For Angels' Visiting: yea, they are there, As surely as thyself and Children! lo! Thou wantest nothing: nay, thou hast to spare, A Breadcrust to the Beggar who may go Past thy poor Door, a Kiss of Love to show Thy Gratitude to God, who sent him where Two Mouths may be by one same morsel fed, For where Love is the Table's richly spread! ASPIRATIONS AFTER THE IMPOSSIBLE. 1. Vain Aspirations, that on faltering wing Uplift your rash and heavenscaling flight Into that Air where none may breathe: such height But preludes deeper downfall: ye can bring Back unto Earth and to Earth's puny King No vaster Bliss than suits his bounded Might And frail Capacity: the heavenslight Is not for these frail mortal Eyes! each thing Is perfect in itself and boasts its own Particular charm, each moment bears upon Its wings some shape of bliss, and ere 'tis flown, Be wise and pluck, or else the Rosebloom's gone, And Dis sappointment's barren thorn alone Remains, to sting the Heart, when Â«All is knownÂ»! 2. What is to live? to live each moment's space, With these to build up thine Eternity, For still 'tis made of moments: as they fly To hive their honey: not in the vain chace Of coming pleasures' fancygilded race, Mere sunbeammotes, to let the present die And wither on Time's stalk unplucked. Oh why Are we not Children still? why from the face Of Nature do we turn away or gaze With sated eyes, why do we Live no more Unto the moment's bliss, as in the Days Of Childhood, when Life's seasonable flower We gathered and were blest, and in its Place Sprang new ones, seeds of that plucked just before! 3. Alas! what is it in this world that makes True happiness a name, an airbuilt dream? O'erbusy in the search, on life's dark stream, Chained to Hope's oar, we toil and toil, 'till breaks The last wave on Time's wreckstrewn shore, and wakes Us with its Shock to catch the flickering gleam Of Hope's expiring torch, the spectral Beam That lights us to the Grave: while o'er life's wrecks The thundering surge of dark Eternity Breaks like the wave o'er bubbles! Oh! awake, Seek not to grasp the Future lest it fly E'en as a shadow from thy clutch, a snake Which in our Bosoms cherished, long will lie; With the Heartsblood at length its thirst to slake! NECESSARY LINKING OF GOOD WITH GOD. One Angel brings another, one good Thought Another! as when in the Spring we see One flower we know that all the rest will be Soon there in sweetest fellowship, as brought Forth by one breath of Love, and as is wrought The Beauty of the Spring by these, so we Feel all of Heaven drawing silently Around us, when our Souls a ray have caught Of one high Fancy: like a smile sent down From Angel's Face, soft in the Ether clear Melting away, 'twixt two white cloudlets shown: So distant, yet to Fancy so, so near, That we stretch forth our hands, and lo! anon Are floating with him thro' his own blest sphere! PRAYER. How glorious the Anthem peals on high, Fit music for th' eternal God, and wakes Thoughts not of Time, as up the roof it breaks In wavelike Harmonies: yet sweeter I Still deem the fervent voice that seeks the Sky In halfbreathed whispers: this from Heaven takes By sweet compulsion what it asks, yet makes No vain Display of Speech, as if God's Eye And Ear were dull as Man's! what tho' the voice Breathe not my native accents? yet the name Of God is sweet in every tongue, the same In every clime, and hearing we rejoice. All Prayer is welcome to him, if free choice Prompt it, if his good pleasure be the aim! ON GHIBERTI'S GATES TO THE BAPTISTERY AT FLOBENCE. Worthy to be the Gates of Paradise! To be? they are! for he who enters here With pure Heart and with Conscience free and clear, Dead to the World and all its Vanities, Which now without those doors forgotten lies, Hath entered into Heaven! for his Ear The mortal voices hymning faintly near Are turned to swelling Angelharmonies, And as he kneels, no Image of vain Stone Bends mutely, but the Saviour's self instead, Consoling and exalting! lo! all's gone! Walls, Altar, Dome, all, all has vanishÃ«d, The Outward, Visible, which was alone As the Foretemple, like a Dream, hath fled, And the eternal Soul alone abides, Its own best Temple, vast, unlimited, Where we adore the Spirit which resides Within, no Semblance, but the true Godhead! THE CHURCHYARD. It was an Eve of Summer's gentlest mood, And the slope sun smiled o'er with lingering ray An old Churchyard that in a green nook lay Far from all stir of worldliness. I stood Wrapt in its holy beauty, for a flood Of golden Light on the cold graves did play, And they were cold no more, but seemed to say, Â«We are not that ye deem us, to the good, The grave is peace, and life, and liberty.Â» And my Heart answered Â«yes:Â» wherefore I know Not, but that Â«yesÂ» was echoed by a sigh! Haply 'tmight be that tho' the soul thus glow At thoughts of life eternal, yet to die In the frail flesh wakes still some shuddering throe! OCCASIONS OF GREATNESS. The great Soul needs no opportunities To show its Greatness, it creates them: takes Earth's commonest Materials, and makes The Poesy of Life from them to rise Pure as the Muse's fountain; that which lies Before thee, 'tis therein that Wisdom wakes The soul of Good oft dormant, 'till it breaks Forth like the Flame whose unspent Energies Lurk in the Embers, which the careless eye Perceives not! thus by divine Sympathy One Soul awakes another seemingdead. Thine own Heart can impart a Value high To things most mean, by thousand Channels spread The noblest Blood of its best Artery! PRAYER. O God! from whom all holy Blessings are, And chiefly those Chiefblessings, a pure heart And humble, grant that I may set apart My Soul, a shrine to thee: that as the air Receives the Light, so may my spirit share The light of Truth: grant me in every part Of manyfeatured life that better Art, To love myself in thee, aright to bear Its seeming Ills: for these too, like the Bee, Have Sting and Honey, as we bear them we Taste this or that! so shall the Thought of Thee Attune my Heart, tho' fallen on evil days, Like the keynote of some high minstrelsy That runs thro' all the strains: and when thy ways Seem dark and intricate, oh let me be Led by that better light which ne'er betrays! SORROW. Oh Sorrow, holy Sorrow, thou hast shown Me thy whole Face, and lifted quite thy Veil, And tho' thy Features may be somewhat pale, Yet Beauty like to thine I ne'er have known! Oft with a secret Trembling have I flown From thy veiled Presence, but now thy least Tale Or passing Sound of Voice can never fail To stay my Steps and tune them to thine own! The noblest Things are deepestâ not upon The surface found, but like the Pearl, below, And oft uncouth in semblance; they alone Whom thou hast sobered but not saddened, know That e'en to thy pale Forehead may be own Such Smiles as o'erflushed Joy could never show! Nor are thy Tears all bitter ones: oh no! But these alone are left thee to express, Yet how imperfectly, thy Consciousness Of the Unspeakable, which in thy woe Revealed itself first to thee, still and deep, Like to some solemn Vision in sweet Sleep: An opening up into Eternity When hoped for least, a full Glance from the Eye Of God himself, a Recognition clear, When like to Moses in the fiery Bush He stood revealed in all his Majesty, For purified by Grief, thou thyself wert No longer earthly: the diviner Part Had triomphed, and in that thy God drew near, The primal Likeness stamped within thine Heart In its old Glory did again appear; But of the Godlike which filled thee, a Tear Of Wonder only to thine Eye could start! The Noblest, Godliest, we cant express But only be: its sublime Consciousness Imprints itself on all we think and do, Its only Utterance a whole Life thro'! Like the Earth's Centrewarmth it works unseen, Save in the countless Blessings which have been Caused by it, in the Flowers and Fruits with which It makes her else bare Surface so, so rich! FANCY. Oh Fancy, what sweet offices, what bright And holy missions hast thou! 'tis thy power That lights the damp and darkling dungeon's floor As with a Heavenray, and by that light The sad and sinking Prisoner calls to sight The fresh, green Fields and Hills he wandered o'er In happy boyhood, and the home no more His Eyes shall look on; and in Fancy's Might His clanking Chains fall off, his Heart is free, Far 'bove the petty Spite and baffled Hate Of his oppressors, and all memory Of what he is, snatching from bitter fate An hour of rapture: e'en the outward Eye Sublimed, the Spirit helping to create! THE BURIAL. I've stood upon the dark and fearful Brink Of the deep Grave, and heard the cold earth fall Crumbling, above the breast of what was all We love, revereâ oh how it makes one shrink, That dust! it seems to break the last fond Link With which hope cheats the heart, and tho' so small, Yet 'tis the last of those that still may call Up thoughts not quite despair: howe'er hope think, There is in that sad sound I know not what Of agony, that like an icy grasp, Clutches the struggling heart and to the spot Forces the Eyes, like Stone: 'till the Breast gasp For the poor boon of life: 'tis a dread Lot To see our loved ones thus, and think that they are not! TRUE STRENGTH WHAT? LATIMER. 1. Behold yon' oldman bound unto the stake, His gray Locks stirrÃ«d by the wind, and bare His sacred body to the flames which are Unwilling Instruments, and for his sake Lose all their terrors: know ye whom ye make To suffer, whom ye with the Martyr there Have bound, his pangs and triomph high to share? Who is it that the oldman's form doth take? 'Tis Christ himself! yea! for himself hath said, That whatsoe'er of Good or Ill ye do To the least of his flock, that it unto Him, as if present there, is offerÃ«d; Since all the Faithful form in Union true One Man with Christ, for that high End he bled! 2. Chains are not srength, nor armÃ«d hosts! see there, Ye blind Tools in Godshand, who do not know From whence ye come, or whither 'tis ye go, Or what ye labour at! he who can bear The cross of Christ, yet faint not, nor despair, Is mighty, yea! as Christ, and shall lay low With nothing but the Cross each earthly foe; For he is no more single: Legions are Embattled 'neath the Standard which he shows, Whose power can enlist not sword or spear, But Thoughts and Hearts of Men, which he who knows To win atchieves a Victory bright and clear; The Heart which his one Bosom doth enclose Is many Hearts in one, yea! all Hearts here! EARTHSWISDOM. Amid the Leaves, yon wingÃ«dGem of air, The firefly, sparkles, with his paley light, Shedding a halo faint, that to the sight Scarce makes him visible, as if he were A Miser hoarding his frail lamp with care. Methinks in this poor insect, read aright, An emblem of that selfish prudence might Be found, which 'mong the Sons of Men doth bear The name of Wisdom, tho' it scarcely throw Light on the narrow circle of its own Moletrack: oft wanting found e'en in the low And grovelling paths of earthly Gain alone. True Wisdom, like the Star above me now, With catholic and alldiffusÃ«d light doth glow! PRAYER. 1. Wilt thou not send an angel from his Sphere To stand beside me, and inspire my Song, To urge it like a Prophet's soul along; God let it be so, let him fill mine Ear With accents like to those, to which when near Thy throne, one of the everquiring throng, He strikes his divine harp! yet I do wrong Thy Goodness much: for do we not all hear Far more than an Archangelsvoice? yea! thy Own voice, within us, in its own calm wise Filling us, like a gentle Breath, and by The Soul's deep Language deigning to reply, To comfort and console, when fears arise, Best Oracle! which in our own heart lies! All Prayers conducive really to our Good God grants, and willingly: yet not always In the same sense we ask, nor in the days When most we hope them, nor by means we should Have looked for; all things are but as the mood In which we take them; Blessings have no place Within a Heart devoid of divine Grace, E'en tho' they were the choicest Heaven could Bestow on man. Oft in our bitterest woe, When least we think our prayers are heard, they are Already registered above â and lo! Like the Moon under Clouds, Light from afar The soul receives, which silently doth grow, 'Till its full Brightness clouds no more can bar! VENICE. 1. Fair Venice! scarce less fair than in the pride Of better Days, when glory's golden Wing Fanned thy victorious Waves, and Earth would ring With thy most high exploits, for still abide The relics of the Past: Time cannot hide All traces of thy Majesty, nor bring Such memories low; and tho' a forlorn Thing, Yet hast thou tenfold Might to stir the Tide Of holiest sympathies: oh it would need A Heart of stone to see thee and not weep, Thus sinking 'neath harsh Desolation's tread, A dim Sunset into old Adria's Deep, Whence thou erst rose, a Dayspring on the Sleep Of Worlds benighted, Heroes, Commerce, Arts to breed! 2. Yes, thou didst spring a fair and goodly Tree, Of many Centuries' growth, and 'neath thy shade The Nations sat; yet have we seen thee fade With scarce enough of life and memory To mourn the thing thou art! and on Alluding to the touching Mementos on the Palacewalls, such as Â«verrÃ  il Giorno:Â» Â«non Nobis.Â» etc. thy high And haughty dwellings patriotgrief has made His sad memorials, in wrath has bade The dumb Walls curse the Tyrant! it doth weigh Like some misshapen Dream upon the Mind, Too huge for Grasping, and we turn away From the dim Vision of our Thought, and try In mere Reality Relief to find, But lo! it rises sadder on the Eye, And stands before us, Fact and Phantasy! 3. And when we have o'erpassed the narrow Space Of Waters, which that City round Embrace, And sever in real Fact unto our Sight, As to our Fancy it stands severed quite From common Things, unique in Time and Place, It seems not as if we had passed alone Those few Miles, but as if a Gulf were thrown Betwixt us and the Worldâ yea, it doth seem As if from real Life into some strange Dream We had just stepp'd: as if the Present were Forgot, and in its Place the Past stood there: We lose all Consciousness of Self, and as Spectres ourselves, 'mid Spectres onward pass, Like our own Shadows: real Existence seems Something we cannot grasp, a Life of Dreams! ON SELFSEEKINGNESS. 1. Care not thou merely for what is thine own: Thine own House, Children, Fortune, Family, Nor even thine own Land alone: for by So doing thou wilt lessen, tho' unknown To thee, that which thou cherishest alone; Thy little Stream of kindly Acts, of highâ -Er, nobler Thoughts and Cares, tho' seemingly In the vast Ocean ever rolling on Of human Affairs lost, will yet someday Be in sweet Dews repay'd to the Springhead, Which without these were dry: altho' it may Seem as the Source were in thyself, 'tis fed By means to which thou hast contributed But little; from the years long fled away 2. Before the Flood, from such far Sources flow The daily Blessings which make Life so dear: How much hast thou contributed to rear True Freedom's holy temple, in which now Thou worshipest, and liv'st, and breath'st, as tho' It had been ever thus; and yet whose were The Hands that lay'd the Cornerstone? which ne'er Had been thus firmlyfixed had all thought so As thou dost: labour then for others' Good, 'Tis but a surer Mode to reach thine own; Of Man's high Heritage how little would Fall to thy Share, hadst thou that part alone Which thou thyself hast added; everyone Is with the wealth of all Mankind endowed! 3. Do all for all Men! let not one pass by Thy Door unaided: and if thou hast naught Besides to give, give that which all men ought And can, a Debt due to Humanity; For none should be so poor as to deny A Kiss of Love, a Blessing, which have wrought Oft far, far greater Good, than those have thought Who gave them: for the truest charity Is that of Heart to Heart! let thy Soul blend With others, as Star blends with Star to light The Heavens; not 'till all men's minds unite Can Life's great Blessings mingle to one End. Beat but the universal Heart aright And to thine also Health and Strength 'twill lend, For is not thine a pulse of it, a Vein That bears the Lifeblood to it, and again Receives it thence, more noble and more pure By this Commingling for the common Good? But if each Vein no longer bear its Blood To the great Heart, Disease beyond all cure Will seize on it, and these must perish too With that from whence their Nourishment they drew! ON WESTMINSTERABBEY. [1.] In this vast pile, amid the mighty Dead, Eight centuries of Glory, I have caught An inspiration from their tombs. I've thought On the old Days, when, in the organ's stead That dies in feeble echos o'er my Head, The mighty voice of an whole people sought The presence of its God, and upward wrought As it would rend the roof: and as I tread, Methinks the spirit of old times doth wave His dusky wings above my pensive brow, And like a solemn voice from out the Grave Thrills coldly at my Ear, Â«Time, Time lays low The mighty from their seats: spares nought: nought, save Worth's memory, and what thou look'st on now! 2. This pile was built when Faith sprang from on high And still worked Miracles, in Days of yore When warm Enthusiasm's fullest power Swayed the untutored Heart, and men would die For their forefathers' creed devotedly: The growth of Centuries, and by the dower Of many generations built, not poor In works of Faith, that to Eternity Witness Religion's Might; but this old Creed Has passed away, and left its Dwellingplace, Rich in such spoils as Time cannot efface, But hallows more by memories which feed Thoughts not of earthly hue, to a new Race Of Worshippers, who o'er their ancient Foes here tread! [3.] Here 'mid this timeworn Aisle, so dim and gray, On which eighthundred years do brood, I stand In all man's nothingness: on either hand The Dust of Ages crumbling slow away, Relics of things and creeds that in their Day Could stir Men's Hearts like Earthquakes; who has scanned Such Scenes unmoved, where Time but waves his wand And Centuries vanish, like a Dream, for aye! And all their Might and empty Pageantry, Their cherished hopes, their passions and their pride, Leave but a few faint signs the curious Eye Scarce traces on the walls, which still abide, Tho' Generations pass, to teach a high, Sad Truth, Â«Earth's hopes are dust and VanityÂ»! THE BROOK. How fresh yon brook flows murmuring along, Making sweet music to the distant ear Of the wayworn and feverish traveller. And tho' its Windings' scape the Eye, its Song That warbles, birdlike, the bright Flowers among And roundembosoming Trees, as he draws near, Like to a gladsome Wellcome fresh and clear, Comes waking in his pensive Breast a throng Of happy recollections. Nature aye, So Selfdisturbance banish not her sway, Can offer consolation and a balm To the bruised Heart: methinks I hear her say Â«Come rest thee weary one: amid this calm Take thyjust share of bliss, of thoughts that know no harm! ON ESTEEMING THE ETERNAL ONLY. Hast thou e'er asked thyself if it can be Wise to lay much Stress upon Things which are But accidental, which scarce reach so far As the mere outward Attributes which we Attach unto them? learn thou then to see With the Immortal's Eyes: live as a Star 'Mong Stars, which strive not about Place, nor war For Precedence, too busy with what the Great God created them to be and do! And oh! how happy were it for Men too Would they but do the same! each occupied With being simply Â«Man,Â» each helping true His Brethren: all Distinctions set aside Which serve Man's inborn Dignity to hide: Each seeming in his Fellow's Eyes, as to God's own, an Equal: neither great nor small, But Children of the one great Father all! And surely then that Man is little wise Who makes Distinctions which God's self denies! THE NIGHTINGALE. Awake my soul, for 'tis the selfsame Song That in the pure days of thine Infancy Called forth the love of Nature with its high And thrilling accents: can that voice belong To a mere Bird? or is my fancy wrong When I would deem some spirit wanders nigh, Giving a Tongue to thoughts that hidden lie, Like dewdrops, in the flowers! 'tis a Mirth So deep, so holy that it can have birth But in a Breast where Love has harboured long: Methinks all pleasures mingle with that sound, That Fancy dreams, or on this Earth are found! Could I, glad Bird, but learn thy holy Lore And sing like thee, my now harsh Voice should beat All strains of minstrelsy, should charm and cheat Men's Ear's, 'till their dull Hearts grew true once more! ON LOWAIMED PEOPLE. Meansoul'd! to talk thus of a Familyname; Can such an object fill the ample Eye Of Wisdom, or of pure Humanity? Can Life's wide Sphere afford no worthier Aim? Canst thou not make thy Heart one and the same With that calm, mighty Heart, full of all high And holy Things, which beats eternally In Nature's Bosom? then will a pure Flame Burn up upon thy household Hearth, as 'twere An Altar of Humanity, and so It would be; but if thou wilt take no Share In what concerns Mankind, then art thou no Member thereof, a Branch that will not bear, To which no Sap from the great Heart can flow, And which enjoys not its own Life too, for The Part lives by the Whole, such Nature's sublime Law! EFFECT OF EVENINGSTILLNESS. O God, my heart is stirred with secret prayer, And in my eye the tears of gratitude Stand soft as dewdrops, for in solitude, This silence, where each blade and leaf doth share A sense of thee, and everything is fair And taintless as a Babe's first thoughts, the mood Of Man's proud Spirit melts towards thee, Allgood, Allbounteous Deity: we seem to hear Thy voice as in the mystic Days of yore, When Man held commune with his Maker and Received his blessing: still thy Works are grand And fresh as on the primal Day when o'er The Heavens and Earth thou look'dst, and with thy Hand Didst motion Sun and Moon, and Chaos was no more! TRUE POSSESSIONTAKING. What we think we possess that truly we Possess by thinking so, tho' otherwise, Tho' really out of Reach the Treasure lies: While what we think we have not, that can be Never enjoyed, nor truly ours, tho' the Sound titledeed in every Point defies The quibbling Lawyer's flawdetecting Eyes. To think a Thing is making it so.âhe Who thinks that God is in him, will live so As if God were, will live godlike in Deed And Thought, and then most truly God will grow A Part of him, his Spirit! and will lead Him on to Spiritwealth, untill of low And perishable Goods he feels no need. What we believe is realized, at least To us, and what more would a man request? Believe thyself then capable of all That's great and godlike, and deem nothing small, The Little only Littleness can see. Yea, think that like God himself thou mayst be, And then thou wilt become so: think but this With thy whole Heart and Soul. and give it Act, Then with each Day thou'lt grow more so in Fact, For thy sublime Belief is also His! THE GRAVE. Descend with me into the Grave, and there Gather what Time has left: look back upon The giddy World, and think when all is won That boundless Folly covets, still the Care, The Fret, the Toil of years, unerring bear To this poor Goal: here sets false Glory's Sun, Weath's Glitter fades, and Pleasure's Course is run! What wouldst thou bring with thee? Earth's seemingfair Yet hollow Gauds, or with more sober Eye, The healing Conscience, that plucks out the thorns From an unquiet Deathbed? of Eternity This is the narrow Pass, and here must die All that is not eternal: Truth still warns From the Grave's Dust, but man her Counsel scorns! TIMESGLASS. 1 Maiden with the sunny Brow, And the starry Eye of blue, Tell me truly dost thou know Who it is that stands by you? 2 When these charms of Form and Face Withered all like Mayblooms lie, Hast thou to supply their place Treasures laid up for the sky? 3 Hast thou higher Beauty which Time and sere Decay touch not, That can make thee truly rich Tho' stern Want should be thy lot? 4 As the Years pass o'er thy Brow, And imprint their Wrinkles there, In the deep Heart far below Seek thou that which shall not wear. 5 Thou that like a fragile Flower Seem'st but destined for the Sun, Know that by the passing hour The future web of Life is spun. 6 If then it be wove awry, It will give thee pain and care, Toil and trouble to untie The knots which Folly's hand made there! 7 Thus spake an old, old, grayhaired Man With something of solemnity, Yet an halfsmile, if close you'd scan, Lurked in his shrewd, grey, twinkling Eye. 8 Then held he up unto her face A glass which in his hand he bore, And said, Â«what do'st thou, Maiden, trace, Saw'st thou e'er the like before? 9 She gazed into the glass with pride, Her cheek was flushed, her Eye did beam, She pushed the old Man's hand aside Halfpettish! yet wellpleased did seem. 10 He held up next an hourglass, And said, Â«these little grains which sink Thus noiselessly, will bring to pass Strange things that neither of us think, 11 And they will make us too, I hope, Betteracquainted than just now, Tho' paltry seems their scanty scope, They do much, for no rest they know. 12 Make sure of them, they show like Sand, But they are worth far more than Gold, Oh! let them not slip thro' thy Hand: Their full worth thou wilt know when old! 13 Tho' small their Size, they make the Day, Yea! and the bulk of each big Year, And if you cast them once away They leave an awkward Gap I fear. 14 The Maiden at the Hourglass Look'd not, but in the Mirror took Another peep ere he did pass Away, and his grey Head he shook. 15 Years had rolled on, and once again The oldman by the Maiden stood, He found her, as he left her, vain, Â«Tomorrow and TomorrowÂ» was her mood! 16 He showed her in the glass that face Which Time had altered visibly, Yet still retained the former grace, Which pleased the undiscerning Eye. 17 Complacently she looked on it, Yet many Tokens pained her there, And chagrined, half her lip she bit, Then turned about with angry Air, 18 Begone, old Dotard! who are you? I know you not, your toil is vain: Side he, Â«my duty I but do, I leave you, but to call again! 19 That you do know me not is clear, The more the Pity 'tis for you, For they who learn to know me here Too late, their fault are sure to rue. 20 The years flew on, and pityless They furrowed over that smooth brow, And hateful grey mixed with each tress, Yet left the heart unchanged below. 21 The Hive was empty, and its bees, Wing'd moments, who should fill the cells, Were few, and Autumn's breath did freeze The flowers where the best Juice swells. 22 Again by her he took his stand, He showed his glass, she turned away, Then shattered with an angry hand The too true Image of decay. 23 He showed the hourglass once more, The grains were running very low, Â«Take heed, before thy soul to God With these dread Witnesses shall go, 24 They are unbribeableÂ», he said, Then left her on his words to muse, But Truth, when Vanity's not dead, Can Folly's eyes scarce disabuse. 25 Fix'd habit still the sceptre grasps, And passions their old nurture crave, And Age's skinny hand unclasps Its bauble only in the grave. 26 Once more he stood beside her; on A sickbed pale and worn she lay, Â«Dost thou now know the erst unknown,Â» He said, the worms demand this clay, 27 And Heaven thy soul, such as it is!Â» She gave a look of shuddering fear, Art thou not Time? oh God! in this Moment with Death I feel thee here! 28 But a short while ago I was Time limited and brief, said He, But onward now with thee I pass, Not Time, but all Eternity! 29 And just as these words reached her ear, The last sandgrain of all had run, Earth claims that which remaineth here, For this, said He, she lived alone! 30 Mortals take heed, this tale is ours, And while we criticize and laugh, Look to it, lest these same swift hours Winnow not grain, but empty chaff. PATRIOTISM. Truth's Martyrs ne'er by Tyranny are crush'd, They have a thousand Lives; tho' baffled Hate Scatter their Ashes, 'tis but to create From every Particle of hallowed Dust A Spark of Truth, that dies not out, but must Or soon or late blaze up; few Years may date Their bright Career, or Guilt anticipate: 'Tis but to make them of all Time, a Trust And Pledge to Worlds betray'd: the Light That burns within them is of Heaven's best, And may not be extinguished, tho' the Might Of Hell be leagued its Lightnings to arrest; It passes harmless o'er truetempered Sight, Scathing the Tyrant on his Throne, 'till Earth have Rest! Henceforth, a spiritual Presence o'er The Earth they watchâa thousand Forms they take, Live in a thousand Hearts, not as before In one: 'till multiplying more and more, The Universal Heart in each awake And each in it, for Parts the Whole still make! And then again they live in one Heart, as Before, for Mankind's Heart grows what theirs was; Thus in their single Breast the Hearts of all they bore! INTOLERANCE. He who would chain the Eaglewing of Mind Within the narrow Circle of his own Particular Creed, alas! cannot be one Of those who love the Truth: yet such we find: Nor wanting those that with base Shackles bind Her nobler Votaries, who labour on With Martyrcourage, 'till the Goal be won: With Martyrreverence and Zeal ne'er blind, That will not take a Lie, nor accept aught Of Man's Inventions, for her divine Light. It is a Task with Peril ever fraught To take it from the Bushel, where from Sight The Cunning-ones of Earth have hid it, taught That Men cannot be Slaves and see aright! TO FREEDOM. Hail Freedom! Springhead of each choicest Good, Flowing from Heaven's depths, the more that share Thy Draughts the fuller is the Fount. Lifeair, By which alone we live, and are renewed! 'Tis thy strong Beating spreads the healthy Blood Thro' th' Universal Heart, whose Pulses were Else dull and stagnate, and of all Things fair To thee are due the Firstfruits, next to God! How glorious, methinks, thy Name to hear In the calm Whisper of tenmillion low, Accordant Voicesâ. like the Ocean, so Mankind, when joined in one, has nought to fear: Each then is what the Whole is! and when one Is injured, it is all Humanity That's injured in himâthus is each kept by The Whole inviolate as itselfânone Are little, but all godlike as the Whole, All free, like Drops that with the Ocean roll! Thus too each Soul is safe in the great Soul, And injuring it, you injure the Mosthigh, Who will remember it accordingly! There is I know not what in such a Sight Of Majesty, when private Hope and Hate Mix not therewith its Grandeur to abate; When in the sole Conviction of Man's Right A Nation lifts its Voice, and in the Might, The fearless Consciousness of Truth, elate Yet sober, while just Means most fitly mate With holiest Ends, goes forth unto the Fight! A Triomph too not stained with Blood nor wrought By Violence, that mars the Good it sought: But thro' the noblest Feelings of Mankind, Resistlessly, as in one Heart combined! And when that Heart has but the Feeling true Of its ownself, and what it's destined to, No greater Good will it then seek or find! For if it thinks and feels godlike and free Within itself, where can it truly be So much so, and thenceforth what chains can bind? Thoughts are the only Fetters for the Mind! CONTENT. Poor Fool! to look with Envy at a King! Saw'st thou how quick the Temples throb below That jewelled Bauble glittering on his Brow, Couldst thou but feel how many curses cling To that false Pomp, its Brightness withering: Or look beneath vain Semblances, and know Within that narrow Space how much of Woe, Guilt, Shame, and Fear, are ever ministring Their slow, sure Poison to the restless Heart: Oh! thou wouldst turn away in Selfdisgust, To think that hollow Splendor can impart To a poor Worm, made, like thyself, of Dust, Such Sway, that Men, slaved by the baser Part, Unto their Eyes, their Judgments thus entrust! EARTHSBENEFACTORS. Toil on, ye godlike Spirits, toil: plough ye The Furrow, and therein the good Seed sow, Truth's divine Seed! but seek not here below Remuneration: for the more ye be Like Christ, so much the more ungratefully Shall ye be treated! for ye shall rise no Statue or Column, Festival or Show, To cherish in Men's Hearts your Memory: But like the Echo of a most vain Thing, Your Names shall pass away without a Trace: 'Till the true Crop, in due Time ripening, Shall vindicate for you a higher Place In Glory's Shrine, than Conqueron or King, Whose Trophies Worms and Dust shall soon efface! LIFE. And what is Life?âa Child among the Flowers: A Kiss: the Loosing of a Maiden's Zone, The Lifting of the Veil by Fancy thrown Around her Form, and then the bitter Hours, The Heritage of those who use her Powers Unwisely; 'tis the Sickman's feeble Moan: A Mother's Joy: an evervarying Tone, A passing Shadow: Sumbeams amid Showers. It is all this, but it is something more! It is a Striving towards all Goodâa wise And steady Application of that Lore, Wherein all Happiness and Wisdom lies, By which we draw forth from Afflictions sore That Evenmindedness, Life's noblest Plize! BEINGSRIDDLE. We leave this World as strangely as we came Into it, without learning why or how: The Riddle still remains unsolved, we know At last, nor more nor less, but just the same As at the firstâ'tis as if Nature's Aim Had been to wrap in Mystery, which no Thought e'er can penetrate, the Source whence flow The thousand Streams of Being: should I name One who might loose the Knot, it likeliest were The newborn Child, who but just now was there 'Mid the great Spirits all, before the Throne Of God; yet were he able back to stare, Impenetrable Gloom would meet alone His Glance, and Witness save the Soul is none! NIGHTTHOUGHT. Oft from the Closing of the Flower 'till The Opening thereof, ye Stars, have I Watched ye move onwards thus, thus silently, And my Soul spake â Â«how meekly they fulfill Their so unspeakably grand Task: how still They burn, with Fire soft as in Love's Eye: And each, as he sinks downward from the Sky, Shines on the same â!Â» Oh might they but instill In me the Spirit which impels them, how, How blessed would Man's Being then appear! No Strife, no Vanity, no Doubt to throw Upon his Path a Shadow or a Fear, But being calm itself, all Things would grow Like to the Soul, by its own Light made clear! 'Till this so troubled Scene of Earth should seem As lovely as those Stars which o'er me gleam! IDOLATRY. There are far worse Idolaters than those Who bow down to vain Images of Stone Or Metal: Men, whose Hearts have never known One generous Thought! who worships falsely, shows At least that still the Fount of Feeling flows Within him. but directed ill alone: But to these, God or Devil, 'tis all one: Naught, naught is holyâso they but hold close The one great Idol, Â«SelfÂ», in their Embrace! These are the worst Idolaters, Men who Their Maker's Image wantonly deface, Who laugh at all high Thinking, at all true And noble Feeling, as quite out of Place In Weekdaylife, as having naught to do Therewith: Proofs of mere Simpleness, and to Romancers' Dreams akin! as if there could Be any Field so fit for all that's good And godlike as Man's daily Sphere! the Space His most familiar Affections should Comprize! 'tis here the great Mind gains that Mood Of sublime Wisdom, teaching it to brace The Sinews of its Industry, to see Nothing as mean or little, tho' it be To break Stones by the Roadside: but all good Alike to help us to unfold the Soul Within us â to become Â«quite MenÂ»! to this High Purpose making Good and Ill subserve, Nay! making them indifferent! such is Her divine Priviledge, her highest Goal! Enough, if in all Stations he preserve The Man, and what he wants, at least deserve: And then he will want Nothing! for when he Has himself worthy of the Blessings made, Then they, like Angels, will be near to aid, Nay! flowing from himself unfailingly! LOVE. Love is the Leaven of Life's daily Bread, Without which it will nourish not; and oh! Without, how salt is its best Fare! more so Than the hard Crust on which the Beggar's fed, If with one kind Word seasoned: Love can spread A Banquet worthy of the Angelsâtho' The Fare seem coarse and scant, it is not: no! But so, so sweet that nothing in its Stead Could nourish half so much, for it doth make Content: no Man is poor who loves indeed! The scanty Bread which he doth daily break, By Miracle like that whereof we read, Is multiplied, and made too, for his sake, More than sufficient for Life's every Need! Would'st thou be rich, most rich? then love, love, love: Love all, and thou'lt be rich as He above, Who loving all lefore himself, is the Great Focus of eternal Love, from whence Each Ray that fosters this cold Earth must be Derived, and to which it returns from hence! MARTYRS. Oh! there are other Martyrdoms than those Of Rack, and Stake, and Fire! some are by Their own Hearts martyred, and the Poesy, Whose Perfume far excels the sweetest Rose, Is wrung from out them, like the Sweat which flows From the pale, throbbing Brow of Agony! On the high Altar of Humanity, Like costly Incense, the true Poet throws His Heart, and there in its own holy Fire Is it consumed: yet still the pure Desire At which the Flame was kindled, that remains, But more sublimed by all its Griefs and Pains, And when in Ashes that Heart shall expire, Consumed therewith, fresh Force thereby it The Desire. gains, And like pure Gold, still its first Worth retains, Reducing all, of Origin no higher Than Earth, to Dust, when into Contact brought With it, the Lightning of eternal Thought! THE UNUTTERABLE. 1. Hast thou remarked the purpleclustered Vine In Autumn, thus so meekly, silently, With its rich Fruitage thanking thee for thy Long Care of it? and is there naught divine In this its Silence? speaks it not to thine Own Heart? and if it had a Voice, whereby To tell its Gratitude, could it reply More godlike or intelligibly? shine Not too the Stars with stillymodest Rays, The Good they do their only Hymn of Praise? And when thou pluck'st the ripe Grapes, does it ask One least, least Recompense? it only lays Aside its Treasures, meekly to its Task Gathers its Strength within, and 'neath the Mask Of deathlike Winter, 'till the coming Spring Shall bid its Blossoms in the Sunshine bask, Fulfills its godlike End unmurmuring! 2. And thou, oh Man! wilt thou not act likewise? Or shall the Flowers of the Field do more Than thee with all thy Wisdom and vain Lore? If Nature in thee first alone doth rise To sublime Consciousness of Mysteries Hid from all other Beings: if before Thy godlike Eye this World, with all it bore And bears, be as a Glass where it descries The Forms of coming Things shown visibly, Shadows cast down beforehand: Echos clear That come from and fade in Eternity, Which in the vast Bell we at all Times hear; If the invisible Things of God are by The visible revealed to thy sole Eye, Then let that Consciousness in thee appear, The Consciousness of wherefore thou art here? For when thou workÃ«st out most consciously That End, then art thou too most godlike, ne'er For getting in thyself the Deity! 3. In this so lovely World their destined Aim All Things work out, unconscious it may be, Yet still they work it out as sure as thee, Yea! surer with their Instinct, than, oh Shame! Thou with thy Reason! with the Sword and Flame Thou mar'st his Works, and oh! because thus free, Because more godlike than all else that he Has made, wilt thou alone belie thy Name? Oh! if the human Soul within thee could Work out the Godlike but as steadily, As stilly, as that Vine does what it should After its Kind, and knowing not the why Or wherefore, but content with doing Good, How bless'd wert thou in like Simplicity! 4. Couldst thou but bear thy Gooddeeds as it does Its Fruits upon its Branches, within Reach Of all, yea! e'en the Child's! or could'st thou teach Thy proud Heart to do even as the Rose, Which casts its Perfume on the Air, nor knows When next the Dew may fall! how all Things preach In Language so, so eloquent, what each In its high Maker's Service to him owes! Not e'en the Bramble bears its Thorns in vain, But inculcates this Moral with the Pain It gives the rude Grasp, that not by brute Might, But holy Gentleness, we surest gain The End proposed, thus ever in our Sight The Hand of God himself directs us right! 5. There is no Word to utter all that the Deep Soul contains: and God himself doth know (Nay, this it is that makes his Godhead) no, No other Way to utter all that he Feels, frames, thinks, save by thro' all Things that be Making some Portion of his ownself flow: He is the Unspeakable! therefore below The Soul that feels him most, is that which we Hear speaking least of Him, is that which least Can utter what it feels! the Deity Takes to himself the undivided Breast, And sends a holy Tear unto the Eye, The best Blood to the Pulse, thus to attest The Godlike, which must still unuttered lie! 6. The Low, the Common, that is loud not deep, The Love that bears no Fruit, but only Flower, Is cradled, coffined, in one fleeting Hour, And dwells much on the Lip, which it will steep With honeyed Falsehoodsâbut that which can keep The Heart warm in old Age, that dies before It utters half of what within it bore, E'en by its Deeds, not Words! it can but weep And smile unutterable Things, and press The Heart it loves in holy Consciousness, Deeper and sweeter from its Secrecy! Like unto God, in pure Meekheartedness Creating from afar the Good whereby It seeks all in its Influence to bless; Or like some Star lost in the distant Sky, But shining on contented not the less, Yea! nearer, dearer unto God's clear Eye, Because thus hid from mortal Littleness! 7. Then thou, dear Soul, go home to thy poor Cot, Content and happy with whatever Lot The Heavens assign thee, for therein thou still, Tho' but four narrow Walls embrace the Spot, Canst work out all the Godlike, and fulfill Thy Being's Aim, as well as if the Span Of this widereaching Universe were thine! Go, kiss the Brow of her who at thy Door Meets thee, and of thy little ones, and feel, Yea! with thine in most Heart, I tell thee feel That which thy Want makes but still more divine, The Consciousness of being Â«quite a Man!Â» Nor call thyself but for one moment poor, For that were Blasphemy! but break thy Bread, And ask thy Father's Blessing, and then see If'round thy Wife's and each Child's little Head, A Glory, like an Angel's, be not spread: And if thou seest it not, the Fault's in thee! Then ask thy deep Heart what it feels, and sure Twill say, I feel the quite Unspeakable, Yea! God Himself! and more I cannot tell! THE MAIDEN AND THE ROSE. Oh! Maiden, view thine Emblem in the Rose, And as the Flower guards its Beauties by Its Thorns, enshrine thou so thy Chastity In mildlysevere Thoughts, which may, like those, Repel the Nature coarse and rude, that knows Not the heartreaching Power of Modesty, But wound not that which gently woos with high Conviction of the Reverence it owes To thee in God, and God in thee: for where Meekness and Pureness most inhabit, there Is he most too! and as the Heavensdew Lies on that opening Rose, so fresh and fair, So may its choicest Blessing light on you, Heartfreshness, Feelings still to Nature true, As Flowers trembling in the Sun and Air! IRRELIGION. God! God! I feel my very Heartsblood rise, Boiling with Indignation at the Thought That divine Things should thus be sold and bought. Oh! send thy Son down once more from the Skies To cleanse the Temple of such Blasphemies: For Moneychangers there have so long wrought Their Trade of Infamy, that they have brought (In Minds that mark not where the real Ill lies) E'en thy Name into Disreputeânot worth Is longer deemed a Requisite for thy Bless'd Service, but mere worldly Wealth or Birth! And thus of Divine Things there is such Dearth, That carnalminded Priests, yea! e'en close by Thine Altar, make thy Word a Mockery! A MAYDAYWALK INTO THE COUNTRY IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE. 1 The Citybells were ringing loud, I wot not well what it was for, And in the Streets a motley Crowd Was shouting Liberty and Law. 2 Gay Streamers floated on the Air, Which kissed them with its Breath of Love, Highsounding Titles written were In golden Characters above. 3 Shout on, said I, within myself, But Freedom answers not your Call, Who couples her high Name with Pelf, In other Ears the Fool should bawl. 4 She dwells above the starry Spheres, And looking calmly down from thence The pure Soul's sublime Prayer she hears, Who grasps the Sword in Selfdefence! 5 But think ye on this Hubbub here Where Idiots deaf each other bray, She bends her from her Ether clear, Or hears one Word of all they say? 6 In some low Clime, far short of that Where her calm, serene Breath is drawn, Those idle Sounds die out, where Bat And dull Oblivion brood forlorn! 7 No Tenpoundfreeholders knows she, No Sum of Gold can buy the Right To that divine Equality In which her Worshippers delight. 8 I heard the loud Forgehammers ring, And saw the tall Smokecolumns rise, With countless Proofs how everything There aided Mammon's Victories. 9 It checked the Beatings of my Heart, I hreathed as in a stifling Mine, Whose few vile Crannies scarce impart A Reflex of the Light divine! 10 I saw the greedy Hand clutched fast, And Childhood martyred unto Gain, Receiving from the cheerless Past The Heritage of future Pain. 11 On the pale Lip no merry song, No holy Meanings in the Eye, And e'en the godlike Form by Wrong Debased irrecognizably. 12 The divine Lamp within the Soul Left void of Education's Light, Vile Clay to mould the Knave or Fool, As Chance might fashion it or Spite. 13 The Mansion left untenanted, Where a bright Angel's self should dwell, And Thorns upon the Pillow spread Where hope in golden Dreams should revel! 14 I heard loud Voices boast of Gain, Saw Envy, Bickerings, and Strife, And Men who for a Shadow vain Plucked out the Heart of social Life! 15 And Statesmen talked with loud Applause Of national Prosperity, Discussed divine and human Laws, Then sealed with Blood Man's Slavery. 16 Mammon rudejostling God aside Holds on his Altar Orgies wild, The Church, Christ's once celestial Bride, Is by Adultery defiled. 17 A Heart of Mire this God of Clay Asks as his chosen Sacrifice, And emptying their Breasts, away Men fling the Joys of Paradise. 18 Love, Mercy, Truth, Humanity, Are trodden in the Highwaydust, And these pure Jewels of the Sky For Earth's vile Mire are pawned in Trust! 19 These Jewels, which on God's own Brow Fill the celestial Halls with Light, By Panders' Hands are soiled below, Void of all Beauty in our Sight! 20 Men pluck from out the Soul its Eyes, That they may ne'er desire aught Save Mammon, yea! they'd pay the Price, Tho' e'en with God and Gospel bought. 21 Gold, Gold, the mighty Thief! he robs The Maiden's Heart of its chaste Lore, And in the Pulse, where first Love throbs, Instils the Passions of the Whore. 22 Gold whispers in the Priest's quick Ear, And while Godsname is on his Lip, Mammon rules in his Heart, and there Of sublime Faith the Wings doth clip. 23 Gold sits beside the sternbrowed Judge When Justice rises wroth to speak, And warnÃ«d by the wellknown Nudge, He shuts his Ears to Misery's Shriek! 24 Gold gives the Statesman Eloquence To turn white black, and black to white, To smooth and gloss with sly Pretence Crimes to which Power and Greed invite. 25 Then in the Blackman's Blood his Pen He'll dip and sign a Nation's Woe, Heap Ruin on his Fellowmen, Then smirk and smile, and cringe and bow. 26 We bring our Children up for Gold, 'Tis Life's grand End, the Wiseman's Aim, No matter if the Heart be cold, Be the Purse full, 'tis all the same! 27 No matter if the Lip ne'er glow, Nor the Pulse beat to divine Thought, If on the dusty Track they go, And Gold in due Amount be wrought! 28 'Tis placed within the Baby's Grasp, And glittering, snakelike, lures his Eye, Then round his Heart its Folds doth clasp, 'Till all high Feelings stifled die. 29 The Cradle thus is made the Grave Of Infancy, and Hope, and Love, And from their Wrecks the Soul can save Naught which it erst brought from above. 30 Oh England! thy once mighty Heart Is wellnigh cold within thy Breast, And its faint Beatings scarce impart A doubtful Life unto the rest. 31 Thou might'st be as a Soul of Good To the wide World, and make the Sea As the Mainartery which should Bear the Lifeblood of Liberty! 32 But Providence is just and good, And forces us to reap the Field Which we have sown with Love or Blood, Whatever Crop the Seed may yield. 33 Gold, Gold, when sought as thou hast sought it, Is Barbarism and Selfishness, With thine own Barbarism hast thou bought it, The Curse on thine own Head doth press. 34 Th' Indifference which thou hast shown To human Happiness abroad, With its unnatural Beak thine own Bowels in Vulturewise hath gnawed! 35 The selfsame Spirit here at bome Hath scourged with cruel Laws thy Sons, And stained with Blood Streams that should come Pure from the Fount whence Justice runs. 36 Thro' this too antique Prejudice Begets on Change a motley Brood, Halfman, halfsavage, Centaurwise, Hermaphrodite of Bad and Good. 37 These Thoughts had made me very sad, The City seemed a Smithy vast, The Sun shone bright, the Earth was glad, But Gloom hung o'er it from the Past. 38 But as I left its Din behind, And all its evil Sounds and Sights, A gentler Mood stole o'er my Mind, Sadness which has its own Delights. 39 With every Step I happier grew, And as o'er the sweet Flowers I trod, I smelt the Perfume of their Dew Sent like an Incense up to God, 40 Not in four, narrow Walls I stood, With Worldlings fashionably drest, Preserving in Godshouse the Mood Of Life's vain Fever and Unrest: 41 No Priest mouthed o'er the Words of Love, Or robbed them of their divine Grace, But Inspiration from above My Soul to her high Task did brace. 42 A lovely Vision rose before My Sight, and like some Feverdream, The City and its Din no more Than a vain Fancyfreak did seem; 43 Wood, Hill, and Plain, before me lay, At bright aerial Distance seen, And still before I saw my Way Leading by Stream and Meadow green. 44 Sunglancing Spires in Distance rose, Some bosomed deep in antique Trees, Of which each one its old Tale knows But whispered only to the Breeze! 45 And by the Breeze to Poet brought, Dreaming by haunted Wood or Stream, And who can by celestial Thought Some Fragments of the Past redeem. 46 Then many an old forgotten Song Comes sweeping past upon his Ear, And on his Mindseye Phantoms throng From Graves of many a buried Year. 47 These waken 'neath the Poet's Tread, Some stirring like a Trumpetsblast, And others soft and sweet, as fed By Memories of Loves long past. 48 Some whisper like a Womanslip, Mourning o'er Guile and broken Vows, And some like Tempestwinds which strip The Autumnleaves from off the Boughs. 49 And with them come all mingled Sounds And Sights that Eye or Ear can know, Farechoing Horns and baying Hounds, Reflected in a Lake below. 50 And Castles frowning o'er the Steep Of some hoar, rivergirdled Rock, Which down beneath in Eddies deep, For Ages to the old Towerclock 51 Hath sung wild Music: then as on The Phantasmagoria moves, Cities sleeping in the Sun, And learnÃ«d Academic Groves; 52 Where Infant-Art and Science lay, In the still Arms of Solitude And Time longcradled, 'till the Day When they grew powerful for Good. 53 Gay Tournement and Plumes that dance In Fancy's golden Atmosphere, Who with her Wand loves to enhance All she presents to Eye or Ear. 54 Then up a Dustcloud rises high, With Spears sunglancing seen above, Hark! the Onsetshock, the Cry, Tramp of Coursers, Thrust and Shove. 55 And now its Echo fades away Longthrilling on the inward Ear, And as his Dream that bygone Day And all its Uproar doth appear! 56 Anon he looks o'er leaguered Towns And Tents, War's Stir and Panoply, With Glimpses, o'er greenswelling Downs, Of Fleets and the bluebosomed Sea. 57 And as the Mirror lets us know The Features else we ne'er should see, So do these Visions truly show Our doublefaced Humanity! 58 Then up he wakes as tho' he'd been Years in another World, for Thought Can crowd into a Momentsspace What Time's slow Centuries have wrought! THE WANDERER. Barefoot he is, and scantyclothÃ«d too 'Gainst Life's rude Blasts, yet Comfort's in his Eye, And Age sits on his Greyhead cheerily, Strewing with gentle Hand its gradual Snow. Tho' he be worldforsaken, he doth show No Signs of Desolation: evernigh An unseen Power props him inwardly, And to an ampler Shape his Soul doth grow, 'Till the Claytenement can hold no more! He can create around an Atmosphere Of Joy, and send abroad from his Heartscore A Beauty and a Brilliance, still to cheer The Forms of outward Being: with high Lore His Faith is fraught, and by it he sees clear! ON PURELIVING. Oh live this Life as a Foresabbath to The long, calm Sabbath of Eternity, And ever in Imagination's Eye Let this fair World, domed by the Heavensblue, Be but as a Foretemple, Forecourt, thro' Which thou must pass to reach the Sanctuary, Unto the Holy of all Holies, nigh The inmost Shrine, to spiritual View Revealing the One God! when holy Death, Sole Porter at the Gates of Paradise, Shall let thee inâlive pure then, draw the Breath Of daily Life like Incense for the Skies: And let thy Thoughts be innocent as are The Flowers of the Field, without Disguise! Tho' clothed with Beauty, they show forth not their, But his sole Glory, who first bade them rise; Go! let thy Life like Testimony bear! ON THE ANTINOUS IN THE FLORENCE FINEARTSGALLERY. Music!âwhat Music e'er was like to thy Low Voice, Antinous, which fills the Ear Like Seraphechos from some happier Sphere? How often have I listened, while hardby The vulgar Herd passed on unconsciously, As if there were no Language save that here Which we employ, distuned by Grief and Fear: As if there were no Utterance, calm and high, Whose slightest Whisper is far mightier than The Thunder, and whose Echos die away In Regions far beyond the Thought of Man! Yet 'tis, alas! not always that I may Hear those sweet Accents: Silence, chill and wan, Seals the cold Lips, which speak not to dull Clay! WISDOM. Wisdom is ever young, she cherishes A childlike Heart, and takes Delight in Things Which seem of little Worth: and as his Wings The Butterfly expands to Summerskies, So she her Heart to the least Impulses Of holy Natureâ not a Bird that sings By Wood-or-Streamside, but she thereto brings A willing Ear, a Heart which strives and tries In Lowliness and Love to comprehend; And as to Love there is no Mystery, So thro' the Birdsmouth Nature's self will send From th' universal Heart an Impulse high, Which hers with it in quiet Strength shall blend, And pour a hidden Worth thro' Ear and Eye! CONSCIENCE. Oh thou sweet Voice, thou Voice of dearest Friend, For ever prompting at my inmost Ear To Thoughts of holy Awe, and wholesome Fear Of that which is not right, 'tis thine to send After a Gooddeed Music that doth blend With our Soul's very Essence, and we hear The far off Angelchoirs more sweet and near, Whispering in Joy around: oh! that each End Of Life may meet thy Praise, still gently give Me holy Admonitions how to live: Oh may I list thy sweet Voice evermore Tuning my Soul to Music: let the Strife Of earthly Sounds have o'er my Ear no Power, But in thy calm, deep Wisdom be my Lore! A PROPHECY. When shall Man Brother be to Man, the Brand Inglorious rust, or haply be but scanned With curious Eye â a Token of those Days, When the Sword reaped a Harvest of more Praise Than Pen tho' wielded by a Milton's Hand, And flashing sublime Lightnings o'er the Land? The Dust of many Ages on his Wing Must Time first gather, ere to Hope he bring This rich FulfillmentâMen must first be taught By what Means all enduring Things are wrought: That Conquests of the Sword are palpable, And, like the Hand that wields it, pass away! That those of Mind alone enduring dwell, Like the Soul whence they sprang, a Good for aye! And they must learn too, that the beating Heart Of human Love is still Man's noblest Part; And that to God the Offering most dear, Is of that Love, one little, heartfelt Tear! HOPE. Hope is the greatest Thief and Juggler! he Robs us of this fair Present, of the Hour Which is our own, and which he has no Power To give us back, with all his Jugglery, For that which we may never live to see; He lures us on from each ripe Fruit and Flower, Still promising us sweeter, 'till to our Heartsgrief we reach that bright Futurity, Painted so fair, and find naught but the Grave, From which the Sunset has just died away! And weary with the vain Chace which we have Followed so long, we sit down on the gray, Old, mossy Stone, and while the dark Yews wave Above us, listen to the Sculls, which say, Â«Here Traveller is the Bourne of thy long Way, Take one more Look of Life, for soon naught save A few Bones and vain Name, to such as stray Here, will repeat the Warning which we give Thee now, and bid the Fool make haste to live!Â» He who has not learnt what Life should be 'till Told by the Grave, its Ends can ne'er fulfill! CHILDHOODREMINISCENCES. 1 Sweet early Years, pure early Years, Oh ye are flown away, Your pleasant Smiles are turned to Tears, Your Hopes Time doth gainsay. 2 Like Summerbees, ye wandered o'er The first, fresh Flowers of Life, Yet now, alas, ye be bear no more Your Honey to the Hive! 3 Oh 'tis a saddening Thought to think On the oweet Days of Youth, When Time has forced our Lips to drink The bitter Draught of Truth. 4 There are whom Sorrow touches light, Whose Joys do not fly fleet, Yet the first View most charms the Sight, And the first Taste's most sweet. 5 Yes, even these may sigh, to think Their Hearts less pure are grown, For who may Life's dark Waters drink, Yet wish no Thing undone? 6 Who has not often wished to be Again a little Child, From Memory, Thought, and Passion free, As artless and as wild? 7 Oh could I lay my weary Head Upon my Mother's Breast, I would give Wealth and Fame instead For one such Hour of Rest! 8 But never on such Pillow more My throbbing Heart can lie, That Breast is now not as before, And oh! changed too am I! 9 E'en on that Pillow Time has strown The Thorns that wound me most, And should I seek it, 'twould alone Bring Dreams of what I've lost! 10 My Mother's Breast, on which the Flood Of youthful Fancies fair I poured, so happy! for how could I dream of Sorrow there? 11 Whereon I wept my sweetest Tears, Aye Tears more sweet than Joy, And sighed in Peace the Moment's Fears, Which stir but not annoy. 12 My Mother's Breast! on which I breathed My Aspirations bright For Fame and Name, while Fancy wreathed Her Laurels for the Fight. 13 Fade Daydreams sweet, your Rainbowhues Have melted all in Air, Ye were as in the Flower the Dews Which Midday finds not there. 14 Or if some few should still survive Of the whole Swarm, scarce one Returns unto the ruined Hive Whence all it loved are gone. 15 The young Enthusiasm that shed Its Light so brilliantly Upon Life's Dawn, is cold and dead, Or smouldering doth lie. 16 Yet Poesy her Torch has lit At the expiring Flame, And the pure Altarfire, with it Enkindled, burns the same. 17 She can unweave Life's Web again And blend it as she will, She makes a Dream of Grief and Pain, A Child at Moments still. 18 And tho' the Poet often find His Inspiration bright In his own Throes, th' immortal Mind Sublimes them to Delight! 19 Yet there are Griefs which Poesy In vain would seek to heal, Yes, Griefs which have a Sanctity, Which the true Heart must feel. 20 Sorrows which Love has holy made, Where Fancy's Sacriledge, Which never from fond Memory fade, Which are Affection's Pledge. 21 The Ivy from the Tree is shorn And leaves it slightly scarred, But Graftboughs when once rudely torn Are both by one Blow marred. 22 Sweet early Years, pure early Years, Tho' ye be flown away, Yet not for ye I shed these Tears, Claimed from our poor, frail Clay, 23 I mourn the many Links intwain Snapp'd from that chain of Love Which binds our Hearts, that viewless Chain By Angels forged above. 24 That Chain which binds the Earth to Heaven, And blends them into one: To which the least Touch by Love given, Runs straight to God's own Throne! 25 My Heart is inly stirred and full, With Thoughts of bygone Years, I cannot see, mine Eyes grow dull, Filled with unbidden Tears: 26 My Home, my Home! with all its bright And gladsome Looks of Love Once more I see, a Dream that might The sternest Spirit move! 27 For as some green Nook smiles amid The wildest Alpine Heights, So in Man's Heart are Feelings hid, Which the cold World ne'er blights! 28 Enough, 'tis idle thus to wake A Sorrow half at Rest, Yet Memory at Times will shake The Stoic from our Breast! 29 Can I forget that such Things were? Were! and to me how dear! Look at the Leaves the Branches bear, So sapless and so sere! 30 Vain Mourner stop: thine Hourglass take, And thoughtfull turn it o'er, Think in its Span how little make A few, brief Moments more! 31 Would selfish Grief recall to Earth, From Bliss undreamt below, The Beings whem we loved, whose Birth Linked Joy more close with Woe? 32 He who the Wound thinks fit t'ordain, Gives too the Power to bear, Cease then his Wisdom to arraign, He visits but to spare. 33 Cheaply is bought the World to come With thoughtbrief Pains in this: 'Tis o'er! Time's fleeting Dream is done, We wakeâ to Life and Bliss. HOPE. 1. That which we hope, we have already: far, Far loveher than if e'en now our own: 'Tis twofold beautiful, for it is shown Like to an unreal Thing, or as a Star, On Life's far off Horizon, whose Beams are Sent thus into our Souls, ere it sinks down, And the Spot where it stood remains unknown, When we draw near to grasp it and to mar! And yet 'tis real, more real than if it were Already in Possession: thus thro' Hope Do we enlarge a thousandfold Joy's Scope, For all the Meanwhile by that Vision fair, Like to a Glory on our Path, still there, Are we attended, and by it we ope 2. The Treasurechamber of the Joys which lie In the far Years, and tho' they be but as Shadows softgliding o'er the Magicglass Held by the Future up to Fancy's Eye, Yet they to us are pure Reality, If we as real enjoy them, ere they pass Away and are forgotten: when I was A Boy, I do remember well how I By mere Intensity of hoping made My Fancies to come true: the Passingday Was but a friendly Steppingstone, by Aid Of which I speeded surer on my Way Over Time's Torrent, which between me lay And the dear Object after which I prayed. 3. Thus what we hope we have: at least all Bliss, (Nay more,) that it can yield is ours, and this, Methinks, is the best Part of it: what more Could the Thing itself bring? besides, before Possession it has something vague and vast, And exists unto Fancy, but when past, It becomes a mere Fact, and Fancy is Compelled to fold her Wings: it is then to Mere Sense reduced: and tho' more real and true In one Way, for the Hand grasps and the Eye Beholds it, yet it is too palpably Possessed, and thus the Soul its Part doth miss, The best, methinks, the Sense of its Infinity! SUGGESTED BY THE LITTLE STATUE OF LOVE SLEEPING ON A LION, WITH HIS TORCH BESIDE HIM, IN THE UFFIZI GALLERY AT FLORENCE. 1. Oh thoughtless Love! thy Torch will burn away, Thus sleeping: yet how many Hearts still need To be touched by its holy Flame!âindeed The World is not so much beneath thy Sway As Poets feign, and Mortals go astray When thou, their surest Guide, art gone: the Seed Of all good Things thy quickening Warmth must feed. It is no Time for Sleeping! wake, I pray: Thou art the Civilizer, thou alone, And in thy Absence human Beings grow More savage than the Lion thou liest on. I'll wake theeâ but now that I think on't, no, I'll steal thy Torch: alas! what Good were done? Thou thyself in each Heart the Spark must throw! 2. But thou art not the divine Love I sought, Else would'st thou not lie slumbering idly here, Thou art the fabled Love, whose Realm is sere As Autvmn's withered Leaf, and good for nought, Save for a Poet's Rhyme! How little thought The Grecian Bard of that sublimer Sphere Of Christian Charities, which thou shouldst cheer: Thou art the Love of Poesy, and fraught With many a fancied Charm, but thou couldst not Descend to soften and sublime the Lot Of poor and suffering Humanity! No heavenly Ministries were thine, the Eye Of Passion to unfilm: to free from Blot And Stain the Soul, and fit it for the Sky! 5.There are no sections 3 or 4 in the source text. Thy Reign it overâ therefore slumber on: Thy Torch is fed with no celestial Fire, And, fallen from thy Grasp, will soon expire. Lo! thou thyself art changed by Time to Stone, A Moral Fragment of a World that's gone: Like antique Hieroglyphics, which require Something to piece them out: with Meanings higher By Time invested than those which their own Inventors dreamt of! I could fall asleep Beside thee, for such Glimpses calm and deep, Into the Life of Things, break in on me, That with the Body's Eye I no more see: Thy Torch now blazes, and by it I read Nature's Papyrusroll, before me spread: Not Language she employs alone, but by Man's Generations writes her History. Each fond Memento left us by the Dead Is as an Hyeroglyphic on the old Sarcophagus of some past World, t' unfold What lies within, if wellinterpreted, Like Half reliefs, which yet serve to suggest And help the Fancy to piece out the Rest: We lift the Lid, and see the Mummy rolled Up like a Chrysalis's Husk, whence Man Has passed to purer Forms, an ampler Span Of Being, as the cast off Sloughs attest! WEALTHSNOTHINGNESS IN ITSELF. Deem not the Richman envyworthy 'till Thou know'st well what he is in his own heart! For Riches themselves do not make us rich, Wealth itself teaches not the Use of Wealth, It bringeth no such Heritage, else were It Wealth indeed, and worthy of the Name. All Blessings of real Value still must be Earned by ourselves, and not inherited At others' Hands: our Labour makes their Worth, They are the Labour itself, and the more Of Sacrifice there be, the more divine Their Nature: and in order to reward Us fitly, they are felt to be so most, When we have disciplined and schooled our Souls To deem them cheaply bought at any Price, By any sacrifice of vulgar Goods. 'Till toiling towards some seeming distant Goal, Some Blessing which we fancy different from The Labour leading to it, with Surprize And Joy we find the very Toil become The Blessing which we sought for! while the Bad Believe that Labour to be bitter Pain: And so it is, until we inly feel Delight from it, and looking not beyond, And asking nothing at our Father's Hands, Beceive the Fullness of Reward from that Which promised least of all! then Poorman be Thou of good Cheer: if thou wilt but think so, Thou art not poor: the proudest Monarch on The Earth is not so rich, nor can he give So generously! when from thy Daysbread Thou giv'st a Mouthfull to the hungry Child That begs of thee, thou givest more than Kings, Who scatter thousands which they do not miss, Nor know the Use of! does the Flower smell Sweeter, or show more lovely to the Eyes Of sated Wealth, than unto thine, when for Thy Daughter's Hair, upon the Sabbathmorn, Thou pluck'st them from the Rosebush twin'd around Thy Cottagedoor, the Growth of thine own Hand? My Friend, their perfume is so sweet e'en by That very Sweat, that low, despisÃ«d Toil, Wherewith thou earn'st thy bread: for when God gives A Blessing, that can make Life's seeming Bitter So sweet, can make its very wants and needs A Source of Overwealth, of truest wealth: A Source of Virtues, which bloom forth like flowers, Filling all round with sweetness and perfume, And scattering on this coarse, familiar Earth Seeds to renew, and thousandfold, the Joys Which they first yielded: Joys of Paradise! 'Till e'en the sharp Flints 'neath thy naked feet Are for thy Faith's sake turned to softest Down, And o'er the hard stone upon which thou lay'st Thy weary head, an Angel spreads one wing To pillow thee, as soft as ever Babe Was cradled on his Mother's beating Heart, And with the other screens thy bare, poor brow, And lightly touching with his divine lips Thy sleeping mouth, breathes into thy sad Heart, The Blessedness, the Peace, which fills his own! EVENINGTHOUGHTS. 1 The Eveningstar is in the Sky, And shineth with its holiest Light, The Villagebells are ringing nigh, Like Voices full of past Delight. 2 The Eveningbreeze wafts on my Ear The Music of the closing Day, And Sounds that wake the slumbering Tear, With Thoughts of those who're far away. 3 How many Chords has Memory, That link the Present with past Things, And wake to Joy or Agony, If some Chancebreath but kiss the Strings. 4 There is in that glad Villagechime, A Voice as of my early Youth, And yearning Thoughts of that sweet Time, When words were things, and Hope all truth. 5 How many scenes are in each tone, Of Home, and Peace, and Infancy, Of many hearts blent as in one, One Hope, one Joy, one Memory. 6 Those Hopes are nipped by Time's harsh breath, Life woos, then stings the cheated mind, The flowers fall, and leave beneath But naked thorns, and scathÃ«d rind. 7 Home's dear ones, one by one, depart, And nought is left to tell their Lot, Save a dull Void within the Heart, The Cousciousness that they are not. 8 Those Eveningbells, those Eveningbells, Sound merry to the careless ear, But a sad tale their music tells To such as mourn o'er times so dear. 9 They take their tone from man's deep heart, To him who has a home 'tis glad, But unto those who feel the smart Of homeless griefs, 'tis sweetly sad. 10 Those Eveningbells will still ring on, For other hearts, and other ears, As blithe and merry when I'm gone, And wake to Joy or stir to Tears. 11 Strange, that so blithe a Sound should wind Like Passingbell around my heart, But Memory, ever-wake, will find A grief, where grief should have no part. 12 The mighty heart of Nature speaks With the same calm, deep voice of yore, But man interprets it and seeks Vain echos of the passing hour. 13 Those sounds have died upon the air, And like a snowflake on the wave, They melt into my heart, and bear It to that Land beyond the Grave. 14 The Eveningstar still shines above, With a calm, clear, and steady Light, And seems to chide me, but in Love, Tho' Earth be dark, still Heaven's bright. 15 My hopes shall rise, oh God, to thee, And like the dew that falleth now, Return to fresh my heart, to free It from the Fret of thoughts so low.â ON ILLLUCKBEARING. Vex not thy Soul with Troubles past and gone, When coming, gather all thine Energies To check or lessen them: for Victories May even from what seems Defeat be won; And to have done our utmost, that alone Is Victory's best Part! for tho' the Prize Proposed be missed, a sure Good ever lies Within our Reach, the Strengthening our own Resources, and that Man ne'er knows Defeat, Who rises stronger from each Loss. Then treat The Ill but just gone by as if it were A timegray Grief, and lightly as on Air The Child a Feather blows, so let it pass. For to fret at it is to make what was A present Ill: feel not that which thou art Alone, for that is of thee the least Part, But feel all that thou mayst become and be, Then will the Calmness of Eternity Descend on thee, for God is in thy Heart; And where he is must it not be so? yea! For what is Heaven if not God's Presence, pray? REAL LIFE Oh! lovely Things are yet untold, and still More lovely yet undreamt of, neither Ear Has heard, nor Eye beheld, that which I hear And look on: yet 'tis no vain Dream to fill Fancy's dilating Eye, called up at Will, And lost when she her Eyelid shuts. Sleep ne'er Could call up with her Wand such Sights as here Truth's sober, waking Eyes look on; what Skill Would not that Poet have who could but see, Feel, and describe, Life's bare Reality, Not dreaming it, but living itâ awake With Heart and Eye! but then, methinks too, he Would deem it a vain Thing thereof to make A few poor Verses, for itself would be So, so godlike a Poem, that one Day Would be worth more than Homer's Odyssee! Then live thy Lifeâ most richly 'twill repay The Living it. The Real alone and True Are godlike, make thy Life then so â then too Will it be godlike, else an idle Dream, A Shadow floating o'er th'eternal Blue! For if thou thyself art not real, then to Thine Eyes this World no longer real will seem. But to feel it and thyself real, that is The Life of Manâ I mean not real in this Low Sense of touching and of seeing, no! But in that Sense in which 'tis real to his Enlarged Capacity, who seeing thro' It as if it were chrystal, yea! e'en to The one allfilling Light that makes it so, Thus Â«feels that we are greater than we know!Â» ALL GOES WELL WITH US WHEN WE GO WELL. Â«Aye, when the World goes better with meâthenâÂ» My Friend, thou hast not spoken wisely: when Thou goest better with the World, the World Will then go well thee! Believe me, it Is so! if thou dost right, and meanest well, The World cannot go ill with thee, tho' thou Hast nothing but the Heart within thy Breast! Lose not the Good, in seeking thus the Better; The Good, if once attained, will itself soon Create the Better: thou canst not o'erleap One least Link in the wise and lovely Chain, One least, no, not the lowest, Step of all On that bright Ladder of fair Virtues, which Like Jocob's leads up to the Ether clear, And whereby they like Angels still ascend And descend, bearing Missions from God's Throne, And holy Fire from Truth's Altar, which Burneth eternally before God's Face, Fanned by the Archangel's everwakeful Wings. How canst thou become better, if thou art Not good first? verily, one Virtue lays The Basis of all others: the Keystone Which best supports that goodly Arch whereon Selfempire's Fabric rises, is no more Nor less than Â«PatienceÂ», which can turn all Ill To unmixed Good, by bearing it as if It had no Poison: do but one Gooddeed, And that which follows it will be still better! The second stirs already in the Womb, The chaste Womb of the first: the Angel's Wings, You feel them fluttering, and with a Thought, The Angel's self stands bright before your Eyes, Holding one Hand out to thee like thy Child, Thy firstborn, in whose Presence thou wouldst not Be guilty of an impure Act, nay! of An impure Thoughtâ think but one noble Thought: Let but its Warmth once circle thro' thy Heart, And others, like the Stars that follow on The Eveningstar, 'till Heaven be all Light, Will link themselves to it, and gather like A Glory o'er thy Brow, 'till thou appear 'st, Nay art, an Angel, many, all in one, Embraced in thee as all Things are in God! For the Goodman enjoyeth all the Good: Wheree'er a Gooddeed's done, a good Thought thought, He does and thinks them, yea! as truly as The Doer and the Thinker himself can! NOTHING THAT INVOLVES A RIGHT OR A PRINCIPLE UNIMPORTANT. 1. Know ye not that great Motives may be found In what seem merest Trifles? small Things bear Great Issues with them, and oft by a Hair The Weal of Mankind is together bound With that of its least Member: yet 'tis sound And strong, yea! stronger far than if it were Of Adamant: a Link of that so fair Yet viewless Spiritchain, which stretches round The Universe, and keeps the Life of Man In due Relation to the mighty Plan: Binding a Buonaparte or Cromwell just As well as their least Subject; which nor Rust Of Time can wear, nor Strength of Mortal rend, So gently forcing all Things to one End! 2. Then when thou seest the most despisÃ«d of God's Creatures injured, be thou not above Resenting it: think not that he alone Is injured, that 'tis his Cause, not thine own; See not in him the Outcast that he is, But the great God insulted thus in his Poor Form, as in the Majesty of Kings! Then will thy Thought unfold sublimer Wings, And from this Point of View thou'lt clearly see That those who injure him must injure thee, For he who injures God, must injure all, Since God is allâand that which seems not small, Nor insignificant in God's own Eyes, Wilt thou, oh erring Mortal, dare despise? 3. Thus view Injustice in whatever Form; Not when done to the Beggarman alone, (For is not God his Father as thine own?) But, yea! I say, tho to the least, least Worm That crawls on God's own blessed Earth: for by A purer and enlarged Humanity Man blesses himself, blessing others! when He guards his Fellow's Rights as his own, then First truly are his own to him secured! And that which for another he endured Becomes an Egis, not for his sole Breast, But for that of Mankind, the surest, best: The heavenfallen Shield, on which depends A Nation's Wellfare, which alone defends It from all Foesâ inviolable, yea! As God himself, nay, one with him for aye! No idle Fable but a Truth divine; Then shield with it thy Fellow's Breast and thine! NIGHTTHOUGHTS. 1 The sky-lamps one by one are lit, And thro' night's gloom their faint rays flit, Like thoughts that thro' Eternity Wander 'till lost in mystery. 2 Or like the glance that Memory gives At times to cradleyears, and strives To lift the veil that hides for aye The spirit's first Promethean Ray. 3 How manyvoiced the nightwinds sigh, Seeming to speak as they whisper by, To commune low with each dewy flower, To give and to borrow a mystic power. 4 And as it were at their destined Call, The withered leaves scarce murmuring fall, While the springtide ones more blithely wave, As if for them time had no grave! 5 And calm the Earth lies, fresh and green, Laughing beneath the pure stars' sheen, Like babe beneath its mother's eye, Ere yet its lip hath learnt to lie. 6 As a Spellmirror the sky might seem, Where of future things the shadows gleam, And the stars are wove in wordlike guise, But their Language is not for mortal eyes. 7 Oh who can gaze on their mystic ray, Nor feel the Earth pass 'neath his feet away, And his spirit plunge from Time's dark shore,, Like a Swimmer afloat on Thought's frail oar 8 Alas! it is in vain we dive The depth of things to be, and strive To fling aside our nothingness, And grow to Gods or little less. 9 E'en at the moment when, most free, We ope our eyes, and trust to see: The dazzling light but glances on Our filmy sight, and all is gone. 10 I turn to Earth, alas! 'tis fair, But what I seek I find not there, 'Tis beautiful, and calmly still, But yet my heart is sad and chill.â 11 In the brake the bird is singing, Echo's undersong is ringing, On the sward the stars are shining, All is peace, nought seems repining. 12 The mellowthroated Nightingale Sings joyous, but it sounds a wail: The far off brook is babbling on, To me it tells of bright days gone: 13 Fond Memory wanders o'er the scene And tells me what I might have been, And Hope from life's vain Future brings No Peacebranch on his drooping wings. 14 Alas! he must renew his flight To farther realms, beyond the night Of Time, or else for ever miss The Olivebranch, the pledge of bliss. 15 There is no beauty on the Earth, Save that which in the heart has birth: And not a pulse the peace can share Of Nature, if sin's fret be there. 16 By prayer we tune the Spirit's lyre, And fit it thus for accents higher Than aught that earthborn strains can wake, That jar the strings, the true tone break. 17 Then merry shall the bird's note seem, And Joy speak in the babbling stream, And the Spirit on Faith's Eaglewing Shall soar, and list the Angels sing. 18 Then shall the heart an echo be Of Nature's Centreharmony, Oft with the Bird again shall sing, And drink like him at Nature's spring. THE GRAVEHAUNTER. 1 Why sitt'st thou on that old gravestone, Thou grayhaired Man of many Years? Speaks it, like thee, of things bygone, Why melt thy dim, old Eyes to tears? 2 Thereat the oldman tremblingly Raised up his timebowed face of pain, First cast a wistful glance at me, Then bent it on the stone again. 3 Oh 'twas a sad, sad sight, to see That poor oldman, forlorn and lone, Like a stormscathed and leafless tree, With all its Autumnfruitage strown. 4 Of the Churchyard he seemed a part, So silent, old, so still and grey, Sitting like Time, without his dart, And mourning over Life's decay. 5 Then traced he, with Grief's finger slow, A name which he had cleaned of late From rank, oblivious weeds, that grow 'Till all we love be out of date. 6 Each Letter seemed to stab his heart! Tho' from the tombs of those who sleep Time may efface their names, his art But graves them in the heart more deep. 7 When the oldman had traced the name, He gazed into my face and said, âShe was the last of allâthey came Like springflowers, and are now all dead! 8 And yet I live, tho' old and gray, Mourning for those should cherish me. Thereat he bent him down, and lay Lost in his own deep agony. 9 Alas! when from the Tree of life Th' unopened Buds fall first to Earth, Time steals the best sweets of Love's hive, And what he leaves are little worth. 10 Such tears are holy, shed by one Who suffers thus chastised by Heaven, Swifter than prayers their way is won, And pardon for their sake is given. 11 And when those natural drops were shed, The oldman rose from off the stone, And then his tottering steps I led Down the Yardpath his Daywalk grown. 12 When to the Churchyardgate we came, He turned with lingering step once more, For the Towerbell had chimed, the same That speaketh with the voice of yore. 13 Thereon he heaved a deepdrawn sigh, And passed his Hand athwart his Face, Â«Heaven's will be doneÂ» he said, for I Am a poor sinner, needing grace! 14 Then as we left the Church behind, And objects varied as we moved, The scene induced a calmer mind, The oldman talked of those he loved. 15 I was a happy Man indeed, The father of five goodly Boys, And one sweet Girl, who in my need A ministering Angel was; 16 My Wife died first, and one by one, My goodly boys were torn away, Once scathed the stem, the fruit thereon Sank with it, ere my head was grey. 17 Yet still my dear, dear girl was left; In us the spirits of the rest Seem'd blent in one, and tho' bereft I felt I was not allunblest. 18 But Heaven was pleased still more to try My fortitude, and lest I should Forget that nobler Bourne on high, Chastised me unto mine own good. 19 There is a fitter place of meeting For spirits severed here below, To teach me what I was forgetting, My girl was soon snatched from me too. 20 Oh stranger, hast thou ever known What 'tis to be alone on Earth, Having been loved? thy homehearts strown, And by their absence feel their worth? 21 My girl, she had such winning ways, I half forgot in her the rest, She was to my old eyes like rays Of light, each loved the other best. 22 Oh had you heard her softtoned voice, Or seen her seek my Bedroomdoor With tiptoe caution, lest the noise Should break my rest, and list an hour! 23 And if she saw me hide my Tears, She'd kiss me, then point to the skies, She had a sense beyond her years, For Love perfects the faculties! 24 Then she would read the Biblepage, On some calm, quiet Sabbatheve, She seemed an angel sent to 'suage, With words of promise, those who grieve. 25 But she is in her grave, and I Am here, a lone oldman, of Years And Sorrows full; but Misery Shall turn to Smiles, tho' born in Tears! 26 The Oldman's simple tale was done! And we had reached his cottagedoor, Where a wild Eglantine had spun Its thriftless tendrils, pruned no more. 27 The old Man looked, and shook his head, His grey hairs stirrÃ«d in the wind, Â«It used not to be so, he said, Time has left naught to mourn behind.Â» 28 They are but emblems of what's gone, Of what has faded from the Earth: Of all that's noble, no not one But has in Heaven a second birth. 29 And with these words the oldman turned, And prophetlike his features glowed, A holier spirit thro' them burned, And thro' the Man th' Immortal showed. 30 If of an oldman's blessing thou Disdainest not the humble gift, 'Tis thine, and when this frame lies low, Some thoughts of me thy soul may lift. 31 Tho' baffled oft on this cold Earth, The Love we bear our household-hearts, Hath its fulfilment, and imparts E'en by its Anguish higher Worth. 32 The oldman's blessing and his words Sank thro' my heart, like fresh'ning dew, And as I turned away, the birds Their strains seem'd blither to renew. 33 Oft have I passed the oldman's cot In Afteryears, and other Mood, And soothed my own with his sad Lot, And learnt in evil to know good. 34 There is a wisdom which doth bow, Heartwisdom, born of sufferings, That wound the Heart, therein to sow The seeds of future blessings. 35 And there are tears which those who weep Are holy in Godssight above The vain Lipworshippers, who keep The Letter, but from Fear, not Love. 36 Where Love is not, there is no Law, A Law unto himself He is: Instead of Law, fulfilling Law, And in fulfilling finds His bliss. 37 There's Wisdom in simplicity, And dignity in lowliness, And to be last is still to be Great in our very littleness. 38 And Joys there are in misery, That happiness has never known, A Service which is Liberty, And visions but to virtue shown. 39 Then let our eyes be dimmed with tears, Our hearts be purified by pain, Faith still can bear the weight of years, And make Mortality a Gain! ON FEELING IMMORTAL. Wouldst thou feel and be as Immortal, here On Earth, tho' a frail mortal Man? then be Completely occupied with that which the Mere passing Hour brings with it. Thus Fear Of coming Ills, or Thought of pass'd, will ne'er Disturb thee: Past and Future are to thee As Naught, each Moment an Eternity, Without End or Beginning! Time, a mere Unmeaning Wordâupon a small Scale, thou Art like to God himself: for, thinking naught Of thine ownself, thou art not conscious how Or what Change by the Years in thee is wrought. And if the Soul feels itself only now, It feels th' Eternal only, as it ought! THE WOODWALK IN THE SOUTH. It was an antique Wood of untold Growth, Primeval Shades! not by the busy Hand Of Mortal planted, but by Nature's self, As is her Wont, when she luxuriates In all her boundless Wealth, and scatters round, With more than Fancy's rich Variety, Her neverending Multitude of Hues And Fairyshapes, yet all in perfect Taste And Keeping with her comprehensive Plan. The Wood, with living Verdure dense, stretched far In sightoutreaching Loveliness, o'er Hill, And Dale, and Rock: and where the Eye could trace The ridgelike Heavings of the changeful Earth, In Waves of Vegetation, as it were, The Greenery flowed on: 'till o'er its Skirts, The deep blue Heavens in sweet Contrast, where The rosy Flush of Sunset lingered still, Brooding shut out all View of Scenes beyond. The Stars were gathering: one by one they broke The balmy Twilight, like to Eyes of Love, Full of deep Meanings to the thoughtfull Heart; For all Things have their Mission, and are fraught With gentle Visitations to the Soul That links them with the one great Cause of all! But of a brighter Beam, more calm and clear, They seemed to me, than when from this dim Earth Beheld, this Earth by its own Mists made dim. And my Soul spake to me: how stilly God. Accomplishes his Wonders! see yon Stars, So countless, that Imagination sinks Oppressed by merest Fact! that what the Eye, Thro' the farreaching Glass, takes in, can scarce Find Room within Man's Brain, Man's narrow Brain! And yet he thinks to grasp the God who made These Wonders, when the Wonders themselves are Beyond Conception! so that Wonder, no More capable of itself, grows to doubt That which it sees, outwondered of itself! And yet how stilly all moves on, so still, That but to pluck a Dayseye from the Grass, Makes more noise than the Setting of a Star! So stilly works He out the Godlike, so Sublimely, modestly, that we, we Men, Not comprehending aught so unlike what We feel and do, forget that He exists: Because he is not little like ourselves, We disbelieve the Godlike that he is! Because He does not every Day appear, As in the Firebush, and on a Scale Adapted to our Faculties work out Some little Wonder, (and what was the Bush, But as a Spark from out the Blaze of his Unutterable Glory?) He is no More God forsooth! and does he not each Day, In far, far other than the Firebush Appear to Faith's clear Eyes? does He not shine And glow thro' this whole World, thro' countless Worlds, Scattered like Sparks of Glory o'er the Sky? But it demands the Eye of God himself To see this Wonder as it is! that so Sublimelymodest Eye, which will not look On its own Glory, and which watching still, Looks on the least Worm crawling in the Dust Rather than on itself! for even God Keeps not his Eye fixed on himself: and yet 'Twere pardonable in him so to do, Were he not God!âand if it be not then Excusable in Him to do so, be- Cause he is God, how much less so in Man, Because he's Man'! so measurelessly less Than God, whose sublime Modesty exalts Him above all his Creatures, more than all His Might and Glory! who shows forth in them His Power, as if it were but something Inherent in themselves, and not of Him! But Man, Man understands not how God works: For 'till he is himself godlike, how can He comprehend the Godlike?âhe it is Who keeps his Eye fixed ever on himself, And being little that can fill his Eye And Heart: not like to God's, capacious, vast, And comprehending all Hearts, or at least, The godlike Part of all Hearts, in its own Calm, sublime Pulse, the Life of all Things' Life! Such Thoughts came o'er me as I gazed up to The gathering Stars, that preach so eloquent The Wisdom and the Goodness of the Lord, And casting down mine Eyes I felt him there, There also in the Dayseye at my Feet: I saw no Littleness in it, for I Felt Him alone, and most in mine own Heart, Else could I not have seen him in that Flower: And therefore I could see no Littleness In it, for feeling Him, I was myself No longer little: thus attuned, I passed Into that Wood, as thro' a Temple vast, Where the Highpriest himself officiates In Person, and administers unto The Faithful that sublimest Sacrament, From Nature's own Communiontable, of The Bread, the spiritual Bread of Love And Life: and where can it so fitly be Received as at that Altar, by the Hands Of God himself administered to all! Around the foremost Trees were Creepers twined, And chrystalbunchÃ«d Grapes, lowdrooping with Their lipripe Nectarberries, in Festoons, As by the Fingering of Fairyhands, Closetwined, to form a rainproof Covering, Where Thunderdrops for half a Summersday Might patter, and not moisten on her Nest The Wren's Breastfeathers: underneath no Light Came from the peering Stars, save here and there Some Straybeam, falling with a Perfumelight, Thro' Honeyblooms and breezekissed Openings, On the Dewgrass below: or that soft Ray Of Spherelight, which the Firefly had stole, Betraying his bright Theft: the Nightingale's Soft Notes, like Dewdrops, fell on Blade and Leaf, Making them tremble light: and as I crushed The Perfumes in my Path, which made the Air Wingheavy as he crept from Bough to Bough, More sweetencumbered than a Noontidebee, I could distinguish, more by Smell than Sight, (Which left Imagination free to strew The Path at her own Choice, and from the Womb Of Darkness call dim Shapes of Loveliness) The Flowers, which, with every passing Breath, Breathed rich Intoxication: â then I caught The Babble of a neighbouring Brook, and soon, The Pathway opening up, I saw it gush, In beadÃ«d Bubbles and bright Waterbells, From out a deepmouthed Cave, whose shaggy Brows With the redberried Ash and Weepingbirch Were thicko 'ergrown: and soon it shot along Thro' chequered Shades, broadening into a Leap For the hothunted Stag, when baying Hounds Make Rock and Dingle echo in his Rear. With this my joyous Guide, I wandered on, As if eternal Nature, with her own Still Hand, had led me, and regained at length The open Ground, delighted and refreshed, As ever, by this Commune with herself, Whose Hand so oft had sprinkled on my Brow, The fresh, clear Dew, in Token of sincere Regeneration, as a Sign that I Was baptized to her Service thus once more! Her blessed Service, where the Fret of Heart And Fever of vain Hopes is calmed away: Her Ways of Innocence, in which we walk, 'Till of her mighty Heart the quiet Pulse Attunes our own: to that communicates Its own sublime Serenity, 'till naught, Naught more can trouble us! 'till evil Tongues, False Friends, Unthankfulness, and Hate, and Wrong, Grow like to Words without a Meaning, yea! Are such to us, for none can wrong us more, None injure, none provoke us, for we feel It not! esteeming it mere Folly to Disturb, for Things so measurelessly less Than it, the Soul! sublimely blind, we see No Loss where all Men see it, and therefore There is no Loss to us! God dwells in us, And who can injure Him? who rob him? none! And with Him what Loss can there ever be? VERSEOFFERINGS. Here, Reader, here are garnered up for thee, My first fresh Years of Youth: the Scent of those Pure Flowers of Love and Hope, which, like the Rose, Most fragrant ever in Lifesspringtide be. Chuse at thy Pleasure, haply thou mayst see Some little, modest Floweret which grows Unconscious of the Charm, to which it owes Thy Preference; and which perhaps, when the More gaudy ones are withered, shall not fade. For oft what in our Pride of Heart we made To witness for us, passes like a Thought, And that, which we ourselves esteemed as naught, Becomes the Theme of Praise, bursts from the Sha de, Like Violets, full of Nature's Perfume fraught! ON IMAGINATIONUSING. I do remember well the Day on which I wrought a Miracle, yet I had not Medea's Wand, or Archimago's Spell, I had them not, yet still less did I need; I wrought no Charm, I wove no mystic Words To pluck the Stars down from their orbÃ«d Spheres; I only thought: and lo! the Thing was done! A Wonderâ yet not wonderful, save to The Man who knows not what he is and has. I was in Sorrow, for the Grave had closed O'er one whom I much loved: I sat, and heard The Birds that sang so blithely, and I saw The Flowers unconscious of my Misery. And yet they soothed me, more, far more, than Words Of studied Consolation: for tho' they Are voiceless, yet they are a Language to Be felt, and God can speak as well by them, As by Man's Lip! and viewing them, I said, Â«Why do I weep when all around is Joy, Teaching in silent Wise the mighty Truth?Â» Is not Imagination mine? then why Should this sublimest of all Faculties Be left disused? this Faculty which is Health to the Sick, and Riches to the Poor, And unto him who will Eternity: Youth to Oldage, and everything to each, Who knows but how to use it, and believes, For without Faith there is no Miracle! I thought a little while, and he who thinks Deeply is far beyond the Reach of Pain, Withdrawn, like some far Star within the Depths Of the blue Ether, from the Storm below. A Tear, which had just gathered in my Eye, Fell on my Hand and roused me, and I looked Upon it almost with a Smile, and half- Surprized, scarce conscious whence it came from, said Â«What do'st thou here, sad Messenger of Grief, Who hast forgot to tell what thou wast bid, And now art free to bear a Message for What Master Chance may send thee?Â» and, methinks, Thou might'st do Wisdom better Service far! Go mingle with the Dewdrop on that Rose, Thus do I hallow thee to Joy, and give Thee back to Nature, even as my Soul Is mingled oncemore with this lovely Whole, Partaking of its Meaning and its Calm! Unconscious that the Shadow of a Grief Had rested on it, as the Sun, now from Yon' Cloud just passing, still and unobscured! I call the Dead from out their Graves, and kiss The Lips which now are cold, and by my Side Sit the belovÃ«d Forms of early Days, As they were wont to do. I still enjoy, In spite of Death, all that I once possessed: For all that we have felt, and thought, and loved, Abides with us, and in our Souls we build The lovelier World, which we enrich with all The Stores of our past Being, with all Forms Of Beauty, and all Sounds of early Joy: And like our Maker we have Power to say, Â«Let there be Light, and there is Light.Â» No Thing That ever has delighted us, is lost; The Hope which oft has made the Heart to throb, Will visit it again, yea, we ourselves Can realize it, tho' the outward Life Deny it a Fulfilment; we can fill The Heart with Joy by it, and how, how then Can it be better realized? for so Long as we hope, the Thing we hope for is A Joy to us: and tho' we have not it, Have we not all the Joy which it could give? And is not that the best Part of it? yea! It might be realized, and then that Joy Would be like to a Flower, whose rich Scent Had filled the Air afar, 'till drawing near We pluck and crush it in the little Space Of our poor mortal Hand, and for but one Brief Moment smelling it, behold it fade, Leaving the disenchanted Air forlorn, The cold, prosaic Breath of weekday Life! ON HIGHER APPLICATIONS OF MACHINERY 1. I see, as in a Dream, or on the Face Of a calm Lake, the Images most clear Of coming Wonders; Instruments appear Therein as glorified, which but of base Or lowly Ends as yet have borne the Trace, Unto the Body dedicate: but here They show like Weapons fashioned in the clear Fire of Heaven, to work out Deeds of Grace. That which in Mammon's Hand had wrought for no High End, in Wisdom's and Humanity's Becomes a mighty Lever. Light doth flow From the Smithsforge, and on his Anvil lies Metal soon fashioned for Truth's Victories, Far other than vain Sword and Spear; and lo! 2. Her Seeds, like Corn beneath the Plough, are sown: Amid the Oceanfurrows Tracks of Light By each Barkskeel are left, like Stars by Night Shooting athwart the Firmament: and down The viewless Winds her mighty Voice is blown Calling upon the Nations. â used aright The most familiar Means acquire Might Celestial: they operate alone Steadily, at all Times, all Places, on All Hearts, within the Reach of all, and by All comprehended; Wisdom's Hand upon All household Objects may impress some high Conception, and the Soul to Good be won E'en by the coarse Wants of Humanity; This is her Triomph: by the daily Eye And Heart she lasting Changes works alone! ON MONEYSEEKERS. By God! one Handfull of a Milton's Dust Were worth the Souls of all the modern Race Of Wealthadorers: one Look of his Face, Nay, e'en a Plastercopy of his Bust Placed in God's Temple, would from out it thrust With unendurÃ«d Frown, the Brood so base Of Moneychangers, to some fitter Place For their Abominations! but we must Be dumb as Stones! it is illbred, forsooth! To use plain Terms and speak the naked Truth, It shocks us! we are Dwarfsâmere Bastards, yea, Bastards in Soul, and mincingly we tread Where Gods have left their Footsteps; we must pay E'en for the Reverence we owe the Dead: We cannot near a Milton's Ashes stray To commune with his Spirit, without Gold! And at God's very Templedoor we're told The Price of our Admission! e'en the Ray Of his own Light is taxedâShame, Shame I say, How long must we endure that thus instead Of hevenly Things, vile Gold be worshippÃ«d? How many Knaves and Dotards buy their Way To the Statespinnacle, who 'neath should stay, Were Bags of Gold not sought, but Heart and Head! Ye Fools! if ye exalt such Men, will they Not sell ye like vile Sheep? but still your own Brute Vices scourge ye in them, yours alone! For were the Roots but sound, the Fruit would be Of generous Taste, and worthy of the Tree: Not rotten at the Core, as now we see! THE POETSHARP. The Strings with which the Poetsharp is made Are those of his own Heart, no Wonder then Its Music stirs so deep the Souls of Men, As tho' his Hand on their own Heartstrings played, And so it does!â And oh! how lightly swayed Are those selftrembling Chords, which thrill e'en when His Hand is sleeping, and wake up again Old Melodies, wild Music, which had strayed O'er them in bygone Days: for he scarce knows Himself whence comes the Spirit of his Lay: Oft 'tis aroused by some far Note, that flows From Angels hymning on the newborn Day; And like the Seashell is his Heart, for aye With living Sounds and Echos filled from those Far Spheres, to which he longs to soar away! REAL GOODS HOW EARNED? Life's genuine Goods by Rich and Poor are won In the same Fashion: they are neither bought With Gold nor go by Precedence, but wrought By our own Labour: nay, 'tis this alone That gives them Valueâ Patience must be shown In Bearing and Selfsacrifice, but naught Is harder practiced by, or rarer taught The Rich, than this, whose Minds in Ease have grown Enfeebled, dazzled by mere Shine and Show: Too many Goods are noneâ they are enjoyed Imperfectly, the Heart's not filled, but cloyed: They injure too that greatest Good, which no Infinitude of lesser Goods can e'er Supply the Place of, nay, these are not so Without that great Good, the Â«true Feeling, clear And godlike, of Man's Life!Â» which once destroyed, Then is the Compass lost, by which to steer All Action and Affection to fit End! For without this, we shall be apt, I fear, To set Life's Byaims above those which lend It all its Worth and Grandeur, and to make Th' Essential's Place the Accidental take: To merge the Â«ManÂ» in that which is but here The Mask and Mumming in which they appear, Or rather disappear, to speak aright! The Poor now is most likely to be quite Â«A Man,Â» for in him Heart and Feeling tend To rouse, and to keep steadily in View The grand and simple Duties, which delight A Spirit quite a wake, to Nature true. Then would the Richman win this Good, he too Must cast his Wealth away, which dissipates Life's Oneness, fritters it away, creates A Multiplicity of Details, where The one grand Feeling of this so, so fair Existence, is quite lost: 'tis like a Glass Shattered in Fragments, 'till the Form, which was Grand, whole, and godlike, can no more be there- In recognized: and since 'tis the full Light Of this same Feeling brings out clear to Sight, The Outline both of Man and God, if we Once lose it, we are no more Â«Men,Â» and he To us not God! he must from that lone Height Descend then to the Level of those who By common Wants of frail Humanity Keep sound the Heart by Contact, faithful to That Law which brings the Tear into the Eye, The divine Law of human Sympathy! For not to need our Fellowmen that is The worst Illâ thus from having naught to miss, We miss all, nay, grow a Nonentity! But if by casting Wealth away he grow Patient, what other Wealth needs he below? ON HOLYLIVING. Be pure, be good, be holy, for the more Thou art all this, the more shall all Things grow In Beauty to thine Eyes. let thy Soul be Like some calm Star that in its Orbit moves, Then shall the Harmony of this fair World Reveal itself to thee, for thou thyself Art then a Part thereof, else will it seem Confusion, for thy Being is confused. Respect thyself the most of all! and that Which thou before another wouldst not do Out of Regard to him, that do still less Before thyself, out of Regard to thine Own Self!âfor whom does it behove thee most To honor? thyself, and in thyself all Thy Fellowcreatures, or another, and Not thine ownself, and thereforeâ neither him! For he who honors not Man's Nature in The Abstract, and in his ownself, can ill Respect it in another! then respect Thyself, thus too in others' Presence thou Wilt seldom give Offence: and if in thy- Self thou respectest God who made thee in His Image, be assured thou wilt respect Him then in others tooâ admit no Thought Which thou wouldst not proclaim unto the Ear Of everyman: act always as if thy Breast were of Chrystal, and each Passerby Could read thy Feelings as he runs: and oh! Remember that there is one, to whose Eye It really is of Chrystal! stand thou then Always as in his Presence: then will thy Whole Being grow transparent, with his Light And Glory filled, like to a Diamond when Held up against the Sun!â seem what thou art, And be that which thou seem'st, then all may read What passes in thee, just as well as if Thy Bosom were of Chrystal: let thy Soul Be as a Telescope, thro' which thou mayst See shadowed forth the Forms of coming Things; Live in it, as already up with God In Heaven: feel Him in itâlet it be As a calm, clear, deep Water, giving back Life's changeful Forms, reflected in, but not Disturbing it: nay, borrowing from thence That Calmness, which seems foreign to themselves! Force not thy Thoughts or Feelingsâlet them spring Of themselves, like the Flowers of the Field, From natural Influence of Seasons, Times, And Circumstances, then will they be fresh, As are the Flowers, full of Life and Sap: A Light unto the Moment, in whose Soil They struck their Roots, and took their Colouring. Not like the cold Abstractions of dead Books, But springing from the Heart, and full of that Best Wisdom, in which all are wise, the pure, Deep Wisdom of Humanity and Love! LIFE. Oh! what were this Life if it did not lead To something better? how could we endure The Heartache and the Fever without Cure, Save from allhealing Death, if on a Reed, Shook by vile Chance's Breath, in this our Need We were compelled to lean? how far more poor Than the worst Beggar, if we were not sure That this our Hope is something more indeed Than a mere Fancy of the idle Brain! But that Conviction, springing as it does From Being's Depths, can pour in Spite of Pain Its sovereign Calm upon the Soul's worst Throes: Can quell rebellious Doubts, and place again Faith on her Throne secure from all her Foes! MOTHERSLOVE. What speaks of Heaven most on this dull Earth? What kindles in the Eye its holiest Ray? What is that Love which weareth not away With Years or e'en Neglect, that knows no Dearth, No base Alloy, no Stain of mortal Birth? That, bless'd and blessing, asks for naught, but aye Gives still more largely, and from each Outlay Of fond Affection reaps a Harvest worth The Revenue of Crowns? oh is it not A Mother's deep, unutterable Love, Of holiest Yearnings, fondest Hopes begot? All earthly Feelings and all Fears above, On its Snowpurity no smallest Spot, And in Excess itself naught to reprove Or wish away! who that has gazed once on A Mother and the Child she lulls to Rest, Bat feels his Nature beautified, his own Bes Sympathies awaked, as thro' his Breast Love's Hand above th' electric Chords had flown, Touching his inmost Being to its sweetest Tone! FREEDOM. All are not free Men whom the State makes so Or deigns to name so â can a paltry Space Of Earth or a vile Sum of Money place Within our Reach that precious Boon? oh no! Nor Gold nor Land release from Thralldom low; We may with these be Men whom Freedom's Face Would scorn to look on, who to Custom's base And palsying Yoke their Necks unmurmuring bow! We must be Citizens by divine Right Of a far other State than this, and by Far different Means! unto our Being's Height We must first rise by Truth, 'till that the Eye Be single, full of her celestial Light, And clear from Film of dull Mortality! WHAT SHOULD BE MOVEABLE AND WHAT IMMOVEABLE. Let Thought and Feeling be awake in thee, As lightlystirred as Leaves upon the Oak, In Sunshine quivering to the slightest Stroke Of Zephyr, or the Bird's least Breath: but be Thy Principles as firmset as that Tree On its deep Roots; that these, e'en when the Shock Of earthly Sorrow or of Ill have broke The Fruits of Promise, when they seemed to the Fond Eye of Hope sureripening, may still The Sap unto a nobler Growth supply, And with maturer Juice the Fruitage fill. And as towards Earth's Centre those Roots, by Which the Tree lives, still tend, so too let thy Deep Thoughts towards the Centreprinciple Of spiritual Gravitation bend, Thence draw still their Beginning and their End! ON A FRIEND ASKING IF HE DISTURBED ME WHEN WRITIN. 1. Oh! think not that thou interruptest me; A warm Shake of the Hand, a kindly Look, Inspire me more, far more than this dead Book, Which quickens not, by divine Sympathy, Those genial Affections which must be Cherished by daily Intercourse: I brook The simplest Sheepherd's Converse, who of Crook And Dog talks naively, better than to see That cold, dumb Oracle, Philosophy! I like to hear the Feelings of the Heart Speak, not in formal Phrases clipped by Art, But with the natural Eloquence of Eye And Voice, and Gest, which better can impart Wisdom than all the Books beneath the Sky. 2. In the pure Light of Things I love to stand, To see them as they are, nor more nor less; I need no spectacles of books t'impress Or magnify the wonders of God's hand. I with my natural sight have ever scanned His Volume, comprehended it far more By my own Heart's plain Comment, and the Lore Of pure delight, than by all that the band Of Pedants and of Sages ever penned! Then fear not that thy voice disturbs me, Friend; It tunes my thoughts, like pleasant chimes they fall In order, and a healthy glow thereby My cold Abstractions warms: and after all, This is real Life, that is but Poesy! And Life the highest Poesy I call! SLAVERY. Firstborn of Sin and Darkness, Slavery! How shall I name thee, Foe to all that's good? Thou that canst change the Spirit's vital Blood To Poison â where does thy true Power lie? Thy petty Hate may dim the Body's Eye, And wear the Flesh, but the Mind's constant Mood Can shake not; nay, such Woes by Faith withstood, Feed but the Lamp of Immortality: And from Earth's Hopes, returning to their Dust, Spring up the Fruits of spiritual Life! 'Tis in the Heart subdued to Sin and Lust. Of all real Ill ourselves the Seeds have nursed, By our Cooperation they grow rife: Ill is to us so thro' our ownselves first! And the Selfslave of all Thralls is the Worst; What boots a Body free, a Mind with Truth at Strife? THE WIND. Poet! what Poet's Strains can vie with thee, Thou manytonÃ«d Wind, whom all the Strings Of Harmony obey; when Thunder rings 'Round some hoar Mountain's Brows, there wilt thou be, (While Echo sets the old Cavevoices free From their Rockslumbers,) with thy mighty Wings Sweeping the headlong Waterfall that flings Himself in Air's Embrace: and when the Sea Tunes all his Waves from Pole to Pole in one Worldfilling Concert, art not thou alone The Masterspirit of the Minstrelsy? Yet canst thou mould thy Voice unto a Tone Soft as in Woman's Ear the whispered Sigh Of Love, for all sweet Things fit Company! MONEYCOVETERS. How many sweat and toil for thee, how many Seek thee from Day to Day, and Year to Year, As the sole Good that Life can offer here, Letting thee drop at last reluctantly From Age's palsied Grasp! and when the high And blessed Hour of Freedom draweth near, When the prophetic Sight has Glimpses clear Of Glories inexpressible, caused by Some Angel's Hand uplifting partially The aweful Veil, still unto thee they cling, With one Foot in the Grave, and drag thee down With them into it, tho' the Weight must bring Damnation on their Souls: still Mammon's own Vile Thralls, when Heaven itself is opening! TIMESUSE. Pay all thy Debts, first what to God is due, Then canst thou owe to no Man anything! Then shall the Earth and all her Voices sing Sweet Music to thine Ear, and Spring shall strew For Age her Flowers as when Life was new! Be not closehanded, wisely mayst thou fling Thy Bread upon the Waters, Time will bring All back with Interest: for what unto His Care Man trusts, thereof he loses naught, But, like an Usurer, with Joy or Pain He pays each Moment surely back again, According as 'twas spent: by Wisdom wrought Into the Substance of eternal Gain, Or still by Folly deemed a mere Sandgrain! INNOCENCE. Oh cherish in thy Heart a Nook where ne'er The cold World's Strife may enter, where of Peace The still, low Voice of Conscience may not cease To whisper still unto the inward Ear, Serene and ample, and awake to hear Voices from other Days, that come again, To teach us that our Yearnings are not vain: Echos from other Worlds and Answers clear! Alas for him who in Misfortune finds No Comforter in his own Bosom, who Has forfeited his Birthright: Conscience winds, Snakelike, around his Heart, she, who should strew With Joys the Path, him as a Bondslave binds To Pain, still to her double Office true! LAMENT. Oh! that a Milton would rise up once more To lay his Hand on the old Harp, again To wake the Music of past Days, the Strain Which, like Spheremelody, from Shore to Shore Passed o'er the Nations, making in its Power The Thrones of Tyrants tremble, nor in vain! Alas! we are are but Dwarfs, we cannot strain Our weak Grasp to the Strings! the Days are o'er When Sagespen and Poetsharp could wake The World from out its Lethargy; we have Naught of that antique Flame which erst could make Menslips like Angels' eloquent, which gave The Faith that, looking still beyond the Grave, Life's godliest Prospect from its Brink could take! POVERTY. Oh God! it is a soulsupporting Thought, To think that ever the more poor we be, The richer in all genuine Wealth are we, If we have but the calm Belief that naught Life yields has Value, save as it be wrought To fitting Use and Application by That shaping Spirit which within doth ply Its godlike Office! save as we be taught By it to see that all Things take their Worth From our ownselves, yea, even from the Way In which we look at them! this ample Earth At one Man's Feet its ample Stores will lay, While of all inward Good another's Dearth Deprives him even of the Light of Day! MYSTIC POETRY. 1 There is a Poesy where Words do seem Like Hieroglyphics to the practiced Eye, A Shorthandwriting with fit Imagery Penned as by Angelshands, or with the Beam Of living Truth enwoven; words that teem With grand and lofty combinations, high And sweet suggestions, signs and tokens, by Which we can piece the fragments of some dream Of Beauty, and fill up the outline clear Of the dim vision veiled in its own Bright- Ness, which from time to time our dull path here Crosses, then vanishes again from Sight, Halfconscious Recognitions from a sphere To which we tend as flowers to the Light! 2 But this is Poetry which he alone, Whose soul is pure, can comprehend, whose mind The perfect Beauty in itself can find, And concentrate the scattered rays of one Eternal Truth, whereever they have shone Upon it, in one Socket, where enshrined, Like to a living Eye among the blind, The blessed radiance, glancing ever on All objects, shows them in their genuine Light. The Wisdom which is not of Earth, whose Sight Is single, calm and serene, and whereby, Through Hope and Faith, he looks beyond this Night, These changeful Mists of Time, and in his Eye Receives the Light of Immortality! 3 But to the worldly soul these words have no Deep meanings, give no Intuitions clear, No glimpses far into the life which ne'er To chance and change is subject: but like to The poor skygazing Savage, it can know Naught of the wheels of Harmony which bear The starry chariots thro' the silent air, While on the other Heaven's least star can throw The radiance of all, and lead him on, From orb to orb, thro' all the Galaxy, From link to link, yea! even to the throne Of God himself! for to his ample Eye Earth's meanest flower or that one star alone Are signs and tokens of Infinity! 4 The least sandgrain on the seashore is fraught To him with wonder, and it speaks as well As the loud Ocean: is a miracle As great as any in the old times wrought For those who in their souls had never sought The miracle of miracles, to quell All Doubts; that most incomprehensible God in our Breasts, who grapples with proud Thought, As with a babe, and flings him back to Earth, When without Faith he would investigate The mystery that hovers o'er Man's birth; For Faith and Thought to Wisdom's rich Estate Are Coheirs, Twins in Heaven they were, and so No perfect Being when divided know! 5 There is no Littleness to him who sees God in all Things; nay, often that which is Despised as insignificant, in his Esteem is but more wonderful: Degrees Of Wisdom unobserved he marks, by these Goes deep and rises high, still fixing sure Each Spoke of Truth's vast Wheel, 'till it endure The Weight of the whole Universe; where cease The Stare and Wonder of the World, there he Is lost most in Astonishment and Awe: Amid the Chaos and the ceaseless War Of human Passions, it is his to see These jarring Elements, by one grand Law, Made Parts of Nature's boundless Harmony! HOW TO MAKE BEING COMPACT. Why is the Wheel so strong? a Child knows why! Because the Spokes towards one same Centre tend, Which combined Strength to each and all doth lend. So let God be the Centre of all thy Life, Thoughts, and Deeds: and if unceasingly They flow from him, to his sole Glory bend Their Energies, and constantly ascend For Motive and for Sanction to the Sky, Then will thy Life, all Parts thus knit in one, Be firm and compact! and what is this whole Vast World but such a Wheel? of which, as on In ceaseless Agitation it doth roll, And all is Change, that which we stand upon, And we ourselves, unchanging he alone Is the unshaken Centre and the Soul! THE POET'S LAMP. What matters it, tho' to the godlike Toil My Health, nay, even Life itself must be Offered, the Price of Immortality? Let no low Thought the Sacrifice then soil; The Poet's Lamp is nourished not with Oil, Gross and material, like that which we Employ the Labour of our Hands to see, When busy with low Cares and Life's Turmoil, But with the purest Naptha of the Soul: Purer than that which from the Stars doth shine: And kindled first by Truth, with her divine And quenchless Torch, it lights him to the Goal: To the great Spirit of this lovely Whole Burning like Lamp before the inmost Shrine! ON USING THE PRENENT. 1. Live thou each Day as if 'twere thine alone, Then wilt thou of its Worth become aware: Then wilt thou too enjoy it in its fair Reality, and learn when it is gone How great has been thy Gain: for to live one, One signle Day without a Touch of Care 'Bout Past or Future, is to be as are The Birds and Flowers, who have never known A Morrow or a Yesterday: the Hour Which passess leaves alone the precious Dower Of Life: it yields enough to exercise All Faculties, and calls for all our Power To draw forth all its Good, and realize The golden Vein which unworked therein lies! 2. For Time to us is but as Marble to The Sculptor's Hand, and as he in this wakes The sleeping Statue, and the coarse Block takes, Beneath his Touch, the Shape which it should do, So we call forth the Beautiful, the True, And Godlike from the other. He who rakes 'Mid the spent Ashes of past Pleasures, makes The Present useless, and 'tis only thro' This that he can move onwards, or attain Life's Goalâ what boots it to live o'er again The Past? the Past has served its End, 'tis gone, And wherefore should the springtide Tree retain Its withered Autumnleaves, and not put on The living Beauty of the passing Hour? The green, the ripe Fruit, must succeed the Flower, Each is a Step linked with the former one; Man's Course is onward, yet to dream upon The Future also is unwise: for by The intermediate Steps we reach alone Its Blessings; nay, there is no Future, none, Without the Present! Life is as a Chain, Each Part linked with the other viewlessly: Oft fine as Gossamer, yet by the Eye Of Wisdom traced, and no least link is vain, In their Connection lies their only Power; The intermediate Steps alone prepare And fit us to receive the Goods which are Still distant, else perhaps a Source of Pain, Nay, Curses! to the feeble Child what were Man's Strength of Reason but a Curse? gray Hair Which Manhood has not fitted us to wear? Then live the Present, this alone can be Clasped to the Heart, substantial, solid Bliss; Past, Future, are but Shadows, cleave to this! RICHES. 1. He who has least, has mostârichest with nought Beyond Life's grand and simplest Goods, an Eye Not easydazzled with vain Glitter, high Yet sober Feeling of what this Life ought To beâa loving Heart, a Spirit taught On Nature's solid Ground to build up, by The firm Materials of Reality, Its Happiness, not by vain Fancy wrought From airy Nothings, but substantial Bliss: Bliss to be pressed unto the human Heart By which we live, thereunto to impart That daily Warmth of human Love, which is God's chosen Altarflame; for know, thou art Not yet a Man, unless thou liv'st by this! 2. He who has most is poorest, for he goes Not into his ownself enough, to find His Happinessâfor still from our own Mind Must it be fashioned forth, and with the Throes Of our own Heart must it have Birth, like those Which to the poorest Mother's Bosom bind The Child of her own Womb, and make her blind To all that it may want; see what Love does, The Beautifier! he who makes this so, So rude, imperfect World more lovely than The Hues by Raphael thrown above the Brow Of his Madonna!â all that Riches can Teach us, is in ourselves this Truth to know, That they are needless to be Â«quite a ManÂ»! 3. They loose the Sinews of our Industry, Make Purpose faint, and Execution slow, Religion a mere Form, impelled on no Unwearied Wing of Faith towards the Sky, But glancing still, with dull and filmy Eye, On those bless'd Words, which no true Meaning show 'Till quickened into Life by holy Glow Of Feeling; in our bitterest Misery They first shine forth with their celestial Light. And oh! methinks, it were worth while to be A Beggar by the Road, to feel aright The Force of that divinest Prayer, as we Should do, Â«our Father which art in HeavenÂ», see Thy Child, and keep him ever in thy Sight: Â«Thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done on Earth As 'tis in HeavenÂ»! and if thou feel'st the Worth Of these few words, then to thee straightway his Kingdom will be already come, and Bliss Will fill thy Heart, and flow from it, as flows The Perfume from the summeropening Rose! And if his divine Will be done in thee As up in Heaven in the Angels, He Will enter into thee, and thou, like those, Wilt be a perfect Angel, blessed as they! Tho' thou hast not a stone, whereon to lay Thy Head, yet thou shalt sleep so sweetly, yea! Such Sleep as Wealth on pillowed Down ne'er knows; In God's own Bosom shalt thou sleep, and o'er Thy Head shall Visions of the Blessed play, Life's bitter Breath thou shalt not breathe of more, But Ether, and be served upon thy Way By Spirits, still obedient to thy Sway! LIFEKNOWLEDGE. Experience and Worldwisdom! oh how dear They cost us, these same vaunted Treasures! how Many sweet Streams of Fancy cease to flow, How many Gushings of the Heart grow sere, How many Flowers must be withered, ere, Creatures of Form and Custom, we can bow And smile, and play our Parts in this vain Show, Where no Love is! 'till we have schooled our Ear And Eye, and checked the Beatings of the Heart, So that it no more throb, e'en tho' the Theme Were God and Freedom! can we not redeem Our Souls from this worst Thralldom, or must Art, And Form, and Custom, mould us 'till we seem Automatons, Machines in every Part! RAPTURESTEARS. Oh! blessed Tears, come once more to may Eyes, That, glittering thro' you, I may see all Things As beautiful as tho' an Angel's Wings Had dropped the Heavensdew, fresh from the Skies, Upon them once again; the Glory dies Which Youth and Hope breathed on the Earth: the Strings, By Time too rudely touched, their Minist 'rings Unto Hope's Hand refuse! in vain it tries The wonted Chords, it can call forth at best But Chimes of jangled Music, which too well, By what they are not, to the sad Heart tell How much is wanting; but when from your Rest, Ye Tears, ye start, at Joy, th' Enchanter's, Spell, Seen thro' ye Earth as erst seems fair and blest! LAMENT. My Heart is sad, and my Harpstrings have grown Weary of this eternal Theme of Woe; Oh that some good old Song might wake e'en now The Spirit which so long from them has flown! My Hand is heavy, and its Touch is thrown Reluctantly athwart them, for they know No Voice but what from blank Despair doth flow, Their Mirth is forced, and turns into a Moan! And if the blessed Music of old Days Come back by Fits unto the Strings, it finds No Ears that comprehend its Wisdom, Minds Whose Music is the Clink of Gold: it plays Like wandering Minstrel from some far Countree, Who finds all strange where his dear Home should be! NONE need BE POOR. 1. Had we but that which really here below Is ours, how poor then would the Beggar be? But, with a little Fancy, all we see, As far as the Enjoying it can go At least, may be made ours; and who so Truly the real Possessor then as he Who draws most Good from it? a Thing to the Richman may be as if 'twere not, of no Value or Use, it charms no more his Eye, Because fastidiousâ but if thou quietly Walk'st thro' his Field, and view'st it as thine own, Pleased with it as it is, if it were thy Own really, wouldst thou then possess it one Jot more? 'tis no more his, but thine alone! 2. So walk thou thro' this lovely World, this Hall Of Wonders, as if thou wert Lord of all: Mar not thy Pleasure by the Wish to be So in Name too: the Fruit is tinged for thee With Gold and Purple, and the Flowers spring Beneath thy Feet to give thee Welcoming! Think that all, all is good, nor fancy aught Could better be, and then there will be naught To be made better: all will perfect grow, If thou enjoy'st it perfectly, with no Vain Retrospects, nor Hopes of greater Bliss: The greatest, if thou art but wise, is this Which thou now tastÃ«st, for it fits thy Mind For greater, in that Fitness thou wilt find Not one Joy, but all Joys summed up in one: As on the Instrument in perfect Tone All Music which its Compass can comprize May be performed: thus in thy human Soul The Harmonies of this so boundless Whole, Tho' on a smaller Scale, yet still, if wise, Unutterably sweet, thou mayst epitomize: 'Till, in somesort like God's, thy human Heart Grow as the Whole, pervading every Part! TO WONDERSEEKERS. Yea! Miracles are wrought (and none shall make Me change my Faith) by common Agencies! The dovelike Glance shot from a Maiden's Eyes Its stubborn Purpose from the Soul can take, And bid it to its inmost Centre shake, When Thunders, bellowing thro' th' affrighted Skies, Would find it calm: herein we recognize A Power, ever jealously awake Within the human Soul, there to maintain Of divine Things the due Supremacy: These hold Communication, and reply By Means which Sense would penetrate in vain, Godlike to Godlike speaking, and still by The Spirit Spirit loving to constrain! WORLDWEARINESS. Ye good old Thoughts, once more upon the Ear Of sober Contemplation, long stunn'd by The Jar, the Noise, and manyvoicÃ«d Cry Of this loud Babel, steal ye with the clear, Sweet Chimes of other Days, with Fancies dear, Dearer from Interruption: with all high And blest Associations be ye nigh To soothe the Soul, that it again may hear The calm, eternal Voice discoursing sweet Music of Things beyond the Reach of Chance And Change, there where no busy Sound of Feet Toiling in Mammon's dusty Paths, no Glance Of Avarice or wrinkled Vice, may meet The Ear or Eye, to break that blessÃ«d Trance! WISDOM. Methinks I would not paint thee with grey Hairs And a thoughtfurrowed Brow! I rather would Give thee a Child's young Heart, and bid thy Blood Dance joyously, unchecked by Life's dull Cares! Is not Bliss Wisdom? if then Wisdom wears Pain's Livery, it is a sorry Mood, Hard Service and worse Wages! Wisdom's Food Is joyous Thoughts, and with these she repairs The Injuries of Time: a wayside Flower, A passing Cloud, can make her happier Than Mammon's Darling 'mid his hoarded Ore! And if in this so troubled World her Hour Of Grief she too must feel, she has a Lore Can make its Bitterness more sweet to her, Than e'en Prosperity to those who know Not its true Use, nor whence its Blessings flow! LAMENT. Shame on ye! dull, cold Hearts, who seek to gain, By Prostitution of celestial Thought, The Wages of vile Mammon! ye have brought Divine Things into Disrepute, made vain The Sage's Labours, to the Poet's Strain Untuned our Ears, 'till we are fit for naught, In Thought or Action, with true Grandeur fraught: 'Till we no longer comprehend the plain And blessed Gospeltruths, but mouthe them o'er With Apegrimaces, like the Pharisees: Vain Forms and Ceremonies, where no more Aught quickening survives pure Faith's Decease! Alas! our Hearts are rotten to the Core, And the Lifeblood there stagnates thro' Disease! GOLD. I value thee but even as thou art In Wisdom's Sight, yet thou too mayst be made The Minister of generous Thoughts, and aid The nobler Beatings of the human Heart In thy brute Fashion! Wisdom can impart Even to thee, so oft to vain Parade By Folly's unreflecting Hand betrayed, High Uses, and by her discerning Art Reedem thee from the Dust! but shouldst thou e'er With Feelings, Thoughts, and Hopes, of divine Birth, Into Collision come, with Things that ne'er Have bowed themselves from their celestial Worth To thy lowthoughted and changetroubled Sphere, I tread thee down into thy kindred Earth! TO MY MOTHER. I would not rashly lift the Veil which lies Upon thy Face, my Mother! lest below, Tooclose examining, I learn to know E'en in those Features, holy to my Eyes, Our coarse and common Clay! past Times arise, When the Heart's first Affections for thy Brow That Veil of Reverence wove, with Thoughts which grow Only in early Years, with blessÃ«d Ties And high Associations: it is long Since we have met, and thou may 'st no more be The same whom I so loved! thou dost belong To a bright Dream, and should Reality, As he is wont, approach it but to wrong, Who shall restore me what I lose in thee? Then wear it stillâ thus shalt thou to me seem Life's best Reality, andâ fairest Dream! At once Life's most real Good, and what of best The Fancy has, and of idealest! A PRAYER. The ardent Thirst hast thou not granted me, Oh God! and wilt thou not accord me too Wherewith to quench it? some few Drops of Dew Celestial, from that richfruited Tree Whereon all Knowledge grows, eternally Watered by Truth's pure Fountain, and brought to Me in an Angel's Palm, enjoined to strew My Lips with that bless'd Moisture, 'till they be Fit for the Utterance of divine Thought. Far other Inspiration than was known To Grecian Bard, tho' by the Muse 'twas brought Descending visible, e'en such as on The Harp of David its high Wonders wrought, Whose Spirit down from Heaven direct had flown! FAME. 1. I thought I should be happy, if the Wreath Of Fame might but for once o'ershade my Brow, But I have learnt from others' Fate to know My Error, for the Pulse still throbs beneath Those idle Laurels, and the withering Breath Of Disappointment not the less doth blow Upon our Hopesâ alas! it is not so Real Happiness is won: these Joys to Death Are offered up, like Flowers on the Grave! A more substantial Bliss the Heart doth crave: Life was not meant to be a Dream, and we Abuse that divine Gift of Fancy, save When we employ its sublime Agency To raise the Real by Hope of Things to be! 2. For this End was Imagination made Our Heritage, that we therein a Sign Might have of Birth and Destiny divine: That still as from Life's flowers the bloom should fade, And narrower grow our Cares, by its bless'd Aid We might enlarge our Realm: o'erstep the Line Within which Life's vain Sorrows would confine, And see the Promiseland before us spread, Wider and wider, like the growing Day. The bitterest punishment that falls on those Who worship Mammon, is the sure Decay Of Fancy: she her glorious wings must close, And no more soar up for the divine Ray, To feed Faith's Altar burning fast away. ON MINGLING WITH LOW NATURES. What can the Contact with vile Natures do To disennoble one that is divine? Some Freshness at the Surface it may tine, The frank Reliance, the Belief, which drew From its own Nobleness its sublime View Of Life: awhile into the inner Shrine, To purer Worship, loftier Design, The Spirit may retire, to renew Its Purpose, and to gather Energy, But for this, its first Disappointment, by The Oracle consoled, returns again To Life, and works with tenfold Industry The Good and Godlike for their own Sakes! for True Gold, tho' rubbed, remains without a Flaw, Gold in all Shapes and Uses 'neath the Sky: But the mere surfacegilded can retain Its Lustre only while not tested: when By base Materials rubbed, it changes, or By Contact grows like them insensibly! THE HOMELESS. 1 Hark! 'tis but the sere Leaf which makes Me with its Footfallmotion start, Like to a guilty Thing that shakes, As all were not right at the Heart. 2 The same Star now is overhead, Which so oft on my Boyhood shone, As homeward sent to guide my Tread, Alas! where does it now lead on? 3 I know not â 'tis not to my Home; The Home I seek is very far, Farther than whence yon' calm Beams come, Yea! up above yon 'still, fair star! 4 Oh Eveningstar, that leadÃ«st now, Unto the household Hearth so dear, So many Hearts, oh how, oh how, Canst thou forget me mourning here? 5 Mine Eyes are dim at Sight of thee, My feet mechanically move, Thou draw'st me on resistlessly, Softbeaming like the Eyes I love. 6 Ah cruel Star, why wilt thou cheat Me with this Dream of Things longpast, Home has no Threshhold for my Feet, No Warmth is from that Hearth now cast! 7 Thou art but a mere Star to me, Like those that near thee coldly shine, The Home, that gave the Charm to thee, Is gone, and thou no more divine! 8 They tell me even on thy fair, Calm Silverdisk, that Night and Day Alternate, and that Sorrow there Too claims o'er human Hearts his Sway. 9 Then roll thou on thro' boundless Space, The Home I seek is not in thee, My Heart would find a Restingplace, The long Rest of Eternity! LIFE. How often, seated in my Armchair, by The Fireside, with, save its fitful Blaze, No other Light, have I mused o'er the Ways Of God, as they have been revealed in my Own Life, for 'tis this Revelation I Have drawn most Comfort from, this to the Maze Has lent a Clueâ our own Heart is the Place Where we may best consult him: evernigh The Oracle is ready at our Call, And if we but do or forego what it Bids or forbids, our Feet will seldom fall Into the Snareâ what other Men have writ Instructs us: but the Comment best of all, For us, is that of our own Heartsâ when lit By their Light, then the perplexed Page grows clear, For none can tell us what we are or were! TO THE DAISY. Flower, that in the Soil of Memory Growest, whose Roots with mine own Heart seem knit, As tho' they sprang and took their Life from it, Fed by its Yearnings, would that I could see Naught but a little careless Flower in thee, Upon whose Leaves the bygone Hours have writ No Records, thus to make me by thee sit With glistening Eye, and con the History Of Joys, which sprang at every Step, like thy Sweet self! why from the cold, forgetful Earth Dost thou shoot up thus unconcernedly? Spring sees thee with each Year renew thy Birth: Yet art thou no more to my saddened Eye The outward Emblem of an inward Mirth! THE EVENINGSTAR. Homestar of Eve! with what a lovefull Eye Must the poor Labourer look up at thee, When, all his Daytoils ended, he doth see Thee shining o'er his Cot, so calm and high! O'er that dear spot, from the World's Vanity, From all its brute Uproar and Turmoil, free; What Bliss is his, when, dandling on his Knee, To his least Babe he sings its Lullaby! But to the Richman that fair Star is nought, It sweetens not the Sweat upon his Brow: It is no Herold unto him of aught That hallows still alike both high and low, It has no beauty for him, brings no thought Of Joys that from wise toil, their Springhead, flow! FREEDOM. Tho' thousands call on thee, fair Liberty, And with thy hallow'd name on their false tongue, Work deeds of crime and blood: tho' often sung By Hirelingbards, who prostitute their high And holy Calling, for the Wreaths that die, Ere Fame's vile Reek be past, yet ne'er among Thy servants nam'st thou these: for strife and wrong, The visible Powers which work their Victory With Steel, and Nerve, and Sinew, and brute Might, Thou, knowing whence Strength is and what, dost scorn! Thine are allbloodless Conquests, calm as bright, For Liberty and Virtue were twinborn; Thine make man Master of himself, for he Whose State is selfdivided is not free! CHARITY. Sweet is the smallest Act of Charity As a foretaste of Heaven, worth, I weet, Eternities of vulgar bliss: 'tis sweet To have some quiet nook of memory, Where, like a bright glimpse of the glad blue sky Amid surrounding clouds, our gooddeeds greet The back ward glance with blessings; can Wealth bring, Pomp, Power, or Pride, a Balm unto the Smart Of stinging Conscience? no, their utmost art A veil o'er hidden pangs at best can fling. They never toil in vain who serve aright The Giver of all Good, who truly seek His Glory, not their own: tho' Fortune wreak Her wayward Spleen on them, they find a Light E'en in their very darkness, and a Might Beyond Earth's strength; for man is then most weak When he would stand alone, and if he break From Virtue and Selfcontrol, 'tis to bite The dust of which he's made in Selfdespite! HAPPINESS. Oh! Happiness, how few who seek thee, find Thy priceless blessing, not that on life's tree Of manytasted fruits, the true one be Above the feeblest reach, but that with blind And thoughtless haste we pluck; it is the mind, Whose pruned or unpruned Wishes set us free From Earth's worst cares, or turn to mockery The Gifts we covet most; the tempting rind Hides bitter ashes: Wisdom hath no power To make us happy, if it teach not how To draw enjoyment from the passing hour; The simplest hind from his despisÃ«d plough Reaps more than all Ambition's princely dower, From our own breasts, all Good or Ill doth flow! WISDOM. Whig, Tory, 'tis all one! true Wisdom knows Naught of Distinctions varying with Place, With Times and Prejudices, nor to base And selfish Partyends perverts she those Eternal Cares and Duties which she owes Unto Mankind at large. She views the Race, But higher Things therein doth ever trace, Than those engaged in it strive after, whose Exertions are but for themselves: like to The Rat in Wisdom, just enough to do As it, to leave the Building e're it fall, But not repair it duringly for all That's precious in Man's Heritage, a Store For them and others, thus made tenfold more. She swears not by a Name, her Sympathies Are catholic â her Eye is single, clear, Looking before and after, like a Seer, Unto the Heart of Things â she doth despise The Watchword of a Sect, the Badge of Clan, Her Party is Mankind, her Watchword, Â«Man!Â» Then be ye wise, thus straightway shall ye know Your Answer, and to which Side ye should go! REAL WEALTH. 1. The daily Use of what we have alone, The actual Consciousness thereof, that is Our genuine Wealth: grasping at more we miss E'en what we have â a Thing is then our own When it is present to the Mind â when known And felt, it first contributes to our Bliss; Too many weaken but eachother â his Enjoyment, who has many Goods of one Same Kind, can scarce be greater than his who Has one alone: by Repetition he Gains naught, nay loses! one Rose smells like two Or three, for one by one still must they be Enjoyed â and one small Room is worth to thee A Palace, nay! if content is one too! And haply far, far more, it is thy â Home! The Heaven from which thy Wishes never roam; A godlike Palace! for God is there, and Where He dwells, who lives better in the Land? 2. But what now are those Goods which we most have The daily Use of? our own Faculties, Thoughts and Affections, from their Exercise Springs all real Wellfare: do not then deprave Them from their true Direction â if we crave Life's Tinsel and vain Show, how can we prize Aright its solid Goods?â our Sympathies Should tend to godlike Things, and by these brave The Shocks of Suffering, like Ivy twined Around the Oak:â the Wealth of his own Mind The poorest Man can have the Use of, yea! More than the Richest: and therein may find A Treasure everpresent. which from Day To Day still multiplies, as 'neath their Sway His true Affections bring Life's Forms, and bind Them to the Heart enduringly for aye, With Tendrils strong of Love, from the Springhead Of natural Affection ever fed! HEAVEN'S VISITATIONS. God's Gifts to us are perfectâ it is we Who, by receiving them improperly, Do make them otherwiseâ it is the Eye Of Faith, in each of Life's Events, must see Their Uses, and the Good which thence may be Extractedâ E'en in Pain and Misery God wills our Good: let Patience then stand by The Sickbed, yea! the Deathbed too, for she Is Life's best ministering Angel, and Sole Healer! Thou receivest at her Hand More than Misfortune takes, a Foretaste of That Heaven, which is to thee no more above, But round thee, in thee! for if thou hast got So far to be content with any Lot, To say with heartfelt Gratitude and Love, Â«Thy will be done on Earth as 'tis in Heaven,Â» Then unto thee that Heaven will be given; For but to do His Will on Earth, that is In its sole Self, the Sum of Heaven's Bliss! Then thankfully receive the Gifts he sends, Whate'er they be; according to the Ends Which thou direct'st them towards, will they prove good Or evil: but which of these two they should Be turned to, that on thy sole Self depends! For costliest Blessings, when received amiss, Are none, and Sorrows give an Angelskiss Of Peace to such as meet them in fit Mood! ON A LYREBEARING APOLLO. And hear'st thou not the Music? are not those The very Notes that floated on the Ear Of blind Meonides, to whose so clear, Inspiring Sound his full Heart sank and rose, With Beatings mightier than Ocean knows? See, see, the Etements take Shape, and near The God, departed Forms of Beauty rear Themselves to Sight! a Temple yonder shows Its gleaming Marbles thro' the antique Trees, Beneath whose Boughs, lightstirrÃ«d by the Breeze, A Band of Maidens o'er the new Grass speed; Oh happy Vision! which with so much Ease I have called forth from nothing, what we need We make ourselves, and do become indeed! GRAVECHUSING. 1 Oh! Father, let me buried be In yon 'sweet Churchyardnook, Beneath the shadowy old Yewtree, Hardby that pleasant brook: 2 Its voice, tho' I shall hear it not, Makes music very meet For that same calm and quiet spot, The injured's last retreat. 3 It is a song of early days: Snatches of happy times Still meet my ear, as on it plays, But too like jangled chimes. 4 And let there be no stone above To tell its idle tale, But freshest turf with flowrets wove, And perfuming the gale, 5 For I should wish no curious eye To know who I have been, The few who love me, easily Will find the spot I ween: 6 And let there be no ruder sounds Than greet the dawning day, The voice of that sweet stream, which bounds So merry on its Way. 7 Let children sport above my grave, And pluck the flowers there, Enjoying, as I myself have, Those hours so fresh and fair, 8 Let them not think on whom they tread, The silence that's below, But laugh as tho' there were no Dead, And Life were ever so! 9 These tremblingvoicÃ«d words had brought A tear into her eye, For still it is a bitter thought So very young to die. 10 Then from her father's breast she raised Feebly her sinking head, One moment in his face she gazed, Yet not one word she said. 11 There was a something at her heart That could not uttered be, She pressed his hand, as those who part For an Eternity. 12 He answered not, there came no tear, He clasped her to his breast, He listened for awhile to hear Her heart, but 'twas at rest! 13 And when I pass'd again that way, The birds were singing there, As tho' there had been no such day, Nor man e'er felt despair. 14 I wandered thro' the churchyardnook, The stream was flowing on, All things wore just the selfsame look, Save one small spot alone. 15 A little mound of turf was there, Which was not there before, No other mark to point out where Slept she who was no more! 16 The old yewtree its shadows threw Upon that humble sod, And on its breast the flowers grew, Emblems of trust in God. 17 And thus we pass away, and leave No void in the vast chain Of Being, and scarce one will grieve Or think of us again. 18 Our name is cast upon the winds, Our memory is gone, And all the curious searcher finds At best is a gravestone. 19 Ask of this manycenturied tree Who sleeps beneath his shade, Will Nature, think'st thou, answer thee? She cares not for the dead! MAN. Hast thou not given us the eye to see, The ear to hear, and spread before our eyes This glorious World of beauty, Earth, Sea, Skies, With all their rich and rare variety Of soulawaking charms? yet we pass by, Tho' wonders at each heedless step arise, As men who had no hearts! Mercy, allwise, Allbounteous God: chastise, but let it be In Love not Wrath, reclaim us to thy ways. We are but lipfree, our worst fetters are In our own souls: baser no tyrant lays On his least thrall, than who with self at war, And with his being's end, can pass his days, A selfchained captive to vile Mammon's car! AMBITION. Ambition, like the kite, will soar full-high, Yet are his heart and ken still downward bent, His base prey's still beneath him, most intent On that when highest soaring; Folly, by A little gilded Dust thrown in his Eye, Makes a mere Crown seem a bright Halo sent By Glory's self to wreath his brows; the tent, Where like a God he sits, th' Idolatry Of foolÃ«d hosts, blind tools and framed aright For such a hand, the shout, the feast, the fight, The bloodstained triomph, such the Steps that bear Ambition to his selfo' erbalanced height, Whence, on his Earth-Olympus, he will scare With his Claythunderbolts, to vulgar sight A Godâ and most fit too, for such as make Their Deity of Clay, and consecrate In him their selfscourged Sins: but drowsy Hate, Drugged by Oppression, shall at length awake, And the vain Momentsidol rudely break, Hurled to the Dust from whence capricious Fate Had raised him! of the Virtue of a State Its Rulers give the Measureâ for they take Their Measure from it: this is the sole true Thermometer, which sinks and rises too As Good or Evil may preponderate In that great Mass, whence it the Impulse drew. Vices must rise, when pressed up by the Weight Of those beneath, and sink just as these do! PHILOSOPHY. 1 Why por'st thou, old Philosopher, Upon thy wormeat book, When the winds are making such a stir, And the leaves from the tree are shook? Think'st thou from that dead page's Lore, To strike Truth's warm lifespark? No! thou mayst pore, and pore, and pore, And make God's daylight dark. 2 Like the spider thou spinnest, and spinnest on, The web of thy flimsy brain, Some solid Truth breaks it, and thou anon Must patch it up again. Oh! look thou forth on the sunny Sky, On the Earth, whose flowers are springing, Or draw thy lore from the laughing Eye Of the child, unconsciously singing. 5 Wisdom is Bliss! to flourish and bloom, It asks both air and sun, Like plants, when shut up in the studentsroom, It loses its color anon! Yea! Wisdom grows in the Wear and Tear Of manycolored Life, And the fruits which the closet alone doth bear, In the open air ne'er thrive. 4 Oh! wisdom comes by ear and eye, From their vast and ample domain, From the changing face of humanity, In joy, and sorrow, and pain: And he who walks the same dull Round, And views the selfsame things, His heart, like his eye, hath a narrow bound, And his soul has lost its wings. GRAYHAIRS. 1. Can Time accord a fitter ornament To Age's brows, than its own silver hairs: Brought by his Messengers, the winged Years, A mark of his high Approbation meant? The seasonable Gray. by hours wellspent Strew'd with a gentle hand, which Wisdom wears As her best token: by no idle fears Disturbed, no tremblings thro' the calm heart sent, Where sublime Faith sits firm upon her throne: Counting in serene hope, as past they fly, The Sandgrains, lessening gradual, one by one: And looking on the grave with steadfast eye, 'Till worms and darkness vanish, and alone Remains the sense of Immortality! 2. Gray hairs are then like to a holy Wreath, By Angels wove for Virtue here below! But oh! how ill do they become the brow, When prematurely touched, and by the Breath Of Dissipation whitened! when beneath The temples, where no sanctity they throw, We trace the Feverpulse of passions low, Desires writhing in the grasp of Death, Yet prurient still: engrained by habitude, Tho' able scarce to warm the halffroze blood: Oh! then they are a bitter mockery, Placed there by time in his most scornful mood, A sign and token of his Triomph, by The Voice of Conscience sanctioned inwardly! NEWYEAR. Another year has flown!â what means this year, Or what this idle phrase with which I break My Fancy's Rest? how many days then make This year? what boots how many days there are? Let's take its measure in the heartâ aye there, Alas! 'tis oft a baseless dream, the wake Of a Bird thro' the Air: save by the Ache, And vain Regret it leaves, as if it ne'er Had been! 'tis then indeed gone by, and flown Recallessly: no Gooddeeds which, like flowers, Smell sweet, long after they are past and blown, And leave behind them ripened seeds for hours Of future bliss: but when the soul has known To use it well, past Time is still our own! THE SEASHELL. What is there in thee, thou deepvoicÃ«d shell, That when unto my ear I hold thee, I do seem to hear Th' eternal Ocean's hollowsounding swell, Tho' distancesoftened, as might be His low rockmusic, borne on the windswings To the sweet secrecy Of some embowered inland haunt: A spirit of wild murmurings, Like to a distancedying chaunt! What is there in thee, thou mysterious shell? For not unto the sensual ear, But rather to the soul, thy voice doth tell Its tale of wonder: and we hear The mighty Ocean rolling as of yore, When in our childish awe we stood upon the Shore. What Soul, what hidden Power, Hath taken up its haunt in thee, Crowding the Melodies Of multitudinous waves and echoloving caves, Within thy narrow boundary? I do remember in my boyish days, When wonder and delight Clothed, more than fancybright, The most familiar forms of weekday Being: Ere yet the Eye had lost the power of seeing With Joy's clear vision, and transfiguring rays Of Heavensplendor fell on this dim Earth: That Light which lingers round us at our birth, Dyings out of Glory, Scatterings from on high, The Beauty, and the Blessedness, and Love, Which, like a Garment, interwove above By Angels, clothes our Innocence: How I, not knowing whence Those shellborn sounds, that gushed on my young ear, Could come, did break in eagerness and fear, Their Mansionhouse, in hope to trace The Minstrel to his Dwellingplace! And when the shattered fragments round me fell, I did repent me: for I learnt too late, That in the Whole that Music's soul did dwell, Not of one part a function separate! And such too is the soul of man! He, who would its mistery scan, With his vain anatomy, May cut, and analyze, and try On his knifespoint the soul to fix, As Doubt upon the Crucifix Did Christ, yet allinvain, for Soul Is felt and known but as a Whole: And all that he can hope to find, This vain blindleader of the blind, Is but the shell, from whence the mind, Hath fled to the Immensity Of its own home, Eternity! But he who seeks the Oracle, Where alone 'tis wont to dwell, In the boundless living Whole, Unto him the human Soul, Be it in the breast of man, Or in Nature's sublime plan, (For by one same spirit they Are upheld and linked for aye:) Shall make clear and full reply, Authentic tidings from on high, Imparting warnings, holy fears, Visions as of olden seers, Thro' the changing mists of Time, Glimpses of a sunnier Clime: Snatches of far Melody, Dying in th' Immensity Of those realms beyond our thought, Whence their music's spell is brought! And as to the heedful ear, The shell gives notice full and clear, Of the hollowvoicÃ«d Ocean, And his timeunchangÃ«d motion, So the soul discourses well, Things which words in vain would tell, Of a faroff world of bliss, Whose voice at times is heard in this, Answering our souls, as Echo here Our body's voice, and not less clear: The chain of sympathy around All things invisibly is bound: And as Earth unto Earth tendeth, Spirit still with Spirit blendeth! THE GRAVE. Hast thou e'er wept above the grave of those Whom Love and Youth's affections bound to thee? Or in thy Afteryears, by Memory Recalled unto the spot, poured out thy woes There where the rank grass of neglect still grows As to reproach thine absence silently? Oh how it thrills the heart, that fain would be In its wild outburst as the clod that knows No sense of being: but as tears gush o'er The rank, parched weeds, Contrition's dew, the stream Of passion flows subdued to grief, no more Rends the poor heart intwain: oh then 't might seem As tho' some voice spoke in that calm, and bore Its mission to the soul, unheard before! And bade us turn unto the grave, and pray, Humbled and meek, as tho' the body there, With all Earth's withered hopes and follies, were Blent with the dust we love: the grave has aye A Spell of Mystery, that stirs the heart E'en to its inmost core, where hidden lie Thoughts that are not of time, that never die, Tho' they be smothered: it can heal the smart Of woes immedicable elsewhere: why Should we then turn to seek earth's cozening art? LIFE. Is it not written that man's portion here Must be of good and ill, a sojourning As in a Passageland, where everything That this life offers him must wither, sere As Autumnleaves? well were it if the tear Where shed alone, a holy offering, O'er nobler losses; but alas! we cling Unto the fleeting Moment, as it were A rock of Safety in Time's troublous sea. Wouldst thou be happy, then submit the Shows Of this vain life to the Supremacy Of Faith, who can transfigure e'en the throes Of the emprisoned Essence, 'till it be Sublimed and strengthened by its very woes! A SONG. The Greenwood with songs is ringing loud, The stream, 'neath the wing of a passing cloud, Is eddying fretful, like child at play, When chided, and then it hurries away In the bright sunshine, gleesome and glad, Like Joy, when calm Wisdom has touched the sad And darkling thoughts into Pleasure's hue, Turning our Fancies to channels new; Ye Greenwoodbirds, ye Greenwoodbirds, Oh tell me what sweet mystery Lurks in your notes, that thus, like words Of bygone days, they sound to me? Is it that in the heart of man, The feelings which with life began, Tho' gone, still leave their echos there, And when ye sing, they from their lair Start into life once more? Oh give me of your gentle lore But just so much that I may sing, And charm you on the stirless wing As you charm me: A touch of your own holy glee, Where selfdisturbance dwelleth not, Nor shadows of past faults to blot The stainless page of Memory! The Evening oalls ye to the nest, And bids her star watch o'er your rest, Twinkling so softly thro' The dewleaves, where your gleesome eyes Are closed, and hushed the harmonies, That from your bosoms flow. And when the sun's cloudgilding ray Falls on ye, up ye start, and away, To the Greenwood again, Thus is your life, from day to day, A joy and a beauty, a charm for aye, With not a shadow of pain! What silent Wisdom do ye teach To us, who, in our Pride, still preach Of God's high Word and Grace; We mouthe the blessed Truth, yet ne'er The seed within our hearts can bear Its fruit, or leave a trace. For oh! a fretful, stiffnecked Will, Is quicker than the thorns to kill, And choke the wholesome seed, But ye are wise, ye learn, not teach, And practice, while we idly preach, Of rules ye have no need! Ye find a bed 'neath every leaf, Your joy is long, your toil is brief, Ye live much in short time! Ye bring me sweet, sweet memories, Of times when I was e'en As ye are, with your gladsome eyes, Tho' no more what I've been! Farewell, farewell, ye happy things, Oh that I had a pair of wings With ye to fly in bliss, From this vain scene of cares and fears, Where Joy faintsmiles thro' Sorrow's tears, And all but seems, not is! ALL'S RIGHT. Oh God, with thee whatever is, is right, Still will I hold my faith in weal or woe, And when it is not given me to know Thy boundlessness, when this unaided sight May not pierce thro' the mists that lie, like night, Betwixt my glance and Truth, I will not grow Fainthearted or impatient, but will bow In humble confidence and hope, and light Shall not be then refused me, for thou art Allwise, alljust; when least thou seemest nigh, Thou'rt in us and around us: let the smart Of suffering touch my spirit then with high, Calm revelations, still a contrite heart I'll offer thee, all else is mockery. EVENING. The last, faint, rosy Tinge is shot up by The Sun into the Clouds, on Ocean's Breast, Still as a sleeping Flower, sunk to Rest! How soft and balmy is the Air! the Sky, Startwinkling, spreads like a light veil on high, Betwixt our glance and heaven: from the West The Day's last blush has faded: pure and blest As on the primal Eve all Earth doth lie, Bound with the eternal chain of Love, which far And near extends, linking the loneliest star, That sparkles in its Solitude of light 'Mid Heaven's blue depths, with the least flowers that are Strewn o'er the untrod Wild: oh glorious sight! Better than man's vain lore when read aright! This holy Calm can check the idle War Of Passions, and, with its so gentle Might, Bend, as these Flowers are bent, our Hearts to Prayer! THE WIFE. 1 The Lovesmile's on thy Lip, my dear, And in thy darkblue Eye, Yet dimming not, a soft, bright Tear, Is melting dewily. 2 Art thou the same, unaltered now, As on the Bridalday, With downcast Eye, and blushing Brow, Thou trod'st the Altarway? 3 Has Time who changes all Things round, Wrought not some Change in thee, Have Marriagevows been but a Sound, And Hope, a Mockery? 4 Thou art the same, my Heart doth say, What tho' brief Flowers die, Life's Fruit matures 'neath true Love's Ray, And ripens for the Sky. 5 Thou sworÃ«st, with an Altaroath, To love and honor me, And in thy Life thou hast done both In Truth and Honesty. 6 As Graftboughs, on a nobler Stock, Do lose Illqualities, So from thy Heart mine also took High Capabilities. 7 In loving thee, I loved the Truth And Virtue clothed to Sight, And loving thus, Man feels his Worth Increase, 'tis Love's Birthright! 8 Thy Brow is still as fair to me, As in thy Maydayprime, Truelove has never Eyes to see The Changes wrought by Time. 9 Thou art Reality to Hope, The Wakingday to Youth's wild Dreams, And Fancy, in his Rainbowscope, Grasped scarcely more than Fact now seems! 10 More! no, not half so much as one Beat of thy human Breast, This gives the Dream a Charm unkno wn, Itself Worth all the Rest! 11 Our Hearts have learnt to beat as one, And when thou think'st on me, It is but as an echoing Tone Of what I think of thee, 12 And as we near our Journeysend, We 'll fling all Fears away, Death shall light Hymen's Torch, and lend It Strength to burn for aye! EARLY MORNING. Yon' lazy Clouds are touched, and as with a Soft, sleepy Light they kindle, rent into Transparent Fragments: stirless lies the Dew- Drop on each Leaf, as if the waking Day Held in his Breath, still loth to scare away Those Clouds, which, like to Dreams fantastic, strew The eastern Sky: in Masses Objects thro' The glittering Mists loom out: there, Mountains grey, Whose Peaks gleam clear above: here, Woods in one Broad Shade, Hue blent with Hue, and Tree with Tree. Oh Fancy stay those Clouds, and bid yon' Sun Shine ever on them thus, let nothing be Resolved into its Elements, that on The Vision I may gaze, and when I see It still unaltered, think that over me No Change has passed, that Time's a Dream alone! HAPPINESS. The happiest Man, my Friend, in this dark World, Who bears the Evil best, and thus inclines The Gods to smile on him: when we are free From Selfdisturbance and Selftreachery, At one within ourselves, oh then we fight Righthanded and righthearted: 'tis a Cause In which we are ennobled, and the Strife Itself is Gain: for Man has but one Foe, And that the worst, himself! and tho' no Wreath Time bind upon our Brows, for Conquests vain, Where nought is won, and most is put at Stake, Our Peace of Mind, yet are we rich at Heart: For Faith with Selfcontent her Sabbath there Has made: and all our calm Affections bend Thither, as Fruits to the riperaying Sun, Drawing their Health and Durableness thence: Nor is our Virtue less a Gain, tho' here Below, it reap no vain Reward of Wealth, No fickle Smiles of Fortune: these are but A Recompense to such as value them, (And poor is he whom they can recompense:) They worship but the empty Shows of Things, Not the eternal Essence, which, in them Belied, is an avenging Presence, not The godlike Truth, that moulds them to the Shape And Likeness of Immortals! other Meed And fitter Recompense the Deity To such accords: the Consciousness Worth, That on the weekday Strife of this brief Scene Can shed a Sabbathpeace, a Confidence, And Selfrespect, which neither Hope delayed, Nor venomlippÃ«d Hate, nor Calumny, Backsliding Friends, nor anyother Shape Of Ill can undermine or shake! LIFE Man's life is as a torrent that flows on Its barren bed all chafed and frettingly, Fuming and foaming o'er the stones that lie In its unquiet track: his Course is run 'Mid fretting hopes and fears, that one by one Wear the heartspeace away, and dim the eye, As streams mine out their banks: some gilded Lie, Wealth, Fame, Ambition, Power, which when won Yields no Fruition, save a feverish Joy, That bursts in Foam, and on the barren shore Of Disappointment breaks, still hovers o'er His cradle to his grave: a greyhaired boy, He stands upon the brink, nor dreams before The Edgeearth crumbles in, that life's no more! NATURE. Pluck the stillgnawing thought from out thy heart, Forget thyself a while, and turn thine eye Unto the varied forms, that round thee lie, Of pure and sinless happiness; each part Whispers a holy calm, which doth impart A sense of some deep Presence ever nigh, Felt, like the wind, tho' viewless: nor would I Exchange the eloquent silence, the dumb art With which kind Nature woos me to her breast, For all the finespun rules Philosophy Weaves in her flimsy web: her everblest, Eternal smile, reproving silently, Contrasts our petty momentgriefs: her rest Is a calm centralpeace diffusÃ«d outwardly! VENICE. Venice, the Past's dark shadow on thy brow Of Sadness, veillike, rests! so the shroud lies Above a recent corpse: yet still the ties Of gratitude, the thoughts of what we owe To thee and thine, forbid that thou should'st know The fate of meaner things: the heart denies Thy name to cold Forgetfulness, and tries To make the Past a Future, and to throw Above thy Sunset the rich hues which speak Of a more brilliant Dawn! thy name evokes Shadows of might and glory, and unlocks A World: but now thy light is dim and weak, And the shipcradling billow proudly rocks No fleets of thine: thus Fate, where Envy fails, will shake! RHINEFALLS BY SUN-AND-MOONLIGHT. 1. How gloriously it comes dashing on, As absolute in its lone Majesty As is the deepvoiced Thunder, flashing by, Dazzling the Eye and Brain! the parting Sun Has wove the Spray in Rainbowhues that run Like a Triumphalarch, where Phantasy On winged Step may tread, and fearless eye The seething Gulf below! and now 'tis gone, And now in Beauty it appears again, Like Bliss wrung out from mortal Sense of Pain! 2. See how the flashing Waters foam along, Bursting the sullen Calm, in which but late They seemed to slumber, with a Bound, like Hate Springing upon his Victim, and among The jaggÃ«d Rocks below, as with a Song Of Triomph, hurry onwards and abate Their Fury, in the Distance, to a State Of calmÃ«d Agitationâ what a Throng Of Thoughts such Scenes awake within the Breast That seeks to lay a weary Heart at Rest 'Mid Nature's Tumult: for this deafening Roar Of maddened Waters, can, methinks, arrest All other Thoughts, drawn from the inmost Core Into their Stream, like Bubbles on its Breast! 3. The Moon is up, and e'en the Cataract's Pain And Torture seem beneath the Smile she flings To grow more calm and hushed! thus Love's Glance brings Balm to the bruisÃ«d Heart, tho' still in vain All Grief she would obliterate: now sings The merry Nightingale, from Tree to Tree, Flooding the Earth and Air with Harmony, Essence of Bliss, no Reflex of past Years, A Moment's feverish Joy, but holy Glee, Exuberant Innocence of Heart, that fears No Diminution, nor can saddened be! 4. How holily the soft Moon's silver Light Falls on the boiling Waves, that foam below, As if with calm Composure on her Brow She chid their Fret and Fever: oh how bright, Unutterably dazzling to the Sight, The paley Foam that o'er the Edge doth flow Of the halfmoonshaped Rocks, until it grow Into a white Flamewreath, and from its Height Melts off in Silverflakes, like Snow! the Sky, Studded with clustering Stars, within the Stream Floats undulating; might not Fancy deem That the bright Heavens glided swiftly by, Rent into glittering Fragments, Beam on Beam, And Star on Star, 'till lost 'mid Spray unto the Eye? 5. O God, how glorious are thy Works, how fair In evervarying Beauty! I could gaze Upon this Scene for ever, in a Maze Of sweetentangled Thoughts, which seem to share The Colors, Sights, and Sounds, that on the Air And Waters float; amid a silver Haze, As thro' a gauzelike Veil, the Forms we trace Of Rocks and Trees, and the soft Breezes bear The Music of their dewy Leaves, the low And gentle Breathing of the Birds at Nest, And the glad Things that on the Sward below Take their due Share of undisturbed Rest, With which kind Nature seals up every Woe, As each lies hushed on its great Mother's Breast! THE GRAVE. Behold yon Grave, that in the golden Light Of the slowsinking Sun is steep'd so fair! The Flowers, growing on it, by the Air Are scarcely stirred, and to the musing Sight, By Nature's self thus taught to read aright The Forms of Being, it seems as it were Selected by the Elements, that there Some holy Wonder of their gentle Might May fitliest be display'd! it is indeed A Type of perfect Rest: and as it lies So calm and still, e'en superstitious Dread Smiles at itself, and all the Calumnies Which sadden o'er the Grave; then be thou wise, And by the Light of Nature learn to read, (For thus alone thou canst) her Mysteries! She hereself explains all Things: let her lead Thee then into the Templeâ if thine Eyes, And Ears, and Heart, be open, thou canst need Nought else: to such the Oracle replies! THE WORLD. Like to an Alabastervase, made by The Light within transparent, even so Is this vast World, whence ceaselessly doth flow The Light of God on Faith's calm, ample Eye! Like a clear Diamond, everlastingly Sparkling and flashing with an inward Glow, And which, reflected by the Soul, will throw Into it Light direct from the Mosthigh! God looks on us from everything, if we Have but the Power him in all to see: And to that End naught else is requisite, Save that as one with him we feel and be; Thus having in ourselves His divine Light, We cannot fail to read His Works aright! LOVE. The Heart has need of Love, 'tis the pure Air, The vital Air, on which the Spirit lives And breathes: and all the Honey that it hives, Like that of the Sardinian Bee, must bear Some taint of earthly bitterness, if there Love his diviner Sweets mix not! Heart strives To blend with Heart, and baffled, but survives To a dull sense of being, thus to wear And turn upon itself in agony! Life stagnates, like a dammed up stream, instead Of flowing sweetly on, and passes by Waste, unproductive, like a vile, rank weed. Man may not live unto himself alone And not call down a curse: for God has said, Â«Increase and multiplyÂ»: the Heart must wed Another Heart, for happiness is won, E'en as the body's offspring, not from one, But union of two: and it doth need Community and intercourse to feed Its holy flame, which else dies out anon! FREEDOM: ON THE FIRST FRENCH REVOLUTION. Ye fools! that rend the calm and silent air With insane noise, and shouts of Liberty; The thrall today tomorrow cannot be A freeman, still the shackles must he bear Within his soul, tho' from his limbs they are By the brute hand of Force struck off! think ye That in one brief and noisy hour the tree Of Freedom flourishes? oh never were Her golden fruits plucked by the sudden hand Of Violence, they ripen gradually! And never were her divine features scanned 'Mid Passion's Chaos; with calm Majesty She snaps the sword and treads out the firebrand, For of brute means she scorns the ministry! TO F. L. Shall the rude enmity of Time consign Such features to forgetful apathy? Dim the soft lustre of that starry Eye, Wherein so much of Heaven's light doth shine, Or mix those ringlets with the dust, that twine Their rich profusion unrestrainedly, O'er thy fair brow? what tho' each charm should die, Each beauty wither, and to Earth resign The tints, the hues, the forms, which every bright And loveliest thing had lent thee; still the Might, The starry Lustre of thy cloudless Eyes, Time shall not dim: these with the source of light And truth shall mingle, and thy spirit rise, Like dewdrop from the flower, exhaled to purer Skies! DANTE. Hail, Eaglebard, that on thy fearless wings Bear'st Heaven's Judgmentfire, and from on high Swoop'st down the dread abyss, where howling lie The damned, whose throes thy aweful Poem sings, Awards, and measures out! before thee kings And nations pass, like stern Reality, Thyself the dread Minos whose firmset Eye Strikes terror thro' the guilty Throng; Hell rings With sullen shrieks of Woe, and grim Despair, The Maniac, thence pale, trembling Hope doth scare! Dante! what mighty Task was thine, to be The Deity on Earth, in his stead there To punish and reward, to bind and free! Yet if allmighty Genius might share Allmighty Power, not ill such task befitted thee! TO AN OLD HOMESONG. 1 Oh sweet, sweet Music of the Past, Sweet Voice of early Days, How much of Joy and Pain thou hast, How much dwells in thy Lays! 2 Let others lend the outward Ear To newmade Fancysongs, But let me still thy Music hear, Which to the Heart belongs. 3 Time robs thee not, but to thee lends Tones of old Melody, And mellowing, with thy Music blends Thoughts, Hopes, that cannot die. 4 He makes thee as a holy Thing, And when we hear thy Lays, Our Hearts grow as a Child's again, Full of those early Days! 5 Unconsciously at Eventide Thy Words steal to the Tongue, For in the deep Heart doth abide The Spirit of thy Song! 6 Voiceing itself by Words alone To which Time gives a Power Of ampler Utterance, unknown To those framed for the Hour! 7 For they are Words which human Fears And Hopes have holy made, Of which each as its Portion bears A Spell that cannot fade. 8 Thee by the mossy Graves we sing, Where Voices, silent long, Awake from their deep Slumbering, And mingle with thy Song! 9 But fare thee well, thou sweet, sweet Strain, Thou Voice of early Years, Thou fill'st my timedim Eyes again With Childhood's blessed Tears! 10 The bygone Heart beats in my Breast: And what are we but as The Heart within us, grieved or blest? Thus I am what I was! SLEEP. 1. Oh Sleep, oh Blessedness! come, sprinkle thou My feverparchÃ«d lips with freshest dew Of thy Lethean Wreath; pluck me a Bough Of the songfabled Fruitage, which erst grew In that imagined Isle, by Atlas-wave Kept sacred: so my pale cheek shall once more Be pleasureflushed: and on my eyelids squeeze Thy drops of sweet Forgetfulness; I crave No vulgar boon, nought save That thou wouldst give me back the days of yore, When sense was bliss, and Earth's least sight could please! 2. I am a child again! the pleasant dew Lies on the grass and flowers, yet untrod, Those drops, which, once trod on, naught can renew: And Echo, like the Voice of some high God, Comes on my ear; it is enough for me, To feel these things, I would not seek to know The why or wherefore; for what can I learn From proud Philosophy, Who lifts the veil from Nature's holy Brow, And shows a Skeleton by brute Springs made to turn? 3. Pleasure grows on the Earth, like its Wildflowers, Who will, may gather them, and twine a wreath For unoffending brows; the passing hours Are winged with Joy, but he who sees beneath Each bloom a sleeping snake, he is the thrall Of melancholy Thought, and he will find The Ill he fears: his Fear a worse Ill is! Joy dwells in great and small, 'Tis in ourselves, a Light from out the mind, And bubblelike, the World gives back but this! 4. Oh Sleep! thou leavest me: delicious dream! Or why should I not say reality? Have I not been in blessedness? a stream Poured back to its pure Springhead in the sky! Aye! let the proud Philosopher exclaim, Â«Tis but a dream!Â» aye! let him kill the bee, To thus dissect its honeybag! yet if A Dream can give back Youth, set free From cares that dull the Pulse of waking Life, Reality's by far the idler Name! MOUNTAINTORRENT. This cloudborn Stream, cradled'mid Mists and Snows, Whose Lullaby, the Wind, a rude Nurse, sings, 'Till, like a foaming Steed, itself it flings From Rock to Rock, with Impetus that knows No salutary Check, here onward flows In calmer Beauty, and the Flower springs Round its moist Marge, whose soft Meanderings, Leading thro' Greenwoodnooks and under Brows Of overhanging Crags, with Ivy grown, Might tempt the Naiad to her Noontidesleep! Its Course resembles and instructs Man's own: In its vain Tumult it was loud, not deep, And on its Brink, no Flower as yet had blown, But here its calmer Path with all sweet Things is strown! AGAINST ABSURD AND UNJUST PREJUDICES. 1. Why Bastard? wherefore should ye then disclaim Relationship with him? in what Sense is He Bastard, pray? is God not as much his Father as yours? and if God by that Name Proclaims him his own Child, shall ye feel Shame To call him Brother? but if ye do this, Ye are the Bastards, and, as such, must miss Your Portion of that Love, which, in the same Degree, all, all His Children share in, yea! The very meanest! for how can ye be His Children without Love? for is not he Love itself? were ye then His Children, pray, Must ye not in this be like Him? must ye Not by Love your divine Descent display? 2. God casts off none, not e'en the Sinner! no! But opens wide his Arms, will he but say, Â«Our Father which art in Heaven,Â» thus to show His Penitence! and wilt thou thrust away, Thou scornful Heart and hardened! that which may Lie even in God's Bosom? then take Heed Lest he too thrust thee from Him in thy Need! For thou hast cast Him off, in casting Love Aside, for he is Love! and without this, None, none can enter Heav'n! for Heav'n is But Love, be it on Earth, or up above! And both alike, thro' Unlove, thou must miss! CHARITY. Hast thou e'er loved, or for thy human Brow Wove that best Wreath, of kindly Charities, Which, with perpetual Spring, 'neath rudest Skies And polar Snows, will bloom, as bright as tho' 'Twere cheered by southern Sun's ne'erwintering Glow? Hast thou e'er plucked the Thorn that gnawing lies In Sorrow's Heart, or with soft Sympathies Bound round Life's blighted Tree, and bade to grow Again the crushed and trailing Tendrils, which The Storm had beat to Earth, or heedlesly Some rude Step bruised, not sought to raise again? If thou hast loved such deeds, then art thou rich Beyond all Wealth, and happy, for if by These Means it be not won, thy Search is vain! THE GREAT MAN. The great Man, tho' above his Fellows he May tower like a God, stands meek before His Maker as an Infant! yea! the more He in his Wisdom near to God may be, The vast Space but the clearer will he see Which parts them still; he cannot pluck a Flower, A Dayseye from the Grass, and not adore Therein the Masterhand that framed it! the Worst Ills of Life embitter not his Mind, Nor make the godlike Eye within him blind! He cannot doubt a Moment, for that would Be the most bitter Ill of all which could Befall him, since he'd cease to be thereby The godlike which he is! and how, how should He doubt that, for that would be to belie Himself, a willful Putting-out the Eye Of Reason: but as he sees by it, this Can never be! and Reason is not his, But God's Eye likewise! and therefore he, who Sees with it, must see godlike, must see true: And, seeing so, will estimate aright That chiefest Good, and hold all others light Compared with it, the Godlike, which he is And feels, Man's highest Duty, Recompense, and Bliss! FALSE GLORY. 1. Fame, Power, Gain, Conquest, every specious Name With which Men gild those Objects here below Of such loud Prayers and Hopes, as they do grow From rank and unpruned Wishes, naught save Shame And Disappointment fruit: if Folly sow, Destruction's Sickle will the Harvest mow! Poised on his giant Wing of Ages, o'er Life's changeful Scene Time flies, at every Sweep The Dust of dull Oblivion piling deep On Crowns and Sceptres, and the Pomp of Yore, Shattered beneath his kingdomcrushing Step! 2. Empires from out the Dust of Empires spring, Unborn, undying Substance, still the same, Yet everchanging, purg'd by penal Flame, And scourging Miseries, due to Crimes that bring A Curse of Vengeance on their bloodstained Wing, And call from Earth to Heaven, on the Name Of watchful Justice: and as if there came A Voice from out their Depths, the Heavens ring In Answer, tho' to Man's untunÃ«d Ear, 'Tis allunheard, or seems but lost in Air: Whereat he laugheth to himself, in Scorn Hardening his Heartâ but Heaven, quick to hear, Shall register, and of Time's Fullness born, Vengeance shall smite him, and his Pride be shorn! 3. For God, allwise, alljust, whose boundless Sight Can grasp the vast and dread Immensity Of Worlds unborn, to whom all Space is nigh, All Times are Â«Now,Â» deigns not to stoop his Might To crush Sin's mightiest ones, but to the Blight Of their own evil Counsels leaves them, by Their own Snares caught at last, a Mockery And Byeword to all Time! when at the Height And selfo'erbalanced Summit of his Power, (For with allmeasuring Compass evernigh, Wisdom marks out to future Worlds their Hour And Space unto a Hair, as easily As she congeals the Snowflake, or on high Gathers the Clouds, or paints Earth's tiniest Flower,) 4. When at the topmost Aim, and fullest Swing Of his permitted Licence, Crime shall bite The Dust he spurns, hurled from his dazzling Height By the same Whirlwind whose so sudden Wing Had borne him thither from Men's wondering Sight! When Time is ripe, the Elements of Light Bestir their Agencies, and gathering, Like Summerthunderclouds surcharged with Fire, The good and evil Principles in dire, But brief, Collision hurtle, 'till once more The moral Atmosphere be as before. 5. For Light and Truth are in their Nature free From Contact and Contamination: tho' The Powers of Hell were leagued to lay them low, They mount direct, in stainless Purity, As purer Flames from gross, and join the Sky; While Evil, like the Thundercloud below On downward and earthladen Wing, can show Wrath but to kindred Matter, that may be Corrupted like itself, and wreaks its Ire On the Earth's prone and sinpolluted Breast, Strewn with its base, material Bolts, the Fire Stolen from grosser Elements, opprest By its own Earthliness, and in the Mire, From which't was drawn, soon spent: thus Earth has Rest! The Spirit of eternal Wisdom o'er The troublous Waves of Time pursues his Flight, Gathering the Thought of Ages, while the Light Of Truth falls on his bright Wings more and more! Empires have crumbled, like sere Leaves, and save The pregnant Moral speaking from their Grave, What Truths have thence enriched Man's slowhiv'd Lore? 6. Time's mighty Panorama still moves on, A Dream of Ages: Empries, Cities, Kings, Ambition's Triomphs, Pride's vain Boasts, are Things Which pass away, like Clouds that with the Sun, In Thunderfragments rent, when Day is done, Sink in the Womb of Night, which Morn back brings, Moulded to other Semblance: thus Time rings His mighty Changes, 'till his Race be run! Phantom succeedeth Phantom, Shadow Shade, Coming we know not whence, and pass we know Not where or how, like Sounds the Wind has made, Dying in boundless Space: the Strife, the Woe, The Crimes and Pomps of Ages fleet, and lo! Time's goneâ Eternity is in his Stead! KIRKSTEAD-ABBEY. Art thou lonetowering wall, whose stormbeat brow The darkplumed ravens make their airy Nest, The soleremaining remnant to attest The Might and Majesty which here lie low? Wild Flowers and the Ivy's leaves o'er grow Thy oncecloudcleaving Towers: all is rest Around, as tho' deep into Nature's breast The Spirit of Religion, which once threw Its charm o'er thee, had sunk, thus blent again With her calm heart! to us, who live alone In the Soul's Essence, Time destroys in Vain: We can create anew, recall the tone, Whose echos sleep 'mid these old stones, the strain Of choral hymns, and bid past scenes be shown! ON A WATERFALL, SEEN FROM A GLENSTREAM, BORN OF THE SAME. Seest thou yon' far off waterfall, which flows, Yet seems airfixt immoveably? the ear Its loud, rockshattering foamstep cannot hear, By Distance spellbound: even so Youth shows To Wisdom's sobered eye, that grows, and grows, To that calm Mood from which nor Hope nor Fear Of passing Nothings claim one tributary Tear! Youth's noisy moments, Fancy's selfsought woes, The World's vain temptings, loudvoiced promises, Seen thro' the Vista of departed days, Are like yon' waterfall; while at a wise And sober distance, thro' the soothing ways Of selfcontent, Life's now calm stream supplies With quiet Strength all that around it lies, Like this sweet brook, tho' born of yon' wild Cataract's sprays! TO WASHINGTON Ambition's gilded baits, the fleeting reek Of popular favor, thou didst alldespise, And Power among her greedy Votaries Numbered not thee, her heartless ones, who seek Their own weal not the common, whom the weak And fickle herd bows down before as to Its benefactors, 'till the chain be so By Custom rivetted no force can break, Unless by such as thee the way be shown: The nations, with one voice of praise, hail'd thee Their true deliverer, and Liberty Knelt in thy path to bless thee! we do own Thy Name an Inspiration, that alone Might be a Talisman of Victory! HEARTKNOWLEDGE. 1 O God! what tho' from thine allseeing eye The consciencehaunted Sinner shrinks in fear, Yet to the injured man, whose breast is clear, 'Tis sweet to think that thou art evernigh, His one sure friend: that thou unerringly Canst read the heart, and trace the sudden tear To its true source, when Malice will not hear, And Calumny cuts off from sympathy: Our actions may be misinterpreted, False motives urged, good blackened into ill, And proud Philosophy at best can read The changeful features with a skindeep skill; Can a few lines, traced by years longsince fled, Make known the inmost Movings of the Will? 2 Dull Fools! the Heart has deeper mysteries Than may be pierced by philosophic ken, It is not made to beat, as Pedantspen Propounds fine rules and sounding theories: Nor can we regulate it as we please, Like the timesplitting watch, still Joy and Pain Disturb and make our calculations vain: And Malice, busy Fiend, tho' she have eyes Far sharperken'd than dull Philosophy, Yet sees all thro' the medium of Hate; 'Tis God alone who knows the when and why, How Hope and Fear the heart's poor fibres try, The sufferings which Follies must create, Which, while they blame, the Good commiserate. HISTORY. If thou'rt welloracled in History, If thou look'st 'neath the surface, to the Soul That animates, upholds, and moves the Whole, If thou hast traced the vast machinery Of moral causes to its source on high, Then wilt thou ask no palpable miracle To show thee that which thou canst prove as well By weekdaylife's familiar agency; All seems Confusion to the Sceptic's sight, For still he wants the inwardguiding light: He dwells not in the Harmony of things, And therefore cannot read their forms aright: 'Tis Faith alone who gives to Reason wings To view the mighty Maze from a due height! THE FLEETINGNESS OF EARTHLY THINGS. 1. Are these the grand results, which Centuries Of toil and crime, which conquerors and kings Have built up to their glory? fleeting things That fade almost beneath their maker's Eyes, For soul and worth are wanting! who replies? From the Past's Ruins a stern Voice. Â«Time brings All Deeds, Names, Works, to Proof, with errless wings Winnows the true from false, and onward flies, Bearing the good towards Eternity, While, like to withered leaves, the evil die! 2. And what is this dull Present, which e'en now, E'en as I think and speak, has ceased to be? Which is, and is not, like a cunning Lie Made but to cheat and cozen fools! e'en so, By this the grave and cradle touch, as tho' The Interval were but a Mockery, A Moment's feverish Dream, where the Mindseye Dwells on a Phantomtrain, which straight below Th' horizon of another life in fears And mystery is lost, where keenest sight Discerns no track: the torch that Reason bears But tells us that we stray, yet sets not right; We live not when we should, the Past with Tears We mourn, the Present for the Future slight, Whose dim veil Hope lifts with a Throb of fear: For when we turn unto the Past and raise Time's Pall, a Skeleton alone is there, And from the hollow Jaws a Voice that says To Fancy, such shall be the Future, fair In Prospect, but in Retrospect, like me: 'tis where? 3. Like to a giddy Child, that hears no more The warning voice, but hurries headlong on, Lured by some fly that sparkles in the sun Above the dangerous brink, e'en so before The fullgrown Child Hope dances with her store Of bright Illusions, 'till Life's Game be done, Shaped to his thoughts and wishes: one by one The Present's slighted moments steal, and o'er The treacherous brink of dread Eternity His heedless foot is stretched, and on the air His arms are flung, to clasp the gilded Lie Which Hope still offers to his cheated eye! It fades, he sees th' Abyss, in wild despair To the lost Past he looks, then sinks for ever there! And sounds as of the damned ring in his ear, While Memory, like the lightning thro' the night, Scattering the gloom, evokes unto his sight Life's spectretrain, the deeds of doubt and fear, The moments lost, the cradle and the bier! ENDVERSES. 1. Thanks, thanks, great God, Part of my Task is done, The Labourer in thy Vineyard now may rest A while, and if the Thought that I my Best Have essayed can reward, then want I none! The Harp is now laid by, to gather Tone And Strength, yet ready at the least Behest Of divine Love, to plead still for opprest And suffering Humanityâ this one Great Thought still prompts me, still doth it impart High Revelations: 'tis God's Voice, and oft It seems to come direct from upaloft, Now pealing with the Thunder, 'till I start Like Prophet from his Visions, and now soft As a Babe's Lisp, pressed to his Mother's Heart! Yet mightier far in his least Cry than in The rolling Thunder's heavencleaving Din! 2. And as my Lyre first awoke for thee, Sublimest Spirit of Humanity! With that best Inspiration which must come Fresh from the Heart, and finds in all a Home, So let thy Spirit prompt the Closingstrain, Be thou but here, all other Muse is vain. The fabled Hoof of Pegasus could make The Poetsfountain from the hard Rock break, But deeper, from Man's universal Heart, The living Poesy of Life must start! 3. And now, like Lark, softdropping from the Sky, My Song must fold its Wings, and silent lie, As Flower closing with the Eveningstar; But tho' it soar, the Godlike is not far From its low Nest in Earth's familiar Lap: No not one Tittle further than the Sap Is from the Blossom, or than God is from The Goodman's Heart! there is no need to roam, For God is with us here, as up above, Yea! in us, if we do but live by Love! 4. Then feel it so, and the least Flower, that lies Before thee, will in its own silent Way So touch thee, that the Tears shall fill thine Eyes, And thou wilt kneel down by its Side to pray! Yea! 'till the Bird's least Note, or Babe's least Cry Will wake up Nature's boundless Harmony, Now gliding o'er the Eath, now pealing far Thro' Heaven's blue Depths, from hymning Star to Star! It is the Heart first opens all the Ear! Then do but feel, and thou 'lt not fail to hear! 5. Now lay my Verse aside, and turn again To Weekdaylife, and if not allinvain I've struck the Chords, then often wilt thou catch, Amid its harshest Sounds, some divine Snatch Of Melody, some Chancenote of my Strain Will, ever and anon, break on thine Ear, Recalling this poor Verse, made haply dear For Nature's sake, else littleworth indeed, Lasting thro' her, for that grows never sere Which with her Forms is linked! yes, thou shalt hear Heartreaching Music, if thou wilt give Heed, Oft, like the Cricket's Chirrup, where thou ne'er Wouldst have expected it; first faint and dim, But straight upswelling to a mighty Hymn! Strike but one Note, and then thine Ear shall by The whole deep Music of Humanity Be ravished, and if I have done but this, Enough is done, the Rest thou canst not miss! Then shalt thou hear far other Lyre than mine, A mightier Lyre, and touched by Hand divine, Of which the Hearts of all Men are the Strings, Filling the wide World with its Murmurings! This shalt thou hear, nay, with thy mortal Hand Shalt play thereon, and have at thy Command The Stops of all its wondrous Harmonies! But first thy own Heart must be tunedâand to That End, go turn to bright Realities What here are idle Words: in Actions true Embody these poor Thoughts, then wilt thou be The Poet, and not I: the Wreath to Thee Is due, and from my most unworthy Head I pluck it, to adorn thy Brows instead! Yes, he, he is the Poet, who can make That Life which was but Poetry, who views The World, like God, Thro' Love clothed in such Hues As Landscape ne'er from Fancy's Touch could take! The Sense of human Life, in its most low, Unelevated State, to him brings no Rude Disenchantment of some cherished Dream; The more awake he is, the more 'twill seem Sublime! he would not dream, not if he could, For to be quite awake that is the good Man's Priviledge alone!â awake unto And with God, labouring His Will to do; This is to be awake in godlike Wise, And who would mix vain Dreams, or close his Eyes But for a Moment? since where can he be So well as in God's Presence, or what see More lovely than the waking Eye looks on? For God is in all Things, 'tis him alone They glorify, and Him recall to Mind! And who would lose the Consciousness of Him, Tho' but for one least Moment? then grows dim The Eye, and dull the Heart, and we are blind! Awake thou then with the whole Heart and Eye, Feel and see nought but God eternally, This is the godlike Way of seeing, this Likens thee unto God, and makes thine Eye as His! LAMENT FOR LOVE, FAITH, AND POESI. Written in 1832. 1 In all this wide World, not a Thing the Eye Dwells on, but taketh Sweetness from the Heart And giveth, 'till 'tis brimmed with Ecstasy, Like a rich Beehive, stored from every Part Of the Twinrealms of Nature and of Art, Wherein, as in a twofold Mirror, we Behold all Beauty multiplied, and start Back at the Outline, which we therein see, Of the Eternal's Form reflected visibly. 2 Thus to the Grecian Poet's raptured Sight, Each Part of that romantic Landscape, where His Breath he drew, grew redolent and bright, And fairylifed, and thence his Thoughts so clear, And Fancies, like his blue Skies clouded near, (In sculptured Verse, and Marbles calm and chaste, Hived up), were drawn. Passions that fret or sear, Nor false Refinement, had as yet effaced The Freshness of the Heart, nor with vain Forms replaced 3 And secondhand Impressions, the first deep, Fresh Movements of the Soul: the natural Eye Interprets Nature best, not taught to sleep O'er Pedant's Page, stuffed Specimens, and dry, Dull Terms of Art, that Chaff threshed so oft by The Flail of sweating Logic, while the Grain Is ripening free and strong'neath Rain and Sky, And Nature's vigorous Sons, with Might and Main, Are reaping the good Field, which none e'ersow in vain. 4 The Heart interprets Nature, not the Head: Its Yearnings and Affections are the Key To many Secrets; thus the Poet, fed On Nature's freshest Milk, could clearest see The Link 'twixt Things which ever kindred be; The Spirit must in spiritual Forms Embody its own Essence: to be free Still striving, it blends with, and all Things, warms, Like Element thro' all it passes, and informs 5 With its own Consciousness: in this like Him, The mighty Spirit who informs the Whole. Unconsciously, and only in a dim Instinctive Way at first, the yearning Soul Takes after him who made it, as the Mole Works upward towards the Light: but Man is no Vain Hieroglyphick, from which Time has stole All Meaning, an obscure Inscription, to Which no Solution lies, of some old Tongue laid low! 6 Like that on an Etruscan Urn, e'en by Tradition's self forgot, to mock the Lore Of proud Philosophy, with filmy Eye! He is a Part, fresh, living as before, Of Nature's living Language: nay, is more: Man is the Alphabet by which to know The Rest thereof, and he in vain will pore, Who learns not this, on Nature's Volume; no True meaning will it have, nor as a Mirror show 7 The Invisible Things of Godâthis felt the Greek, The Poet, he whose viewless Wings by more Than mortal Airs were borne above the Reek Of Mammon's Dwellings. He on Rock and Flower, O'er bubblebeaded Fount, and fabulous Moor, On Bud and Bell, bright Dewdrops shed around Of his fresh Fancy, 'neath whose spellful Power A thousand sweet Shapes rose, whose Voices sound In the soft Lapse of Streams, or from the Grove profound. 8 Then first the gentle Dryad saw the Day, The leafhid Guardian of Wood and Bower, Chaunting 'mid choral Shade and Bough her Lay, But if upon her still and chosen Hour Unholy Footing broke, or aught that bore Less Sanction than a Poet's Step, sworn to Her Rites, then Echo conned her Song no more. Then with her Oak the Hamadryad grew, And died: coborn, cofading, as true Love should do. 9 Then first the Nymphs above the moonlit Fount Passed with their printless Feet, and sweetened o'er The gurgling Waters: or from Dale and Mount Responsive Voices rose with gentle Power, By Echo syllabled thro' Glade and Bower, To charm the willing and quick Ears of those, The chosen few, to whose high Faith far more Than mortal Music's given, such as rose On our first Parents, at the first sweet Evening's Close! 10 Earth wore a charmÃ«d Life in each fair Part, And Spirits sought her Bosom holily: The fond Creations of some dreamnursed Heart, That drew them from their bright Abodes on high To haunt old Wood or Stream, and cherish, by Such Commune, those pure Thoughts which ever shun The Fret and Fever of Man's Life, and die Allhomelessly, like Flowers denied the Sun, If tied to this dull Earth's so dusty Track alone. 11 But are these Fancies wild or waking Bliss? And where between them may the Difference lie? What we believe is real, and all else is As if it were not: so, so bounteously Joy's Seeds are sown in our own Heart, that by Itself unto itself it may be thence Sufficient: and thus quick and easily, Denied the grosser Joys and Goods of Sense, Draw still a selfderived and lasting Bliss from hence! 12 Is there no Wisdom save that of the Head? Has then the Heart no Wisdom? when with Eye Dilating o'er the Feast by Nature spread For her sweet, artless Guest, so lavishly, Thou seest the Child, whose Thoughts are Imagery Of Bud, and Leaf, and Bird, is he not wise? The truly Wise some Touch of Infancy, E'en when the Frost of Age upon them lies, Would still retain, and view the World with Childhood's Eyes! 13 They have no Time in Autumn's withered Leaf To mark the Emblem of Decay: far too, Too busy with Existence sweet and brief, To count them as they fall: or if they do Observe them, 'tis with sober Pleasure to Remark each brighten as it fades away: Drawing a Likeness, solacing as true, 'Twixt Man and Nature, who e'en in Decay, Prepares the coming Spring, calm and serene for aye! 14 Alas! the Poet's Visions seldom bless Our laggart Age, whose dull, dim, earthward Sight Can ne er attain such airy Happiness: For we are selfish Men: 'tis this foul Blight Has nipped the Buds of Promise, dimmed the Light, The better Light, which in Man's Heart doth feed, With its impulsive Warmth, all holy, bright, And upward Thoughts: this is the deadly Weed, Worse than the Brambles far, to choke up all good Seed! 15 The Dryads too, like frighted Nightingales, Are flown from all Earth's Groves, back to their Sky: Their Trees are all forsook, and the Wind wails 'Mid Leaves that now no more responsively Murmur their gentle Undersong: and dry, Their Founts make Music now no more among The vocal Pebbles, but with feeble Sigh Weep their last Drops away: the Nymphs are long, Long fled, nor mortal Ear now listens to their Song! 16 And ye, ye too, with them are flown away, Love, Faith, and Poesy: your Temples now Are desecrate, and Men no longer lay High Offerings on your Altars: on the Brow Of Saint and Prophet ye no longer throw Of Immortality the Reflex clear, Your Angelhands no more are seen below, Uplifting the dark Pall which wraps us here, To give us Glimpses bright from Realms beyond the Bier! 17 Aye, ye are flown away, and gone with ye Is that bright Ladder, by which Man could rise From Truth to Truth, stepwise, to God on high. That Ladder which appeared to Jacob's Eyes, With radiant Angels, 'twixt the Earth and Skies, Ascending and descending: but no more They come to commune with us here: Man dies Like the vile Worm: when Life's dull Farce is o'er, He's shovelled into Earth, and Time rubs out the Score! 18 Oh! ye that of all human Wisdom are The Perfume to the Flower, as the Seed Within the Fruit: who in yourselves do bear The Life of Life, without which we were dead, Unquickened, all Things else serve but to feed Time's fleeting Ends and Purposes, but ye Supply that Lore whereof the Soul has Need, Which wanting, we have Ears and Eyes, yet see And hear not, and still worse, know not our Misery'! 19 Alas! the Flowers on your Altars laid Breathe no celestial Perfumes: planted here For no eternal Blossoming, they fade, Scarce durable enough to grace the Bier, By Heavensdews unmoistened, therefore sere Emblems of quick Decay: touched by the Breath Of one wide Desolation, all that's dear Unto Man's Heart, is by the Scythe of Death Mowed down, like Summergrass, and as a barren Heath 20 The Earth is left, alljoyless, unendeared, O'er which with sad and weary Steps we go, Our Restingplace the Grave: and that too feared As the dark, drear Abyss, where we can know No Visitations of blithe Sunlight, no Glad Beatings of the Heart, no Thrill of Hope, The Tenement of Bones and Darkness! so Imagination (loving still to grope 'Mid Emblems of Decay, within the Coffin's Scope, 21 When she should soar into the bright blue Sky, Beyond the fleshless sculls and worms, which here Preach better far than both the tongue and eye Which filled those hollow Gaps,) hath stationed near The Tomb's dark Gates, the very shape of Fear, To scare us from our own dear Home: when none But a bright Spirit's form should hover there, The blessed Angel of Repose alone, To whom all secrets of eternal Life are known! 22 Why should we shudder on the dark Grave's Brink? One Step! and we are in Eternity, Beyond Earth's idle Uproar: and we drink With our whole Hearing the Sphereharmony, Which oft in Snatches, interrupted by The Jar of Passion and discordant Thought, Had reached us here below: we close the Eye, But for a Moment, and then back is brought, More beautiful, the Beautiful which we had sought 23 On Earth so long, and haply sought invain: More lovely than the Dream which hovered on The eyelids of our Youth: for all again Shall be restored to us, which, 'neath the Sun, Has brought the soft Tear to the Eye, or won A Recognition from the throbbing Breast: Yea! in the Darkness of the Grave not one Sole Truth is lost: that Darkness is at best The Veil which hides the Glory of our place of Rest, 24 Lest being suddenly revealed, to sight Unfit for such high Glories, it should make Us blind and desolate: to read aright The mighty Mystery, Faith's hand must break The seal, and in the unquenched embers wake Their wonted and primeval fires: the Grave Is not a bottomless Abyss: we quake Like children on its brink, because we have No Faith, no steady Light to guide us on, none save 25 That vain Worldwisdom, which, acquired here, Has served its turn, unfit to be applied Beyond the Limits of its narrow sphere: From which the glorious Stars in Heaven hide Their radiance: who circling in their wide And ample orbits, discourse to the eye And ear wherein high faculties reside Music most eloquent: unheeded by The herd, whose souls within them allunconscious lie! 26 The grave alone reknits the holy ties Which it hath severed, therefore is it dear To Love as unto Faith: no Spectres rise From out the fancied gloom, no shapes of Fear: To their calm, steady glance, the veil grows clear, And they can trace the shapes of coming Bliss, The foil of Nature's mighty Glass, which here, Like Echo, gives back merely that which is, Falls off, and all the Spiritworld, unseen from this, 27 Grows visible: like some fair Landscape shown At sunny Distance, from a Mountainsbrow: At sight whereof, deep yearnings, which had grown More absencestrengthened, gushing sweet, o'erflow The wayworn Pilgrim's soul: as far below He sees his quiet Home, embosomed deep 'Mid tufted trees: and all that he is now, And has been, rises on him, past Thoughts leap From Memory's Hidingplaces, as from Wintersleep 28 The flowers in Spring, and breathe upon the air The freshness and the bloom of early days, When young as they, he sported with them there In Peace and Innocence: the Grave betrays No trusts, no secrets: all that we may place Therein, if not corruptible, again Becomes our heritage: by Faith's calm rays The darkness is dispelled, the sting of Pain Plucked out, and scared all Phantoms of the coward Brain! 29 E'en Death himself assumes another form, In the void sockets shine an Angel's eyes, And for vile fleshless bones where crawls the worm, Imperishable plumage of the skies; No shaking hand its fearful office plies, Dartarmed and lank, but beckoning sweetly on He welcomes us: more like to Victory's Triumphant shape, than that Scarecrow of bone, That Skeleton, the sensual eye of Doubt beholds alone! 30 But ye are gone, Faith, Love, and Poesy: And the dark clouds beneath your skyward flight Have closed, and shut all Heaven from our eye; No glimpses of pure Ether cheer our sight, No Angle bearing your celestial Light Upon his Wings, descends in Poet's dream: No Glories burst the Pall of solemn Night, Shedding on Prophet's upraised brow a beam From God's own face; no more from out the Rock the stream 31 Of Truth, in this Life's Desert, springs. oh Woe! Oh Desolation! hark! the Veil is rent Intwain, as by th' indignant Godhead; lo! The Altarfire by viewless hands is spent, And with the ashes each bright spark is blent, Lost irrecoverably; from the Shrine Th' indwelling Spirit, which from thence had sent Forth Oracles, is fled, and that divine And beauteous Temple of high Art must now resign. 32 Its Sanctity, and be as common Stone, Its Pavement trodden by unblessed Feet, And by unholy hands its Statues thrown Down from their Pedestals; the Musesseat, Instead of that full Chorus, strong and sweet, Which like an Incense rose, from Voices blent In solemn Harmony, that well might greet Immortal Hearing, to the merriment Of Mammon's obscene votaries, (thither sent 33 To place their Idol in the very Shrine Where stood the Form of Beauty), echoes now: None comprehend the glorious design Of that vast Temple, for our souls are so Cramped in vain forms, so shackled to these low And passing hopes of Earth, that when we see The Perfect and Eterne, we no more know Or feel their Charm, we have no Sympathy Now with the True; and what is Beauty, if it be 34 Not Truth? or how can that man recognize The forms in which its Presence is made known, If to its high Proportions he applies The measure of his senses? can the Crown, That baubles a king's temples, sit well on Imagination's ample brow? can Thought Fashion a fitting home in crumbling stone? Or can eterne materials be wrought With fire by Inspiration not from Heaven brought? 35 Alas! for us; the divine Truth has drawn The veil o'er her bright face, lest we should see Her beauty, and, not knowing it, should scorn And mock Her; Falsehood is our Deity, And for our Gospel do we take a lie: E'en with our Mothersmilk into our veins We such the poison, and our Infancy, Like a distorted member, ne'er regains Its strength, and all that to our Afterdays remains 36 Of those fresh Years, so full of Love and Life, Of Sap and Promise of all blessed Things, Is but a Heritage of Sorrow, rife With Evil, but a Leprosy which clings To the sick Soul, and of its sublime Wings The Sinews gnawing, rots them to the Core; Then no more its immortal Chaunt it sings, No longer up the brightblue Sky can soar, But tumbling back to Earth, there grovels evermore! 37 Therefore no Highpriest for the Temple now Is to be found, no Soul that in God's Sight Is worthy on his broad and sublime Brow, The Seal of the Divinity, in bright, Unfading Characters, with divine Light Engraven, to receive â therefore no more The Choir with its long, fair Robes of White, Sweeping the Templespavement, as of yore, Is to be seen; no Lips that utter divine Lore, 38 With firetonguÃ«d Eloquence, like those Of Milton, are now heard: no Raphael now The Hues of Heaven o'er the Canvass throws, Calling the fair Skychildren down, to show The Glories of the divine Mansions; no Cathedralpiles embody in their vast Proportions an whole People's Faith, no Glow Lingers on Heart or Lip; the Days are past, When Faith and Genius, like Twins, abroad would cast 39 Their Wonderworks, impressing upon all They touched the Seal of Immortality! Upon each other they no longer call For Help and Consolation: to the Sky Genius no longer lifts his raptured Eye, No longer with the Chisel doth he wake The Marble into Life, Faith standing by, And whispering what Form the Stone should take! No longer from his Pen flow forth the Thoughts that make 40 The Universal Heart to beat more strong In all its thousand Pulses; on his Ear No longer steals the far off Angelssong, No longer to his Eye there starts a Tear Of Rapture, for both Love and Faith are sere, Sere as a withered Leaf: thus from the Tree Of Life all Verdure falls, the Sap which ere- While nourished it is dead, and sad to see, E'en as the blighted Fig Christ cursed, will it soon be! 41 Our Faith is as our Churches, dwarf'd into Chapels of Ease, mean, little, paltry, low, Embodying the Feeling whence they grew: Matters of Pounds and Pence, patched up as tho', In this enlightened Age, Men did not know How long God might be neededâas it were Mere Form and mere Convention: 'twas not so The old Cathedrals towered into Air, Men then had Souls to plan and Handsinspired to dare! 42 Faith and Imagination held the Line, And not the Bricklayer looking for his Hire! The Call they answered was a Call divine: The least felt something of that sacred Fire Which urged the Hand of Milton to the Lyre, E'en the Daylabourer! and as he wrought The brute Stone, still he toiled for something higher, The Hand responding conscious to the Thought, Which better than all Rules inspired him and taught! 43 But Faith is dead, Religion a mere Form: In Trifles oft great Changes best are shown, Our Curches must be comfortable, warm And matted, and our wordly Pride will own, E'en in God's Sight and kneeling at his Throne For Pardon, no Community with those Who're poorer than ourselves! we pray alone, Each in his Pew, which as an Emblem shows, By this its outward Separation, how Wealth throws 44 Like Barriers 'twixt Heart and Hear! not so Of old when by the Lord the Poorman took His Seat, and as in Fact, so there was no Distinction made! then haply from one Book (For genuine Nobleness will ever brook Such Contact, nor lose aught of Grace,) they read, As on one Bench they sat: but now we look At outward Things, we must not do as Head And Heart sublimely prompt, that were, forsooth, illbred! 45 The Hand must not be stretched out to a poor And illclad Friend, e'en tho' his Bosom were The very Shrine of Truth! we must make sure That he is dress'd in Fashion, that his Air Be modish, else he is unfit to bear The Name of Friend! the warm Words must not start Unto the Lip, nor holy Fire dare To light the Eye, we must take nanght to Heart, As if naught godlike in Life had or could have Part! 46 We must not even be supposed to know A poor Man, tho' he were a Milton, by A World not fit to lick the Dust below His Feet neglected: who still in God's Eye, Eating the Bread of Immortality In calm and sublime Confidence, toils on, One of his Prophets on some Mission high, Whom, like Elijah, ere his Race be done, He in a Firecar might fetch back to his Throne! 47 The Body must be cared for first, and then The Soul! we cannot kneel on the cold Stone As did our Forefathers, good, simple Men! They needed no soft Cushions, thought alone Of God, and therefore He too as his own Thought of them: for who feels and thinks of naught But God, he to whom this one Thought has grown Habitual, he for himself has wrought Out God! God then is near, yea! near as his own Thought! 48 Then let all have Him near, yea! near as their Own Hearts, by thinking ever on Him! so Will they avoid all Ill as if they were Led by His own Righthand, but there is no Â«As ifÂ», it is so really, as all know Who ever felt Him: for until the Thought Of Him enforces godlike what we owe To Him, 'tis not the Thought of Him, 'tis naught, For by that Thought the Godlike must be surely wrought! 49 They are as closeconnected as the Rose With its own Perfume; and what can, if this Cannot, produce the Godlike, or whence flows It then? and if this does not do so, 'tis Not the true Thought of God, for that is His Own Spirit, His ownself in us! and He Must work the Godlike to be what He is, In Himself, Man, the Flower, and the Tree, Tho' the Mode differ 'tis the Godlike equally! 50 What boots it that we mouthe from Day to Day Our Faithprofessions, if we still remain Thus hard of Heart? he who believes must lay His Sins aside, else his Belief is vain, It is not felt, and Feeling can constrain Alone to Action, godlike Feeling to Pure, godlike Action; now, I say again, He who believes the Godlike, he must too Feel it, and he who feels it must the Godlike do! 51 What saving Health can be in God's own Word When we so mince and lisp it, that thus by The fashionable Ear it may be heard Without a Yawn? when Vice, if decently Concealed, must be respected, and if high In Station, strong in Purse, may show his Face Where Virtue with an illmade Coat would try In vain to pass! when e'en God's Worshipplace Draws stronger still the Line which it should first efface! 52 But God is just; in vain the Rich make their Vicarious Offerings, who scarcely know The Name of Sorrow: the unmeaning Prayer Scarce reaches the cold Roof, for it has no, No divine Influence, nor draws below As by sublime Constraint God's listening Ear! But the poor Man whom Wrong, and Want, and Woe, Have left naught but a broken Heart, a Tear To offer, his Prayer, yea! ere uttered, God will hear! 53 And what is our Religion? she is now The Handmaid of the World, she fears it, to It is obsequious and bends her Brow; Not so of old with sublime Call she drew The Nations in her Train, for God spoke thro' Her Mouth, and as one with Authority She urged on and rebuked: then Men were true To her, for she was true to them, thus by The sublime Interchange they gained reciprocally! 54 Churches are not Religion, nor Police Morality, nor Vote by Ballot the True Freedom, if Men still to Prejudice Do Homage: they must first be good, then free! Mortar and Stone make not a Church, else we Should have enough, nor Bills of Rights free Men, Nor many Laws good Men! much, much must be Still added to all these, as to the Pen The Inspiration, without which 'tis nothing, then 55 Words kindle into Poesy, and dead Forms into Life, and Life to Harmony Divine! where one or two are gatherÃ«d Together in God's Name, tho' 'neath the Sky, There is a Church, yea! and a Church raised by The living God, himself its Priest! there where A Man has cast off Sin is Liberty, And where is one sole Law, the godlike, there Is a good Man and free, for more then needless are! 56 The Temple is before ye, there baptize Your Child in the first Stream, for God has bless'd The Water, and no holier Font supplies: There let him eat at that sublimest, best Communiontable, spread from East to West, Of universal Love the ungrudg'd Bread! Let him by holy Nature be impressed, Not with the outward Sign upon his Head, But with the inward, spiritual, in its Stead, 57 Deep in the living Heart! and from her so Grand Volume, where the Lord with His own Hand Has wrote in such clear Characters, that no, No Eye which reads, can fail to understand What 'tis he would forbid and what command, Let him be taught his Creed, and with each Day Turn over a new Leaf in that so grand And sublime Breviary, whence all may Draw golden Rules of Life, alike for Priest or Lay! 58 Thence let him learn, in its true Spirit, the So pure Religion of his Master, there Revealed so grandly, simply! let him be Taught it in all the Forms of this so fair And faultless World, where all Things, all, all bear A Testimony not to be mistook! Better is this than mumbling over Prayer, And conning Words by Rote from out a Book, Be ye yourselves the Hymn, as is the Bird and Brook! 59 Not that I disapprove of Churches and Of Prayerbooks, God forbid! I deprecate That Selfishness which paralyses Hand And Heart, and which, ere yet it be too late, I would see rooted outâ I reprobate Its Introduction e'en, alas! into The Holy of all Holies! at the Gate Of the eternal Temple therefore do I sit, and warn the Nations, to my Mission true! 60 My Tongue is not my own, and I am naught, 'Tis not my Voice that calls, oh God! 'tis thine! Jerusalem was freed by Blood, but Thought Is what I work with, and as more divine The Means, so higher is this Cause of mine! That was to win the outward Temple to The Cross, but mine the spiritual Shrine, The inward, in Man's Soul! and from a too Far worse Defilement than Mahometan or Jew 61 Inflicted on the palpable Shrine of Stone, Even from that of Mammon, who has there Cast down the Altars, thus to reign alone! Then sublime Thought! Thought subtler far than Air, Against whom is no Armour, who wilt dare To pass the guarded Gates of Kings, and smite Those who of God and Mercy have no Care, Be thou my Weapon, forged from Heaven's Light, 'Tis the Lord wields it, if I but direct it right! 62 Of old't was in the Firebush that to His People God appeared, but now shall He Reveal Himself more grandly! yea! e'en thro' Mankind's own godlike Heart, ye Nations, ye Shall feel Him, and as one Man moulded be In Christ, into one mystic Body, one Great Heart! and how should it not then be free; For who can bind it? and, whence it begun, Back to God's Heart 'twill go, when here its Race is run! THE SIBERIAN EXILE'S TALE. FIRST PART. 1 Oh! Love, if I should venture now to tell Of one who did thee honor, grant to me A Portion of thyself, a gentle Spell, That, like the Theme, my song may sweeter be. Nor, if heartreaching Faith be deemed fit plea, Wilt thou deny my prayer: for noble Deeds To those who cherish their pure memory Impart a portion of their Worth, which breeds Moods of high thought, and of like actions sows the seeds. 2 A deed of virtue is a thing of Beauty, And should be as a Householdword upon All lips, a Watchword for all Hearts, to high And noble Imitation â 'neath the sun There is no beauty like it; we may run The manyacted page of History o'er, And while Time's noisy Nothings do but stun, We linger on a Gooddeed evermore, And from it catch a spark of true soulquickening power. 3 A Gooddeed is a life of life, it shall Not perish â it has a Vitality Within itself: shall the Straybird let fall The Chanceseed, that had withered, on some high And manunclimbÃ«d Mountain, which thereby Grows verdureclothed? and shall not, with like care, Just Providence forbid a truth to die? Shall not some chancewinged words the good seeds bear Unto some human heart, and bid them take Root there? 4 It cannot, cannot pass to Nothingness! No, it shall be a Joy eterne to those, Whose souls have bowed not to the Littleness Of earthly things: who, 'mid these changeful Shows, Have kept their spirit's Oneness, which still flows, Like the songfabled River, thro' the Sea Of the World's Troubles, pure as when it rose From the deep fount of Truth, unmixedly Regushing 'neath a faroff Land's unclouded Sky. 5 And thou, thou Puredeed prompter, holy Love, To whom my Lip shall ever offer praise, Thou Source of all that raises man above His paltry self, and this vain World: our days, If thou wert not, were dark and thornstrewn ways, Leading athwart a Desert, where alone At thy sweet Bidding some Joyfountain lays Its freshness at our feet: to win thy crown frown! Martyrs have braved the flame, and tyrants' selfawed 6 And if the deeds, which do but shadow thee, Be thus allbright and holy, what art thou In thy own Essence, beautiful, and free From all Impediments, Conditions low, Changes of time and place, which here below Oft mingle with our Love, as smoke with flame, Dimming its brightness: thou, whose least Breath so shame. Sublimes the soul, that feeble woman's aim At times atchieves such deeds as put mail'd Warriors to 7 Thy deeds, thine perish not, for most of all They are the Heart's inheritance, a Lore Knit with its highest Instincts, and in small Space of sweet Selfcontent accomplish more (Spreading like circles everwidening o'er The charmÃ«d waters of a happy Life) Than mad Ambition's Rainbowscope of power, With means so infinite, if unto strife It were permitted aught of inward bliss to hive! 8 Thine is no thankless service, for therein Who loses, still has won a mighty gain, The conquest of himself, redeemed from sin And selfishness: a cure for his own pain In others' bliss he finds; not his the vain And unshared Joys of self, which barren die In our own breasts, blighted to weeds of bane. For Bliss from Heart to Heart, and Eye to Eye, Must be imparted, the fair Child of Simpathy! 9 There is a power in Love, which from life's woes Can fashion blessings, making itself wings From that which with dull leaden grievance bows A meaner passion down to earth; in things Of noble Natures and high Aspirings, It burns on like a pure, strong Altarflame, And all Impediments, all Hinderings, Herein consumed, give fuel to the same. Thus Love our weaker parts to uses high can tame! 10 Oh Love, thou burnest bright amid the snows Of bleak Siberia, as 'neath the skies Of sunloved Climes: thy holy Essence knows No diminution from Contingencies Of heat and cold: the Body's sympathies Affect thy Workings not: from these apart In th' human soul thou dwell'st, which never dies, Which place and time can change not: every part Of the wide world still offers thee a home, a heart! 11 Why should we limit thee to Time and Space? Are we not cooped within the boundaries Of this frail flesh enough, but must debase Thee to the dim perceptions of our Eyes And these dull Senses, making that which dies Measure of that which lives unchanged for aye, Finite of Infinite: of Harmonies How do we take the measure, of their Sway How judge? with th'outer ear or Soul's? let Memory say. 12 Can the ear keep them? does the passing wind Not bear them on its wings in mockery, To teach us that we have no power to bind Such Joys to outward sense? yet long passed by, Make they not far, far sweeter melody To th 'inner Ear in Afterdays, and bring Forgotten music, with all fancies high? Hence is it that old songs have power to fling Us back into the Past, cheating Time's baffled wing! 13 And Love? shall lesser priviledge be thine? Thou that art not a portion of the soul, But as the spirit of its inmost shrine, Each Being's Highest, and at once the Whole, From whence and whither, as to their one Goal, All Rays of Truth and Beauty tend: all things That, with or without Shape, have ever stole Bright Fancy's hues, all soulheard murmurings Of sweetest note, all Flutterings of yet unfledg'd wings! 14 Thou Love, thou art the Centre-harmony, From whence all lesser strings of Being take Their true Accord: from hence the outer Eye Receives its worth, and for the inner's sake Stores full the mind with Beauty-shapes: hence wake Old Songs such thrilling Echos on the ear, Which else were allinert: hence too we make Our hearts a portion of the changing year, And sympathize with Nature still in Joy and Fear. 15 Thou Love, hast ever been, and aye shall be, Best matter of high argument: fit theme For mightiest bards to show their Mastery; Soulstrengthening task, wherein, like some strong stream, That, as it flows, runs pure, they learn to deem Rightly of truths which thou alone canst teach: The Heart that works or writes thee wrong must teem With feelings to be pitied, nor can reach Its Best, as e'en the Rose! most punished in the breach 16 Against thy Majesty, oh Love!â for he Who has not loved has never lived: far more Unblest, tho' kingly Pomp around he see, And want for Nothing, yea! than the most poor, Doordriven, houseless beggar, if but sure That one eye looks on him with Love, that one Heart beats for him! oh! he who has been sore- Tried by the Loss of all he loves, has won A Bliss beyond him who has lost, and yet loved, none! 17 For unto him at least the boon of life Is not all Barrenness: he, like the flower Which to the fleeting winds its scent doth give, For other Hearts has hived his Being's store, Caring not when or how the passing hour Might rob him of his all, and leave him there, Withered and lone, of Joy to taste no more: Tho' Time might from his Soul its fond ones tear, Still must he love, to live, for without no Life were! 18 Oh Woman's heart, how beautiful art thou In thy deep, calm Intensity of Love! What is there on this Earth like thee? we bow Selfawed to deeds heroic, for, above The sphere of common spirits, they do move The soul to adoration: but, oh thou! So sole, that in the bosom of the Dove Bearest the Lion's strength, to thee we owe Heartworship, beyond all of Fair and Good below! 19 How different from Man's cold Love is thine, Which gives with Joy all for the loved one's sake! E'en Sacrifice itself grows Bliss divine: Denial is no more so, it doth take, (For Love's transfiguring Power well can make Things most opposed exchange their Qualities,) The Form of full Enjoyment: thus from Ache, Pain, Toil, can he bid rich Possessions rise, And where all wanting seems, the whole of Heaven comprize! 20 For is not Heaven Love? to live then by Love only, is to be in Heaven, is To live as do the Angels up on high, To live as God himself, for is not this His highest Priviledge, that Love is his Existence, his Godhead? yea! there is naught Without Love, neither Life, nor Heaven, nor Bliss! Then be your Hearts, like His, with Love but fraught, And ye will have at once the Heaven which ye sought! 21 But Man lives not by Love alone, therefore It is not Heaven unto him, as to Diviner Woman! she bows down before No other God, to this one ever true; But he has many Idols, changing thro' His Life: now from the Clarion would he hear His Name blown forth, now on his proud Brow strew War's or Thought's Laurels, now the kind Heart sear For some vain Helen of the Brain, to him more dear 22 Than her who sits beside him, who oft on Her faithful Breast has pillowed his sick Head: That Pillow heavenly Love might rest upon, And sleep as chastely as if Angels spread Their Plumage for his Rest! alas! instead Of seeking for his Poetry in his Own Life, like Woman, Man by Fancy's led Astray, oft leaves, sick of such divine Bliss, The Helen of his Dreams for some vile Harlot's Kiss! 23 Thus Extremes meet again: and there he lies, Grovelling amid the Dust, 'till, sick once more, He shakes it off his Wings, and to the Skies, E'en to God's Throne itself, anew would soar! Strange Contrast! now with Angels to adore The God of Love, and now profane him by Coarse, prurient Lusts, degrading in a Whore! Alas! that earthly Films should dim the Eye, And Passion fire the chaste, pure Lips of Poesy! 24 Happy he, who has that sublimest Skill Within the Framework of the Picture by Imagination wrought, thro' steady Will, And sober Keeping open of the Eye, Broad, broad awake, alike to laugh or cry, The living Forms around him to comprize: To see things as they are! that is the high- Est Way, it is God's Way: and to God's Eyes, Methinks, far fairer than the Poet's Dreams must rise! 25 For God falls not asleep and dreams not: he Is broad awake: what Dreams could e'er supply To Him that which His waking Eye can see, His waking Heart can feel? then let us try To do like Him: to see all Things as by Him they are seen, as godlike! and then where Is he who needs to dream? then Fancy, thy Fastidious Hand may crown with Flowers the Hair E'en of our mortal Love, and find the true Muse there! 26 And if from Love, deep, lasting, and sincere, We draw our Inspiration, can there be A higher? comes it not direct and clear From God himself? and who then, if not He, Is the one Source of Life, Love, Poesy? Then cleave unto thy human Partner's Side, In her Form shall the Muse appear to thee, Urania, not she whom erst the Pride Of Poet feigned, a higher far shall be thy Bride! 27 Yea! one of God's own Spirits, in whom He Himself dwells with thee: in thy House! so near! Keep her as such then, let her never be Aught in thine Eyes but godlike: never hear Her Voice but as if God himself in clear, Intelligible Wise, spoke to thee, by Her Lips: then really He'll speak to thee here, And treating her as godlike, she thro' thy Treatment will grow so, and make thee so equally! 28 Love is of all her Children justified, And God accords to perfect Purity, A perfect Strength: a Strength which doth reside In its own Innocence: a Mystery Was, in the birth of Him whose mission high Redeemed the World, unveiled to man's dim sight: A truth illknown, yet one that could not die. From a pure Virgin's loins came forth the Might, That flamelike withered Falsehood, and put Hell to flight! 29 God's ways and means are many, and by those Which oft to man's blind, erring Judgment seem The most unfit, he in his Wisdom knows To perfect that he wills: one divine Beam Of Truth dispelled, as daylight does a dream, The monstrous Pile of Superstitions: made The Sword's of twenty Legions idly gleam, Like brittle Reeds: and in its Meekness bade The proud Schoolwisdom of the stubborn Stoa fade! 30 With that which is not he can bring to naught The Things that are, and put to utter Shame The Glories of this World: nor wills he aught That men deem needful to work out his aim! Nor strength of Nerve or Sinew, Sword or Flame! Not such brute Agents hisâ all these are weak, For o'er the Soul no inward Sway they claim; The chains they forge an Infant's hand can break, Things only like themselves of dust their slaves they make! 31 With Wisdom meek as Childhood, nourished by The Milk of Innocence, doth he delight To prove the Wisdom of the Flesh a Lie! For Truth is one: but the Worldsteachers fight Together, seeking her celestial Light In dim, earthkindled Lamps: nor doth he deign With mortal Weapons to assert his Right! 'Gainst the skytempered Armour these are vain, Which shields Truth's divine Breast, from whence they fall again, 32 Shivered to thousand fragments: while the arm, That dealt the blow, is paralyzed, as by The sudden Working of a mighty Charm; Nor seeks he his Apostles 'mong Earth's high And favored Sons: these to a barren Lie Would turn his Word, and make it a mere Screen For Creeds, Forms, Priestcraft, and Statejugglery! Therefore on Poverty fair Faith did lean, And Hand in Hand they went, in Courts full seldom seen! 33 Therefore God chose the lowly and despised To do him Service, and above the Throne Of Kings he raised them, He etherealized Their Natures, gave their Lips that mighty Tone, By which, on the four Winds, his Word was blown Abroad unto the Ends of Earth; He sent Them forth to teach that Innocence alone Is Strength: that to her Nakedness is lent Skypanoply, not forged by mortal Instrument! 34 Why did He not stretch forth his mighty arm, And, reedlike, snap intwain the fullblown pride Of those that mocked him? why not with the Charm Of one sole word lay prostrate far and wide The Hosts who in their Nothingness denied His wise Omnipotence? or why, ye say, Ye moleeyed Seekers, who cannot abide Truth's radiant brow, who find your only day In doubto'er clouded night, by false pride led astray, 35 Why with swift Thundervengeance did he not Work out his Ends, and force the stubborn Will Of Sinners to his Faith? ye Fools! ye Blot On the fair page of Wisdom's book, to Ill Who turn the gifts she gave ye, ye are still The same old Serpentbrood, that with the Slime Of its Fooldoubts has toiled the Truth to kill! God has for all his Ends his own good time And means, tho' ye do turn his Wisdom to a Crime! 36 Yea verily, I say, such Miracles He could have worked, if Need were, or if Good Had come thereof; and his own History tells Of even-such, that yield a sensual food To vulgar Faith, which, to support its Mood, Asks for these palpable signs: but the wise Mind, Whose Faith on such frail basis has not stood, Will seek its best proofs, not in Shows that bind The outward sense, but fuller Revelations find 37 In the deepworking, sensehid Agencies, Which to rightthinking minds do yield most high And sweet Astonishment. Allgood and wise, By simplest and most despis 'd Ministry, By humblest Means, he perfects noiselessly Mightiest results, that bring man 's pride to naught. He is no Wonderworker for the eye! Hearthomage asks He by brute Fear not bought, And Freewillofferings by Love, not Wonder wrought! 38 Yea! verily, the Thunders are his own, The Winds, and Lightnings, and the mighty Sea Are at his Bidding, and with these, 'tis known, He can work Miracles! yet still there be, Far greater, marvellous exceedingly, Where Strength and Force are not, save such as lies In Truth and Wisdom's selfdrawn Mastery. With these he can o'erthrow the Mockeries Of steelclad Hosts, and put to Shame his Enemies! 39 Yea! with a simple Truth he can put down The mighty from their seats, and humble Kings By the despisÃ«d means themselves disown: Thro' the Babesmouth refute the Questionings Of the Worldwisest: and with meanest things Confound the Mightiest! yea, He alone With weakness can bind strength; to the Dove's wings Impart the Eagle's Might, and make Pride own Himselfby Lowliness subdued, by Worth despis'd, unknown! 40 There is a Strength, which dwells not where the Worms Are called to banquet, which far deeper lies Than in these perishable outward Forms Of nerve and sinew: nor by aught that dies Does it reveal to man its mysteries, Tho' over these it has a godlike sway! Its Shrine is in the Soul, and from the skies Thither descending with its pure Liferay, It keeps the Spirit young, tho' Grief the head make gray! 41 When these frail Limbs, on which disease and pain Have done their worst, fall one by one away, Like faithless Servants: when Earth's weight again Lies heaviest on us, still this hidden ray Maintains its priviledge: e'en in the clay Remingling with the dust, its Birthright lives, Still gaining strength by meaner things' decay: Allconquering Death of his worst Fears deprives, And o'er the Grave a sober Victory reapsâ and gives! 42 This is true Strength: too deep for outward Show: Too vast in perishable forms to be Made manifest to sense: no Emblem low Of Earth can grasp its bright Immensity, As little Thought can grasp Eternity! It is the Soul of things, and felt, not seen. Therefore those basest Thralls, those Thralls of Eye And Sense believe it not: had Christ but been A Giant, he had gained more Votaries far, I ween! 43 Had he, cloudthroned and thunderarmed, among Earth's senseled sons appeared, or sent before Wonder and Fear his Messengers, the throng Had bent beneath him in the dust, with more Than slavish baseness: but a higher power, In its own simple Majesty, that made Conquest of Will alone, left to persuade Itself, not forced, and by no Proofs, no Lore, But those which to itself, without Parade, The soul supplies, on brute Force leaning not for aid, 44 But working soft as dew within the flower, And fecundating by Love's warmth alone The seeds of high Belief, to them such Power Was allincomprehensible, unknown, Unfelt, unrecognized, a Glory thrown On the unconscious Clay, which still remains Brute and unvivified: the Strength they own And worship, is mechanic, that which strains Sinew and Nerve, and by brute Means brute Ends attains! 45 But ye, ye blessed few, ye Innereyed, Who see into the Life of things, whose Gaze, Quiet and calm, looks thro' the forms that hide The mighty Workings of the Eternal's Ways From grosser sense, ye find best cause to praise And glorify His name, whose Ministrings Are felt thro' all, where others cannot trace His wondrous Hand: the smallest Flower betrays To ye that Wisdom, which so gently brings In its vast Grasp the Issues of all earthly things! 46 Ye see it not alone, when forced upon The dullest Mind, in grand Events, that shake Realms to their Centre, and eclipse the Sun; Ye would not stare when Paralytics take Their Beds up, or when buried Men awake, So much as ye do at what every Day Ye look on! greater Wonders far, which make No Noise, but still as Thought, wrought ever; yea, The Thought which from God works on in Man's Heart for Aye! 47 Controlling, punishing, correcting still, Like to a viewless Arm laid lightly on The Necks of Kings, and to a higher Will Bending their haughty Schemes, of which not one Works out that which 'twas destined for alone. Thine are the Wonders, God! thou thrself, by And in Us', work'st them as if not thine own; Withdrawn from View, in sublime Modesty, Thou mov'st all, yet still as thy least Star in yon Sky! 48 Ye trace him always, everywhere, in all, Because most in yourselves, ye chosen few; In most familiar Things, however small, Ye feel him grandly, there Allmighty too, In the least Sandgrain and the Drop of Dew, As in this whole, vast World! Ye see him draw From warring Falsehoods the eternal True, Make Discord serve the selfsame End as Law, And Peace and Love spring like Twins from the Womb of War! 49 This World his vast LaborÃ tory, where Experiments are ever going on Upon the grandest Scale! now to a Hair To regulate a Comet or a Sun, And now unerringly to solve some one Of Life's grand Problems! while, as Ages fly, In Time's vast Crucible remains alone The one eternal Truth to test all by, Good, Good alone endures, like God, unchangeably! 50 Ye know what Strength is: by the running Brook, And Faith was Sampson fillÃ«d with the Might Of Hosts, to smite God's Enemies; a Book, With a few worlddespisÃ«d Truths â the Light Of high Experience, gathering strength by Right, And its own inborn Majesty of Worth: A feeble oldman's Words, who at the sight Of axe and fire swerves not, can give birth To mightier Issues far than all the powers of Earth! 51 This is true Strength, whose chosen home is still The Soul of man, when with himself at one, His Being's End he strives but to fulfill In meck Lowheartedness: which dwells alone In that which Chance and Change have never thrown Low in the dust: which Time assails in vain! In an old Song its Essence oft is shown, In which the eldtime Spirit lives again, And in all Forms kept pure by Soul from earthly Stain! 52 Thinking on such things, need we wonder still, That Love, tho' in a feeble Woman's breast, Can draw from pure resolve and fixÃ«d will, The strength to execute the high Behest Of the Soul's Oracle? all times attest That there be Wonders, tho' no more the dead Rise up to prove them from their tombÃ«d Rest. Faith still can work them as of old, when need May be, and Love, twinborn with her, has equal Meed! 53 Oh that my Lips might with the Altarflame Of Truth be purified, thus, with all good And fitting Utterance, to sing thy Name, Thou Worth of Worths: thou that deriv'st thy food From noblest sacrifice of each low mood, Each selfish feeling: 'till the soul, left clear From sensual stain, the Image of its God Full, mirrorlike, gives back! Oh be thou here, Prompting my feeble Song, descend from thy calm Sphere. 54 Ye Elements, that wage eternal Strife With man's frail Handyworks, and seek your prey In his Highplaces: that which draws its life From what yourselves are made of, ye may lay Low in the dust, and after its brief day Of brute-existence to Oblivion Consign for ever: strewing thus your way With aweinspiring Ruins, which Truth's sun Gilds for a Moment's Space, like Motes, and lo! they' regone! 55 Nor will the wiser mind mourn o'er the fall Of Tower and Temple: nay, draws thence a Kind Of holy Solace: Spiritvoices call From out the eldtime ruin, and the mind In the Past's Echos stronger proof doth find Of its own infelt Immortality! Faith dwells with us, an Eye among the blind, Looking before and after! Centuries fly, The outward form may change, the spirit still is nigh! 56 Itself it is the Form: the Form is naught Without it â and where it is not, there is No Form, for by the Spirit that is wrought. It moulds, etherealizes, now in this And now in that Shape, Man still after his Great Archetypeâ it glows, and casts away The Dust of Agesâ and tho' we may miss It for awhile: lo! with diviner Ray, In Book, Thought, Deed, and Word, it shines, godlike for Aye! 57 Its home is the cloudpillared Firmament, From God it comes, to God returns: below 'Tis man's best Heritage: that spark unspent, From whence her Torch Faith kindles, which can throw Light thro' the darkness of the Grave: on woe, And human suffering: and has a power O'er Nature's lifeless forms, until they glow As with a Soul. Winds, Flowers, Ruins hoar, Bring haunted Memories, and dreams of days of yore! 58 'Gainst this, ye Elements, in vain ye strive, Nay, rather ye subserve thereto, and make High Memories holier still: for ye do give Tradition unto Truth: and for the sake Of our Forefathers' deeds, we love to wake The voice of eldtime songs, that in the heart Of Nations have their home: ye may downshake Freedom's Strongholds, but'tis not in your art, To dim the Truths, that from her Wrecks, like Spirits, start! 59 Above the timeworn Ruin hangs the Power And Beauty of departed Years: it seems Like Something taken from the passing Hour, And having naught to do therewith: strange Gleams From Suns long set shine on it, and the Streams Rustle, tho' real, as in a Fairytale! It looks like something visioned in our Dreams, Standing apart: ghostlike seems Hill and Dale, And as Ghosts we glide on, 'till Comprehension fail! 60 Ye fleetdestroying, conquestspurning Waves, Strew the foamcradled Cities of proud Kings, Like Autumnleaves: let the Winds o'er their Graves Leave less Trace, than man's Memory to things Of meanest note accords: ye Tempestwings Scatter the Conqueror's Boasts unto the Dust, From whence they rose, to which their nature clings With downward Baseness: thou, steelgnawing Rust, Feed on his vain Warspoils: ye Snails, deface his Bust! 61 Thou Time, Destruction's Playmate! thou Headfoe Of earthencumbering Records of dark Deeds, Built up with human Blood, and human Woe! Reaper of Ages' harvests, o'er the seeds Of high Truths watching, Rooterout of Weeds Which Crime and Folly nourish: Critic sure! Tester of Systems, Sects, Religions, Creeds! Winnowing the vile Chaff of the passing Hour power! From the good grain, which springs, sureripened by thy 62 Haste to the widespread Feast which Man prepares For ye, ye Harvestreapers of the grain, The everspringing crop of foolish Cares And fruitless Toils, of Ignorance bred: the vain And outward pomps, wherein high Truths disdain To linger, seeking still a fitter home, In the few chosen hearts: outliving Pain Hate, Persecution, Change, and Error's Gloom, Like Torches handed down, 'till happier days may come! 63 Hurl to the dust the topless Citytowers, Skypointing Columns, and all mockeries Of clay and stone. Worth has far other powers Than these: far more enduring Testimonies! Ye cannot wrong the Truth; her Enemies Are but as clouds unto the sun, which tho 'Tis hid awhile from man's dimsighted Eyes, Shines not less bright tho' hid: yea, even so, Doth Virtue free her from all Contact base and low! 64 But to my tale: far 'mid the snowclad plains Of bleak Siberia, where Tyranny, Who wages Warfare with his dungeonchains, With fire and sword, against Truth's majesty And Freedom, sends his foes to pine and die: Breathing the breath of shame and banishment, Far from all Homeendearments, where the Eye Shrinks at the joyless scene, to which is lent The heart's own Hopelessness, from which no smileissent, 65 There dwelt a banished family, whose fate Was less heartsearing than is oft assigned By the lynxeyÃ«d Monster, who by hate And fear metes all offences: for the Mind, When it has that it loves, will solace find: And they were severed not, but in their woe Heart beat on kindred Heart: and thus entwined, Like Ivytendrils, could support a blow, Which, striking singly, must have laid each torn Branch low. 66 The sorrows which we share with those we love, Which prove how they do love us, these, these have A power beyond e'en Fortune's smiles to move A deep, sweet Selfcontent: for as the wave Will surfacefoam and break, when tempests rave, While Ocean's heart beneath sleeps calm and still, So in man's soul, what outward Ills it brave, There is a Centrepeace which naught can kill, A Joyfount which from Love and Faith itself doth fill. 67 Husband, and wife, and daughter, they did live Soullinked together in Adversity, As in their former Joys: and still life's hive Might have been honeyfilled: for to the high, Selfcentred spirit, in its unity, Changes of Time and Place, of outward things And Bodycomforts, are but mockery: 'Tis selfsufficient, and the soul has wings, Whereon it soars away, and far off pleasures brings. 68 Spirits there be, that with the sober Eye Of truediscerning Wisdom, glancing o'er This pleasureteeming World, can yet deny Themselves, and without pain all other store Save what they bear within them: ask no more Than that small sum, which frugal Nature needs, Of food and raiment: and like some sweet flower That blooms unto itself, where no foot treads, They live to their own hearts, spurning the World's false creeds! 69 With allunsparing hand they cut away The prurient Wishes, the rank Growth of vain And whimborn fancies, which so thick o'erlay And clog the Soul's free movements: drawing Gain From that which unto feebler minds is bane And selfconfusion: like the o'ergrown vine, Whose wild Leafwantonness does but restrain The precious Fruit, 'till needful Wounds incline Waste strength to knit in clusters for the generous Wine. 70 The wiser heart still gathers inwardly The lifesap of its being: ripening To selffruition, selfdependency. And as the bird on evenmotioned wing, So it from all the downward bents, that cling To this low Earth, can free itself, and rise To higher aims: nor from its Eagle-swing E'er stoops unto the Carrionprey that lies In mad Ambition's path, whereon he gluts, and dies. 71 Our Joys are likest halfsunn'd fruits, which grow On one side harsh, illflavored, sourhued, On th' other overripe: alas! we know Not when to pluck the little that we could! We will not when we can, and when we would, Time is beforehand, lets us not twice chuse; But once he offers, then takes leave for good. Thus Nature's gifts Foolwisdom doth abuse, And misses all, by grasping more than he can use! 72 But he, the Father, he was nursed elsewhere Than in that sober School, Selfmastery; He had not learnt its Wisdom, nor could bear To be worldsevered: tho' he still had nigh, Truehearted, those to whom the soul may fly For solace 'gainst the cold World's bitter hate, 'Gainst fickle friends, and outward misery; He would not seek the bliss his present state Might yield, nor learn what Time all teaches, but too late! 73 Warcradled and strifenurs'd, his school had been One where the soul, selfstolen, is left bare In worse than nakedness. Oh who can glean A Peacesheaf from the bloodsown field of War To store Life's Wintergranary? what are The Battletriomphs, the eyedazzling Sheen Of banners and sunglancing spears, that mar God's holy Image: what the Afterscene, The Deathpause, and the deathstrewn Earth whereStrife has been? 74 What are all these (save that reality Makes them more dreadfull) but a feverish dream Of some sick, nightmared couch, which, when passed by, Leaves the soul without Power to redeem Those Feelings which the wise alone esteem Aright, of all good Growths the Root and Sap. Its Peacetastes are destroyed, it will not deem Itself its Wealth; longnursed in Strife's rude Lap, Wisdom's low Voice charms not who loves War's Thunderclap! 75 The Clarion has untuned his Ear for sounds Of gentler note, discharmed the Homefireside With its few chosen hearts, within whose Bounds, However scant they seem to largeeyed Pride, Most ample realms of Happiness reside; And harvests, golden harvests, of that Grain, One little Sheaf whereof, in all his wide And barren fields, Ambition reaps not: Gain Like this is not for him, he sows War's field in vain! 76 But Woman's heart within itself lives more, And in her Homeworld she can happy be, Loving and lov'd: from Nature's founts her Lore Instinctive flows, she drinks it fresh and free From those deep wells of pure Humanity, The early Loveexchanges, which endear Cottage and fireside: as round the tree The weak grape twines, so woman's heart will bear Its Joyfruits still, if some supporting heart be near. 77 And if she have Ambition, it is still To rule the Heart, which she so well doth know In all its weekday movements; nobler skill Than that, which seeks in greatness still to grow By Sacrifice of all that here below Is best and dearest, to the World's turmoil And hollow vanities; from whence can flow Heartaches, Heartbarrenness alone, the Coil Offretting hopes and fears, which each high Impulse spoil. 78 But man 's thoughts are elsewhere, and home to him Is but the Cage 'gainst which he wounds his wing With fretful Effort, 'till his heart grow dim In fancied Thralldom. Pride, Ambition, fling Their Darkness on his mind, and vain dreams bring. He, like the Oak, must cast his arms abroad Into life's tempest, 'mid its deafening, Heartsickening Uproar take his Part, with Word And Hand still strive to make himself obeyed and heard. 79 So it befell this man: shorn were his beams By the first cloud of passing misery, And his soul darkened by Despair's vain dreams Of Pleasures past and Sorrows yet to be. In his own heart he bore the fount of free And joyous thought, but knew not his own power To strike the Rock and bid it gush, for he Walked in no selfdrawn Light: the passing Hour Shone on, and left him as it found, all Clay once more! 80 His wife and daughter, they lived in the heart And by the heart, careless of outward things, Which they missed not: in Love they breathed apart From vain regrets; and he who loves has wings Of Eaglescope, fit for high Aspirings To that calm Atmosphere, where earthly fears And cares vex not: in all his Wanderings, Love has one Centrepoint to which he steers, One Haven sure whence Angelwelcomings he hears. SECOND PART. 1 And now, my own Soul's Sister, Prascovy, Let us wend on our Way in steadfast Wise, For the Lord's Hand is on thy Purity, And in thy Weakness is He strong: arise And doubt not, for the holy Mysteries Of God to Faith's calm, steadfast Glance are clear, An high Astonishment, a blest Surprise, Shall ope his Heart who lends thy Tale an Ear, And Rays of Heaven's pure Light oft cross his dull Path here! 2 And I would fain believe, tho' all divine, Thou, in whom Love thus ripened into high And perfect Faith, (for of Religion's Shrine Love is the Cornerstone,) that even I Possess that Faith whose Hand of Purity Still touches into Glory common Clay, And on the Brow of poor Mortality The Stamp of true Divinity doth lay, By Time and Sorrow uneffaced, the same for aye! 3 Tho' Art should fail, unable to renew The Forms of eldtime Poets, forced to take Casts from the antique Statues, Nature, true To her creative Priviledge, can make In her eternal Mould (tho' Time should break Her Masterworks to Pieces one by one) Fresh Beautyshapes, which unto Being wake Perfect as Eve, by Sin not yet undone, Her Mould remains the same, tho' endless Forms be gone! 4 And on thee has she tried her mighty Hand, Her choicest Craft, thou new Antigone! Tho' no blind Father, treading Grecian Land, Leans on thee, not less beautiful than she: Tho' one with all the Sheen of Poesy, The Atmosphere of Beauty, the Goldlight By Inspiration breathed, o'er mantled be, And thon in Nature's simplest Garb art dight, Yet fairer than all Pomp, for Truth is thy Birthright! 5 Thou tread'st no Poetground, no Legends hoar Hover around thy Head, nor do 'st thou seem Fit Subject for the Bard's fastidious Lore: No Oracle, (save that celestial Beam Within thy Heart,) no goldenwinged Dream, By high Jove sent, sheds Glory upon thee, But on Life's common Path, where ill Sights teem, That shock the nice Regards of those who see With Fancy's Eyes, an Angel in thy Purity, 6 By Faith upheld and meek Lowheartedness, Thou trod'st, on Misery's scant and bitter Bread Oftnourished, and the salt Tears of Distress! Oft without Pillow for thy weary Head, Or Friend, save one above, tho' He instead Of every earthly Aid might well suffice, Yea! the good God by whom the Raven's fed, Altho' he has no Voice to ask, who tries The Heart of Man, and by high Suffering purifies, 7 Entering into the Temple when 'tis made Holy by Expiation! even He Who in his Mercy and his Love hath said, Â«Blessed are they that suffer, they shall be Inheritors of ImmortalityÂ»! Who gives most e'en when most He takes away: Who takes the good Things of the Earth that we, Thus wean 'd from them, may not be led astray, But Faith's good Things receive instead, and live for aye! 8 Thou trod'st Life's thorniest Paths, yet murmuredst not, And 'mid its Fret and Fever thou wast still Calm and content, and envied'st no Man's Lot, O'ercoming Evil by an ardent Will, And a fixed Soul of Good, which can instill Into opposÃ«d Natures its own Worth: Rousing Men's inert Sympathies to fill Their wonted Channels, and by very Dearth Of earthly Means, prolific in those not of Earth! 9 The more of Mammon's Means the less of God's! The more of outward Things the less we here Use spiritual: on the Reed that nods With the least Breath Man in his Hour of Fear And Doubt will rather lean, on palpable, near, And present Aids, how frail soe'er, than on Faith's viewless Arm, which more than Sword or Spear Can bear a Nation up! this Strength alone Endures, for being Spirit Change in it is none! 10 But Mammon scarcely can relieve Wants to Which this frail Flesh is subject: he may pillow The Head on Down, yet Conscience still can strew Unquiet Thorns! he can but feed the low And sensual Propensities, but no Inspiring Breath to aught Godlike supply; Hr cannot stir Mens' Hearts, or bid Kings bow As to God's Voice, when inlymoved as by Some heavenly Presence, which their Souls dare not belie, 11 They hear a friendless Girl ask Mercy on A Father, in the Name of him whose Grace Hes led and visibly before her gone! This is Faith's Priviledge: he who will place His whole Trust in her, by no Fears debase Her Impulse, or by brute Mistrust undo Her Triomphs, he all Ills unmoved shall face, By her and in her shall he conquer too, For ne'er breaks she her Pledge to those that love her true! 12 But he who leans on her, as on a Reed, And trusts her not, 'neath his Weight will she break, For she will not support the earthly, dead, Unquickened Pressure of brute Doubts, that make The Soul distrust itself, and from it take The Sceptre of its spiritual Sway: And he who seeks her not for her sole sake, But thinks by Mammon's aid to smooth the Way, His Toil is lost, in Mammon's Service must he stay! 13 But to thy steady Worship Faith could naught Refuse, she tried thee, and then led thee on To thy far Journey's End, smoothing, like Thought, The Difficulties which Earth's Power alone Could not o'ercome; thy lofty Goal was won By that same Spirit which has Strength to move The Mountains, and which stayed the Middaysun Over Jehosaphat, for from above With Might of Hosts it comes, yet meeker than the Dove! 14 And Actions full of Beauty, like to thine, Are far beyond all Meed of mortal Praise And mortal Guerdon: being alldivine Their Worth Earth's vulgar Wages would debase, Tarnish and sully their celestial Grace, In their uncomprehended Beauty therefore, Like Angels with a Veil drawn o'er their Face, They pass unguerdoned 'till their Toils are o'er, Unrecognized, save by the few, to reap the Store 15 And Fullness of all Bliss at God's Righthand! Celestial Things are measurÃ«d alone By that which is celestial, who has spanned With an Ellwand the Rainbow or the Sun? And Virtue were not Virtue if unknown And unrewarded she were not the same, If toiling not for Love, but Wages won Like Mammon's Hire, if Obloquy and Shame Could make her once forget from whence her Glory came! 16 If like the Sons of Earth she needs must have Base Compensation and Indemnity For Loss of earthly Goods, ere she will brave The Perils of her Mission: verily There be some who of Immortality Would make a Bargain between God and Man, Turn Virtue into a deformÃ«d Lie, And with brute, worldly Cunning dare to span That Wisdom which composed the allembracing Plan! 17 But verily they have their own Reward, Their Light is Darkness, and by it they're led To Selfconfusion: ever on their Guard 'Gainst Trick and Guile, by Trick and Guile they're fed, 'Till to all nobler Food their Taste be dead, Foxes 'mong Foxes, Fools among the Wise! And as, when by Man's Hand the Net is spread, The Brute's low Cunning ill with Reason vies, So too the Toils of these are Folly in God's Eyes! 18 And now, my Prascovy, wouldst thou but aid My feeble Lip to tell thy simple Tale In calm Simplicity, with no Parade Of dazzling Metaphor, whose Arrows fail Full oft to hit the Mark, tho' flowery Dale, Groveshaded Streams, and Voice of Summerwind, Be wanting to my Song, with Stroke of Flail And merry Vintageshout, still may it find Impulse and Utterance to please a kindred Mind. 19 Do not the Hills give back the Voice of Man When flung abroad at Random, tho' they be Of brute, insensate Earth? Heaven's wise Plan Binds all Things with the Chain of Sympathy, Heart answers unto Heart, tho' they may be Severed by Seas and Mountains, Thought with Thought Still communes, Soul with Soul, they mingle free As Sounds in Air, and from all Things is caught The Voice of one, sole Truth, if rightly it be sought! 20 Behold her! this young Angel! where and how? Pride look thou on her, yea! look down and see Her who finds Favor in God's Sight: tho' low Her Dress and Gait, bespeaking Poverty, Yet no mean Being be assured is she, God's Eye is on her, tho' she knows it not, A Saint, tho' Crown and Jewels wanting be! On her poor Head a Wheatsheaf has she got, Contented with the Gleanings of a Beggar's Lot! 21 Yet not less beautiful, methinks, is she In this mean Garb, by Patience triomphing And calm, pure Faith o'er mortal Misery, Nay, lovelier, for 'tis 'mid Suffering That to Religion's Altar Faith doth bring Celestial Fire, to kindle thereupon The grosser Elements that bow her Wing To Earth; behold! her coarse Daytasks are done, And homeward she returns with yon' slowsinking Sun! 22 She has ne'er known another Fatherland, Or if she has, in earliest Infancy, It is an unremembered Being, and E'en the bleak Iceplains to her joyous Eye Are beautiful: she throws o'er all the Dye Of her own happy Heart, her only Woe To see her Father's Tears, and not know why He weeps; unseen, herself had seen them flow, And hers, because she could not bid his cease, gushed too! 23 And often, when the soft, dreamwingÃ«d Sleep Stole from her Eyes Life's passing Scene, arose Her Father's Form, within her Breast so deep Had sunk the Wish to heal his secret Woes, So strong her Love; for she was one of those Whose Forms to beautify Humanity Nature unto Man 's wondering Vision shows From Time to Time, like Rainbows in Life's Sky, Or Angels 'mid its Storm and Darkness passing by! 24 Behold her! on the Threshold now she stands, Full of her Thought, but as she lifts her Eyes, She starts, her Gleanings fall from her young Hands, For lo! with mingled Terror and Surprise, Her Father, pale and gloomy, she descries, Her Mother bathed in Tears, and knows not why. Sudden her Father's Grief bursts forth, he cries, Â«Behold my Child (so spake Impiety) Given by Heaven's Wrath to fill its Measure high!Â» 25 Â«Wasted by servile Toils I see her pine Away before me, and a Father's Name, To me a Synonym of Wrath divine, Is as a Curse, a Heritage of Shame!Â» Thus spake he in his Bitterness, with Frame By Passion shook! illjudging Man! for she, Who like the Rainbow mid the Tempest came, Mingling her Tears with his, was sent to be His Guardianangel here, from Bondage to set free! 26 And thus it is, when Heaven 's Hand is nigh, We push it back, unknowing what we do, When God is nearest to our Misery, Our Souls are most estranged! yea! even so, Poor Worms that lift their petty Stings, and throw Their Vemon up to Heaven, charging on The Giver of all Good each Wrong and Woe Which our own Folly or Man's Hate upon Our Heads hath brought, as tho' God bade the Ill be done! 27 And from that Day the Soul of Prascovy Was stirred with one high Thought, and as the Wind Drives all the Waves with one same Tendency Before its Breath, so in her deepstirred Mind An Inspiration rose: each Impulse blind, Each Thought and Feeling, with a sudden Light, And a fixed Bent of high Resolve refined, Gathered to one same Point their scattered Might, And like concentred Rays upon her Path shone bright! 28 Then by calm Faith unfilmÃ«d were her Eyes, And from the Bosom of Futurity She saw the Vision in its Glory rise, Not faint and dim as to the doubting Eye, Seen thro' the Mists of frail Mortality, And suddenly withdrawn, but firm and clear As when before the Throne, her Mission high Accomplished, she knelt down in Awe and Fear, And felt she had no more to do or ask for here! 29 One Day her Prayer was over, and awhile With Soul o'ersteeped in Blessedness, e'en there Where Heaven had opened in a radiant Smile, Revealing the calm Realms of upper Air, The Mansions of the blest, still in her Prayer Absorbed she knelt: her Lips moved not, her Brow Calm as a Summersea, for all Words were Vain Sounds for what she felt, all Utterance low, God was in her and from God did her Being flow! 30 Then, like a Lightningflash, a Hope came o'er Her Spirit, with a sudden, dazzling Gleam Of Blessedness: awhile it troubled sore Her inmost Soul, as when from some glad Dream, Too lovely for Reality, where teem Celestial Sights, we wake, but soon it drew Her into its blest Sphere, and like a Beam Melting in Sunlight, so did she renew Herself in that deep Joy, a Being calm and true! 31 And in it did she live for evermore, And by it did she live: Thought, Feeling, Deed, Sprang out of it, as Perfume from the Flower, Refined and purified, from all Soil freed, And fit to mix with Ether! Self was dead, One Thought was Present and Futurity, She had no Life but in it, asked no Meed But once to see it realized, then die, That Thought! to free her Parents from Captivity! 32 Like to a Revelation of God's Will This Thought flashed on her, like a heavenly Ray Which all her inmost being did o'erfill With Light, and soon she knelt again to pray, But Words came not, she knew not what to say, For Bliss o'erpowered her! her Soul alone Existed, but her Body was away, The one to Earth, the other to Heaven was gone, And for a while it seemed that this brute Life was done! 33 And when she found her Voice, amid the Press Of mighty Thoughts, she pray'd God fervently Not to deprive her of the Blessedness Which then she felt, so indefinably Filling her Veins with liquid Ecstacy: All other Things she left (herein most wise,) To his good Time and Place, with mortal Eye Not daring to peruse Fate's Mysteries, With mortal Reason fearing to direct the Skies! 34 And often, when around her houseless Head The Clouds of Sorrow gathered, that same Thought Upon her Path its eldtime Radiance shed, Dispelling Mists of Doubt and Fear, still fraught With Blessedness, as then when first she caught Its Inspiration: like the dawning Ray, It grew and grew in spite of all that wrought 'Gainst its Omnipotence, 'till in Broadday All Things o'ersteeped in its celestÃ¬al Radiance lay! 35 It seemed as if the Heaven's Glory still Mantled her Form, an Angel from the Sky, Whose Beauty Earth's dull Contact could not kill! Great Nature too inspired her, and by All natural Forms she schooled the Ear and Eye To teach the Soul: to those who learn to see In her the Shadow of the Deity, She makes high Revelations: they are free To hear God's Voice upon the Winds that past them flee! 36 And oft amid a silencehaunted Wood Of antique Growth, beneath the chequered Shade Falling in dappled Flakes, in holy Mood Of solitary Musings, had she made Her Sodjourn, 'till allconscious Nature bade The Earth lift up its Voice in Awe and Fear And speak of God: listening the while she stayed, 'Till forth unconsciously she broke in Prayer, Feeling one God within, around, and everywhere! 37 Thus (her own Soul her Oracle,) she grew Unto the Bloom of fifteen sunny Years, Like an halfopen Flower which the Dew Of Heaven, working silently, uprears, 'Till this one Thought the Source of all her Fears And Hopes was grown, the very Breath whereby She lived! 'twas this which e'en to Suffering's Tears Imparted Rapture worthy of the Sky, For Love can turn e'en Pain to purest Ecstacy! 38 Where Selflove rules, there of all Good is Dearth! For lofty Things are born of Sacrifice, Yea! 'tis the Sacrifice that gives them Worth, And makes them what they are! then if thou'rt wise, When that which of all Things thou most dost prize Is at thy Hands required, thou will there- At be rejoiced, wellknowing that the Skies Will thro' thy Heart tenfold the Loss repair, By making God more truly thy one Good! and where 39 He has become so there is little more To wish or seek for! and this Good is one Which thou canst not be robbed of: but, before This greatest of all Blessings can be won, Thou must have brought thyself to think of none As comparable with it, to feel this Worth every other Good beneath the Sun, And if thou really feel'st that so it is, Then 'twill be really so, and none of these thou'lt miss! 40 But mere Word-faith, without the living Deed, Is worth far less in the Allgiver's Eyes Than is the future Fruit within the Seed: The perfect Man in every Creature lies As Growth in that, and what the changeful Skies And Elements accomplish for the one, Faith works out for the other: she supplies Thro' the Belief therein that Power which none But they who live by Faith from Faith have ever won! 41 And Truth if we sincerely seek her, to Her divine self ourselves assimilate, Will herself be our Recompense, the true- Est, best, for she will perfect us, create The godlike Heart, by being made too great To think of Pay best pay'd! but doubtingly Received, (as simple Food spoilt Stomachs hate,) Her Nature changes then avengingly, And the Soul draws from her the Poison of a Lie! 42 Oft had she visited the chosen Wood, A natural Temple, framed by Nature's Hand For simple Worship, and that selftaught Mood Which in her Forms adores the Love that planned This goodly World, in its least Parts so grand! A great Artificer is Nature! she Builds in true Taste, her Works in Beauty stand Simply sublime, from those vain Changes free, Which in all finite Wisdom 's ever needfull be! 43 Here would she pray within the simple Aisle, Pillared by Treestems branching up on high Into a shady Leafroof, whence the pale And greenish Light fell on her upraised Eye: The Wind lowwhispering, as it murmured by, A natural Music suited to the Place, No proud Display of Man 's vain Melody, Tickling the Ear when he should bow for Grace, With haply some Bird's Note, to break, but not efface, 44 The holy Quiet of the stilly Air, So soothing to the Soul, when allalone It would hold Commune with itself, and bare Its inmost Wishes, kneeling at the Throne Of Mercy, and in Meekness calling on The Heavens for Aid. for she had formed a Plan, (And what we trust we can do is half done.) By Love inspired with that Faith which can Impart prophetic Powers, and make the Will of Man 45 Rockfirm and fixed! for when the Anchor of His Hope is cast into Futurity, No passing Tempest of Time's Sea can move The Lifebark riding calm and quietly Amid its Uproar! thus Man's Will, which by Frail Passion's every Wave and Breath is blown, When it has bent its Energies to high And holy Ends, is not upheld alone By mortal Powers, when pure God makes the Cause his own! 46 And what so pure as hers? can Angels feel A purer Love than that whose deep Roots grow In a Child's Breast, which for a Father's Weal Would sacrifice each cherished Hope below, Refusing thro' all Grief and Pain to know A single Joy save that of Sacrifice? Whose Love thro' Life's cold selfish Sea could flow Fresh as the Fountain when its Waters rise, Without one bitter Drop, one Stain in its pure Dyes! 47 Love is the Well of Blessedness, not sweet Itself alone, but making too the Taste Of each Bliss doubly so; unlike Earth's fleet- Ing Joys, which, when the first Sweet is effaced, Like Poisongoblets honeysmear'd, and placed To lure us on, behind them leave for aye The Bitterness of Death and Sin! then haste To this Elysian Fount, of which all may Drink largely, then let all do so, for far more, yea! 48 Than Pegasean Fount, can it inspire To all high Thoughts and Deeds! now to the Wood Her Path she traced, full of that one Desire, And after praying for due Fortitude To Him whose Grace imparts all that is Good, All holy Thoughts and Inspirations clear, That He would please uphold in her the Mood Of calm, unswerving Faith, that doubteth ne'er, When all seems Doubt, nor fears when all gives cause for Fear, 49 Homeward she turn'd, with firm Will to address The first of her dear Parents she should meet, But as she neared the House her Heart, did press Its Prisonbars, for on the Doorsideseat, Placed opportune to catch the Middayheat, In such a Clime no Idler's Luxury, Her Father sat: tho' overhead no sweet And beeloved Sycamore rose shady by It. as in sunnier Lands, with fanlike Majesty, 50 Where Age may sun himself, and blithe Youth sport Life's sweet, brief Holyday away in Peace; Selfmastering her Fears, and cutting short All Doubts by timely Action, she did ease Her Heart in Words, and ever by Degrees Her Speech grew warm with that sweet Eloquence Which pleases without studying how to please: For what the Heart prompts ever is good Sense, And oft a godlike Call, for God's Voice speaks from thence! 51 She pray'd her Father's Leave that she might go And ask his Pardon of the Emperor, Where, In his Pride and Pomp, by Neva's Flow Of icy Waves he sits, upon whose Shore, (Almost dreamswift), a barren Waste before, Th' Imperial City rose: a helpless Maid, Worldignorant, and, save in Faith, most poor! Yet oft the weakest Vessel Heaven hath made The Medium of its Revelations, and arrayed 52 Its own invisible Powers on the Side Of Innocence and feeble Womanhood! Not with the Warrior's Arm, nor with the Pride Of Sword and Spear, doth Heaven work out the Good It has in View, nor wills one drop of Blood Be shed in aught to which its Agency May be vouchsafed! but oft in gentlest Mood, Like the Springsbreath, we feel its Power nigh, Filling all Things with Life, Peace, Love, and Harmony! 53 Oft has the Majesty of Innocence Atchieved what Nerve and Muscle could not do, Oft worked a Miracle upon the Sense Of hardened Guilt, 'till Consciousness would flow Of something before which all Strength must bow, On the crimedarkened Soul: a Babe's weak Cry, As 'twere God's Voice, has stayed the Murderer's Blow, Yea! it is God's own Voice, for he speaks by The Babe's Lip, and in perfect Innocence is nigh! 54 There is a Weakness far above all Strength! Its Power in calm, enduring Faith doth lie, Tho' baffled oft, its Triomphs come at length, E'en as the Ice is soonest melted by The gentlest Breath, not by the Storms which ply Destruction's Task, allpowerless to create! This Weakness has no Pride nor Vanity, 'Tis meek and fearful, tho' of high Estate, But Pride is frail, for he his Strength doth overrate, 55 Selfconfident where Wisdom takes most Heed! Therefore the Lord delights exceedingly To make a Pillar of Strength of the frail Reed, By Weakness to put down the Proud and High, And turn to naught by meek Simplicity The Wiles of Craft! there is no Thing so low, So despicable in Ambition's Eye, But he can hallow it to Good, and show By it that Hosts are needless to him here below! 56 Yea! thus He works his Miracles, by Means Worthy of that He is, the God of Love, Of Truth, and Mercy, while we Men, by Scenes Of Strife, Destruction, and brute Uproar, prove That Nerve and Sinew cannot lift above The Beasts that perish! wonder not then ye, (For not the Eagle but the gentle Dove Was missioned for the Olive) when ye see God's Wisdom working by this Maid's Simplicity! 57 Older her Father far in reckoned Years, Yet but a Child, the merest Child indeed, Compared with her: for not by Days or Years Faith measures Man's Perfection! Flesh may need Seasons and Times to ripen, like the Seed, In its brute Fashion, but the Soul is free At one bold Bound, by perfect Will selffreed, To leap at once into Eternity, And to anticipate what shall hereafter be! 58 She was beyond all Years, all Age, all Time, As old as Love and Truth, and they were born Before this Earth, and in a happier Clime! Her Father's Date was but as he had worn This fleshy Husk, 'twas young, now old, and shorn By Time of its first Bloom: but she, oh she Had lived the Life that dyeth not, had torn The Veil from off the Future, and could see The Shape she was to live in everlastingly! 59 A greater than Medea thro' her Veins The true Lifeessence had infused, the high, Calm Pulses of eternal Life, from Pains, And Doubts, and Fears, set free, allequably Beat in her Bosom, and she could not die! Time could not bring her Wisdom who had learned The Lore already of Eternity! Nor perfect where no Flaw could be discerned, Nor yet reward whose Wages were already earned! 60 That godlike Selfcontedness had she Which of all other Blessings here below Is the Beginning and Epitome, In which they all are centered, even so As the Rose into its ripe Bud doth throw The Essence of its purest Energies! Naught had she, yet had all Things! asked for no Increase, yet had that Wealth which multiplies The more the more'tis used, and which all Wantssupplies! 61 Oh blessed Thought! to think that in our own Soleselves we have all that which we require! Thus nourished on Faith 's daily Bread alone, The Goods of Earth to her were but as Mire! Ether unconsciously did she respire, She was an Angel to herself unknown, Rich beyond Wealth, and blest beyond Desire! Thus without Search and Effort had she won The perfect Treasure, which is every Good in one! 62 Such was the Being who now prayed in vain Her Father for Permission, but he made Light of her fond Request, and she in Pain And Shame burst into Tears: not that afraid She felt herself, tho' no Voice spoke to aid Her Prayer: for all their Anger she had come Prepared to meet, but Ridicule betrayed That Weakness which still finds a secret Home, When for its other Shapes the Heart will make no Room. 63 And now the Roses of three Summers more Had mantled on her Cheek, and Womanhood Gave to her Purpose Strength unfelt before: It had grown with her Growth, and was the Food Of all her daily Thoughts, and oft she would Repeat her former Prayer more earnestly; Chidings and Ridicule she had withstood, For ever a still Voice within was nigh, Which cheered her, whispering that her Hope was not a Lie! THIRD PART. 1 She was not skilled in Learning as 'tis taught In Colledges and Universities, In all the idle Nicknames with which Thought Is labelled by those Bookapothecaries, Logic and Metaphysics, Husks where lies No Soul of Good; true Wisdom still will thrive Without these, Love more than their Place supplies! And Â«he who made the Lips and Heart can give Wisdom and EloquenceÂ», that noblest, how to live! 2 She had no Booklore, and was little wise Save to Salvation, yet the Soul can make Itself an Education from what lies Around it, keep its Faculties awake By Things at which the Bookworm scarce would take A passing Glance: Life has a living Lore Not like that of dead Books, and they who rake The Ashes of the Past may pore and pore, Yet learn not half so much as from one acted Hour 3 Of what Stuff they are made, what capable Or not to do: true Wisdom does not lie In the much Knowledge, but in knowing well: Oft in much Knowledge is much Vanity, 'Tis but an inert Mass, unquickened by That Love which puts it into Act and Use For God's high Praise; there is too frequently A Pride of Knowledge leading to Abuse, And to Hearthardness Faith all Grace doth still refuse. 4 That she had Wisdom in the truest Sense, They who know what the Gospelpreachers taught Will doubt not, Wisdom free from all Pretence, Childlike in its Simplicity, and fraught With that Meekheartedness so vainly sought In the proud Schools of Earth's Philosophy. He who, according to his Means, in aught Relieves a Fellowcreature's Misery, Is wise not unto Time but to Eternity! 5 Fulloft the Words of Life seem meaningless In the broad Glare of Earth's Prosperity, But in the Darkness of our sore Distress The Soul is forced to seek internally A Strength not yet put forth, obscured oft by The Pomp and Glitter of the World: then on Our Sight the Lifewords shine exceedingly, With a celestial Radiance, unknown Before, like Phosphorwriting when Daylight is gone! 6 The Wisdom of the Earth is as the Earth, After the Flesh, and filmy is her Eye, It looketh not beyond her Place of Birth; The Earth is very cunning carnally, And he whose Wisdom cometh from on high Would be a Jest and Mock to the worldwise, His Wisdom Foolishness! how can Earth by The Earth embrace the Spirit's Mysteries? God's Truths to carnal Comprehensions turn to Lies! 7 And Wisdom to be Wisdom must be sought And loved for her own Sake, else of her Lore The Spirit will evaporate, and naught But Dregs remain; one sole Seed from the Core Of her Hesperian Apple is worth more Than all the Fruit beside, for in it dwells The pure Lifeessence: like the genuine Ore, When made a Traffic of, her Principles Are mixed with baser Stuff and earthly Particles. 8 Unto the World the Gospel was and is A Stumblingblook: the carnalminded seek Wordwisdom, vain Display, and so they miss That pure Illumination which the meek, Being fit, receive, and the World's Strength is weak To strive with Foolishness: for strong Desire And Wish to comprehend alone can break The Seal of God's high Truth, which, like the Fire, Cleanses true Gold, but burns the drossy in its Ire! 9 Three Years had flown, and Time, who severs oft, Had twined the Tendrils of their Hearts more close, And Love, whose sweet Breath can make sweet and soft E'en Bondage's bleak Air, had soothed the Throes He could not heal, and thus the Thought to lose Their only Daughter, when Oldage drew on With his accumulating Load of Woes, Sickness, and Pain at being left alone, Wassnapping the last Thread Life's frail Hope hungupon! 10 And oft, when in their Sor row they would pray Her not to go, she answered but with Tears, For her Heart coul not find to say them nay, Yet her firm Purpose bent not to their Fears: As Water Drop by Drop the hard Rock wears, So did the Minutes one by one remove, (And with their paltry Space Time builds his Years, And makes and mars) all Obstacles that wove The Net of Difficulties, rent intwain by Love. 11 Yea! for Love's gentle Touch is mightier far Than that of strongest Giant, and can make A Host recoil, if such her Course should bar! The Gordian Knot of Hindrances, which shake The Warrior's Will, which brute Strength cannot break Asunder, she undoes in gentlest Guise, Naught can resist, all Things for her sweet Sake Lose their worse Natures, of her holy Eyes One Glance can conquer him who all brute Force defies! 12 Behold her by the Streamside, she has done Her hard Daystask of Washing at the Brook, And she is stooping down to place upon Her Shoulder its moist Load. Pride do not look So scornfully, as tho' thou couldst not brook Such Things, illsuited to fastidious Ear: Of human Life, not in a giltedged Book Of fanciful Romance, thou readest here, The Trappings are cast off, that clearer may appear 13 The godlike Outline in its sublime Truth! Nor can, I trust, Time quench entirely The holy Fire that warmed the Breast of Youth: And Form and Custom tho' they dull the Eye And Ear to Life's real Scenes that 'round us lie, And shut us in a hothouse Atmosphere Of sickly Prejudice and Vanity, Yet cannot conquer Nature, still the Tear Of Pity Chance calls forth, tho' dull, cold Hearts will sneer! 14 After some Cross-signs and a mental Prayer, She was about to take her Load, when lo, One, whom she knew, stopped short, and with an Air Of Mockery accosting her, said, Â«so Now of itself your Linen Home would yo, Had you but made a few such Trifles more:Â» Thereat, for tho' a Fool he was kind too, He placed on his own Back her Load, and bore It to the House, not thinking on his Speech before. 15 Arrived, he boasted in his Pleasantry Of having saved the Girl a Miracle, For being half a Sceptic, he must try His Wit on sacred Things, which Fools love well To turn to Jest, tho' why they cannot tell; Poor Wretches! they are to be pitied more Than else, for, like the Clapper of a Bell, They but repeat what Fools have said before, 'Tis the Beast's Nature, Bell or Fool, so pass it o'er! 16 They are but as the Child by the Seaside, Who digs his little Trench, nor doubts that he Can compass in its paltry Space the Tide; So these Men, who before their dim Eyes see The mighty Ocean of Eternity, Can comprehend it not: all that they view Is some small Fraction of Infinity, Some Sandgrains which they weigh, and yet these too To Wisdom prove as much as Suns and Worlds can do! 17 The vast, capacious Intellect looks on This goodly World, and being itself wise Can trace the Wisdom in its Workings shown: The Heart that looks abroad with Love's quick Eyes Can trace the Love that framed the Earth, and plies Its daily Tasks in sublime Confidence! But here nor Head nor Heart we recognize, They mock their Maker with the vain Pretence To hide from others and themselves their Want of Sense! 18 And such was this Man, yet rebuked he stood By Wisdom speaking thro' the Lips of one Whose Mind was simple as her Heart was good: Who by her Piety would fain atone For Evil, tho' 'twere by another done; And thus she spake, Â«could I do otherwise Than place my Trust and Hope in God alone, Seeing that He in thee hath made arise A Servant to his Will, whose Will thou do'st despise?Â» 19 Thereat abashed the Sceptic quick withdrew, All his gay Rhetoric and Fence of Thought Foiled by an artless Girl, whose Lip ne'er knew A single Witstroke save what Truth had taught; And many an Example, if 'twere sought, Would History afford, to teach us how E'en with the Fool and Sceptic God hath wrought The Glory of his Name, turning the Blow Aimed by Impiety to lay the Smiter low! 20 Catching within the Net himself had spread Th' Ensnarer's Foot, and thro' the Mockery Of Scoffers raising up a Cause nigh dead; For in the moral World's Machinery (Whose Movingimpulse comes but from on high, That regulates vast Spheres, least Atomies) A counteracting Principle doth lie, And Foeattempts, as 'round the Circle flies, Prepare the Way for Truth's most glorious Victories! 21 E'en as the Earth transforms the Filth we throw Upon her Bosom into goldeared Grain, So from Man's Crimes and Vices there doth grow The perfect Growth of Good; he toils in vain, To Selfconfusion, selfinflicted Pain And Misery, save when he works with God, A mightier Power his Efforts doth constrain, And Men and Nation's Sufferings surely goad Back to stern Duty's Path, when they forsake her Road! 22 Oh mark his Wisdom, yea, observe it well, Working vast Change by simplest Agency, Selfregulated: in Man's Heart doth dwell A comprehensive Principle, an high, Corrective Spirit of Humanity And Justice, oft obscured, extinguished ne'er: Thus Man by Man, and Nation ever by Nation is judged, thus are we forced to bear Selfwitness, to selfpunish every Crime done here 23 Acknowledging it just by our own Deed And proper Act! nor can we inculpate Our Maker, for ourselves have sowed the Seed Whose Crop we reap in Bloodshed, Guilt, and Hate, 'Till Humannature, roused, doth reprobate Its own Misdeeds, and on itself doth call For and inflict due Sentence, every State Is subject still, how greatsoe'er or small, To universal Conscience overlooking all! 24 All Men condemn in others Sins which they Themselves are guilty of, thus each is by His own Lips sentenced when he goes astray; And this pure Spirit of Humanity Speaks as invested with Authority, It summons Nations to its Bar, and there Foredates the Judgment too of the Mosthigh, Nay, it is his own Voice, for if it were Not, it could not do so, nor that high Office bear! 25 God does not punish us as we believe: Evil and Good are at Man's Choice, his own Will makes them, his own Hands the Threads still weave Into the fatal Lifewoof, he alone Dyes them, with his own Deeds! black, blue, or brown, Or bloodred, as may happen, as they leave Fate's Distaff one by one, for all at first Are white as Innocence! tho' he may groan, And rail at Fate, and call himself accurst, Yet by himself and no one else the Seed:âare nursed! 26 Evil is like the Earthquake, calm and still, In the Earth's Bosom cradled, lo! it lies, As a Babe on its Mother's Breast, untill The Elements supply it Force to rise In Action, then at Havoc's Call it flies Forth to lay waste, and level Tower and Town! So in Man's Breast, 'till he himself supplies The Fuel, and the Breath by which 'tis blown, His Deeds the Fuel, and his Will the Breath alone! 27 Or this Illprinciple within Man's Breast Is like the Tigercub from Infancy Handfed, and reared up as a tame Housebeast, The Babe may play with or beside it lie: But if Blood wet its Lip, with sudden Cry Instincts that slept awake, and terrible The Wildbeast glares with furyflashing Eye! The first bad Thought to this Illprinciple Is as the first Bloodtaste, and breaks the fatal Spell! 28 Then take ye Heed to think no ill, for Thought Is the first Germ, and without this is none: No Finger can be lifted up, nor aught Said or but looked, unless a Thought has gone Before: the ripened Fruit that hangs upon The Bough, the Bough itself, the fullgrown Tree, All are but an Unfolding of the one Small Seed, then tame thy Thoughts, or they will thee, Still as the Seed was first the Fruit's Taste too must be! 29 Thus of all Ill is Man himself sole Cause, But yet 'tis passing, Good alone can be Eternal, coming from God: for still his Laws Uphold and give it a sure Victory; But he who with the fearful Ministry Of Crime and Guilt would make ill Things to thrive, Calls a dread Spirit from the Abyss, where lie The dormant Elements for Mischief rife, To work with his own Will'gainst his own Peace and Life! 30 But if he labour for God's Wages here, Not in the frail Works of Man's foolish Pride And vain Imaginings, he need not fear: A mighty Champion is at his Side Who for his Fellowcreatures has denied Himself: the Spirit of Humanity Avenges and upholds, his Works abide, For not in Time but in Eternity Their Base is cast, and they the Elements defy! 31 And ye, ye filmyeyed, whose dull Moleken Cannot embrace the wide Horizon of Eternal Truth and Wisdom, ye, who when Ye see a Steammachine almost selfmove By the brute Aid of Springs, extol above The Skies this wonderful Invention, by Which Man's creative Powers ye would prove, Yet cannot trace the vast Machinery Of moral Causes to a Source beyond the Eye! 32 Ye Fools! when ye behold a Steammachine, Ye trace it to its Maker, and with high And sounding Names pronounce him half divine! And what is this fair World to Faith's clear Eye But a like Piece of vast Machinery, Only incomparably grander and More perfect? where not one least Spring is by Time worn away, nor aught demands the Hand That made it to improve the least, least Thing it planned! 33 Where, from the Glowworm to the Stars, all is As when he first created it, where tru- Ly all selfmoves, not needing even his So sublime Hand to alter or renew! The Clouds float onward thro' th' eternal Blue, No one knows whence or wither, and in the Vast Workshop, from the Framing of a Dew- Drop to the Darkening of Suns, does he Prepare and foresee all, yet Himself none can see! 34 And yet all feel him, all, down even to The least, least Heart that beats! all, all save ye, Who feeling Him not, therefore feel naught tru- Ly or sublimely, for since in each he Its Highest constitutes, how can it be Save thro' Him known or estimated right? Therefore in all this lovely World ye see Him not, nor trace Him in the Stars by Night, Too vast the Characters, too dazzling for your Sight! 35 Yet there his Name is writ more legibly Than the Word Â«GodÂ» is in the Prayerbook! yea! So much more so that e'en the Infant's Eye, Who from his Mother's Lip has learnt to pray, Ere he can spell the Words he is too say, Can read it there as nowhere else! in no, No Book, however eloquent it may Show forth his Praise! but ye cannot spell so Well as the Child that Name, tho' much ye' ve read and know! 36 Ye very Fools! what is your Ignorance But Impotence of Heart and Mind to see And feel what is so clear? all is but Chance And blind Result to your dull Sight, for ye, Being reasonless yourselves, think it must be More reasonable that the World should know No Ruler, than that, harmonised and free From Contradiction, all Things should be so, So grandly made one supreme Being's Power to show! 37 But e'en of ye is Wisdom justified, As of her better Children, ye do show That Ignorance is still the Root of Pride, If for no higher End ye live below: The Wiseman points ye out, as by ye go, Like the poor drunken Helot, to deter From such brute Imbecility, and so Wisdom is even with ye, tho' to her Sweet Voice the Driveller's Bray your Assesears prefer! 38 And now I leave you to the scornful Sneer, The Jabber, and the insane Mockery, With which ye would assail me, could ye hear This most deserved Rebuke: tho' ill can I With my weak Voice uphold the Majesty Of oftinsulted Truth: she does not need A Weapon from my scanty Armoury, One Glance of her calm, sunbright Eyes can breed Dismay and nerveless Fear, and like a windshook Reed 39 Her base Foes quail when retribÃ¹tive Light She flashes on them, and like Chaff they're blown By her calm Breath into Oblivion's Night! From ye I turn to one whom she doth own, The purest Jewel in her starset Crown, If not the brightest: others there may be More dazzling, to the vulgar Eye made known By Gloss and idle Splendor, yet is she The calm, clearlustred Gem, from Earth's least Flaw quite free! 40 Which will support the microscopic View Of those who put no Faith in the proud Claims Of human Virtue, for the Heart is true, And thence a steady Brilliance (not the Flames In sudden Snatches, with which Passion aims At dazzling the Beholder) but calm Light, Pure Centralfire, is thrown: Virtue which shames Those showy Efforts, a vain World's Delight, Which on its wide Stage love to strut in all Men's Sight! 41 Six Months had taken Wing, since, happy Day! She saw the Messenger depart, who bore Her Father's Prayer to Tobolsk: who shall say How her Heart beat? the Summertide passed o'er, The Peasant gathered in his Winterstore, And Time, who ripens all Things, saw again Their deepest Sundyes on the Corn, before The Messenger returned: oft would she strain Her Eyes along the Road, and watch, and watch in vain! 42 Oh Bitterness of Hope delay'd, that takes All Charm from Ear and Eye, she could not see How the green Wheat grew gold, or how the Brakes And Flowerbanks reechoed to the Glee Of Bird and Insect, with the Ministrelsy Of the Hedgecricket rang. Spring, Summer sped, Setting Bud, frozen Grass, and Flower free, Kissing the Apple's Cheek to rosy Red, And strewing in the Path where Winter's Step must tread 43 The Year's ripe Glories! but she saw all this Like one who to its Joy is not awake: She marked not how the Summer's quickening Kiss Worked on the young May, saw not the lean Snake, Long unsunn'd, creep from out the ferny Brake, Nor counted by the Cornear's deepening Dye The Hours, nor heard the Breeze the Wheatsheaf shake: On Hope's unrÃ«al Breath she lived, not by The present Atmosphere, but in Futurity! 44 At length, oh joyous Thought! the Answer came: Hope longsince chilled within her Father's Breast, Nighspent 'mid its own Ashes, with faint Flame Burnt up, tho' but enough just to attest That still it lived, then sank again, opprest By Certainty: for tho' the Letter said That Tyranny's strong Hand dared not arrest The Daughter being free, yet well he read In its fixed Silence that all Hope to him was dead. 45 The bitter Drop was poured into the Cup, And it ran over: Hope is sweet, altho' More baseless than a Dream, for Flowers spring up Wheree'er his Summerbreath has leave to blow, And none without that Breath on Earth will grow: Still in Reality's harsh Atmosphere They fade: the Future with Hope's Seed we sow, And hoping for the Fruit, e'en tho' it ne'er Should ripen, by that Hope enjoy it Year by Year! 46 Her Father took the Passport, and he said She should not go: but the Heart's Augury The inmost Thought writ in the Face can read, And there she saw that, selfunconsciously, He cherished still a Hope that would not die. Therefore she Solace took with her own Thought, Not questioning God's Will too curiously, Since to its Consummation he had brought Thus far her Hope, and for her visiby had wrought. 47 And she did well to trust to him who reads The Hearts of Men, and shapes as they arise The inmost Thoughts, and quickens all the Seeds Of Good within the Soul that still relies Upon his Mercy, who unfilms the Eyes, That Good and Evil unto them may be Made clear; for he who doubts alone descries Clouds and thick Darkness, and then laugheth he In his own Heart at those whom Faith has taught to see. 48 He says, Â«all is but DarknessÂ», even so To him it is: but from the Point of View Whence we should look, all Things to Order grow, We see Link joining Link in Union true, And God's allpresent Wisdom reaching to The smallest Fibre of the Web; the Eye Of Faith alone the dread Handwriting knew, And carnal Wisdom stood abashed, when by The Voice of Daniel spake the Wisdom of the Sky! 49 One Evening as the Twilightshadows threw Their lengthening Forms along the Earth, these three, Father, and Child, and Mother, sought to woo Oblivion to their present Misery, Cheating their Thought to seem awhile to be That which it was not, and therein most wise: For after all Man in his Thought is free To be that which he will, with Fancy's Eyes We may transform Life's Waste into a Paradise! 50 Thought itself is Eternity, for thro' What Means save this can we be so? its Scope Is boundless, Thought alone is us, thus tru- Ly we are what we think! and sublime Hope (Not like the earthborn Antic, wont to grope Amid its Dust, and laugh at us when we Hape clasped a Shadow) to our Sight can ope Glimpses into a calm Futurity, And taste the Joys to come from all Mutation free! 51 That sublime Hope which changes not with Things Of Earth, but down from Heaven, like the Sun, On Man's else guideless Path its calm Light flings, By Mists undimmed; all else is Dust alone, The Victory soon or late by Time is won: He dulls the Edge of earthly Joys, and takes The Bloom from our young Years, strews Thorns upon The Pillow of our Rest, and like the Snake's Envenomed Tooth, when cherish'd at our Hearts, he makes 52 The deadlier Wound, with treacherous Injury Repaying our Foollove of Things so base! He takes Delight to give our Hopes the Lie: Each apish Morrow wears a double Face, One wrinkled sere, the other full of Grace And winning Smiles; thus still he lures us on, Till Hope with his swift Step no more keeps Pace, Then leaves us in our Misery alone, To count and comment the last Sandgrains as they run! 53 The Moon had risen, o'er the sickled Corn Her soft, calm Radiance fell, where here and there The goldeared Sheaves lay piled against the Morn, When the blithe Reaper should return to bear The Residue away; the scarcestirred Air Seemed to bring with it Summer's dying Breath, Barely uplifting in his leafhid Lair The Owl's Breastfeathers, or the Grass beneath, Where o'er the Glowworm's Lamp it wove its Fairywreath! 54 The Dewdrops, sparkling, on the Branches hung, Or fell scarcemarked, shook by the passing Wing Of nestreturning Bird: the Squirrel clung To the Beechboughs, most joyoushearted Thing, Blithe Tumbler! for his own Sport wantoning, Careless what Eye looked on him, while below, Along the Ground, would run a Twittering Of some E arthdweller, overhappy to Consign his Heart to Sleep ere Joy had had full Flow! 55 Oh blessed Calm of Nature, could we tune The passionjarrÃ«d Strings of Life by thee! If we were made Partakers of that Boon Of Blessedness and Peace, which all we see, By sweet Compulsion led insensibly, Inherits at thy Hands! the Bird his Song Carols at Will, the Squirrel in his Glee Neither with Surfeit nor Defect doth wrong Thy wise Indulgence, and his Life thro' Joy is long! 56 All Things that breathe, in their own silent Wise, Approve their Maker's Goodness, all but we, We Men, who dare to scan his Mysteries, To doubt and question, when we'd better be, Like the blithe Bird, from Selfannoyance free, Enjoying his good Gifts; when Reason wakes As Children we no longer feel and see Life's Blessedness, by us his stand he takes, And disenchants, and where he finds no Evil makes! 57 These three were gathered, striving to beguile Themselves of their own Thoughts, in that poor Cot Which was their Dwelling, Silence a brief While Followed the Biblereading, which had not Soothed to Forgetfulness of their sad Lot These sorrowstricken Hearts: hopesick were they, For when the Body's tied to one dull Spot, And goes its Tetherslength from Day to Day, At Times the Soul will flag, and suffer with its Clay! 58 But she, the Daughter, knew nor Doubt nor Fear, Hope smiling beckoned ever at her Side, And tho' the Autumnwinds came, whistling sere, To disenchant the Woods, and strip their Pride Of gold and purple Leafage, strewing wide, Like Winter's chill Forerunners, Earth's green Breast With all her withered Offspring, yet she eyed The saddened Scene with joyous Fancies blest, For in the Brightness of a coming Bliss 'twas drest! 59 And as they sorrowsilent sat, she said, Wishing to change the Channel of their Thought, Open the Bible, Mother dear, and read The Line I mention: so her Mother sought, For Hope and Fancy take Delight in aught That brings the Future more within the Sphere Of bright Conjecture: and from Omens wrought By seeming Chance our Guardianspirit here Draws sweet Convictions, and we feel the Presence near 60 Of Powers ever watchful unto Good, E'en in the merest Chance, the commonest Thing, Which Minds by Scepticdoubts disabled would Not comprehend, no Faith interpreting The else dead Forms, in which, e'en as a Spring Deepbosomed in the Rock, unknown, unsought, The high Truth lies, 'till heavenly Ministring, Enlarging our Capacity, have wrought So that, by Tokens meaningless to others taught, 61 The Soul, where all seemed dark and blank, has bright Glimpses and Openings up, and groping tries By these to feel its Way towards the Light! Upliftings of the aweful Veil that lies Over the Life of Things, the Mysteries Of the Soul's Bourne, whence ever and anon Some Recognition to our fond Enquiries Is echolike sent back, as half were won Of Death's great Secret e'en ere yet the Race be run! 62 Faith has her Pisgahs, whence we catch afar Clear Glimpses of a Life not realized, But where, in Spirit, we already are, For the Soul in these Bounds is not comprized; Tho' the Grave be a Barrier devised To mark its seeming Limits, yet it has High Priviledge, and, as it sympathized Still with its Source, mysteriously doth pass From these Fleshshackles to the Life that is, and was, 63 And ever will be: e'en as from the String The Music starts away, and then anon Is there again, true to its Ministering, Still hovering with airy Presence on The palpable Instrument, which is alone Its earthly Tenement, when from the Spheres Its Spirit, to the Poet's Fingering won, Springs 'neath his glowing Touch to charm Men's Ears And Hearts unto his own immortal Hopes and Fears! 64 And now the Bible's blessed Page displayed The following Words, with Characters of Light As in Faith's own Handwriting there arrayed, As tho' an Angel's Finger to her Sight Had pointed out the Passage, so, so bright- Impressed with divine Love, and bade her by A firm Belief interpret them aright, Â«God's Angel called to Agar from the Sky, And said, what dost thou there, fearnot,Â» thy Lord is nighÂ». 65 Thereat o'erjoyed the Maiden kissed the Book With her whole Soul upon her Lips, for she Felt at those Words as if empowered to look Into the Future's Womb, and there to see Th' Event not yet conceived, mysteriously Revealed beforehand; yea! for God makes known At Times his Presence unto those whom He Has not found wanting, by a Sign will own Their Faith, and send his Star to lead them duly on! 66 What matters it tho' to the outward Eye No seraphwinged and radiant Form appear, Firetongued to speak the Will of the Mosthigh? These are but palpable Means, and needless where A high Conviction gives the Mind a clear And perfect Vision for God's Mysteries; The virtuous Soul is ever in and near The Presence of its Maker, here still plies Its former Tasks, and communes with its native Skies! 67 By our own Thoughts he works his Miracles The best, informs the Mind with inward Light, And gives that Faith which its own End foretells And realizes! school then these aright, Think always upon God, then will His Might Guard thee, yea! Himself in that Thought draws nigh, Still at our Side He is, tho' palpable Sight Behold Him not: the Light within our Eye, The Soul itself whene'er it thinks aught grand or high!- 68 But soon her Father's Voice from this sweet Dream Recalled her, and he spake in Irony, As one of little Faith, Â«do ye then deem That God will send an Angel from the Sky To give ye Food and Raiment, or reply, Like to a Fortuneteller's juggling Tongue, To all that Man's vain Curiosity May prompt him to demand?Â» but he was wrong, For when with Faith we ask, the Lord delays not long. 69 And at his Bidding all Things find a Voice, Even the very Stones: it is the Ear, The Sense, earthdull'd, that (when we should rejoice At the bright Visitations scattered here, Like Sunbeams, allaround, with Radiance clear From Heaven falling upon commonest Things) Will not perceive: the Heart Doubt renders sere And dead to all celestial Visitings, Still should we distrust tho' an Angel's sunbright Wings 70 Flashed o'er our Brows, for all is from within, And outwardly can come no Proof, no high And calm Conviction: from ourselves we win The Power to read the Language of the Sky, Th' Eternal to the Eternal must reply: But he who questions Sense on divine Things, Heaven's Oracles to him are as a Lie; For still to Earth his downward Spirit clings, And recognizes that alone which from Earth springs! 71 All this knew Prascovy, and therefore she Replied, Â«I have no Hope, my Father dear, That God will send his Angel down to me, Yet have I firm Belief that everywhere My Guardianspirit will be by to cheer Me in my Hour of Need, and that tho' I Myself opposed this Impulse, Heaven's clear. And inward Prompting, 'twould be uselessly, For with a mightier Bidding I do but comply! 72 And she was right, for be assured if to Ourselves we be but true, that Heaven ne'er Will fail us, yea! to be so is our true- Est, surest Guardianangel, ever near, There where he most should be, in that one Sphere Where he can most effectually aid And counsel us, in our own Hearts! 'tis here The Angel must be sought, and we have made Him for ourselves if we his Voice have but obeyed! 73 Yea, she was right: for in our Hour of Need If God send not his Angel visibly With Heavenmanna the forlorn to feed, Yet He himself still as we call is nigh, Working his Wonders so, so secretly With weekday Instruments, which Fools despise As being too familiar to the Eye! For what were God if He could not devise Fit Means, without disturbing Nature's Harmonies? 74 If everytime he would work out some Aim He were compelled to use strange Agencies, To stop the Course of Things, disjoint the Frame Of firmfixed Custon, and affright the Eyes Of old Experience by Juggleries Of Sense, Interpositions palpable, And vain display of vulgar Ministries? These are but Proofs of Impotence, as well As Want of Wisdom: when He works a Miracle 75 'Tis not by disjoint Change, or palebrowed Fear, Or the eyedazzling Lightning, that he makes His Purpose known, his Will obeyÃ«d here! 'Neath Life's habitual Forms his Power wakes The Elements it works by, yet ne'er breaks Asunder the least Link in Nature's Chain Of daily Operations, Wisdom takes Things as they are, the Forms unchanged remain, But a new Spirit works within, nor works in vain! 76 There is a gentle Strength, whose Symbol may Be oft a Child's weak Voice, a Woman's Prayer, A whispered Word, which yet none dare gainsay, For 'tis of God himself, and ever where This Strength is felt, it conquers, God is there, And the Soul bows before its Maker, whose High Presence fills it like a Breath of Air! Such Strength was Prascovy's, and few could chuse But feel its Sway, when hallowed to such holy Use. 77 Another Month had flown, yet still her Heart Beat with its unaccomplished Wish, in vain She hoped that Time, with his own silent Art, Would smooth the Way: deceived, she hoped again, For Hope in her was Faith, naught could restrain Or check its Growth: yet of her Father she At Times unto herself would half complain For thwarting thus the high Divinity Which oracled her Breast, and Thought soon stole the Glee 78 From her young Voice, and threw a Cloud of Care O'er her onceopen Brow, and oft away She would steal from her Home, to wander where The Branches, with the Autumnwinds at Play, Made sadden'd Music, in that Wood where lay Her summerfavored Haunt: to her young Thought Made holy by sweet Fancies since that Day, When Faith's first Miracle for her was wrought, And to her inward Ear an answering Voice was brought. 79 There would she listen, while the sightless Wind Whistled in fitful Snatches thro' the Trees, With other Meanings far than those which find Fit Utterance in the flowerscented Breeze From Summer's ripe Lip blown; there would she teaze Her Heart with Fretting, while, before her Feet, Time counted with sere Leaves the Year's Decrease, Warning her how all earthly Pleasures fleet, Like the Spring's withered Glories, once so fresh and sweet! 80 Prime Moralizer! pointing still a Tale Of quiet Wisdom for a sober Eye With any casual Object, trite and stale, That Fools with heedless Step and Glance pass by: Employing Nature's sublime Imagery To teach the Lesson ever on his Tongue, Stamping the fallen Leaf with Meanings high, And mingling his deep Warnings with the Song Of Winds, and with all Things that to the Year belong! 81 He bids the Flowers spring up on the Grave, The careless Moss o'er Earth's proud Names, for so, In his own quiet Way, he loves to have A harmless Triomph, teaching Fools to know The Difference He makes 'twixt high and low! He loves a Jest, and practical ones too, And where the Monarch's Palace stood bids grow The Dayseye, that Mankind may learn the True And During, which resume their Placeas they should do! 82 Truth is his Fosterchild: neglected by The World, since from her starry Home she came To bless this thankless Earth, with Contumely Oft treated, oft unrecognized, to Shame Abandoned, oft robbed of her very Name, 'Till Time, her firmest Friend, secures her high, Calm Triumphs, touching with her living Flame, One after one, Men's Hearts, until thereby They Glow with divine Warmth, and clearer secs the Eye! 83 Here communed she with Nature, 'till the Soul And Spirit of the Universe into Her Heart had sent that Impulse which the Whole Imparts to all with it in Union true; 'Till every Thought and Fancy that she knew Was but an Echo of that holy Lore, That Poetry, which, by Degrees, will hue The Hearts of all who're fitted to adore And feel God present in his Love in Earth's least Flower! 84 For 'twixt the outward World and our own Hearts There is a secret Intercourse, whereby, Like Echo to the Voice, the one imparts A Consciousness of answered Sympathy Unto the other; all that Ear and Eye Can furnish us, are Symbols of our Thought, 'Tis one same Truth conveying diversely Its high Convictions, and the Earth has naught But to a Type of inward Feeling may be wrought. 85 Here, in deep Selfforgetfulness, would she Oft tarry, 'till the thickening Shadows made A pleasant Twilight for the Bat, here, free From all Intrusion, oft the first Star bade Her think with Selfreproach how much afraid At her long Absence must her Mother be, Her Fears still growing as the Sunbeams play'd Feebler along the Leaves of some far Tree, Or on the Cottagedoor, 'till she no more could see! 86 Then would she hurry homeward, counting by Her beating Heart each Step, the while she thought Upon the Hours of quickpulsed Agony, Which to her Mother's Bosom she thus brought By her Unkindness; then, with her untaught And simple Eloquence, she'd win their Ears To her Request, and beg, if they felt aught Of Love for her, or Pity for her Tears, That they would let her go, nor listen to their Fears. 87 And once, when more than was her Wont she stay'd, Her Mother thought that she was really gone, Like nestflown Bird, for aye, and all dismay'd Embracing her, with Eyes where faint Smiles shone Thro' gushing Teardrops, with reproachful Tone, Â«We feared that you were gone, my Child,Â» she said, Â«Gone, gone, and we were left to mourn alone, Life were but as a Flower whence has fled All Perfume and all Bloom, soon waste and witherÃ«dlÂ» 88 To which her Daughter, with sad Voice, replied, A Tone so melancholy, deep, and low, Like that of one who can no longer hide The whole Amount of some longcherished Woe, Which allunconsciously itself must show In each least Word and Look, so deep the Well From whence it springs to Life, so far below The Surface its full Source, Â«alas! too well My Mother knows what she would force my Lips to tell!Â» 89 If you do fear to lose me, you will know That Pain too soon, for I can no more stay, And with or without Passport must I go, For 'tis a divine Finger points the Way; And if you should refuse, oh then some Day You will repent thereof, when I am far, Far, far away from you: yet whate'er may Betide, it is as vain with God to war, As think with idle Prayers to stay yon' sphereborns Star! 90 By these sad Words her Mother was so moved She sought by soothing Speech to tranquillize Her agitated Daughter, whom she loved The dearer for Life's many Miseries, Which had but rivetted more closely Ties Prosperity's warm Sun oft melts intwain, As tho' they were as cold and frail as Ice! She promised her Consent, if she could gain Her Father's Approbation, or from him obtain 91 The Passport, without which she could not go; For there, where she was born, Man is not free To move as he may please, like Winds that blow Unshackled where they list, there Tyranny Is hundredhanded, Arguseyed to see, Its Spidermeshes far and wide are thrown In all Directions; soulless Slavery Has there no Voice to make his Insults known, And Life's brute Breath is all that Man dares call his own! 92 At length the sweetest Word that mortal Ear Had ever listened to her Father spake; One Morming in the Garden she drew near Him and embraced his Knees, thereby to make Her Prayer more moving, and his Heart to shake With that sweet Language of the Face and Eyes, More eloquent than Words, Looks which can take Prisoner the Soul, its inmost Sympathies Reach with electric Shock, when in vain Echos dies 93 The lagging Speech upon the unmoved Ear. She prayed him to believe she was urged on By divine Impulse, begged that he would hear God's Voice appealing to him in her own: Besought him not to thwart this only one, This only Prayer that she had ever made, Nor force her by, what he had never shown, Undue Severity, to trust for Aid In God, and Pardon for thus having disobeyed 94 A Father's Wishes, most unwillingly, Because her Love could chuse no other Way; To these her Supplications, aided by A half Conviction of some heavenly Sway Making its Presence felt, some latent Ray Of unextinguished Hope, and his Wife's Tears, The Father could no longer say her nay. Then as when suddenly the swift Wind clears A Space of azure Blue, and smiling forth appears 95 The mistdispelling Sun, so was the Face Of Prascovy, when with her joyous Ear She drank those Words, to her so full of Grace And all sweet Meanings; then around her dear And halfrepentant Father, with the Tear Which Sorrow lent to Joy still in her Eye, By one Thought's magic Light transformed, she, ere He could find Words, her Arms flung lovingly, An unrestrained poured forth her Heartin Utterance high: 96 Coined into sweet Caresses, Looks of Love, And rapturebreathing Words; Â«oh Father dear,Â» Thus spake she, do you think that He above, Who thus has touched thy Heart, and bade thee hear Thy Daughter's Prayer, cannot incline the Ear And Heart likewise of him to whom I go, Our Emperor, tho' not one Friend be near To aid my Voice, from his own Heart he'll know I come not of myself, that Kings themselves must bow 97 To Him whom I obey;Â» thus spoke the Maid, Already in the Future; naught knew she Of all the Circumstance and vain Parade, Eyedazzling Pomp, and hollow Pageantry, That hem in Power, lest it seem to be That which it is, all Nothingness and Show; For having in itself no Majesty Of native Worth, to which the Soul can bow, It wraps itself in Silk and Ermine, decks its Brow 98 With that same gilded Bauble called a Crown, And hides its Vices from the vulgar Eye In outward Splendor: she saw not the Frown Of liveried Office, ready to deny The Sufferer's Prayer ere asked, the Mockery Of multitudinous Forms that hedge a Throne, Thorny and hard to pass, the Guards that by The Palacegate keep Watch: she saw alone The Emperor, and grasped the Prize she deem 'd her own! 99 These Obstacles her Father, who well knew The World and its dark Ways, to her young Thought Painted in Hues to sad Experience true; He knew that JustÃ¬ce by the Ounce is bought, As any other Merchandise, that naught Is such a Luxury, or costs so dear, Had learnt that Truth far less than Gold is sought, That Innocence from Guile has all to fear, And that few Pilots know on Life's dark Tide to steer! 100 But she replied, Â«that Providence, which reads The Hearts of Men, will aid me even there, Place on my Lip the moving Words it needs, And keep my Steps from falling in the Snare, Breathe into other Minds the Hopes I bear In mine own Heart: a Father's Liberty The Lord will Grant unto a Daughter's Prayer!Â» Seeing her thus resolved, reluctantly He fixed the Day, and left the Issue to the Sky. FOURTH PART. 1 Spirit of olden Times! that on the Brow Of Saint and Prophet with thy starry Wings Of Glory wouldst descend, be with me now, Uphold and cherish, and from earthly Things Free thou my Thoughts, with heavenly Ministrings Create in me the Temper which I need, Give me that Faith which ever with it brings A Boon of Glory when 'tis felt indeed, Wisdom unto the Heart, and Eloquence to feed 2 The Lips with all high Utterance, that I, Tho' undeserving of such special Grace, May, with the Breath of Inspiration high, Scatter the Clouds that hide thy radiant Face, And give clear Glimpses of his Dwellingplace To Man's earthdarkened Soul: bright Paths of Light E'en to God's Throne, to which his Eye may trace The Radiance oft bursting on his Sight 'Mid Mists of Earthliness, whose Majesty and Might 3 He bows before unconsciously, yet knows Not well from whence it comes, 'till he be taught To recognize the Fount from which it flows In his own Soul: for from one Source is brought The Spirit with which his own Breast is fraught, And that same Majesty to which he bows, A kindred Essence, differing in naught, Save as its Mode of Operation shows Forth more or less His Praise to whom all Worth it owes! 4 Spirit that bor'st Elijah up to Heaven, In Firecar whose Path burned thro' the Skies, By whom to Sampson's Victorarm was given The Might of Hosts to smite God's Enemies: Who in a later Day unto the Eyes Of Socrates reveal' dst thy radiant Form, And gave to Milton's Pen high Victories, Oh with thy Presence deign thou to inform My Heart, and with Faith's purest Altarfire warm! 5 Glory to thee, bright Spirit! onceagain I Sing thy Triomphs of a later Day, Divine as in past Ages! not in vain We call on thee, and 'mid our Sufferings pray For inward Light to cheer us on our Way, Still canst thou work thy Miracles as in The olden Time, not palpable it may Be, yet most clear to Eyes undimmed by Sin, And still thy low, calm Voice we hear 'mid Earth's harsh Din! 6 Glory and Gratitude! for still bright Gleams Of Light celestial across our Eyes, Our dim Eyes, pass, when all around us seems Wrapp'd in the Mists of Earthliness: in Skies Lowering and sad bright Openings-up arise, Some Angelswings divide the dark Midspace, And Glimpses of pure Ether, as he flies Down from God's Throne, we view, the Realms of Grace, And turn contented back to this brief Sojournplace! 7 The Partingday was fixed: who does not know Those Moments, doubly dear, that intervene, On which we lavish our whole Hearts, as tho' Our All was summed in them: her Father mean- While sought the few who seemed, or there had been, His Friends and Fellowexiles, asked for Aid, But these Lipfriends, as is their Wont, I ween, Gave readytongued Advice, Excuses made, And, when their Curiosity was quite allayed, 8 Took Leave, muchgrieved, no Doubt, that they could do So dear a Friend no Service in his Need, At any other Time they would have so, So much Delight to help him, but indeed Just now they could give naught! such Fruit the Seed Of daily Intercourse brings forth in those Who wear the Yoke of Mammon, in whom Greed Is the foul Source whence every Action flows, Selfpunished, for the sordid Heart no real Bliss knows! 9 Men who would not stretch forth their Hand to save A starving Fellowcreature, or deny To their own Mouths one Drop of all they have, One smallest, most superfluous Luxury, To moisten the parched Lip of Misery! Two Friends alone he found, who with them brought Not empty Words, but heartfelt Sympathy, Pursepoor, loverich, and tho' possessing naught, Yet willing to give all they had, unasked, unsought! 10 They brought the precious Balm of Sympathy Unto the wounded Heart, they gave away What all the Gold of Misers cannot buy One Grain of: Wealth does hold a mighty Sway O'er earthly Goods, but there are some Things, yea! Some Things there are, of which ye wot not, ye Who revel in proud Pomp and vain Display, That all the Gold that ever Eye might see Can purchase not, yet unto which the Beggar's free 11 As is the proudest Monarch, and of which, By Right divine, he claims as large a Share! They are his Heritage! in these still rich, Tho' scarce a Rag his naked Back may bear! Love, Wisdom, Truth, Religion, Faith, these are Still free as Light to all Men, yea! I say, So long as this glad Sun shall shine, this Air Be breathed by Rich and Poor, these things for aye Shall be the Soul's high Dower, and own no earthlier Sway! 12 Then fill your Coffers to the Brim, ye who Bow down to Mammon as your Idol here, Be your Prayers heard, and let him heap on you The yellow Dust ye covet, but no Tear Of Love or Sympathy, quickstarting clear, Like a sweet Messenger of holy News, Shall tell that ye have Hearts, no Joy or Fear For others' Good shall change the cold Cheek's Hues, Nor from your Hoards shall ye e'er draw one genial Use! 13 Then grovel in the Dust, and take your Fill Of earthly Goods, celestial Things to ye Are Pearl to Swine: I wish ye no more Ill Than in Truth's Glass to know yourselves, and see The perfect Shape of your Deformity! For who could envy you, that in his Breast Feels an Heart beat? still proud to think that he, Tho' to him e'en the Crumbs would be a Feast Which from your Table fall, is not like ye at least! 41 Ye cannot rob us of our Heritage, Your desecrating Touch ye cannot place On our Soul's Treasure: God for us doth wage A holy Warfare, and with Love and Grace Sweetens the Toils of this our earthly Race: The Goal decides the Winner; let Earth be Unto the Rich and Strong, let Power's Face Frown at Truth's fearless Voice, still are we free, And Lords of all the Earth can yield far more than ye! 15 What tho' ye be her Favorites! what tho', Spoilt Children, in her Lap she pampers ye, 'Till every Pleasure to a Surfeit grow! 'Till, in the very 'midst of Luxury, Ye envy each poor Toiler that ye see, Who in the daily Sweat of his own Brow Eats his coarse, scanty Bread! think ye that we, Nature's uncared for Children, never know One Joy, because your Eyes and Hearts are dull and slow? 16 Poor Fools! the Lark sings for the Peasant's Ear As to the King's, the Mountains and the Streams, The Woods and Waters, unto all are dear! The Clouds build up their Palaces, with Beams And purple Hues of Evening, bright as Dreams, Not for the sated Eye of Wealth alone, But for the Poet, who in Rapture deems That to this dull Existence may be won The glorious Colors of a Life not yet begun! 17 Aye! and pure Feelings, Aspirations high, And Fellowcreaturelove, and starry Lore, May oft be found 'mid Rags and Poverty! There where Fools least expect to find the Power And Majesty of Worth, it loves the more, In modest Privacy, to hide its Head, For it gives forth its Sweetness like the Flower, That allunseen by heavenly Dews is fed, Looking not for Reward, by this repaid instead! 18 And such were these two Friends: tho' poorer far Than all the rest, and Beggars but in Will, Tho' small of this Life's Goods their hardearn'd Share, Wrung from the niggard Grasp of Want, who, still Their stern Taskmaster, hardened them to Ill And Suffering, yet left their Hearts at least Unchilled and kind, and ready to fulfill Each holy Prompting, and each high Behest, Of that pure Soul of Love still reigning o'er their Breast. 19 'Twas a Septembermorn: the Month was now But eightdaysold, yet waxing strong apace, Like to a lusty Child in Youth's first Glow, And these two Friends had come to see the Face Of her they loved, to take Farewell, and place The scanty Sum that bought their daily Food, (A few poor Pence, yet still a Gift to grace A King) at her Disposal; but she would Not take it, no, tho' sore in Need herself she stood! 20 Reader, the Godlike enters into this Coarse weekday Life â Â«a few poor PenceÂ», to thee Sounds ill no Doubt, but unto me it is Full, full of Poesy, and just thro' the So seeming Vileness of the Means we see Employ'd! the Godlike, of which those poor Pence Are but the Bearers, hallows them to me: Is perfect Love not perfect Recompense? Then with them God himself might be payedin this Sense! 21 The Dawn, the bright Dawn, glows in the far East, And the Sunsteeds are flashing forth the Day From their lightbearing Orbs: with ample Chest, And firemanÃ«d Necks, curved haughtily, They blow the Darkness from Earth's Face away, With prouddistended Nostrils! and e'en now Upon that parting Group hath stole a Ray, Celestial Messenger! the Hour to show, Sent by her God himself to bid the Wanderer go! 22 The Time is come, she said, and we must part; So saying, she sat down a while, and stay'd 'Till she had checked the Beatings of her Heart, Then thanked she those good Friends for their kind Aid, And promised that if Heaven should persuade The Emperor to set at Liberty Her Father, she would think of them: this said, As if to cheat the Sense of Misery, And steala Moment's Joy from Time's Wings as they fly, 23 They talked of casual Subjects, a brief Space, The Weather, with forced Carelessness, as tho' Each could not read the Secret in each Face, The illfeigned Calm, the hollow Mask of Woe, That makes the Lip to quiver, pale to grow The Cheek, which strives to look itself in vain, For Nature, tho' subdued awhile, will show In some poor twitching Nerve the inward Pain, The Stoic's Mask must drop, and Men grow Men again! 24 But such the Russian Usage: wise, 'tmight be, If we could conquer Nature; but, alas! The big Tear, and the beating Heartpulse we Cannot command! it is an idle Farce, A vain Attempt, Pride's Effort to o'erpass The Frailty of our mortal State, to seem That which he is not; each big Moment has A double Weight, with twofold Grief doth teem, A stern Reality within a painful Dream!â 25 Imagination! paint thou what my vain And feeble Words are allunequal to; Reader, let thy Heart speak, live o'er again The bitter Time, if such be known to you, When first, from thy dear Home, from kind, and true, And loving Hearts, at stern Necessity's Inexorable Call, removed, on new, Strange, loveless Faces thou didst turn thine Eyes, And the World's harsh Voice chill'd the Soul's warm Sympathies! 26 Still will the Heart beat quick, still to the Eye In Afterlife th' unbidden Tear will rise, When on those Moments of deep Agony, Thro' the dim Veil which Time, still as he flies. Throws o'er the Past, we look! then sympathize With what this godlike Spirit felt, the Throes By Duty claimed, a stern, high Sacrifice, Yea! more than to her Altar Virtue owes, When friendless, pennyless, her noble Part she chose! 27 Behold her kneeling at her Father's Feet For his last Blessing! and if ever on A mortal Head a Blessing fell, with sweet And benign Influence, oh! then upon Her Virginbrow there surely hovered one, Brought by some viewless Angel from the Sky! We ourselves make the Blessing, we alone! It falls upon the Ear, a Sound passed by, Or by Belief becomes a living Agency! 28 The last Embrace is o'er, that Heart to Heart, And Lip to Lip, had bound them: the big Tear Still trickles down unchecked, yet must they part, Unknowing when again they may meet here, On this cold, selfish Earth, so dull and drear! Which thrusts its icy Hand in Mockery 'Twixt Heart and Heart, and with its Breath so sere Breathes on our young Affections, and they die, Withered up in the Bud, ere yet Hope's Dew be dry! 29 And she is gone, nor turns back once her Head To look at her dear Parents, fixed, like Stone, Upon the Threshold, waiting, while she sped In Distance from their Sight, to give her one, One more Farewell, one Handwave, or one Tone Of the unconscious Voice, that murmurs still A vain Adieu! alas! their Child is gone, She dares not trust herself to look if still They watch her, lest her Heart should rise against her Will! 30 And there they stood, with straining Glance, until Their Daughter's Form, receding from their Eyes, In the far Distance disappeared: yet still They gazed and gazed, as tho' the Boundaries Of Space retired, and they saw arise Object on Object to the Journeysend; Then waked they from their Dream, with Tears and Sighs Turning to their sad Chamber, there to spend The childless, desolate Hours, 'till Heaven Relief should send. 31 No more that sweet Voice broke upon their Ear With the glad Music of its harmless Glee, Blithe as the Lark's, no more, like Sunbeam clear, The Loveglance from her young Eye did they see; Nature's Interpreter to them was she, The Voice of all its Joys, from her the Light That brightened all Things came, and there could be No Joy when they saw not with her glad Sight, For Grief on their own Senses had diffused a Blight! 32 And now those falselipped Friends accused him sore Of having urged his Child to go: they made A Laughingstock of him, and sneered the more Because they had refused him every Aid! As if, forsooth, from Love to him they stay'd The ready Hand, lest of a foolish Thing He should repent, or to their Charge be laid The Blame of Illsuccess! thus did they bring Upon the griefbowed Head Shame's heavier Visiting. 33 But let us leave them to his Mercy, who Hath Cosolation for the broken Heart, When human Aid is vain, and turn to view The Wanderer whom we have seen depart, With whom we shared the bitter Pang, the Smart Of that Homeseparation; let us deem That we behold her, half in Terror, start To find how strange all Things around her seem, On waking the next Morn, how like a painful Dream 34 To be thus allalone: to feel no more The loving Handgrasp, that electrical Communicates its Message sweet, before The Words have from the dear Lips Time to fall: To want henceforth, and feel the Worth of, all Those little, daily kindnesses, which are Poured in Life's Cup like Honeydrops, which small As they may seem, viewed singly, sweeten far, Far more than prouder Joys, that dazzle with vain Glare! 35 Come now, Imagination, thou wouldst spread Haply thy Wings, and soar up to the Sky, But this once with me in the Footsteps tread Of poor and suffering Humanity: Yet are they holy, yea! as tho' they by An Angel walking on this common Earth, For the Fulfillment of some Mission high, Had been imprinted! thou art nothing worth, Savethou canst make this Scene bright as thy Place of Birth! 36 Fold then thy Wings, thy rainbowplumÃ«d Wings, For in an Angel's Steps thou walkest now: Think not thou lowerest thyself, tho' Things Of earthly Import seem to thee but low, For in Reality they are not so! Tho' boundless be thy Ether, and thus dear To thee, yet haply 'tmay be found below, Yea! e'en four narrow Walls embrace that Sphere, To which thou lov'st to soar, as vast, as bright, and clear! 37 I talk no Riddles, tho' of Miracles! Yet Miracles which everyday are wrought: Familiar, as Householdwords, the Spells By which we work them, yea! the Spells are taught Not in dark Forms such as Medea sought To sway the Stars with, but in Language clear, The clearest Nature speaks! in Actions fraught With human Feeling, and the Voice of dear, Domestic Love, still sounding sweetest in God's Ear! 38 A little Child, that on his Mother's Breast Lisps forth his Prayer, and smiles up in her Face, Ere softly she hath laid him down to Rest, Who, tho' unconscious of all Sin, for Grace Prays unto God, yet pure, and without Trace Of human Frailty, can work Wonders too: Can call down Angels to his Dwellingplace, To watch o'er it, and is the Medium thro' Which Love eternal works to quicken us anew! 39 Then come with me, yet, ever and anon, Thou shalt have free Use of thy restless Wings, To soar wheree'er thou list'st, to gaze upon The Archangel's Face, when by God's Throne he sings, To tune thy Harp to his, and fit its Strings For holiest Themes! and when thou comest back Refreshed with thy ethereal Wanderings, To aid and to support, oh! be not slack, Speak with my Voice, nor let thine Inspiration lack! 40 Away vain Forms of glozing Poesy! Upon no fabled Muse I call for Aid, But on thee, Father, nor wilt thou deny My Prayer, for thine own Spirit still has made Itself felt in me, it alone has prayed! And tho' it be by these frail Lips of Clay, Yet in thy boundless Mercy thou hast bade Us call thee Â«Father,Â» raise thou then my Lay Into a Hymn of Praise: hear! 'tis thy Child doth pray! 41 Come then, Imagination, we will pass Lightly the Ground her slow Feet measured o'er, With easy Wing shalt thou observe what was To her a weary Way and Travail sore: Yet must thou pause, and wonder how she bore Such sharp Discomfort without e'en a Sigh, And, to a noble Mind, that Wound far more Hard to be borne, the Insult, and the Eye Of Scorn, the threatening Lip, the grudged Humanity! 42 But God is merciful, He tempers to Our Bearing what were else so hard to bear, To the shorn Lamb the Wind! and the Soul too Doth something of His Infiniteness share: Things are but as we view them, foul or fair, Aids or Impediments: in all Things lies A genuine Treasure for those who know where And how to seek it, and from worst Things rise Their Contraries, as Joy brings Tears into the Eyes! 43 How hard th' Apprenticeship of th' human Heart, The Entrance into actual Life, for one Who only in her Dreams has taken Part Therein: brought up in Love's own School, with none But Laws which to obey is Heaven, for Is Heaven not Love? yea! Love is the true Law- Enforcer and Lawgiver, he alone, And light as Gossamer his Chains are thrown Around us, yet so strong no Jailor ever saw! 44 'Tis hard to school the Heart, and teach the Tongue Another Utterance than that which by The Feelings, gushing fresh, unchecked, and strong, Is prompted! yet this Lesson Prascovy Must learn, soon taught that human Sympathy Is slow towards that which first would claim Esteem; In Pity is Superiority Implied, and all Men willingly would deem That those who ask their Aid are 'neath them as they seem. 45 How often must she turn in Tears away From the shut Door, and season bitter Bread With that still bitterer Salt! oft make Assay Of Humannature in its variÃ«d Conditions, now from Luxury half dead To Pity, which in poorest Soils most grows, Now by the Hand of Fellowsuffering fed, For such is Humannature: our own Woes The true Extent of others' Sufferings disclose! 46 How godlike is that Mind which e'en in Ill Sees only Good, and makes the Evil so By bearing it as none! which Suffering still Ennobles but the more, not renders low, Stamping the God more clearly on the Brow! Which in its Fellowcreatures sees alone, With Thankfulness the Godlike only know, The little Acts of Kindness to it done, Forgetting all the Ill, which thus forgot is none! 47 Then learn by Littles and by Littles to Forget and to forgive the Injuries And Insults which thy Fellowmen may do Unto thee! view them as the Stone which lies By mere Chance in thy Way, and which, if wise, Thou kick'st not, not to stumble! do but so, 'Till thou on Earth hast no more Enemies, Till none can injure thee! 'till e'en the Blow, Forgiven, wounds not thee, but works the Smiter Woe! 48 This is the godlike Lore, the Lore of Life, The Lore of Love, which, seeing Good alone, Lives as if nothing Evil could arrive, And Good were only! 'till all Things have grown To Good or Good, partaking of its own Inherent Goodness! proud Philosophy, Is this Art in thy Schools so little known, While a poor Girl, with but a loving Eye, Can see beyond thee, yea! for Love's Infinity! 49 The Eye of God Himself! and he who sees Without Love, nothing sees, but is as blind, Tho' he can trace the Planets' Course with Ease, And analyze the Motions of the Mind! While he who sees with Love, will all Things find Godlike, for sees he not with God's own Eye? Then even on the lowest of Mankind Look thou with Love, then will he seem as high As Monarchs on their Thrones, for God in Him is nigh! 50 The Shades of Night are gathering, the Forms Of Things grow indistinct, the Owlet gray, And Bat flit 'round her, and her Fancy warms At Thought of that dear Home so far away, The Kiss of Wellcome at the Close of Day, Pressed by a Mother's Lips, the Fireside So homesome, but she starts, for lo! a Ray Breaks from yon' Cottagewindow, and the wide, Wide Distance 'twixt that Home, by Fancy halfdescried. 51 Comes chilling on her Soul! 'tis not the Door From loug Familiarity grown dear, The Threshhold pressed by Feet now heard no more! It is a Stranger's Dwelling, and, in Fear Of Insult or Refusal, she draws near And knocks â it opens â and with trembling Tongue She begs for Shelter: 'tis denied or e'er Her Prayer is uttered, Insult joined to Wrong, And spoken by a Voice harsh as the Raven's Song. 52 Oh! ye in Plenty cradled, and fed by The Bread which in your Mouths drops as a Thing Of Course, picked up like Manna from the Sky, Without one single Effort, can ye bring Home to yourselves the Sense of Suffering Felt then by one whose Heart was not as those Of Beggars, deadened by long Buffeting, Coarse Natures, hardened, like their Skins, to Blows Of Fortune, and touched only by the Body's Woes! 53 Oh if ye can, be merciful, break not The bruisÃ«d Reed, but bind it up â away She turns, but hark! a Voice from the same Spot Recalls her, the same Voice that said her nay; It was a Man with Hair already gray, Who offered her the Shelter just denied, And half loth, yet not daring to gainsay, She followed, like an Angel at the Side Of some dark Spirit, moved by Thoughts the Soul would hide 54 E'en from itself; a dim and dusky Light Halfbroke the Chambersgloom, which flickered on The bare Walls, cold and comfortless to Sight, As the hard Features of the aged Crone, Who, like a Witch, sat muttering all alone With fixÃ«d Eyes, of cold and glassy Stare, Bent on poor Prascovy, and with a Tone Fitted but Words of harsher Sense to bear, Sheasked her whence she came and what her Purpose were? 55 When answered, she rejoined, with ghastly Grin That showed her gummy Jaws, Â«then you must have Much Gold, so long a Journey to beginÂ»; In vain poor Prascovy said no, she gave But more Cause for Suspicion, and to save Herself would willingly have given all She had, or slept in some coldroofÃ«d Cave, Where Wolves and Foxes to each other call, And Dropstones slowly count the Minutes as they fall! 56 They bade her then go rest, and when they thought Her wellasleep, with eager Hands and Eyes, Long for her fancied Wealth they vainly sought, Then fearful Whispers heard she, and Replies, Â«None saw her enter, none will make SurmizeÂ»! Terror, with frayÃ«d Eyes, watched by her Bed Instead of Sleep! she saw the old Hag rise, And felt her loosen from her Neck, halfdead With Fear, the Bag where she her Passport carriÃ«d! 57 Then they gave o'er their Search, and fell asleep, And wearied Nature mastering her Fears, She felt the poppied Slumber o'er her creep Likewise: but who knows in her Dreams what Leers The old Hag's sleepsealed Eyes still cast, what Tears She shed, or what mysterious Warnings were By unseen Powers whispered in the Ears Of those two guilty Souls, what Visions rare, What vital Beatings of the Heart, thus touched to spare! 58 Perhaps they dreamt an Angel had that Night Crossed in Disguise their Threshhold, from the Sky Descended, hiding his celestial Might In a poor Mortal's Semblance, thus to try Their Hearts: and that without Humanity Received, he at his Parting sudden grew Into his primal Shape, with Language high Warned them of Punishment, if they should do The Purpose of their Hearts, and back to Heaven flew! 59 Thus these three lay asleep, the guilty and The guiltless, of eachother's Presence no More conscious than so far as Dreams demand Matter of Memory, or some sharp Throe Of Conscience sting the Sleeper â Dreams are so, So wonderful, and often they may be The Vehicles, tho' how we scarcely know, Of Revelations, changing that which we Had purposed, for change but a Thought, and we must see 60 Things in another Light; and tho' a Dream Be unreal as a Fact, it is not so Unto the Soul: enough if we but deem It real, and real Effects will from it flow, 'Tis then a Motive to us, because tho' A Dream, it still has close Analogy With all we think and feel, do, hope, or know, Past Elements are moulded in and by Our Sleep, and vital Gleams imparted from the Sky! 61 Thus slept she, like a Flower, folded sweet In its own Fragrance, tho' the Sun now shone High up in Heaven, 'till the Sound of Feet Awoke her, and the Hag, with softer Tone, Invited her to eat: her Breakfast done, She took her Leave, and to her great Surprize, On opening her Purse, found not alone The Coins she had, but more! thus in strange Wise Their Hearts were touched that Night to human Simpathies! 62 And truly too the Angel had that Night Crossed o'er their Threshhold, as their Dream had shown, And at departing in a Form more bright Appeared unto them; not that it had grown Unto another Stature, but their own Hearts being touched, their Vision was more clear Than when, from Want of Love, they saw alone An Outcast to be robbed: and to their Ear Her Farewellvoice was as the Angel's, yet no Fear 63 Its sweet Tones caused, but rather seemed to leave A Blessing on them for the Ill undone, And sounding as a Message of Reprieve From threatened Punishment! Oh! there are none To whom such Angels are not also shown From Time to Time; then drive them not away, But open wide your Doors, for tho' unknown Angels as Beggars now appear, some Day Beggars will Angels be, and able to repay 64 A hundredfold your Kindness! nay, e'en now They leave you richer than they found you! yea! For you give them but earthly Goods, and how Can spiritual Goods be better, pray, Bought than with perishable, which one Day May rob thee of? then open wide thy Door, But most of all thy Heart, that thus it may Receive in its Embrace the misnamed Poor, Who give more than they take, and make their Gifts more sure! 65 September now was tottering to his Grave, And Aguefits possessed him quite, for lo! Winter has smit him; bark! the Frostwinds rave In gusty Snatches, and thick falls the Snow, Burying Man's busy Track so deep that no Foottraveller dare venture on his Way; And Prascovy, tho' eager still to go, Must view the Snow heaped by the Winds at Play, And by their Flakes count out the dull Course of each Day! 66 But lo! the Snowdust is whirled up amain, And o'er the whitened Track comes gliding on, With Sound of Bell and Voice, a long Sledgetrain, Glad Sight for hopesick Eyes to look upon; A Place is straight procured from Hearts soon won To Pity, and she now resumes her Way: But bittercold it blew, and Sun was none, The Bear had Need of all his Fur that Day, And she of all her Patience, not the vain Display 67 Which some make of it in Life's fancied Ills, But the stern Virtue taught by actual Throes, Which in the Breast a godlike Calm instills, The Calm of that blessed Place to which it owes Its Origin, and which it brings to those Who feel it truly. Fancy, speed them on, Let Catharinestown its wished for Towers disclose, Touched faintly by a setting Wintersun, And briefly tell the Love her Piety there won; 68 Real Friendship in one who had Means to make Her Wishes Deeds, a Lady, and far more, A Christian, who did for Doing's Sake Alone all Acts of Kindness in her Power. She heard the Exile's Tale, and with her bore The Wanderess, instructed, sheltered, taught To read and write, and gave her of her Store: Not the mere sensual Goods which are as naught, But the refinÃ«d Feelings and the lofty Thought! 69 And yet, alas! it was a dangerous Gift For one whose Mission was like Prascovy's! The Feelings which refine, the Thoughts which lift, The keen Sense of Life's sweet Proprieties, Raised above Want and coarse Necessities, Whose galling Pressure leaves the Mind no Thought For nobler Things, tho' making us despise What is so low in itself, profit naught To better Bearing: nay, unfit our Minds when brought 70 To the stern Trial, and we shrink away, Not so much from the Suffering and Pain, As from the coarser Accidents, which lay The inmost Nerves bare, quivering again; And thus this precious Boon is rendered vain! Our Feelings are the Test of Suffering: Thus Ills at Sight of which some scarce contain Their Laughter may the Heart's deep Fibres wring, To which, longintertwined, our dearest Habits cling! 71 But that Increase of Suffering had made No Difference in her still unwearied Love, Tho' henceforth she felt oftentimes afraid To enter some poor Inn's low Door, does prove That it could only be from up above: Else had the Triomph not been so complete, That never one least Thought of Self could move The sublime Purpose, or the sacred Heat Diminish which within her Breast had ta'en its Seat! 72 Here learnt she from her Friends to read and write, To multiply her Being and to grow Many in One: the Wisdom and the Light Of Mankind, what they think, and feel, and know, Becomes the Heritage of one Mind, so All Form the one, and without all the one Advances little: thus all to all owe Their Weal reciprocally, and yet none But receives far more Good than he has ever done! 73 How much Cause have we then for Gratitude! How zealous should we toil to pay, as best We can, our Fellowcreatures for the Good Which we thro' them enjoy, as tho' one Breast Were that of all Mankind and had the Zest Of many thousand Lives! here learnt she too To pray in studied Phrase, as Men do, lest They should forget, unless reminded thro' Set Forms, that God exists, as they too often do! 74 How sweet it seemed to her so simple Mind The Feelings of her Heart, in ready Phrase, Thus in the Prayerbook all expressed to find: How happy they, she thought, who thus might praise Their Maker: but still Piety decays, Churches are not Religion, nor loud Prayers Real Worship! tho' the choral Voices raise The sounding Hymn, and Music breathe soft Airs, Yet God delights in other Melody than theirs! 75 Tho' Words be needful between Man and Man, They are not so 'twixt Man and God, for he The unuttered Thought within the Soul can scan: And if there such a Thing too really be As the Unutterable, how can we Express it? and he who has not felt this, Has not felt God, nor therefore fittingly Adored Him, for the highest Worship is The still Communion of our own Soul with His! 76 Come Fancy, turn the Hourglass, and let The Moments fly, as if they ne'er had brought A Sorrow, as if Heart had known no Fret, And Eye no Tear, meanwhile! now be there wrought A gentle Wonder, sudden as a Thought, And lo! 'tis done! green Leaves are on each Tree, And Flowers scent the Air, and Sounds are caught As of the Streams from icy Thrall set free! So sudden that it scarce could swifter be 77 Worked out by Fancy's self! a Threedaysspace Parts Spring and Winter: look! thick lies the Snow: Now close thine Eye, and fold thy Arms, and place Thee like some old Stonestatue, and wait so As for a Resurrection! meanwhile, lo! The Earth has changed, as sudden as the Dream Which passes thro' thy Mind: awake, and go Thou forth, and haply, wondering, thou 'lt deem Thyself in some new World, so strange the Change doth seem! 78 And now as from this second Home must she Depart: stern Duty's Voice alone she hears, And, bitter as the Sacrifice must be, There is a Rapture even in the Tears Shed at such Times, and Memory endears Beyond all Joy the Hour of Agony! For looking back at it, the Pangs and Fears Are gone, we see ourselves as 'twere thereby Transfigured, and past Pain grows present Ecstacy! 79 Behold her then take Leave of her kind Friends, Left once more to that Providence which wise- Ly in Life's weekday Forms works out its Ends, Subliming into divine Agencies Familiar Events: to Faith's clear Eyes The greatest Miracles are those worked by Such Means as Nature everyday supplies, And not those which disturb her Course, for why Should God not thro' Men's Thoughts work Wonders still more high 80 Than those which with the Elements are wrought! Where is He more than in Man's Soul? and where Should Wonders be more naturally sought Than there where He is most? and yet we stare At Seas rolled back, and Portents in the Air! The Springheaddepths of Wonder are alone In us! the Wonder of all Wonders there Exists, we are ourselves it, 'tis our own Highest Existence, and without it we have none, 81 For then we are not e'en ourselves! but he Who lives the Spirit which he is, lives by That Principle which is the Soul of the Great Whole, he lives in its Infinity, Therefore his Faith is infinite! his Eye Steady and calm, for his Belief is no Mere Creed or Dogma, something outwardly Professed, it is his Being, and doth flow From Nature's self, the Sum of all that he can know, 82 And be, and do, for without it he's naught! Without it Wisdom, Action, Life, is none! Now as by Nature this Belief is wrought Out in him, nay, as she herself alone Lives in him, as the Groundtruth of her own Existence it must be regarded, thro' Him in its highest, purest Aspect shown! And he in this full Feeling calm and true Of the great Whole, regards but as a few Grains to 83 The Seasands added, all the Wonders by The Pen of History recorded! for He feels God's Presence in him evernigh, The greatest Wonder, such as Eye ne'er saw, Nor Thought conceived! now Wonders 'gainst the Law Of Nature God worked out in Pity to Man's Frailty, but he claims far higher Awe For those wrought quietly by it, the tru- Est, suitablest, and which He most delights to do! 84 The most conformable also to his Own Nature: being Spirit he loves by The Spirit to reveal that which he is! Therefore be Spirit! thus most casily Thou'lt comprehend Him, for is he not thy Own Soul? then understanding it aright, Thou understandest Him! then too thine Eye Will need no fiery Bush to show his Might, For the whole World reveals him clearer to thy Sight 85 Than did that Bush to Moses! And what need Wilt thou have then of Tables, with thereon The ten Commandments graved, when thou canst read, And that too written by God's self alone, His Law eterne in thy own Heart? the one And allembracing Law, the godlike, the First Duty! which fulfilled, then there are none, All being summed in this, which is, to be A Law unto ourselves, like God, sublimely free! 86 Behold! the snowcapt Ural-mountains rise In the far Distance: Clouds hang lazy on Their Summits, purpled with the Eveningsky's Last Glory, and in Violettints upon Th' Horizon, barred and streaked with Gold, are thrown The craggy Outlines, sharp, distinct, and clear! Soft, golden Vapors, from the sinking Sun, Mantle their Summits, and as if quite near Seem Crag and Torrent in the aerial Atmosphere! 87 Now Fancy steep thy Wings in Rainbowtints, Bathe in the purple Light, and with thine Eye, Which no dull Film of human Weakness stints Or dims, behold the Vision! momently The Clouds into new Shapes are moulded by The sightless Winds, and, more intensely bright, Burn unconsuming, steeped so goldenly, Like to the Angelsplumage in the Sight Of God, when standing in his full, transfiguring Light! 88 The Landscape fades, but gaze on, for it is The Smile of the great Father, with which he Bids Goodnight to His Children! in its Bliss All Nature's steeped, breathless with Ecstacy! Now, Fancy, let the Past and Future be As two vast Wings to bear thee to yon' Height, And thence, as in that Smile transfigured, see, From its ideal Summit, (such as might Have been that whence the promis'd Land rose on the Sight 89 Of the great Prophet, in the far-off Beam Of Suns as yet not risen on the Eye Of Man!) of bygone Ages the long Stream Unrolled, the mighty Waters swelling high Between the Banks long Centuries left dry, And where, more pure and deep, they sweep on to The dimseen Ocean of Eternity! All this behold, for is not thine Eye too The Eye of God, then see godlike, and thou 'lt see true! 90 Yea, as a Seer! for the most Godlike is The most True, most Enduring, it is the Basis and Ground of all Things, e'en of this Coarse Being, not is only, but must be: For is not God the Ground of all, is he Not in each what is most enduring, true, Essential? then the Godlike whence would ye Save from Him draw? if then the Godlike you Make the Ground of your Life, God must be its Ground too! 91 And this Ground will not fail thee, it is thy Own self, if thou art godlike: then be so! And as it is the Ground of all Things, by Death it cannot be altered, undergo Change, save in Form, and that can be of no Importance, so long as the Ground in thee Is godlike: and as Form alone can flow From Spirit, that must also godlike be, E'en the Ungodlike thou mayst godlike feel and see! 92 So Fancy from that spectral Height look on Mankind, and what ungodlike there may be, Shall at that sublime Distance seem as none! And thou, thou too, the promised Land shalt see, For nobler is that Height, the View more free! The Real shall mingle too with that bright Dream, And clear Rays from a far Futurity To those, which now on Moscow's Towers gleam, Prophetic Brightness add! for even as the Stream 93 It stands on will flow still the same, when all That Pomp has crumbled into Dust, so too The Heart of Man shall Nature's sublime Call Bring back unto the Godlike and the True, Its only lasting Elements, and thro' Which only can its sublime Destiny Be wrought out: yea! these are the Portals to That promis'd Land of Freedom, whither by Greater than Prophet they are led, yea, the Mosthigh! 94 'Tis gone, 'tis gone! resolved once more into The Elements! that Day so long pass'd by, But which is present still to God's Allview, As Today or the farthest Morrow, thy Eye too, which shares in His Infinity, Divinest Fancy, still beholds! each Ray Has fled, Night's ebon Sceptre rules the Sky, And from the Womb of Darkness on their Way The newborn Torrents rush, tracked by their thundering Spray! 95 With these wild Truants let us to the Plain Descend, to where the Khama The Khama is a River which flows from the Ural-Mountains into the Volga. hurries to The Volga's Embrace, with whose Stream again Our Journey we must follow; but, still true To thy high Priviledge, thou shalt have due Use of thy Wings to help thee on the Way, Imagination! and, lo! full in View, The Towers of Nijeni, on which the Ray Of Sunset gleams, so swift the Elements obey! 96 Behold the Bridge where Prascovy must land; Thus far th' eternal Stream of Volga to The Consummation which her Love had plann'd Has helped her on: the Lasting and the True The True and Godlike, as it still should do, Assisting: lo! where two Streams blend in one, A fair, large City rises on her View, From whose thronged Streets each Soul long since is gone, As their own Shadows will be now, when sinks yon' Sun! 97 Near to the Bridge a Church and Convent stood, And thither Prascovy her Steps has bent: And, as she enters, hears in solemn Mood Sweet choral Bursts of female Voices, blent In Eveningworship, like an Omen sent From Heaven to her; then first in her grew To take the Veil the strong Wish and Intent, Her Heart, already cloistered and dead to The World, looked on it as Nuns thro' their Grate might do! 98 And, as she left the Church, she stopped to gaze Upon the Scene before her: gleaming lay The Volga's Waters in the Sunset's Blaze, And breathless Silence on the closing Day, As upon one about to cast away The garish Pleasures of the World, and take The Veil, like Nun, in Twilight's sober Gray, Attended: not a single Leaf did shake, Nor, save the rippling Stream, a Sound that Stillness break! 99 A wide Plain stretched before her, far and near, And Solitude lay on it like a Dream, Or Calm upon the Ocean, still as Fear! She gazed. and gazed, and watched each sinking Beam, The rosy Twilight fading from the Stream, Nature's eternal Smile! and softly o'er Her own Face stole its Blessedness, its Gleam Divine, as tho', when elsewhere seen no more, On Man's so godlike Face, diviner than before, 100 It reappeared, as it would ever do, Were Man, like Nature, pure and innocent! Sublime Reflection, like that which unto The Moon, when perfect and at Full, is sent, Tho' long before the Fires of Day are spent In Ocean, and the Orb to which she owes That Light has sunk; like the Omnipotent, Whom no Eye sees, tho' in all Things He shows Himself, whom none can grasp, and yet each feels and knows! 101 And where or what He is, none, none can tell, Save that He is all, and is everywhere! Who in each proves by such a Miracle His Being, that no Heart can ever dare To doubt Him, yet lays not that Being bare! Thus the first Miracle and greatest is Proved by almost as great a one! yet are Your Hearts but godlike, then too will ye His Being best comprehend, for ye yourselves are this! 102 Thus gazed she! but as yet she'd had to do With Nature only, and her Sympathies Were by that Intercourse kept sound and true, For there its godlike Nature naught belies, Each Flower of the Field, each Bird that flies, Is what God meant it to be, and it shows His Glory forth thus in most godlike Wise! The Rose has never ceased to be a Rose, And the Bird's Heart is as the Song which from it flows! 103 But now she had to do with Man, vain Man! The crooked Paths of human Policy, And not the sublime Ways of Nature's Plan, Where he who follows but his Heart and Eye, Need go to no School for Theology! He learns it from the Master, and that too From His best Work, and therefore thoroughly! And finds its Practice illustrated thro' Examples such as Poet's Fancy never drew! 104 Clear as the Stars, sweet as the Perfume of The Rose, and so, so easy to put too In Act and Use, that we have but to love To fulfill all its Precepts, make as true A Comment on it as the Sage could do! She turned her Head, and, lo! before her lay The peopled Solitude, not like that thro' Which she had lately passed upon her Way, The sublime Solitude of Nature, where Faith may 105 Draw nearer to her God, for there is naught To intercept; but like the Scene, so He Is by its Boundlessness more grandly brought Home to the Heart in all we feel and see! Sense fails, and Thought their Substitute must be This was the Solitude of Heart, where 'round Us thousands stand, and yet among them we Are lonely as a solitary Sound Voiced in a Desert, without Answer or Rebound! 106 This is the worst of Solitudes, where no Heart beats for us, when for its Sympathy Our own is yearning, where our Fellows throw Upon our passing Form a careless Eye, Which, like our Shadow, is as momently Forgot; where 'mid Abundance we must pine, And where the Ice of Form and Ceremony Chills all high Thoughts and Impulses divine, Where God himself is but a Sunday and a Sign! 107 All this, for the first Time, felt Prascovy, With a sad Sinking of the Heart, as she Beheld that City, with its thousands, lie Before her, 'mong whom not one Heart would be Glad at her Coming, not one sole Eye see Her with a Smile of Wellcome! then there came The Thought of her dear Parents bitterly Upon her Mind, with Doubts and Fears, and Shame At those same Doubts, 'till she herself began to blame 108 For slack Faith in her God; therefore into The Church she once more entered, half afraid, Lest God that Spirit should deny her, thro' Which He so oft had lent Advice and Aid; For if He sends no Spirit, we are made Ourselves the Spirit thro' firm Faith, which is Far better! and if this Faith be displayed In Word and Deed, that Spirit then is His Own Presence, and what Spirit need we beside this? 109 Here prayed she with such Fervour, that she drew The Notice of a Nun, to whose kind Ear She told her strong Disinclination to Seek Shelter at an Inn, related clear- Ly, simply, with that Eloquence which ne'er O'ersteps the Modesty of Nature, all Her Story, and thus gained new Friendships here, Thus God reveals Himself in Things so small, Yet far from small if felt to be from Him a Call!No third volume of this work was published.
