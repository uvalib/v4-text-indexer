      <field name="fulltext">THE Mouse-Trap: A POEM. Sing Muse, the Briton, who, on Mountains bred, And, like Saturnian Jove, with Goats-milk fed, In the close Prison of a wiry House, By Magic Cunning, first incag'd a Mouse, Notorious Felon, the dire Charms relate Which hurry'd on inextricable Fate. And Thou, O Phæbus, if that Sound delight Thy willing Ear, to aid the Poet's Flight, Or rather Smyntheus Thy Attention claim, To Ancient Mice a formidable Name: Now in my Breast let all thy Favour throng, And guide me in this unattempted Song. Forsake thy wonted Pindus, to descend From Cambrian Mountains, and my Toil befriend; While I, delighted with the Task, rehearse Small Actions, painted in Heroic Verse. A Mouse, a Creature of that salvage kind, Whom Nature form'd with a voracious Mind, Had long, unpunish'd, by successful Toil Flourish'd on Rapine, and grown rich with Spoil. Secure he rang'd, and, like a Villain, ply'd, Where Hunger prompted, and where Laws deny'd. By quick Excursions on each Dish he prey'd, And spoil'd the Viands, where his Teeth were laid. The nimble Rover, at each private Feast Intruded boldly, an unbidden Guest. Not Towers of Brass, nor Doors of Steel could bar The greedy Tyrant from incroaching War. Cheesecakes and Tarts to stop his raging Lust Were fortify'd in vain with brittle Crust. With unbought Victory his Arms were crown'd, He found no Bars, or eat through what He found. But while o'er all the World this Poison crept, Which, unreveng'd, the Desolation wept. Wales chiefly mourn'd the ruinous Disease, A Nation fam'd for Valour, and for Cheese. Cheese, the consummate Dish, and sound Delight For which alone a Mouse would Custards slight. For those by Fits, with nice and careless Play, He licks, and wantons in the milky Way. But Cheese supplys him with a double Treat, At Noon to riot, and at Night retreat, And be at once his Lodging, and his Meat. This does their Passions, Grief and Anger raise, And kindles the warm Nation to a Blaze. They tear and rave, and o'er the Mountains run, Fly to all Places, but at Ease in none. For, as Old Bards have in their Verses sung, The Cambrian Hearts with Wrath are quickly stung, As if their Souls, so wondrous prone to Ire, Were ting'd with Brimstone, and as soon took Fire. Nettled alike, now all consent to shed Their bloody Vengeance on the cursed Head Of the vile Caitiff; how they might insnare The wary Robber, was their prudent Care. Long they debated on the surest Course, Or secret Stratagem, or open Force; And what brave Captain should their Army lead, And quell the Monster in extremest Need. The conquering Cat, who many Battles won, By whom the Race was only not undone, Was now deem'd useless; tho' she us'd to keep A wakeful Guard, and nigh his Fastness creep, Or watch his Cavern with pretended Sleep. In vain, the Thief, behind his Lines immur'd, Was by his native Littleness secur'd. This was his Bulwark, and from hence he draws A strong Advantage on more potent Claws. For if by Chance he smelt the Sentry's Face, Backward he slunk to his retiring Place, Unpassable by stern Grimalkin's Race. Nor with new Sallies ventur'd out his Head, Till Danger with the watchful Pyrate fled. Safe in his Harbour, till the Coast was clear, Which help'd his Courage, and secur'd his Fear. So when Great Cæsar kept the World in awe, And Britain yielded to the Roman Law, (If Custom the Comparison allows Of Great with Small, a Welshman with a Mouse) The Welsh intrench'd, to shun the last of Ills, And burrough'd in their known impervious Hills. To Nature's Rampires the whole Nation flocks, And skulks behind impenetrable Rocks. Dispair compell'd them oft to quit the Field, They could not conquer, and they would not yield. Hence of Cadwalladars, and a long Row Of Ancestors, some thousand Years ago, They vaunt, as Heralds born, and proudly boast Their ancient Language, and unconquer'd Coast. Since then the Mouse with adversary Guiles Had oft out-general'd Grimalkin's Wiles. And Cambria could no farther Hope descry; Or from the Claws, or Craft of Her Ally. A Parliament is summon'd to appear And meet in Council on the Land's Frontier. Where now St. David's, once a noble Name, Mourns her lost Titles, and diminish'd Fame. Hither the Fathers, Lords, and Mob repair And strong with Brimstone scent the ambient Air. At this full Congress an old Sage appear'd With hoary Head, and venerable Beard, Envy'd by Goats, which on the Mountains graze; His Hands all o'er incrusted, and his Face Foul with the known Distemper of the Place. Worn out with Years, He on a Post reclin'd, Which Cambrian Shoulders often us'd to grind, Unloaded the Resentment of his Mind. He turn'd his Whiskers with a graceful Stroke, And in deep Tone, thus the grave Father spoke. “We're not assembled to provide Relief “'Gainst open Foes, but a clandestine Thief: “No fierce Invader from some foreign Part, “But lodg'd, and harbour'd in the Country's Heart: “The barb'rous Tyrant ranges where he please, “And, absolute, invades our Lorded Cheese. “O Woe! O Grief of Griefs! O galling Shame “To the try'd Valour of the Cambrian Name! “Shall we obey a sawcy Mouse, whose Rules “Are absolute, and made for Passive Fools: “No—let it ne'er be said—but let us try “Our Force, and conquer in the Cause, or dye. “Grave Senators, and venerable Peers, “Your Country's Sword and Shield, remove our Fears. “If any Hope or Remedy be left, “Unite, and combat with the growing Theft: “So shall your Arms our ancient Fame renew, “And brave Cadwalladars revive in You. He said, and then exposing to their sight Half-eaten Relicks of the Tyrant's Spite; Trophies of Rapine, which too sure betray How by the dint of Teeth he forc'd his way, And printed Conquest on his mouldy Prey. This stings the Blood, this blows the raging Fire, And with new Fewel feeds the Cambrian Ire. This in their Hearts does Emulation breed, Some dire Revenge, and some th'Heroic Deed Inflames with Thirst of Glory; all contend By various Deaths to work the Robber's end, And hammer on the Anvil of their Brain Incredible Machines of cruel Pain. The bearded Sires are on Destruction bent, And Fortune labours with the vast Event. But one above the rest was most renown'd, Taffy his Name, than whom was never found A smarter Genius in the Country round. No Blacksmith for a Senator more fit, Surpassing all at Hammer or at Wit. He wav'd the greasy Profits of his Trade Whenever injur'd Wales implor'd his Aid. In Words, like these, the brave illustrious Man Attack'd his Audience, and he thus began. “Fathers and Brethren, if the Fame decrease “Of our rich Morsels, and our envy'd Cheese, “The hungry Ploughman will most Damage feel, “And lose at Supper a substantial Meal. “The Wealthy too will have a Loser's share, “And crown no Banquets with the dainty Fare. “Since they nor we are able to withstand “The salvage Monsters which infest the Land, “Since nor Grimalkin's Strength, nor Fraud prevail, “I'll try, if this Right Hand, this Head will fail. “'Tis all the same, if with Success we meet, “Whether we gain by Valour or Deceit. This strikes the Reverend Council with Surprize; They gape, and stare, and listen with their Eyes. A sudden Joy does every Heart dilate In silent Wishes for their better Fate, To know the Means they earnestly desire, And what, and when, and where, and how, inquire? Then Taffy scratch'd his Head, a pleasure grown Familiar to the Cambrian Clime alone. He grinn'd a horrid Laugh, and thus he said; “When Yester Night had cast her silent Shade, “And me surrender'd to refreshing Sleep, “Which on my Limbs and Eyes began to creep: “A Mouse audacious follow'd by degrees “The fumy Steams of unconcocted Cheese, “Which from my Mouth I threw; the Pyrate leap'd “Thro' my unguarded Jaws, and down she slip'd “Into my Bowels, and began to prey “On th'undigested Meals of yesterday. “But while his Way the Thief returning sought, “I snapt him, and betwixt my Grinders caught; “Wak'd from my Sleep at some surprizing Thought, “In vain the Rebel struggled, and in vain “Us'd his poor Strength to break the biting Chain. “This Hint at last revolving in my Mind, “How Mice might be subdu'd, if once confin'd; “The Notions crouded in my teeming Head, “And a new Prison and new Fetters made, “From such a Model fashion'd and dispos'd, “As the late Captive of my Teeth inclos'd. “O wondrous! by what Art, what secret Springs “The Hand of Jove moves sublunary things! “How Nature does a constant tenour keep! “And what Effects from unthought Causes leap! “Th'instructive Mouse has taught us now to save “Our Cheese, and make the Conqueror a Slave, “And tho' unwilling, cures the Wounds he gave. “Nor blush, Grave Sires, that to a Mouse you owe “The Stratagem to work his Overthrow; “'Tis wise to take Instructions from a Foe. This said, the Congress rose, and Taffy strait To his respective Home repairs in State: Peals of Applauses from th'attending Throng Wounded the æther, as he past along. The tattling Nurses spread abroad his Fame, And lisping Infants stammer out his Name: All full of Tafey, none but Taffy sing, What Wonders from his mighty Wit would spring; How great the Nation's better Hope would grow By conqu'ring an Hereditary Foe. But while they offer up their Prayers, to bless His Brain's ingenious Issue with Success, Lo! wond'rous to behold! the sober Cat, Who by the Fire but now demurely sate, Brisk as a Kitling, twirl'd her boding Tail, And, if the Faith of Poets may prevail, The Curds were seen to dance within the Milking Pail. Mean time with Tooth and Nail, with Hand and Brain, Did Taffy, like another Vulcan, strain; While Pallas help'd him with her Art, and Oil, To finish his Divine, laborious Toil, A Mouse-trap call'd, nor heard before, nor seen, A wond'rous Tragi-comical Machine. And now, my Muse, do Thou vouchsafe to smile, Describe this Fabric in no vulgar Style, And paint the nicest Parts of the stupendious Pile; In form Quadrangular two Planks are laid, One founds the Basis, and one crowns the Head. The Sides around are fortify'd with Wires, On which strong Columns the whole House aspires. An Entry does insidiously entice With hospitable Look the Pilgrim Mice: But from above depends a threat'ning Board, Hung by a Twine, like Damocles's Sword. (So all are serv'd by Fates, who weave the Doom Of Mice and Men upon one common Loom!) High on the Surface of the Fabric stands A Pole, on whose notch'd Head a Beam expands Its wooden Arms, and pois'd alike in all, One End mount upwards by the others Fall. Within the Dome a slender Wire depends, Which from the Top thro' a small Hole descends, Which pendulously wantons here and there, And at the slightest Touch plays loose in Air: The lower Part a Hook, portending Fate, But flesh'd and brib'd with an alluring Bait: The upper Part does treacherously seem To bite with Iron Tooth th'extreamest Beam; But soon as she has felt the nibling Foe, She drops her Hold, and lets the Portal go: There without Bail, or Main-prize, or Relief, She shops for Life (too short!) the greedy Thief. Thus far has Taffy play'd the Builder's part, A Pile erected by the Rules of Art. But now to furnish his Enchanted House, And kill with Kindness the devoted Mouse; In Flames he fortifies the scented Bait, And loads the cheating Hook with luscious Fate. And now was come the memorable Night, Design'd to do the suffering Cambrians Right. Down on his Bed undaunted Taffy lay, And in soft Slumbers lost the Toils of Day; The friendly Engine nigh his Pillow kept A faithful Guard, while the bold Hero slept. Mean time the Mice, a frisking Nation, play'd, Protected by the Night's officious Shade. A Mouse of high Degree did first expose His valiant Life in quest of Prey, and Foes, Of sharpest Teeth, and most sagacious Nose. But vain's our Courage, if a luckless Sign With Beams malignant on our Cradle shine; Or if a Mouse of hopeful Parts be torn, Grimalkin's Victim, and a Welchman's Scorn. Up strait the Leader march'd his Prey to seize; For to his Nostrils some auspicious Breeze Had born the grateful Scent of toasted Cheese. But wiry Pallisades impeach his Way, And the first Onset of his Fury stay. Yet his great Soul a vile Repulse disdains, And double Vigour from Resistance gains; With curling Nose and searching Beard explores An Entrance at th'inexorable Doors, Which upward held, the willing Guest admit To taste his Ruin in the savoury Bit; Then dropping downwards with a frightful Sound, Th'unhappy Captain of the Mice surround. The sudden Noise rous'd Taffy from Repose, Who at the Call of Victory arose: He burns impatiently to know, and learn This new Adventure of a high Concern. Mean time the Mouse, his Conquest, raves within, And bounces in th'irrefragable Gin. New to this Prison, and new-fashion'd Hold, He fumes, and stamps, like Bajazet of Old. His Head against the slender Bars he beats, And with mad Teeth th'impassive Iron eats: So when a Hunter toils a Marsian Boar, The Woods rebellow with his hideous roar; The Youth around his idle Tusks deride, The Sport of Mastiffs, who afflict his Side: His useless Foam he on his Shoulders throws, And on his Back a bristly Forrest grows. The Morning Sun discovers to the Sight The Triumphs of the Trap, and silent Night. From their steep Mountains the swift Cambrians run, And with Huzza's proclaim the Battle won. The Ass, an Enemy to Toil and Pain, Had chang'd his Nature to a merry Vein: Frisk'd like a Kid, and like a Lambkin play'd, And thrice the public Joy he loudly bray'd: Thee, Taffy, thrice he roars to Hills around, Thee, Taffy, thrice the ecchoing Hills resound. The hooting Owl (since that auspicious Time Declar'd the Herald of the Cambrian Clime) All Night through open Streets and Cities flew, And his presaging Beak against the Windows threw: Loudly he rang from his unluckly Throat The Captive's fatal Knell with dismal Note. The Mountains travel, and from Pembroke come A Clan of Tenants, from Merioneth-shire. Mervinia some: Some Colonies from Carmarthen. Maridunum throng, Renown'd for Merlin in the British Song. With those who dwell nigh mitred Bangor's Walls, And those, where Vaga into Severn falls; With those who climb Montgomery's steep Hill, Or fruitful Valleys of Glamorgan till. Then Taffy with sarcastic Voice exults, And thus the raging little Slave insults: “In vain, vile Caitiff, dost Thou tear and rend, “And at the Bar of Destiny contend: “In vain with stamping Feet and Teeth assail, “Nor will thy boasted Littleness prevail. “Remember now, thy Thefts and Plunders all “Start up in Judgment, and for Vengeance call. “In vain you seek just Punishment to fly, “Those Bars all Hopes of an Escape deny. “No! wicked Victim, thou art doom'd to bleed, “And with thy Blood this Floor, this Altar feed; “And may all ravenous Mice, like thee, succeed! He said, and Puss, who the Proceedings spy'd, Leap'd from a neighb'ring Roof's warm Sunny side, Where she was wont to bask, and wear away In Luxury and Ease a Summer's Day. The captive Mouse had ken'd her from afar, And now intent to shun the coming War, He seeks no Flight, but more improv'd in Fears, Bristles his crumpled Back, and pricks his Ears; To scape the stern devouring Mouser's Jaws, His Hope of Safety from his Prison draws, And hugs his Fetters with tenacious Claws. But all in vain; for Puss expecting lay With nimble Feet to seize her panting Prey; On whom, when shaken from his Holds, she flies, And fixes cruel Kisses on her Prize. She tells what secret Joys within prevail, By wanton Motions of her twirling Tail. Sometimes she, careless, on the Ground reclines, Still watchful on her Captive's dark Designs; Sometimes she paws his Neck, and licks his Face, And girds him with a barbarous Embrace: With sportive Cruelty, a subtle Task, She acts the Tyrant in a Lover's Mask. But now the merry Scene of Action's past, And, like an unfed Lioness, at last, Tir'd with her wanton Play, and trifling Toil, She growls and grumbles o'er her trembling Spoil; And while his Bowels and his Limbs she rends, Loud Acclamation to the Clouds ascends. Eccho, the Tenant of the Cambrian Hills, With the repeated Shout the Caverns fills. Brechin, and Snowdon, and Plinlimmon's Mount, And Offa's Ditch the various Toils recount: Resound the Fortune of their Country's Wars, Their slaughter'd Tyrant, and their finish'd Jars, And bear the Triumph to the neighb'ring Stars. But thou, O Taffy, in my Verse shalt live The long Eternity which Poets give. The Welsh with annual Joy preserve thy Fame, Thou brightest Honour of the Cambrian Name! Thy Country does with Gratitude o'erflow, And tho' no Conquering Bays she can bestow, Yet fragrant Leaks shall for thy Brows instead of Laurel grow. FINIS.</field>
