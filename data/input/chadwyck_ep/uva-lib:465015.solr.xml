      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I POEMS AND TRANSLATIONS Square brackets denote editorial emendations or insertions. I A PASTORAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN THIRSIS AND STREPHON Thirsis.] Strephon, O Strephon, once the jolliest Lad, That with shrill Pipe did ever Mountain glad; Whilome the Foremost at our rural Plays, The Pride and Envy of our Holidays: Why dost thou now sit musing all alone, Teaching the Turtles, yet a sadder Moan? Swell'd with thy Tears, why does the Neighbouring Brook Bear to the Ocean, what she never took? Thy Flocks are fair and fruitful, and no Swain, Then thee, more welcome to the Hill or Plain. Strep.] I could invite the Wolf, my cruel Guest, And play unmov'd, while he on all should feast: I cou'd endure that every Swain out-run, Out-threw, out-wrestled, and each Nymph shou'd shun The hapless Strephon.— Thir.] Tell me then thy Grief, And give it, in Complaints, some short Releif. Strep.] Had killing Mildews nipt my rising Corn, My Lambs been all found dead, as soon as born; Or raging Plagues run swift through every Hive, And left not one industrious Bee alive; Had early Winds, with an hoarse Winter's Sound Scatter'd my rip'ning Fruit upon the Ground: Unmov'd, untoucht, I cou'd the Loss sustain, And a few Days expir'd, no more complain. Thir.] E're the Sun drank of the cold Morning-dew, I've known thee early the tuskt Boar pursue: Then in the Evening drive the Bear away, And rescue from his Jaws the trembling Prey. But now thy Flocks creep feebly through the Fields, No purple Grapes, thy half drest Vine-yards yields: No Primrose nor no Violets grace thy Beds, But Thorns and Thistles lift their prickly Heads. What means this Change? Strep.] Enquire no more; When none can heal, 'tis Pain to search the Sore; Bright Galatea, in whose Mateless Face Sat rural Innocence, with heavenly Grace; In whose no less inimitable Mind, With equal Light, even distant Virtues shin'd; Chast without Pride, and Charming without Art, Honour the Tyrant of her tender Heart: Fair Goddess of these Fields, who for our Sports, Though she might well become, neglected Courts. Belov'd of all, and loving me alone, Is from my Sight, I fear, for ever gone. Thir.] Thy Case indeed is pitiful, but yet Thou on thy Loss too great a Price dost set. Women like Days are Strephon, some be far More bright and glorious than others are: Yet none so gay, so temperate, so clear, But that the like adorne the rowling Year. Pleasures imparted, to a Friend encrease, Perhaps divided Sorrow may grow less. Strep.] Others as fair, to other Eyes may seem, But she has all my Love and my Esteem: Her bright Idea wanders in my Thought, At once my Poison, and my Antidote. Thir.] Our Hearts are Paper, Beauty is the Pen, Which writes our Loves, and blots 'em out agen. Phillis is Whiter than the rising Swan, Her slender Wast confin'd within a Span: Charming as Nature's Face in the new Spring, When early Birds on the green Branches sing. When rising Herbs and Buds begin to hide, Their naked Mother, with their short-liv'd Pride, Cloe is ripe, and as the Autumn fair, When on the Elm the purple Grapes appear. When Trees, Hedg-rows, and every bending Bush, With rip'ning Fruit, or tasteful Berries blush, Lydia is in the Summer of her Days, What Wood can shade us from her piercing Rays? Her even Teeth, whiter than new yean'd Lambs, When they with tender Cries pursue their Dams. Her Eyes as Charming as the Evening-sun, To the scortcht Labourer when Work is done, Whom the glad Pipe, to rural Sports invites, And pays his Toil with innocent Delights. On some of these fond Swain fix thy Desire, And burn not with imaginary Fire. Strep.] The Stag shall sooner with the Eagle soar, Seas leave their Fishes naked on the Shore; The Wolf shall sooner by the Lambkin die, And from the Kid the hungry Lion fly, Than I abandon Galatea's Love, Or her dear Image from my Thoughts remove. Thir.] Damon this Evening carries home his Bride, In all the harmless Pomp of rural Pride: Where, for two spotted Lambkins, newly yean'd, With nimble Feet and Voice, the Nimphs contend: And for a Coat, thy Galatea spun, The Shepherds Wrastle, throw the Bar, and Run. Strep.] At that dear Name I feel my Heart rebound, Like the old Steed, at the fierce Trumpet's sound: I grow impatient of the least Delay, No Dastard Swain shall bear the Prize away. Thir.] Let us make hast, already they are met; The ecchoing Hills their joyful Shouts repeat. II SONG Phillis, let's shun the common Fate, And let our Love ne'r turn to Hate; I'll dote no longer then I can, Without being call'd a faithless Man. When we begin to want Discourse, And Kindness seems to tast of Force, As freely as we met, we'll part, Each one possest of their own Heart. Thus whilst rash Fools themselves undo; We'll Game, and give off Savers too; So equally the Match we'll make, Both shall be glad to draw the Stake: A Smile of thine shall make my Bliss, I will enjoy thee in a Kiss; If from this Height our Kindness fall, We'll bravely scorn to Love at all: If thy Affection first decay, I will the Blame on Nature lay. Alas, what Cordial can remove The hasty Fate of dying Love? Thus we will all the World excel In Loving, and in Parting well. III SONG Not Celia, that I juster am Or better than the rest, For I would change each Hour like them, Were not my Heart at rest. But I am ty'd to very thee, By every Thought I have, Thy Face I only care to see, Thy Heart I only crave. All that i[n] Woman is ador'd, In thy dear Self I find, For the whole Sex can but afford, The Handsome and the Kind. Why then should I seek farther Store, And still make Love a-new; When Change itself can give no more, 'Tis easie to be true. IV [Thirsis no more against my Flame advise] Thirsis no more against my Flame advise, But let me be in Love, and be you wise: Here end, and there begin a new Address, Pursue the vulgar easie Happiness: Leave me to Amaranta, who alone Can in my sullen Heart erect her Throne: I know, as well as you, 'tis mean to burn, For one who to our Flame makes no return: But you, like me, feel not those conquering Eyes, Which mock Prevention by a quick Surprize: And now like a hurt Deer, in vain I start From her, that in my Breast has hid the Dart. Though I can never reach her Excellence, Take somewhat in my hopeless Love's defence. Her Beauty is her not esteemed Wealth, And Graces play about her Eyes by stealth; Vertue in others, the forc'd Child of Art, Is but the native Temper of her Heart: All Charms her Sex so often court in vain, (Like Indian Fruit, which our cold Earth disdain.) In her grow wild, as in their native Air, And she has all Perfection without Care. Of Lovers Harms she has the tend'rest Sense, That can consist with so much Innocense. Like a wise Prince, she rules her Subjects so, That neither Want, nor Luxury they know. None vainly hoping what, she may not give, Like humble Slaves at small Expence we live: And I the wretched Comfort only share, To be the Least whom she will bid Dispair. V TO CLORIS Cloris, I cannot say your Eyes Did my unwary Heart surprize; Nor will I swear it was your Face, Your Shape, or any nameless Grace: For you are so intirely Fair, To love a Part, Injustice were; No drowning Man can know which Drop Of Water his last Breath did stop; So when the Stars in Heaven appear, And joyn to make the Night look clear; The Light we no one's Bounty call, But the obliging Gift of all. He that does Lips or Hands adore, Deserves them only, and no more; But I love All, and every Part, And nothing less can ease my Heart. Cupid, that Lover, weakly strikes, Who can express what 'tis he likes. VI INDIFFERENCE EXCUSED Love, when 'tis true, needs not the aid Of Sighs nor Oaths to make it known; And, to convince the cruel'st Maid, Lovers should use their Love alone: Into their very Looks 'twill steal; And he that most wou'd hide his Flame, Does in that Case his Pain reveal, Silence it self can Love proclaim. This my Aurelia made me shun, The Paths that common Lovers tread: Whose guilty Passions are begun Not in their Heart, but in their Head. I cou'd not Sigh, and with cross'd Arms Accuse your Rigour and my Fate, Nor tax your Beauty with such Charms As Men adore, and Women hate: But careless liv'd, and without Art, Knowing my Love you must have spy'd, And thinking it a foolish Part, To set to shew, what none can hide. VII ORINDA TO CLORIS Cloris, you live ador'd by all, And yet on none your Favours fall. A stranger Mistress ne're was known; You pay 'em all in paying none. We him of Avarice accuse, Who what he has forbears to use; But what Disease of Mind shall I Call this, thy hated Penury? Thou wilt not give out of a Store, Which no Profuseness can make poor. Misers, when dead, they make amends, And in their Wills enrich their Friends; But when thou dy'st, thy Treasure dies, And thou canst leave no Legacies. What Madness is it then to spare, When we want Power to make an Heir? Live, Cloris, then at the full Rate Of thy great Beauty; and since Fate, To Love and Youth, is so severe, Enjoy 'm freely while th' art here. Some Caution yet I'd have thee use, When e're thou dost a Servant chuse: Men are not all for Lovers fit, No more than Arms, or Arts of Wit: For Wisdom some respected are, Some we see poweful at the Bar; Some for Preferment waste their Time, And the steep Hill of Honour climb. Others of Love their Business make, In Love their whole Diversion take. Take one of those; for in one Breast Two Passions live but ill at rest: Be wise, and with Discretion fly All that take Flame at every Eye. All sorts with powder'd Coat and Hair; All that dare more than think thee Fair, Take one of Love who nothing says, And yet whom every Word betrays; Love in the Cradle pretty'st shews. And when't can speak, unruly grows. VIII THE COMPLAINT When fair Aurelia first became The Mistress of his Heart, So mild and gentle was her Reign, Thirsis in hers had part. Reserves and Care he laid aside, And gave a Loose to Love; The headlong Course he must abide, How steep so e're it prove. At first Disdain and Pride he fear'd; But they being overthrown, No second Foe a while appear'd, And he thought all his own: He thought himself a happier Man Than ever lov'd before; Her Favours still his Hopes out-ran, Yet still he lov'd the more: Love smil'd at first, then looking grave, Said, Thirsis, leave to boast; More Joy than all her Kindness gave, Her Fickleness will cost. He spoke, and from that fatal Time, All Thirsis did, or said, Appear'd unwelcome, or a Crime To the ungrateful Maid. IX CONSTANCY Fear not, my Dear, a Flame can never dye, That is once kindled by so bright an Eye; View but thy self, and measure thence my Love, Think what a Passion such a Form must move; For though thy Beauty first allur'd my Sight, Now I consider it but as the Light That led me to the Treasury of thy Mind, Whose inward Vertue in that Feature shin'd. That Knot be confident will ever last, Which Fancy ty'd, and Reason has made fast; So fast that time, although it may disarm Thy lovely Face, my Faith can never harm; And Age deluded, when it comes, will find My Love removed, and to thy Soul assign'd. X THE PLATONICK Fair Amaranta, wert thou not to blame, To blow the Fire, and wonder at the Flame? I did converse, 'tis true, so far was mine, But that I lov'd, and hop'd was wholly thine; Not hop'd as others do, for a Return, But that I might without offending burn. I thought those Eyes which every Hour enslave Could not remember all the Wounds they gave: Forgotten in the Crowd I wisht to lie, And of your Coldness, not your Anger, die; Yet since you know I love, 'tis now no time Longer to hide, let me excuse the Crime, Seeing what Laws I to my Passion give, Perhaps you may consent that it should live: First then, it never shall a Hope advance, Of waiting on you, but by seeming chance; I at a distance will adore your Eyes, As awful Persians do the Eastern Skies; I never will presume to think of Sex, Nor with gross Thoughts my deathless Love perplex; I tread a pleasant Path without Design; And to thy Care my Happiness resign: From Heaven it self thy Beauty cannot be A freer Gift, than is my Love to thee. XI TO CELIA You tell me, Celia, you approve, Yet never must return my Love: An Answer that my Hope destroys, And in the Cradle wounds our Joys; To kill at once what needs must die, None would to Birds and Beast[s] deny. How can you then so Cruel prove, As to preserve, and torture Love? That Beauty Nature kindly meant For her own Pride, and our Content; Why shou'd the Tyrant Honour make Our cruel undeserved Wrack? In Love and War th' Impostor do's The Best to greatest Harms expose: Come then, my Celia, let's no more This Devil for a God adore; Like foolish Indians we have been, Whose whole Religion is a Sin: Let's lose no Time then but repent, Love welcomes best a Penitent. XII HER ANSWER Thirsis, I wish, as well as you, To Honour there were nothing due, Then would I pay my Debt of Love In the same Coin that you approve; Which now you must in Friendship take, 'Tis all the Payment I can make; Friendship so high, that I must say, 'Tis rather Love, with some Allay; And rest contented, since that I As well my self as you deny. Learn then of me, bravely to bear, The want of what you hold most dear; And that which Honour does in me, Let my Example work in thee. XIII TO AMARANTA WHOM HE FELL IN LOVE WITH AT A PLAY-HOUSE Fair Amaranta on the Stage, whilst you Pitty'd a feigned Love, you gave a true; The Hopes and Fears, in every Scene exprest, Grew soon th' uneasie Motions of my Breast. I thought to steal the innocent Delight, And not have paid my Heart for a first Sight. And if I ventur'd on some slight Discourse, It should be such as could no Passion nurse: Led by the treacherous Lustre of your Eyes, At last I play'd too near the Precipice: Love came disguis'd in Wonder and Delight, His Bow unbent, his Arrows out of sight; Your Words fell on my Passion, like those Showers, Which paint and multiply the rising Flowers; Like Cupid's self, a God, and yet a Child, Your Looks at once were awful, and yet mild: Methoughts you blush'd, as conscious of my Flame, Whilst your strict Vertue did your Beauty blame: But rest secure, y'are from the Guilt as free As Saints ador'd from our Idolatry. XIV THE SUBMISSION Ah! Pardon, Madam; if I ever thought Your smallest Favours could too dear be bought; And the just Greatness of your Servants Flame, I did the Poorness of their Spirits name; Calling their long Attendance Slavery, Your Power of Life and Death flat Tyranny; Since now I yield, and do confess there is No way too hard that leads to such Bliss. So when Hippomanes beheld the Race, Where Loss was Death, and Conquest but a Face, He stood amazed at the fatal Strife, Wondring that Love shou'd dearer be than Life; But when he saw the Prize no longer staid, But through those very Dangers sought the Maid, And won her too: O may his Conquest prove, A happy Omen to my purer Love; Which if the Honour of all Victory, In the Resistance of the Vanquisht lie, Though it may be the least regarded Prize, Is not the smallest Trophy of our Eyes. XV TO A DEVOUT YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN Phillis, this early Zeal asswage, You over-act your part; The Martyrs, at your tender Age, Gave Heaven but half their Heart. Old Men (till past the Pleasure) ne're Declaim against the Sin; 'Tis early to begin to fear The Devil at Fifteen. The World to Youth is too severe, And, like a treacherous Light, Beauty, the Actions of the Fair, Exposes to their sight. And yet this World, as old as 'tis, Is oft deceiv'd by't too; Kind Combinations seldom miss, Let's try what we can do. XVI TO CELIA Princes make Laws, by which their Subjects live, And the high Gods Rules for the Worship give; How should poor Mortals else a Service find At all proportion'd to their heavenly Mind? Had it been left to us, each one would bring, Of what he lik'd himself, an Offering; And with unwelcome Zeal perhaps displease Th' offended Deity he would appease. All Powers but thine, this Mercy did allow, And how they wou'd be serv'd, themselves do shew. A rude Barbarian wou'd his captiv'd Foe Fully instruct in what he'd have him do: And can it be, my Celia, that Love, Less kind than War shou'd to the vanquish'd prove? Say, cruel Fair, must then my Heart, a Flame, Use for a while Friendship's Disguise and Name? Or may it boldly like it self appear, And its own Tale deliver to thy Ear? Or must it in my tortur'd Bosom live, Like Fire in unmov'd Flints, and no Light give, And only then humbly send forth a small Spark, when your self does on that Subject fall? My Passion can with any Laws comply, And, for your sake, do any thing, but die. XVII SONG Get you gone, you will undo me, If you love me, don't pursue me, Let that Inclination perish, Which I dare no longer cherish; With harmless Thoughts I did begin, But in the Crowd Love entred in; I knew him not, he was so gay, So innocent and full of play; At every Hour, in every Place, I either saw or form'd your Face; All that in Plays was finely writ, Fancy for you, and me did fit. My Dreams at Night were all of you, Such as till then I never knew: I sported thus with young Desire, Never intending to go higher: But now his Teeth and Claws are grown, Let me the fatal Lion shun; You found me harmless, leave me so; For were I not, you'd leave me too. XVIII A DIALOGUE BETWEEN AMINTAS AND CELIA Celia.] Amintas, I am come alone, A silly harmless Maid, But whether is thy Honour flown? I fear I am betray'd; Thy Looks are chang'd and in the Place Of innocent Desires, Methinks I see thy Eyes and Face Glow with unusual Fires. Amintas.] Sees not my Celia, Nature wear One Countenance in the Spring, And yet another Shape prepare, To bring the Harvest in? Look on the Eagle, how unlike He to the Egg is found, When he prepares his Pownce to strike His Prey against the Ground; Fears might my Infant-love become, 'Twere want of Vigor now Should Modesty those Hopes benum, The Place and You allow. Celia.] Amintas, hold; What could you worse To worst of Women do? Ah! how could you a Passion nurse, So much my Honour's Foe? Amintas.] Make not an Idol of a Toy, Which every Breath can shake, Which all must have, or none enjoy, What Course soe're we take. Whilst Women hate, or Men are vain, You cannot be secure; What makes my Celia then a Pain So needless to endure? Celia.] Could I the World neglect for thee, Thy Love, though dear it cost, In some unkind Conceit of me, Would be untimely lost: Thou would'st thy own Example fear, And every heedless Word, I chance let fall beyond thy Ear Would some new Doubt afford. Amintas.] If I am jealous, 'tis because I know not where you love; With me obey Love's gentle Laws And all my Fears remove. Celia.] Women, like Things at Second-hand Do half their Value lose, But whil'st all Courtship they withstand, May at their Pleasure choose. Amintas.] This were a fine Discourse, my Dear, If we were not alone; But now Love whispers in my Ear, There's somewhat to be done. She said she never would forgive; He kissing, swore she shou'd; And told her, she was mad to strive Against their mutual Good. What farther past, I cannot tell But sure not much amiss; He vow'd he lov'd her dearly well, She answered with a Kiss. XIX SONG Drink about till the Day find us; These are Pleasures that will last; Let no foolish Passion blind us, Joys of Love they fly too fast. Maids are long e're we can win 'um, And out Passions waste the while, In a Beer-glass we'll begin 'um, Let some Beau take th' other Toil. Yet we will have store of good Wenches, Though we venture fluxing for't, Upon Couches, Chairs, and Benches, To out-do them at the Sport, Joyning thus both Mirth and Beauty, To make up our full Delight: In Wine and Love we pay our Duty To each friendly coming Night. XX SONG Love still has somthing of the Sea, From whence his Mother rose; No time his Slaves from Doubt can free, Nor give their Thoughts repose: They are becalm'd in clearest Days, And in rough Weather tost; They wither under cold Delays, Or are in Tempests lost. One while they seem to touch the Port, Then straight into the Main, Some angry Wind in cruel sport The Vessel drives again. At first Disdain and Pride they fear, Which if they chance to 'scape, Rivals and Falshood soon appear In a more dreadful shape. By such Degrees to Joy they come, And are so long withstood, So slowly they receive the Sum, It hardly does them good. 'Tis cruel to prolong a Pain, And to defer a Joy; Believe me, gentle Celemene Offends the winged Boy. An hundred thousand Oaths your Fears Perhaps would not remove; And if I gaz'd a thousand Years I could no deeper love. XXI SONG Phillis, you have enough enjoy'd The Pleasures of Disdain; Methinks your Pride shou'd now be cloy'd, And grow it self again: Open to Love your long-shut Breast, And entertain its sweetest Guest. Love heals the Wounds that Beauty gives, And can ill Usage slight; He laughs at all that Fate contrives, Full of his own Delight; We in his Chains are happier far Than Kings themselves without 'em are. Leave then to tame Philosophy, The Joys of Quietness; With me into Love's Empire fly; And taste my Happiness: Where even Tears and Sighs can show Pleasures, the Cruel never know. XXII [Madam, for your Commands to stay] Madam, for your Commands to stay, Is the mean Duty of a Wretch, Whose Service you with Wages pay; Lovers should at occasion catch, Not idly wait till it be brought, But with the Deed o're take your Thought; Honour and Love let them give o're, Who do their Duty, and no more. XXIII [Awake, my Eyes, at Night my Thought[s] pursue] Awake, my Eyes, at Night my Thought[s] pursue You charming Shape; and find it ever new; If I my weary Eyes to Sleep resign, In gaudy Dreams your Love and Beauty shine; Dreams with such Extasies and Pleasures fill'd, As to those Joys they seem can only yield; Nor do they yield perhaps, wou'd you allow, Fair Amidea, that I once might know. XXIV TO CELIA As in those Nations, where they yet adore Marble and Cedar, and their Aid, implore: 'Tis not the Workman, nor the precious Wood, But 'tis the Worshipper that makes the God; So, cruel Fair, though Heaven has giv'n you all, We Mortals (Vertue or can Beauty) call, 'Tis we that give the Thunder to your Frowns, Darts to your Eyes, and to our selves the Wounds: Without our Love, which proudly you deride, Vain were your Beauty, and more vain your Pride; All envy'd Beings that the World can shew, Still to some meaner things their greatness owe, Subjects make Kings, and we (the numerous Train Of humble Lovers) constitute thy Reign, This difference only Beauty's Realm may boast, Where most it favours, it enslaves the most; And they to whom it is indulgent found, Are ever in the surest Fetters bound: What Tyrant yet, but thee, was ever known Cruel to those that serv'd to make him one? Valour's a Vice, if not with Honour joyn'd, Beauty a raging Plague, if never kind. XXV SONG I ask not my Celia would love me again, In its own Pleasure my Love is o're-paid; I'll find such Excuses for all her Disdain, That shortly to Frown I'll make her afraid. Her Neglect of me, of her self I'll think Care; Her Cruelty I her strict Vertue will name; When least kind she seems, I'll believe her most near, And call her Refusal, but a Virgin's Shame. Thus all that was wont hertofore to cure Love In me shall increase, and stir up the Fire; I'll make her at last some kind Remedy prove, Since all others but increase my Desire. XXVI SONG Fair Aminta, art thou mad, To let the World in me Envy Joys I never had, And censure them in thee? Fill'd with Grief, for what is past, Let us at length be wise, And to Love's true Enjoyments hast, Since we have paid the Price. Love does easie Souls despise, Who lose themselves for Toys, And escape for those devise, Who taste his utmost Joys. Love should, like the Year, be crown'd With sweet Variety; Hope should in the Spring abound, Kind Fears, and Jealousie. In the Summer Flowers should rise, And in the Autumn Fruit; His Spring doth else but mock our Eyes, And in a Scoff salute. XXVII SONG Walking among thick Shades alone, I heard a distant Voice, Which, sighing, said, Now she is gone, I'll make no second Choice. I look't and saw it was a Swain, Who to the flying Wind, Did of some neighbouring Nymph complain, Too fair, and too unkind. He told me how he saw her first, And with what gracious Eyes, And gentle Speech, that Flame she nurst, Which since she did despise. His Vows she did as fast receive, As he could breath 'em to her; Love in her Eyes proclaim'd her leave, That he alone should woo her. They fed their Flocks still near one Place, And at one instant met, He gazing on her lovely Face Fell deeper in the Net. She seem'd of her new Captive glad; Proud of his Bondage he, No Lover, sure a Prospect had Of more Felicity. But the false Maid, or never lov'd, Or gave so quickly o're; E're his was to the height improv'd, Her Kindness was no more. Even her Dissemblings she let fall, And made him plainly see, That though his Heart she did enthral, Her own was ever free. Now, lest his Care should Pity move, She shuns his very Sight; And leaves him to that hopeless Love, She did create in Spight. Her Name I could not make him tell, Though vowing him my aid; He said he never would reveal, In Life, nor Death, the Maid. XXVIII THE FEIGNED LOVE Cloris, tho' meaner Beauties might Perhaps have need of some such Slight, You may those petty Arts despise, Secure of what is once your Prize; Ill us'd and scorn'd, we must adore, And question not resistless Power: In Rome, no Man was known to fly, Whom the Emperor condemn'd to dye, The fatal Stroke themselves wou'd give, Rather than banisht from her live. So to your Empire harsh or kind, I stand by my own choice confind. I daily saw how others far'd, Whom the false Hope you gave ensnar'd; Like foolish Boys at Birds, that catch, Sometimes we thought you in our reach; And then again, you'd mount and fly Beyond the compass of our Eye; Till weary'd with the vain Pursuit, Like Birds that peck at painted Fruit, The wiser sort their Hopes disclaim, And beat the Wood for easier Game. XXIX ON THE BIRTH-DAY OF THE LATE QUEEN A SONG Love's Goddess sure was blind this Day, Thus to adorn her greatest Foe, And Love's Artillery betray, To one that wou'd her Realm o'rethrow. Those Eyes, that form that lofty Meen, Who could for Vertue's Camp design? Defensive Arms shou'd there be seen; No sharp, no pointed Weapons shine. Sweetness of Nature, and true Wit, High Power, with equal Goodness joyn'd In this fair Paradise are met, The Joy and Wonder of Mankind. May her blest Example chase Vice in Troops out of the Land, Flying from her awful Face, Like pale Ghosts when Day's at Hand. Long may she Reign over this Isle Lov'd and ador'd in foreign Parts; But gentle Pallas shield the while From her bright Charms our single Hearts. May her Heroe bring home Peace, Won with Honour in the Field, And all home-bred Factions cease; He our Sword, and She our Shield. Many such Days may she behold, Like the glad Sun without decay; May Time, that tears where he lays hold, Only salute her in his way. Late, late, may she to Heaven return, And Quires of Angels there rejoyce, As much as we below shall mourn Our short, but their eternal Choice. XXX TO CLORIS Cloris, I justly am betray'd, By a Design my self had laid; Like an old Rook, whom in his Cheat, A run of Fortune does defeat. I thought at first with a small Sum Of Love, thy Heap to overcome; Presuming on thy want of Art, Thy gentle and unpractis'd Heart; But naked Beauty can prevail, Like open force, when all things fail. Instead of that thou hast all mine, And I have not one Stake of thine; And, like all Winners, dost discover A Willingness to give me over. And though I beg, thou wilt not now; 'Twere better thou should'st do so too; For I so far in debt shall run, Even thee I shall be forc'd to shun. My Hand, alas, is no more mine, Else it had long ago been thine; My Heart I give thee, and we call No Man unjust that parts with all. XXXI THE SOLDIERS CATCH Room, Boys, room; room, Boys; room, For from Ireland we come; We have mawl'd the original Tories; We have baffled the League, Between Monsieur and Teague, And eclips'd the Grand Lewis his Glories. They all fly in the Field, Their best Garrisons yield, They stand trembling while we take their Passes: Our brave King at our Head, We fear no Steel nor Lead, But laugh at their Beads and their Masses. If some Blood we have spilt, To compound for the Guilt, In Love's Camp we will do double Duty, Mankind we will repair, With the leave of the Fair, And pay our Arrears to true Beauty. Our worst Noise in the Pit, Shall pass all for good Wit, While the Cits and the Bumkins adore us. We will pay the Rogues well, Their Wives Bellies shall swell, And the Cuckolds at random shall score us. The next Summer for France, We will boldly advance, Our noble Redeemer shall lead us; We will break the Slaves Chains, And drink of their Champains, To the Health of that Heroe that freed us. He hates Lewis le Grand, Like a true English Man, And ne're will consent to a Treaty, Till each neighbouring Crown Have what's justly their own, And the French strike sail when th[e]y met ye. Since Elizabeth's Reign No Protestant Queen We have had, but the present God bless her; Since our Edward the Fourth, No brave Prince of such Worth, But William his valiant Successor. With a Queen so devout, And a People so stout, A Parliament that will supply 'em, A Cause that is right, And a King that will fight, Our Enemies all we defie 'em. XXXII THE INDIFFERENCE Thanks, fair Vrania; to your Scorn I now am free, as I was born, Of all the Pain that I endur'd By your late Coldness I am cur'd. In losing me, proud Nymph, you lose The humblest Slave your Beauty knows; In losing you, I but thrown down A cruel Tyrant from her Throne. My ranging Love did never find Such Charms of Person and of Mind; Y'ave Beauty, Wit, and all Things know, But where you shou'd your Love bestow. I unawares my Freedom gave, And to those Tyrants grew a Slave; Would you have kept what you had won, You should have more Compassion shewn. Love is a Burthen, which two Hearts, When equally they bear their Parts, With Pleasure carry; but no one, Alas, can bear it long alone. I'm not of those who court their Pain, And make an Idol of Disdain; My Hope in Love does ne're expire, But it extinguishes Desire. Nor yet of those who ill receiv'd, Wou'd have it otherwise believ'd; And, where their Love cou'd not prevail, Take the vain Liberty to rail. Whoe're wou'd make his Victor less, Must his own weak Defence confess, And while her Pow'r he does defame, He poorly doubles his own Shame. Even that Malice does betray, And speak Concern another way; And all such Scorn in Men is but The Smoke of Fires ill put out. He's still in Torment, whom the Rage To Detraction does engage; In Love Indifference is sure The only sign of perfect Cure. XXXIII SONG Who would not gaze away his Heart On Mariana's Eyes, Did not her high and just Disdain The bold Delight chastize? Mirth and Joy she spreads around, Like the Sun's chearful Light, When his returning Beams destroy The Empire of the Night. Her Beauty with amazement strikes (If with no more) the Old: Her Vertue tempers with Despair The Youthful and the Bold. Her Goodness so disarms her Wit Of the offensive part; Whilst others only charm the Ear, She steals the very Heart. Let us no more defame the Fair, But learn to praise again; Bright Mariana's Worth demands A new and nobler Strain. So, to the feather'd Kind, the Spring Restores their wonted Voice; On ev'ry Bough they sit and sing, And court their new-made Choice. XXXIV THE EIGHTH ODE OF THE SECOND BOOK OF HORACE Did any Punishment attend Thy former Perjuries, I should believe a second time, Thy charming Flatteries: Did but one Wrinkle mark this Face, Or hadst thou lost one single Grace. No sooner hast thou, with false Vows, Provok'd the Powers above; But thou art fairer than before, And we are more in love, Thus Heaven and Earth seem to declare, They pardon Falshood in the Fair. Sure 'tis no Crime vainly to swear, By every Power on high, And call our bury'd Mother's Ghost A Witness to the Lye: Heaven at such Perjury connives, And Venus with a Smile forgives. The Nymphs and cruel Cupid too, Sharp'ning his pointed Dart On a old Hone, besmear'd with Blood, Forbear thy perjur'd Heart. Fresh Youth grows up, to wear thy Chains, And the old Slave no Freedom gains. Thee, Mothers for their eldest Sons, Thee, wretched Misers fear, Lest thy prevailing Beauty should Seduce the hopeful Heir: New-marry'd Virgins fear thy Charms Should keep their Bridegroom from their Arms. XXXV A BALLAD To the Tune of Bateman. You Gallants all, that love good Wine, For shame your Lives amend; With Strangers go to Church, or Dine, But drink with an old Friend. For with him tipling all the Night, You kiss, hugg, and embrace; Whereas a Stranger, at first sight, May kill you on the Place. There was a rich old Usurer, A gallant Son he had; Who slew an ancient Barrister, Like a true mettled Lad. All in that very House, where Saint Holds Devil by the Nose; These Drunkards met to Roar, and Rant, But quarrell'd in the close. The Glass flew chearfully about, And drunken Chat went on; Which Troops had fail'd, and which were stout, When Namur wou'd be won. A learned Lawyer, at the last, No Tory, as I'm told, Began to talk of Tyrants past, In Words both sharp and bold. He toucht a little on our Times, Defin'd the Power of Kings, What were their Vertues, what their Crimes, And many dangerous Things. A Stranger that sat silent by, And scarce knew what he meant, O'ercome with Wine and Loyalty, Did thus his Passion vent: I cannot bear the least ill Word, That lessens any King; And the bold Man shall feel my Sword; At that their Friends stept in. The Quarrel seem'd a while compos'd, And many Healths there past, But one to Blood was ill dispos'd, As it appear'd at last. The Counsellor was walking Home, Sober, as he was wont, The young Man after him did come, With Sword, that was not blunt. A Blow there past, which no Man saw, From Cane of Lawyer bold; The young Man did his Weapon draw, And left the Lawyer cold. Which Cane held up, in his Defence, Was judg'd a Weapon drawn: What needs there farther Evidence, Th' Assault was very plain. At Hixes's Hall, by Jury grave, It was Man-slaughter found; O what wou'd it have cost to have A Pardon from the Crown. Then learn, my honest Country-men, To take yourselves the Pence; Wisely prevent the Courtier's Gain, And save us that Expence. Ye Gallants all, take heed how you Come to untimely Ends; Justice has bid the World adieu, And dead Men have no Friends. XXXVI SONG Hears not my Phillis, how the Birds Their feather'd Mates salute? They tell their Passion in their Words; Must I alone be mute? Phillis, without Frown or Smile, Sat and knotted all the while. The God of Love in thy bright Eyes Does like a Tyrant reign; But in thy Heart a Child he lyes, Without his Dart or Flame. Phillis, without [Frown or Smile, Sat and knotted all the while.] So many Months in Silence past, And yet in raging Love, Might well deserve one Word at last My Passion shou'd approve. Phillis, without [Frown or Smile, Sat and knotted all the while.] Must then your faithful Swain expire, And not one Look obtain, Which he, to sooth his fond Desire, Might pleasingly explain? Phillis, without [Frown or Smile, Sat and knotted all the while.] XXXVII ADVICE TO THE OLD BEAUX Scrape no more your harmless Chins, Old Beaux, in hope to please; You shou'd repent your former Sins, Not study their Increase; Young awkard Fops, may shock our Sight, But you offend by Day and Night. In vain the Coachman turns about, And whips the dappl'd Greys; When the old Ogler looks out, We turn away our Face. True Love and Youth will ever charm, But both affected, cannot warm. Summer-fruits we highly prise, They kindly cool the Blood; But Winter-berries we despise, And leave 'em in the Wood; On the Bush they may look well, But gather'd, lose both taste and smell. That you languish, that you dye, Alas, is but too true; Yet tax not us with Cruelty, Who daily pity you. Nature henceforth alone accuse, In vain we grant, if she refuse. XXXVIII SONG When first Pastora came to Town, The fresh Desire of every Heart, Her Innocence so fenc'd her own, She laught at Cupid and his Dart. Her Looks might all the World enflame, Themselves, yet cold as freezing Snow; Which the bold Hand that thinks to tame, Soon with unusual Heat will glow. As when a Comet does appear, We Stars and Moon no more respect; So while Pastora guilds our Sphere, All former Beauties we neglect. XXXIX SONG Smooth was the Water, calm the Air, The Evening-Sun deprest, Lawyers dismist the noisie Bar, The Labourer at rest, When Strephon, with his charming Fair, Cross'd the proud River Thames, And to a Garden did repair, To quench their mutual Flames. The crafty Waiter soon espy'd Youth sparkling in her Eyes; He brought no Ham, nor Neats-tongues dry'd, But Cream and Strawberries. The amorous Strephon ask'd the Maid, What's whiter than this Cream? She blush'd, and could not tell, she said: Thy Teeth, my pretty Lamb. What's redder than these Berries are? I know not, she reply'd: Those lips, which I'll no longer spare, The burning Shepherd cry'd. And strait began to hug her: This Kiss, my Dear, Is sweeter far Than Strawberries, Cream and Sugar. XL SONG The Sun had scarce drunk up the Dew, Or underneath the Boughs, The chearful Birds met, to renew Their mutual daily Vows. Scarce had they paid their Debt to Love, When Thirsis with his Fair, Enter'd in haste the conscious Grove, A lovely loving Pair. Thirsis began, Why mourns, my Dear? Why does my Celia weep, Since all things are propitious here, And envious Man asleep? Blame not my Tears, the Nymph reply'd, Let them for ever flow, E're Phœbus twice his Face shall hide, I to the Country go. Let us then snatch at flying Joy, Cry'd out the am'rous Swain; When cruel Flames an House destroy, Who saves not what he can? If, Thirsis, e're we seal our Love, We are so loth to part, The Torment then will double prove, And break my tender Heart. I suddenly must cross the Seas, To get my self a Name, For in Love's Camp no Man can rise, Who is unknown to Fame. XLI TO THE KING ON HIS BIRTH-DAY Behold the happy Day again, Destinguisht by the Joy in every Face; This Day Great William's Life began, Soul of our War, and Guardian of our Peace. Of three afflicted Realms, the choice, When on the furious Waves of Faction tost, They all cry'd out, as with one Voice, Save us, Heroick Prince, or we are lost. So in the gen'ral Deluge met Beasts of all Kinds, whom Nature had made Foes; They did their mutual Hate forget, And the blest Ark for sacred Refuge chose. Part of thy Time, and of thy Care, Thy Native Country claims, and cannot want. But we one Movement cannot spare, (Tho' it be due) without a kind Complaint. The Sun, who flies around the Earth, Painting the Face of Nature where he shines, Giving to Flowers, and Fruit new Birth, Rip'ning for us rich Spice and noblest Wines, Permits we shou'd his Absence mourn, Tho' for our good, like thee, abroad employ'd, And that we welcome his Return, As if too long by distant Climes enjoy'd. Hail, glorious King, fill all the Mouthes of Fame: Vertue like thine will fiercest Envy tame; And may thy Life, be lasting as thy Name. XLII A DIALOGUE Mars.] Cupid, I hear thou hast improv'd Thy little Art of War; Old Men conceit they may be lov'd, And Cripples win the Fair. False powder'd Beaux at distance kill, And every Fop writes Songs; Musick imploys her utmost Skill, And to thy Camp belongs. Cupid.] Great God of War, why shou'd not I As well as you advance, And by new Ways make Lovers dye, While you bomb Towns in France. William and Louis are your Pride, Belle Dives, and Stowel mine, Whose Batteries Men can less abide Than those upon the Rhine. XLIII OUT OF LYCOPHRON What shall become of Man so wise, When he dies? None can tell Whither he goes to Heaven or Hell; Or after a few Moments dear, He disappear, And at last, Perish entirely like a Beast: But Women, Wine and Mirth we know, Are all the Joys he has below: Let us then ply those Joys we have, 'Tis vain to think beyond the Grave; Out of our reach the Gods have laid Of Time to come th' Event, And laugh to see the Fools afraid, Of what the Knaves invent. XLIV TO LIBER [From Martial, Lib. 8. Ep. 77.] Liber, thou Joy of all thy Friends, Worthy to live in endless Pleasure: While Knaves and Fools pursue their Ends, Let Mirth and Freedom be thy Treasure. Be still well dress'd, as now thou art, Gay, and on charming Objects thinking; Let easie Beauty warm thy Heart, And fill thy Bed when thou leav'st drinking. Delay no pressing Appetite, And sometimes stir up lazy Nature; Of Age the envious Censure slight; What Pleasure's made of, 'tis no matter: He that lives so but to his Prime, Wisely doubles his short Time. XLV SONG Phillis is my only Joy, Faithless as the Winds or Seas; Sometimes coming, sometimes coy, Yet she never fails to please; If with a Frown I am cast down, Phillis smiling, And beguiling, Makes me happier than before. Tho', alas, too late I find, Nothing can her Fancy fix; Yet the Moment she is kind, I forgive her all her Tricks; Which, tho' I see, I can't get free; She deceiving, I believing; What need Lovers wish for more? XLVI TO COSCUS [From Martial,] Lib. 9. Ep. 7[0]. O Times! O Manners! Cicero cry'd out, But 'twas when enrag'd Catilin conspir'd To burn the City, and to cut the Throat Of half the Senate, had his Ruffians hir'd: When Son and Father did the World divide, And Rome for Tyrants, not for Empire fought; When slaughter'd Citizens on either side Cover'd that Earth, her early Valour bought. Of Times and Men, why dost thou now complain? What is it, Coscus, that offends thee, say? Our Laws the License of the Sword restrain; And our Prince wills that his arm'd Troops obey: His Reign, Success, Freedom and Plenty crown, Blame not our Manners then, but mend thy own. XLVII SONG See! Hymen comes; How his Torch blazes! Looser Loves, how dim they burn; No Pleasures equal chaste Embraces, When we Love for Love return. When Fortune makes the Match he rages, And forsakes th' unequal Pair; But when Love two Hearts engages, The kind God is ever there. Regard not then high Blood, nor Riches; You that would his Blessings have, Let untaught Love guide all your Wishes, Hymen shou'd be Cupid's Slave. Young Virgins, that yet bear your Passions, Coldly as the Flint its Fire, Offer to Hymen your Devotions, He will warm you with Desire. Young Men, no more neglect your Duty, To the God of Nuptial Vows: Pay your long, Arrears to Beauty, As his chaster Law allows. XLVIII ON DON ALONZO WHO WAS CUT IN PIECES FOR MAKING LOVE TO THE INFANTA OF PORTUGAL. How cruel was Alonzo's Fate, To fix his Love so high, That he must perish by her Hate, Or by her Kindness dye? Tortur'd, and mangl'd, cut and maim'd, If he triumpht o're his Pain, And with his dying Breath proclaim'd, 'Twas better than Disdain. The gentle Nymph, long since design'd For the proud Monsieur's Bed, Now to a holy Jayl confin'd, Drops Tears with ev'ry Bead. Tell me, ye Gods, if where a King Suffers for Impotence, True Love be such a fatal thing, What can be Innocence? XLIX SONG Phillis, Men say that all my Vows Are to thy Fortune paid; Alas, my Heart he little knows Who thinks my Love a Trade. Were I, of all these Woods, the Lord, One Berry from thy Hand More real Pleasure would afford, Than all my large Command. My humble Love has learnt to live, On what the nicest Maid, Without a conscious Blush, may give Beneath the Myrtle-shade. L ON A COCK AT ROCHESTER Thou cursed Cock, with thy perpetual Noise, May'st thou be Capon made, and lose thy Voice, Or on a Dunghil may'st thou spend thy Blood, And Vermin prey upon thy craven Brood; May Rivals tread thy Hens before thy Face, Then with redoubled Courage give thee chase; May'st thou be punish'd for St. Peter's Crime, And on Shrove-tuesday, perish in thy Prime; May thy bruis'd Carcass be some Beggar's Feast, Thou first and worst Disturber of Man's Rest. LI SONG A-LA-MODE O're the Desert, cross the Meadows, Hunters blew the merry Horn; Phœbus chas'd the flying Shadows: Eccho, she reply'd, in scorn; Still adoring, And deploring: Why must Thirsis lose his Life? Rivers murmur'd from their Fountains, Acrons dropping from the Oaks, Fawns came tripping o're the Mountains, Fishes bit the naked Hook[s]; Still admiring, And desiring: When shall Phillis be a Wife? LII OUT OF FRENCH Dear Friend, I fear my Heart will break; In t'other World I scarce believe, In this I little pleasure take: That my whole Grief thou may'st conceive; Cou'd not I Drink more than I Whore, By Heaven, I wou'd not live an Hour. LIII THE DOCTOR AND HIS PATIENTS There was a prudent grave Physician, Careful of Patients as you'd wish one; Much good he did with Purge and Glister, And well he knew to raise a Blister; Many he cur'd and more he wou'd, By Vomit, Flux, and letting Blood; But still his Patients came again, And most of their old Ills complain; The Drunkards drank, and spoild their Liver: Beaux ply'd the Smock as much as ever, And got the high Veneral Feaver: The Glutton cram'd at Noon and Supper, And doubled both his Paunch and Crupper. One Day he call'd 'em all together, And one by one, he askt 'em whether It were not better by good Diet, To keep their Blood and Humours quiet; With Tost and Ale to cool their Brains, Than nightly Fire 'em with Champains; To sup sometimes on Water-grewel, Than drink themselves into a Duel; To change their lewd, for sober Life, And rotten Whore, for sounder Wife? They all agreed that his Advice Was honest, wholsom, grave and wise; But not one Man, wou'd quit his Vice; For after all his vain Attacks, They rose and din'd well at Pontack's: The Moral The Wise may preach, and Satyrists rail, Custom and Nature will prevail. LIV UPON THE AUTHOR OF THE SATYR AGAINST WIT A Grave Physician, us'd to write for Fees, And spoil no Paper, but with Recipe's, Is now turn'd Poet, rails against all Wit, Except that Little found among the Great; As if he thought true Wit and Sence were ty'd To Men in Place, like Avarice, or Pride. But in their Praise, so like a Quack he talks, You'd swear he wanted for his Christmas-box. With mangled Names old Stories he pollutes, And to the present Time past Actions suits; Amaz'd we find, in ev'ry Page he writes, Members of Parliament with Arthur's Knights[.] It is a common Pastime to Write Ill; And Doctor, with the rest, e'en take thy fill; Thy Satyr's harmless: 'Tis thy Prose that kills, When thou Prescrib'st thy Potions and thy Pills[.] Go on brave Doctor, a third Volume write, And find us Paper while you make us S?. LV PROLOGUE Since glorious Dryden has withdrawn his Light, Some glimmering Stars relieve our gloomy Night; Poets of different Magnitudes advance, In humble Confidence of Song and Dance; Ballon and Tumblers please, tho' Poets fail; At a strong Back She-Criticks never rail. When a good Place is void, we all pretend, Some on their Merit, some their Purse [dep]end: Our Friend can boast of neither, yet his Play He hopes at least may live out his third Day; Adorn him with one Sprig, like Christmas-Brawn, His farther Plea to Bays shall be withdrawn. In Courts of Law, under Delays we groan, But here our Poets are too sone undone; Plays are half seen, half heard, less understood, When the dead Warrant issues from the Crowd; Some are so void of Wit they'll relish none: Others again like nothing but their own; Tho' outwardly they seem to carry it fair, The Wits are alwayes in a state of War. This Play's so chast, so void of Pagan Wit, It might have been by a Reformer writ; Fops, Beauxs and Parsons, shall this Night be safe, We bring the other Sex to make you laugh. LVI PROLOGUE [TO EPSOM WELLS] Poets and thieves can scarce be rooted out, Scape ne're so hardly, they'll have th'other bout; Burnt in the hand the Thieves fall to't agen, And Poets hist, cry they did so to Ben— Like Boys, who have at School too oft been stript, They have no feeling in the part that's whipt. They're for your pity, not your anger, fit, They're e'en such fools, they wou'd be thought t'have wit. Elsewhere you all can flatter, why not here; You'll say you pay, and so can be severe: Judge for yourselves then Gallants as you pay, And lead not each of you his Bench astray: Let easie Citts be pleased with all they hear, Go home and to their neighbours praise our Ware. They with good stomachs come, and fain wou'd eat You nothing like, and make them loath their meat; Though some men are with Wine, Wit, Beauty cloy'd; The Creatures are by others still enjoy'd. 'Tis not fair play, that one for his Half Crown Shou'd judge, and rail, and damn for half the Town. But do your worst; if once the Pit grows thin, Your dear lov'd Masks, will hardly venture in. Then w'are reveng'd on you, who needs must come Hither, to shun your own dull selves at home: But you kind Burgers who had never yet, Either your Heads or Bellies full of wit: Our Poet hopes to please; but not too well; Nor wou'd he have the angry Criticks swell. A moderate Fate best fits his humble mind, Be neither they too sharp, nor you too kind. LVII PROLOGUE [TO THE STROULERS] Beauty and Wit so barely you requite That had not Nature joyn'd a dear Delight, No Maid wou'd ever Yield, or Poet write[.] Yet sometimes Beauty's Lottery sounds a Prize, And in Alcove the happy Harlot lyes, While but one Wit can to a Laureat rise[;] And then a Butt of Sack, and a small Pension, Is the full summ of his whole Li[f]e's Pretention. If not stark mad, they'll leave us in the Lurch, We have but one poor Living in our Church. Hither you come resolving not to like, And bold-blind Cocks at every Feather strike: The Language one, another Damns the Plot, And briskly hits the Poet, ere he Blot. And pray be Civil my Young Empty Beaux, M[e]re Shew yourselves and only Judge of Shows! Unbend your Critic Brows, For a Young Wench As soon may like a Judge upon the Bench, As one of your Censorious Grimaces, Let Wit alone and trust to your sweet Faces. No Man or Woman here expects that you Should Judge or Write, beyond a Billet Doux; But if you can, pass by each small Offence, And strain your Wits to find one Excellence, Tis much the truest, and best sign of Sense. LVIII PROLOGUE TO THE WARY WIDDOW OR SIR NOISY PARRAT Envy and Faction rule this Grumbling Age, The State they cannot, but they shake the Stage, This barren trade some woud engross, still hopeing From our poor Port to banish Interloping: And like the plodding Lawyers take great care To elbow blooming merit, from the Bar: In every Age there were a sort of Men, As you do now, damn'd all was written then. Thousands before 'em less provok'd their Pride Then one poor rivall straining by their side, Such vermin Critticks we expect to find, For Nature knows not how to loose a kind The stinking Poll Cat, nor the Mole that's Blind. But against old as well as new to rage, Is the peculiar Phrensy of this Age. Shackspear must down, and you must praise no more Soft Desdemona, nor the Jealous Moor: Shackspear whose fruitfull Genius, happy Wit Was fram'd and finisht at a lucky hit The Pride of Nature, and the shame of Schools, Born to Create, and not to learn from Rules; Must please no more, his Bastards now deride Their Fathers Nakedness they ought to hide, But when on Spurs their Pegasus they force, Their faded Muse is distanc'd in the Course: All that is now has been before tis true, And yet the Art, the Fashion may be new: Tho' old Materials the large Pallace raise, The skillfull Architect deserves his praise. If nothing please, you are not nice, but sick, 'Tis want of stomack, ever to dislike. On our Past Poets, petty Juries sit, The Living sink beneath your present spite, As if this were the doomsday of all wit. But Beaus and Ladies for your selves be wise You'l break our Lottery if none draw a Prize[.] For this one night, do as kind Lovers use[,] Tye up strict Judgement and let fancy loose. EPIGRAMS: OR, COURT CHARACTERS Carmina vix placeant Romæ si displicet Author; Docta premit Livor, stulta favore vigent. LIX TO MAXIMINA [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. 41 Ovid, who bid the Ladies laugh, Spoke only to the Young and Fair; For Thee his Council were not safe, Who of sound Teeth has[t] scarce a Pair; If thou thy Glass, or Me believe, Shun Mirth, as Foplings do the Wind; At Durfey's Farce affect to grieve; And let thy Eyes alone be kind. Speak not, tho't were to give Consent; For he that sees those rotten Bones, Will dread the[ir] monumental Scent, And fly thy Sigh's like dying Groans. If thou art wise, see dismal Plays, And to sad Stories lend thy Ear; With the afflicted, spend thy Days, And laugh not above once a Year. LX TO SEXTUS [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. 55. I Offer Love, but thou Respect wilt have; Take, Sextus, all thy Pride and Folly crave; But know, I can be no Man's Friend and Slave. LXI TO NYSUS How shall we please this Age? If in a Song We put above six Lines, they count it long; If we contract it to an Epigram, As deep the dwarfish Poetry they damn; If we write Plays, few see above an Act, And those lewd Masks, or noisie Fops distract: Let us write Satyr then, and at our ease Vex th' ill-natur'd Fools we cannot please. LXII TO CLASSICUS [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. 69. When thou art ask'd to Sup abroad, Thou swear'st thou hast but newly din'd; That eating late does overload The Stomach, and oppress the Mind: But if Appicius make a Treat, The slend'rest Summons thou obey'st, No Child is greedier of the Teat, Then thou art of the bounteous Feast. There thou wilt drink till every Star Be swallow'd by the rising Sun: Such Charms hath Wine we pay not for, And Mirth, at others Charge begun. Who shuns his Club, yet flies to ev'ry Treat Does not a Supper, but a Reck'ning hate. LXIII TO SEXTUS [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. 38. What Business, or what Hope brings thee to Town, Who can'st not Pimp, nor Cheat, nor Swear, nor Lye? This Place will nourish no such idle Drone; Hence, in remoter Parts thy Fortune try. But thou hast Courage, Honesty, and Wit, And one, or all these three, will give Thee Bread: The Malice of this Town thou know'st not yet; Wit is a good Diversion, but base Trade; Cowards will, for thy Courage, call thee Bully, Till all, like Thraso's, thy Acquaintance shun; Rogues call thee for thy Honesty a Cully; Yet this is all thou hast to live upon: Friend, three such Vertues, Audley had undone; Be wise, and e're th'art in a Jayl, be gone, Of all that starving Crew we saw to Day None but has kill'd his Man, or writ his Play. LXIV TO POSTHUMUS [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. 12. That thou dost Cashoo breath, and Foreign Gums, Enough to put thy Mistress into Fits; Tho' Rome thy Hair, and Spain thy Gloves perfumes, Few like, but all suspect, those borrow'd Sweets: The Gifts of various Nature come and go, He that smells always, well does never so. LXV TO SCÆVA [From Martial, Lib. 1. Ep. 54.] If Scæva for more Friends thou care, Which thy great Merit cannot want; For me an humble Place prepare, That I am new, make no complaint, Thy dearest Friends were Strangers once, like me, Like them, in time, I an old Friend may be, If thou no want of friendly Vertues see. LXVI TO SERTORIUS If thou do'st want a Horse, thou buy'st a Score, Or if a Piece of Wine, thou'lt have a Tun; Swords, Belts, or Hats, does any Cheat bring o're; At his own Rate thou wilt have all or none. Whil'st out of Wantonness thou buy'st so fast, Out of meer Want thou wilt sell all at last. LXVII TO CLOE [From Martial, Lib. 3. Ep. 42.] Leave off thy Paint, Perfumes, and youthful Dress, And Nature's failing Honesty confess; Double we see those Faults which Art wou'd mend, Plain downright Ugliness wou'd less offend. LXVIII TO CANIDIUS Thou strutst, as if thou wert the only Lord; When we all know of such there is an House, Where I might sit, cou'd I the Price afford, And Child has now three Earldoms out at use, High Expectation does attend good Seed, Yet none will buy a known Jade, for his Breed; Boast not too much thy mighty Pedigree, Were they alive, they'd be asham'd of Thee. LXIX TO SEPTIMUS Thro' servile Flattery thou dost all commend: Who cares to please, where no Man can offend? LXX TO FLAVIUS Thou quiblest well, hast Craft and Industry, Flatt'rest great Men, laugh'st at their Enemies, Rally'st the absent, art a pretty Spy, Yet for all this in Court thou dost not rise; Thou play'st thy Court-game booty: I'm affraid Th'ast promis'd Marriage, when thy Fortune's made, And so thou dar'st not thrive upon thy Trade. LXXI TO CANDIDUS [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. 43. All Things are common amongst Friends, thou say'st; This is thy Morning and thy Ev'ning-song, Thou in rich Point, and Indian-Silk art dress'd Six foreign Steeds to thy Calash belong, Whil'st by my Cloaths the Ragman scarce wou'd gain; And an uneasie Hackny jolts my Sides; A Cloak embroider'd intercepts thy Rain, A worsted Camblet my torn Breeches hides; Turbots and Mullets thy large Dishes hold, In mine a solitary Whiting lies; Thy Train might Fire the impotent and old, Whil'st my poor Hand a Ganimede supplies: For an old wanting Friend thou'lt nothing do, Ye[t] all is common among Friends we know; Nothing so common, as to use 'em so. LXXII TO GAURUS [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. 89. That thou dost shorten thy long Nights with Wine, We all forgive thee, for so Cato did; That thou writ'st Poems without one good Line, Tully's Example may that Weakness hide; Thou art a Cuckold, so great Cæsar was; Eat'st till thou spew'st, Antonius did the same; That thou lov'st Whores, Jove loves a bucksom Lass; But that th'art whipt, is thy peculiar Shame. LXXIII TO THRASO Whil'st thou sit'st drinking up thy Loyalty, And rail'st at Laws, thou dost not understand, Ador'st the Ministers, who know not [thee], Sel'st thy long Freedom for a short Command, The Power thou aim'st at, if o're thee one have, In a rich Coat th'art but a ranting Slave. LXXIV ON COSCUS [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. 77. Coscus, thou say'st my Epigrams are long; I'd take thy Judgment on a Pot of Ale: So thou may'st say the Elephant's too strong, A Dwarf too short, the Pyramid too tall; Things are not long, where we can nothing spare; But, Coscus, even thy Disticks tedious are. LXXV TO BITHINICUS [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. [26]. That thy Wife coughs all Night, and spits all Day; Already thou believ'st thy Fortune made, Her whole Estate thou think'st thy suddain Prey; She will not dye, but wheedles like a Jade. LXXVI TO MAXIMUS [From Martial,] Lib. 2. Ep. 53. Wou'd'st thou be free, I fear thou art in jest; But if thou wou'd'st, this is the only Way, Be no Man's Tavern, nor Domestick Guest; Drink wholsom Wine, which thy own Servants draw; Of knavish Curio, scorn the ill-got Plate, The numerous Servants, and the cringing Throng: With a few Friends on fewer Dishes eat, And let thy Cloaths, like mine, be plain and strong; Such Friendships make, as thou may'st keep with ease, Great Men expect, what good Men hate to pay; Be never thou thy self in pain to please, But leave to Fools, and Knaves, th' uncertain Prey. Let thy Expence with thy Estate keep pace; Meddle with no Man's Business, scarce thy own; Contented pay for a Plebeian Face, And leave vain Fops the Beauties of the Town. If to this Pitch of Vertue thou can'st bring Thy Mind, th'art freer than the Persian King. LXXVII TO JULIUS Thou swear'st thou'lt drink no more; kind Heaven send Me such a Cook or Coach-man, but no Friend. LXXVIII TO FLAVIA When to thy Husband thou didst first refuse The lawful Pleasures of thy charming Bed; Men did his Pipe, and Pot, and Whores accuse; On his meer Lewdness the whole Fault we laid: Into thy House thou took'st a deep Divine, And all thy Neighbours flockt to hear him Preach; The cheated World did in thy Praises joyn, The wiser sort yet knew thy wanton Reach, From Sundays-crowds thou did'st thy Gallants chuse, And, when they fail'd thee, the good Doctor use. LXXIX TO SERGIUS Thou'lt fight, if any Man call Thebe Whore: That she is thine, what can proclaim it more. LXXX THE MAIDENHEAD [From Martial, Lib. 1. Ep. 58.] Cloris, the prettyest Girl about the Town, Askt fifty Guineas, for her Maidenhead; I laught, but Cascus paid the Money down, And the young Wench did to his Chamber lead. This Thrift my eager Catso did upbraid, And wisht that he had grown 'twixt Cascus Thighs; Get me but half what his got him, I said, And to content thee, I'll ne'er stick at Price. LXXXI TO QUINTUS Thou art an Atheist, Quintus, and a Wit, Thinkst all was of self-moving Attoms made, Religion only for the Vulgar fit, Priests Rogues, and Preaching their deceitful Trade; Wilt drink, whore, fight, blaspheme, damn, curse and swear: Why wilt thou swear, by G?, if there be none? And if there be, thou shou'd'st his Vengeance fear: Methinks this Huffing might be let alone; 'Tis thou art free, Mankind besides a Slave, And yet a Whore may lead the[e] by the Nose, A drunken Bottle, and a flatt'ring Knave, A mighty Prince, Slave to thy dear Soul's Foes, Thy Lust, thy Rage, Ambition and thy Pride; He that serves G?, need nothing serve beside. LXXXII ON ARRIA AND PŒTUS [From Martial, Lib. 1. Ep. 13.] When Arria to her Pœtus gave the Steel, Which from her bleeding Side did newly part; From my own Wound, she said, no Pain I feel: And yet thy Wound will stab me to the Heart. LXXXIII TO MILO [From Martial, Lib. 2. Ep. 64.] One Month a Lawyer, thou the next wilt be A grave Physician, and the third a Priest; Chuse quickly one Profession of the three; Marry'd to her, thou yet may'st court the rest. Whil'st thou stand'st doubting, Bradbury has got Five Thousand Pound, and Conquest as much more; W? is made B?, from a drunken Sot: Leap in, and stand not shiv'ring on the Shore; On any one amiss thou can'st not fall, Thou'lt end in nothing, if thou grasp'st at all. LXXXIV TO SABINUS Surly and Sour thou dislik'st Mankind; But most thou hat'st the Company thou'rt in; Seest all their Faults, but to thy own art blind: Yet still thou cry'st, When shall we meet agen? Thou can'st not sit at Home, what should'st thou read? For all are Fools, thou know'st that ever writ. What should'st thou do abroad? this Age does breed A sort of Vermin, have not half their Wit. Thou hat'st the World, hate Flesh and Devil so, And, for a blessed End, to Burnet's go; But, for thy Misery, th'art an Atheist too. LXXXV ON PHRINE Phrine, as odious as Youth well can be, The Daughter of a Courtier in high Place, Met with a b? Mass, that cou'd not see; His Blindness she, and that excus'd her Face. Were she not ugly, she wou'd him despise; Nor wou'd he marry her, if he had Eyes. To their Defects, they're for the Match in debt, And, but for Faults on both sides, ne're had met. LXXXVI TO BASSA [From Martial, Lib. 1. Ep. 90.] That I ne're saw thee in a Coach with Man, Nor thy chast Name in wanton Satyr met; That from thy Sex thy liking never ran, So as to suffer a Male-servant yet. I thought thee the Lucretia of our time: But, Bassa, thou the while a Tribas wert, And clashing ?, with a prodigious Crime, Didst act of Man th'inimitable part. What Odipus this Riddle can untye? Without a Male, there was Adultery. LXXXVII TO SCILLA Storm not, brave Friend, that thou hadst never yet Mistress nor Wife that others did not ?, But, like a Christian, pardon and forget, For thy own Pox will thy Revenge contrive. LXXXVIII ON SEXTUS [From Martial, Lib. 2. Ep. 44.] When I had purchast a fresh Whore or Coat, For which I knew not how to pay, Sextus, that wretched covetous old Sot, My ancient Friend, as he will say; Lest I shou'd borrow of him, took great care, And mutter'd to himself aloud, So as he knew I cou'd not chuse but hear How much he to Secundas ow'd, And twice as much he paid for Interest, Nor had one Farthing in his trusty Chest: If I had ask'd, I knew he wou'd not lend; 'Tis new, before-hand, to deny a Friend. LXXXIX THE HAPPY PAIR: OR, A POEM ON MATRIMONY. When first the World from the black Chaos rose, And Infant-Beauty did the Frame compose; When Heav'n and Man possess'd one state of Mind, And the pure Globe, like its CREATOR, shin'd: When free from Sin the noble Mortal strove To Rival God in his return of Love. When damning PRIDE, that Architect of Hell, Made not, as yet, his Tempted Soul Rebel. When plunging Avarice no Birth had found, Nor tore the precious Entrails of the Ground; Then then the new Inhabitant was blest, Ease watch'd his Heart, and Peace secur'd his Breast; No Earthy Thought tainted his gen'rous Mind, That World th' Almighty gave him, he declin'd; His God-like Image made him upwards move; He liv'd below while his Soul dwelt above. Riches were things too weak t' enslave his Sense, The Daz'ling Di'mond wanted Influence. Pearls, like the Common Gravel, he contemn'd, And what we count a God, he thought no Friend. With heat of Love he flam'd upon his Mate, And on the green Swarth without dowry sate: Circling her snowy Neck, he sought her Heart; A fi'ry Lover, free from Fraud, or Art. The Object of his restless Thoughts, was Bliss, And that he found in one Embrace, one Kiss: One Clasp, one Hugg, one eager Glance was more, Than Worlds of Pearl, or heaps of Golden Ore. He prais'd his priz'd Affection next his God, And thought his Wife the second Chiefest Good; The Heav'n-born Dame brought to his longing Arms Her Soul, her Beauty, and resistless Charms. Her Breast an equal active Fire did move, She lost the thoughts of Empire in his Love. The splendid stile of Empress she despis'd, The World a Cypher to the Man she priz'd: Her crouding Wishes him alone persu'd, No sep'rate Greatness cou'd her Love delude: Her Intellectuals pure, knew how to scan That Great and Independent Monarch, Man; That little, but more weighty World Refin'd, More apt, and suited to her Heav'nly Mind. She understood, that all that Good we name, Was nicely wrapt and folded up in him. Oh Fate! from whence proceeds the hidden Cause, That we at LOVE, that glorious Passion, pause! Was it with Adam's Innocence betray'd, Or, by his Lapse, a Malefactor made? Or have our own acquir'd Excesses been So daring, to determin it a Sin? What shou'd at once proclaim us Blest and Great, We fly, and court the Land-mark of our Fate. Like murm'ring full-mouth'd Isra'lites we stand, And run on Rocks, to shun the Holy Land. From hence the baffl'd World has been inverst, Princes involv'd in War, and People Curst; Friends to their Confidents Estrang'd, and those Whom Fathers Got, to tender Fathers Foes. Hence Lands United to themselves, divide, And cease their strict Alliance, tho' Ally'd. Hence hot debates grow in Domestick Pow'rs, The Man's unkind, the cheated Woman Low'rs. Man, like the sordid Earth, from which he sprung, Corrupts his Soul by a base heap of Dung: Forgetting the Celestial Form he bore, He values not the Woman, but her Store: Extends his treach'rous Pledge to golden Charms, And joins his hands to none but spangled Arms. He Weds her Jewels, and her Amber-Chains But her Rich Self (that merits all) Disdains: Her Face he praises, but he courts her Ears, Catching the glitt'ring Pendants that she wears: Each Eye no longer he esteem's a Star, Than flaming Rubies h[u]ng upon her Hair: And judging Love, without her Gold, a Curse, He scorns her Vertue, and adores her Purse. The Woman too no less Debas'd than he, Gives not her self, but for GRATUITY; Sooth's like a Merchant, with inveagling Art, Demands her JOINTURE, and keeps back her Heart. On Terms and Articles, with Pride proceeds, And Seals her cold Affections to her Deeds: Stands off and Treat's like an Imperious State, And baulks her Happiness, to be made Great: Proclaims her Fortune of a goodly Size, And he that offers most, obtains the Prize. Both Sexes now deprave their Noble Kind, While sordid Avarice corrupts the Mind. Never consult poor Vertue when they choose. But for a painted Cloud, the Goddess lose. Divine content they count a finer Cheat, A Dish for Ornament, but no true Meat: A meer Romance, an idle Dream of those, Who wanting Wealth, think to disguise their Woes. A Mountebank, that only boasts of Cures; But cannot work th' Effects his Cant assures The vain deluded Atheist thus denies A Supreme Essence, hid from Human Eyes: Because his Sense can't apprehend a God, Religion's Sottish and her Zealots Mad. But look, a Marry'd and a happy PAIR, Are now like Revelations, Strange and Rare: But if we reason from the Ages gone, There scarcely was a happy Match, but One. We mind not now the Merits of our Kind, Curious in Gold, but to the Persons Blind. The Man ne'er minds his Love, for Money still Is the base thirsted Object of his Will. Upon condition of a promis'd Store, He'll hugg a thing that crawls upon all Four. Bring him an Old Rich Corps with grim Death's Head, He'll Swear she's Young, and her Complexion Red. Or if you cou'd bring one without a Face, He'll praise her conq'ring Eyes, and charming Grace. The Woman too, by such Affections led, Contemns the Living, to embrace the Dead. And rather than not Covet, basely bold, Would wed a Coffin, were the Hinges Gold. Nature's Apostate, active Youth she Scorns, Will long for Oxen, if you gild their Horns. Say he's Deform'd, has neither Eyes nor Nose, Nay, nothing to bespeak him Man, but Cloaths, Strait she reply's he's Rich, so passes down; There's nothing ugly, but a poor Baboon. Thus might she clasp a loathsom Toad in Bed, Because he bears a Pearl within his Head. And gilded Pills, tho' bitter, may delight The liquerish Lust of wav'ring Appetite. But still tho' Wealth their griping Senses Feasts, At most, they're but concatenated Beasts. For as they scorn all consonance of Soul, A mutual Hatred must their Peace control. And this stands fix'd, what with my Love won't suit, Appears Deform'd, and strait commences Bruit. To various Climes of Tempers each are thrown, The Frigid coupled to the Torrid Zone; Like Curs of different Nature, in a Chain, They're link'd in Fear, and wear their Bonds in Pain. Perhaps a cold Respect they both may shew, As Impious Men to a kind Demon do. Who when some skulking Wealth he does unfold, Honour and dread him for their New-found Gold. But view, unrobe the bosom of Disguise, Observe the strange aversion of their Eyes: With palpitations of Regret They Twine, Like Oil and Water their false Loves combine. With feign'd Embrace they seem Love's Joys to crave, But with their Bed, converted to a Grave: And whilst their backward Hearts like Load-stones meet, They wish their Linnen were their Winding-sheet. He, like the Bear of Love, her Body Clips, Instead of pressing, bites her glowing Lips. She, like a wounded Otter, flings and Rails, Fires with her Tongue, and combats with her Nails. Hell and Confusion seize the Place around, Nothing but mutual Frenzy's to be found. They both launch out into a Sea of Strife, A clam'rous Husband, and a brawling Wife. The whole Armado of their Thoughts combine, On each side Summon'd, they in Consort join. He arms Revenge, she meets him with Disdain, And to't they rush, like Storms upon the Main. She to her shrill loud Clamours, takes recourse, Stamps, and invokes the Clergy for Divorce; Detests the Light by which his Face she saw, Curses the Bands, and Execrates the Law. Directs to Heav'n her folded Hands with Pray'rs, And pouring down a flood of briny Tears; Hopes that kind Justice wou'd her grief behold, Pity an injur'd Lover, tho' a Scold: That Death wou'd snatch him from the loathsom Bed, And Heav'n restore the Will which she betray'd, He with Distraction and with Rage grows blind, Curses the Sex, and Damns all Woman-kind: Accuses Heav'n that such a Monster made, A Fury in deceitful Masquerade. A gaudy Phantom, that deludes the Sight, A Devil with the Coverture of Light; Blasphemes, and by his Passion cast so far, Destroys himself by Persecuting her: Abjures his Faith sworn to a legal Bed, Hates her, and lays another by his Side; Profusely lavishes, her Right, each Kiss, And wracks her with the sight of wrongful Bliss. She grows provok'd upon the dismal Change, And turns Dishonest, to retort Revenge: The breach of Chastity she makes her Play, Plagues him all Night, and Cuckolds him all Day. This must be then the issue, where our Love, Does not together with our Nuptials move. Possessions can't for fickle Joy provide. When Love the end of Living, is Destroy'd. Alas! we're all mistaken in the Kind, A happy Man is measur'd by the Mind. Suppose him born to all the Pomp of Life; Admit he's match'd to Beauty in a Wife, These are but Pageants, which a while may please, They may Divert him, but procure no Ease. That Grandeur is no compound of our Bliss, The rugged Bosoms of the Great confess. The gilded Monarch's Sable stands within, His Glory to his Troubles, but a Shrine: His Cares, his Jealousies, Nocturnal Frights, Imbitter all his Joys and false Delights. His toiling Head with Grief a Crown must bear, Whilst he still starts and grasps, to hold it there. And thus all Princes to this Hell we trace, They Reign without, and are but Kings by Place. But lest ambitious Maids in Scorn relate, This is the utmost Tyranny of Fate; That such Seditious disagreeing Pairs, Are scarcely known in Centuries of Years. We'll grant, (which yet no less Misfortune breeds) The Woman loves the Golden Man she Weds. We'll think she brings with her Estate a Mind, Pure as her Sterling, from it's Dross Refin'd. Yet this is so unlikely to succeed, It Murders what it first design'd to Feed. He strait concludes her Passion a Pretence, Condemns her Soul, and lays the Crime on Sense. Argues, she only chose to be his Bride, To serve and gratify her costly Pride. But still we'll give this Topick larger Law, We'll say an equal Passion both does draw. We will suppose them both enclin'd to Love. We'll call her Venus, and we'll stile him Jove; Yet through the Tides of Business in his Head, He must neglect, and at length slight her Bed. His peeping Passion, like a feeble Sun, Mingled with Show'rs of Rain, will soon be gone. And if perhaps there's left some poor Remains, Like Northern Gold, 'tis in penurious Veins. Diffus'd and scatter'd o'er the barren Land, Amidst vast heaps of Lead and worthless Sand. This must be then a sad Reward of Love, When he thus senseless of her Choice do's prove. Her Am'rous Courage ne'er can long be bold, That finds herself out-rival'd by her Gold. Both their Affections to the Deep are sent, He sinks through Weight, and she through Discontent. Their Riches then shew their defect of Pow'r, That can't create what Want do's oft procure. In thought of Wealth, he can't Intomb his Smart, When sullen Love preys on his stubborn Heart. If crouded Chests and glutted Coffers can Restore Contentment to the anxious Man; Possess'd of those, if he from Pain is free, A troubled, may be call'd a quiet Sea: Because there's Pearl and Amber on the Shoars, And thus it's strangely Silenc'd when it Roars. But 'twere, methinks, an easie Task to prove There's no such Curse, as Mercenary Love; True Fire the Hearts oth' Wealthy seldom breed, They may through Care, but not Affection bleed. Their Tenures, Lands, their Rents, and Quarter-days, In their Distracted Heads strong Factions raise. And whensoe'er poor simpering Love peeps in, He's by that boistrous Crowd beat out agen: Crœsus is still perplex'd to guard his Store; Fears 'twill be less, labours to make it more. Thus what he hoard's by the excess of Gain, Starves his lean Joy, but feeds his pamper'd Pain. When Love with kind Caresses he should please, He forms Indentures, draws a cautious Lease; On nasty Acres all his Speeches run, His Heart's a Tumult, like a Market-Town. And when in Bed he shou'd Embrace his Spouse, Like a Dull Ox, he's still amongst the Cows; Chew's all the Night upon the next fair Day, How much this Horse, how much that Load of Hay. No thought but that of Cattle, yoaks his Heart, His Soul's the Driver, and himself the Cart. Nothing but Buz and Noise, his Fancy seize, His Head's the Hive, his busie Thoughts the Bees. In vain the Wife do's for the Husband Mourn, Whilst she's the Burthen, and her Love the Droan. Love, like a cautious fearful Bird, ne'er builds, But where the Place Silence and Calmness yields: He slily flies to Copses, where he finds The snugging Woods secure from Blasts and Winds. Shuns the huge Boughs of a more stately Form, And Laughs at Trees tore up with ev'ry Storm. The pleasant Nightingale can ne'er be won, To quit a Temp'rate Shade, to scorch i'th' Sun; In some low Grove, he sings his Charming Note[,] And on a Thorn tunes the sweet Warbling Throat. We'll take a Rustick Couple for our Scenes, Who Love, and know not what Ambition means: Who such an even competence possess, What may support, but not disturb their Bliss. See how unmov'd they at all Changes stand, Shipwrecks at Sea, and Earthquakes on the Land: The Fraud of Courts, the Knavish Toil of Clowns, A Monarch's Favour, or his pointed Frowns, Concern them not; they but themselves abuse, In valuing that they ne'er intend to use. Each to the other proves a solid Bliss, Rich in themselves no want of Happiness. Like Ægypt, in whose Land all Plenty grows, Each others Bottom is their best Repose. When clam'rous Storms, and pitchy Tempests rise, Cheek clings to Cheek, and swimming Eyes to Eyes: When jarring Winds and dreadful Thundres Roar, It serves to make 'em Press, and Love the more. Immortal Beings thus themselves Cajol, Spurn stinking Sense, and feed upon the Soul. Here let us leave them bathing in pure Joy, Whom envious Man, nor Fate can e'er destroy. Here let 'em live to share all Wealth and Pow'r, As Greatness can't love less, they can't love more. To the Divinest State of things they drive, Like Pilgrim-Angels, on the Earth they live, Kind Nature gave them, Fortune bore no part, Love join'd their Souls, and Heav'n seal'd each Heart. XC THE FOURTH BOOK OF VIRGIL [Translation of the Fourth Georgic.] Next I will sing ethereal Dews refin'd, The heavenly Gift of Honey to Mankind; Let not Mecœnus this small Part despise, Nature is always wonderful and wise; But mind, while I the Laws, Birth, Wars relate, And sing the Leaders of this winged State; The Subjects humble, but not so the Praise, If any Muse assist the Poets Lays, Or invok'd Phœbus his small Labours grace, First for your Bees, a Seat and Station chuse, Shelter'd from Winds, and where no Cattle use; For they in Winds cannot bring home their Food: Nor let the Dew from off the Flowers be trod By Sheep or Goats; let no young Heifer in, With wandring Feet to crush the rising Green; Suffer no greedy Wood-pecker to live, Nor spotted Lizard, near you fruitful Hive; Nor Progne's Race admit, who long since stain'd Her feather'd Bosom, with her bleeding Hand; Lest in their Bills they bear the Swarm away To their devouring Nests a cruel Prey. But let clear Fountains, mossy Pools be near, And a small Brook his murmuring Passage wear Between the grassy Banks; let the Hives be O'ershaded by some Palm or Olive-tree; That when new Kings first lead their Troops abroad, And the glad Youth forsake their dark aboad; They on the neighbouring Banks may shun the Heat, Or find on shady Boughs a cool Retreat. Whether the sluggish Waters make a Pool, Or in weak Streams, with gentle Murmur rowl, Throw in some Boughs and Stones where they may stand, And to the Summer's Sun their Wings expand. If by East Winds, disperst in their short flight, They headlong on the Water's Surface light. Let Cassia's spicy Shrub be ever nigh, With verdant Thyme and fragrant Savory; And near some Fountain, on well water'd Beds, Let early Violets raise their Purple Heads: And let your Hives, whether of Barks of Trees, Or bending Osier have small Passages, Le[s]t Cold condense, or Heat the Honey warm, For both Extreams may equally do harm. Nor is't in vain; so artfully they line Their Cells with Wax, Herbs, Leaves and Flowers joyn, Closing with certain Glue, their Outlets, which For that small use excels Idean Pitch. If Fame say true, sometimes they under Ground Make themselves Nests, sometimes their Swarms are found In the dark Vaults of hollow Pumices, Or in the rotten Trunks of aged Trees. To stop the gaping Crannies of their Hive, Of Leaves and Mud a yielding Paste contrive. Let no dire Yew, her baneful Shadow spread Near their small House; no filthy Crabs grown red In crackling Flames, infect the Neighbouring Air; No odious smell of Mire, no Fen be near. Echo, that babbling Nymph, be far away, And hollow Caves that with last Accents play, When under Ground the Sun makes Winter fly, And with his fruitful Light expands the Sky. They spread o're every Forest and dark Wood, Sip of each Stream, and taste of every Bud: Then back with Vernal Sweets, refresht they come, New build and people their beloved Home. Next in their artful Combs fresh holes they drill, Which with tenacious Honey soon th[e]y fill. When thou look'st up, and seest 'em all above, In a thick Cloud before the Weather move, Through yielding Skies cutting their liquid Way, No more they mean in their own Homes to stay, But fly to the next Water or green Wood, For there they'll swarm, if not by Art withstood. Press then each Herb of grateful smell and taste, Before 'em Mint and Honey-suckles cast. Let Brass and Old Cybile's Cymbals beat, Till to their Medicin'd Hives, they all retreat; But if adventurous Kings for Empire strive, Or civil Wars divide the factious Hive, The Vulgars Hearts thou early maist perceive, Trembling for Rage; and through the buzzing Hive, A broken Noise, like that of Trumpet's sound, Till the hoarse Warlike Call the Camp go round: Then shine their Wings, and each bold Warrior Whets in his Mouth, and shakes his brandisht Spear; About their King and his Pavillion all The Bravest flock, and for th' Battle call. At his Command in the early Spring they fly Out of their Hives, and in the open Sky, Meet in thick living Clouds, headlong they fall; Not faster from a freezing Cloud the Hail, Nor drops the Acorn from the shaken Oak. The Kings their Camp and Squadrons overlook, Distinguisht by illustrious Wings they go, And mighty Courage in small Bodies show So brave to fly no King was ever found Till half his Host lay breathless on the Ground, These Tempests of their Mind, this mighty Rage, A little Dust thrown up, will soon asswage: But if both Kings return, the Vanquisht slay; The conquering Monarch let the Swarm obey; One bright with various Spots, shining like Gold (For of the two sorts there are) this best and bold In Looks and Courage, gay with glittering Scales; Deform'd with Sloth, the other poorly trails A gross inglorious Paunch; as of the Kings, Their Nations, Shape, are different, and their Wings; Those foul and russet, like the Dust appear, New Spit on by some thirsty Traveller; These are all bright like Lumps of shining Gold, And equal Spots their painted Backs unfold; These are the noblest kind, from such thou maist Sweet Honey press, and of the smoothest taste, Not only sweet and clear, but such as may The roughness of unpleasing Wines allay: But when the Swarms fly wanton in the Air, And to forsake their empty Hives prepare, Thou may'st with ease the Wanderers recall, Clip their King's Wings; the Labour is but small. No great Attempt, if he once lag behind, No airy March, no Flight will be design'd: From various Flowers let grateful Odors rise, And place the Garden's God before their Eyes: Plant Thyme and Pines, from lofty Mountains torn, About their House: Let Hinds, to labour born, Set deep, and water well the fruitful Shade: And now did not my ending Task perswade To slack my Sails, as to my Port I steer, Perhaps the Art of Gardening I'd declare, And rosie Harvests of the Pæstan Year, How their broad Leaves new water'd Endives rear, Green Parsly-beds, slow Daffadils, and how The bending Cucumbers to Belly grow; Nor the Achantus wou'd in silence pass, Y[ew,] Mirtles, nor th' Ivies dire embrace; For I under Tarentums lofty Towers, On yellow Fields, where slow Galasus pours He[r] fruitful Stream, remember to have known A good old Man; some Acres of his own He did possess, but neither fit to breed The useful Heifer, or the Flock to feed, No Purple Vines his naked Elms adorn, But his poor Soil was overgrown with Thorn, Roots he preferr'd, and Pot-herbs of his own. To all the Pomp and Riots of a Crown. When late returning from his Work abroad, He did with unbought Fare his Table load. In the new Spring he cropt the earliest Rose, And the first Apples ripen'd on his Boughs; When even Rocks with cold fierce Winter cleaves, And every Stream his icy Chain receives, He the soft Sprigs of yielding Bearsfoot binds, Chides the late Summer, and slow Western Winds: He first made fruitful Bees his early care, Had many Swarms, whose Combs much Honey bear: As many Blossoms as the Spring display'd, So much ripe Fruit his grateful Autumn paid: He cou'd transplant large Elms and make 'em grow, And to a tastful Plum, improve the Slow: And Plants remove, such as might then afford A grateful Shade to his small chearful Board. To treat those things at large I here want room, And therefore leave 'em to some Muse to come; And now proceed the Natures to declare, Which Jove himself did on the Bees confer As a Reward, for following the shrill Sound of Cybile's Priests on Ida's Hill; Till by their tinkling Cymbals they were led, Where Heaven's new exil'd King th[e]y found and fed. Their off-spring they alone in common rear, And their small City in like Houses share; Under eternal Laws they wisely live, Each knows his little Cell, and loves his Hive; Mindful of Winter, in the Spring takes pains, To swell the publick Stock with private Gains. Some Food provide, and by appointment scour, O'er every Meadow, and each opening Flower. Others at home their industry imploy; Tears of Narcissus, the too lovely Boy, And lightest Gums f[ro]m Barks of Trees they take, The firm Foundation of their Combs to make; Those form the Wax, while these brood o're the young; Others the Cells with liquid Nectar throng; Some watch abroad, and of the Gates take care, Observe Clouds, Rains, and Tempests in the Air; Of the returning Swarm the loads receive, Or force the idle Drones out of the Hive: Hotly the Work is ply'd through all their Cells, Fragrant with Thyme, the new-made Honey smells; And as the Cyclops, when they Thunder mold, Of melting Wedges, some the Bellows hold, Draw in the Winds, and force 'em out again, From the dark Womb of the Bulls nine-fold Skin: Others dip hissing Metals in the Lakes, With their huge massy Anvils Ætna shakes: In tuneful Strokes, their high-rais'd hammers fall: Some turn with nimble Tongs the glowing Ball. So if small things I may with great compare, Cecropian Swarms in their close Work-house fare; Desire of Gains sollicites all Degrees, And makes 'em ply their several Offices; Care of the Town and Combs the Elder take; And with Dædalian Art new Houses make; The Younger late at Night with Labour worn, And laden Thighs, from their days Task return. Among the Wildings, and fat Teils they feed, Pale Violets, and the Osier's bending Reed; All the same Labour, and same Rest partake. Soon as 'tis Day out of their Hives they break; And when th' Evening calls 'em from abroad, Alike refresh themselves with Rest and Food; The House is fill'd with their returning Hum; But when into their inward Rooms they come, A Sacred Silence reigns throughout the Hive, And all with Sleep their wearied Limbs relieve. In threatning Show'rs from Home they will not fly, Nor trust, when East-winds blow, the low'ring Sky, But from their Walls, safe, short Excursions make, And from the near'st Spring their Water take. With little Stones they poise their flight, As reeling Barks by Ballast are kept right. 'Tis strange this sort of Life shou'd please 'em so, Where kindly Joys of Sex they never know; To Venus never sacrifice, nor breed, With glad short Pangs, the Youth that must succeed; But gather from sweet Herbs, and Flowers their young, Choose Kings, and such as to his Court belong; Their little Cells, and Realms of Wax repair; Sometimes on Flints, their labouring Wings they tear: Under their Load, some generously expire, Of Flowers, and Honey, through too great desire. Though their Lives seldom seven Years exceed, Their Kind's immortal, deathless is their Breed: The ancient House and Families survive, And a long faithful Pedigree derive. Not Egypt, Lydia, nor Hidaspis Shore, Their Monarch more obsequiously adore; While he is safe, they all are of one Mind, But if he fail, Faith Laws no longer bind; On their own Stores tumultuously they fall, And of their Combs, destroy themselves the Wall; He keeps them all in order, and in awe. Him they admire, and guard, observe, obey, Oft bear him on their Shoulders through the Air; And a brave Death pursue in Arms and War. Some by these Signs, and these Examples taught, Bees to partake of the eternal Mind have thought, And of Ethereal Race; Jove runs through all, High Heaven, deep Seas, and the Earth's massy Ball; Hence Cattle, Men, all Animals receive When th[e]y are born, the Souls by which they live, And when dissolv'd, to him return, none dye, To their first Elements the grosser fly, Th' etherial Parts ascend their native Sky. But if their little Stores thou car'st to sieze, And force the Sacred Treasure of thy Bees, First from thy Mouth large draughts of Water spout, Then, with thy Hand extended, smoak 'em out. Twice they have Young, two Harvests in a Year, One when the lovely Pleiades appear, And their new Light above the Ocean show; The other when those Stars feel Winters blow, And to moist Northern Pisces leave their Place, Hiding in stormy Seas their sullen Face. With the least hurt provok'd, they arm for fight, And dart a painful Venom where they light: Fixt in the Veins their Sting and Soul they leave, And often perish by the same Wound they give. But if thou seest a cold hard Winter near, And their low Minds, their sickly State declare, Who doubts to spare their Stores, or will delay To burn fresh Thyme, or cut some Wax away? Oft on their Combs, the unseen Lizards light, And buzzing Moths disturb 'em in the night; Or sluggish Drones (on others Toil that thrive) Or Wasps with their unequal Arms arrive. Some filthy Worm gets in, or Spider sets At their Hive's Mouth, her loose and deadly Nets. The more they are exhausted, still the more Their wasted Stock they labour to restore. But if, perhaps (as Life will on the Bees Bring our Distempers) with some new Disease They languish, which no doubtful Signs declare, A horrid paleness will their Looks impair, And dusky Colours their sick Bodies wear. Then bear they out great Numbers of the Dead, And in long Pomp, sad Funerals they lead, Or dully hang, clincht in each others Feet, At the Hive's Mouth, or to their Cells retreat, Through cold or hunger, for their Work unfit. Whispers and Murmuring rise, as when a Breese Of Southern Winds breath on the bending Trees, Or troubled Seas in ebbing Tides retire, Or Forges labour with imprison'd Fire. To burn Galbanean Fumes I would perswade, And through fresh Pipes let Honey be convey'd; So to restore 'em to their Strength and Food. To mix the Juice of Galls, perhaps were good. Dry'd Roses, and new Wines half boil'd away, Clusters of Raisins, Thyme, and Centaury. There is a Flower, which we in Meadows find, And call'd Amello by the Country Hind; By those that seek it, easie to be known, Each single Root a many Branches crown; Yellow the Flowers, but to the numerous Leaves, The darker Purple of the Vi'let cleaves; With it the Altars of the Gods are crown'd, Rough to the Taste, in fruitful Vallies found By Shepherds, that near winding Mella dwell. Boil this sound Root in generous Whit[e]-wine well, Then Osier-pipes with the new Diet fill. But shou'd the whole Stock fail, and none remain, Whence a new Progeny might rise again, 'Tis time, the fam'd Invention to unfold, Of the Arcadian Shepherd, how of old, From the bruis'd Blood of Heifers new slain, Bees Have taken Life, and swarm'd out by degrees Here the whole Story shall at large have place. While the long Fame, I to its Author trace: For where the People of Canopus dwell, And fruitful Waters of fat Nilus swell; On whose smooth Bosom painted Vessels ride, Where-e're it borders on rich Persia's Side; Or with seven Mouths do's the plain Country drown, As far as from parcht India rowling down, Egypt's green Soil, with fruitful Slime to mend; All the vast Region on this Art depend. A Place contracted for that use they chuse, And the low House with narrow Walls inclose: Of well-wrought Tyles, four Windows they contrive To the four Winds expos'd, that may receive The Light obliquely; then they choose a Steer, Whose bending Horns proclaim his Second Year; On him they seize, and stop his struggling Breath At Mouth, and Nostrils, beating him to death. With his bruis'd Entrals his warm Hide they fill, And thus inclos'd, they leave him for a while: Fresh Boughs, Thyme, Cassia's on his sides they throw, E're Western-winds first on the Waters blow; E're Nature with fresh Colours paints the Fields, Or on House-tops the airy Swallow builds. The clotted Blood and dissolv'd Bones, the while Ferment, and into wondrous Creatures boil, Who without Feet at first their Voices try, And with new Wings in little Parties fly; Till they at last break forth, as when a Shower Hot Summers Clouds on the parch'd Mountains pour, Or as the Arrows from the Parth[i]an Bow, When twanging Strings first send 'em on the Foe. What, God, my Muse? who first this Secret taught, Or was it the high Flight of Human Thought? The Shepherd Aristæus (as Fame says) Losing his Flock, through Famine and Disease, Forsook Thessalian Temple, and dismay'd, Ran to the Sacred River's utmost Head, And thus his Moan to his bright Parent made: Mother, Cyrene, Mother who dost keep Thy watry Court beneath this Crystal Deep, Why dost thou say I am of heavenly Race, And sprung from Great Apollo's hot Embrace, Since Fate pursues me thus? Is this thy Love? Why dost thou bid me hope a Seat above, Since in this Life that little Fame decays, Which I by Herds and Gardens thought to raise? With thy own Hand my thriving Woods destroy, Devouring Fire against my Stalls employ, Burn my full Barns, if I too much enjoy, Cut down my Vines, and blast my coming Years, Since my small Fame offends a Mother's Ears. His Voice Cyrene through her Waters heard, While round her Nymphs Milesian Fleeces card; Drymo and Xantho, Ephyre the Fair, Her Neck half cover'd with her flowing Hair; Cydïpe and Lycoris, one a Maid, The other rising from Lucina's Aid; Clio and Beroe, both Ocean-born, Whom well-wrought Gold and painted Skins adorn; Bright Deiopea, Arethusa, now No more a Huntress with her Spear and Bow; To these Clymene sings of Vulcan's Care, Defeated by the amorous God of War: From Chaos she the Loves of Gods relates. Pleas'd with these Tales, while the soft Flax abates From their swift Spindles, the Nymph hears again, Nearer and nearer still her Son complain, All rise astonisht from their green Abode; But Arethusa first above the Flood Lifts her bright Head: The Crystal Waters bow'd, And spying him afar, 'Twas not in vain, Sister, she said, we heard a Voice complain; Sad Aristæus, once thy Care and Joy, See at thy Father's Spring the weeping Boy: By Name he calls thee Cruel and Unkind. Fear and Amazement, seiz'd Cyrene's Mind, Let him, she said, he may behold th' aboads, And tread the Threshold of his kindred Gods. At his command the wondring Rivers spread, And a new Passage for his Entrance made. The Waters like a Mountain stood on Heaps, While he into their yielding Bosom leaps: Down to the bottom, where amaz'd he sees His Mother's Realm and Crystal Palaces: And as he goes, admires the sounding Groves, And hidden Lakes, thro' which the Water moves With such amazing Force, and under Ground Beholds the Rivers that our World go round; Phasis and Lycus, and the sacred Head Whence the deep Waters of Enipeus spread; Whence Aniena and fam'd Tyber flow, The stony Hypanis, Mysus and the Poe, Than which no River runs a swifter Race To his old Father Neptune's moist Embrace. Into her inmost Seat while they withdrew, And of each other took a nearer View, The Nymphs clear Fountains for their Hands prepare, And curious Towels of the finest Hair: Some with full Cups, with Banquets some attend, While in rich Smoak Panchæan Gums ascend: Take this full Bowl of Wine, Cyrene cries, And to the Ocean pour the Sacrifice: To Neptune first, Father of all she Prays; Then Nymphs inhabiting the Woods and Seas; Pure Nectar thrice upon the Fire she throws, And thrice the auspicious Flame up to the Cieling rose: Embolden'd by the Omen, thus she spake, A Prophet dwells in the Carpathian Lake; Green Proteus, whom a wondrous Coach conveighs, And scaly Horses draw through yielding Seas: His own Palene on th' Emathian Shore He visits: Now him, all we Nymphs adore, And aged Nereus self; for well he knows What is, what was, what Fate will next expose: So Neptune has decreed, whose Herds and Flocks He feeds beneath the Ocean's craggy Rocks: Him thou must seize, my Son, and bind him well, Till thy Misfortune's Cause and Cure he tell: For uncompell'd he nothing will declare, Nor can his Heart be touch'd with humane Prayer. When thou hast seiz'd him, chain, or use him worse, His Shifts will fail before the God-like Force: My self, when the Sun climbs the middle Sky, Plants scorch, and Cattle to their Coverts fly, Will bring thee where the aged Prophet lies Dissolv'd in Sleep and Sloth, and easie for surprize. When thou hast seiz'd and bound him, every Shape And frightful Form he'll vary, to escape; One while he'll seem a Dragon, or tusk'd Boar, Then shake his yellow Mane, and like a Lyon roar; Then crackle like a kindling Flame, or slide Out of thy Chains like a declining Tide: The more he varies Forms, my Son, the more Urge thy Success, and never give him o're, Till vext through all his Forms, that Shape he keep Which first he wore when he lay down to sleep. This said, she with Ambrosia scents the Room, And 'noints his Body for the time to come, The Steam Divine on his loose Tresses dwells, And every Nerve which active Vigor swells. Worn in a Mountain's side there is a Cave, Where beat by ceasless Winds the Waters rave; And into crooked Bays the Currents glide, Of old a Port where Vessels us'd to ride: Within lies Proteus, with high Rocks inclos'd. In ambush here her Son the Nymph dispos'd: For her Retreat a distant Cloud she wove; Now Syrius scorcht the Indians from above, And through the middle Sky swift Phœbus drove: Herbs wither'd at his touch, and to the Mud, His thirsty Beams drank up the boiling Flood; When Proteus rising from the Waves repair'd To his old Cave; on him the watry Herd Of Sea-born Monsters their Attendance pay, And in glad Leaps shake the salt Dews away. Around the Shore the sleepy Sea-calves lay; He, like a Herdsman on some Hill that lives, When Night the lazy Cattle homeward drives, And bleating Lambs the hungry Woolf provoke, Reviews and tells 'em over, from his Rock: Seeing his time, the bold Youth on him rush'd, And with new Chains the aged Prophet crush'd. He on the other side trys every Shape, And dreadful Form, whereby he might escape: One while a Monster, Flame, and then a Flood. Finding himself through all his Shifts pursu'd, Wearied' o'ercome, his former Shape he took, And with a Humane Voice at last he spoke: Bold Youth, who bid thee to our Cave repair? What would'st thou learn? he said, What mak'st thou here? Proteus, thou know'st no Man can thee deceive, Deceive not others by the Gods high Leave; Ruin'd, undone, I come to know of thee, What was the Cause, what is the Remedy. Here the green Prophet cast a dreadful Look, He star'd, he gnasht his Teeth, and big with Fate thus spoke: Some powerful God with no light Wrath pursues Thy fatal Crime; now injur'd Orp[h]eus shews His fierce Revenge, he this Contagion sent, For his lost Wife too small a Punishment: Unhappy Nymph, who while she headlong fled Thy foul Pursuit, on a loathed Serpent's Head Trod unawares, which then she could not see For the long Grass, and for worse Fears of thee: For equal, Nymphs the Dryades with shrill Complaints and Shrieks the neighbouring Mountains fill. The Towers of Rhodope, the Gætan Race, The rough Inhabitants of Warlike Thrace; Pangæum, Hebrus, Orithyia, all, With their united Grief lament her Fall: He on bleak Sands, soothing his vain Desire, Wanders alone, and with his mournful Lyre Feeding his Grief, pining himself away, With her begins, with her he ends the Day. The Jaws of Tænarus, Infernal Gates, Dark Groves he past, where dismal Terrour waits; To Ghosts, and their dread King, does fearless sue, And Minds that never yet Compassion knew: Charm'd with his Voice the airy People throng About the Youth, and listen to his Song; Thick as small Birds to their dark Coverts fly, When th' Evening comes, or the tempestuous Sky Pours down a Storm. Mothers with Husbands, and the breathless Shades Of once great Heroes, Boys, and riper Maids, Unmarry'd Youth whom their fond Parents mourn'd, Before their Face t' untimely Ashes turn'd. All these with filthy Mud, rank ugly Weeds, Such as alone infernal Water breeds, Styx does nine times surround the House of Fate, And Snake-hair'd Furies in Amazement sate. Cerberus three Mouths were dumb, Ixion's Wheel, And Winds that move it at, his Song, were still. Now he returning, had all Dangers past, And freed Eurydice beheld at last The upper Sky again, following behind, unseen, So far obeying the infernal Queen; Here Love, Rage, Joy, to a short Madness drive, Th' impatient Lover, (could those Gods forgive, How small a Fault!) here fatally he staid, Rashly forgetting the Agreement made: With the first Glimpse of fresh Ethereal Light, On his dear Wife he turn'd his longing Sight: Here vanish'd all his Labour, and their Law Those unrelenting Powers neglected saw. Three Peals of Thunder shook th' infernal Coast, Orpheus, she cry'd, was ever Love so crost? How are we both by thy rash Passion lost? Fate puts me back, and my declining Sight Feels the cold Hand of Death and endless Night. Farewel, farewel for ever, now I go Plung'd deep in Darkness, to the World below; Stretching to thee, (dear Cause of all my Harms) No longer thine, alas! my helpless Arms. And at that Word from his distracted sight, Like Smoak mixt with thin Air, she took her flight, Ne'r to return again. At the dear Shade In vain he catcht, and much he wou'd have said, Too late: For surly Charon wou'd no more Permit his Passage to the Elysian Shore. His Wife twice lost, ah, Whither shou'd he move? With what soft Prayer invoke the Powers above? Or with what Tears the Shades? cold in the Boat, On the dark Lake she did already float. 'Tis said seven Months he did his Loss deplore On the bleak Rocks of Strymon's Desart-shore; Singing this sad Event of too much Love, He soften'd Tygers and made Forrests move. As in some Poplar Shade the Nightingal, In mournful Strains, does her lost Young bewail, Whom some course Hind has newly torn away From their warm Nests, unfeather'd as they lay. Night after Night, upon some Bough she sits, And her sad Note no Moment intermits, Which every Field and echoing Grove repeats: Nor Love, nor Marriage charm'd his restless Mind; Alone he wanders, where the Northern Wind Beats upon snowy Tanais chilling Shoar, Where Ice ne're fails, and ceasless Tempests roar; There his lost Wife he mourns in doleful Strains, And of the Gods and their vain Gift complains. The fierce Sithonian Women thus despis'd, As they the Feast of Bacchus solemniz'd, Full of their God, and boiling with disdain, Scatter'd his bleeding Limbs through all the Plain. From his firm Neck his gory Head thus torn, Down the swift Stream of rapid Hebrus born, Shriekt out, Ah poor Eurydice, and dy'd, The echoing Banks Eurydice reply'd. This said, he plung'd into his watry World, About his Head the foaming Billows curl'd. Her anxious Son divine Cyrene chears, Here end thy Grief, she said, and needless Cares: This was the Cause of all thy Woe, the Crime, For which the Nymphs, Companions of her prime, Whom she in sacred Dances us'd to lead, Among thy Bees that dire Contagion spread. With Prayers and Sacrifice their Wrath appease: Napæan Nymphs invok't, forgive with ease. Take four curl'd Bullocks of thy largest breed, Whom now the Hills of green Lycæus feed; As many untam'd Heifers; and for these Four Altars in their Sacred Temples raise: Then from their wounded Throats let out the Blood, And leave their Bodies in some shady Wood. Soon as the ninth Aurora gilds the Skies, To Orpheus drowzy Poppeys sacrifice, With a black Lamb; then view the Grove again; Eurydice, with a Calf newly slain Thou shalt appease. Without delay he goes; All she commands immediately he does: Comes to the Temple, does the Altars raise; Four mighty Bulls of wondrous Bulk he slays, As many Heifers that ne'r felt the Yoke, When from the East the ninth Aurora broke: He Worships Orpheus, to the Grove he goes; When lo a strange and wondrous Sight arose. From the Bulls Entrails Bees were found to hum, And met in Swarms from out the putrid Womb: In moving Clouds to the next Tree they go, And hang like Cluster'd Grapes upon a bending Bough. While thus of Plants, Tillage, and Herds I sung, With Cæsar's thundring Arms Euphrates rung. Just Laws he for the willing World ordain'd; By God-like Acts his Claim to Heaven maintain'd. Me all that while proud Naples did embrace, Fam'd for th' inglorious Arts of lazy Peace: Full of the Loves of Shepherds, bold and young, Under the Beechen Shade, thee, Tityrus, I sung. TRANSLATIONS FROM OVID'S AMORES PRINTED IN “DRYDEN'S MISCELLANY,” 1684 XCI BOOK I Elegy the Eighth He Curses a Bawd, for going about to debauch his Mistress. There is a Bawd renown'd in Venus Wars, And dreadfull still with honourable scars: Her youth and beauty, craft and guile supply Sworn Foe to all degrees of Chastity. Dypsas who first taught Love sick Maids the way To cheat the Bridegroom on the Wedding day. And then a hundred subtile tricks devis'd, Wherewith the Amorous Theft might be disguis'd. Of Pigeons-blood, squeez'd from the panting heart, With Surfeit-water to contract the part, She knows the Use: whilst the good man betray'd, With eager Arms huggs the false bleeding Maid. Of herbs and Spells she tries the Guilty Force, The poyson of a Mare that goes to Horse. Cleaving the Midnight Air upon a Switch, Some for a Bawd, most take her for a Witch. Each Morning sees her reeling to her Bed, Her Native Blew o'ercome with drunken red. Her ready Tongue ne'er wants an usefull lie, Soft moving words, nor Charming flattery. Thus I o'erheard her to my Lucia speak, Young Damon's Heart wilt thou for ever break? He long has lov'd thee, and by me he sends To learn thy motions, which he still attends. If to the Park thou go, the Plays are ill; If to the Plays, he thinks the Air wou'd kill. The other day he gaz'd upon thy Face, As he wou'd grow a Statue in the place; And who in deed has not? like a new Star, Beauty like thine strikes Wonders from afar. Alas, methinks thou art ill drest to night, This Point's too poor; thy Necklace is not right. This Gown was by some botching Taylor made, It spoils thy Shape; this Fucus is ill laid. Hear me, and be as happy as thou'rt fair, Damon is rich and what thou want'st can spare. Like thine his Face, like thine his Eyes are thought, Wou'd he not buy, he might himself be bought. Fair Lucia blusht; It is a sign of Grace, Dypsas reply'd, that Red becomes thy Face. All Lovers now by what they give are weigh'd, And she is best belov'd that is best paid. The Sun-burnt Latines, in old Tatius Reign, Did to one man perhaps their love restrain. Venus in her Aeneas City rules, And all adore her Deity, but Fools. Go on, ye Fair, Chaste onely let such live, As none will ask, and know not how to give. How prettily you frown[!] But I'll speak on, Hear me, another day 'twill be your own. Vertuous Penelope is said t'have try'd, With a strong Bow, each lusty Lover's side. Nor did Lucretia kill herself for rage, But love of Tarquin, in that colder Age. To the young Prince she vow'd, ne'er more to joyn In dull Embraces with her Collatine. To keep her word she dy'd— Life steals away, and our best hours are gone, E'er the true Use, or worth of them, be known. Things long neglected of themselves decay, What we forbear time rudely makes his prey. Beauty is best preserv'd by Exercise, Nor for that Task can one or few suffice. Wou'dst thou grow rich, thou must from many take; From one 'twere hard continually to rake. With out new Gowns, and Coaches, who can live? What does thy Poet, but new Verses give? A Poet, the last thing that Earth does breed, Whose Wit, for sixpence, any one may reade. Him that will give, to Homer I prefer, To give is an ingenious thing I swear. Despise not any can a present make, It matters not from whom, but what we take. Nor with the sound of titles be thou caught, For nothing can with empty Names be bought. Hang the poor Lover, and his Pedigree, The thriving Merchant, or fat Judge give me. If any beardless Stripling ask a Night, And think thee paid with mutual delight; Bid him go earn thy price among the men, And when he has it, come to thee again. Love truly none, but seem in Love with all, And at old friends to thy new Lover rail. Sometimes deny, 'twill Appetite procure; The sharp-set Hawks will stoop to any Lure. Then grant again, lest he a habit get Of living from thee, but be sure thou let No empty Lover in: murmur sometimes, And as first hurt, reproach him with thy Crimes. Seem jealous, when thou'st been thy self to blame, 'Twill stop his mouth, if thou the first complain. All thou hast done be ready to forswear, For Lovers Oaths fair Venus has no Ear, Whilst he is with thee, let some Woman bring Some Indian stuff, or Foreign pretious thing; Which thou must say thou want'st, and he must buy, Though for it six months hence in Gaol he lye. Thy Mother, Sister, Brother, and thy Nurse, Must have a pull each at thy Lover's Purse. Let him from Rivals never be secure, That hope once gone, Love will not long endure. Shew him the presents by those Rivals sent, So shall his bounty thy request prevent. When he will give no more, ask him to lend, If he wants money, find a trusting Friend. Get hangings, Cabinets, a Looking-glass[,] Or any thing for which his word will pass. Practise these Rules, thou'lt find the benefit; I lost my Beauty e'er I got this wit. I at that word stept from behind the door, And scarce my Nails from her thin Cheeks forbore. Her few Grey hairs in rage I vow'd to pull. And thrust her drunken eyes into her Skull. Poor in a Dungeons bottom mayst thou rot, Dye with a blow with thy beloved Pot, No Brandy and Eternal thirst thy Lot. XCII BOOK II Elegy the Fifth To his false Mistress. Cupid, begon! who wou'd on thee rely, And thus at every moment wish to dye? Death is my wish, when on thy guilt I think, (Thy faithless guilt) at which I fain wou'd wink. False Maid, thou various torment of my life, Thou flying pleasure, and thou lasting grief; No doubtfull Letters thy lost faith accuse, Nor private gifts, thou mightst with ease excuse Such proofs, one word of thine might overcome; Why is my cause so good, and thou so dumb? Happy's the man that's handsomely deceiv'd, Whose Mistress swears and lies, and is believ'd. Those Eyes beheld thee, when thou thoughtst me In books and signs (nor yet in those alone) Conveying the glad message of thy Love To that gay, vain, dull Fopp that sate above. I knew the Language soon, what could be hid From Lovers Eyes of all ye said or did? When others rose, I saw thee Dart a kiss, The wanton prelude to a farther bliss: Not such as Wives to their cold Husbands give, But such as hot Adulterers receive. Such as might kindle frozen appetite, And fire even wasted nature with delight. What art thou mad, I cry'd, before my face, To steal my wealth, and my new Rival grace? I'll rise and seize my own upon the place. These soft endearments should not farther go, But be the secret treasure of us two, How comes this third in for a share I'd know? This, and what more my grief inspir'd, I said; Her face she cover'd with a Conscious red: Like a Cloud guilded by the rising Sun, Or Virgin newly by her Love undone. Those very blushes pleas'd, when she cast down Her lovely Eyes, with a disdainfull frown. Disdain became her, looking on the Earth, Sad were her looks, but Charming above mirth. I could have kill'd my self or him, or her, Scarce did my rage her tender Cheeks forbear: When I beheld her Face my anger cool'd, I felt myself to a mere Lover fool'd. I, who but now so fierce, grow tame and sue, With such a kiss we might our Love renew. She smil'd and gave me one might Jove disarm, And from his hand the brandisht Thunder charm. 'Twas worse than Death, to think my Rival knew Such Joys as till that hour to me were new. She gave much better kisses than I taught, And something strange was in each touch methought. They pleas'd me but too well, and thou didst tongue, With too much art and skill, for one so young: Nor is this all, though I of this complain, Nor should I for a kiss be so in pain: But thine cou'd never but in Bed be taught, I fear how dear thou hast thy Knowledge bought. XCIII BOOK III Elegy the Fourth To A Man that lockt up his Wife. Vex not thy self and her, vain Man, since all By their own Vice, or Vertue stand or fall. She's truely chaste and worthy of that name, Who hates the ill as well as fears the shame: And that vile Woman whom restraint keeps in Though she forbear the Act, has done the Sin. Spies, Locks and Bolts may keep her brutal Part, But thou'rt an odious Cuckold in her heart. They that have Freedom use it least, and so The power of ill does the design o'erthrow. Provoke not Vice by a too harsh restraint, Sick men long most to drink, who know they may'nt. The fiery Courser, whom no Art can stay Or rugged force, does oft fair means obey: And he that did the rudest Arme disdain, Submits with Quiet to the looser rein. An hundred Eyes had Argos, yet the while One silly Maid did all those Eyes beguile. Danae though shut within a brasen Tower, Felt the male virtue of the Golden shower: But chaste Penelope, left to her own will And free disposal, never thought of ill; She to her absent Lord preserv'd her truth, For all th'Addresses of the smoother Youth. What's rarely seen our fancy magnifies, Permitted pleasure who does not despise? Thy Care provokes beyond her Face, and more Men strive to make the Cuckold, than the Whore. They're wondrous charms we think and long to know, That in a Wife inchant a Husband so: Rage, Swear and Curse, no matter, shee alone Pleases who sighs and cryes I am undone; But could thy Servants say we have kept her chaste? Good Servants then but an ill Wife thou hast. Who fears to be a Cuckold is a Clown, Not worthy to partake of this lewd Town: Where it is monstrous to be fair and Chaste, And not one Inch of either Sex lies waste. Wouldst thou be happy? with her ways comply, And in her Case lay Poynts of honour by: The Friendship she begins wisely improve, And a fair Wife gets one a world of Love: So shalt thou wellcome be to Every treat, Live high, not pay, and never run in debt.</field>

XCIV DISTICH Although no Art the Fire of Love can tame, 'Tis oft extinguish't by an equal flame.The attribution of this poem is questionable. XCV [The painted Apples that adorn]The attribution of this poem is questionable. The painted Apples that adorn, Of yon'd fair Tree, the Airy top, And seems our dull approach to scorn, From their weak Stalk must one day drop; And out of reach of Mortals plac't, Be the vile food of Worms at last; Thus ends of Humane things the Pride, Borne down Times ever-flowing Tide. Thy matchless Beauty, that we all Now with such heat and passion court, Though kept from worthy Lovers, shall Confess its Tyranny but short: Then do not Love with Anger meet, Nor cruel be, to seem discreet; Shunning what nature does intend, Things seldom meet a nobler end. From Stephens's Miscellany Poems, 1685 XCVI UPON THE SLIGHTING OF HIS FRIENDS LOVEThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Love guides my hand, and shews me what to write, That (thou) mayst know 'tis she that doth Indite. When Love's concern'd to make her language known, She doth by Numbers soft, and sweet, bemoan (Thy silence) enough to make her sigh and groan. She fears that thy sweet Natur's wing'd away, Because not touch'd, by its enlivening Ray: She doubts some Veil has overspread its Light, Which threatens more than an Aegyptian Night; Wherein nought but sad mournful Clouds appear, Enough to strike thee into endless fear. When she on every side doth cast an Eye, To see (perhaps) if once she might descry Her pleasing, look'd for Object passing by. There's nought appears, her Vigilance is vain; Her careful Eye is recompenc'd with pain. Then down she sinks, bereav'd of her sweet breath The only sign, that now she's seiz'd with Death. Weep now ye Heavens; and let each pearly tear Accompany mounting grief, and trembling fear. For since Love's dead, the Beauty of our Isle, Its more than madness to attempt a smile; This rather would become some pompous, nuptial train, Than him, whose Heart feels griefs insulting pain. When once a Jewel's lost, how careful is each Eye, In prying out this Author of our misery? No less is he depriv'd of courting rest When Love has left a drooping, panting Breast. Curs'd be that Person, who has chas'd thee hence, Heaven, with this black crime, can ne're dispence! Curs'd be that time, that e're she fix'd on thee, The Mother of such unheard of Cruelty. Curs'd be that place, in which she did impart Her amorous smiles, her most alluring Art. In fine a Curse all Curses else above On her, that dar'd to stab our darling Love! May never once Loves Charms attend thee more, Till thou attones for what is done before. What have I said! this, this, can never be Done by the hands of basest Treachery. No, no: we must the Gods above implore, Who only can the dead, to life restore. Be propitious then, ye ruling Pow'rs above, And send us back our hence departed Love. That we may see her raise a tow'ring frame Adorn'd with lustre from her radiant flame Too great to be exprest by empty name. Bless us but in this, and then shall we In reverence bow, a lowly thankful Knee, Before the throne of your own sacred Deity. Our words, like well tun'd Instruments shall be, Breathing forth nought but grateful Harmony Our Actions, they shall pay you Tribute, too, For all is yours, when once we are blest by you. From Poetical Recreations, 1688 XCVII UPON A GENTLEWOMANS REFUSAL OF A LETTER FROM ONE SHE WAS INGAGED TOThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Not hear my Message, but the Bearer shun! What hellish Fiend inrag'd could more have done? Surely the Gods design to make my Fate Of all most wretched, and unfortunate. 'Twas but a Letter, and the Words were few, Fill'd with kind wishes, but my Fate's too true. I'm lost for ever banish'd from her sight, Although by Oaths and Vows she's mine by right. Ye Gods! look down and hear my Sorrows moan, Like the faint Echoes of a dying groan. But now is't possible so fair a Face Shou'd have a Soul so treacherous and base, To promise constancy, and then to prove False and unkind to him she vow'd to love? Oh, Barb'rous Sex! whose Nature is to rook And cheat Mankind with a betraying look. Hence I'll keep guard within from all your Charms, And ever more resist all fresh Alarms; I'll trace your windings through the darkest Cell, And find your Stratagems, though lodg'd in Hell. Your gilded Paintings, and each treacherous Wile, By which so eas'ly you Mankind beguile; Winds are more Constant than a Womans Mind, Who holds to none but to the present kind: For when by absence th' object is remov'd, The time is gone and spent wherein she lov'd. And is it not the very same with me, To slight my Love, when I must absent be? Perhaps sh' has seen a more atracting Face, And a new Paramour has taken place, And shall my injur'd Soul stand Mute, and live, Whilst that another reaps what she can give? Glutted with pleasures, and again renew Their past delights, although my claim and due. Oh, no, my Soul's inrag'd, revenge calls on, I'll tear her piece-meal e'er my fury's gone; Stretch out my Arm all o'er th' inconstant stain, And then cleave down her treach'rous limbs in twain: The greatest plagues Invention e'er cou'd find, Is not sufficient for th' inconstant Mind. I think I have o'ercome my Passion quite, And cou'd not love, although 'twere in despight. As for the Man who must enjoy my room, He'll soon be partner in my wretched doom; He by her Faith, alas, no more will find, Than when she swore to me to prove most kind. Therefore I'll leave her and esteem her less; And in my self both joy and acquiesce. But oh, my Heart, there's something moves there still, Sure 'tis the vigour of unbounded Will. Too much, I fear, my Fetters are not gone, Or I at least again must put them on. Methinks I feel my Heart is not got free, Nor all my Passions set at liberty, From the bright glances of her am'rous Eye. Down Rebel-love, and hide thy boyish Head, I'm too much Man to hear thy follies plead: Go seek some other Breast of lower note; Go make some Old decrepit Cuckold dote: Begone I say, or strait thy Quiver, Bow, And thou thy self fall to destruction too. And oh, I'm gone, my Foes have all got ground, My Brains grow giddy, and my Head turns round. My Heart's intangled with the Nets of Love; My Passions rave, and now ye Gods above Help on my doom, and heave me to your Skies; Look, look, Mervinda's just before my Eyes: Help me to catch her e'er her Shadow fly, And I fall downward from this rowling Sky. XCVIII SONG The Prodigal's Resolution The attribution of this poem is questionable. I I am a lusty lively Lad, Arriv'd at One-and-Twenty; My Father left me all he had, Both Gold and Silver plenty. Now He's in Grave, I will be brave, The Ladies shall adore me; I'll Court and Kiss, what hurt's in this? My Dad did so before me. II My Father, to get my Estate, Though selfish, yet was slavish; I'll spend it at another rate, And be as leudly lavish. From Mad-men, Fools, and Knaves he did, Litigiously receive it; If so he did, Justice forbid, But I to such shou'd leave it. III Then I'll to Court, where Venus sport, Doth revel it in plenty; And deal with all, both great and small, From twelve to five and twenty. In Play-houses I'll spend my Days, For there are store of Misses; Ladies, make room, behold I come, To purchase many Kisses. XCIX SONG The Doubtfull Lover Resolv'd The attribution of this poem is questionable. Fain wou'd I Love, but that I fear, I quickly shou'd the Willow wear: Fain wou'd I Marry, but Men say, When Love is try'd, he will away. Then tell me, Love, what I shall doe, To cure these Fears whene'er I Wooe. The Fair one, she's a mark to all; The Brown one each doth lovely call; The Black a Pearl in fair Mens Eyes, The rest will stoop to any prize. Then tell me, Love, what I shall doe, To cure these Fears when e'er I Woe. Reply Go, Lover, know it is not I That wound with fear or jealousie; Nor do Men feel those [killing] smarts, Untill they have confin'd their Hearts. Then if you'll cure your Fears you shall Love neither Fair, Black, Brown, but all. C SONG The Cavalier's Catch The attribution of this poem is questionable. I Did you see this Cup of Liquor, How invitingly it looks; 'Twill make a Lawyer prattle quicker, And a Scholar burn his Books: 'Twill make a Cripple for to Caper, And a Dumb Man clearly Sing; 'Twill make a Coward draw his Rapier, Here's a Health to James our King. II If that here be any Round-head, That refuse this Health to pledge; I wish he then may be confounded, Underneath some rotten Hedge, May the French Disease o'er-take him, And upon his Face appear, And his Wife a Cuckold make him, By some Jovial Cavalier. CI SONGThe attribution of this poem is questionable. I Evadne, I must tell you so, You are too cruel grown; No smiles nor pity you bestow, But Death in ev'ry frown. My Love, though chast and constant too, Yet no relief can find; Curst be the Slave that's false to you, Though you are still unkind. II Were you as merciful as fair, My wishes wou'd obtain; But love I must, though I despair, And perish in the pain. If in an Age I can prevail, I happy then shall be; And cou'd I live, I wou'd not fail To wait Eternally. From Buckingham's Miscellaneous Works, 1704 CII THE ROYAL KNOTTER The attribution of this poem is questionable. I Ah happy People ye must thrive Whilst thus the Royal Pair does strive Both to advance your Glory; While he (by's Valour) conquers France, She Manufacturers does advance, And makes Thread-fringes for ye. II Bless'd we! who from such Queens are freed, Who by vain Superstition led, Are always telling Beads; But here's a Queen, now, thanks to God, Who, when she rides in Coach abroad, Is always knotting Threads. III Then hast, victorious Nassau, hast, And when thy Summer Show is past, Let all thy Trumpets sound: The Fringe which this Campain has wrought, Tho' it cost the Nation scarce a Groat, Thy Conquests will surround. CIII ADVICE TO LOVERS The attribution of this poem is questionable. I Damon, if thou wilt believe me, 'Tis not Sighing round the Plain, Songs and Sonnets cann't relieve thee, Faint attempts in love are vain. II Urge but home the fair Occasion, And be Master of the Field; To a powerful kind invasion 'Tis a Madness not to yield. III Love gives out a large Commission, Still indulgent to the brave; But one Sin of large Omission, Never Woman yet forgave, IV Though she swears she'll ne'er permit you, Cries you're rude, and much to blame, Or with Tears implores your Pity, Be not merciful for shame. V When the fierce Assault is over, Chloris soon enough must find This her cruel furious Lover Much more gentle, not so kind. CIV AGAINST HIS MISTRESS'S CRUELTY The attribution of this poem is questionable. I Love, How unequal are thy Laws, That Men that least endeavour Thou favour'st, and neglect'st the Cause Of those that most persever! II What careless Lovers have been blest, Untouch'd with Grief and Anguish, Since cruel Sylvia charm'd my Breast, Unmov'd to see me languish! III I find my fatal Error now In thinking e'er to move her, Too great the Difficulty grew For any mortal Lover. IV But what Advantage can it bring That I at last perceive it? 'Twas rash to undertake the thing, And 'tis too late to leave it. CV THE PETITION The attribution of this poem is questionable. Oh Lycidas, why thus alone With Arms a cross, dost sigh and moan? Can thy Cosmelia prove unkind, Or ought prevail to change her Mind? She was, she is great Nature's Pride; In Goodness, to the best ally'd In her bright Eyes such Beauties Shine, Mercy would make her all divine; O ye propitious Powers above, That gently do incline to love, Convey into her Breast soft Fire, Amorous Thoughts, and kind Desire. But if it be decreed by Fate, That I must love, and she must hate; Ah! let her not Disdain to give A Tear, when I no longer live. From the Diverting Post, 1704 CVI By Sir Charles Sidley. Written Extempore [The Noble Man, why he's a thing] The attribution of this poem is questionable. The Noble Man, why he's a thing Thats next in Honour to the King; But if his Lordship's Knave or Fool, At best he's but a Noble Tool, Either to work with or be wrought on, As odd a thing as can be thought on: What signifies an empty Word, His Grace, his Highness, or my Lord, Saving your Presence, not a T?d. 'Tis Virtue stamps his Character, And adds a lustre to his Star. From Poems on State Affairs, 1705 CVII A FABLE The attribution of this poem is questionable. In Aesop's Tales an honest Wretch we find, Whose Years and Comforts equally declin'd; He in two Wives had two domestick Ills, For different Age they had and different Wills One pluckt his Black Hairs out, and one his Grey, The Man for quietness did both obey, Till all his Parish saw his Head quite bare, And thought he wanted Brains as well as Hair. The Moral The Parties hen-peckt W?m, are they Wives, The Hairs they pluck are thy Prerogatives; Tories thy Person hate, the Whigs thy Power, Tho much thou yieldest, till they tug for more, Till this poor Man, and thou, alike are shown, He without Hair, and thou without a Crown. From Briscoe's Edition of 1707 CVIII ON THE HAPPY CORYDON AND PHILLIS The attribution of this poem is questionable. Young Coridon and Phillis, Sat in a lovely Grove, Contriving Crowns of Lillies, Repeating toys of Love, And something else, but what I dare not name; But as they were a playing, She ogled so the Swain, It sav'd her plainly saying, Let's kiss to ease our pain, and something else. A thousand times he kist her, Laying her on the Green; But as he further prest her A pritty Leg was seen, and ? So many Beauties viewing, His Ardor still increast, And greater Joys pursuing, He wander'd o'er her Breast, and ? A last effort she trying His Passion to withstand, Cry'd, but 'twas faintly Crying, Pray take away your Hand, and ? Young Corydon grown bolder, The Minutes wou'd improve, This is the time, he told her To shew you how I Love, and ? The Nymph seem'd almost dying, Dissolv'd in amorous Heat, She kiss'd, and told him sighing, My Dear, your Love is great, and ? But Phillis did recover, Much sooner than the Swain, She blushing ask'd her Lover, Shall we not kiss again, and ? Thus Love his Revells keeping, Till Nature at a stand, From talk they fell to sleeping, Holding each other's Hand, and ? CIX ON A LADY THAT DID NOT LOVE APPLES The attribution of this poem is questionable. Happy our Race; and blessed all Mankind, Had but Eve's Palate been, like yours, refin'd, Nor meanly stoop'd, while in her natures Pride, To taste the poorest Fruit, that Heav'n deny'd. But nought tempts Woman, more than a Restraint, Access deny, and strait on that they're bent; And had your Coyness, in her place been found, The Devil had strove in vain to give the Wound. Tho' cast his Serpents Skin, to be more fair, Tho' dress'd like Beau, and courted with an Air, For where Man fails, the Devil must sure dispair: In vain, he'd strove your Virgin Heart to Storm, We'd all been sav'd, had you her part perform'd. But since long time will not that change allow, Be but a second Eve, and save us now. CX ON FRUITION The attribution of this poem is questionable. None, but a Muse in Love, can tell The sweet tumultuous joys I feel, When on Cælia's Breast I lye, When I tremble, faint, and dye; Mingling Kisses with Embraces, Darting Tongues, and joyning Faces, Panting, stretching, sweating, cooing, All in the extasie, of doing. From Briscoe's Edition of 1722 CXI TO CELINDA The attribution of this poem is questionable. Celinda, think not by Disdain, To vanquish my Desire By telling me, I sigh in vain And feed a hopeless Fire. Despair it self too weak does prove, Your Beauty to disarm, By Fate I was ordain'd to Love, As you were born to Charm. CXII A SONG The attribution of this poem is questionable. Celinda Prithee tell me, faithless Swain, Why shou'd you such Passion feign, On purpose to deceive me? So soon as I to love began, Then you began to leave me. Damon Celinda, you must blame your Fate, Kindness has its certain Date, E'er we the Joys have tasted, Had you not then with feigned Hate Love's kindest Hours wasted. Then weep no more, nor sigh in vain, But lay your Baits to catch again A more deserving Lover; For know, a Slave who's broke his Chain You never can recover. CXIII CUPID'S RETURN The attribution of this poem is questionable. Welcome, thrice welcome to my frozen Heart, Thou long departed Fire, How could'st thou so regardless be Of one so true, so fond as me, Whose early Thought, whose first Desire Was pointed all to thee? When in the Morning of my Day, Thy Empire first began, Pleased with the Prospect of thy Sway, Into thy Arms I ran; Without Reserve my willing Heart I gave; Proud that I had my Freedom lost: Contending which I ought to boast The making thee a Sov'reign, or my self a Slave. Still I am form'd to execute thy Will, By me declare thy Power and Skill; My Heart already by thy Fire Is so prepar'd, is so refin'd, There's nothing left behind But infinite Desire. O! would'st thou touch that lovely Maid, (Whose Charms and thine I have obey'd) With such another Flame, The Heav'n that would appear in me, Wou'd speak such Goodness dwelt in thee; Thy Bow, thy Art, No more need guide thy Dart; No Art so stubborn but at that would aim. THE PASTORALS OF VIRGIL CXIV THE FIRST PASTORAL [OF VIRGIL] The attribution of this poem is questionable. T[ity]rus Melibæus Melibæus You T[ity]rus! in the cool refreshing Shade Of a broad Beach, thus negligently lay'd, In your sweet Pipe and rural Muse delight. We forc'd, alas! from our dear Country's fight And pleasant Fields, in sad Distress to fly, Are doom'd in woful Banishment to lie: You undisturb'd here sing your am'rous Lays, And make the Groves sound Amaryllis Praise. Tityrus This Leisure 'twas a God bestow'd: for he, Oh Melibæus! shall be such to me; Oft shall his Altar with Devotion due, The streaming Blood of my young Lambs imbrue. He suffer'd as you see my Herds to stray, And will'd that on my Pipe, I shou'd securely play. Melibæus I envy not thy Case, but wonder much, While of our Plains the sad Distraction's such; See ailing thence, I my She-Goats convey. This, Tityrus! I can hardly drag away, Amid'st the Hazels, as I came along, She yeaning unexpectedly two young; (The Hope of my unhappy Flock) has left On the hard Stone of ev'ry Help bereft. This sad Mischance, was I not stupid grown! My blasted Oaks had oftentimes made known, And often from a hollow Holm the Crow Did on the left the coming Mischief show: But yet oh! Tityrus! I pray disclose The God who this distinguish'd Favour shows. Tityrus The City they call Rome, as yet unknown, I thought, oh Melibæus! like our own, (Fool that I was) whither we us'd to go, And oft the young-ones of our Flock bestow, So Whelps I had perceiv'd, were like their Damms, And like the Mother Ews, the tender Lambs: So little Things I did compare with great, But other Cities this excels in State, Rising o'er all, as Cypresses exceed The creeping Osier, or the binding Reed. Melibæus And what was the prevailing Cause that drew Your mind this great aspiring Rome to view? Tityrus 'Twas Liberty, which tho', it scarce appear'd, When the grey Hairs were sprinkled in my Beard, Long look'd-for kindly did arrive at last, When Galatea's early Love was pass'd, And Amaryllis did my Heart possess; For dallying with the first, I must confess, No hope of Liberty, nor Care had I T' increase my Store, or gain a fit Supply, To cure my Wants; tho' often of the best, Pass'd from my Folds, and store of Cheese was press'd. Unprofitably to the City sent, For what I got, I there profusely spent. Melibæus Oh Amaryllis! little guess I had For whom you pray'd, for whom you was so sad; For what Occasion, for whose sake so long Th' ungather'd Apples on their Branches hung. Tityrus was hence; oh Tityrus! thy lov'd Name, The Springs, the Pines, nay Bushes did proclaim. Tityrus What shou'd I do? what cou'd I hope to be By other means from lasting Service free? Nor cou'd I think to find another, where A fav'ring God so ready to my Prayer! Here Melibæus! I beheld him here, The Youth for whom our Altars twice a Year Shall smoke with Incense. He (when I address'd) Kindly and soon, thus answer'd my Request. Go Boy! be still on Rural Works imploy'd, And hold whatever ye before enjoy'd. Melibæus Oh bless'd old Man! thy Lands shall then endure, And all Possessions still to thee secure; And large enough shall for thyself be found, Tho' Stones and Reeds o'erspread the nearest Ground: Thy Flocks from Beasts of Prey no harm shall find Nor catch Infection from their neighbouring kind. Oh fortunate old Man! who may abide Thus sweetly by this noted River's side, Here with Delight thy leisure Time employ, And of these sacred Springs the cool enjoy. Here from the bord'ring Hedge the passing Bees, Thy Ears shall with continual Murmurs please, Soft Sleep invite, and give thy Labours ease. The Pruner from the lofty Mountain there, With chearful Songs shall chace intruding Care: Here thy lov'd Pidgeons shall delight thy view, There on sweet Elms the Turtles sweetly coo. Tityrus Therefore the Stags shall mounting feed in Air, And Occeans sinking, leave their Fishes bare On the dry Sands, the Parthians from their home, And hardy Germans shall be forc'd to roam, And to each others Land in Exile come, Before the Figure of this Youth depart, And quit Possession of my grateful Heart. Melibæus But we must hence dispers'd and driven go To sultry Africk, and to Scythia's Snow, Part must with speed repair to spacious Crete, And near the swift Oaxis take their Seat: Part must on Britain's barb'rous Land be hurl'd, Amongst a Race divided from the World: Yet when a long unhappy Time is pass'd, Oh! may I see my Country's Bounds at last, And pleas'd, and wond'ring visit once again My poor thatch'd Dwelling where I us'd to reign! Shall a vile Soldier these neat Fields command? This Harvest bless a wicked barb'rous Hand? Oh fatal Strife! from thee what Sorrows flow? From thee what Ills we wretched People know? See who the Fruits of all our Toil possess, Now graft thy Pears, fond Swain! thy Vineyards dress! Hence ye She-goats! once prosp'rous and my Care, Begone, henceforth stretch'd on the Grass, I ne'er Shall see ye hanging on a Rock afar; Henceforth no Verses shall I sing, nor more Protect and feed ye as I did before. Tityrus With me this Night however chuse to stay, Forgetting Care yourself reposing lay On the green Leaf, and of our present Fare, (Curds, Chessnuts, Apples) take a welcome Share, For see the Village Tops begin to fume, And vaster Shadows from the Mountains come. CXV THE SECOND PASTORAL [OF VIRGIL]The attribution of this poem is questionable. The fair Alexis was his Master's Joy, And Coridon lov'd the delicious Boy, But failing of his Hope, he daily go's Where Beachen Boughs a constant Shade compose, There to the Woods and Mountains thus alone, Makes in imperfect Strains his fruitless Moan. Cruel Alexis! must my Verse and I Be thus disdain'd by thee? Ah! must I die, Thro' thy Unkindness most unhappy made? Now Cattle seek the cool refreshing Shade, And Thestylis sweet Herbs do's mixing beat For weary Mowers vext with Toil and Heat; But while in eager Search of thee I run, With me beneath the persecuting Sun, The Grashoppers from ev'ry Bush bemoan Their Case, and grate my Ears with a harsh Tone; Had it not better been for me poor Swain Of peevish Amaryllis to sustain The direful Anger and the proud Disdain? Better had I Menal[c]as made my Care? Tho' swarthy he; tho' thou as Lillies fair! Oh Youth! tho' bless'd with ev'ry blooming Grace, Trust not too much to thy inticing Face. White Blossoms from the Trees neglected fall, The black uncomely Berry's sought by all. Me you despise, Alexis! nor incline To know what Choice and plenteous Stores are mine; A thousand Lambs I call my own each Day, That scatter'd o'er Sicilian Mountains stray; Plenty of Milk in Summer fills my Pails, Not even in the Winter-Season fails; Nor sweet Amphion singing to his Herd, Cou'd be for Voice before myself prefer'd. Nor am I free from Grace, I lately stood, And view'd my Image in the briny Flood, When not a Breath of Wind disturb'd the Sea, Not Daphnis in his Form surpasses me, And him (thyself a Judge) I cannot fear, If like ourselves, our Images appear. Oh! that with me, you wou'd these Shades admire, And to our humble Cottages retire, Pursue the Harts, and to the verdant Boughs, Consent to drive the wanton Goats to brouze; To the delightful Groves confine your Will, And strive with me to rival Pan in Skill. Pan, first, the Shepherd's Pipe and Skill improv'd; By Pan the Sheep and Shepherds are belov'd; With the melodious Pipe thy Lip to gall, Grudge not, fair Youth! nor think it harm at all: What, that this pleasing Art he might have known, Wou'd not Amyntas willingly have done? A Pipe of seven unequal Reeds I have, That me of old, Dametas dying gave; Take this last Token of my Love, said he, And prosp'rous may it ever prove to thee, The Fool Amyntas did with Envy see. Beside two Kids, I in a Valley found Their Skins ev'n now with white are sprinkled round A Yew's swoln Udders twice they daily drain, And both for thee still carefully remain. Yet Thestylis to gain them often try's, And she at last may have the hop'd-for Prize, Why shou'd she not, since you my Gifts despise? Come hither fairest, dearest Youth! and see The lovely Presents here in Store for thee; Behold the courteous Nymphs in Baskets bring The choicest Beauties of the blooming Spring, For thy Delight, pale Lillies and the blue Soft Violets; the bright Narcissus too, To which they Heads of sleepy Poppies joyn, And Leaves of the sweet smelling Anethine. Then having nicely cull'd each chosen Flow'r, With each most fragrant Herb they dress thy Bow'r: I joyning too will here employ my Care, And downy Peaches for thy Tast prepare; To these I'll add Chessnuts the most approv'd, Such as my beauteous Amaryllis lov'd, And waxen Plumbs, a Fruit deserving Praise: Thou Myrtle! too I'll crop, and Laurel-Spraies, So plac'd, that both may grateful Scents dispence, And mingling fully, entertain thy Sence. Oh Coridon! thy clownish Gifts forbear, For thy mean Presents will Alexis care? Or were thy Off'rings ne'er so worthy; yet Wou'd J[ola]s in such to thee submit? What have I done? in mentioning that Name, How is my rash unwary Tongue to blame? A Southern Wind to blast my Flow'rs I bring, And plunge the Boars into the christal Spring! Whom fly you! frantic Youth? ev'n Gods have made With Joy their Dwellings in the Sylvan Shade; Here Trojan Paris liv'd: let Pallas go To Tow'rs that to her Art their Structure owe; There let the Warrior-Goddess proudly rest The peaceful Groves of all things please me best. Fierce Lionesses urg'd by strong Desire, Pursue He-Wolves to quench their raging Fire; The Wolves themselves with hungry Appetite Pursue the Goats; green Leaves the Goats invite, Thou me, Alexis! all things seek Delight. See Ev'ning comes; from Toils the Cattle cease, And by the setting Sun the Shades increase; Yet do's my Pain its lasting Fury prove: For oh! what Measure can be found in Love? Ah! Coridon! what wretched Frenzy's thine? Behold, at home, a tender blooming Vine Ly's half undress'd; haste thither, and apply To useful Things, lay fruitless Wishes by; If this Alexis scorns you, you may find Some other Youth to your Endeavours kind. CXVI THE THIRD PASTORAL The attribution of this poem is questionable. Dametas, Menalcas, Palæmon Menalcas Tell me, Dametas! whose'n Sheep these are: Do's Melibæus own them? Dametas No, my Care, Ægon employs; if you wou'd understand They're his late giv'n. Menalcas To an unhappy Hand; For while he courts Næera, fearing she Disdaining him, shou'd better think of me, To bribe her Favour from his Master's Store; Twice in an Hour he milks the Cattle o'er, And thus he drains the Moisture from the Damms, And of their Food defrauds the little Lambs. Dametas Yet softly thus to Elders; I know too, Pert Youngster! Who did you now? what with you; The rank He-Goats appear'd the Deed to blame, Turning their Heads another way for Shame; I noted well the sacred Place and Time, But th' easy Nymphs by laughing pass'd the Crime. Menalcas 'Twas when they saw this envious Hand of mine Break Micon's Shoots, and cut his tender Vine. Dametas Or at th' old Beachen Trees, when you thought fit To Daphnis here to set your manly Wit, Whose broaken Bow and Shaft, your Malice show'd, For when you saw them on the Boy bestowed, You griev'd, and from that time a Grudge you ow'd, And if your Spleen had not been satisfy'd, E'er this Menalcas! You had surely dy'd. Menalcas What shall we Masters do, when Varlets we Audacious find to such a high Degree? Did I myself not see you: Thou, most vile! (Lycisca, barking greatly all the while,) Attempt a Goat of Damon's to betray, And slily from the Flock to bear away? And when I cry'd Ho! where now flies he to? Tityrus! take care, observe your Cattle! you Did close behind the Hedges sneaking lie. Dametas Pray can you tell me, strict Accuser! why, When he in singing was by me out-done, He shou'd not yield the Goat I fairly won? The Goat you saw was mine (if you must know) Damon himself confess'd it to be so, But did deny he cou'd the Due bestow. Menalcas You him in singing! such a wond'rous Deed! Was you e'er Master of a waxen Reed? You Ignoramus! who on the high Ways Did use to squander miserable Lays, And with a tuneless Pipe and senseless Song Suit the dull Fancy of the gaping Throng. Dametas Then will you that we present Trial make Of both our Skills? This Heifer here I stake, Lest you refuse, and think the Prize too mean; Know in a Day, twice at the Pail she's seen, Two Young besides she nurses, Stripling! say What Wager now with me you chuse to lay? Menalcas As at this time my Circumstances are, To wager from the Flock, I do not dare, I have at home a Father, whom I fear, And a Step-Mother that is too severe, Twice in a Day, my Charge they numb'ring see, Both the grown Cattle, and the young ones he, But since the mad Man you're resolved to play, What yourself shall worthier own, I'll lay A Beachen Cup, with curious Carving grac'd, By spreading Vines and Ivy 'round embrac'd, Two Figures in the mid'st are neatly plac'd. Conon and what's his Name? The Man that drew The World and all its various People shew, The Times when Harvest shou'd begin and end; And when the Ploughman at his Task shou'd bend; The Work Divine Alcim[e]don's: I keep This up, as yet untouch'd by mortal Lip. Dametas And this Alcimedon, whom you have nam'd, Two Cups for me has in like manner fram'd; The Rims Acanthus twining do's embrace, The middle Part Orpheus appears to grace, And following Woods, the sweet Musician trace. These too, like you, with Care I hidden keep, Nor to their Edges yet have laid my Lip; Nevertheless, you'll small occasion find To praise the Cup, if you the Heifer mind. Menalcas No where shall you escape this live-long Day, Where e'er you slip, I'll follow strait away; Our Diff'rence now, let any fairly try; Let any Man be judge who passes by. See there Palæmon, from this time I shall Teach your bold Tongue more humble Words to all. Dametas Come on Pretender! and your utmost try, I'm ready, and the worst you can defy, Nor ever do I any basely fly. But, Friend Pal[æ]mon! ponder well withal Our present Cause; the matter is not small. Palæmon Then let your Skill be mutually express'd, While here upon the tender Grass we rest, The Trees now bloom, and each delightful Field Do's now its choicest Sights and Odours yield, Leaves crown the Woods, and in its Beauty's Prime, The Year now reigns; most lovely is the Time. Begin Dametas! and Menalcas! you Shall in alternate Strains his Steps pursue, Alternate Verses please the Muses too. Dametas Be your first Off'ring, Oh ye Muses! Jove's, Jove fills the World, and ev'rything improves; He gives us Plenty, and my Verses loves. Menalcas And me his Favour bright Apollo shows, His Gift the Laurel ever with me grows, He the sweet ruddy Hyacinth bestows. Dametas A wanton Lass, brisk Galatea, me With Fruit allures; then passes swiftly she And hides; yet wishes that I first shou'd see. Menalcas But scarce from me will kind Amyntas go, Who freely comes and haunts my Dwelling so, That not our Dogs, now Delia better know. Dametas My Venus soon shall have a Gift; for I Lately a Pidgeon's Nest observ'd on high, I mark'd the Place, and have it in my Eye. Menalcas Ten Wildings I have sent my lovely Friend, 'Twas what I cou'd; yet further I intend, Ten more to morrow carefully to send. Dametas How oft has Galatea bless'd my Ear? What has she say'd? ye gentle Breezes! bear Some Part to Heav'n, that all the Gods may hear! Menalcas Small is thy valu'd Kindness in this Case Amyntas! while the savage Boar you chace, I hold the Nets, nor view thy comely Face. Dametas Hither (for this is my Birth's joyful Day) Send Phillis, Jolas! and when I slay A Heifer for my Fruits, come thou thyself away. Menalcas Of all my Loves, fair Phillis is the Head, She Tears at my Departure kindly shed, And oh! a long Farewell fair Jolas! she said. Dametas To Folds the Wolf, winds to tender Tree, Show'rs to ripe Fruits most dreadful ever be, And Amaryllis when inrag'd to me. Menalcas The Moisture's lov'd by Grain that's newly sown Wean'd Kids to Shrubs, young are to Sallows prone, Amyntas is my Choice, and he alone. Dametas Pollio the Ditties of my rural Reed, My Verse tho' humble condescends to heed, A Heifer Muses! for your Reader feed. Menalcas And Verses freely flow from Pollio's Hand, Pollio himself the Muses do's command: Feed a fierce Bull that butts and spurns the Sand. Dametas Whom Pollio loves, may he all Pleasures know, Each where to him, let plenteous Honey flow, And prickly Thorns, Arabian Sweets bestow. Menalcas Who Ticko's empty Verse imagin's fine; Oh lib'ral Maurus! may be pleas'd with thine, The same may milk He-Goats and Foxes joyn. Dametas Ho, ye rash Boys! who here so heedless pry; For Strawberries and Flow'rs hence quickly fly, Lo! a fell Snake hid in the Grass do's lie. Menalcas My Sheep! forbear approaching, I advise, Who comes too near the Bark, not safely try's; For see the Ram his Fleece this instant dry's. Dametas My Goats, oh Tityrus! from the River bring, When Time shall make it a convenient Thing, I'll wash them all in yonder Chrystal Spring. Menalcas Boys! drive the Sheep to some protecting Shade, Lest, for their Milk, vain Trial shou'd be made; (Dry'd up thro' Heat) and we as late betray'd. Dametas How lean a Bull in a fat Field I view? This Love, alas! do's mortal Things undo, Ruins the Herd, the wretched Herdsman too. Menalcas These tender Lambs! their Misery ne'er sprung From Love, their Skins scarce on the Bones are hung, What evil Eye has thus bewitch'd my Young. Dametas Say in what Land the Heav'ns open lye Three Ells alone? (to the observing Eye,) And for thy Skill with great Apollo vye. Menalcas Say in what Land? if thou hast found declare, Where growing Flow'rs the Names of Monarchs wear, And from all Rivals lovely Phillis bear. Palæmon Me for a Judge, but illy you provide A Cause of so great Moment to decide, The Heifer both deserve, and all who fear A Love that's kind, or prove a too severe; Now let the River's running be restrain'd Enough, my Boys! this time the Meads have gain'd. CXVII THE FOURTH PASTORAL The attribution of this poem is questionable. Sicilian Muses! yet a higher Strain, Let's sing mean Shrubs and Bushes on the Plain, Delight not all; arise, and try to prove The Woods deserving of a Consul's Love. Now! now! the last auspicious Times behold, By the Cumean's sacred Verse foretold, A glorious Race of Ages is begun, And now springs forth successively to run; The Virgin now returns, and Saturn's reign Is to the joyful World restor'd again. See a new gracious Progeny descends From the high Heavens! at whose appearance ends This Iron Age, and a new golden Race, With ev'ry Virtue crown'd, assumes its Place. Oh chast Lucina! speed the glorious Birth, For now thy own Apollo reigns on Earth. And thou transcendant Infant! shall be born In Pollio's Rule! his Consulship adorn! Thence shall the wond'rous Time its Date begin, And thou our Guide, if of our former Sin Some Print remains, they shall be ras'd by thee, And Earth from Dread of future Guilt set free. He shall a God's exalted Life receive, And like the Gods and mingled Heroes live, Viewing and view'd by each, and Man's vile Race, Shall sway and alter with Paternal Grace. Thou Child! when born from the neglected Earth Choice Herbs and Flowers shall derive their Birth, With voluntary speed, She-Goats shall come, Their Udders stretch'd with Milk undriven home, And wand'ring Herds (no careful Keepers near) Securely feed, nor the grown Lions fear. To thee the Field its blooming useful Store Shall offer, baneful Herbs shall be no more, No more the lurking fiery Serpent's Sting Shall sudden and severe Destruction bring, In common Ways Assyrian Sweets shall spring; But when advanc'd in Years, thyself shall read Of Heroes Fame, and each paternal Deed, Extracting thence their Virtue's hopeful Seed, By soft Degrees the yellow-waving Corn Arising, shall th' extended Plains adorn; On Hedges purple Grapes in Clusters grow, And from hard Oaks delicious Honey flow. Yet still of ancient Fraud there shall remain Some Signs, and bold and greedy Men for Gain Shall tempt the Billows of the raging Main. Cities shall be with Walls begirt around, And the sharp Plough in Furrows tear the Ground. Another vent'rous T[iphy]s shall appear, An Argo its elected Heroes bear, New Wars and Sieges shall Mankind annoy, And great Achilles shall again to Troy. But when at full-grown Manhood thou shall be, The most successful shall renounce the Sea, The Ships shall sail for mutual Wares no more, But all things shall abound on ev'ry Shore, No Plough shall vex the Ground, nor Hook the Vine, The lab'ring Cattle shall the Yoke decline, Nor more forc'd painful Servitude shall know, Nor Wool its various Dyes dissembling show; But lordly Rams shall in the flow'ry Mead In Robes of native Purple proudly tread, And sweat beneath unborrow'd State, the Lamb Shall gaily prancing to its bleating Dam, Repair in Crimson that the lib'ral Field To grace the Wanton shall unsought for yield. The Parcæ shall with joynt Consent agree To keep thy Ages Thread from Mixture free, And when they have the happy Clue begun, Shall bid it smoothly and securely run. Advance! advance! thy Time is now at hand, Receive thy Honours and supream Command, Thou precious Offspring of the Gods above! Thou bless'd and vast Munificence of Jove! Behold the World by sinful Weight oppress'd, Inclines to yield; Earth, Sea, and Heav'n distress'd, Require thy Help: Lo! Nature lifts her Voice, And all things at th' approaching Age rejoyce! Oh wou'd my Life endure; cou'd I but raise My Skill to suit thy Due, thy lofty Praise; Tho' Thracian Orpheus did with me contend, Not Thracian Orpheus shou'd in Verse transcend, Nor Linus in sublimer Raptures fly, Tho' each had his Illustrious Parent by, Orpheus Caliope to grace his Song, Linus Apollo ever fair and young! Shou'd Pan ev'n in Arcadia vye with me, Ev'n in Arcadia Pan shou'd vanquish'd be! Begin, oh little Boy! with Smiles to know Thy Mother; this small Recompence bestow On her, who has ten tedious Months so late, With nauseous Ilness born thy growing weight. Begin, oh little Boy! with gracious Mind, Who smile not on their Parents ne'er shall find A courteous God at Board, in Bed, a Goddess kind. CXVIII THE FIFTH PASTORAL The attribution of this poem is questionable. Mopsus Menalcas Menalcas Oh Mopsus! since thus luckily we meet, Thou good to pipe, I Verses to repeat: Why sit we not in this delightful Shade, Which Hazles mixt with lofty Elms have made? Mopsus As you exceed in Years and Worth, to you I must Menalcas! give Precedence due, Whither a lovely Seat we chuse to take, Where wanton Zephyrs waving Shadows make, Or in yond Cave round which the clasping Vine, Loaden with Purple Grapes do's sweetly twine. Menalcas Amyntas only of our Mountain Swains, Presumes to equal thy delicious Strains. Mopsus And what if that bold Swain presume to do Yet more, and equal great Apollo too? Menalcas Mopsus! begin, if either Alcon's Praise, Or Loves of Phillis have employ'd thy Lays: Or wou'd you the Disputes of Codrus try? Begin, thy Goats shall brouze securely by, And Tityrus guard them with a watchful Eye. Mopsus No, but the Verses that I lately made, And on the Bark of a green Beech display'd, And nicely measur'd, and exactly weigh'd, I'll try; then let Amyntas, if he dare, The Skill you boast he has, with mine compare. Menalcas As much as Shrubs in Sight and Value yield To the pale Olives that adorn the Field, As the mean Swallow that neglected grows In Scent and Beauty to the blushing Rose. (If I may claim a proper Judge to be) So much Amyntas must submit to thee. Mopsus But now my Boy! thy Commendation wave, For see already we've approach'd the Cave. The pitying Nymphs thro' ev'ry Grove and Plain, Bewail'd th' untimely Fate of Daphnis slain, Did vast Regret and Lamentation show, Ye Hazles, and ye Streams, confess'd their Woe! When his dear Mother (most of all distress'd) His bleeding Corps in strict Embraces press'd, She did (with Rage and Sorrow fill'd) exclaim, And all the Gods and Stars severely blame; In those sad Days no lab'ring Swain for Drink Drove his fed Ox to the cool River's Brink: The Brooks were then by Cattles Feet unstain'd, And hung'ry Herds their needful Food disdain'd; That furious Lions, Daphnis! mourn'd thy Fate, The Woods and unfrequented Hills relate. By Daphnis taught Armenian Tygers drew The peaceful Chariot; Daphnis did renew The Rights of Bacchus and religious Chear, And deck'd with Ivy wreaths the trembling Spear. As spreading Vines o'er other Trees have Place In goodly Show, as them their Product grace: As lusty Bulls the lowing Herds adorn, And Fields are beautify'd by standing Corn, Thou wert the Grace of thine; in Sorrow due To thy sad Fate, ev'n from the Plains withdrew, Pales herself with great Apollo too. Where oft the golden Grain we us'd to strow Wild Oats and Darnel now insulting grow; Where once the soft blue Violet appear'd, And once its Head the Daffodilly rear'd, With mingled Scent and Beauty sweetly grew, Now Burs and bristly Thistles vex the View. Let Earth be strow'd with Leaves, and let a Shade Be o'er the Brooks and murm'ring Fountains made, Ye Shepherds! thus Daphnis himself commands, And claims this Service from your grateful Hands; Then to his sacred Memory with Care Erect a Tomb, and place these Verses there, ‘I Daphnis, known hence to the starry Sky, Kept a fair Flock, but fairer much was I.’ Menalcas Oh Bard Divine! thy Verses charm me so, Not they a more delicious Pleasure know, Who rest on tender Grass their weary Limbs, Or quench their raging Thirsts in running Streams. Thy Master's Skill thou hast not only gained With warbling Pipe, but with thy Voice obtain'd. Oh glorious Youth! each way compleatly bless'd, Equal to him thou shalt be now confess'd! Such as they are, I'll now repeat my Lays To thee, and Daphnis to the Stars we'll raise: Daphnis we'll place among the Stars, for he Good Will and Favour also bore to me. Mopsus Then such a Gift, what wou'd I rather chuse? The Youth was worthy of the choicest Muse: And Stimicon much my Desire has rais'd, Who to me lately these thy Verses prais'd. Menalcas The candid Daphnis th' unaccustomed Seat Of Heav'n surveys, and far beneath his Feet, Beholds the passing Clouds with vast Surprize, And num'rous Stars that glitt'ring grace the Skies; Therefore a mighty Transport fills the Plains, Pan and the rural Nymphs, and rustick Swains, And gen'rous Mirth each where unbounded reigns, Now prouling Wolves neglect their Rage and Wiles, The Net no more the tim'rous Deer beguiles; All Hatred, Fraud, and fierce Contention cease. Daphnis loves Leisure and the Joys of Peace. The high rough Hills to Heav'n their Voices raise, The hollow Rocks rejoycing sound his Praise. The very Shrubs advance his Name on high, And, oh Menalcas! he's a God, they cry. Then to thy own, oh! kind and gracious be, Four goodly Altars here erected see; Receive, oh Daphnis! Adoration due, Two Altars are thy Right, Apollo's Two; Two Bowls of Milk will I before thee lay, And two of Oil, a yearly Off'ring pay, And being first with gallant Chear supply'd. In cooling Shades in Summer's sult'ry Tide, In Winter's Season by the Fire's side! New Wine in plenteous Streams I'll pour to thee, That like the Liquor of the Gods, shall be, Dametas then a chearful Lay shall sing, And Lictius Egon make the Vallies ring: Alph[e]sibæus too shall featly trip In antic Jiggs, and like a Satyr skip. These things shall to thy Honour e'er be paid, When to the Nymphs our solemn Vows are made, And when of rural Gods we crave the usual Aid. While Boars on Mountains Tops delight to stray, While in the Silver Streams the Fishes play, While Grashoppers are fed with Morning Dew, And Bees their Toils in flow'ry Fields pursue. Thy Honour, Name and Praise with ev'ry Swain, Shall in Request eternally remain. As still to Bacchus and to Ceres we Offer our Vows; the Husbandman to thee, The fame with Zeal shall yearly give, and thou Shalt claim th' Observance of each offer'd vow. Mopsus What for such Lines, what Gift shall I bestow On thee, that my Esteem may fitly show? For not the coming of a Southern Breeze, That softly stealing Whistles thro' the Trees, Cou'd with its rustling Noise delight me more, Nor Billows striking on the sounding Shore, Nor Streams that trickle from a steepy Hill, And stony Vallies with their Murmurs fill. Menalcas But let me first a grateful Present make, This Pipe in Token of my Friendship take. Two Strains this taught me; Coridon the Fair Alexis lov'd, his Lord's delicious Care. And, tell Dametas! whose'n Sheep these are? Mopsus Take thou this Crook that from me oft in vain Antigenes, tho' lovely, strove to gain, Deserving not Menalcas! to be scorn'd, With equal Knots and shining Brass adorn'd. CXIX THE SIXTH PASTORAL The attribution of this poem is questionable. My Muse first sported with Sicilian Strains, Nor blush'd Thalia in the Woods and Plains To dwell, when aiming at sublimer Things, War's wastful Fury, and the Deeds of Kings; Apollo gently whisper'd in my Ear, And thus he said, rash Tityrus! beware, Sheep and low Strains best suit the Shepherd's Care. Thus, while oh! Varus! other Bards proceed To sing thy Fame, and tell each dreadful Deed, Inferior Aims provoke my Muse's Lays, And yet not wholly she despairs of Praise, While she ingraves on ev'ry Tree thy Name, While Varus! thee ev'n lowly Shrubs proclaim; For he whose Lines thy worthy Mention bear, Is sure of Phœbus the peculiar Care. Proceed, ye Muses, in his usual Guize Chromis and M[n]asylus by Chance surprize Silenus, in a Cave to sleep compos'd, With Fumes of yester's Wine and the God was doz'd: High hung his Pitcher old and in decay, And fall'n far off his rosy Garland lay; With Joy (for oft the Sire in vain believ'd, Had both the Youths with promis'd Verse deceiv'd). Approaching softly, they secure his Hands, With his own Wreath transform'd to sudden Bands. Herself to these the beauteous Ægle joyn'd A Nymph! the fairest of the wat'ry Kind; And as awak'd he casts around his Eyes, With Mulb'ry's Juice his Front and Temples dies. He smil'd at their Design; for what he said, For what Offence am I your Pris'ner made? Lose me, presumpt'ous Boys! without Delay, The promis'd Verses instantly I'll pay To you, the Nymph I'll please another way. He then began, and from the Woods and Lawns, A num'rous Croud of Satyrs and of Fawns Rejoycing come, ev'n savage Beasts attend, And stubborn Oaks their lofty Branches bend. Parnassus ne'er more joyfully restor'd The sounding Strains of its harmonious Lord, Nor Rhodope, nor Ismarus before At Orpheus's wond'rous Skill were ravish'd more, Than all things here united, did admire The high exalted Strains of this experienc'd Sire. He sung, how when thro' the vast Void compell'd, The Seeds of Earth, Sea, Fire, and Spirits held Their casual way, productive as they flew, All things from these their Forms and Beings drew, And hence the World's delightful Order grew! Then Earth appear'd, and hard'ning by Degrees, Rear'd its fair Head above surrounding Seas, With a young Offspring grac'd; the glorious Sun Then his ætherial Course began to run, And Clouds exalted o'er the Land, to pour The fruitful Blessing of a plenteous Shower; Then Woods arose and Beasts a lonely Way, (Few yet and Strangers) o'er the Mountains stray; Then Saturn's happy Reign the Song pursu'd, And how Man's Race was in the World renew'd. Prometheus's Theft and Punishment it nam'd, And how the parting Mariners exclaim'd For lovely Hylas, in the Fountain drown'd, While Hylas! Hylas! all the Rocks resound. And thou, Pasiphae! who a happy Queen Might have been stil'd, if Herds had never been, A snowy Bullock here thy Care do's prove, And has the Gift of thy unnat'ral Love. Ah! wretched Dame! in thee what Madness reigns? The Prætides, who roving fill'd the Plains With feigned Lowings, never did require Such Mates, nor burn'd with such a foul Desire, Tho' each for Horns explor'd her tender Brow, And fear'd the Yoke and Labour of the Plough[.] Ah, wretched Dame! thou do'st the Mountains pass In fruitless Search, while on the springing Grass Heedless he feeds, or else perchance is lay'd Beneath a spreading Oak's refreshing Shade, Or follows some fair Heifer of the Herd, Who is before unhappy thee preferr'd. Oh, all ye Nymphs! of ev'ry Stream and Grove, Bound, bound his Course, restrain his roving Love, With all your Might the careless Wand'rer stay, And to her longing Eyes the Fugitive convey. The Sire then sung the swiftly-running Maid Stopp'd in her speed, by golden Fruit betray'd, The Song did then the Sisters Fate display Of him, who rashly aim'd to rule the Day, Mourning his Lot, them sudden Barks inclose, And each with speed a weeping Alder grows. He sung how Gallus by a Muse convey'd A grateful Journey to Parnassus made, Rising to whom the sacred Choir express'd A full Respect, and Linus thus address'd. Receive this Pipe delicious Bard! he said, On which before th' Ascræan Shepherd play'd, Who did the Rage of Savage Beasts restrain, And charm the Mountain Ashes to the Plain; This the Grynæan Grove[']s arise shall tell, That Phœbus most may there delight to dwell. Why shou'd I either S[c]ylla's Tale relate? Or taught by Fame declare the latter's State? Who in the Sea a lov'ly Maid is plac'd, But barking Monsters rave beneath her Waste, That cause in passing Mariners such dread, And often on their broken Limbs are fed. How T[e]reus chang'd the various Song, express'd The Rape of Philomel the horrid Feast; How since in Woods sad Philomel complain'd, Progne (her Breast with filial Blood yet stain'd) Now hovers o'er the Palace where she reign'd. What e'er the God of Verse divinely thought, Eurotas heard, and to the Laurels taught Silenus sings, the Valleys all around In Ecchos to the Skies convey the Sound, Nor did the length'ned Song receive its End, 'Till driven Sheep did to the Cottage tend, And slow unwilling Night from Heav'n descend. CXX THE SEVENTH PASTORAL The attribution of this poem is questionable. Daphnis by Chance his Seat reposing took Beneath the Covert of a spreading Oak, And Coridon and Thyrsis thither led Their Flocks, that joyning now together fed: She-Goats fair fruitful Coridon did keep, The Charge of Thyrsis was his bleating Sheep, Both in their Prime! and both Arcadian Swains! Both apt and ready at alternate Strains. Now while I for my tender Myrtles made A Fence from Cold, unhappily had stray'd My Goat the Husband of the Flock, and I Seeking th' unlucky Truant Daphnis spy, When me again he had rejoycing spy'd, Hither, oh Melibæus! haste, he cry'd, Safe be thy Goats! and if Affairs permit, In this cool Shade a while, I prithee sit, Hither will come thy Bullocks thro' the Meads To drink, and here behold, with waving Reeds The River Mencius ouzy Banks are crown'd, And from the sacred Oak the murm'ring Bees resound. What shou'd I do in this Uncertainty? I had not Phillis, nor Alappe nigh, Who from the Call of their inviting Damms, Might now secure at home my weaned Lambs, And Numbers on the crowded Plain appear, These youthful Shepherds fam'd Dispute to hear; I idly too prefer their light Affairs Before my Bus'ness, and more serious Cares. The Shepherds then began to try their Skill In Strains alternate, which the Muses will, I shou'd remember; thus his Art each shows, These Coridon recites, and Thyrsis those. Coridon Ye lov'ly Muses! my Delight! incline To grant my Lays a Harmony divine; Like those of charming Codrus, let them be, Who is in worth Apollo! next to thee, Or if my Prayer unkindly is deny'd, My pipe shall on this sacred Oak abide. Thyrsis Arcadian Swains! around my Temples place An Ivy Wreath, that Codrus in Disgrace, May burst with Spight, or if malicious Praise From his ill Tongue, too high my Value raise: With Baccar bind my Brows (a sacred Charm) Your growing Poet to secure from Harm. Coridon This rough Boar's Head with Favour Delia! see, That little Micon now devotes to thee, Who do's with this submissively impart The branchy Horns of a long-living Hart, If this proves well, thou shalt be wholly plac'd Of smooth Punicean Stone, with Buskins grac'd. Thyrsis This Bowl of Milk and Cakes, Priapus! take, A slender Present, that I yearly make. Thy Care, my Garden is a little Spot, A Marble Statue therefore's now thy Lot; But if thy Blessing shall increase my Told, Thy Marble Statue shall be chang'd to Gold. Coridon Oh Galatea! sweeter far to me, Than Honey of the choice Hyblæan Bee, Whiter than Swans that swim the Chrystal Streams, And fairer than the clasping Ivy seems; If thou for Coridon hast kind Concern, Come! come! when ever my fed Bulls return. Thyrsis May I to thee more bitter seem than Rue, More course than Fuz, than Seaweed abject too, If this one day do's not to me appear, (To weary me) more tedious than a Year, Not yet suffic'd, what will ye ever feed? Hence ye gorg'd Bullocks! home, for shame, with speed. Coridon Ye murm'ring Fountains! and thou tender Glade! More soft than Sleep, thou sweet refreshing Shade! By you protected, let my Cattle shun The Summer's Heat that is ev'n now begun: Lo! Warmth ev'n now is in th' encreasing Year, And budding Gems upon the Vines appear. Thyrsis Here store of Fuel do's the Flames provoke, The Posts are blacken'd by continual Smoke; Here we the Rage of Boreas safely mock, As Wolves despise the Number of the Flock; Or, as the rapid Streams impetuous Force, The useless Bank that wou'd obstruct its Course. Coridon Here stands the Juniper! rough Chessnut grows, And Apples fallen from their loaded Boughs, Each where appear, the Fields with Joy are crown'd, And Mirth and Pleasure are dispens'd around; But from these Mountains shou'd Alexis go, Even the Rivers wou'd refuse to flow. Thyrsis The Sun with scorching Beams the Meadows fires, Thro' blasting Air the Verdure all expires, Ev'n Bacchus to his own denys his Aid, Nor yields the gen'rous Vine a needful Shade: When Phillis comes, will bloom the Trees and Flow'rs, And Rain descend in joyful plenteous Show'rs. Coridon The Poplar to Alcides grateful proves, The curling Vine gay youthful Bacchus loves, The Myrtle pleases well Love's beauteous Queen: Apollo likes his Laurel ever green; But while the Hazle, Phillis! is thy Care, None than the Hazle shall be thought more rare. Thyrsis The Ash in Woods do's ever fairest seem, The Pine in Gardens, Poplars by the Stream; The Firr of lofty Mountains is the Pride: But wou'd'st thou charming Lycidas! abide More often here, thy Grace my Boy! would be Far more conspicuous than the fairest Tree. Thus, Thyrsis did contend, but all in vain, Vanquish'd by Coridon, who on the Plain, Is since that Time our most applauded Swain. CXXI THE EIGHTH PASTORAL The attribution of this poem is questionable. Damon, Alph[e]sibæus Sad Damon's and Alph[e]sibæus Muse, At which the Herd admiring, did refuse Their needful Food, amaz'd the Lynxes stood, And the chang'd River sto[p]p'd its rapid Flood, The melancholly and the magic Strains Of these we'll sing, that charm'd the wond'ring Plains. And thou who do'st our rough Timavus awe, Or o'er th' Illyrian Seas extend thy Law, Shall ever come that Day's auspicious Date, When I thy glorious Actions shall relate? It shall, and I o'er all the World disperse Thy Praise, fit only for the tragic Verse Of Sophocles, take from my willing Hand, What now derives its Birth from thy Command; And 'round thy Temples let thy Ivy twine, And there with thy victorious Laurels joyn, For first and last my Labours shall be thine. Now scarcely from the dawning Skies withdrew The Shades of Night, and left expos'd to view, The tender Grass o'erspread with grateful Dew; When on a blasted Olive as reclin'd, Thus Damon utter'd his despairing Mind. Damon Haste Lucifer! the ling'ring Day constrain, While of false Nisa injur'd I complain, And call the Gods to testify my Woe; And tho' in vain my Rage and Grief I show, Unhelp'd, yet must I to my latest Hour Invoke them still, and blame Love's cruel Pow'r. Begin with me, while injur'd I complain, My mournful Flute! a soft Menalian Strain. Menalus has its Groves and speaking Pines, It ever to the Lover's Moans inclines; The shepherds['] kindly hears, great Pan is there, Who makes the tuneful Pipe his constant Care. Begin with me, while injur'd I complain, My mournful Flue! a soft Menalian Strain. Nisa to Mopsus is in Wedlock joyn'd, What may not Lovers now expect to find? Now Mares may match with Griffins void of Fear, And in succeeding Ages shall appear Mingling to drink, the Hound and tim'rous Deer. Haste, Mopsus! haste, and with officious Care Oh happy Man! the Marriage Rites prepare, Scatter the Nuts, thy Bride is present, see, And th' Evening Star do's Æta quit for thee. Begin with me, while injur'd I complain, My mournful Flute! a soft Menalian Strain. Of what a worthy Man art thou the Bride? Proud Maid? so full of Scorn for all beside, Who hate my Pipe and Goats, and so are scar'd At my rough Lip, and long bristly Beard. And think the Gods thy Business will allow, Nor more regard each mortal thing than thou. Begin with me while injur'd I complain, My mournful Flute! a soft Menalian Strain. I call to mind once with your Mother you Came to our Orchard; there I first did view Thy growing Charms, was your Conductor too. Then twelve Years old! my tender Arms cou'd stretch. Up to the Boughs, and nearest Apples reach, I gaz'd and dy'd! what Error did betray My Soul, and steal me from myself away? Begin with me, while injur'd I complain, My mournful Flute! a soft Menalian Strain. Now know I what is Love, the rugged North In Mountains, Rocks, or Desarts brought him forth; Or Ismarus, or [Rh]odope, sure fed Him young, or farthest Garamentes bred: His Birth or Breeding here he cou'd not find; Nor is he of our Blood or gentle Kind. Begin with me, while injur'd I complain, My mournful Flute! a soft Menalian Strain. Oh savage Love! by thy Instruction led, Her own dear Childrens Blood a Mother shed; This in the Mother was a cruel Deed, And impious Love the Cruelty decreed, Which of the two did most pernicious prove? Was she more cruel, or more impious Love? Impious was Love the Mother cruel too, Each in Extreme, and neither did out-do! Begin with me, while injur'd I complain, My mournful Flute! a soft Menalian Strain. From Sheep let Wolves now fly possess'd with Fear, Let Oranges on rugged Oaks appear, And ev'ry Alder the Narcissus bear. Let from mean Shrubs the choicest Honey flow, And hideous Owls of Swans the Rivals grow; Let rustic Tityrus Orpheus! change to thee; Let ev'ry Wood in him an Orpheus see, And let him with the Dolphins an Orion be. Begin with me, while injur'd I complain, My mournful Flute! a soft Menalian Strain. O'er all things let th' unbounded Ocean flow: Adieu, ye Woods! with sudden speed I'll go, And from some Mountain plunge into the Sea; Take thou this last and dying Legacy. Now cease with me, for I no more complain, Cease, my sad Flute! thy soft Menalian Strain. Thus, Damon his unhappy Fortune mourn'd, And what Alphesibæus then return'd, Ye Muses! to my Memory recall; For all things cannot be perform'd by all. Alph[e]sibæus Bring Water forth, and 'round this Altar twine Green Ivy, and the tender springing Vine, To these male Frankincense and Vervin joyn. That my lost Husband, I by Magic Skill May gain, and turn his Sences to my Will, Reduce the Wand'rer to his Nuptial Vow, All needful Things but Charms are present now. Bring from the Town my mighty magic Charms! Bring Daphnis home to my forsaken Arms. The mighty Force of magic Charms can make Ev'n the Moon her heav'nly Sphere forsake Circe by Charms transform'd Ulysses Friends, Their Force the deadly Snake to pieces rends. Bring from the Town my mighty magic Charms! Bring Daphnis home to my forsaken Arms. This Ribbon of three divers Hues I wind Three times about, then to thee first, thus bind, And 'round this Altar thrice this Image bear; Odd Numbers to the God delightful are. Bring from the Town my mighty magic Charms! Bring Daphnis home to my forsaken Arms. Make Amaryllis! make immediately, Three Knots of various Colours each, and cry, I th' everlasting Bonds of Venus tye. Bring from the Town my mighty magic Charms! Bring Daphnis home to my forsaken Arms. As now by one and the same Fire this Clay Grows harder, and this Wax dissolves away, Such thorough me, let perjur'd Daphnis prove, So let him harden and dissolve with Love; Besprinkle Meal, and then with Brimstone fire These Laurel Leaves, as magic Rites require; Daphnis inflames my Soul, and in return Against false Daphnis, I this Laurel burn. Bring from the Town my mighty magic Charms! Bring Daphnis home to my forsaken Arms. As a stray Bullock thro' the Woods do's go Weary and wand'ring, and oppress'd with Wo; At last in vain attempting many Ways, Himself despairing on the Grass, he lays, By frequent Lowings mourns his lost Estate, Not knowing whither to return, tho' late. Let wand'ring Daphnis such Distress endure, Nor from my Hands obtain a needful Cure. Bring from the Town my mighty magic Charms! Bring Daphnis home to my forsaken Arms. These Garments (sometimes worn) perfidious he Dear Pledges of himself bequeath'd to me, These now beneath this Threshold I bestow In thee, oh Earth! these Pledges Daphnis owe. Bring from the Town my mighty magic Charms! Bring Daphnis home to my forsaken Arms. This Poison, and these Herbs that vastly grow In Pontus, Mæris did on me bestow; By such a Wolf I've seen him oft become, Then hide in Woods, and from the dismal Tomb, The ghastly Scepter often make appear, And often Fields of Corn with Fury rear, And into other Fields transplanting bear. Bring from the Town my mighty magic Charms! Bring Daphnis home to my forsaken Arms. Bring Ashes Amaryllis! forth with speed, Then mark which way the flowing Stream do's lead, And with it backwards cast them o'er thy Head. Look not behind; thus Daphnis, I'll surprize, He scorns the Gods, and all my Charms defies! Bring from the Town my mighty magic Charms! Bring Daphnis home to my forsaken Arms. See, of their own accord (while I delay To bear them hence) the Coals new Flames display, Which trembling from the Altar now ascend, It shou'd, I think, some prosp'rous thing portend: I know not certainly the Meaning; hark, Our Hylax at the Door begins to bark; Do we vain Lovers, but ourselves deceive By Dream, or may I what I wish believe? Now cease! now cease! my mighty magic Charms! Daphnis returns to my desiring Arms. CXXII THE NINTH PASTORAL The attribution of this poem is questionable. Lycidas, Mæris Lycidas Whither away, my Friend! ho! Mæris! ho! This leads to Town, say whither dost thou go? Mæris Oh Lycidas! how are our Hopes deceiv'd? Things are as once we cou'd not have believ'd; All is my own, the rugged Souldier says, Hence ancient Rustics! march with Speed your Ways. Forc'd to submit, yet with a heavy Heart (For Fate and Force change all things) we depart, And these two Kids t' appease his furious Mood Now send; and may they never do him Good. Lycidas I'm sure, I heard from where these Hills ascend, And their mean Summits gently sloaping bend, As far as thence the passing Eye can reach, Ev'n to the Water and the broken Beach; All your M[e]nalcas had secur'd from Wrong, And safely guarded by his charming Song. Mæris 'Twas so reported, but alas! what Charms Have Verses Lycidas! for martial Arms? Here all the Muses gentle Graces fail, As Doves must fly when furious Hawks assail, And had not from a hollow Holm, the Crow On the left hand forewarn'd me to forego All new Debates; not Mæris on this Plain Had been, and our Menalcas had been slain. Lycidas How? cou'd in any so much Baseness be? Were all our Comforts almost lost with thee? Thou dear Menalcas! who the Nymphs shou'd sing? Who strow the Ground with blooming Herbs, or bring Delightful Shadows o'er the chrystal Spring? What Verses lately did I slily view, And softly read, as little heeding you Near to my darling Amaryllis drew. ‘Oh Tityrus! going hence a little way, ‘Let not my Goats 'till my returning stray, ‘But feed them near this gentle River's brink, ‘When fed, then drive them to the Flood to drink, ‘And driving them along yourself take care, ‘And of the rough He-goat who Butts beware. Mæris Ay! or what he to Varus did repeat, Which th[o'] imperfect I remember yet, Varus! if Mantua keeps from Ruine clear; ‘(Mantua to sad Cremona, ah! too near) ‘The Swans sweet Voices shall declare thy Fame, ‘And to the Stars exalt thy glorious Name. Lycidas So may thy Bees from harmful Yews be freed, So may thy Cows within the flow'ry Mead Their Udders fill, and ever safely feed. If thou hast ought begin, the Muse has shown, Ev'n me some Favour, I some Verses own: The Shepherds call me Poet, but I know I merit not the Title they bestow; Aim not at Varus, nor at Cinna's Ear, But like a gabling Goose among the Swans appear. Mæris 'Tis Lycidas! what now imploys my Mind, And I am aiming secretly to find, Which, if I can remember, I'll rehearse, Nor is it worthless or ignoble Verse. ‘Haste hither Galatea! what Delight ‘Can in the raging Deep thy Stay invite? ‘Here blooms the purple Spring in all its Pride, ‘And sweetly by the curling River's side: ‘The bounteous Earth distributes various Flow'rs, ‘Here woven, compose delicious Bow'rs; ‘The Poplar too in lov'ly green array'd, ‘Yields to the Cave both Gracefulness and Shade. ‘Haste hither! let the Billows vainly roar, ‘And madly beat on the resounding Shoar. Lycidas Say what I heard you sing one Night alone, The Tune I yet retain, the Words are flown. Mæris ‘Daphnis! regard not any ancient Sign, ‘Lo! Cæsar's Star do's now proceeding shine; ‘This shall to Corn and Fruits Perfection give, ‘And make the luscious Grape its purple Hue receive. ‘Now Daphnis! on thy Fruits employ thy Care, ‘Thy Childrens Children shall the Blessing share. Time conqu'ring all things do's our Minds destroy, I well remember when I was a Boy, My Voice at my Command wou'd sweetly run, And oft sing down a lingring Summers Sun; Now I forget, my Voice, as it has been, Is nothing too, Wolves first have Mæris seen; But all these things, and more than I forget Menalcas to thee often will repeat. Lycidas You by Excuse, but my Desire increase, And lo! to thee, now Ocean's Murmurs cease, And ev'ry Wind is gently hush'd to Peace. We're now half Way, for lo! before our Eyes, Bianor's Sepulchre begins to rise. Let's sit and sing in this refreshing Shade, That with green Boughs the lab'ring Hinds have made, Let us, I prithee, rest a while, lay down Thy Kids, we'll yet be time enough at Town; Or if you fear e'er Night the coming Rain, Let's go together singing o'er the Plain, 'Twill seem by far more short and easy Way, As thus we spend the time, and that we may Go thus together singing on the Road, I'll lend my help to ease thee of thy Load. Mæris Cease now my Boy! and our Affair let's Mind When e'er he comes, plenty of Songs we'll find. CXXIII THE TENTH PASTORAL The attribution of this poem is questionable. Oh Arethusa! this my last Work aid, Some Verses for my Gallus must be made, And what Lycoris may herself peruse, Who for the sake of Gallus can refuse His proper Right, the Tribute of a Muse? So may thy Stream beneath Sicania's Sea, In everlasting Ease and Safety be, Nor Doris mix her briny Waves with thee. Then let's begin, and while my Goats (my Care) Securely feed; oh! Gallus! We'll declare Thy anxious Love, we sing not quite in vain, The Groves shall answer to the mournful Strain. Ye wat'ry Nymphs! what Woods or Mountains strove To check your Help, when Gallus thus did prove The fatal Victim of unworthy Love? Parnassus never had your Course withstood! Nor Pindus high! nor Aganippe's Flood! Ev'n from the Laurels trickling Tears distill'd, And flowing Grief the Shrubs and Bushes fill'd, Pine-bearing Menalus Compassion felt, And Stones of cold Lycæus seem'd to melt, As stretch'd beneath a lonely Rock he lay, The straggling Sheep around their Master stray. Oh Bard divine! think it not shame to keep, Like us on humble Plains the fleecy Sheep, His snowy Flocks the fair Adonis fed, And unrepining to the River led. Upilio and the Neat-herds thither drew, And smear'd with Winter-Mast Menalcas too, All shew'd Concern, and whence arose thy Flame, With Pity ask'd, to thee Apollo came. Gallus! what Madness fills thy Mind, (he cries) Thy false Lycoris with another flies To distant Realms, and unrelenting go's Thro' horrid Wars and everlasting Snows! Sylvanus came, and on his Head was fixt A Fennel Wreath, with quiv'ring Lillies mixt. Pan came Arcadia's God, (by us descry'd) His Cheeks and Temples were with Crimson dy'd, Says he, what measure can in Love be shown? Not Love as yet has any Measure known! Fierce Love to flowing Grief no Bounds allows, As Goats are ne'er suffic'd with verdant Boughs! As Bees are ne'er suffic'd with Store of Flow'rs, Or rising Grass with Streams or frequent Show'rs. He mourning, thus reply'd, Arcadian Swains, Record my Fate in your melodious Strains, This let your Hills resound, your Songs alone Are fit to make the Dying's Sorrow known! How wou'd my Bones enjoy more perfect rest, If by your Pipes my Passion was express'd? And oh! that Fate had me like you decreed To dress the Vines, or bleating Flocks to feed; That I had been on the delightful Plain, A chearful Shepherd of your tuneful Train: To Phillis, or Amyntas made my Court, Or any other of the rural sort, Tho' brown or black, they yet might yield Delight, Not Violets, nor Berries please the Sight! Among the Sallows and the Vines we'd lay'd Our careless Limbs, and innocently play'd; Phillis had crown'd my Head with Wreaths of Flow'rs, With pleasing Songs Amyntas bless'd the Hours. By these cool Fountains! in these shady Groves! (The proper joyful Scene of mutual Loves) In these soft Meadows so profusely gay! With thee Lycoris! cou'd I chuse to stay, And well-delighted pass an Age away! Now frantic Love keeps me in horrid Arms, Expos'd to War's fierce Rage and hostile Harms, While most unkindly and perversly you (Nor am I willing to believe it true) Over the lofty Alps perpetual Snow To Rhenus's Coasts and dreary Regions go, Ye bleaky Winds! your wonted Rigour spare; Ah! hurt not, vex not the too vent'rous Fair, And thou sharp Ice! her tender Limbs forbear. I'll go, and with Sicilian Pipe rehearse My once compos'd, yet long-neglected Verse, Amidst the Dens of savage Beasts I'll be, And carve my Flame on ev'ry tender Tree, The lonely Wilds my hopeless Love shall know, And as the Trees increase, the Love shall grow. Then Menalus, I'll tred with eager Pace, And mixing with the Nymphs, pursue the Chace, Or hunt wild Boars, nor sharpest Colds shall stay My steps, as 'round Parthenian Hills I stray. And now, methinks, with op'ning Hounds I fly Thro' sounding Woods that echo to their Cry; Over Cydonia's Plains and Mountains go, Rush thro' the Brakes, and bend the Parthian Bow, As if such Toils cou'd cure my painful Mind, Or any chosen Way the Means cou'd find, Oh rigid Pow'rs of Love! to calm thy Rage, Or human Ills thy Fierceness cou'd asswage. And now my Thoughts (averse to all of these,) Not Nymphs, nor Woods, nor charming Strains can please: The cruel God our Labours cannot change, Not tho' o'er Thrac[i]a's bleaky Realms we range, To Heber's frozen Waters shiv'ring go, In depth of Winter press Sithonia's Snow, Or when the Sun do's to the Scales incline, Drive our scorch'd Flocks beneath the Tropic Line. The World is with his Pow'r and Presence fill'd, Love conquers all, and we to love must yield! Here cease ye sacred Muses! nor prolong Beyond due Limits the devoted Song, These mournful Verses, shall to Gallus prove A grateful Token of my zealous Love, My Love to Gallus! that do's hourly show Increasing Force as springing Alders grow. Now let's arise! for often by the Shade, The Singer's Voice is hoarse or feeble made; The Shades of Junipers unwholsome are, Shades hurt the Fruits, 'tis Ev'ning[,] leave your Fare, Ye fill'd She-goats, and to your home repair. CXXIV A PINDARIQUE ODE Written in a Garden The attribution of this poem is questionable. I Blest Shade! where I securely stay, And taste the Fragrance of the Plain; Which wanton Zephyr does convey In his refreshing Play, To chear the panting Flock, and panting Swain. Here on this flow'ry Carpet laid, By Nature's Hand, in Nature's Pride array'd; My Soul, unus'd to balmy Ease, By Sympathy at Rest, Is lull'd within my Breast, Unhurt by Care or Sorrow's worse Disease. II So have I seen the warb'ling Lark, When Winter's cheerless Frosts were o'er, And noisy Bear has ceas'd to roar, The Day no longer cold, nor dark, The narrow Compass of a Cage forget, And broadling o'er a Turf, in silent Pleasure sit. Here Solitude and gentle Ease combine To give a Taste of Joy divine; Here every Object seems design'd, Whither thro' blooming Groves or flow'ry Meads we stray, To drive Anxiety away, And help Philosophy to cure the Mind. III With Joy I hear the tuneful Choir, Which now are hov'ring o'er my Head; Whilst I beneath supinely spread, Their various Notes, and little Cares admire: The Bird that sits upon this Bough, Fearless by me to be distress'd, Pursues the Building of her Nest; Sure she by Instinct knows me now: But my harmonious Friend, beware, In me tho' safely you confide, Thy Nestlings for the future hide; All are not gentle, nor thy Work would spare. IV I feel, ah! lovely Seats, I feel your Influence, That native Truth, and Innocence, Which liv'd, e'er Virtue was deprav'd by Sense; E'er momentary Trifles, transient Joy, Did Man's Posterity destroy; E'er foul Oppression had its Rise, When all was blissful Paradise, Before the Birth of Law, or its curs'd Parent Vice. Oh! Let me here, kind Fate, remain Upon this harmless, happy Plain; Secure of peaceful Virtue and Content, In no inglorious Ease and Banishment. V The Sun withdraws his genial Ray, And reddens in the Western Sky; The wand'ring Rooks do Homeward fly, And, 'till the Morn appears, forsake the Prey The Nightingale her mournful Story trills In yonder Hawthorn Shade; The Bleating Sheep are laid; And on the Earth the nightly Dew Distills: The Shepherd hasts to sound Repose, Such sleep the Guilty never knew; 'Till Phœbus shall again his Beams disclose, Blest Solitude, Adieu. CXXV THE FALL The attribution of this poem is questionable. I As Chloe o'er the Meadow past, I view'd the lovely Maid; She turn'd and blush'd, renew'd her Haste, And fear'd by me to be embrac'd, My Eyes my Wish betray'd. II I trembling felt the rising Flame, The Charming Nymph pursu'd; Daphne was not so bright a Game, Tho' Great Apollo's Darling Dame, Nor with such Charms endu'd. III I follow'd close, the Fair still flew Along the Grassy Plain, The Grass at length my Rival grew, And catch'd my Chloe by the Shoe, Her Speed was then in vain. IV But Oh! as tott'ring down she fell, What did the Fall reveal? Such Limbs Description cannot tell, Such Charms were never in the Mall, Nor Smock did e'er conceal. V She shreik'd, I turn'd my ravish'd Eyes, And burning with Desire, I help'd the Queen of Love to rise; She check'd her Anger and Surprize, And said, Rash Youth, retire. VI Be gone, and boast what you have seen, It shan't avail you much; I know you like my Form and Mien, Yet since so insolent y'have been, The Parts disclos'd you ne'er shall touch. CXXVI TO PHILLIS: WHO SLIGHTED HIM The attribution of this poem is questionable. Since you no longer will be kind, But my Embraces shun, Bacchus shall ease my am'rous Mind, To his embrace I run. Wine gives a Pleasure unrestrain'd, Dispells the frantick Spleen; Tho' Wishes cannot be attain'd, Looks still are joyful seen. The God within his gladsome Cave No Care nor Grief allows; He laughs to Scorn the Sober, Grave, And Sighing Lover's Vows. Then, Phillis, do whate'er you can, I dully will not pine, I'll ne'er forget I am a Man, But seek my Cure from Wine. That sullen Look, and hasty Kiss, That Air reserv'd and coy; That cold Denial of the Bliss Shall not my Ease destroy. If you no more can love like me, Why should it give me Pain? Frail Woman will inconstant be, Nor Art their Will can chain. As well I might cross Winds deplore, At rising Tempests rave, As hope a wav'ring Mind to cure; Nature its Course will have. Then welcome more enduring Joys, Long shall my Doctor be, A Club of Witty, Toping Boys, And Love, adieu to thee. CXXVII SOPHRONIA'S ANSWER TO A COXCOMB The attribution of this poem is questionable. I Satisfy your self, fond Youth, I can believe you love; I know the Charms of Wealth and Youth Are Charms which you approve[.] II Regardless of my Wit, and Mind, With Truth and Virtue fraught, To meaner Beauties you are kind, By Lust or Int'rest taught. III But know, the Person I shall choose, Must have a Taste like mine; I never shall consent to loose The Charms in which I shine. IV To other Nymphs your Vows address, Your sordid Accents, prate Of Airs, Complexion, Mien and Dress, And cringe your empty Pate. V You're handsome, fine, can caper, sing, Of Coxcombs lead the Van; Yet have not Sense, the only thing, That I can like in Man. CXXVIII TO CLARISSA Upon dirtying her Lodgings The attribution of this poem is questionable. Dust from my earthy Surface fell, And soil'd the fair Clarissa's Cell; Clarissa's Eyes have Pow'r Divine, And with uncommon Lustre shine; I'm form'd of sordid Earth, which must, When shin'd upon, be turn'd to Dust; This Phœbus meaner Force can do, Who is not half so bright as You; Be not severe then in your Doom, Since from your Self my Fault did come; 'Twas Wonder, when so near the Ray, I did not moulder quite away; She smiles, forgives; I feel the Pain, Be angry, Charming Nymph, again; Better to dye, than thus endure What, You, ah Cruel! will not cure. CXXIX A Lady, asking the Author's Opinion of two Gentlemen, her Lovers, occasioned the following LinesThe attribution of this poem is questionable. With decent Carriage, and an artful Stile, The prudent Cynthio does the World beguile, And hides the Satyr underneath the Smile. Not so Astolpho, gen'rous and sincere, He ne'er at common Failings is severe; Open his Words, and undisguis'd his Soul, He let's no trifling Humour spoil the Whole: Ne'er sooths the harmless Foibles of Mankind, Vainly, inhumanly, to laugh behind; Wisely, at nobler Merit, he aspires, And more the Name of Man, than Wit desires. Teach me, kind Heav'n, to make so good a Choice; Let Truth alone inspire an honest Voice: Far from me keep the frothy Part of Wit; Let me be dull,—but not an Hypocrite. CXXX SONGThe attribution of this poem is questionable. I Unveil, divinely Fair, your Eyes, And from the downy Bed arise; Ah! did you Strephon's Love partake, You would not sleep, but ever wake. II Hence, hence, dull God of Sleep, away, Let my Celinda bless the Day: Insensibly, you close those Eyes, At whose each Look, a Shepherd dyes. CXXXI SONGThe attribution of this poem is questionable. I Since Wine, Love, Musick, present are, Let's banish ev'ry Doubt and Care; This Night is ours, and we'll enjoy, To Morrow shall not Now destroy. II Let us indulge the Joys we know Of Musick, Wine and Love; We're sure of what we find below, Uncertain what's above. CXXXII SONGThe attribution of this poem is questionable. I Young Strephon, who thro' ev'ry Grove, Had chas'd the fleeting God of Love, Met Hymen once, who cross'd his Joy, And chain'd the Am'rous Captive Boy. II Happy the Swains, who only stray Where Love and Pleasure lead the Way; Where Hymen's Arts can never move, And Love receives no Tye, but Love. CXXXIII SONGThe attribution of this poem is questionable. I Why flies Clarissa from her Swain, Regardless of Desire? The Wanton sees his Pain, And, of the Conquest vain, Derides the Love-sick Fire. II Beware, ah! Cruel! Tempt not Fate, Nor with Love's Arrows Toy; Tho' now unhurt, Elate, You'll surely find, too late! There's Danger in the Boy. CXXXIV THE MINOUET A Song The attribution of this poem is questionable. I My lovely Charmer, will you Dance With Strephon, your obedient Slave; She look'd the kind consenting Glance, And then her snowy Hand she gave. II The Youth with Joy the Nymph receiv'd, And gently press'd her tender Palm, 'Till Musick's Sound the Hand reliev'd, And robb'd him of his healing Balm. III The Am'rous Swain, thro' eager Haste, Both Time and Measure did disdain: Twice careless, he the Figure trac'd, And snatch'd the snowy Hand again. IV The blushing Maid his Flame approv'd, And with like gen'rous Passion mov'd, Again, they round the Figure glow'd, Then turn'd, and curtsy'd; Strephon bow'd. CXXXV THE TOPER A Song The attribution of this poem is questionable. I Let's Tope and be Merry, Be Jolly and Cheary; Since here is good Wine, good Wine. Let's laugh at the Fools, Who live by dull Rules, And at us Good-Fellows repine. II Here, here, are Delights, To amuse the dull Nights, And equal a Man with a God; To enliven the Clay, Drive all Care away, Without it a Man's but a Clod. III Then let us be willing To spend t'other Shilling, For Money we know is but Dirt; It suits no Design, Like paying for Wine, T'other Bottle will do us no hurt. CXXXVI VENUS AND ADONIS: OR THE AMOUR OF VENUSThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Omnia vincit Amor ? Virgil. In Ida's Grove a secret Place there lies, That seems secure from Man's and Heav'n's Eyes: No raging Heat but Love's cou'd this invade Ever protected by a grateful Shade With rising Grass the plenteous Earth is Spread, And various Flowers form a fragrant Bed: Close by a softly-stealing Stream complains, As if it self endur'd a Lover's Pains. Around the Turtles, gently moaning seem, And mix their Murmurs with the purling Stream. Venus distress'd in Pallaces above, Found no Content while absent from her Love; The Residence of Gods cou'd yield no Joy, Without the Presence of the lov'ly Boy: She therefore left Heav'n's Courts (oppress'd with Cares,) And to this humble, quiet Seat repairs. Here now she seeks (her Comfort and Delight,) The Youth, who must each soft Regard requite; But ah! No Youth appears to bless her Sight. The appointed Time was pass'd, th' exalted Sun To th' utmost Summit of his Course was run; Yet still Adonis, with an eager Pace, Thoughtless of Heat, or Rest, pursues the Chace; Thoughtless of Danger, or her kind Embrace. But She (in whom nothing can Love controul Love! The sole Joy and Essence of her Soul,) Full of Desire, cannot her self contain, But thence as Winds sweep o'er the stormy Main, She swiftly springs . . . stops ev'ry Nymph and Swain, Some Tidings of the ling'ring Boy to know, And where, and how employ'd, and why so slow? Her Voice and Eyes, and eager Steps proclaim The fierce Impatience of the heav'nly Dame. So flies the wounded Deer along the Plains, Seeking Redress . . . while of its cruel Pains, The fatal Cause fixt in it's Side remains. To ev'ry Hill that a far Prospect makes Thro' pathless Ways, a desp'rate Flight she takes, In frantick Mode, her loose dishevell'd Hair, Toss'd by the Winds, her Limbs expos'd and bare, Careless of Beauties that so meanly charm, And heedless in his Cause of ev'ry Harm. Much Pains th' impatient Goddess dos' imploy In fruitless Search of the neglectful Boy. Weary'd at length with Toil, and faint with Heat, Repairs again to her cool shady Seat, Hoping in Sleep's inviting Arms to find A Solace, to relieve her harrass'd Mind, And faint Idea of that Bliss to gain, For which, she waking fought so much in vain. Now, now to needful Rest she's softly lay'd In the Recess of the most secret Shade, The ravish'd Earth, it's grassy Carpet spreads, And new sprung Flowers nod their fragrant Heads. Twine round her Limbs, and grateful Odours give; But far more grateful Odours thence receive. The Breezes ev'ry part with Kisses greet, And by those Kisses make their Breaths more sweet; The Trees in circling Crouds behold the Sight, And shake their leafy Limbs, and tremble with Delight. The curling River in a vast Amaze, Restrains his murmuring Flood, and stops to gaze; Transported, views the Grace of ev'ry Limb, And grasps its dear Resemblance in his Stream. Each am'rous Turtle far more am'rous grows, And in tumultuous Moans its Passions shows[.] Her heavenly Charms all but Adonis fire, Whole Nature sees with Wonder and Desire! The little Love's in silent, solemn State, With due Obedience on the Goddess wait, Part guard, Her sleeping with the strictest Care, The Rest to seek the Darling Youth prepare. Thus Venus do's her ardent Mind employ The dear, the beauteous, wild, and wand'ring Boy, Tho' shy t' embrace, tho' careless yet t' enjoy: At least some fancy'd Blessing to procure From Hind'rance, and from Interruption sure. But ah! No cautious Dealing can delude Close Envy, nor her jealous Sight exclude: For whom shou'd simple Love securely blind, Contrive, or act what Envy cannot find? She slily lurking, this Intrigue do's know, Disclosing all to Love's severest Foe. And now th' abstemious Goddess of the Groves, Cruel Diana, conscious of their Loves, With Fury burns, and to pursue her Hate, Had search'd the Volume of eternal Fate; (For Fate all Actions sways, his Laws confine, All aims, and curb even the Pow'rs Divine.) Its brazen Leaves all Mortals Dooms comprize In Characters of various Hue and Size; The smaller still each happy Doom express, Which human Malice (as it can) makes less A sanguine Dye, and sullen Black unfold The bad . . . . the Prosp'rous are display'd in Gold, So deeply writ, that neither Force nor Skill Can fully raise Them, both the good and ill Slow Care, Discretion and Advice are by, And all the bad t' abolish vainly try. Here for Adonis's Doom the Goddess pry's With dire Intent . . . and while her Hands and Eyes, With Expedition, yet with Caution move, She finds the Pages of disastr'ous Love. There sees his sudden Lot in sanguine Hue, Engraven deep, the Characters yet new. And scarcely dry, the woful Deed reveal, And seem an Image of the Case they tell, How in small Time assaulting on the Plain A furious Boar, the Hunter shou'd be slain. At this well pleas'd, she smil'd, and cry'd Caress, Thy Youth, fond Venus! thy Delight possess; But short's th' allotted Time, and I the Joy Of that short time shall labour to destroy. This said, with furious Haste the Path she trod, (And Mind with Vengeance fraught) to sleep's abode, There took a Fantom from the drowsy God. Fram'd like Adonis, in that dismal State, To which he quickly must be doom'd by Fate. This Envy had in Keeping to convey With speed to where expecting Venus lay. And now soft Sleep with welcome sweet Surprize Approaching Venus shuts her radiant Eyes; Yet ah! full Conquest anxious Thought denies, By sudden Fits she shakes it from her breast With fearful sad prophetick Dreams oppress'd. No sooner had soft Slumber seiz'd the Dame, (Ever within her Thoughts) Adonis came, But how surprizing! How unlike the same? His Eyes distorted! stupid! gastly! stare, Pale were his Cheeks, and clotted was his Hair; His feeble Limbs with Dirt besmeer'd around, And Blood in Streams flow'd from a direful Wound: From's Lips Words broken and imperfect, fell, Some mournful Tale, he stamm'ring, seem to tell, He sigh'd, and bad eternally Farewel. Th' astonish'd Goddess vast Endeavours made To grasp the dear, the lovely, dismal Shade: But all alas! were vainly loss'd in Air, Waking, she finds no sad Resemblance there. O'er all the gloomy Grove with Care she pry'd, But when no true Adonis she descry'd, Again, t' inviting Sleep her self resign'd; Again, the gastly Vision haunts her Mind: Again, with Blood and Dirt obscene appears: Again, the dismal long Farewel she hears: Then, rising puts the horrid Dreams to Flight, And frees her from the dire distracting Sight: But oh! th' Impression still remains behind, And with vast Doubts and Fears, torments her Mind. As grievous Cares the Tender Mother seize, Who from her Arms, and such indulgent Ease, Her Life's Delight! her Age's Hope! for Gain, Her only Son! has ventur'd on the Main. When told by Fame, that on some rocky Coast, The hapless Youth with all his Wealth is loss'd; Such now of Venus seems the wretched Case; Such weighty Grief in her sad Mind takes Place. But now the Loves (by ranging all around,) The long'd-for and lamented Youth had found; And by his Side, in close Attendance came, And introduc'd him to the wishing Dame: Upon the dear delicious Boy she fly's, As swift as Lightning flashing from the Skies, Or as the Glances of her brighter Eyes: Her circling Arms upon his Neck she flung, And with fixt Kisses on his Lips she hung. A while the Transport of the present Joys, All Thought of future, or of pass'd destroys; But when her Flame (that Grief more raging made) By softest Dalliance was in Part allay'd, Reflecting on her Dream, she silence broke, And sighing thus, the tempting Goddess spoke: Forbear, regardless Youth! at length forbear; Nor prosecute with Beasts an endless War, Thy Venus do's in all the Danger share. Or, if, alas! thy too licentious Mind Is still to vig'rous Sylvan Sports inclin'd, At least, dear Youth! be cautious in thy Way, Fly! fly with Care each furious Beast of Prey; Ne'er arm'd with Launce provoke the raging Boar, And dread the Lion's most tremendous Roar: From the rough Bear's rude Grasp, oh! swiftly run, The Leopard, and the cruel Tyger shun; With strict Regard, oh! ever such avoid, Lest all my Joy shou'd be with thee destroy'd: But Nets, or fleetest Hounds for Deer prepare, Or chace the crafty Fox, or tim'rous Hare: Mix Safety ever with thy Sports, be wise, And ne'er approach where Danger may arise. For oh! a dismal Dream, portending Ill, Do's all my Soul with wond'rous Horror fill; Some mighty Mischief now impending shows, And seems to threaten with unusual Woes: What Apprehensions hence my Peace destroy, And even in thy Presence, blast my Joy? How will they then, while thou'rt hence surprize, What countless Store of Jealousies will 'rise? Oh! what Mistrust? What Terrors will impart A constant Anguish to my aching Heart? Be ever careful, and afford me Rest, For both our sakes, Adonis! this Request: Let not thy Mind be tempted to refuse, Nor slight a Goddess, when she humbly sues. Yet oh! most happy and secure to live, To Love and Me, all, all thy Moments give. I not with Juno, covet boundless Reign, Nor strive with Pallas on the fatal Plain, Such Triumphs, such dire Victories to gain: Nor with Diana to the Chace inclin'd. Do's thy affected Sport delight my Mind. I all my Thoughts on Love alone employ, That yields the truest and sublimest Joy; Of all Diversions, only this is mine, And dearest Youth! let it be ever thine; Let's bid to ev'ry vainer Thing, Adieu, You only bless'd in Me, and I in You. Here by increasing soft Concern possess'd, She ceas'd to speak, and ardently she press'd His Hand, and Looks, and Kisses plead the rest. But ah! the Sallies of a roving Mind, No soft Endearments, or Entreaties bind: Still in his Thoughts the wild Infection reigns, He Freedom loves more than Cælestial Chains: Nor can th' greatest Beauty of the Skies, With all her Fondness and her Grace suffice; But as young Striplings from the watchful Eye, Break wildly forth, and to their Pastimes fly; Their Friends, and their secure Abodes neglect, And Counsel, and 'forewarning Care reject: He vent'rously again the Chace pursues, And Fearless in the Woods his Haunts renews; Too soon, alas! forsakes her safer Arms, Heedless of her Advice, and all her Charms, Spurns at the Pleasures of his blissful State, Perversly blind, and rushes on his Fate.</field>
