      <field name="fulltext">LOUISA'S POEM Wen I was yung and hadunt hares And didunt nevver say my prares No more than baby don't upstares I was a favrit child But now my nurse keeps saying Loo Wot kook and gardner fink is troo A deemuns gone and got in you And made you wikkid wild. A NEIGHBOUR The Lord Almighty chose to give This hedgehog room enough to live Upon the world where you and I Look up to praise Him in the sky. The Hedgehog clearly understands The weakness of the little hands That seem, when he considers all His work and dangers, very small. He steadily and strongly grows A bunch of thorns, to prick the nose Of any dog that dares attack The fortress on his rounded back. If threatened, he applies the rule They taught him at his Infant School: He makes a ball of back and chest, And keeps on hoping for the best. The Lord Almighty chose to give The hedgehog room enough to live Upon the world. I want to add That I, for one, am very glad. THE UNHAPPY MONTH When Uncle was ill for a month at our house With a terrible pain in his side, We learned how we loved him, for all of us sobbed, And even the errand-boy cried. We crept up to bed without shoes on our feet, As softly as mice on a floor, And Mother allowed me—she couldn't do more— To throw him a kiss through a crack in the door. And Bess did, And Jess did. My Golliwog lived in the cupboard for days With the Bear and the Geese and the Goat, For how could I think about toys when I had Such a sorrowful lump in my throat? Each evening dear Daddy came up to our room And bade us do all that we should For one who had never been other than good, So I prayed for my Uncle as hard as I could. And Bess did, And Jess did. When Doctors and Nurses decided at last There was only his strength to regain, We told all the thrushes and robins and tits That our Uncle was free from his pain. One morning we went to the side of his bed, As Mother and Father had planned. Just why it was so I can scarce understand, But I burst into tears when he gave me his hand. And Bess did, And Jess did. DILLY DUCKLING As Dilly had the splendid luck Of being born a tiny duck, It very soon occurred to him That he should try to swim. While living in an egg, you see, He failed to guess what he would be, And little knew his heart was fond Already of a pond. He wasn't much astonished when He found his mother was a hen; But after he had watched her long He felt that she was wrong. Amazed to see the duckling float, The hen shrieked “Murder! Fetch a boat!” While Dilly thought that her distress Was female fussiness, And rudely called to her, “Goodbye! You look so horrid when you cry! If you are keen to get me back, Why ever don't you quack?” AN EXPLANATION “How intensely interesting!” Said the Cuckoo. “She is nesting, And a neater little pipit never flew! I am tempted to reward her By supplying such a boarder As so capable a wife deserves to view. It may seem a kind of madness To be anxious for her gladness At the heavy cost of giving up my own; But a Cuckoo's not a narrow, Mean, and self-assertive sparrow, And her heart is more like putty than like stone. There is something so appealing In a pipit, that a feeling, As of charity neglected day by day, Would be sure to fret and blame me Morning, noon, and night, and shame me If I kept the egg I ought to give away. Other birds enjoy the blisses Of exchanging horny kisses With a family of children in a nest; They can love them, cuddle, feed them, Form their manners wisely, read them All the lessons of the brain and of the breast; But a Cuckoo, out of tender Inclination to surrender What was granted her by Love in days of old, Has become a creature blighted, Through her generous heart, and slighted, Though deserving of a statue made in gold. When I think of all the twaddle Active in a human noddle, And the rubbish I have often overheard, Need I wonder if those crazy Men with cameras call me lazy And a vicious sort of profiteering bird? Noisy, in and out of season, They extol their gift of reason, Yet to none of them the lovely truth is known That a Cuckoo gives her treasure To increase a small bird's pleasure, Since her heart is more like putty than like stone.” A HOUSEHOLDER If clouds are torn and hailstones drop Upon the tender lupin crop, With solemn earnestness I go Inside my little bungalow. I never take, when I retire, A leaf and read it near a fire, Because my dwelling-place is not The sort that has a chimney-pot. I doubt if you could ever guess How much I love my loneliness, Without a saucepan in the house, A hassock, breadknife, beetle, mouse. Perhaps a sofa and a rug May look, in other dwellings, snug, But furniture can never be Allowed in mine, because of me. If weatherbound, I do not fret, Content to know that I shall get, When thunder dies, a chance to roam, Accompanied, of course, by home. In darkness, having eaten all The food I need, I mount a wall And write with silver-coloured ink Whatever I may chance to think. If you had had the luck to dwell Inside a bungalow of shell, You would have written thus your pale, Yet captivating, Fairy-tale. UNCLE I'm sure no children ever had An Uncle half so queer as ours. He doesn't shoot, he doesn't fish, He doesn't even gather flowers. We sometimes run like mad and scream Because a wasp is on his nose; But Uncle talks to it, and seems Quite disappointed when it goes. One day, while we were strolling home Along the fieldpath near the dell, He took his cap off to a cow And asked if she and hers were well. She looked so cross that Uncle said, “Perhaps this lady isn't used To greetings from a gentleman To whom she's not been introduced.” On finding brambles with a load Of berries in a sunny place, He bared his head and spoke for us A new and lovely kind of Grace: “For all the fruit that thou can'st give To birds, to children, and to men We thank Thy Maker and our own In terms of thoughtful love. Amen.” Last night we sat upon a rug And whispered till a blackbird flew Across the lawn to find a twig Inside a damson, out of view. For twenty minutes there he sang Of faith and love at eventide; And when he finished, Uncle rose, Arranged his hair, and thus replied: “Allow me, in my humble way, To thank you, Sir, for such a treat As even you, from out a bill Of genius, hardly could repeat. The passage, just before the end, That made me rank you as the birds' Dark-feathered Shakespeare, was a theme Beyond the skill of human words. “Permit me now to introduce Albreda, Dorothy, and Meg, Who, being honest, never wish, As robber maids, to steal an egg. Through me they thank the golden bill That sang a history fair and bright Within the damson. Please accept Our sterling gratitude. Goodnight!” He said to me on Thursday, when I told him I was Twelve, “My dear, What present will you give to me For Uncling hard throughout the year? As household Tiger, I received Acidulated drops, I know; But how about my little bill As Crocodile and Buffalo?” I'm sure no children ever had An Uncle half so strange as ours. He doesn't shoot, he doesn't fish, He doesn't even gather flowers. But though he takes our breath away At times by being odd and queer And difficult to understand, He's dearer far than only dear! THE DAISY'S SERMON FOR CHILDREN Love all you can Is an excellent plan For God's little children, For woman and man. Could you agree To take lessons from me, How very much gladder Your Angels would be! Do you suppose That a daisybud grows To die from the treading Of dozens of toes? Daisybuds mean That the Master has been To fill them with treasure And wrap them in green. DIFFICULT I can't say my prayers. Mammy's singing downstairs, And I want to be standing Outside on the landing. I can't keep my thought Upon Heaven, as I ought, Loving Jesus. I want you To wait for me. Can't you? My sisters stand near, Neither seeming to hear. Do you mind being busy With Ada and Lizzie, And letting me creep From the room? Will you keep For a little offender A look sweet and tender? THE AUTUMN CLOUD “I acknowledge I am gloomy,” said the Cloud, “But I wear the only colour I'm allowed. If I meet you in your rambles On the moor in search of brambles, Though my raindrops want to kiss you I will do my best to miss you,” Said the Cloud. “But, remember, I am Duty,” said the Cloud, “And neglect of duty cannot be allowed. What I carry must be shaken From my bosom, and be taken By the multitudes that link me With their nature when they drink me,” Said the Cloud. “Next, remember, I am Beauty,” said the Cloud, “And neglect of beauty cannot be allowed. I am loveliness for cherries, Little drops of wine in berries, And a part of all the swaying When the wind and wheat are playing,” Said the Cloud. “Recollect that I am Wisdom,” said the Cloud, “And defeat of wisdom cannot be allowed. If the world were always sunny, Bees would die for want of honey, And the corn could never thank me In a whisper while it drank me.” Said the Cloud. THE PICNIC Carrying hard-boiled eggs and cake and sandwiches of tongue All along the waspy lane where Hildegarde was stung, Laughingly I listened while my nieces praised their School's Only perfect breaker of the two-and-fifty rules. Mistresses were darlings, or were demons; food was “tosh,” Nearly every branch of learning died the death as “bosh.” Hearing this, the local jays determined to retire; Creepers half way up a bole began to creep up higher; Nimbleboy, the squirrel, taking fright along with those, Corkscrewed wildly up a beech with panic-stricken toes. Possibly believing that, as dread for heart and brain, Half a dozen toothy dogs were sniffing down the lane, Sudden flashed from out the fern beside the narrow trail Master Quickfoot Rabbit, with his powder-puff of a tail. Careless of the bramble, though it scratched him like a comb, Headlong up the bank he went to find his earthy home, There to compliment his legs, and rest awhile in peace, Thankful not to suffer from a large amount of niece, Such as tore an Uncle (plainly past his middle bloom) Roughly from a magazine and sofa in his room. Ere the hungry children bit the white and gold of eggs Stinging-nettles feasted on a meal of lanky legs, Causing bright quotations from the lingo of their School's Desperate defier of the two-and-fifty rules. Acid drops with sandwiches, and goose-berries with cake, Mingled in a careless style, undoubtedly would make Anguish for an Uncle, yet my every pigtailed friend, Never stopping to inquire if this and that would blend, Scornful when I said my blood was running cold with fear, Thrust a hand in any bag that happened to be near. Nieces animated by perhaps a thousand jinks Don't permit their Uncles to indulge in Forty Winks: Thus it was I found myself, as one opposed to four, Flattened by a frenzied mass of schoolgirl on the moor. How they managed to produce mysteriously, at need, Legs enough to satisfy a wriggling centipede; How they managed to produce as many arms as legs; Why they were not tamed at all by sandwiches and eggs; How it was they left me with a patch or two of hair, None but they, the huggers and the kissers, can declare. Suddenly a postman with a bicycle and beard, Dreading instant murder (it was worse than that) appeared; Twinkled when I told him I was looking for Police, Twinkled when I asked him if he knew a cure for niece. Thereupon the children, who were sobered by the man, Turned their backs on both of us, and resolutely ran Fast toward the clump of elms where whortleberries grow, Coloured, but not shaped, to match the body of a sloe. Safe perchance for half an hour, I knelt upon the ground, Hunting for my collar-stud. The thing was never found. Noses, lips, and fingers stained, the truants brought to me Berries as refreshing as a cup of Indian tea Handed, in a garden, by a combed and muslined child, Neater than a rosebud, and as tame as she was wild. Chatterboxing homeward up the hillside in a bunch, Counting all the bruises of the battle after lunch, Soon we reached the summit, where the wood upon the crest, Brilliant with the flaming of the glory in the West, Volleyed bedtime pigeons far across the heath that lay Lovely with magenta at the drooping of the day. A GREAT COMPLIMENT Forasmuch as you have chosen to collect From the orchard and the garden what you needed, When you put your heads together to erect In the double-may a cottage, while I weeded, And pretended not to know of lovers fitting Moss to horsehair, by the genius of the bill, As exponents of the fine ancestral knitting That so delicately baffles human skill; Forasmuch as you have flattered me by counting On my garden as a honeymoony place, And have trusted me with treasure slowly mounting To the total that is proper to your race, I confess that (though my life is full of labours Such as worry him whose loaf is bought by words) I am puzzled how to thank my new-come neighbours As befits the faith of complimentary birds. I shall never, if I live to grow white-headed And a fidget when the grass is damp with dew, See a home of love more wisely built and steadied, Or a dearer pair of chaffinches than you. HIS EXAMINATION “You answered all the questions well, My brilliant son,” the Badger said; “That masterly account of Smell Did double honour to your head. Not less convincing was the style In which you spoke of forest fare. No wonder that your parents smile And feel repaid for constant care. The gaining of so many marks Is proof that now our boy is fit To seek in coppices or parks A private hole and live in it. What's that? You want to dawdle near This home above the field of corn? To-morrow, if I find you here, You'll wish you never had been born! Your mother and myself have done, Ungrudgingly by day and night, Our best to satisfy a son Conspicuous for his appetite. Be off! Let foolish men retain Their sons as long as twenty years, To cause perplexity and pain, And set the household by the ears; But Badgers, who have studied more Than men can ever hope to know, Must put a limit to their store Of love, and change from friend to foe. Augustus, let me see your tail! Begin at once your own career, And, if by any chance you fail, Don't dare to come and snivel here!” CONTENT IN FLOWER I'm Crocus. I am very glad To be what I was meant to be: A little orange-coloured lad Of old and famous family. My clever teachers sent me up To daylight from a hidden place, And ordered me to make my cup A golden credit to the race. I found that what I had to do Contentedly from hour to hour Was adding to the world a few Delights as long as I could flower. I'm Crocus. Here I work and praise, As Willow, Poplar, Oak and Pine. Though Beauty has ten thousand ways Of loveliness, she's glad of mine.

A POINT OF VIEW “With their heels on the ground And their brains in the air, These men,” said an Oak, “Are but creatures of care; And as long as they live In the world upside-down, Where they love to be odd, They will fidget and frown. When I dropped from the tree, As a youngster, I knew What was best for a wise Little acorn to do; For my mother had said When she bade me goodbye, Sink your wits in the ground, Push your feet to the sky. I'm a hundred years old, And I haven't a care, With my brains in the ground And my heels in the air.” LISTEN! Before we arrive at the wood near the stream, With a wickerwork basket to fill, For Grannie, because she is kept in the house By her legs, which are terribly ill, I want you to promise me neither to kick The enchantingly beautiful face Of a hyacinth angel, nor roughly to tread With the soles of your shoes on the arm of a fern Or the wood-sorrel's exquisite head. Be certain that hyacinths never were made To be carelessly murdered, my Dear, By greedy consumers of loveliness lent To remind us that Wisdom is near. If all of us tenderly think of the hours When the Saviour stands deep in a wood And nods to the smile of the primroses there, We never shall willingly bruise or destroy What can lessen the load of His care. THE BOY AND THE BEE How many times do you intend To cross the lawn, my busy friend? Obedience tells me that the price Of every load is crossing twice. The Clover's patient, but her breast Is ready for an hour of rest. I hear her begging me to stay And kiss her in the usual way. Why toil from morn till night? Be brave! A servant's better than a slave. Suppose a star refused to run! Half-holidays would spoil a sun. But other bees will cause to thrive Your sugary larder in the hive. Disgraceful! Would you have me shirk The ancient discipline of work? A little leisure could not harm The toilers of the honey-farm. A little leisure is the door That opens on the path to more. You vex me. Take the homeward track And leave me lying on my back. Although your Mother's raking stones Along the border? Such are drones! DOUBLE DELIGHT I have an Uncle, who can rhyme At almost any time. He's married to my youngest Aunt, Who can't. But she can play the hardest piece Of music for her niece, That seems to gallop on the page In rage. It's very nice when Uncle strokes His head, to bring the jokes, And makes the bees of magic come And hum. But Auntie gives me more delight When, popping in at night, She lets me stroke upon the bed Her head. THE WIZARD “My boots are getting tired of feet,” Said Uncle. “Let us take a seat Upon the hot and shining grass In hope of seeing lizards pass; For lizards commonly reside In places that are countrified, Where lofty woods of heather raise Their branches in a perfect maze, And where they frequently surprise A buzzing Parliament of Flies. The more I think of them, the less I seem to understand them, Bess! For instance, if a lizard's tail, Through crime or carelessness, should fail, How does he manage to produce A new edition for his use, With not a servant, not a friend, To help him bring about this end? The reason why he never smokes, Or packs his head with silly jokes, Is one that all of us can spy With but a quarter of an eye. Yet when in wonderment we stand, His termination in our hand, And feel that he will hardly care A fig to lose a thing so fair (Because he knows that he can find A way of blossoming behind), We one and all completely fail To solve the Mystery of the Tail. Your favourite soldier, Captain Preece, Returned, but left a leg in Greece. Can he, or Major-General Grant, Repair the loss by growth? He can't; And since a lizard, old or young, Has other uses for his tongue Than blabbing secrets that have lain For countless centuries in the Brain That rules as strongly as of yore Its coloured children on the moor, It follows that a lizard's plan Will never be a help to Man, Who's bound to say, with deep concern, The leg that's off will not return. So, Bess, we see that Nature means To vary in her different scenes; And even for the tribe in which We struggle onward, poor and rich, To use, however small the range, Her master instrument of Change. Likeness, wherever seen, is such As shows unlikeness, whether much Or little. Let us now compare Your own with Auntie Ada's hair— Resemblances that almost meet As likenesses, yet incomplete. Or choose to-morrow any rose— Quick, Darling! See him? There he goes, The colours flashing on his mail, Along—Why, Bess, he's lost his tail!” SHOCKING! “To tell the truth,” said Mrs. Hen, “I don't think very much of men. It's true they give me corn to eat, But truer that they lie and cheat. They run on knickerbockered legs, With ugly boots, to steal my eggs, And make me, with deceitful words, Adopt as mine another bird's. I'm cross with ducks. To think that they Should dare to copy what I lay! It's quite astonishing to see How sharp these criminals can be. When ducks and men together plot, How small a chance a hen has got! I saw my sister, hanging slack, Without a feather on her back, From Jim the Ploughboy's hand to-day. Imagine it! Is that the way To use a creature who has done Her quiet best for everyone? Now, Sally, Sensible, and Ruff, I feel that this is quite enough To tell you why,” said Mrs. Hen, “I don't think very much of men.” THE COMPLAINT It's only half a joy To be a human boy. He's taken to a den Of domineering men And told that Ethelred (How valuable!) is dead. He passes further on To learn the date of John, With various kinds of bosh Connected with the Wash; Or how the monarch pined Because of what he signed While sitting in the hay At Runnymede one day. From week to week he hates More bitterly the dates, The Treaties and the Bills Of royal Jacks and Jills Not even fit to rule A village Infant School. He often sits and writes Of equatorial sights, Explaining why his own Is not a Torrid Zone, And where the heathen glut Themselves with coco-nut, Or spend an afternoon In cooking a baboon. At other times perhaps He's driven mad by maps Of lakes and river-beds And puzzling watersheds Before he's given a sum That makes his brainpan hum, And causes him to wish To be a bird, or fish, Or even—such his load Of killing work!—a toad Untroubled by a thought Of what the merchant bought At eighteen pence, but sold For half an ounce of gold, If cannibals forgot To boil him in a pot. The young gorilla knows The number of his toes, And where to find a bunch Of appetising lunch. Imagine what he'd think If put to pen and ink And told to fix the spot Of some recurring dot! The hairy boy would swing A club like anything And break it on the head Or chest of him who said, While pointing to a bench, Prepare that page of French, Or badgered him to spell Egyptian parallel! The young gorilla's school Is green and beautiful, Without a trace of men's Destructive fountain-pens. It's one gigantic room Of stem and leaf and bloom, With dinners neatly hung On boughs for old and young. His father does not spend Bananas on a friend Who's willing to annoy His energetic boy With lessons in return For fruit he's glad to earn, But teaches him to get The forest Alphabet By heart as soon as he Can manage A.B.C. When certain that the youth Is ready for the truth Of Nature in the wild, He liberates the child And lets him roam at will The jungle on the hill To find and pick a bunch Of breakfast or of lunch. It's only half a joy To be a human boy. EARLY LAMBS “The pasture-field is gay with lambs In love,” said Governess, “with dams Who give them, when they want to feed, The drink of milk they often need. It's not at all an easy thing To be a lamb, before the Spring, With pluck enough to wag a tail Defiantly at snow and hail. Each woolly ulster is as wet As buttercups and daisies get When sulky sunbeams will not try With lips of fire to drink them dry. But later, when the clouds have shed The total of their tears on head And flinching shoulder, back, and side, The lambs are deeply gratified, And leap toward the sun, as though They want to kiss him for the glow He spreads upon the grassy school Of little scholars dressed in wool. Grown stronger, they begin to run A field or two away in fun, As he, the four-legged Scatterbrain, We met just now in Gipsy Lane. Unlike the tunnel-making mole (Too earnest to forget his hole), The heedless and mercurial lamb Will lose himself, his field, his dam. Although he butts a fleecy wedge Of forehead through the hawthorn hedge, He doesn't stop to memorise The hole's position, sort, and size. What desolation follows! What Bewildered rushing past the spot That only half an hour ago He made himself, yet doesn't know! In awkward haste, the peril past, He blunders back to love at last, And helps himself to milk, and drinks A great deal better than he thinks. No doubt Elizabeth and Jim, If wise enough to study him, Could learn a lesson. But I won't Be sharp or grumpy if they don't!” A PAIR OF FRIENDS The Toadflax trembled when I laid My length beside him on the hill At Winderton, as though afraid That I belonged to them who kill The floral princes in a bower Of beauty, wheresoe'er it be, Instead of giving to a flower Alliance, worship, sympathy. “Good morning, Toadflax!” I began, While looking where to put my feet— A highly recommended plan— For fear of bruising any sweet Associate of the flax. “I vow That when my arms and legs depart Your loveliness shall be, as now, A temple for a feeling heart. “I do not slowly murder bloom That takes my fancy in the wild, And let it dwindle in a room, As though it were a sickly child. I want to breathe it for a time, To learn a lesson, read a soul, Convey the flower to rustic rhyme, And leave it, as I found it, whole.” The Toadflax bent his gracious head, As if to bless me. There I lay And felt how truly I was fed By undestroying holiday. At last I rose, but ere I went Toward my home I thanked the flower Wholeheartedly for having lent So much to me for half an hour. TWO GIFTS Tall on a mound in Paradise, The Father scanned with earnestness The new—made wonder that his love And wealth and skill desired to dress. “The growing-time has come to pass,” Said God; and Earth was bright with Grass. Watching the flowerless leagues of green, The Daisies on the mound began To beg that some of them might go To sit in fields and wait for Man. “Your travelling-time has come to pass,” Said God; “improve my gift of Grass.” JOY Only a stable could be found At Christmastide to shelter them; Only a yard or two of ground Beneath that roof in Bethlehem; Yet Mary, on a bed of straw, Was neither cold nor comfortless, Since breathing near her heart there lay God's love as Human Littleness. Oxen were holy in her sight, And well she knew the manger shone Lovely with such mysterious light As only mothers look upon. When Joseph grieved because she fared Without her friends at Nazareth She smiled, and, listening for the sound Of baby breathing, held her breath. A FRIEND IN NEED “I think this sum will break my heart,” Said Ada to the yellow rose That tapped upon the pane, as if To bid her not to ink her nose. “The rabbit died through being fed With heaps of grass by Jane and Dick, And Governess is killing me, By inches with Arithmetic. “I can't imagine why she cares A single farthing when she's told How many stupid ounces make In copybooks a ton of gold. As if it matters, when I hear The yelping of the terrier pups, Or when the fields beside the stream Are busy with their buttercups!” On saying this, she bumped her head Upon the table in despair, And littered the untidy page With webs of barley-coloured hair. Her shoulders quivered, and her toes Were furious in her little shoes Because of all the lovely fun That multiplying made them lose. “Ada, my Darling,” said a voice, “Two heads are better far than one When problems of Arithmetic Or French or Parsing must be done.” The worried scholar raised her head, And almost shouted in surprise At being kissed upon her mouth, Her cheeks, her dimple, and her eyes. Between the inkwell and the book, Her wings composed of living lace, Her frock as blue as heaven, there stood A Fairy with a helping face! She showed a tiny silver pen, And laughed, and said that she had come, On hearing human sobs, to work The pounds and ounces of the sum. She squared her elbows, and began To drive the pen with all her might. Three minutes later she had drawn A line beneath the answer. Right! On Ada's dimple, lips, and eyes Her kisses fell as fast as rain; And then she vanished. She had gone To soothe another puzzled brain. RUPERT RABBIT Now, Geraldine and Lance and Nell, If you have time, and want to hear Of Rupert Rabbit, I can tell The startling points of his career. Rupert was foolishly inclined To think that tender brains suffice. He rarely listened to his kind Old father's excellent advice. He used to edge away, as though The lecture kept him from a walk, And whisper to his cousin, “Joe, What balderdash these parents talk!” One evening, when he plainly showed, By flapping ears and vacant look, Less rabbit-reverence than he owed, The father called his son to book: “Before you hurry off to bite Those carrots near the onion-bed I wish to know if you are quite Aware of all that I have said. Imagine how my heart is wrung, And what your loving mother feels, When any of our heedless young Are carried pieward by the heels! Once more I tell you clearly what Neglecting our example means: A flash! a bang! a deadly shot! Enamel saucepans! soup tureens!” “My dear old Dad,” his son replied, “We youngsters have a better plan (Extremely safe and simplified) Than yours of circumventing Man. I freely own that you are most Attentive and affectionate; But, Daddy, you have missed the post! You're cobwebbed, moss-grown, out-of-date! Be positive that if you wave The younger School of Rabbits by There's nothing known on earth to save Your joints from hotting in a pie!” “How many a lad,” his father said, “Who ought to be a model son, Mistakes his unimportant head For that of clever Solomon! Your mother, if she likes, may still Exhort and plead and argufy, But, Boaster, I have said my fill. We shall not have you long. Goodbye!” His father flourishes, my Dears, But Rupert's hanging (run and look!) With blinded eyes and deafened ears In Grannie's larder from a hook! WHAT AUNTIE SAID Your Father is extremely fond Of going to his private pond And pulling out such fairy-fish As never lie upon a dish In solemn rows, with parsley spread Beside a tail, beside a head. All trespassers would seek in vain To fish the pond of Father's brain, Since none could climb the fence of bone That keeps the pond his very own, And use, as he, the proper weight And sort of appetising bait. He carries over Frolic Hill The rod of work, the line of skill, The hook of thought. With clever care He lays upon the bank a pair Of what so many children wish— Those silver-sided fairy-fish With fins as perfect as their scales, And brightness even in their tails. Thus, frequently, he goes beyond The Hill of Frolic to the pond Where no one else, however fine, However big, can cast a line. Then, happy in his faded coat, He watches hour by hour the float, Prepared to sit with Trust and wait For bobbing fish to nose the bait. You children always think he ought To show the fish as soon as caught, But, being tired, he often goes To have a game of dominoes With Mother in the little room Where Rest and Love and Quiet bloom When Evening, gentler than a mouse, Becomes the mistress of the house. Be patient! In a month or two Your Father means to print for you A hundred pages, all in rhyme, About his luck at fishing-time. Then clap your hands! Then rush to look At what his basket (that's a book) Contains for you to eat with eyes Astonished to a larger size! COLUMBUS Columbus, long and long ago You bravely left behind The Star of Home, and went to seek As much as you could find. I wonder, Captain, if you waved To children on the quay A hand that many flooded eyes Were far too wet to see. I wonder if your own were wet, And if a gust of pain Was almost strong enough to drive The ship to port again. As though you heard a Spirit count The islands of the West, You steered away from Love, and dared The grieving of your breast. But often in that fretted realm Of running hills and vales, When Hope was dying in the ship, And Fury burst the sails; When Land, which once had been a faith, Was scarce a happy dream, You must have longed for paper boats And children by a stream. While Memory in her cabin sought To turn your heart from Care, The gold you most desired to touch Was little children's hair. Columbus, long and long ago You steered from home; to find Americas too poor to pay For wealth you left behind. THE NEW WORD (Nurse) Well, I declare! I never saw such hair! Your nose is inked, Your dress is crumpled, And both your cheeks Look red and rumpled. Not very long ago I made you nice and clean. Where—in—the—world, Miss Ada, have you been? (Ada) I don't much care About my hair, So there! Or even if my nose Is black as crows. And isn't this the dress You said last night Was very little more Than just a fright— Too short, too tight? (Nurse) Perhaps. But, come, I want to know How such a wild, Disastrous child, With all those knots Of tangled hair, With one arm scratched And both knees bare, Contrived to look As though a witch Had flung her over Hedge and ditch. (Ada) I've had the loveliest game You ever heard! And Uncle's been and Gone and made For me a special word! It isn't in a book, However close you look; A baby time ago It wasn't born, you know. Because you're never rough And slappy, Nurse, I mean To let you be the third To hear my special word. I've been affectioneering— (Nurse) You've—been—what? (Ada) I've been AFFECTIONEERING With Uncle in his lair. I kissed him when a bison, I kissed him when a bear, I rolled him on the hearthrug, I nipped him with the tongs, I made him promise me to write A lot of fairy-songs— The sort that tinkle-tinkle-tink So nicely in his Think Before they stand in lovely lines Of letters made with ink. (Nurse) Small wonder, Dear, You look so red and queer! I realise that games With Uncle James— Who seems a gentleman As full of fun and tricks As though at fifty-four, His heart was only six— Begin with tongs And end with fairy-songs, But Joy must share the time With soap as well as rhyme, And little children's faces Be cleaner than disgraces. So, march upstairs with me And try your best to be, By using sponge and brush and comb, A credit to a Christian home. THE SNOWDROP AND THE CHILD I cannot stay Beyond my day. There's a Master underground Who keeps calling me away. He lets me show This cup of snow, To remind the human breast Of divinity below. While here I learn Your love, I earn Both the bliss of holiday And the beauty of return. If fingers break My stalk, they take Only something that my Lord Is determined to re-make. Both how and why He lends me sky For so short a part of Spring, Ere I seem to you to die, Is secrecy For you, for me. He is wisdom without end, And He knows what ought to be. Believing this, I take the kiss Of my sweethearts, sun and wind, For a month of earthly bliss. But when my gown Is turning brown, I, who lately travelled up, Must begin to travel down. Be ready, Dear, For love next year. There's a Master underground, And He means to send me here. KNOWLEDGE While I moved across the down, Holding Mother's lilac gown, I was wondering what she meant When she told me I was sent To be her consolation. Then, I lived upon the bliss Of her handclasp and her kiss, Unaware that I bestowed Any lessening of the load That often made her weary. Now, upon the ancient down, Little fingers hold my gown, Teaching what my Mother meant When she told me I was sent To be her consolation. THE THREE ANGELS “While the children sit and think,” Said the Angel of the Pink, “Working hard at baby sums With their fingers and their thumbs, Flowers can watch a butterfly Draw upon the summer sky Such a pattern as would take Even me an hour to make.” “While the children tap their toes,” Said the Angel of the Rose, “Crossly underneath the bench Where they almost die of French, Warbling tutors sweetly tell Naked scholars why a shell (Good for keeping out the dew) Cracks conveniently in two.” “While the children, after dusk,” Said the Angel of the Musk, “Worry Uncles to invent Giants for their merriment, Far away in heavenly plots Pansies and forget-me-nots Kiss the feet of Him whose birth Gave the fairest flower to Earth.” RATHER STRANGE I often wish I could have been A Squirrel in a home of green, And kept a Bank of nuts, and run Along a bough to teach my son The art of using as a sail, And balancing, his new-born tail. I shouldn't like, upon the whole, To be a subterranean Mole And work extremely hard to found A little London underground, With Blackham Place, and Lightless Square, And Tubes containing stuffy air. But frequently I want to be An equatorial Chimpanzee At home among the forest fruit, Attired in such a shaggy suit As Esau, who was fond of hair, Was never privileged to wear. Of course I never wish to make A change to Thirty Feet of Snake, And hang with loops of death in trees, In wicked readiness to squeeze Their life and love and simple hopes From unsuspecting Antelopes! It's rather strange that when a Niece And Nephew come to break my peace I never fret to wear the shape Of Squirrel, Albatross, or Ape, But merely want to have my joy As half a Girl and half a Boy. LEAVING HOME He wandered away from his telescope, Sat heavily down, and began to mope. “Mechanical fliers will reach me soon, I gravely fear,” said the Man in the Moon. “Deserting their shops and their pavingstones, The trams and the trains and the telephones, The bomb, the cannon, the ship and the wreck, They are looping the Loop of the Broken Neck. I used to whistle, as merry as June, And live as I liked,” said the Man in the Moon. “I used to bubble and chuckle with mirth Because of the fussing and clatter on Earth, And laugh aloud at the fierce and the bold, Unable to dig for my magical gold, Or tear the web of the hammock I fetch At times from a silvery box, and stretch To make a swing, or a beautiful bed When melody sounds in my dreaming head. I fainted once, when a beast of a cow Jumped over my Moon (I shall never guess how), But what if an aeroplane, carrying ten Be-goggled and greasy mechanical men, Alights in the cabbages, knocks them flat, And turns to water the heart of the cat? It's time for the packing of bags. I'll go And chum with a comet I used to know. I'll gather my goods and be off by noon, And puzzle them all,” said the Man in the Moon. THE WARWICKSHIRE AVON Many mighty rivers run,— Mississippi, Amazon,— Faster than he travels here Through his darling Warwickshire. Many rivers roar their way Downward to a giant bay, Unaware that he, the small, Gentle-voiced, is best of all. Only eager babes as yet, Tiny tributaries fret Past the home of upland wheat, Marigold and meadowsweet, Till as bosom-friends they glide Through the pasture side by side, Very proud of moving down Solemnly to Stratford Town. Loved for many a quiet pool, Thames and Tweed are beautiful; Loved for many a poet's song, Living yet, they flow along Fair and proud; but Avon lipped Fingers that were idly dipped Long ago when Shakespeare sat Close beside him. Think of that! HIS GRATITUDE The Fern (Who knows his name in French?) Was just beginning to unclench His little furry fist, To play with drops of dew and learn How quietly the dewdrops turn From water into mist. At first he grew as if he thought The world was something to be fought; But now he plainly sees That what with diligence he grows Is neither luncheon for the crows Nor breakfast for the bees. He found that he could safely hang Above the dimpling Brook, that sang Regardless of applause, And kissed the heifer's feet, and showed A moorhen on the running road That ran without a pause. November came. Within the Brook His likeness wore a browner look Than he had seen of old. He understood that Loveliness Was slowly giving for a dress Of green a dress of gold. Before he vanished underground He thanked the World where he had found Content in sun and mist, And told the Brook that in the Spring He meant to come again and bring His little furry fist. HER WEARY FATHER If I had time to play with you In your imaginary Zoo, My bonny Treasure, I'd imitate a flopping seal, Or utter a baboony squeal, At once with pleasure. But I was caught from nine till six In London's trap of fog and bricks And furious fusses. I bounded swiftly, like an ape, From street to gutter, to escape The omnibuses. I'm far more tired than I can tell Of all the complicated smell, Pianos, taverns, The crowd of frocked and trousered moles That fill, as ants their smaller holes, Electric caverns. St Paul may have a splendid dome, Yet what is that compared with home And Mother's laughter, And pansies in a bowl, and you (Forgetful of a kangaroo), And bedtime after? Excuse me if I cannot feel A wish to represent a seal With movements floppy. I love the creature's clever mind, But, in its way of walking, find It hard to copy. To-morrow I will try to be A buffalo or chimpanzee, Or such a leopard As, forced by several appetites, Is just as happy if he bites A sheep or shepherd. But now I want to hear you read Those verses telling how a weed Besought a Fairy To change her to a hedgeside rose, That Love might stand upon his toes To kiss her, Mary. AN APPEAL My name is Snowdrop. If you think That I would rather be a Pink, Believe me, I shall not be long In pointing out that you are wrong. My duty is to be content With what the brain of Wisdom meant When little Snowdrops first began Their simple partnership with Man. At School, beneath a roof of mould, I learned the Alphabet of Cold, And gained the confidence to show My slender self to Frost and Snow. 'Tis plain that all who love me best Will treat me as a darling guest, And let me watch the Crocus, damp With many dewdrops, trim his lamp. But those whose pleasure is to tug A flower in two and fill a mug With fainting beauty, quick to see A floral lamb, may capture me, And in a glass or china grave (Detestable to blossom!) save The flower that never wants to roam An inch beyond her tiny home. Mercy, who's sweet as Mignonette, Dear Children, begs of you to let Me spend the night with stars, and not Inside a tumbler, mug, or pot. On waking up to-morrow, dress In coloured leaves your loveliness, Protect your toes with shoes, and run To watch me bathing in the sun. Remember, I am glad to show, As Love arranged, my drop of snow, And never, never, NEVER think With stupid envy of a Pink. THE EVANGELIST Away with pen! Away with ink! Come quickly (though I think The pillow of the bed Is eager for your head) Along the passage, through the door, My Pansy in a pinafore! Uplift, console, and bless A weary verseman with your loveliness, Who's tired by staring hard at words In songs of rivulets and birds, And tired by bending over nouns So long with puzzled frowns Because his brain desired to give To each a haunting adjective! Since tea he might have had, Instead of prison and a blotting-pad, The concentrated garden that is styled (There's heaven in the name) a Child; And yet the fever in a tune Robbed him of hours of June. But now, ere Sleep has webbed and caught Her truant, let his anxious thought Refuse to flow along the line Of old-man's-beard and eglantine; And let him, thinking how he kissed Last night the same Evangelist, Prepare to welcome at the door A playmate in a pinafore, And run about his brain to find Another story of the glowing kind That fills with buds of thought The many secret gardens of her mind. THREE INVITATIONS “I am waiting, Little Children,” said the Breeze, “I am waiting for the tangles of your hair. I will show you how I play with the merry jets of spray, And will teach you half the boldness that I dare. In the winter you may dally Near a village of a valley Where the robins puff their scarlet in the trees; But in summer bring you voices Where the Sea-side wind rejoices When he drives the breakers in to hug your knees.” “Come and frolic, Little Children!” cried the Sand, “Come and frolic on the playground I have spread With the colour that is worn by the Crocus, when he's born With a lamp of beauty blazing on his head. While the porter down the narrow Gangway guides the loaded barrow, And your Father puts a shilling in his hand, Take your seats for fun and freckles, Sidmouth, Aberdovey, Beccles, Or some other golden-coasted edge of land!” “I am waiting, Little Children,” cried the Sea, “For my Williams, Robins, Dorothys, and Megs; For the castle and the moat, for the two-foot cargo-boat, And the friendliness of fat and busy legs. When you bring your welcome faces From the far-off inland places, With a dozen times a dozen sorts of glee, I shall thunder on the shoulders Of the tough and giant boulders, And shall roar my satisfaction to the quay!” BEDTIME Joy is drooping, day is done, Rest must follow after. Mount the staircase one by one, Wearied out by laughter. Bees have left the lily-bloom, Butterflies the roses; Thankful for his leafy room, Rob-in-Scarlet dozes. Dream is busy in the land! Little shutters, falling Over eyes that understand Weariness is calling, Clearly tell how Sleep, to gain What by day she misses, Glides toward the counterpane, Steals a thousand kisses. A POEM FOR PRUE Bound, Hare, bound! Here's a bully with a hound. If you'd really rather not Smell delicious in a pot, Over briar and streamlet vault, Far from pepper, far from salt, Till at last your toothy foe Cannot see which way you go. Bound, Hare, bound! Here's a bully— Yes, a bully with a yard or two of hound. Look, Salmon, look! Here's a bully with a hook. If it's really not your wish Soon to decorate a dish, Don't, by playing tug-of-war, Help this man to carry more Silvered beauty home, and bite Far too much of it at night. Look, Salmon, look! Here's a bully— Yes, a bully with a minnow on his hook. Back, Fox, back! Here are bullies in a pack. If you really want to be Safe at home in time for tea, Bid your pads and brain and breath Hold you half a mile from Death Hunting you since middle-day All along your twisty way. Back, Fox, back! Here are bullies— Here are bullies with a horsey-doggy pack. Run, Rabbit, run! Here's a bully with a gun. If you really dread to lie Close to onions in a pie, Quit that turnip, and begin Legging homeward with the skin Just as dear, of course, to you, Powderpuff, as hers to Prue. Run, Rabbit, run! Here's a bully— Yes, a bully with a cartridge in his gun. SUN AND DAUGHTER “What's in front of me to-day Is the browning of your hay, Daugther leagues and leagues away. Not a single wisp of cloud Can at present be allowed. Smile, and make your Father proud,” Said the Sun. “When I use my summer heat For the browning of your wheat, Daughter troublesome but sweet, Dress in meadow-green, and dare, Laughing merrily, to wear All the freckles I can spare,” Said the Sun. “Later, when your work is slack, Nod a welcome to the stack, Drop the fork, unbend the back. But my duty is to go Through the spinneys, there to throw Fire on crab and nut and sloe,” Said the Sun. “What remains for me when cramp Frets the farmer, cold and damp, Digging near the turnip-camp, Is to shake a golden fist Angrily at Frost and Mist Till your mouth again is kissed,” Said the Sun. “But the Crocus may be sure I shall help him to endure, Energetic, brave, and pure; And the Snowdrop shall not fail, Though the bullets of the hail Whiz around her in the gale,” Said the Sun. HILDA Hilda remembers very well Her feelings on that April morn When, scrambling from a ruined shell, Regulus Quack, her son, was born. Hilda, the hen, was petrified (Within a little) when she saw So much that seemed to stagger Pride, As well as Justice, Hope, and Law. Maternal hens, who love to hoard Their eggs for several weary weeks, Consider it a poor reward If bills arrive instead of beaks. She found it difficult to bless A child without the standard nose, And one—to add to her distress— Deprived of regulation toes. But when she met the duckling's eyes, And saw him give a tiny start Of apprehension, or surprise, She solved the mystery in her heart. At times a hen is just as quick Of understanding as a cat; And Hilda said, “A proper chick Would never look at me like that. “I noticed how, on hearing cluck The child was taken quite aback; For being by descent a duck He manifestly wanted quack.” Then Hilda, thinking it unkind To scold, or make a silly fuss, Began to do her best to find A bit of love for Regulus. THREE OF THEM You ought to see my Cousin Making poems on the Moor! Last week he wrote a dozen, To-day he's written four. There's one about the actions Of boys and girls who cry Because of Vulgar Fractions They fail to simplify; And one about a Fairy, Who turned the milk to gold In any farmer's dairy, If he were poor and old; And one about the danger Of Him who looked and smiled At oxen in the Manger— The Christmas Morning Child. NODDING AND KISSING May is ready now to give All her varied wealth to June: Baby rabbit, infant rushes, Marigolds, and pupil thrushes, Cloud, and stars, and milkwhite moon. Never think that May is sad Thus at last to end her reign. She, instead of tearful grieving, Nods farewell to us, believing Time will nod to her again. June must now agree to give All her wealth to young July: Gloves for foxes, fledgling swallow, Candid hilltop, secret hollow, Nightjar, broom, and butterfly. Never think that June is sad Thus to end her lovely reign. She, instead of tearful grieving, Throws the world a kiss, believing Time will kiss her home again. OUT OF PAIN While Mary lay alone in bed One windy afternoon Toward the end of what had been For her a dreary June, The tulips that were woven thick Upon the counterpane Stood up and blossomed in her sight, Then turned to cloth again! A human child had never seen As many as a score Of tulips that were needlework Behaving thus before. “How very comforting of you To play with me,” she said, “Exactly when a giant pain Is noisy in my head!” Immediately a blossom rose, The leader of the rest, With sunbeams in his cup, and stood Alive on Mary's breast; And each enchanted tulip then (No longer merely thread, But rooted in the counterpane) Made magic on the bed. “All flowers,” the Leader cried, “should love Companion flowers, and be, When tender-hearted Fairies let Them show their sympathy, Such consolation as a Nurse Or Doctor cannot find In book or bottle, word or kiss, In hand, in heart, in mind. “The Tulips of the coverlet Have never known a bloom So lovely as the little Maid And Mistress of the room In which a Fairy bids us try To overcome the pain By leaping out of needlework To flowers, and back again.” “Dear Tulips,” said the happy Child, “Accept my love and thanks For blossoming upon the bed In green and scarlet ranks; And quickly tell your Fairy Friend, Affectionate and wise, That all the pain is gone and Sleep Is busy in my eyes.” THEY ARE SEVEN Giant Disgust, With his hatred of glee, Is as busily bad As a giant can be. Giant Disgrace Has a pout of the size Of a cabbage, and sparks Of revenge in his eyes. Giant Delight Has the glow on his face Of a Michaelmas pear In a very warm place. Giant Obey Is a little severe, But he keeps all the sky Of a family clear. Giant Agree Is as merry as mice That have nibbled a hole In a packet of rice. Giantess Joy Is as ready to kiss As a kitten to purr In a moment of bliss. Giantess Love Is a maker of beds, And a teller of tales, And a stroker of heads. THE THANKFUL BIRDS The Blackbird in the lilac said, “Since joy has lived with me to-day, I mean to warble Hip hurray! Before I put myself to bed.” The Thrush upon the damson cried, “Since she who laid those lovely eggs Can hear in them the sound of legs, My beak is full of faith and pride.” The Chaffinch in the elder said, “A bird that hops along his life Without a plump and willing wife Is wrong in heart and wrong in head.” The Blackcap whispered to his hen, “I'm thankful every moment, Dear, That you and I and Love are here, Without a boy or cat. Amen.” TO ROSALIND There were three little bedrooms down below The stack of the chimney tall and square, And up on the roof, in a foot of snow, Was a Traveller big as a grizzly bear. He made himself small in a magic way, And, as soon as he trod on the creaking floor, He muttered a charm, he waved an arm, And at once was as big as he was before! There were five little children deep in dream, With a long black hungry stocking for each, All carefully placed, so as not to seem Too high for the loving Old Man to reach. The Visitor said, “It is fun to find Such a carpety nestful of girls and boys.” He muttered a charm, he waved an arm, And the air was alive with a covey of toys! As he moved so softly beside the beds, His holiday heart went pitter-pit-pat Till Christopher's, Margery's, Violet's, Ted's, And Annabel's stocking was fatter than fat! He made himself small in a magic way, And, as soon as he stood on the roof once more, He muttered a charm, he waved an arm, And at once was as big as he was before! His affectionate heart, for a moment sad At the pain of leaving the bonny Five, Remembered the beautiful love he had For millions of dear little souls alive. Quite suddenly into his head there popped A thought that was nothing whatever but You! He muttered a charm, he waved an arm, And went like a streak down your nursery flue! DICK AND THE DUCK Dilly, Dilly, what wonderful luck To come out of a shell as a Warwickshire duck! Roll along, and display the legs And the down of the colour of scrambled eggs! Sweet the treble you faithfully sing On your way to the pond with its reedy ring; Sweet the sorrow you pipe in a rut Of the road to the left of the forester's hut. Grass is pleasant, but water is best, For it kisses the curve of your baby-like breast. Dilly, Dilly, it wasn't my luck To be born as a tiny unsinkable duck! Bother paper and fingers and thumbs That I use when the Giant Arithmetic comes! Bother desk and the ruler and ink And the weariful hours when I'm bothered to think! Bother spectacles pinching the nose Of the mistress who taps on the floor with her toes! Dilly darling, you never can tell How I wish I had lived for a time in a shell, Waiting cosily there to be fond Of a cruise and a dive in the glittering pond. Dilly, Dilly, what wonderful luck To come out of an egg as a Warwickshire duck! THE WRONG NAME Of all the little girls I know, None loves the flowers so much as Dora. If both her parents had been told What she would do when six years old, No doubt they would have named her Flora. She always likes to take to bed A sprig of lavender or tansy, Or any other flowering friend The seasons in their kindness send: A pink, a primula, a pansy. But when on frosty days her heart For blossoms of the Spring is aching, She never, never seems to tire Of watching in the ruddy fire The tulips that the flames are making. When snowdrops come at last and say That golden friends are close behind them, The child keeps running out in rain, Then running back, then out again Along the gravel path to find them. Of all the little girls I know, None loves the flowers so much as Dora. If both her parents could have guessed The love she had within her breast, They would have named their darling Flora. THE PASSIVE RESISTER I've told you twice already that I haven't time to be, Among the hazels in the wood, a chattering chimpanzee; And yet you come and knock and cough and sigh at half-past four, And push a begging-letter underneath the study door. When Uncles grow a little bald, as well as stiff and tame, Babooning wildly in a wood is not the sort of game They choose for recreation when they hurry from the den In which they earn their bread and cheese by scratching with a pen. You children always seem to think that if the day is fine Your Uncle instantly desires to be a porcupine; Or else, amid the rushes of the brook you call the Nile, To imitate as best he can six yards of crocodile. It's true I've been a rattlesnake; it's true I've been a bear; It's true I've been a tiger in a very awkward lair, With coat and trousers coloured brown, although a little pale, And several feet of rope behind, to represent a tail; But, Letty, there are afternoons when, feeling old and slow, I wouldn't act for half-a-crown the breathless buffalo, With paper horns upon my head, while furious Cherokees Surround me in a forest glade and pepper me with peas. I'm working, breading, cheesing hard. I haven't time to play, So kiss me through the keyhole, Love, before you run away To recommend the Bouncing Wolf and dewy Prairie Plant To listen in the wigwam to their story-telling Aunt. THE BITTER WEED Children! Here's a world with roses in it, Love-lies-bleeding, larkspur, linnet, Streams to gurgle at a bend, Buttercups with gold to spend, Moss as velvety as bees, Squirrels in a town of trees, Lavender that laughs at death, Mortal, with immortal breath; Yet I see, in sharp surprise, Pouting lips and narrowing eyes! Children! Here's a world with Father in it, Mother, wondering every minute How to guard you, how to bless, How to use unselfishness; Cousin Edie, Auntie Nell, Uncle, who is quick to tell What his private fairy, Dew, Bids him rhyme and print for you; Yet I see, in sharp surprise, Pouting lips and narrowing eyes! Quarrel? Which of you will try to mend it Bravely with a kiss, and end it, Turning back to Love, who crept Out of hearing while she wept? Quarrel is a bitter weed Sprouting, from a tiny seed, Faster than the plant of Joy Grows to bless a girl and boy. Molly, Gordon, Nancy, Ned, All together! Kiss it dead! FATHER'S POEM Our Christopher has just begun His second journey round the sun. If I may judge from what I heard To-night, he nearly knows a word. At many adjectives and nouns And strange diminutives he frowns, And often seems to search his brain For language of another strain, As if in hope to recollect Expressions that are more correct: The kind that baby angels speak Instead of Double Dutch or Greek. It's wonderful how hard he tries To learn the pair of dazzling eyes That mother him; the lips that make Poppy and rosebud for his sake. It's wonderful how chuckling goes Along his body to his toes. If children of the ivy-tree Can hold, as Christopher to me When, with his fingers round my thumb, He listens to the tune I hum, The infant tendrils need not fear The bravest wind of all the year. To bend above him in his bed Is melody for heart and head; To see him lifted from his cot To brighten day is grief forgot. 'Twill take the Lord a long, long while To teach the boy a lovelier smile Than that he gives when once again Above his tiny counterpane He sees the pair of lips that make Rosebud and poppy for his sake. TWELVE This is the time when January goes Across the moor, with chilblains on his toes. Next comes the time when February drops Ten thousand tons of water on the crops. There follow hours when March, the Year's bad boy, Uproots an elm, with shrieks of windy joy. April arrives, to give near baby rills A dancing-lesson to her daffodils. May, with a heartfelt cry, is here to bless The brook with little island-homes of cress. But who is this? Revealing June appears, To tell us she's the dearest dear of dears. July's a romp! She eggs you on to play At choking Uncle in a cock of hay. Hurrah for August! She has found the knack Of turning hedgeside berries sweet and black. September follows. Ask the squirrels why They think her more a lady than July. October, have you still a fierce desire To make the beech-tree's foliage look like fire? So, misty-eyed November, yet once more You damp the paint upon the nursery door! One fact, December, is extremely plain: No goose desired to have you here again! MENTAL ARITHMETIC If twice times twenty pigeons sat Upon a tree, till thirty flew Together out of view, Yet four-and-fifty of the same Companions of the forest came (Though seven quickly sought a field, To see what it would yield, And seven carried legs and bills Away toward the distant hills) And, having half an hour to spare, Took seats upon the branches there Till several very sunburnt men Drew near the towering elm, and then With pellets slaughtered five times ten, Let little blue-eyed Peter tell, Or, if he can't, let Christabel, How many pigeons in dismay With slapping noises rushed away And lived to coo another day. SQUIRREL AND COW A Squirrel, sitting on a bough, Was greatly puzzled by a Cow. “I'd give a nut to learn,” he said, “If, when it's time to go to bed, You knock those branches off your head. “I cannot find a single trace Of knowledge in your foolish face. It would be hard for such a Fright, With one half red, the other white, To feel that what she does is right. “Instead of looking like a clown, You ought to dress yourself in brown, And then, by taking exercise, As Squirrels, Pigeons, Butterflies, And Honey-Bees, reduce your size. “How can you dully contemplate The creatures that the Woodfolk hate? How can you let that girl (whose teeth I rather like) from Deadman's Heath So tug and squeeze you underneath? “Too big to frolic on a bough, You live and die a nutless cow!— A parent satisfied to fail Her calf, and feed a milking-pail, And whisk a limp and ropey tail.” “You brown barbarian of the beech,” ('Twas thus the Cow began her speech) “A head possessing so immense A stock-in-trade of impudence Has little room for commonsense. “By being scolded and abused I'm far less angry than amused. Though vulgar chatterboxing serves To help you criticise my curves, It fails to get upon my nerves. “Within this easy-going brain I look for what will best explain The folly of your narrow view, And find it in the fact that you Have never had a cud to chew. “Remain as proud as Punch to be The russet tenant of a tree, And I, content with horns and tail, Will gladly browse along the vale And fill at morn and eve a pail. “I know a dozen friends who say That if the upper parts were grey, The under-regions and the jaws As crimson as a bunch of haws, A Squirrel might deserve applause. “But Wisdom gives the perfect suit To every animal and fruit. For all of us, however dressed, However tailed, however tressed, The plan adopted is the best.” WHEN When blackbirds sit in damson trees And pour upon the summer breeze Their bright domestic melodies, It's no use calling Uncle. When several saucy bluetits come And make the archway near the plum A quivering gymnasium, It's no use calling Uncle. When Autumn butterflies display Their wings on lavender, and stay, As if to think of God, and pray, It's no use calling Uncle. When Evening travels out of sight And Beauty comes to dress the Night In black, with silver beads of light, It's no use calling Uncle. A DISGRACEFUL AFFAIR A goblin with his arrow shot A dove upon a chimney-pot. He uttered a peculiar yell On seeing where his victim fell, And ran in haste to look for her Beneath the bush of lavender. He capered on the lawn, and threw His cap toward the sky, and flew To show a heartless mate the size And feathers of his coloured prize. This comrade had, by skill or luck, Despatched an unobservant duck, And took no interest in what The other murderer had shot. Delighted Anger quickly rose To redden forehead, cheek, and nose. The goblins flung aside the prey, And, scowling in a savage way, While using more unseemly words Than any known to Caspian Kurds, They panted round the lawn, and hit, And scratched and swore and foamed and bit! As if by magic, Snub and Bean, Two dogs, appeared upon the scene And would have added to the fight, At intervals, a clever bite, Had not their rapid glances found The pair of victims on the ground. So Snub, astonished by his luck, Instanter bolted with the duck, While Bean, too business-like to miss A chance so excellent as this, Eloped rejoicingly with what Had tumbled from the chimney-pot. Perhaps an abler man than I Could point the moral. Let him try! THE DEFENDER As soon as Mary stooped to break The violet's neck, a Fairy ran Between her fingers and the bloom, And sweetly begged her not to make So quick and heartless a mistake. The violet trembled in the shade, But did not speak a single word, Because she knew her valiant friend (A Fairy never is afraid) Would reason with the little maid. If dropped on marble or on stone, A shilling has a pretty voice; But when a Fairy begs a child To leave a violet alone, She uses an enchanting tone. The words of what the Fairy said I cannot tell you; yet I know She never wavered, never paused, Till many startled tears were shed And Mary's brow and cheeks were red. THE CANDID CUCKOO A Cuckoo and a Nightingale Once met by chance in Cowslip Vale, And after nodding each to each Sat down together on a beech, Both very willing to declare They had an afternoon to spare. “Please,” said the Nightingale, “explain The shortness of your mellow strain, Which, as it seems (he shook his head) Is over sooner than it's said— Though that's a phrase you might have heard More fitly from an Irish bird. But what I want to ask is, Why A longer strain refuse to try? Imagination can't be dead In such a very well-shaped head; And if you will, I'm sure you can Improve upon this tiresome plan. I hear with something like dismay What Poets call your roundelay, Though this and other sillier words Are laughing-stocks for clever birds. But tell me, Cuckoo, why you say So little on your woodland way, Instead of making us a speech Worth hearing from an oak or beech. Does pride, or carelessness, allow? Or are you hampered by a vow To give the world so short a cry From tousled March to gay July? I often think you have forgot The solo verses—have you not?— And kept as treasure in your heart Only the vexing chorus part. If I should be as curt as you, Whatever would the lovers do? Or those who run a special train, That city-folk shall hear my strain Where rose and honeysuckle rest In scent and starshine, breast to breast?” Just here the Cuckoo raised his voice To make the hills and woods rejoice. (If they rejoice, as Poets tell, They hide their feelings very well.) “Before,” he added, “I permit Your beak to illustrate your wit, I ought to tell you I aspire To put my knowledge out on hire. A minute grant me, to enlarge On aim and method; as to charge, I price all trills and minor thirds To suit the pockets of the birds. My wish it is to make the song Of every singer wide and strong, That birds may not with justice be Accused of such monotony As, for example, lives in you, And in the careless Pigeon too. If you will come three times a day For half an hour, I think you'll say The time has been most wisely spent In gaining vocal ornament. My references are very good From Crinkle Hill and Birdsey Wood: Please ask the Owl to let you hear The shake he learned from me last year. Let Merit reap! Let Genius thrive! Support the Ablest Bird alive! That, when you've passed the time of eggs, Grown bald, and tottery on your legs, The knowledge that you did not fail An Academic Nightingale, Who wished to put, for cheerless day, A nest-egg carefully away Where weeds and grasses, rank by rank, Conceal his private Savings'-Bank, May serve you better than a cup Of Grannie Cuckoo's Pick-me-up. I know the Thrush at Lilac Tower Charges a penny for an hour, Though how he finds this rate of pay Keeps off the Workhouse, who can say? 'Tis foolish of this bird to try To undersell me on the sly, And give to pupils small or large His lessons nearly free of charge; My terms—the Thrush is bound to smash!— Are seven a shilling, ready cash.” The Cuckoo raised his weary head, Stared at the Nightingale, and said, “Had I but known you wished to preach, Not this or any other beech Had found you sitting next to me This afternoon at half-past three. But since the question of my voice— Well known to make the hills rejoice— (I must admit that if they did, Their feelings were completely hid) Has risen in this casual way, I've listened while you said your say, In hope to have, when you had rung The changes on the English tongue, A chance to put my point of view Politely, but with force, to you. Don't fidget, please! for while you spoke I kept as steady as an oak, And only once, when most oppressed, A “Cuckoo” gave to clear my chest. Now let me tell you how it makes My temper bubble when your shakes Prevent me in the foliage deep From getting half my beauty-sleep. The sense of honour must be slight That lets you carry on at night As if you thought the very stars Were glad to hear loquacious bars Of music of the fatal kind Is always pleased to lag behind. I hate those birds, I frankly say, That will not speak their thoughts by day, And, having spoken, will not pop Their heads beneath their wings, and stop. You love, undone by gift of gab, Your household chronicles to blab, Which bore the Finches till they long For men to fright you from your song. Give me the bird that knows his mind, And sings it when the sun is kind! Give me that gentlemanly bird Not eager for the final word! Not one in whom a twisted sense Of honour causes keen offence To folk who have a perfect right, When prayers are said, to sleep at night. If you were twenty times more brief, 'Twould prove a valuable relief To birds who'd give me any sum To teach you how at last to come From all those agitated squeaks To follow economic beaks. With more of sense, and less of tongue, You'd learn the art of keeping young By putting out the eggs to hatch And never sharing what you catch, Instead of toiling to produce A cottage for your private use. Since Mistress Pipit chirps with glee While bringing up a son for me, I should not like, upon my word, To disappoint the little bird; Besides, what folly to invest Your total in a single nest! A Cuckoo's brain is cool and brisk; It counts the cost, divides the risk, And never snubs a family That offers board and lodging free. If you would learn to imitate The wisdom of a Cuckoo's pate, Instead of squeaking in a thorn From early eve till early morn, And teaching silly Owls to make The night more hideous with a shake, You'd cease to be a scourge, and find Yourself a credit to your kind.” Just here the Nightingale assumed The look of one by deafness doomed, As if the Cuckoo were a bird Too grossly vulgar to be heard. This done, so hard he wagged his bill, The Cuckoo felt extremely ill, And left the wounded Nightingale To tire his beak in Cowslip Vale. 'Tis only fair for me to add That if he made the valley glad By pouring out so very long The rapid river of his song, Then valleys easily conceal The joy the Poets say they feel. THE FIRST EGG My dearest Robin, let me beg That you will keep this splendid egg A secret from the cat. I fear she noticed you last week With strips of bedding in your beak, And guessed what you were at. Don't sing a boastful melody About it in a lilac-tree, But fly a field away And bubble over with delight Till evening changes into night And starry holiday. The egg's a credit to your mate! Please tell her I congratulate You both in hearty terms. For colour, smoothness, shape and size It's such an egg as I should prize, If I could feed on worms. We human creatures, when our joy Is busy with a girl or boy, Risk nothing if we shout. Because our happy hearts are full, Delicious bragging is the rule, And handing babes about. But since, because of mice and rats, We can't put muzzles on our cats, I think I ought to speak. Believe me, Robin, it is best, Though song is aching in your breast, For you to—hold your beak! SEE-SAW My darlings, would you like to know About a bear named Esau, Who loved to have a bit of fun At night by playing see-saw? He learned by watching from the wood The woodman's children play the game, As woodmen's children should. When moonlight shone, and every tree Looked rather like a ghost, The little bear, with Ursula, The merry friend he loved the most, Away from home would quickly run, And in the children's playground have An hour or two of fun. The Moon was pleased to watch them romp Together on the plank. First Esau rose toward the sky, And then toward the earth he sank, While Ursula with grunts and squeals Pushed very hard upon the ground Her pair of furry heels. But suddenly the laughing Moon Was terrified to see The vexed and sleepy mother-bear Approach by stealth from tree to tree! She tried her best to cry aloud, But failed, so very kindly popped Behind a big black cloud. The moment when the creaking plank Was level in the air The mother smote it with her paw And roughly stopped the happy pair. “Go home at once! and do not speak, You naughty rogues! And, Esau, mind!— No honey for a week!” So, Darlings, as I thought you'd like To hear a tale of Esau, The bearikin who used to love At night a game of see-saw, I set it down in simple rhyme. What else I hear of him I'll tell To you another time. FORGOTTEN When Jesus saw the shavings drop And litter all His father's shop He must have laughed with joy at those Increasing playmates of His toes. The toddling Saviour often stood Among the yellow curls of wood And heard the tune of Joseph's plane Sound clear, then pause, then sound again. I wish that we could come upon, In Luke or Matthew, Mark or John, A record of His loveliness When yet a child, His toys, His dress. I wonder if He used to sow The seed of flowers and help them grow By water from the stream that ran In whispers to His tilted can; Or if He tumbled on the ground Because a puppy's loving bound Surprised His little strength and made His Mother's bosom half-afraid; Or if He scattered corn to bring The pigeons round Him in a ring, And shouted when He saw them glide In flocks above the countryside; Or if He learnt at Mary's knees The names of animals and trees, And fought, a scholar very young, With words too heavy for His tongue. The Saints who wrote the Gospels penned The work and suffering of our Friend, But clean forgot the Heavenly Boy's Companionship with earthly toys. THE QUARREL Over fields of growing bread Bluest heavens were spread. On the pond a duck was floating, In the tree a thrush was noting What her husband said. When, beside a bush of laurel, Ruth and Jim began to quarrel, Half the brightness of the day Seemed at once to pass away. 'Twas as if a cloud were spread Over fields of infant bread; 'Twas as if a gloomy duck Grumbled at his want of luck. What had been a major key Changed to minor in the tree, Since the bird, becoming sad, Cried that all the eggs were bad! Suddenly the heart of Ruth Ran from Temper back to Truth Just when Jim, extremely red, Blushed for what his tongue had said. So, beside the bush of laurel, Love again defeated Quarrel, Using, to make sure of this, Sob and hug and violent kiss! Uncle Hilary let down All the wrinkles of his frown; Never, never had the wheat More enjoyed a meal of heat; Seemingly the duckling pressed Ripples off a braver chest, Loudly hearing, while he paddled, That, so far from being addled, All the eggs deserved to be Honoured in a major key. A CONVERSATION If I speak some words to you, Woodwren almost out of view, Will your Feathered Highness be Tame and talkative for me? Should your honesty intend What becomes a quiet friend, Fond of woodbirds, small or big, I will twitter from a twig. Thank you, Madam! If I think What you say is fit for ink, Shall I rhymingly express All of it for James and Jess? Please report in tinkling words How myself and fellow-birds, Being dignified, detest Human fingers in a nest. Since I still have space enough Left for scribbles on a cuff, I will take a note or two Of this conference with you. Were my husband not away, He would ask of you to say What he thinks of arms and legs Climbing up a tree for eggs. Let him trust me. I shall write Sympathetic words to-night From a heart prepared to love Nuthatch, Creeper, Woodwren, Dove. Thank you, Sir, a thousand times! Thanks for sympathy and rhymes! Never was, since eggs began, Such a loving gentleman! GRANNIE The west is faded, like a stubble-field, The sun no longer keeps the meadow hot; The darkened brook is glad to lull To rest the young forget-me-not. Albreda! Ellen! Margaret! The dew is busy, and the grass is wet, And dreams are running to the violet. Lambs of my heart, come in! (She waits) The Earth has turned her back upon the sun To find the covey of the milk-white stars; The thrush is tuning in the pear, At intervals, his bedtime bars. Albreda! Ellen! Margaret! A dream is flowering in the violet, The wind is chilly, and the turf is wet. Lambs of my heart, come in! (She waits) Listen! Your quiet Uncle now begins To tell the keyboard all that Fancy floats From heart and brain, and makes it sound Along the ivory street of notes. Albreda! Ellen! Margaret! Since honest Dew has now to pay her debt In liquid pearls, the grass is very wet. Lambs of my love, run in! (They run to her) CHARLIE AND THE SUN Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Leave the little bench Where you sit and worry English into French! Two-ing, four-ing, nine-ing— Throw them all away! Overhead is shining Big Round Holiday! Gallop to the Study, Kiss your Daddy's face, Tell him trees are buddy, Challenge him to race! Tell him how I spied you Sitting all alone, Weariness inside you Heavy as a stone. Tell him how my finger Wrote upon the floor, Using gold, Don't linger, Charlie, any more! Looking back, I find him (Curlier than you), Gild the floor behind him, Saunter into view. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Leave the little bench Where you sit and worry English into French! Tell him how I banished Drudgery and care. Tell him how he vanished, Faster than a hare! Cheques can wait for signing, Books be tossed away. Overhead is shining Big Round Holiday! THE GREEDY BOY It nearly turns my brown hair white To think of Edgar's greediness! Some persons say that he was quite As gobbling as a leopardess, However this may be, I know He always cleared his plate before His brother (Dick) and sister (Flo), And hammered with his spoon for more. In spite of Nurse, he used to grab The largest round of buttered toast. Who chanced to get the smallest slab He didn't care, if he had most! One day he went at three o'clock To Ivy House for romping games With such a merry-hearted flock Of boys and girls with pretty names! He wanted Susie's spotted horse, And all the toys, and all the fun; And when the food appeared, of course He roughly snatched the biggest bun. When tea was over, he began To kick, and pull his mouth askew, Because he envied tiny Nan Her red and yellow cockatoo. At last his Nurse said, “Edgar Board, You don't deserve this pleasant treat. Come home at once!” How Edgar roared Along three hundred yards of street! His Mother, thinking him in pain, Rushed out to meet them in the hall, And cried (as Mothers will), “Why, Jane, What's making Master Edgar bawl?” The boy exclaimed, “Well, even you Would want to punish Nancy Relf! She's bought a lovely cockatoo And gone and kept it all herself!” THE DISAPPOINTMENT Unless my Lily blossoms soon I mean to mope and cry. However blue and gold the day, She dawdles hour by hour away; I can't imagine why. As Mary's darling now has bloomed, And Christopher's as well, It grieves me more than Mother knows When petals simply won't unclose For me to praise and smell. Because her buds are rather brown I fear that she is ill. Do Lilies sicken for the Mumps, Or any other kind of lumps? Or suffer from a chill? I'm puzzled. There is something wrong, But what, I cannot guess. The Gardener only rubs his chin And screws his nose when I begin To speak of my distress. It's usual for my Uncle John To give me good advice, But yesterday he said, “My Pet, If Lilies fail, there's Mignonette, Who's really rather nice.” I know there is; and Charity, And Thrift, and London Pride, And Columbine, who dearly loves To have a dovecot full of doves That mustn't leave her side. But early in the Spring I chose This Lily-plant instead, And kissed her stem a hundred times And told her all the pretty rhymes I carry in my head. I shan't desert her just because She has a secret pain. The promise made, to love her best, However beautiful the rest, I whisper once again. Unless she blossoms very soon, I mean to mope and cry. Though warm and blue and gold the day, She dawdles hour by hour away; Can no one tell me why? THE BAITED TRAP “So this,” said Nibbler Mouse, “Is another cheesey house. What a very level floor! What a captivating door!” “But Grannie often said, While she wagged her charming head, Silky, if you want to make Flesh by eating currant cake, Or long to be the pride Of a larder-loving bride, Swear upon your bended knees Not to fall a prey to cheese. If caught, you soon will find All the worthlessness of rind. Silky, what's the end of that? Sudden funeral in a cat! “So this,” said Nibbler Mouse, “Is another cheesey house. Ornamental, I admit. Tempting? Not one little bit!” THE SPONGE I met the Spirit of the Frost, And she was crying, crying, As if each pane of glass were lost, And lakes and ponds were dying. Because, when I had first begun My climbing and my leaping, An anxious Mother used to run To kiss away my weeping, I stopped; and since she did not speak, I dared, becoming bolder, To stroke the coldness of a cheek, And pat a heaving shoulder. “Listen!” I said. “For many a year, In many an English county, I've stood amazed to see your clear And silver-seeming bounty; And now that we at last have met (Though sorrowful the meeting) I want to pay the heavy debt I owe to you, my Sweeting. Look up! and tell me, if you can, The nature of the trouble; For grieving lonely is a plan That makes a sorrow double.” By listening to the words I used, Poor Frost at last relented, And told me how her heart was bruised, And why she thus lamented. “The Sun's so very hard to please With early morning posies. I draw for him a million trees And ferns and Christmas roses, And daffodils, and butterflies With winter gems all over, And mignonette of baby size, And sparkling heads of clover; But yet he rubs on every sheet Of glass his sponge, and never Is kind enough to say, How sweet! Or, How intensely clever! “Last night I ran from pane to pane To find the breath of sleepers And use it—though, alas! in vain— For loops of flowering creepers. The Moon, attentive while I worked To make the breathing settle, Will tell you that I never shirked A leaf or stem or petal. A comet ran along the sky To see the beauty clearer, And all the stars began to try To press a little nearer. 'Twas such enchanting work, I felt, As anybody clever, So far from wishing it to melt, Would want to keep for ever. “Dear Friend, whose hand was softly laid In love upon my shoulder, I wish that Father Time had made Immeasurably colder The Sun, who tumbled out of bed This morning in a passion And shook a disapproving head, According to his fashion. He raised his golden sponge; he jeered At every window gleaming With icy loveliness, and smeared The beauty past his dreaming. He dabbed and dabbed. Because I knew Each masterpiece was dying, As though a drop of summer dew, I screamed, and burst out crying!” MICAWBER Where is your April radiance gone, You damp and out-at-elbows bird Now speaking in this bitter tone Your long and melancholy word? Delights for lemon-coloured bill In winter days 'tis hard to see, But you are counting chances still, Micawber of the balcony! Humped in a ball of discontent, You look as if you mean to cry For showers of manna to be sent At once from out the leaden sky. Considering Fate, you scarcely note A single joy upon the list, But ponder underneath your coat The gospel of a pessimist. The bird that fiercely pecked all day The coloured berries of the wild, When Autumn fed him, seems to say, I want to be your Charity-Child; So, just to tell us he is near, Sudden from out his bosom starts That canting whine—how sad! how clear!— To move, and even wound, our hearts. Have done with jaundice in your look, My winged relation of the air! For master, mistress, housemaid, cook Have pleasant odds-and-ends to spare. Two eager girls, as deputies Of Santa Claus, in leaping frocks, Shall run to spread beneath the trees The suet of your Christmas-box. NATURE SPEAKS “Here's a piece of work for you,” Said their Mistress to the Brambles. “Keep on working! Industry Means delightful country rambles. Since this lane is rather dull, Being mostly quick and nettles, Let it learn how fair a fruit Follows your display of petals!” “Here's a piece of work for you,” Said her Mistress to the Heather. “All your fire-bewildered roots Now must set to work together! Laugh as I would have you laugh, Most ingenious merrymaker, While you dress for me again Every burnt and blackened acre!” “Here's a piece of work for you,” Said her Mistress to the Bracken. “Never, till the task is done Tenderly and nobly, slacken! Where the woodmen felled the pines (Stricken at the post of duty) Flood, in memory of the dead, All the open space with beauty!” LOVE IN ENGLAND Love, who sprang from bed in haste, Pulled the blind up, quickly dressed, Tied an apron round her waist, Hummed the music in her breast. “Here's my dawn and here's my day, Here's my English work,” she said; “Here's the chance to give away Loaves of love, the perfect bread.” “Now that England's up again, Not a minute must be lost; Not a second, weak and vain, Used for sums of care and cost. Mine the splendid recipe Never known to fail!” she said; “All that wish can have from me Loaves of love, the perfect bread!” “Trust my oven! Come in throngs Over hill and stream and moor, Gay with laughter, glad with songs, Multitudinous at my door! Bringing baskets you have kept Idle hitherto,” she said, “Bless my baking, and accept Loaves of love, the perfect bread!” “You that labour at the bench, You that toil within the shop, You that dig the celery trench, You that sow the cornland crop, Fill your baskets! If you lack Twice as much again,” she said, “Run to me, and carry back Loaves of love, the perfect bread!” CERTAINLY NOT He runs across the plain Of blueness without end, His pockets full of gold To give to every friend. In August year by year His rapid servant comes To mark with pink and red The shoulders of the plums; To make the apple stare As fixedly as once When Eve forgot a rule, And Adam was a dunce; To freckle Baby's soft And silky inch of nose, And bronze in half a day A million seaside toes. But though, as all admit, He's capable of more Than fifty Aunts could tell From two o'clock till four, However much he thinks, However hard he tries, However long he plans, The Sun can never rise. When August disappears, September, brown and blithe, Is ready for the Sun To flash along the scythe; To kiss from green to black The berries soon to stain The pinafores and thumbs Of madcaps in the lane; To heat upon his bush The thorn-defended sloe, And dye his glossy face As dark as indigo; To teach the hazel-nut The tightness of a shell That holds him while he learns The way he ought to swell. But though, as all admit, He's capable of more Than Poets could explain From two o'clock till four, However long he skulks Behind a cloud, to fret, And bite his nails, and frown, The Sun can never set. THE CHRISTMAS ROBIN Though Frost, ere the afternoon closes, Is busy with silver-leaf roses To cover my pane, Come, chirp on the sill and be handy, You nimble and delicate dandy From Crab-Apple Lane! The ballads I never wish muted Are those by your bravery fluted In cherry and lime. Then open the beak that rehearses For Spring the delicious blank verses Too lovely for rhyme. Suppose me a captive, enduring The grave of a dungeon immuring Himself and his star, And sing as if Blondel were humming Of cowslips in England while strumming His loyal guitar. With breast like a rose, on the coping You blossom while heartily hoping For crumbs to appear. Such food as I have for your eating Is little to pay you, my Sweeting, For half that I hear. 'Tis said, when the Saviour was bleeding For hearts that were cold and unheeding, A forefather tried To staunch with a kerchief of feather, Where steel and His flesh met together, The wound in His side. If so, in a beautiful fashion You preach from the text of His Passion Without any words, And seem, as a comforter sainted By Christ on the Cross, ere He fainted, The dearest of birds.</field>
