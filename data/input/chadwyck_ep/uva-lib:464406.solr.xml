The Prologve Sen into Courts is Curiositie, Manheid, maners, nurtour and courtasie, Gif in the heid greit vertew dois auance Sa in members I think siclyke suld be. Curage, kyndnes, gentrice and honestie To do the heid seruice and obseruance, To God alone also for his plesance And failzeing that, all is bot fantasie, For warldlie myrth wald haue sum temperance. Sum cummis to court to serue thair King and Quene To conqueis lands sum settis thair courage clene, Greit Lordis and Lairdis the court wald hald in hand Sum thair kynnismen to Court causis conuene. Sum for to se, and vthers to be sene. With braid Buklars brawling with birneist brand Sum thair gat fais, vthers sum friendschip fand Sum gettis plesure, vthers gettis tray and tene Ze ken the Court can nocht ay stabill stand. In Court that time was gude Dauid Lyndsay, In vulgar toung he bure the bell that day To mak meter, richt cunning and expart, And Maister Iohne Ballentyne suith to say Mak him marrow to Dauid weill we may. And for the thrid, Maister Williame Stewart, To mak in Scottis, richt weill he knew that Art, Bischop Durie, sum tyme of Galloway, For his plesure sum tyme wald tak thair part. And I my self with small Intelligence Thocht in that case to schaw my diligence To manifest my waik wit and Ingyne, At thir foursum asking leif and licence, With hat and hand k[n]eiling with reuerence Me for to leir ane lessoun or a lyne Of thair prettick to me ane point propyne. They said go to, schaw sum Experience And I thairfoir to thame promeist the wyne. Sa at thir four, quhen I had leif purchest, To thame (said I) quhat mater is metest? For to begin (quod thay) we wald ze drew Sum Dialog, or argument that is best, And that will mak zour mater manifest. Sa folk may knaw the fals Tale be the trew, For Dialogs (quod I) weis get anew. And sa fra thame Incontinent me drest, And tuke gude nicht, and said gude schirs adew. Bot zit knew not quhat my mater suld be Quhidder of myrth or zit of grauitie. Efter Supper to bed I maid me boun, Sa in my sleip me thocht I saw swythlie Lady Venus, cumming and spak to me, And said I am cum with the for to ressoun, Thairfoir my wordis, se that thow not chessoun, Tuitching my stait, honour and dignitie Forzet me nocht quhen thou makis thy Sermoun. Sa on the morne quhen time was for to ryse I thocht I wald begin my Interpryse, And rememberit on Venus Lady Quene Kest in my mynd ofter nor anis or twyse That she bad me with hir mater auyse, And I knew small quhat hir mater did mene Considdering at me hir self had bene. I wist nocht weill quhat mater to deuyse, Hir for to pleis, and to eshaip hir tene. And sa at schort my pen I tuke in hand Began to wryte at Quene Venus command Ane lytill Quair, I ken nocht gif ze knaw it, Embrowd about with barbarus termes bland And with trym termes maist vsit vp on land As to the Name Dame Venus Court they caw it I wait nocht weill gif euir Schiris ze saw it, Delyuerit it vnto my Maisters four Quha it ressauit, and reddelie red ouir. This lytill Quair, quhen thay had red and endit Sum said that hard, thay greitlie it commendit, And sa beliue delyuerit it againe To euerie verse thairin thay condiscendit, And said thay wist, thairwith nane was offendit Except it war ane prydfull pure Putane, At quhais wordis men wald tak small disdane, Quha that fand faltis, all four thay wald defend it Be word and deid, with micht and all thair mane. Ane proper wenche come to me on ane day Ane of my Ants, bot thairto I say nay My buke to borrow, greitlie scho did Inquyre Ane wed thairfoir scho said scho wald doun lay Quhill scho it red, within ane Oulk or tway.

Thairfoir Maistres I mon hald zow excusit, I traist sic termes befoir few tymes ze vsit, Or at the leist, ze come nocht quhair thay grew I hard sum say that ze war greitlie rusit, And ze zour thocht and mynde on sic termes musit Baith into Greik, in Latine and Hebrew, Now I persaue that thay Tales ar not trew. Thairfoir trewlie my self suld haue the pyne, I was to bald to cast Peirlis to the Swyne. Than scho me prayit with wordis sweit and fair To be sa gude to tak ane vther Quair In planer termes, and it in Meter mak Anents wemen, not tuitching thame sa sair, For zour requeist (said I) I will do mair. Ane vther Roll I chancit in hand to take, It to performe for that fair Ladyis sake. Maid and compylit be the wyse Sages seuin, Quha was that tyme maist sapient vnder heuin. For naturall wit, thay ar all haldin plane The springing well, and onlie fresche Fontane The perfyte ground, and rute Originall Of this storie, now following but lane, Thairfoir my self, as now I am constrane It to translait, in our toung naturall. Quhair I it fand into plain prois at all Without cullour or feit, now I againe In rurall ryme, to set it furth I sall. The fault I said, for hir saik I suld mend it Quhair scho befoir with strange termis was offendit. I promeist hir of honestie to quyte thame, And with toun termes my bow it suld be bendit Fra Clerklie termes my pen suld be suspendit And in my verse be na way I suld wryte thame, Ze sall all knaw doutles that I despyte thame. On this debait than we war condiscendit, At hir desyre I sall eschew to dyte thame.

Incontinent but ony mair delay I thocht it best my pen for till assay This lytill buke in verse for to compyle Quhair it befoir into plane prois was ay, Gif I culd fynd ony gude wyle or way To steir it vp into ane better style, That I suld not this fair Lady begyle, Considdering the same on hand I tuke As ze sall heir, thus I began my buke. Finit Prologus. To the Reidar. Becavs I was reprouit of befoir, That I suld not in Clerklie termes gloir: Bot in plaine speiche my buik for to addres With commoun talk, bot zit neuer the les This Tale of auld I hard quhilk is richt trew, And richt weill knawin, that neid oft makis vertew Thairfoir on force, becaus strange termes I want I haue na dout, bot heir thay sall be skant. Thairfoir in tyme I think best to deny thame, Zone fair Lady me think scho settis nocht by yame Ane vther caus siclike I wait ze ken For to bring but its Ill thats not thair ben. Nor thair is nane, I wait in all this toun Except he haue it, that can put on ane goun. Of ane twme Twn, nane can draw out licour, Nor of ane fule to make a wise Doctour. For quhy wit wants, quhair wisdome suld cum fra Into this case, the mater stands sa. Force me compellis, strange termes to forbeir, Within my box thairs few to get or leir. Quhair Gold is skant, siluer mon vs content, Euen sa it stands but dout at this present. Praying hartlie this Tale in patience tak, A man can sell nathing out of his pak Bot as he hes, than present for the tyme, Ze may persaue that be this roustie ryme. Beseiking zow gude Reidars to excuse it, Not to detract, nor zit ouir hie to ruse it. This I wald wis my freinds ze wald do so, Than in Goddis name to purpois lat vs go. Heir beginnis the seuin Seages, translatit furth of prois in Scottis meter be Iohne Rolland in Dalkeith. In Eldaris dayis oft times it hes bene tauld That Rome hes bene ane Cietie of the auld Of cunning Clerks, &amp; wonder vail?eand men, As ancient Acts makis vs for to ken. Ouir all the warld it had Preeminence, All pepill maid to it Obedience. With greit Captanes, Kings Knichts &amp; Empreours Kene men of weir, &amp; cruell Conquerours, Of townis and towris, greit villages &amp; cieteis, Triumphand far abone thair Enemeis: Subdewand thame to lestand seruitude, Not regarding thair lynage, kyn nor blude. C?quest grit realmes, lordschips &amp; rowms braid Thair commoun weill sa meruellous riche they maid That all co?treis &amp; k?gdomes th? about Of thair fell feir greit dreddour had and dout. That thay on force behuid to mak homage Or ellis haue loist baith life and heritage. For they war sa repleit of all riches Win into weiris be martiall besynes. Thay tuke na cure of na m?nis fauour nor feid Sa thay become of all the warld the heid: And had thairof the haill Authoritie, Bot this was not in time of Papistrie, For fra that time y? Papis was maid in Rome, Of all vertew that Cietie was maid tome. And day be day fra all vertew decrest Continuallie the self it ay opprest. For thre strangers rais vp in that Cietie. Quhilkis of befoir na way wald sufferit be, The commoun weill caus thay war ay agane Thairin thairfoir thay wald not thole remane Bot fra Papis come that Nobill towne within It did abound sa sair in deidly sin, And that na stait to Clergie was compairs, Sa weill thay treit thir thre vncouth strangairs Quhilk thre thir was, the first lurkand haitrent The secund was, ?oung counsall and consent, Singular profite it was the thrid I wis, Quhilk thre was caus to gar Rome go amis. And causit it tine the greit triumphand Name, And to be callit the hous of warldlie schame. Tint the greit rowmes and warldlie possessio?s That thay conquest fra diuers vther Crowns. All sic become throw wickitnes and vice, Of the Papists, and thair foule Merchandice. For thay wald gar ane pound of meltit leid Bring thame againe the wecht of golde sa reid. And gar the hippis of ane deid ?ow or skin Assol?e ?ow of all ?our deidly sin, Incontinent in heuin vp to be brocht, Contrair Gods will, quhidder he wald or nocht. Bot not the les, lang tyme befoir thir dayis Ane Empreour was as the Storie sayis, Quhilk hecht to Name Pontianus at richt, Ane Nobill man of wisdome and of micht. Gydit his Realme be wisdome and vertew, To his pepill exempilis daylie schew, Of wisdome wit and Liberalitie, Quhairthrow the hartis of all his folk wan he That nane cairit to wair with him thair life, Ane Kings Douchter he had vnto his wife, Callit Clara, ane woman verteous, Fair and gudelyke, and wonder gracious. Quhilk ane knaif chyld of him scho did c?saue Bot him alone, na ma God to thame gaue, Quhilk was callit Dioclesiane to Name, Fair and weill fauourit, baith of fassoun &amp; fame Quha daylie grew in vertew and gudnes, Ilk man him lufit for his greit gentilnes. For he was courtes, cumlie and richt kynd, Fra all fulische alluterlie declynd. Sa quhen he was seuin ?eir auld or neir by This Emprice tuke ane meruellous malady, That scho behuid for to tak bed on force, With sair seiknes sa troublit was hir Corce. Persauing weill be hir Intelligence For to eschew fra deid was na defence Bot of hir life schortlie to haue ane end, Sa for hir spous the Empreour sone scho send. With humbill hart and Inwartlie praying, That he wald cum to hir but tarying. Gif euer he wald se hir vpon lyue Sa was fra hand direct sone ane Missyue. Poist efter Poist, quhair he lay in weilfair, Sone till him come, and culd the caus declair, But mair abaid, with wonder sorie hart, With few hors men fra his Camp did depart. And quhen he come to the Emprice presence Scho said till him with humbill reuerence. O My gude Lord, howbeit that I be seik, Ze licent me my erand to ?ow speik. Sa that it be onlie to ?our plesour, And als siclike vnto ?our greit honour, He said Lady I se ?ow in diseis Notwithstanding say on quhat euer ?e pleis: And it sall be to me na vilanie, Sa it eik not ?our greit Infirmitie. My Lord scho said, This seiknes I persaue Or it depart will driue me to my graue. He said Madame be ?e of gude comfort, Ze will recouer ?our helth I traist at schort, For I sall send for all my ding Doctouris, Phisitianes, and my Philosophouris, My cunning men, and my Medicinars, My Cirugians and als my Potingars, My Practicianes quhilkis ar suttell and slie. That daylie deilis with Flewbothomie. Thay will consult, and Ilkane als persaue All ?our seiknes, and sa helth sall ?e haue For seiknes is als naturall als heill, Thairfoir dout not y? deith sall with ?ow deill, At this present, bot ?e sall sone recure. Quod scho my Lord of a thing I am sure, This maladie sa haldis me at the hart Quhill I be deid, na way it will depart. Quhairfoir my Lord, richt humblie I require, Ze wald Incline ?our hart to my desyre. He said desire at me quhat euer ?e will, I will it grant, thocht it be contrair skill To comfort ?ow, and help ?ow fra diseis Thairfoir say on, it sall me not displeis. Scho said my Lord I thank ?ow gretumlie, Quod he Madame say on quhat euer it be. Scho said my Lord, plesit ?our Nobill grace Of my desyre, this is the verray cace, Quhen I depart out of this present lyfe. It will ?ow pleis to haue ane vther wyfe, And as ?e knaw we haue na barne bot ane, Nor neuer had, bot onlie him allane: Quhilk ouir all thing anixt ?our awin persoun I wald war weill to this Ilk prouisioun. Efter ?our deith with all wit and wisdome, Reule his pepill, and gyde this greit Kingdome And ouir all thing my Lord maist I requyre Into this point, ?e will grant my desyre, That ?our Emprice perch?ce quhat euer scho be Vpon my Sone haue na Authoritie, Na Gouernance, power nor ?it gyding Bot ?e him put to vther nurisching. Far fra hir sicht, and fra hir companie, To that effect, that he may viceles be, Of all vices, and sic thing as gais wrang And ay to be, greit cunning men amang. My Lord hartly this humblie I requyre Into this point to fulfill my desyre. For weill I knaw, displesours ar to cum That he sall do, or ellis he salbe dum, Quhairthrow onlie his lyfe he will recure, My Lord I knaw but dout this salbe sure He said Lady ?our will ?e sall not want, Thocht it war mair, richt hartly I it grant, For that is my desyre asweill as ?ouris It salbe done, Madame at ?our plesouris. Scho said my Lord I thank ?ow with my hart God saue ?our grace, for now I moste depart This being said, scho tuke ane fell passioun And ane lang space scho lay in deidly swoun. Sa in schort tyme withouttin mair remeid, Hir naturall det scho completit of deid. With all triumph hir funerall seruice Was dewlie done, as that time was the gyse Lang time efter the Empreour maid murning, And all his Court, for hir sair departing Na menstrell myrth nor ?it na merines Into his hall was sene nor na blyithnes, Bot heuines, greit dule and grauitie Into the Court, and all the companie For that gude Quene, all solace was away, Woir the dule weid Ilk ane for ?eir and day. Moralitas. Of this mater sum thing we may collect Of this Emprice hauand sa greit respect And Inwart lufe vnto hir Sone alone Of hir awin helth scho tuke bot lytill rek, Bot thocht scho wald his weilfair nocht neglect Befoir to deith hir self scho wald dispone Quhilk causit hir sic maters to propone To hir husband, for the samin effect Hir Sone to ring efter that scho was gone. Siclyke ?e may considder the greit cair The thocht and mynde scho tuke baith lait and air, Anent hir Sone scho suffering sair seiknes Prouyding als for his welth and weilfair, Desyring him of cummers to be clair With the new Quene, he suld haue na entres, Nor scho with him in ony besynes, For sum causis that micht occur perchance That scho suld haue of him na Gouernance. Alswa appeiris sum part of Prophecie, And greit foirsicht hes bene in this Ladie, Perrellis to cum, sa perfytelie to knaw Scho being tuichit with sair Infirmitie. Praying to put, hir Sone fra companie Of all the Court, and als of Ladyis aw. And in speciall, fra his Mother in Law. Inconuenients to eschew that micht be Sa scho desyrit, hir Sone him for to draw. The hartlie lufe siclyke ?e may persaif, That this Lady to hir husband did haif, Randring to him, honour and reuerence, And he to hir, siclyke all things gaue, That scho desyrit, or at him scho wald craue: Not regarding, thocht it had bene offence, And for hir saik, quhen scho was deid and hence He commandit that na blyithnes suld be For ?eir and day into his companie. Thairfoir I say to ?ow in Mariage Baith into auld, and into tender age, Quhat euer chance, ?e suld haue Cheritie Giue Ill wordis cum, than lat ?our malice swage, Giue place to Ire, and harbrie not outrage, Crabit at anis, na way baith ?e suld be Ane meik answer slokins Melancolie, ?e ar conionit ane fleshe and Saulis twa, Than keip gude lufe, the Scripture biddis sa. How the Empreour committit and delyuerit his Sone to the seuin Doctouris of Rome to leir. This Empreour vpon a tyme he lay Intill his bed, and to him self culd say I haue na barnis bot ane Sone to my air, I think it best that he war put to lair, Sen he is ?oung, and into tender age To leir wisdome he wil tak mair curage Efter my deith, this Realme that he may gyde This I think best in tyme for to prouyde. Sa on the morne he cryit efter his clais, And in dew tyme but mair abaid vprais. Gart call his Lords, and counsall till him sone, In this mater quhat thay thocht to be done. Schawing to thame at lenth the haill mater To his Lady quhat he had promeist air Thay answerit all, my Lord thair is in Rome Seuin wysest men that is in Cristindome, Quhilkis in learning all vther thay preuaill In all wisdome, and Science Liberaill Thay ar but dout the seid of Salomon, For to discus Problewm or ?it Questioun. Lat ane Message to thame be send but mair Delyuer thame ?our Sone vnto the lair Of thair counsall the Empreour was content, For thir Doctours ane Message sone was sent, Vnder his Seill, and als his awin hand writ To the Doctouris he had deliuer it. Sa sone as thay the letters all had red To thair veyage but tary sone thame sped Quhen thay come to the Empreours presence Thay salust him with laude and reuerence, On thair best wise, as to thame culd effeir He said to thame ?e ar all welcum heir. I speir at ?ow haue ?e ony knawlege Quhairfoir I send to ?ow seuin my Message. Thay answerit him, the caus na way we knaw Quhill y? ?our grace will witchaif for to schaw Zour graces will quhen ?e haue schawin vs to That to fulfill, our power we sall do. To quhome he said, I thank ?ow Maisters all Now vnto ?ow my erand schaw I sall. Ane Sone alone, na ma barnis I haue, Nor all my time na ma God to me gaue: Appeirandlie he is to be mine air, Thairfoir I wald he war put to the lair: To cunning men for to haue thair doctrine, And in ?outh heid be vnder Discipline, To that effect, efter my fatall det Into my place with honour he be set, To reule his Realme with wisdome and Iustice Quhilk in ane Prince suld euer ring alwayis. Thairfoir I wald ?e seuin suld him ressaue, And him to leirne, and into gyding haue, And ?e sall be rewardit weill thairfoir, Sa haill and feir agane ?e him restoir. Thay thankit him all seuin with reuerence, That he to thame of his Sone gaue credence. Bot the first Maister callit Pantyllas Began and said, becaus he eldest was, My Lord I sall, and pleis ?our Nobill grace Caus ?our ane Sone within seuin ?eiris space, Be als cunning in all the seuin Science, Of wit, wisdome, and all Intelligence As I, and all my marrowis that heir standis Or ony man, within ?our boundis and landis Sa that ?e will deliuer him to me, This sall I do in pane of honestie. The secund Maister namit Lentalus, Thir wordis said vnto the Empreour thus. And pleis ?our grace deliuer him to me Within sex ?eiris he sall haue mair Clergie, Mair cunning craft in all the seuin Science Nor I and all that now is in presence. And as ?e knaw I haue seruit ?our grace Sen I was man, in all my lyfis space. And for rewaird I seik na vther thing Bot ?our ane Sone to haue in gouerning. Than spak the thrid y? namit was Craton With ?our gude grace I saillit the sey vpon, In greit perrellis, and dangerous weilfair And of ?our grace rewaird I seik na mair, To be sa gude, to me deliuer wald Zour onlie Sone in gouernance to hald, And I promeis that within ?eiris fiue He sall be mair cunning and Scientiue, Nor I, and all my marrowis heir about Vnto ?our grace this I sall do but dout. Than spak the fourt to name hecht Malquydrak And pleis ?our grace my seruice for to tak In gude sessoun, in thankis and plesouris For I my self, and my Progenitouris Hes seruit ?ow, and ?ours our lyfis space And na rewaird desire I of ?our grace Bot to witchaif on me sa greit credence, As for to leir ?our Sone perfite Science: And for to be of cunning mair perfite Nor I, and all my marrowis can Indite. This sall he do within nixt ?eiris four. Or I Science and cunning sall gif ouir. Th? spak the fyft, Iosephus hecht his name Lord I am auld, and neuer vndefame On ?our counsall, and hes bene mony ?eir, Wald ?e leif me ?our ane Sone for to leir I sall him teiche bot dout in ?eiris thre Als greit cunning, and als perfite Clergie As I my self, and all my marrowis can, Or ellis ?e sall call me na honest man. Na mair rewaird of ?our grace I desire Thocht all my life I haue seruit ?our Impire. Than spak the sext was namit Cleophas Ane Nobill man, and cunning Clerk he was, And said siclike as the laif said befoir, Of ?our gude grace rewaird I seik no moir Bot ?our ane Sone to haue in gouerning Informe and teiche, and into Science bring In cunning he salbe within twa ?eir That he sall haue na peregall nor peir. Na mair rewaird at ?ow now ask will I Quhilk ?our gude grace I traist will not deny Than said the seuint greit Maister &amp; doctour, Vnto ?our grace I will do sic plesour, Giue me ?our Sone in credence and gyding Within ane ?eir I sall him giue leirning, Sa profoundlie in all the Science seuin, And of all Science vnderneth the heuin: That in wisdome he sall haue na compair Vnto ?our grace this schortlie I declair. For giftis of golde, nor geir I not regaird Nor for labouris I couet na rewaird Bot ?our gude will, quh? the ?eir is furth gane The Empreour hard, and th?kit thame Ilkane And said I am Indettit to ?ow all Vnrecompansit nane of ?ow thair be sall. Bot not the les sen I find ?ow sa kynd And w? gude willis hes schawin me ?our mynd Gif I suld him commit til ane of ?ow Than all the rest micht weill beleue and trow That to that ane I had mair affectioun Than to the rest, quhilk suld caus discentioun: Discord, Inuy, and also variance, Quhilk in na sort amang sic men suld chance. Thairfoir to ?ow coniunctlie all in ane Heir I commit my Sone Dioclesiane. My afald barne, and eik my onlie Air, With ?ow to be Instructit weill in lair. And him to gyde in alkin honest sort, Quhylis to wisdome, and quhylis to game &amp; sport: As ?e will answer Ilk ane vnto me, In pane of credence and of ?our honestie. For be he weill, euin sa I think my sell Do as ?e pleis, as now na mair I tell. Thir dyng Doctours the sweit langage heiring Of thair gude Lord, and alswa persauing The greit credence, and siclyke the kyndnes That he had schawin vnto thair sempilnes. Thay thankit him Ilk ane vpon thair kneis, Man efter man, all seuin in thair degreis. Sayand to him, that his grace suld be sure Of thair laubours greit diligence and cure. The Empreour tuke his Sone be the hand, And bad that he, at thair bidding suld stand. And in na sort that he suld thame offend Vnto the time agane he for him send. And sa at schort the barne delyuerit he, Quhome thay ressauit with all humilitie. This being done, Ilk ane thay tuke gude nicht To Romes Court the way thay held on richt. Thir seuin Maisters thair veyage passing on, Ane of thame said, quhilk namit was Craton To his fellowis, sayand my brether deir Sen we this Chylde in Gouerning hes heir, I think not best to Romes toun that we ryde Gif we list weill this barne gouerne and gyde: For diuers causis and Impediments, That may occur be Inconuenients. Tysting the Chylde to mony sport and play And to neglect his studie day by day. For fra greit men get knawledge quhat he be, Thay will couet daylie his companie, Sa fra studie he salbe ay abstractit, And we all seuin with greit displesure lackit. The vther sex said all with ane consent His counsall was gude and conuenient, And was said to the purpois by and by, And with gude will to the same wald apply. This to eschew, I wald remeid was found For weill I knaw within ane lytill ground To buylde vpon, thair is ane proper place, Quhilk to vs all war plesure and solace. Fra Romes toun bot thre myles distant, Quhat thing we neid, we myster not to want. Lat vs yair mak ane hous baith rowme &amp; squair Quhair at quyet the child may leirne his lair We sal gar paynt vpon the wallis about The seuin Science, with greit Storyis all out, Sa that this Childe may se vesie and luke, And tak doctrine, asweill as in his buke. This Counsall than applesit thame euer ilkane The hous was biggit sone of lyme and stane, And weill compleit, as it best culd effeir, Quhairin thay all, studyit the seuin ?eir. Quhilk bene outrun, and all compleit togidder The seuin Maisters amang thame did c?sidder That thay wald all exame Dioclesiane, Fra that thair terme of the seuin ?eir was gane, Gif that he was expert into Science, Considdering thay had done Diligence. Pantillas said, I can not tell trewlie How our Scoller examit weill salbe. Than said Craton I sall that weill deuise, Into his bed on sleiping quhen he lyis. Vnder Ilk nuik of his bed we sall lay Ane Oliue leif, than quhen approches day, Gif he persauis sone efter his walking That his bed is remouit ony thing, Than we may knaw be our Intelligence He is repleit of all the seuin Science. This being done, airlie in the morning The Childe walknit befoir the Sone rysing, And lyftit vp his Ene vnto the sky And to the rufe of the hous feruently, Baith to and fra, schairplie casting his Ene On sic fassoun befoir thay had not sene. The seuin Maisteris persauing perfitelie How his Ingyne was raisit sa quicklie: Thay said quhairfoir luk ?e sa fast about? Quhat mouis ?ow, or quhat haue ?e in dout? Schaw vs in plaine we sall caus to amend it Gif ony thing hes ?ow in hart offendit. Na maruell haue my gude Maisters (said he) For I am brocht in ane greit fantasie, Quhilk hes me maid richt fleit and als affeird, For in my sleip to me I thocht appeird: That the ruif tre of all this haill Maissoun, Vnto the eird was quyte declynit doun. And sine again in twinkling of our Eyis, It was vpliftit ane hundreth thousand greis, Quhilk put me in ane felloun fray but dout, Than his Maisters Ilk ane him round about, Persauit weill be gude Experience He was fulfillit of all the seuin Science. Gif he haue dayis and in gude companie Ane man of wit, and wisdome he salbe, That in the warld sall nane be till him peir, Sa at this tyme we leif this ?oung Childe heir. Moralitas. We may persaue na Empreour Nor King suld wirk at thair plesour. Without ane gude counsall, Gude counsall is the Procurour For to set fordwart gude laubour And perrellis dois expell. This Empreour he wald do nocht Quhill his Lordis was befoir him brocht And sa thay war richt sone, At thame his counsall than he socht, And thay him schew thair mynde and thocht Quhat best was to be done. In ane voce thay concludit thair That he suld put his Sone to lair With Cunning men of wit, Becaus the Counsall did it declair Incontinent but ony mair Fra hand fulfillit it. For as the Mother did prouyde, The Father on that vther syde For the Sone did foirse, Fra purpois wald na langer byde Bot to the Doctouris in that tyde His Sone delyuerit he. Thocht all thir Seuin had Science sene, ?e may persaue that thay haue bene Of thair awin Fantasie, All cassin into curage clene Ilk ane vther to prouene And purches Dignitie. Ilk ane thay tuke ane diuers dait, And promeist be thair awin consait Mair large nor thay wald do, Quhilk was far by thair awin Estait For to pretend to gang the gait That thay culd not cum to. Bot the Empreour tuke weill in heid. He thocht he wald not tak the feid Of all, and pleis bot ane. For that he fand ane gude remeid For the haill seuin without mair pleid The Childe hes with thame tane. How the Empreour be counsall of his Princes, and Lordis of his Impyre weddit ane vther wyfe. In this meane time the Princes of honour, And the greit Lordis come to the Empreour, And said my Lord and pleis ?our nobill grace Heir we ar cum to schaw how standis the cace. Bot ane ?oung Childe, we knaw na moir ?e ha And plesit God, we wald that ?e had ma And it may stand be fatale destanie, That ?our ane Sone may Inlaik faill and die As God forbid, that sic ane thing suld chance, Zit not the les we wald mak puruyance. Than war we all of ane new natiue King Maid destitute abone vs for to ring, Quhairthrow strange folke &amp; vncouth natio?s Micht conqueis vs, and all our generatiounis. Quhilk neuer was sen this Impire began Conqueist, ouirthrawin with ony mortall man Sen Romulus, quhilk buyldit Romes toun, Was neuer man that had dominioun Of this Impire, but Nobill natiue Kingis, And to auoide sa greit and perrellous things: This is the caus we ar cum to ?our grace To schaw ?ow all the mater and the cace, That sic ane thing is richt abill to be To put the Realme furth of sic Ieopardie, We wald ?e tuke sum honest gay Ladie Zour Nobill Quene and bedfellow to be, To that effect successioun for to haue, And ?our Impire fra thir dangeris to saue. The Empreour than heirand all thair sawis, Quhat sic thing ment of the mater and caus. He thankit thame ane hundreth thousand syse, And said he wald do as thay did deuyse. Of thair counsall richt weill content he was, And thame requyrit to purpois for to pas. Ane Lady get that was of tender age, Baith gude and fair, and cum of hie lynage. And clene Virgin and lustie to behald, Than sall I do the same thing that ?e wald. Wed hir to wife, and Crowne hir to my Quene Into this case lat ?our wisdomes be sene. Sa thay depart than fra the Empreour Deuisit thair Lordis of wisdome and valour, To seik this Quene throw mony lands yai past Quhill thay come to ane countrie at the last Callit Cecyll, quhilk had ane Nobill King, Quhilk Royallie into his Realme did Ring, With greit puissance, riches and honour, Quha had ane Mayd of all fairnes the flour To his douchter of fourtene ?eir of age Nobill, courtes, and plesand of visage. With all vertew that in wemen micht be, And wise at will siclike appeirandlie. Quhome thay desirit at this gude Nobill King In Mariage to the Empreour bring, And mak hir Quene of all the haill Impire This Nobill King grantit to thair desire. The Lordis of Counsall and Ambassadouris War than depeschit with plesure &amp; honouris, And brocht with thame this Nobill gay Ladie Quhilk yair ?o?g Quene &amp; als Emprice suld be Thay heisit vp sails with all thair clene curage With manlie micht come fordwart yair veyage Vpon the sey thay sufferit greit perrell In hame cumming, be sair storme and trauell Walter?d with wind out throw y? mudy wawis The boriall blastis sa bauldlie on thame blawis That thay war fane and Ioyfull at the last To saue thair lyfis, for to cut thair mane Mast. Cut thair Cabillis, and ouir burd cast thair geir All of thair lifis thay stude into sic feir. Sum of thame said, it was ane schrewit Sing Of ane gude luck sic ane Quene hame to bring, Quhairthrow thay war all in point for to tine, And wist not quhat wald be the latter fine. Sum said agane all was cum for the best, Scho was wyteles, howbeit storme thame opprest. Sa ilk ane said as yai yat time bethocht Sa at dew time to thair awin coist was brocht Als sone thay come vnto thair kyndlie coist, Doun drew thair saills, and thair gude schippis loist Than word beliue come to the Empreour That all his Lordis was landit with plesour, And with them brocht ane Nobill ?oung Ladie Quhilk to the King his weddit wyfe suld be. The empreour causit proclame throw Romes to? That euerie Lord, Knichte Marques &amp; Barro? In best array to mak thame all reddy With fair fassoun to meit that ?oung Lady, Quhilk but delay was done with diligence, And sa thay gaue this Lady all presence: In riche array, as thay culd best deuise, With all triumph, and into thair best wise To the Cietie thay did hir all conuoy, With all glaidnes, mirth, melodie and Ioy. And quhen scho come vnto this Nobill toun, The Bellis rang with honour and Renoun. The claithis of gold was spred throw all y? streit Quhen scho lichtit, to gang vpon hir feit. The riche Badkins, the coistlie veluot wobbis The browdin warkis, &amp; the riche Ryall robbis Quhilk on the stairis war spred sa heich on hie It was plesure for ony man to se. With all vther warldis vane fantasise, That mannis braine and Ingyne culd deuise. And sa at last come in the Empreour With his greit Lordis of riches and honour. Gaue this Lady his persoun in presence, With all triumph, Renoun and reuerence: And hir Imbraist as culd him best effeir, And said Lady ?e ar richt welcum heir Than the greit Ioy that in that Cietie was My waik Ingyne can na way weill compas Sa on the morne quhen that the day was licht Vnto the Kirk thay led this Lady bricht, With all triumphe, greit mirth and melodie With mennis wit that culd deuisit be. Conuoyit with Kingis nobill Princes &amp; Lords As at sic time aggreis weill and accords. Sine followit hir the Nobill Empreour With all his Lords, that was of greit valour.

Makand thair mirth all into gude ordour, Heraldis of Armes into thair coit Armour: Past on befoir as it was maist semelie In thair awin stait, conforme to thair degre. Quhill thay come to the Royall Kirk of Rome Quhilk was the heid of Kirkis in christindome Thair lichtit thay with mirth and merynes For to compleit the band of halynes: That GOD deuysit betuix woman and man Quhen he this warld first creat and began. Of that Cietie the greit Bischop was thair, With all his Clerkis of greit wisdome and lair This band being compleit in Goddis Name With mirth and Ioy to the Palice past hame, Quhair thair was maid banket with melodie, With alkin mirth and plesant menstralie. Quhill that nicht come, than Ilk man thocht it best To quyet pas and tak the nichtis rest. Sa this Lady but ony tarying Scho past to bed with hir housband the King And sa obtenit the greit fauour and lufe Of hir gude Lord, that it culd not remufe. And of hir lufe he tuke sa greit delite, That vther Quene he had for?et hir quite: And all his lufe was cast on this new Quene As he befoir had neuer Maryit bene.

Quod he that thing deuyse how that ?e can, For that exceidis the wit of ony man For to get barnis, sen God will not thame grant Than force it is baith ?e and I thame want. Scho said my Lord it is vnto me schawin, Ze haue ane Sone quhilk is not to me knawin With seuin Maisters, maist wysest on the gro?d And he him self, nane wyser can be found. Wald ?e bring him to Court in my presence I suld do all deuoir and diligence, Him to Intreit into sa gude fassoun, That all suld say out throw greit Romes toun Not onlie said, but also suld be sworne, That he war of my awin twa sydis borne. And sen sa is, That I can nocht consaue, Onlie ?our Sone, as my awin I wald haue My Lord this is the asking I require, Beseiking ?ow to fulfill my desire. Zit not the les hir minde was and hir thocht In sutteltie, and all with malice wrocht. Imagining daylie the Chyldis deid Thocht his Father tuke not sic thing in heid, He said Lady that will I not deny Quhat euer ?e ask, enamorit sa am I Into ?our lufe, that force compellis me Quhat ?e will ask, denyit it sall not be. Thairfoir sen I the secretis of my hart Schawis to ?ow plaine, to me keip ?e ?our part As for my Sone it is lang time by past And diuers ?eiris sen that I saw him last.

For I beleue he hes bene diligent In his studie, and in science frequent. And for to leir, wit, knawledge and wisdome That efter me for to gyde this kingdome. Scho said my Lord, that it be sa God grant, For that same caus I wald na way him want. Bot gif scho said thir wordis with hir hart Ze will persaue be proces efterwart. The Empreour sone gart mak ane missiue, The Messinger he was direct beliue: Into greit haist with expeditioun, Vnto the seuin greit Maisteris of Renoun. Incontinent vnder the pane of deid, And na les pane nor wanting of thair heid: Suld bring his Sone to him at Witsonday, All excuses being clene put away.

Vnkyndlie Captanes ouirthrawis And commoun welth doun drawis And leidis not the auld Lawis Bot contrair wirks plane. This was the maist motiue, the caus and the querrell, That causit thir Princes compeir, to schaw all the perrell The greit danger and dout, and the caus haill Baith for commoun welth and Croune, gif airs chancit faill Thair was bot onlie ane Thairfoir this mater thay mene To caus him tak ane new Quene That new Airs micht be sene, Gif this Air war gane. And sa belyue but pley to counsall be applyit Caus it was the commoun weill he durst not deny it Bot zit his first Quenes desyre, in sum part past by it That to the court the chyld brocht, quhair he was sair inuyit The Empreour not knew Ze ken of auld this trew Tale Nyce is the Nychtingale The Empreour gaue hir credence hale And neuer word trew. Quhen wemen speikis fairest thay ar maist fals found, Thay gar sweit licour swym aboue, and gall is at the ground Thay shaw thame lyke ane turtill dow, and bytis as ane hound The Empreour was dessauit sair, as sone was efter found Thay war ay and salbe Sa quesitiue baith nicht and day The Empreour culd na gait say nay Bot men suld not trow that thay say Sa oft becaus thay lie. How the seuin Maisteris efter the sicht of the Empreouris Letteris wald first se the cours of the Firmament and Planetis, quhidder it was gude to obey his c?mandement or not. Als sone as yir seuin maisters had ouirsene The Empreours writ, &amp; vnderstude it clene On the nixt nicht, all seuin with ane consent Past to espy the sternis and Firmament To tak Iornay gif it was prosperous Or contrair way, gif it was dangerous. For to fulfill the Empreouris command, Or gif thay durst the samin to ganestand. Anone thay spy into the Firmament Ane stormie sterne that troublit thair Intent. Persauing weill be the sterne gif that thay Thair Iornay tuke, and raid that samin day To thame affixt, be the Empreouris command The Childe but dout in greit perrell suld stand, For the first word that he spak in presence Of his Father in oppin audience, Suld be the caus of his greit schamefull deid This to eschew thay culd find na remeid. Quhairof thay war all sad and wounder sorie And wist not weill to trauell or to tarie, Ane vther sterne than thay beheld also, Schawing to thame to the King wald not go And keip the day, quhilk was affixt thame to, To w?t thair heids, thair was nocht ellis ado Ane of them said quhair twa Illis dois appeir Lat vs that tak quhairin lyis leist dangeir. It is better surelie I say for me For this Impire that we all seuin suld die, And vther seuin siclike as we ar all Or this ?oung man suld suffer ony thrall. Thairfoir lat vs all seuin with ane Intent, Our awin personis to the Empreour present, And let the Chylde at hame alone remane To se giue we, tary or cummis agane. And sa thay war all seuin richt sorrowfow, Pansing alwayis, quhat meane fassoun or how Thay micht eschew this Inconuenient. Sa this ?oung man come doun Incontinent, Fra his Chalmer, quhair he was studiand, His seuin Maisteris all sittand thair he fand. Richt sorrowfull, and sad in countenance, He them Inquyrit, quhat was the caus &amp; ch?ce Of their sadnes, thay said this standis the cace, We all beleuit till had of ?ow solace, Blyithnes and Ioy, and also gude rewaird, But now Fortoun has bene to ?ow sa hard, That all sic thing to greit wanhap will turne, Quhairfoir we all hes greit caus for to murne, For all our Ioy, and our Felicitie Is like to turne to greit aduersitie. He said Maisters I pray ?ow to me schaw How the case standis, ?it ?e will lat me knaw. Thay said the case that we can schaw to ?ow Into the self is wonder sorrowfow, For ?our Father the Empreour and King Vnto vs seuin hes send ane schairp wryting, Commanding vs withouttin tarying On pane of lyfis that we ?ow till him bring, Incontinent at the nixt Penthecoist, Thir his wrytingis he hes send at the poist, To quhat effect, we knaw not his Intent, Bot we all seuin hes spyit the Firmament, The Planetis eik and als the sternis cleir, And we can se na vther thing appeir Bot haistelie without ony remeid, And ?e speak anis ?e sall thoill suddand deid. Gif we delay, and bring ?ow not him till, Our deid is dicht, and in ?our Fatheris will. The Childe answerit agane richt humblie I sair repent that sic ane thing suld be. Can ?e not find in that case na remeid Bot outher I, or ?e to suffer deid? Zit I mon pas and all the sternes spy Gif I can find ony remeid thairby That may put of that deidlie dolent hour, And satisfie my Father the Empreour. Incontinent he veseis ouir his buikis, Sine efter that vnto the sternes he luikis. Amang the rest ane proper sterne he saw, That was richt cleir perfite and wonder smaw Quhairby richt weill considderit he the cace, Giue that he culd abstene seuin dayis space Fra all speiking and hald him self as dum Ouir sic perrell he clenelie suld ouircum. And all thair lifis in na perrell to be, Quhilk sterne he leit all his seuin Maisters se. And said Maisters behald and weill persaue, Giue I my self as dum man moste me haue. Seuin dayis but speiche, sine on the auchtand day All the perrell I sall auoyde away. And ?e ar seuin of all the warld maist wise, I think it is bot ane small Interprise, Ilk ane of ?ow to saue my life ane day, Quhen that is done, Than sum thing I sall say, That ?e and I fra all perrell salbe The Maisteris seuin concludit perfitelie. All that he said was wonder Iust and trew, For be the sterne the samin weill thay knew, And randerit thankis to Potestatis diuine, That thair Scoller had sa perfite Ingine, Of cleir cunning, sic ane sterne to considder Quhairby that thay suld all be saif togidder: And out of dout, and all danger of deid, Seuin dayis put by, him self to find remeid.

The seuin Maisters perfytelie sa knawand The Empreour, with his Court was c?mand. Vnto the Childe all in ane voce thay said, We think it best sum danger to auoid, That we all seuin pas into the Citie, And ?e fordward pas with ?our companie. In the meane time, that we may all prouyde Sum help, that may put by this towter tide, And we sall do all that we can or may For ?our supplie, Ilk ane to keip ane day. The Childe answerit as ?e will plesis me, Remember ?it on my necessitie. In greit danger I wait that I will stand. Thairfoir think on quhat ?e haue tane on h?d. Thay tuke thair leif at him sorrowfullie. Sine all thay raid toward Romes Citie. Sa fordwart come Dioclesiane rydand, And lukis on far saw his Father cumand, And as thay met, of his hors lichtit doun, To his Father he maid him reddy boun, Kneland on kne with all obedience, Sine his Father with lufe and reuerence, About his neck oft times he tuke and kist, That he was dum his Father ?it not wist.

Sa hame thay come, out throw the greit Cietie Of Romes toun, with greit Solemnitie. Quhill thay come to the Empreours Palice Quhair that thair was mony antick deuise. And of thair hors beliue thay lichtit doun With greit triumph honour and als Renoun, The Father led his Sone in be the hand Into the hall, quhair mony was bydand, And set him doun besyde him at the deis, The Heralds had sone silence all and ceis. Than Sone he said, now ?e will speik to me Zour seuin Maisters, how do thay tell lat se? How dois ?our self, for it is lang ago Sen I ?ow saw, the suith it is euin so.

Quhairat his Father meruellit gretumlie And in ane part he lukit ernestlie, And said tell me, withoutin mony sawis That ?e speak not, the maner and the caus. He answerit not, bot bowit doun his heid, The Empreour saw that than was na remeid, He pansit in minde, of his Sone not content, Sa the Emprice gat word Incontinent, Quhairof scho was wonder Ioyous and glaid To hir Ladyis with merie minde scho said, Now will I go Dioclesiane to se, Quhairfoir that ?e my best clething bring me. And sa anone scho went doun to the haw Quhair that beliue Dioclesiane scho saw Vpon the deis besyde the Childe sat doun Is this ?our sone my Lord suld bruik ?our cro??

Sa did this Chylde quhen that he saw His Father be the way cummand Doun of his hors he lichtit law On his kneis tuke him be the hand, Als quhen his Father gaue command Him for to speik, he bowit his heid Sith humbill hart to him menand I dar not speik for feir of deid. Sic thing his Father na way kend Bot quhen the Quene come in presence Incontinent he bad him wend With hir to Chalmer, and go hence The Chyld with all Obedience Past at command howbeit he knew That it wald caus ane greit Offence, Kend weill that race that he wald rew.

How the Emprice led Dioclesiane to hir Chalmer for to mak merines, quhilk appeirandlie he withstude. The Emprice than s?

Than the Emprice tuke Dioclesiane Be the richt hand, and to Chalmer is gane, And causit auoide all the Chalmers anone, Nane baid thairin bot thay twa thame alone. Scho thocht not best nane vther thair suld byde And set him doun befoir hir awin bed syde: And said to him thir wordis in ane part O best belouit Dioclesiane my hart: Oft times I haue hard speik of ?our bewtie, Zour wit, wisdome, and ?our greit courtasie, Zour greit vertew or euer I ?ow saw, I couet ?ow muche baith to se and knaw, I am richt blyith my sweit Dioclesiane, That we tua now ar sa secreit alane. I wald haue giuen within this ?eir ago Ten thousand pound for to haue had it so. And I am glaid that now I may behald The samin thing that my hart alwayis wald. And I haue causit ?our Father for ?ow send To that Intent, and for that fynall end, That I may haue of ?our bodie solace, And now sen we ar heir in secreit place, For without fault I say to ?ow planelie I haue keipit my clene virginitie To ?ow trewlie, vnto this present hour Notwithstanding ?our Father the Empreour Hes maryit me, ?it I wald not consent In that behalf to fulfill his Intent: Bot at all times hes waitit vpon ?ow, Quhairfoir of me ?e tak ?our plesure now: And speik to me, and lat vs go to bed, Sen I my self now thairto hes ?ow led. Quhat euer scho said, quhateuer scho did or wrocht For al hir talk ane word he answerit nocht Scho seing that, to him scho said agane, O my sweit hart, and gude Dioclesiane, I sweir ?ow heir, be Pater and be Paull, In ?our keping ?e haue my lyfe and Saull. Quhat is the caus to me ?e will not speik? Schaw me of lufe sum takin I beseik. For as ye knaw I am ane ?oung Lady, And to performe ?our will am heir reddy. Sa in hir armes diuers times scho hynt, Him to haue kist, to his mouth maid ane mynt, He turnit his heid, and wald not thole hir kis In hir awin minde (quod scho) quhat thing is this That to this man profferis my bodie, And be na way he will consent to me, Dioclesiane my onlie lufe scho said Sen that my lufe sa firme is on ?ow laid: Quhy do ?e this, to be to me vnkynde, Knawing richt weill ?e haue my hart &amp; mynde And thair is nane that may persaue or se, Quhat that is done into this hous bot we. Thairfoir grant me the thing that I ?ow craif, And ?e thairfoir my Madinheid to haif, He wryit his face away and his visage. For be na way he lykit hir langage. Persauing than that scho culd not obtene His lufe nor fauour, bot it denyit clene.

That he skarslie may stand vpon his feit, Quhairfoir to me, nor sic he is not meit. At ?our plesure thairfoir my body tak, He seing this, his heid he turnit bak, That be na signe, nor vther countenance Into na sort he wald do hir plesance. Bot in sa far as he culd him remufe, Scho micht persaue that scho wantit his lufe. Quod scho agane, gif it plesis ?ow nocht To speik to me, nor ?it schaw me ?our thocht.

How the Emprice complenit to the Empreour of the shame done to hir be his Sone Dioclesiane.

For gude causis to Chalmer I him led, Sine like ane knaif he wald defoulit my bed I chereist him with wordis of greit comfort, To speik to me, I bid him oft exhort. On foull badrie his minde was onlie set, Fra time he saw his willis he culd not get At his plesure, he maid him me deforce Contrair my will, and sa hes rent my Corce, With effusioun of blude all aboundant, And beleuing na vther thing Instant Bot haistie deid, war not I gaue ane schout.

Quhen that the King this mater hard and saw He was Inflambit with cruell Ire and gaw, Malice, wodnes, and greit Melancholie, Was na remeid, bot that his Sone suld die. Callit Sergandis &amp; gaue thame strait c?mand On ane Gallous thay suld him hang fra hand Th? said the Lords y? stude the Empreour neir, And pleis ?our grace sum of our wordis to heir.

Bot not the les with sa haistie Intent, We think not best we say with ane consent Zour onlie Sone that ?e sa sone put doun Without ordour of Law or prouisioun The Law is maid to punische trespassouris All geuin to euill and mischant transgressouris And gif sa be that he be found the same Than be ordour lat the Law him condame: That na man say that the greit Empreour His onlie Sone in wodnes and furour Without the Law hes put his Sone to deid, Pleis ?our greit grace to this mater tak heid. The Empreour to sic wordis gaue audience, And said my Lordis, of me ?e haue credence Within this Realme to leid Iustice and Law, Thairfoir I will consent weill to ?our saw. And als I think it richt expedient He be condampnit in ane plane Iudgement. Than command was to put him in presoun, Thair to remane without ony ransoun, Vnto the time that Iustice Court suld stand Than four Iewellours ressauit him fra hand, In deip presoun richt schairplie him Inclusit, Quhairin befoir the Childe was neuer vsit. Now lat him sit, God couer him of cair, Of the Emprice lat vs speik farthermair. Quha perseueirit in malice and greit Ire Aganis this Childe, as ony byrnand fyre.

Quh? nicht was cum, ye King to Chalmer past And fand his Quene weiping &amp; murning fast Wringing hir hands, sobbing and siching sair, The King was noyit to se hir mak sic cair. To quhome he said, O my deir Lady gent, Quhat is the caus that ?e sa sair lament? Scho said my Lord, knaw ?e not all the cace, How ?our curst Sone hes maid bludie my face. And wald me put to vtter displesour War not ?our self, and vthers maid succour. Ze commandit, him for to hang fra hand, Zit not the les, on life he is leifand. Nor ?our command is not obeyit at all, Nor ?it my schame na way is maid to fall. Quhairfoir my Lord, I think that ?e stand aw Vpon ?our Sone, to leid Iustice and law. Than to the Quene the Empreour can say, Madame sa sone, the morne as it is day All ?our desire to fulfill and Intent, He sall but dout thole Iustice in Iudgement. Quod scho my Lord, sall he ?it leif sa lang. Quod he Madame, lat this ane nicht ouirgang Than micht sic chance on ?ow cum haistelie As on ane Burges come of this Cietie.

In na point be partiall, ?our Ballance beir equall Than do ?e God ane greit plesour And to ?our self purches honour, and wynnis gude word of all. To knaw quhat the Empreour, the Emprice, the zoung Chylde, and the seuin Doctouris signifyis. Or we proceid ?it farthermair, Of this mater sum thing will schaw Quhat ilk thing menis for to declair The mater better ?e will knaw This Empreour that leidis the Law He signifyis a mannis persoun That walteris betuix wynde and waw Into this warld ay vp and doun. His Sone betakins the Saull of man Quhilk in the corps is ay Inclusit, The Emprice Signifyis Sathan, Quhilk euer oppin malice musit. The seuin Doctouris a seuin vertewis Fechtand contrair seuin deidlie sinnis, Quhilk that the sillie Saull persewis Fra to distructioun it beginnis. The seuin dayis this Childe is dum Of mannis lyfe thay ar the space, For in this warld fra he first cum He neuer hes perfyte solace, Quhill that God tak him in his grace, And for?et all this warldlie lust, Than speikis he to God face to face Quhen that the Deuill he hes vincust. Euin sa of this Emprice Tale, Tauld for to tempt the Empreour Trowand perfytelie to preuaill And of this Childe to be victour Tellis on hir Tale for his plesour Of quhilk the Empreour was content As ?e sall heir gude Auditour Thairfoir to purpois lat vs went. The first Tale of the Emprice is of the gude tre that grew in the Burges Gardine, and for the Imp that grew besyde it he gart cut the greit tre. In Romes Toun remanit ane riche Burges Quhilk had at welth all mirth and merines With fair biggings, quhilk was baith braid &amp; hie With gay gardings, yat was plesand to se Of alkin flouris he had thairin ane part That was to get about in euerie art. To tell thair Names I neid not now tak tome Few was siclyke, sa plesand in all Rome. In this Gardine thair grew ane Nobill trie Quhilk euerie ?eir brocht furth frute gude pl?tie Sine by all this the frute that on it grew Was sa done sweit, and of sa greit vertew. Quhat man that had ony sair Maladie, As is Liper, Exces or Popplecie. Sa sone as he of this frute gat ane taist, Of all seiknes he wald be haill in haist. And sa it chancit vpon ane haly day, This Burges went in his Garding to say His Orisouns, and behalding this trie Ane gay ?oung Imp behynd it quyetlie He saw growand, quhilk was proper and fair, Incontinent he callit the Gairdnair. He said gude freind se ?e be wonder sure, And of this Imp daylie that ?e tak cure, For I beleue to haue ane better tre Of that ?oung plant, and better be sic thre Nor is the auld, quhilk I can not auance That pith Inlaikis, sap, sapour and substance. Howbeit this tre be far growin it abone, The Gairdnar said, Maister it sall be done. Within [thir] few dayis to schaw the for certane To se this plant the Burges come agane, Quhilk as he thocht, was not half sa plesand As it was quhen, the first day he it fand. To the Gairdnar he said how can this be My tender plant, appeiris not to me Half sa plesand, as it was the last day. He said Maister, now tak tent quhat I say Na wonder is, this auld tre is far mair And fra the ?oung takis all substance and air. Be the ressoun the branches ar so braid, Sa the ?oung plant is sa vnliklie maid. For gif this plant gat the substance and air That this tre gettis, belyue it wald grow mair, Nor is the auld, for eild almaist is deid. The Burges said thairof I wait remeid, Cut doun the bewis and branches of the auld. Quod he Maister, I sall do as ?e haue tauld. And sa he did, syne efter in schort space To se the plant, agane come the Burges, And saw richt weill, that the same tender plant Sum neidfull thing it did Inlaik and want. To the Gairdnar he said how chancis this My tender plant it dois misthriue I wis. Schaw me the caus thairof without lesing, He said Maister, I suppois of ane thing, That is the hicht of this greit growand tre Haldis away the Sone as thinkis me. Quhilk geuis life, and nurisching but dout To alkin thing that euer grew thairout. And als the rane it may not cum it neir Quhilk nurischis also sum time of ?eir. Thir twa wanting, thair is na tre can thriue The Burges said, that sall we mend beliue. Cut the auld clene, and quite doun be the rute, For I suppone we sall get better frute, Of this ?oung tre, nor of the auld was had. The Gairdnar did as his Maister him bad, Cuttit the auld, and leit the ?oung tre stand still, Sa he obeyit his Maisters minde and will. Efter schort time as this was done and wrocht, Baith auld and ?o?g perischt and come to nocht Quhairof greit harme and dule come to the pure For quha was seik, of thair helth thay war sure Hauand recours vnto that Nobill trie Quhilk to cut doun, it was ane greit pietie. And quhen the pure persauit it was cut doun, Thay curst waryit, with mony malesoun. That ony way thairto gaue thair counsell, Or helpit thairto, thay quite condampnit to hell For quhy the pure of all Infirmiteis War ay weill curit of all thair Maladeis. Quod scho my Lord now haue ?e vnderstand Quhat I haue said, quod he that I warrand. Quod scho the Mairch heirof I sall declair The quhilk pertenis to ?our vnsonsie Air. The declaratioun of this Tale tauld be the Emprice. This auld tre is ?our awin Nobill persoun. That with counsall of ?our Lordis of reno? The pure and seik dois ay help and supplie Be ?our Iustice and greit Nobilitie. This ?oung plant is, ?our awin vnthriftie Air, Zow to distroy, he castis him euer mair Be his cunning growand vp gre be gre. As did the Imp behind the mekle tre. And for to caus to cut the branches doun Quhilkis ar ?our Lordis nixt ?our awin perso? That he may ring and sit into ?our chyre, This is his mynd that he dois maist desyre, Of this mater than quhat sall efter fall All the folk sall murne, weip, schout and als call And wary thame that cuttit doun the tre, Quhair that thay wont to get help and supplie Or gaue co?sall this ?oung Imp for to nurische Bot it distroy, or it bure frute or flurische. My counsall is thairfoir the Imp cut doun, Sen ?it ?our self ringis in ?our hie renoun. And suffer not the ?oung Imp for to grow, For he sall do daylie that euer he dow Zow to distroy, and ?our body put doun, And purches not the Maledictioun Of the pure folk, quhome to ?e war saifgaird, Thairfoir in haist tak ?our sone furth of waird And but delay, on Gallous gar him hing, Ze doing this, ?e do lyke ane wise King. The Empreour said, Madame now be the rude Zour counsall is, baith hailsum, wise and gude The morne he sall go to the deid maist vylde, Howbeit he be my onlie gottin Chylde. The morne become, he callit his Lordis all Togidder past vnto the Iustice hall The Empreour him self sat in Iudgement. On pannall put his Sone Incontinent. And sa at schort he was condampnit to deid, To be hangit, on Gallous but remeid. With mortall sound than passand him beforne Of trumpet, schawme, &amp; als of blawing horne. As the vse was quhen ony man suld die, Suld be conuoyit with siclyke menstralie. And as he past doun throw the greit Cietie, The pepill murnit, sayand it was pietie, The onlie Sone of the Empreour to hang Mony murnit, mony thair hands wrang. In meane sesoun as he past doun the streit, His first Maister Pantillas culd him meit. The Maister saw he was to Gallous led, With speid of Spurris, to the Palice him sped. To quhome the Childe sa sone as he him saw, Doun with his heid than he Inclynit law. As he wald said, Maister gif ?e be kinde, Now in my neid, I pray haue of me minde. For I am now, without ?e get mercie Condampnit heir, on Gallous for to die. Ze may weill wit than he na tary maid, Bot in all haist vnto the Palice raid, Zit not the les vnto the Ministeris, Prouestis, Sergands, Iewillours and Officers He maid requeist, that thay suld haist nathing, For he beleuit to get grace fra the King. To saue his lyfe, he sall not die this day, Than war thay glaid, to ?ow the suith I say. All in ane voce the pepill bad him haist, Sa without baid he raid as he war chaist. At the Palice he lichtit of his hors, Quha suld him dicht, he tuke bot lytill force. Of the Empreour belyue he gat presence, To quhome he gaue on kneis greit reuerence, As him effeirit, to quhome the Empreour said War not I will ?our reuerence not degraid, Ze and the rest richt sair suld puneist be, For ?our rewaird, ?e serue na mair of me. He said my Lord and pleis ?our Nobill grace Th? I haue spent richt Ill my seuin ?eiris space Taking laubouris on ?our sone day and nicht, In gude doctrine him teichand as I micht. Zit our laubouris at all we nocht regaird, Bot beleuit weill to get better rewaird. The empreour said, thow leis Doctour but dout First vnto the, sine to the rest about, My onlie Sone weill speikand haill and feir I delyuerit, now ?e haue brocht him heir With na maners, bot doytit, daft and dum, And mair attour to schaw the all and sum Thocht he be dum, sic thing mon cum on chance Be Goddis will or his gude Ordinance. Bot by all this, he purposit quhilk was wors My awin Lady, on maistres to defors. And all hir face with hir riche Ornament, In greit malice he hes all reuin and rent. Thairfoir this day he sall not faill to die, And efter him thow and thy companie. The Maister said, with wordis mylde and meik As for ?our Sone ?e say that can not speik. The Lord of all that mater weill he knawis, As ?e sall knaw he is not dum but caus. I traist in God the suith ?ow for to say, Ane thousand him sall heir speik on ane day. As for ?our wyfe, my Lord quhair ?e allege Quhair that he wald, haue done to hir outrage On treuth my Lord I sall schaw ?ow but weir In companie with vs this mony ?eir, As is weill kend, continuallie hes bene Sic thing of him was neuer hard nor sene. Thairfoir gude Lord for ?our greit reuerence To sic voyde sawis gif not ouir sone credence, For giue ?e caus ?our onlie Sone to die For the fals wordis of ?our wyfis vanitie. On chance it sall far wors to happin ?ow, Nor to ane Knicht, quhairof I sall tell now, That for the wordis of his vane wantoun wife, Gart him bereif his gay Grewhound the life, Quhilk sauit his sone fra slauchter of the serp?t. Than said the King tell me furth that Legent. Pantillas said than to his Souerane Gif I sa did, than war my Tale in vane. For or my Tale war all compleit but dout, Of ?our ane Sone the life may be put out. And than my Tale for nathing it war tald, Bot gif ?our grace of ?our greit mercie wald Reteir ?our Sone fra the Gallous agane, Than I wald think my Tale war not in vane. Thairfoir gif that ?our Grace plesis to heir, Ze caus ?our Sone quhill the morne reteir. That being done, than on the morne ?e may Do ?our Intent quhen it is fair licht day. The Empreour than schortlie to conclude, With heuie minde this talk weill vnderstude, And causit the Childe for to be callit agane Vnto the morne in presoun to remane. Than this Doctour richt plesandlie began To tell his Tale but aw of ony man. Moralitas. I can not say, bot nay, of this Burges For till assay, alway, for gredynes To cut his tre, wald be, of sic riches, I say for me, that he preuit fulischnes And als was not witles, baith tre and frute he wantit The gardner not saikles, to cut sa sone that grantit. It was euill done, sa sone, to cut it doun Thocht it abone, conione, wald not weill soun With the ?oung tre, to be, at diuisioun I say for me, surelie, was na ressoun I hard sic a lessoun, better to haue in hand A bird in possessioun, nor twa in wod fleand. Ane Dog I reid, in deid, ane Collap staw Passand throw Tweid, with speid, the schadow saw That it was mair, larger, the flesche leit faw Of it was clair, euin thair, of flesche and aw Thay vse in hous and haw, quhat euer denner coist Lat beif not fra ?ow draw, quhill that ?e get ?our roist. Gif this Burges, sic case, had weill foirsene Sic gredynes, doutles, than had not bene That nobill tre, sa fre, sa fresche and grene Sa sone to be, schortlie, doun cuttit clene Greit couatice I mene, of this was all the caus. As hes bene red and sene, into auld doctouris sawis. Cupidites est radix omnium malorum. Timot. vj. Ane reproche or reprufe to the Emprice. Now thow thy tale hes tauld, with thy fals fyrie lippis Bot not gottin thow wald, licht skirt for all thy skippis Had I the in my grippis, on the I suld be wrokin The heit into thy hippis, the salt sey will not slokin. Thow art ane baird full brokin, ane hiddeous helles hyrd, Better thow had not spokin, condampnit Deuillis byrd. The Tale of Pantillas the first Doctour. Into ane Realme thair wynnit ane vail?e?t knicht Of nobill fame, of greit riches &amp; micht That had ane sone, my Lord now as ?e haue To thre Nuresis to foster he him gaue, The first Nureis to giue him suck and feid, The nixt him wesche, &amp; keip him clene at neid. The thrid to bring him vnto sleip and rest, The Nobill Knicht for his barne thocht it best. This Knicht also he had ane gay Grewhound That nane mair swyft, did rin upon the gro?d Also he had ane Falcon fair of flicht, Richt swyft of wing quhen scho likit to licht. Thir twa the Knicht lufit abone measure, Becaus oft times they did him greit pleasure. This Grewhound was sa swift and of sic speid Quhen he was lousit, his pray he gart ay bleid And the same pray brocht to his Lord anone, This was ane caus he lufit him allone. Also quhen that this Knicht past to battell, Gif that his chance that time wald not preuaill Into his mouth his hors taill wald he tak, About his luggis, oft times he wald it schaik. Syne ?oull and cry, as he wald quyte rin wode Sa be that Signe, the Knicht weill vnderstude Gif at that time he wald furder or no, And sa oft times leit him to battell go. His halk also was sa feirce in hir flicht, Sa swyft of wing, and als sa wonder wicht That scho was neuer cast of till assay, Bot without fault scho brukit ay hir pray. Thir war causis this Hound and Halk he lufit, Becaus to myrth thay rasit him oft and mufit. Also this Knicht kest all his haill Intent In hors rinning, Iusting and Tornament. Sa on ane day he causit to proclame At his Castell, to set fordwart his Name Quha wald cum thair to Tornay or Iusting, Breiking of speiris, and als of hors rynning, At the set day, to be matchit suld not faill, This was the cry, and sa to schort my Taill, The Knicht him self first enterit in the feild To the tornay, with harnes hors and scheild. Sine efter him past his fair Lady gent With hir Ladyis, to se the Tornament. Sine efter that, past all the Nuresis thre The Tornament for to behald and se. Lokking the dures, leuing the barne alone, Traisting Ischie nor entrie suld be none: Quhill the Tornay, and Iusting suld be done Than in all haist, thay suld returne richt sone, Beleuand weill the barne not to awalk, Nane being thair, bot the Hound and the Halk, And the ?oung Chylde, that in the Creddill lay Except thir thre, the rest all past away. That na man knew, lay lurking in the haw Ane greit Serpent, befoir na man did knaw. Quhen scho persauit the hous sa desolait, And nane thairin that durst with hir debait. Out of hir hole sone scho put furth hir heid At this Infant hauand ane cruell feid. Quha lay sleiping in the Creddill alone, Him to deuoir, at schort sa is scho gone. The Falcon this behalding quhair scho sat, Vpon her Perk, to do scho wist not quhat, Bot with hir wingis, scho russillit &amp; rang hir bellis Almaist scho had al schakin yame in schellis Sa with the noyis &amp; beir quhilk maid the Halk This gud hound rais, and of his sleip did walk And quhen he saw that the Serpent did creip Towart the Creddill, quhair that the barne did sleip With ane fell faird on the Serpent he ran And sa at schort thir twa to fecht began, Sa cruellie, that it was greit meruaill Quhilk of the twa at that time suld preuaill. Ane to deuoir, the vther to defend Thir twa at lenth togidder did contend. Sa lang at lenth thir twa togidder faucht, Amaist the ho?d al quyte had loist his maucht, Sa cruellie he was woundit in blude, That all about quhair that the Creddill stude, Was blude berun, that meruell was to se, Betuix sic twa sa bauld bargane to be. The Grewhound than persauing his awin blude Into his hart wor sa cruell and wode, With ane fell faird vpon the Serpent ran. Sa thame betuix ane new bargane began. With sic malice, melancolie and Ire, Quhil ane was deid, yat nane of yame wald tire Nor leif the feild, quhill it chancit at the last, Betuix thame twa, the Creddill ouir thay cast. With boddum vp, and on the Toris it stude, Quhair it was all about berun with blude. Sa it become, and fell be Goddis grace That the four Toris sauit the Childis face. And sleipit still with visage toward the ground Thir twa fechtand, the Serpent and the hound Quhill at the last the hound into certane, This fell Serpent he hes ouircum and slane. And sauit the Childe fra perrell in that tide, Quhen all was done, doun be the Creddill side, Licking his woundis lay doun this nobil ho?d For fechting sair, and sa on sleip fell sound. Besyde this Bab, quhilk in the Creddill lay, Nane in the hous, bot onlie thir same tway. The Bab sleiping, and wist na kind of Ill, The hound werie, and fochin furth his fill. The Serpent slane, as I said ?ow befoir, The Babie saif, and the hound woundit soir. And so anone efter this tornament Ilk man woman vnto thair ludgeing went. To tell that day quha wan the Interpryse, That erand now to my mater not lyis. Thairfoir as now that thing I wil lat be, And lat vs speik of the Nuresis thre. Quha first come hame and enterit in the haw, Sa sone as thay the blude and creddill saw. Wringing thair handis and ryfing doun thair hair Crying allace wo on vs euer mair. Our onlie Childe our Bab and fosterbarne Is quyte deuoirit, with ane Dog and forfarne. Allace for wo, allace quhat sall we do, We ken na place for succour to rin to. Giue our Maister perchance vs apprehend, Thair is nane may fra his handis vs defend. Bot alway sall on vs cum suddand deid, We knaw na way quhair we may find remeid, Sen sa is cum lat vs in haist all thre To saue our life, but baid away to fle. Euin sa thay did, and left the hous alone, But mair counsall all thre away is gone. And had na wit nor wisdome in thair heid To se quhidder the barne was quick or deid, Nor lift the Creddill, and to persaue the cace, Bot ran away all thre crying allace. And as thay war sa passand furth the streit, Thair awin Maistres thay chancit for to meit With hir Ladyis cumming fra the Tornay, Scho persauing hir Nuresis in the way, Richt sair murning, and ryfing doun thair hair All wo begane, repleit of sturt and cair. Sone scho Inquirit at yame how stude the cace Thay answerit hir a thousand times allace. Quhat sall we say for wordis to multiplie Thair is na bute all man the case may se. Ane Deuill Madame into ane Doggis skin Hes slane ?our Sone, alone ?our hall within. To the quhilk Dog my Lord gaue maist delite, Bot now he hes of ?our Sone maid ?ow quite. In takin ?it quhair that the Creddill stude, The Dog sleipis still new bathit in his blude. He was the Dog that my Lord lufit best, He was na Dog, bot with ane Deuill possest, Thairfoir Lady, for vs is na remeid, Bot outher fle, or ells to bide the deid. Thairfoir Madame of vs ?e haue mercie, This is the caus that causis vs to fle. This scho heiring, anone fell to the ground, Without mair space into ane deidlie sound. And ?it at last Ladyis gart hir awalk, Held vp hir heid, quhill scho began to talk, And said allace, my deir Sone art thow slane. Sall thow neuer play on my kne agane? Sall I neuer with my Pap se the play? Allace how sone art thow sa went away. Sall I neuer the lauchand on me se? Allace how is the dolour chancit me? Quhairin I had my onlie maist plesour, Saifand my Lord, baith be tide time and hour Is now but dout, with ane Dog clene deuorit, And neuer agane to the life be restorit. Quhat sall I say, this is ane cairfull cace. My onlie Sone is deid and gane allace, Sa scho murning in greit dolour and wo, The pepill about, that seing did richt so. Murnit richt sair, and of hir had pietie, In sic dolour, that Lady for to se. In the meane time the Knicht fra his Tornay, Reteirit hame, and sa saw be the way His awin Lady, lamenting in dolour, Requirit the caus of all hir displesour. Scho sayis my Lord, allace and euer mair I can not speik for greit dolour and cair, Is happinnit vs ane wonder cruell cace, Our Sone is slane, for euer mair allace With ?our Grewho?d quhome y? sa weill ?e lufit Now all that lufe on ?our Sone he hes prufit. He hes him slane, in Creddill quhair he lay, Zour Nuresis all thre ar fled away. And ?it the place quhair that the Creddill stude Zour hound lyis sleiping in ?our Sonnis blude This ?our Grewhound withouttin helpis ma Our onlie Childe all quite hes tane vs fra. Quhairfoir my self vnto the hour I die Sall neuer eit, quhill I reuengit be Vpon ?our hound, quhilk hes my ane sone slane Nor in ?our bed sall neuer cum agane, Quhill he be deid that gart my ane Sone die, Bot wo allace, this is na mendis to me. Howbeit it be ane syithment to my hart, Zit my greit wo it slokins in sum part. Thairfoir my Lord, gif ?e think it be done, Without delay, gar sla ?our Grewhound sone. The Knicht heiring thir sorrowfull tidance How to his Sone had fallin sic mischance. Hamewart in haist but baid he maid him boun And in the clois quhen he was lichtit doun The Grewhound hard horsmen into the clois, Amang the laif he knew his Maisteris voce, And vp he rais in the blude quhair he lay To his Maister the hie gait come his way, Faynt and foirfocht, come fawnand to his feit As he had wont, his Maister for to meit. Into greit Ire, quhat is thair mair to say, With his scharp sword, he claif his heid in tway And that onlie for ane word of his wife Gat his rewaird, that sauit his Sonnis life. Than past the knicht but baid vnto the haw, Persauit the blude, and als the Creddill saw. He liftit vp the Creddill as it stude. Fand the barne haill, and als mekill spilt blude Persuand sine of the Serpent the heid, The skin and taill, that had fochin to deid. And fand his Sone withouttin wan or wound Allace he said for my gude gay grew hound, That I haue slane withouttin ony caus, Bot onlie for the voide vane wordis and sawis Of ane woman, that hes talkit in vane Quhairthrow I haue, but caus my Grewho?d slane Quhilk I persaue hes sauit my sonnis life Fra the Serpent, throw his debait and strife. Wo to the hour that now I drew my sword, Wo to the hour that hard my wifis word. Wo to the hand that suddand straik that gaue, To my best hound, that my sonnis life did saue Quhilk I lude best, without ony compair, Saifing my wife, my onlie Sone and Air. Quhilk at this time hes sauit fra the deid, And for rewaird, now he has loist his heid. But dout I wald haue geuin a thousand pound Of gude money, or I had slane my hound. Bot sen sa is I se is na remeid, My Sone is saif, and my gude hound is deid, That faucht for him, and onlie sauit his life, And I him slew throw ane word of my wife, Bot fra thine furth heir I solempne ane vow, That Ilk man sall gif credence to and trow. Heir I forsaik all Tornay and Iusting, Heir I forsaik all Halking and Hunting. Heir I forsaik rynning with scheild and speir, Heir I forsaik all faitis of men of weir, In Cristindome, bot ?it not manlynes, Heir I forsaik all armour and harnes. For I will pas now to the Halie land, And fecht with Iowis, quhill I may strike or stand Contrair Gods fais, &amp; thairto end my life This vowit yis Knicht for ane word of his wife That vnto hir gaue sic haistie credence, Withouttin caus or ?it Experience. Thairfoir my Lord ?our gude Grace I require, Gif not sa sone credence to the desire Of ?our Emprice, thocht scho be diligent, Aganis ?our Sone greit lesingis to Inuent. For ?e may weill be this same Tale persaue Quhat the Knicht gat that sa sone credence gaue Vnto his wife, and to hir wordis vane, That sauit his Sone y? same hound hes he slane Thairfoir gude Schir, &amp; pleis ?our nobill grace I wald ?e gaue na credence in this cace Vnto ?our Quene, to put ?our Sone to deid, For ?e will rew quhen thair is na remeid. As did this Knicht, his Nobill hound that slew Remeid bypast, than he began to rew. My Lord he said, haue ye betane this Taill, The Empreour said, that I haue done but faill For that gude Taill that ?e haue tauld to me, As for this day, my Sone he sall not die. The Doctour said gif that ?e do sic thing Ze do wiselie, and like ane Nobill King. Thankand ?our Grace, that onlie for my saik Zour Sonnis deid, onlie ?e haue done slaik. And sa tuke leif at the gude Empreour To his marrowis past hame with all plesour. Moralitas. This Tale vs tellis, quha list thairto tak tent That Nuresis suld not be negligent To keip thair Babis quha can not keip thair sell Fra fyre, watter, and all siclyke perrell. That may happin to ony Innocent. For in to treuth my sell this mater saw. In Edinburgh toun west vnderneth the waw Thairfoir mair sure the mater ?e sall trow, That ane Infant was swellyit with ane sow, The guttis raif furth, baith lung Leuer and gaw. The Mother left the ?oung ane on the flure In blankets sit, quhilk barne hir awin self bure, Past hir way furth, and or scho come agane The gredie sow had this ?oung Babie slane. This my self saw, I may say it mair sure. Thocht I not saw this vther I hard tell How ane woman past furth bot to the well And left her Bab, in the Creddill sleipand Or scho returnit, the hous was all byrnand. And the ?oung Bab, deuorit with fyre sa fell. Mony mischeifis and also greit offence Hes oft occurit be Nureis negligence, That thair Babeis leifis in the hous alane Quhilk is the caus of mony barnis bane, As is oft sene be gude Experience. Thairfoir Mothers and Nuresis I protest Quhen that ?e put ?our ?oung Babeis to rest Leif not the hous alane all desolait Quhat may bechance oft times richt small ?e wait To eshew danger do ?e the liklyest. Als in this Tale I fynd ane vther thing, How the Serpent lay in the hoill lurking Waitand quhill that the hous was at quyet Mony seruandis now preuelie playis the Pyet Muche taking out, and small gude will inbring Thir to Serpentis richt weill I may compair Fra thair Maisteris ay takand lait and air As Beif, Bacon, malt, meill baith clais and coilis, Takand ay out, and hydand into hoils, Thir ar Serpents I say to ?ow but mair. As to this Knicht, quhilk his gude hound hes slane That sauit his Sone fra all perrell and pane ?e may persaue by gude Experience It is not gude to gif haistie credence To wyfis wordis, that ar baith fals and vane. Unto the tyme thay had perfytelie sene How the haill caus and mater it had bene. Quhen thay had knawin the vtter veritie Than had bene tyme the Dog to haue gart die, Also the Nureis na way I can mak clene. Sine throw the word of ane vane wickit wyfe, Quhilk oft is caus of mekill sturt and stryfe, Causit him to do the thing he did sair rew Becaus the treuth that tyme clene be misknew, And gart him reif fra his gude hound the lyfe. Quhilk Instantlie forsuik rynning of speir, All merynes, and honest faitis of weir, All vail?eant acts of Iusting and Tornay Hunting, Halking, and all sic game and play His awin Realme als, for euer mair forbeir. ?e Maryit men tak heir Experience, And siclyke als perfyte Intelligence Fra haistie wordis of ?our wyfis to eschow For thay will say, and gar ?ow traistlie trow Quhilk is not worth ane schelfull of credence. O wickit wicht, thow dois all that thow can With fals Ingyne, euer to tempt the man Quhen maist he makis him self for to distroy Than art thow blyth, than makis thow mirth and ioy Wa worth thy wit, thy banis he may sair ban. Maryit woman that ay castis thy Ingyne Thy awin marrow euer to put to pyne. Sa thow obtene thy foull lust and plesour Not regarding na way thy awin honour, Quhilk thow not cairis for ane auld trump to tyne. Curst creature, and also shameles seid Ane honest turne I can not of the reid, Excepting ane that bure the blysfull byrth Quhilk with his blude brocht vs all to greit myrth, To pray to him doutles thow had greit neid. Ane laude and praise to the Doctour that put of the perrell of the first day be his Tale telling to the Empreour. O Pantillas with thy sweit suggurit toung, Quhilk in greit Realmes and Kinrikis hes bene roung, And now at lait to this gude Empreour Quhilk sweit sentence thow hes baith said and soung And fra all dout and danger doun hes doung The Empreouris greit and ringand feirce furour Quhairthrow thow hes procurit sum succour Vnto the Chylde, on Gallous suld bene houng Had not thow bene, God thank the gude doctour. The secund Tale of the Emprice. To the Emprice word past Incontinent, That the Kingis sone had not tholit Iugement Quh? scho that hard but tary scho fell do? For sturt and noy, into ane deidlie swoun. Quhairof word come vnto the Empreour, That his Lady had tane sic displesour. And sa anone fast hidder he him sped, Fand hir richt sair murning into hir bed. Sa he Inquirit, at hir quhat was the caus Scho said my Lord, thair is anew that knawis Quhat eirdlie schame, dispite and displesour Done be ?our Sone, and to my dishonour, Quhairof I can be na way get remeid, And ?e promeist this day he suld be deid, But wo allace I dout richt wounder sair, It sall ?ow chance as did ane Hird and Bair, The Empreour said Madame I ?ow Inquire That Tale to tell, for it is my desire. To heir it tauld be ?ow the suith I say, Quod scho my Lord I tauld ane ?isterday. Of it followit richt small effect or nane Quhairto suld I ane vther tell agane. Howbeit thairto that ?e gif greit credence, To set it furth ?e mak richt small defence Zit not the les this time I will tell How with ane Bair and Scheiphird it befell. Vpon a time thair was ane Empreour Of greit wisdome, greit puissance &amp; honour Ane fair Forest he had plesand to se Baith gay and trim, with mony semelie tre. Quhairin thair was rinning ane grit wild bair Baith day and nicht he maid thairin repair. All kind of folk that this Bair micht ouirta. Without mercie he did deuoir and sla. Sa that nane durst out throw the Forest pas, For dout of deid, the way sa perrellous was. Quhairof the King was heuie in his minde, That his pepill was slane on siclike kinde. With ane dum beist deuorit to the deid, And be na way thairof culd get remeid. In his Impyre, ane cry he gart proclame, On his behalf, Authoritie and Name. Quha wald debait or bauldlie tak on hand With that brym bair in battell for to stand, And him vincus be strenth of stalwart straik, His ane douchter he suld haue to his maik, Efter his deid, his Realme as he war Air, This he suld haue, quha euer slew the Bair. This was proclamit throw his Kinrik and l?d Bot nane was found, the deid wald tak on h?d Except ane Hird, that in him self tuke heid Micht I this Bair (quod he) bring to the deid. Not onlie I, bot all my kyn also Suld throw that deid bruik euer warldlie Io. And euer mair in estimatioun be. Sa I had hap to gar that dum beist die. Quhilk I sall do, or ells to lois my life, Se I that Bair, we salbe at the strife. And sa he tuke his Scheiphirdis staf in hand. Past to the wod, quhair he the Bair sone fand. Ze may persaue how sone the Bair him saw, Without delay toward the Hird did draw, With sic ane faird, and als ane felloun feir. The sillie Hird durst neuer cum him neir To saue his life, to se gif he had hap, But mair debait vp in ane tre he lap. Incontinent quhen that the Bair sa saw The tre to bite began and als to gnaw, Sa that the hird was sair feirit in ane part That the tre crop he suld gar turne dounwart, Bot ?it the hird bethocht him on ane wile, How that he suld this brim bauld bair begile, It chances sa, this tre was laidin fow Of Nobill frute, quhilk ay the hird did pow Quhilk he kest doun ay to the Bair to eit, Quhairof the Bair was blyith that he gat meit And fillit him so, that he list weill to sleip, The hird that saw, and doun the tre did creip. Be that ane arme he hang into the tre, With that vther the Bair richt quyetlie Vpon the wombe richt softlie can he claw, The Bair sleiping persauit weill he saw. At the tre rute, the Bair quhair that he lay With his Braig knife his throt cuttit in tway. Sine brocht his heid vnto the Empreour With all blyithnes, triumph and greit honour, Saying gude Schir, and pleis ?our nobil grace Zour greit wyld bair I haue him killit throw cace Not douting bot, ?our cry ?e will fulfill, Ze causit proclame with ?our counsall and will Quhat euer he was, that wald kill ?our wilde Bair He suld mary ?our douchter and ?our Air. Quhen all ?our Court refusit the same to do With ane stout hart I set my mynd thairto. And now on case the same man chancit am I And I desire ?our Grace fulfill ?our cry. The Empreour said, all that I causit proclame Compleit I not, it is to my defame. Quhat suld be mair, thair he gat till his wage The Empreours douchter, &amp; Realme in heritage Quhen the Empreour past fra this mortall life, The haill Impire he bruikit and his wife. And sa the Hird on bak he clew the Bair, Quhairthrow he gat the Kingdome euer mair. Quod scho my Lord, haue ?e not vnderstand Quhat I haue said, quod he I tak on hand. Quod scho my Lord ?it than it war na skaith, Thocht I ?ow tald the Tale and sentence baith. The Declaratioun of this Tale. This michtie Bair betakinnis zour persoun, Throw quhais greit micht, wit wisdome and renoun, This haill Impyre ze gyde and als defendis And punishes quhat persoun that offendis. This Hyrd I may to zour Sone weill compair. That zow wald sla, as this Hird did the Bair. With his cunning dois claw zow on the wame, Quhill that ze sleip, and syne put zow to schame. Or ellis zow slay, outher be day or nicht, This zour Sone dois be his Science and slicht, That he may bruke baith zour Impyre and Croun He cairis nathing quhat cum to zour persoun. Euin as his Maisteris with thair fals fenzeit sawis Dois zow ay glois, as all the warld weill knawis Thairfoir my Lord as ze will haue weilfair, Remember weill on the Scheiphyrd and Bair, Than said the King, God forbid that sa be That chancit the Bair, that sic thing chance not me. Bot not the les, Madame for zour gude Taill, My Sone the morne salbe hangit but faill. My Lord (said scho) gif ze compleit that thing Than sall ze do lyke ane wyse Nobill King. Moralitas. Cvrage prouokis hardynes, Quhilk twa Ingenneris strang manheid Quhilk twa adionit with happynes Makis a man debait his pleid, Richt sa into this cace, this Scheiphyrd did purches The fair Madin als sweit as meid, With all hir land and gold sa reid, God grantit him sic grace. Auenture gude and haue ay gude, for debait makis destanie For euin with this scheiphird stude, outher to do or els to die He was sa stout and sture, of his lyfe tuke na cure, Thairfoir wald thow estemit be, set all on auenture, And for to purches honestie.

Ane reproche to the Emprice. The crukit comparisouns of zour wylde Bair Will win zow na warisounis, to zow I declair Of hell thow art the snair, plutois playfule in plane In hell than hald the thair, and cum not heir agane Bot still their ay remane, to be houng be the hals Into perpetuall pane, becaus thow art sa fals. The morrow come, and but mair auisement The Empreour set him self in Iudgement. Condampnit his Sone on Gallous for to die, Without respect, that alkin man micht se. He being led out throw the streit and toun With greit regrait, and sair lamentatioun. The nixt Maister come than the way ridand, And saw the Child to the Gallous gangand. Quhairat he was baith sad and sorrowfow, Bot ?it the Childe to his Maister did bow, Inclynit his heid, as he wald said him to, Maister mak speid, ?e ken quhat is ado. The Maister than prickit sa in that stour, Quhill he lichtit befoir the Empreour, With reuerence, as weill culd him effeir, And at his Grace richt humblie culd he speir. O my gude Lord quha geuis ?ow this counsell Withouttin caus ?our awin sone doun to quell Is it ?our wife that siclike garris ?ow do? Perchance ?e sall vpon war hap cum to, Th? ch?cit ane knicht yat throw his wifis fals sawis Was put to schame, w?out querrel or caus Than said the King, gude maister I require ?ow Schaw me that Tale &amp; blyithlie I sal heir ?ow My Lord he sayis, will ?e gar call agane Zour onlie Sone, quha is to suffer pane, I sall ?ow tell my Tale furth to the end. And sa the King agane for him did send. Put him in waird quhair that he was beforne, Quhill that the Tale was done and til y? morne Sa the Maister the secund Tale began Befoir the King, and mony Nobill man. As ?e sall heir, thairfoir gif audience, But mair delay, and to ?our reuerence. The Tale of the secund Maister. In ane Cietie thair was ane Ancient Knicht That had maryit ane Lady fair and bricht, As ?e haue ane, my Lord to ?our plesour And held hir vp in all eis and honour. Lufit hir sa weill, abone all eirdly thing, Sic as ?e do your Quene my Souerane King. He lude hir sa, he culd not eit nor drink But hir presence, sa on hir ay did think. And als at euin quhen all folk to bed past, The ?ettis and dures siclike he lokkit fast, And all the keyis vnder his heid thay lay, Euerilk nicht quhill morne that it was day. And at ilk morne quhen he thocht time to rise, Oppinnit the dures him self as was the gise. In that Cietie was ane custome and Law, Cryit oppinlie, that Ilk persoun micht knaw. At ane set hour ane Bell was roung at nicht, That all micht heir, and vnderstand full richt, And thairefter withouttin mair delay The watche was set to walk quhill it was day. Sine efter that, gif thay culd ony meit Gangand allone, or walkand on the streit. Sone thay war tane, and vnto presoun led, Quhill on the morne that all men rais fra bed, Thay war fast bound to ane stock or ane tre, To thair greit schame, that all the toun micht se Sine efter that, Induring thair lifetime Thay war repute as giltie of ane crime, And haldin furth fra all gude companie, This was the Law that time of this Cietie. This foirsaid Knicht quhairof I spak of air, Was growin in age, ane auld man and ane hair His rampand rage of ?outh he had compleit, And had slokinnit of bedsolace the sweit. Howbeit he lude his Lady weill aneuch. Zit as ?e ken, mair graith pertenis the pleuch. And scho persauit of sic craft he did faill Scho tuke in heid ane vther to assaill, And sa scho did, ane man of tender age In lustis bour for to win vassalage, Quha had ane quyet Chalmer in the toun, Sa euerie nicht efter this Knicht lay doun, Vnder his heid the key scho staill away, To hir ?oung lufe scho went quhair that he lay And sa scho did, als oft as euer scho list, Tuke furth the keyis that hir husband not wist And quhen scho come fra hir tryst and hir trane, Scho laid the keyis vnder his heid agane. So it befell vpon ane wynter nicht Ane walking come vpon this Elderin Knicht He culd not sleip, ?it walking as he lay, He turnit about, and mist his wife away, Vpon hir Name he cryit ofter nor thrise, Scho answerit not, than he begouth to rise, Socht all the hous be na way culd hir find. And wist not weill gif scho was out or in. Socht his bed heid quhair that the keyis lay, Quhat wald ?e mair thay war all tane away, Past to the ?ettis, all oppin he thame fand, But mair auise he closit thame fra hand, In ane windo that oppinnit vp to the gait Mekill of the nicht thair sat he at the wait, And quhen it was about the thrid Cok craw Makand hir hame, his awin wife he saw, Quha fand the ?ettis vpon hir lokkit fast, Ze may weill wit that scho was than agast. Neuer the les becaus the ?ettis was lokkit, For to win in peirtlie thairat scho knokkit. Than said the Knicht, O thow woman vnclene Thinkis thow honour on streit now to be sene? O wickit wife, and wofull waryit wicht, Quhy hes thow now dissauit thy awin Knicht Of quhom thow knew all hail thow had y? hart Of thy bawdrie now I am weill expart. For this is not the first time thow hes done Sic harlatrie, thow sall rew be ?one Mone. Quhill the watche cum thair still ?e sall remane And as Law will, thairefter thoill the pane. Than said the wife, my Lord quhy say ?e sa, Quhair I was now, thair was witnes far ma. My motheris Mayd scho come and fetchit me, Quhilk lyis richt seik, and is in point to die. And than becaus I saw ?ow weill on rest, To wakin ?ow I thocht it not the best. That gart me steill the keyis fra ?ow away, I thocht pietie to walkin ?ow as ?e lay. For quhy ?e ken ?e ar febill and auld To walkin ?ow of ?our first sleip ?e wald Bene seik the morne, and wonder Ill disposit, Thairfoir craib not, that ?our ?ettis was unclosit And my Mother als is sa wonder seik, Ane word to me, skarslie scho had to speik. Anoyntit ellis, and maid hir latter will And now my self hes haistit me ?ow till. Thairfoir gude Lord I pray ?ow hartfullie Tak na suspect, nor think na fault in me. For I had neuer sic thing in my thocht Sen the first time to ?our bed I was brocht, Nor neuer had sic thing into my hart Nor neuer sall, quhill deid vs twa depart. Thairfoir I pray, ?e lat me not be tane With the to? watche, heir standing mine alane For now the hour approches wonder neir. That the watche rise, &amp; thay will find me heir, Quhilk is to me ane euerlasting schame, And als to ?ow it is ane greit defame. War I gyltie or ?it committit crime. I wald witschaif ?e held me out this time. Than said the Knicht doubtles ?e cum not in, For na prayer of ?ow nor all ?our kin. Quhill that the watche betak ?ow in the snair, Than quhair ?e war, to thame ?e mon declair. Than the wife said, my Lord gif sa ?e do In greit defame of vs baith it cummis to, And all our kin, Alya and our freindis, And all vther that ather of vs pertenis. Gif I be heir now with the toun watche found I rather gif ane hundreth thousand pound. Quod he Ill wife, and woman far defamit. Thow hes sa done, yat thyself thow hes schamit Far better war for thy falt puneist be, And heir thoill schame, that all mankind may se Nor for to thoill punischment efter deid, In birnand hell, quhair thair is na remeid. Than said the wife my Lord I ?ow require, In this ane point to fulfill my desire. Now for his saik that deit vpon the tre, Thoill not sic schame sa saikles cum to me. The Knicht answerit vnto his wife agane, Ill wickit wife thy wordis ar all in vane, Thow c?mis not in vnto the watches knaw, And be puneist efter the cours of Law. Than said the wife I persaue this is done All for Inuy, and ?e ar Inoportune. Than sen sa is, ?e ar Impatient, I will ?ow schaw in few wordis my Intent. My Lord ?e knaw at this ?et standis ane well Quhairin but dout now I sall drowne my sell, Rather nor I, and all my kin be schamit, And als ?our self sall not chaip vndefamit Th? said the Knicht wald God yat sic had bene Lang time befoir I saw ?ow with mine Ene. Sa as thir twa togidder was at talk The Mone wox dark, and hid was vnder walk Than said the wife, my Lord and be ?our will That I heir bide, the same I mon fulfill. Or I bide heir, and for to schame my sell Rather I sall be drownit in this well. Bot I will do as ane gude Cristin wicht, Aucht to hir Lord, and to ane Nobill Knicht. Zit or I die my minde is and Intent Befoir ?ow heir to mak my Testament. Heir to the Lord first I bequyth my Saull, My banis to ly in the Kirk of Sanct Paull, As for my gudes, had I ten thousand pound. Ten thousand ky gangand vpon the ground, Als mony Plewis gangand vpon the land, Als mony scheip as thairvpon micht stand. I wald leif all vnto ?our awin persoun, Thame to dispone at ?our awin discretioun. And gif ?e pleis ony thing for to deill Into Almus, for my weill and Saull heill, That I refer to ?our awin wit and will, Quhat euer ?e pleis, the same for to fulfill. For weill I wait ?e will do bot the richt, I say na mair my sweit husband gudnicht. As scho that said, in hir armes culd scho tak Ane mekill stane, and in the well did swak. That being done, scho come richt preuilie To the ?et cheik, and stude thair quietlie. The Knicht heiring the stane fall in the well, Beleuit weill it was the Lady sell. And said allace, my wife is drownit but dout, Sa in ane fray the Knicht come rinnand out, And to the well he sped him but mair baid, The wife that saw, and in at the ?et scho slaid, And closit the ?et richt wonder sure and fast, To the windo in haist scho culd hir cast. In the meane time the Knicht stude at the well, Murning richt sair and saying to him sell. Wo be the hour that euer I was borne, My lufit wife allace is now forlorne. Wo be the hour that euer I closit my ?et, Wo be the hour in my windo I set To spy my wife, quhilk I wait was saikles, I am the wite now of hir deid doutles. Allace, allace, now is thair na remeid Throw wilfulnes of vs baith scho is deid. The Lady hard, in windo quhair scho lay, And to the Knicht with sturdie wordis culd say O ?e auld fule, that suld be callit ane Knicht. Quhat do ?e thair standing this time of nicht, Out of ?our bed walking sa wonder lait, Waitting ?our hures and harlotis on the gait. Micht it not serue my body at ?our will, Bot ?e wald pas ?our auld huredome vntill. This is nichtlie ?e vse the same passage, Ze sall repent richt sair ?our auld fulage. The Knicht knawing the voce of his awin wife He was richt blyith that scho was ?it on life. Saying Lady weill is me euer mair, Louing to God that I may heir ?ow thair. For I beleuit ?e had bene in the well, Quod scho auld fule keip the out of it thy sell. Thow seruis better for to haue punischement, For thy baudrie, nor halie gaitis to went. Quod he Lady lat ?e sic langage be, Quhat is the caus ?e say sic thing to me? Quhen I lockit the ?et ?e sall me trow I did nathing bot to haue chaissit ?ow. For in na wise I neuer did Intend Zow to displeis, or ony way offend. For quhen I hard the noyis into the well, Vnto my hart thair straik ane cruell knell, And in all haist ?e saw as I come doun Zow to preserue, that na wayis ?e sould droun. Auld dosinnit Carll (quod scho) I heir the lie, Thow was ouir peirt to Iudge sic thing to me. Bot I persaue this Prouerb is richt trew, The Iniust oft the Innocent dois persew. Thow leis to me, and hes done mony time, Euer the gilt quhen thow committis the crime, As thow dois now, that neuer to the faillit, Bot thy greit slicht as now I haue assailit, And hes the tane into the sicker snair, Quhairfoir but doubt for me thow sall stand yair Quhill watches cum, and with thame to be sene In times bygane ane auld fule thow hes bene, That me lichtlyit, thy awin wife and dispisit, And to thy hures ?eid oft times disagisit, And euer hes done, sen first time I the kend, All thy lifetime in lownrie thow hes spend. Bot God will not lat sic vnpuneist be, For mony fault thow hes done oft to me. For he is Iust, and will haue sic thing schawin And I sall mak it vnto the pepill knawin. Thairfoir st?d still, thow c?mis not in but dout Quhill the watches, and al Nichtbouris about Quhat ane thow art, thay may perfytelie knaw And thairefter to bide the straik of Law. Than said the Knicht, Lady I haue meruell To quhat effect suld ?e sic to me tell. Ze knaw richt weill that I am auld and hair, And in this toun I haue bene euer mair, And weill I wait quhair my name was proclamit Vnto this hour for na caus was defamit. Thairfoir Lady for the gude Lordis Name Thoill me cum in, and let me not tak schame. Scho said ald fule thow sp?ds thy speich in vane Thair sall thow stand, and thoil of law ye pane Better it is to thoill heir patientlie, Nor euer mair in hell condampnit be. Salomon sayis thre things that God dois hait Ane pure proud man abone his awin estait. Sine ane riche man in consuetude to lie, And ane auld man ane fond fule for to be. And sa but dout ?e bruik thir vices thre, Quhat neid had ?e sa far to lie on me. As for riches, ?e haue riches at will Quhy suld ?e than ?our speiche with falset spill? As for ane Fule, ?e are ane wonder couth, For as ?e ken the flour of all my ?outh, At ?our plesure ?e haue had euer mair, Zit to baudrie ?e ?aid baith lait and air Thairfoir God hes done wonder weill ?ow till Thocht ?e contrair baith his command and wil[l] Hes perseuerit still in ?our harlatrie, Zit he will not thairfoir ?e perischit be, Bot lent ?ow grace ?our sinnis heir repent Thairfoir ?e mon bide Law and Iudgement. Than said the Knicht my Lady best belufit, Howbeit God be contrair ane sinner mufit, Zit not the les as all sinnaris suld trow, God of his grace is to vs mercyfow, Quhat time we will forbeir and als repent, Than God forgeuis our sinnes Incontinent. Thairfoir Lady sen sic grace God vs sendis Now let me in, and I sall mak ane mendis Than said the wife with voice stout and austeir Hence the harlot, quhair deil gat we this Freir Talk quhat thow pleis, bot trewlie y? sall trow Thow cummis not in, and heir I mak ane vow And as thay spak thir wordis thame amang, In the meane time the watches bell thay rang. Than said the Knicht, gude wife let ly sic things Heir ?e not now how that the watche bell rings Suffer me not for euer to tak schame, Quhilk is forsuith degrading of my Name. Quod scho ?e wait not quhat ?one ringing menis To the weilfair of ?our saull it pertenis. Thairfoir ?e man tak all furth pacientlie For ?our pennance ?e mon thoill opinlie Ane trespassour but dout lang haue ?e bene To GOD and me, as sall be hard and sene. In the meane time thir twasum as thay talkit, Vp throw the streit the watches come y? walkit. Sone into handis thay tuik this Nobil Knicht With greit meruell, how he into the nicht Vpon the streit durst furth of ludgeing be, Thay to him said it was na Knichts dewtie: Considering weill the dout of Law he kend, He was to bauld the contrair to pretend. Scho heiring this with a loude voice scho cryit O my gude freinds, the treuth now ?e haue spyit Of that Truikour, and als ane dotit Fule, That his foule lust on na wayis he culd cule. Bot vpon hures furth passing on the nicht, Pans ?e gif sic pertenis to ane auld Knicht. That my bodie at plesour had all time, Consider now gif he committit crime: With hures all nicht, and c?ming in at morne Bot of sic faultis I haue him oft forborne. Beleuing ay sic faultis he suld haue mendit, Bot ?e may se gif he hes now offendit. Thairfoir gif ?e of sic hes correctioun, Conforme to Law ?e puneis his persoun.

Than the watches tuik him Incontinent To deip presoun with him in haist thay went. Quhill day was licht, and efter the Sone rais, With him the watche vnto the Prouest gais, Schawing to him the fassoun to the end, How on the nicht thay did him comprehend: And how to thame his wife sic plaintis maid, Incontinent the Prouest but mair baid To ane piller stude in middis of the streit, Gart set him vp fast bundin hands and feit, That all the pepill within that greit Citie To his greit schame, maid him that all micht se And sa this Knicht but ony fault defamit, Was throw his wife sa saikles euer schamit. The Doctour then said humblie to the King, And pleis ?our grace ?e haue vnderstanding Quhat I haue said, thempreour said richt weill Zour Sermone hes sentence sa haue I feill. The Maister said it sall worse happin ?ow Nor ch?cit this Knicht for treuth yis ?e sal trow Gif that ?e do for the wordis of ?our wife. Put doun ?our sone, and reif fra him his life. The Empreour said that wife was far to blame That hir husband put to sic oppin schame And he saikles, the foull Ill hir betide, Scho was the worst, that ?it did gang or ride, And for that Tale that thow hes tauld to me, This day but dout my Sone he sall not die. The Maister said, my Lord ?e doing so Within few dayis, baith plesure and greit Io Of ?our ane Sone, ?e sall haue Schir but faill, Sa this Maister quhen he had tauld his Taill, Thankit the King of his beneuolence, Sa tuke his leif, and hamewart is gone hence Moralitas.

The thrid Taill of the Emprice. The Emprice hard how all the mater ?eid And how the Childe was not ?it put to deid For verie sturt in hir minde was richt wo It was maist lik hir hart to brist in two. To hir Chalmer than scho past sone within, And thair began to skart and rife hir skin. And cryit aloude that euer I was borne, Into my Cude, sen I had bene forlorne. I being Childe to ane sa greit a King, That I suld thoill, and suffer sic ane thing, As of ?one Deuill, and ane rank Renigald, Me to deforce, sa oppinlie he wald, To my greit schame, and warldlie dishonour, I being Quene vnto the Empreour: And can heirof get na mendis nor remeid, I pray to God gif I war fairlie deid. Sa this was schawin vnto the Empreour, How his Lady was in sic displesour. Into all haist to hir Chalmer he went, And said Lady, I pray ?ow not lament, Sa Inwardlie, for it bec?mis ?ow nocht, Tak not sa far nouther in minde nor thocht. Scho said my Lord, the lufe I aw to ?ow Makis me mair sturt, in hart mair sorowfow Nor displesour of ?one dum Deuillis deid, Thairfoir gude lord sa greit God mot me speid The Inwart lufe that I vnto ?ow beir, Sa causis me remaine still with ?ow heir: or ellis I had to my Father departit, To my countrie, war not I am sa hartit To ?our behufe and plesure nicht and day, That is the caus I will not pas my way. For gif I did, than ane caus it wald be, Of greit discord, and Inanimitie: Betuix my Father and ?ow for euer moir, This is the caus I will not pas thairfoir. For weill I wait he wald reuenge my querrell, And to conqueis, put all this Realme in perrell. For my Father he is ane puissant Prence Of diuers Realmes, and of greit Reuerence. Wist he trewlie of my great displesour, I wait he wald Incres sa in rankour, That this countrie for that suld sair repent That is the caus fra him I me absent, For ?our plesour, and ?it ?e will not trow, That I wald do sic plesure vnto ?ow. The Empreour said, Madame be weil inclind Lat sic malice remoue out of ?our mind, For sa lang time as God will len me life I think neuer to faill to ?ow my wife. My Lord said scho, I pray God ?e leif lang, Howbeit that I thus leif in threip and thrang. Bot I dreid sair, and heuilie I feir, That it chance ?ow that ch?cit this hinder ?eir Of ane greit Knicht, and of his Sone alone, Efter the time that his Father was gone, Throw suddand chance departit to the deid Zit his awin Sone wald not burie his heid. The Empreour said, that was ane felloun feid The Sone wald not burie the Fatheris heid. That exempill I pray ?ow to me schaw Scho said my Lord will ?e tak tent and knaw It sall do ?ow greit gude I tak on hand, Quod he schaw furth, and lat me vnderstand. Sa scho began with all expeditioun, As scho best culd to say furth hir Sermon. In this Cietie that how is callit Rome, Quhilk in yai dayis was heid of cristindome Thair dwelt ane Knicht, the suith ?ow for to say Had bot ane Sone, and he had Douchters tway This Knicht was geuin to Halking &amp; Hunting Greit Tornamentis, and to swift hors rinning. To merynes and all kind of plesour, That micht hald vp and furth set his honour. Sa euerie ?eir sa greit riches he spent, Quhilk thrise ouircome his Rentall and his rent Quhairthrow than grew to him skant of riches His daylie cheir, and expens did decres. In that meane time thair was ane Empr[e]our Octauiane, ane man of greit honour, Quhilk in riches, sa richelie did abound, That his compair was not vpon the ground. That in so muche, he had in his treasoure Of Gold siluer, the quhilk fulfild ane Towre. Quhilk gold &amp; Towre, thocht he it had at large To ane greit Knicht to keip he gaue in charge. This vther Knicht quhome of we spak of air, That had spendit his rent and mekill mair, On Idill gammes, as Hunting and Halking. Lait sitting vp, and out of time spending. To sic pureteth he grew and greit thirlage, That he behuid to sell his heritage. He callit to him his Sone quhilk was his Air, And all the case to him he culd declair. This is the case, but dout my Sone said he, I am compeld, sa with greit pouertie, That I on force, and neid mon sell my land, Except remeid cum at sum vther hand, Quhairthrow I may, Induring my life dayis Leif honestlie, this to his Sone he sayis. For gif I chance to sell my heritage Ze ken my douchters wil want gude Mariage He said Father, gif sa it with ?ow standis That ?e on neid, analie mon ?our landis, At ?our plesure, quhairof I am content Do as ?e pleis, for thairto I consent. The Father said, now I haue tane in thocht Ane gude consait, and tell it will I nocht Bot vnto the, I knaw the Empreoure Of Gold and rent he hes fulfillit ane Towre. Lat vs twa pas, with Instrumentis be nicht, And brek the Towre with sutteltie and slicht. We sall obtene riches aboundantlie, Sall vs vphald euer in honestie, Than said the Sone schortlie to mak an end, Thair is na man that counsall can amend. It is better tak fra the Empreour Part of his Gold, his Siluer and treasour. Than ?e to sell ?our land and heritage, Quhairthrow ?our barnis, sal leif ay in thirlage Sa in ane voce thir twa did condiscend To brek this Towre, but tary thay Intend, Sa on ane nicht with Instrumentis thay past And throw the Towre ane hole thay gat at last Wan to the Gold, at larges quhair it lay, Furneist thame sekkis, and vnscryit come away Payit all his dettis, and leifit als merylie As of befoir, in alkin game and glie. In Halking Hunting and in Tornament, Quhil at the last the Gold was gane and spent. In the meane time, the keipar of the Towre Quhilk had in charge all this Gold &amp; treasour Persauit the hole, and the Gold stollin away, He was sorie, and wist not quhat to say. Into all haist past to the Empreour, And schew how theifis had stollin his greit treasour The Empreour said, in Ire all angerlie Quhat is y? caus thow schawis sic thing to me? To the I gaue, as to ane trew seruand My Gold to keip, and that thow tuke on hand At the agane, I ask it to restoir, As it bec?mis, thow sall thoill panis thairfoir. Quhen that this Knicht the Empreour sa hard say He said na mair bot humblie come his way, And saw thair was na mater to debait, He vmbethocht him self of ane consait, Thinkand richt weill that thay wald c? agane To seik mair gold, to taint yame with ane trane Befoir the hole ane Twn he gart prepair, Middillit with pick birdlime and siclike wair. Sa thick and teuch, that quha thairin c? wald Contrair thair will, yair still it wald yame hald And nane micht cum into that hole agane, Bot he moste neidis fall in that samin trane. Not lang efter, as I befoir haue said, This vther Knicht, quhen the Gold spendit had He and his Sone agane went to the Towre, To steill mair Gold than fra the Empreoure. Sa the Father first in the hole he went, And in the Twn he fell Incontinent. In to the nek, and thair stak as ane stane, Considderit weill that his Fortoun was gane. Said to his Sone cum thow fordwart no way, For at this time, I am tane for the pray. Cum thow fordwart thow sall not faill to die, And nane of vs ane vther may supplie. Than said the Sone, gif ?e may not eschaip, Than ar we baith but dout tane in the raip, God vs defend Father that sa no be, Bot at this time ?e get sum help of me. And gif I nocht may help ?ow now my sell, In haist I will baith help and seik counsell. The Father said I se is na remeid, Bot with thy sword thow mon strike of my heid And quhen thay find my deid body heidles, Than sall ?e all of this schame be saikles. Sa nane sall knaw quhat persoun did this deid Nor in quhais breist this bargane did inbreid. Than said the Sone, now Father be the Rude, Zour counsall is baith honest Iust and gude. For gif sa chancit, in this case ?e war knawin, Siclike our schame till all men suld be schawin. Sa suld we not eschaip the cruell deid, Sa I think best that I smite of ?our heid. And euin with that, as he had said the word, Out of the scheith anone he drew his sword. His Fathers heid he hint of haistelie, And in ane gutter he kest it neir hand by, Quh? this was done th? past he hame his way To his awin hous, vnto his Sisteris tway. Schew thame the case, and all the mater haill. Quha sair did weip, priuelie and bewaill. Sone efter this the keipar of the Towre, Quhilk had in charge the gold and the treasoure Quhair the hole was, within the Twn he fand, Ane heidles corps vnto the nek standand, Quhairof he had baith meruell and dredour, In haist he past and tauld the Empreour. Incontinent throw all the toun than ?eid, How thair was found ane body but a heid. Into the Twn the quhilk the Knicht did set, Quha staill the Gold, to tak him in the Net. Than to this Knicht the empreour said but faill Tak the deid corps and knit to ane hors taill, And draw it throw the streitis of the Cietie, And persaue weill quhair ony murmure be, Ony sorrow, sturt greting or murning, Than ?e may weill persaue quhair that sic thing Be attayntit, quhair ony persoun murnis Thay ar gyltie, and wait of siclike turnis, And is principall, of that Ilk hous but dout That staill the Gold, thairfoir seik weill about Gif sic ?e find, tak thame and all thair fellowis Without mercy gar hang yame on y? Gallowis. The Officers without delay thay went And completit the Empreours commandment. Quhen the Douchters the deid corps saw c? by, For Inwart wo thay gaue ane hiddeous cry. For kindlie lufe and Fatherlie pietie, To sa that corps sa drawin throw the Cietie. Quhen yair brother, the sone of yat deid knicht Hard thame sa murne bethocht him of ane slicht Quhairfoir y? corps throw the Cietie was drawin To the pepill the caus was richt weill knawin, And wist na way for to eschew the cace, Sa he him self sair woundit in the face. Quhill that the blude aboundantlie come out, That the Sisters of his life had greit dout. The officers persauit the weiping, The noyis the cry the sturt and the greting Into the hous thay enterit but delay, And demandit quhairfoir thay maid the fray. Than said the Sone, quhen my Sisters me saw Sa sair woundit, as now ?our self may knaw, Thay grat and cryit, and murnit in thair mude And as ?e knaw, few wemen may se blude. This was the caus of thair greit lamenting Of my Sisteris, we knaw na vther thing. The Officers heirto thay gaue credence, Becaus thay gat na mair experience, Bot went thair wayis dissauit all and blyndit, Caus ye richt way thay culd not seik nor find it Sine tuik the corps of this same heidles Knicht On the Gallous leit it hing day and nicht: Till all pepill did wonder and meruell Of the stollin gold, quhen thay the tail hard tell And ?it the Sone efter the Fatheris deid Wald not burie in the Kirk?aird his heid, Nor of the treis his bodie wald doun take This did the Sone for his awin Fathers sake. Ze may persaue the greit lufe and fauour To his Father he had all time and hour. The Emprice said, gude schir &amp; pleis ?our grace Quhat I haue said, haue ?e weill tane the cace? The Empreour said, Madame sa haue I seill Quhat ?e haue said, I haue it tane richt weill. The declaratioun of the Emprice thrid Taill. The Emprice said I am richt wonder wo That of ?our self and ?our Sone it be so, For his sonnis saik this Knicht as I haue tald Quhen he was pure his lands he left vnsald. Quhen he wantit he had nane vther schift For his Sonnis saik than he committit thift. And that his barnis efter that he was deid Suld haue na schame he causit strike of his heid And ?it his Sone wald not do sic rewaird To burie his heid in Kirk nor ?it Kirk-?aird: Nor he wald not nouther be nicht nor day Doun of the treis his bodie tak away. In the same sort baith nicht and day ?e laubour For to promoue ?our Sone to greit honour. Bot day and nicht he settis his Intentioun Zow for to put to vtter confusion, And ?ow destroy, is daylie his desire, That he may ring, and bruik the haill Impire My counsall is ?e rather put him doun Or he fra ?ow get the Impire and Croun. The Empreour said, sa mot I thriue and the, Ane gude exampill now ?e haue schawin to me. I micht haue tholit efter his Fathers deid, Zit be sum slicht to caus burie his heid. Trewlie my Sone he sall na langer chaip, Vpon the morne be hingit in ane raip. To officers anone he gaue command To tak his Sone, and to hang him fra hand. Doun throw the streit thay led him haistelie, To the Gallous, but mercie for to die. And as thay led that ?oung man throw y? streit All the pepill began to murne and greit, Sayand allace the Empreours onlie Childe, To the Gallous is led thair to be filde. Allace said thay, quhat is his Fathers minde To his ane Sone for to be sa vnkinde? Now this is thryis comdampnit he hes bene And few can tell quhat dois the mater mene. Bot all this c?mis be the Quenis fals consait, That he is led sa oft doun throw the gait. In the meane time doun the gait is he gone The thrid Maister come rydand namit Craton And saw the Childe sa wonder neir the deid, To his Maister ?it he Inclynit his heid, As he wald say, Maister haue minde of me, Do ?e not weill, thair is na dome bot die. The pepill cryit gude Maister haist and ryde, And for ?our childe gude help that ?e prouyde. Sa in all haist but ony mair delay, To the Palice he spurrit his gude Palfray. And quhen he come befoir the Empreour, He hailsit him with reuerence and honour. Quha maid answer to the Maister againe, Thocht ?e be cum, ?our veyage is in vaine: Zour cumming heir sall nathing ?ow auaill Ar ?e cum heir to flatter me with ?our taill? The Maister said within seuin ?eiris space Better rewaird I haue servit at ?our grace: Zit I beleue to get better rewaird, And pleis ?our grace that my talking be hard. Rewaird (said he) at my hand serue ?e nocht, For the dum boy to me that ?e haue brocht. Ze serue all seuin the verie painfull deid, Ilk ane of ?ow to Gallous for to leid: For I delyuerit my Sone speikand to ?ow Quite d? but speiche ?e seuin hes maid him now And als he wald haue defoulit my Quene, Contrair hir will, as is weill hard and sene. The Maister said, quhair ?e say he is dum, Will ?e suffer bot ane schort time to cum I find ?ow heir the michtie God to borrow That he sall speik or the fyft day at morrow For he that maid the dum man for to speik, The deif to heir, to helth restoir the seik, He will restoir ?our Sone to speik againe: Within few dayis, and that I say in plaine. And quhair ?e say he wald deforcit ?our Quene, Gif ony man hes euer hard or sene Sic conditiounis outher be lait or air Sen he with vs remanit or maid repair. That he is gyltie of all that ?e haue said, Than I thairfoir to die am wonder glaid. But Salomon sayis richt weill in his buke, Quha lykis thairin to reid and for to luke. Na malice is, nor was, nor ?it be can, Abone malice of ane Ill geuin woman. That sall I preif be ane exampill gude, That wemen are the Fontaine and the flude, The verray rute, and speciall Inuentioun Of all falset, lesings and deceptioun. And gif ?e put ?our Sone now to the deid. For ?our wifes wordis, hir falset and hir feid. It sall chance ?ow, as it did to the man That slew his Py throw slicht of the woman Quhilk Bird he lude abone all vther thing, And ay the treuth it tauld him but lesing. The Empreour said, I pray the tell me that Betuix the man, the wife, and the Pyat. The Maister said, ?our Sone againe gar caw, That he thoill not the vtter charge of Law. Than sall I tell my taill to ?our plesour, To ?our profeit, ?our weilfair and honour. The Empreour said Maister for this ane day He sall not die, cum efter quhat sa may. The Maister said God th?k ?our grace againe Sa he his taill begouth as followis plane. Moralitas. We will continew at this place, The Doctouris taill ane lytill space And sum thing we will tell Of the Emprice comparisoun How scho comparit the Kingis persoun Unto ane theif sa fell. Scho compairit the Empreour To the fals Knicht that brak the Towre Quhen he suld sauld his land, For pureteth was compellit to steill, Luik ?e gif scho compairit it leill And sa weill scho it fand. This Knicht committit tratourie That staill fra the Authoritie Outher greit thing or smaw Quhairfoir he seruit for to hing For quha that steillis ocht fra ane King Thay may not byde the Law. Siclyke this Knicht as was weill knawin, Out throw the Cietie he was drawin To his greit lack and schame Syne hangit on the Gallow treis, Persaue gif thir twa weill aggreis To the Kingis greit defame. And hir awin Empreour comparit, To ane pure Knicht was all disparit, Ane Tratour and ane theif. That scho sa wald was maist lyklie, That the Empreour sa suld be, God send hir ane mischeif. As to the Knicht wald sauld his land, And wor sa wonder pure in hand, And alwayis superspendit: Quha euer spendis by thair dew rent, But faill sall efter sair repent, Quhen he may not amend it. Thairefter cummis necessitie, Hounger, pureteth, and pouertie, To steill that he must neidis. Than tynes he honour and manheid, And thairon followis schame and deid, Of Ill spending this spreidis. Had this Knicht spendit with measure, According to his awin treasour, Efter his facultie, He suld not neid to brek ane Towre Nor stollin gold fra the Empreour Nor pure neidit not be. Gude Schirs that hes rent and riches, Be not in spending sa rekles, Bot with ressoun and richt: For than on force ?e mon sell land, Or ellis tak sum euill deid on hand As did this heidit Knicht. Quha chaipit anis, and past againe Still ay in stouth for to remaine, Quhilk all men suld forbeir. It may chance anis a man to sin But he suld na way ly thairin, Nor still to perseueir. For as that ane Knicht fand a wyle That vther Knicht for to begyle And tak him in the net, Euin sa the Feind is fyndand ay Sum new gait to fang in his pray Quhilks ay to sin ar set. The birdlyme is to hald thame still: And ay in plesure tak thair will, For as the gold was sweit. That causit this Knicht to cum againe That is in sin ay to remaine, Quhill thay ?ald vp the Spreit. Than art thow sicker in the snair, Quhen deid cummis thow dow do na mair Bot to the Gallous led. That is to hell without remeid, Than all thy gold that was sa reid It standis the in na steid. Thairfoir quha wald leif in honour Se thay thair geir spend with measour Be not ouir Liberall. Spend not in Prodigalitie, Bot as affeiris thy Facultie Or doutles want thow sall. Sum tyme may chance a man spend mair Upon ane day, nor he may spair To spend in vther nyne I grant, bot ?it ?e suld considder Put spairing dayis and thame togidder And sa small sall ?e tyne. Of spending is thre kinde of branches, The first to spend he neuer stanches, Sa lang as he hes heill, Bot euer spendand in ane rane, Quhill all that he hes is quyte gane, On force this man mon steill. The secund spendis with greit honour, With honestie and greit measour Nouther mekill nor skant, Bot sum tyme spairis and sum tyme spendis And gydis weill that God him sendis, Sa this man can not want. The thrid he is sa greit negart, To spend hes nouther hand nor hart, And ay sayis he hes nocht. Euer spairand and euer wantis, And to haue geir he neuer grantis For all that euer he wrocht. Of thir thre let vs tak the middis, The wise man that expreslie biddis Thairfoir I ?ow beseik, This is na honest man to greif, Bot se that ?e put not ?our sleif Farther nor hand may reik. Ane reproche or reprufe to the Emprice. Corruptit cors vnclene, thow springand well of vice, Thow fikkill feindis Quene, thow perrellous Ill Emprice, Thow cruell Cocatrice, and kyndlie Cocadrill For all thy taillis nice, thow sall not get thy will Fals gyglot gangland gill, thow poysonit spewand spout, Thy banis brint on ane hill, I think to se but dout. The Tale of the thrid Maister, of the Burges Pyat. Vpon a time thair dwelt in ane Cietie, Ane Nobill man, and a Burges was he: That had ane bird weill fed vp in a Cage, Quhilk we a Py do call in our langage. This bird scho was sa weill leirnit to speik, That scho culd talk Latine, Hebrew and Greik, And quhen scho had thir langages perfite, Hir Maister tuik of hir ane greit delite. Sa be proces na thing scho hard nor saw To hir Maister Incontinent wald schaw. This Burges man he had ane wife richt fair, As now ?e haue, wantoun and debonair. Quhilk ouir all thing he lufit all the best, Bot be contrair, hir lufe sa was not drest. Becaus it passit far fra the Burges micht Hir appetite to compleis day and nicht: As scho desirit, at hir plesure to haif, Quhat wald scho th?, bot cheisit ane vther knaif With hir to play, as scho thocht maist plesour, Quhome scho best lude, and held him in fauour. And sa behude hir husband on ane day to vther tounis in veyage mak Iornay, For Merchandice to by and for to sell, For Merchand men at hame ay may not dwell Bot in this warld to wander, wirk and win, Quhill of this life that thay depart and twin, Bot ?it this wife had not sic thing in minde To hir plesure hir thocht was all Inclynd. Sa quhen hir spous furth of the toun was went Without tary than for hir lufe scho sent, That thay micht mak gude cheir and mirrines As the gude wife thocht best scho culd adres. And sa thay did at thair awin appetyte, Quhen luifaris meitis of vthers takis delyte. This saw the Py, on hir Pirk quhair scho sat, Quhat mirrines that hir husie was at. And to hir Maister tauld quhen he come hame And causit hir husie to get outrage and blame. Sa thame betuix rais up ane bargane stout, Quhill mony of thair nichtbouris hard about. The gude wife said, now weill Schir I persaue Quhat greit fauour and lufe to me ?e haue. And said ?e gif mair traist vnto ?our Py Nor vnto me, and mair hir sittis by. Bot sa lang as ?our Pyat is on life It sall not faill bot we sall be at strife. The Burges said, my Pyat can not lie, All that scho seis the treuth scho will tell me. For scho can not be na way nor Ingine, Ony lesing into hir hart deuine. And thairfoir I haue mair caus for to trow All that scho sayis far better than traist ?ow. Sa day and nicht continuallie thay chide, Quhill on a day the Burges buskit to ride. In far countreis to do his Merchandice, As it effeiris sic men, and is the gise. Bot als sa sone as he his wayis went, For hir luifar scho send Incontinent. To mak hir blyith, greit solace and gude cheir, Bot on the day he durst neuer cum neir. For greit sclander of pepill and commoun vois, All the lang day quhill nicht he held him clois. As the nicht come, he knokit at the gin, Scho was reddy thairat, and leit him in. Scho said ?e ar richt welcum vnto me, Ze may cum in, for na man will ?ow se. He said my lufe, ?our Pyat sair I feir, For scho will tell all scho can se or heir. For scho raisit sic taillis betuix vs ellis That all the toun to vther plainelie tellis. Scho said feir not, bot bauldlie enter in On me I tak baith perrell and the sin. Sa he enterit, and tuik na mair in thocht, And be the hand throw the hall scho him brocht, And as thir twa throw the hall maid passage The sillie Py quhair scho sat in hir Cage, To hir husie scho hard hir luifar say We sall be blyith, and mak mirrie quhill day, For ?e ar scho that I lufe all the best, Bot I feir sair the Pyat vs molest. Quod scho feir not, I bid not for to lie ?ow It is sa mirk the Pyat will not se ?ow. Than said the Py, howbeit I may not se, I heir thy voice, for richt weill ken I the. To my Maister thow dois ane greit Iniure, For of his wife thow makis a commoun hure. And his best bed quhilk he beleuis is clene: Thow defuil?eis, quhilk is weill kend and sene Quhilk my maister quh? he c?is hame sal knaw And the trew treuth swyithlie I sall him schaw. Than said hir lufe, my hart tauld I ?ow not That we wald baith be spyit be the Pyot. And tell the treuth of baith scho hard and saw, And euerie word mak hir Maister to knaw. Tak ?e na feir thairof than said the wife, Zone talking sall perchance coist hir the life. And this same nicht I sall reuengeit be Vpon the Py, as ?e sall heir and se. Sa thay to bed past baith withouttin feir, Bot quhat become the Pyat ?e sall heir. About midnicht vp this gude wife scho rais, Cryit on hir Mayd, &amp; put on baith thair clais, Incontinent ane lang ledder thay gat, And to the rufe of the hous thay it sat. And tyruit the hous abone the Pyats Cage, Quhair y? fireflauchts &amp; raine micht get passage Blenks of Candill about the Pyats heid, Maist like fireflauchts w? cauld water yair ?eid Small stanis like peis, vpon hir heid thay kest, Maist like hailstanis, sa this pure Py was drest Sa all this nicht without ony remeid Was this Py pynit, almaist vnto the deid. Sa on the morne away the ?oung man staw At ane bak dure, quhair nane him hard nor saw Sa this Burges come hame within few dayis And to his Py first he gais to and sayis, O my best bird, now tell me of thy cheir, How hes thow fairne sen I departit heir? My bird (said he) quhat hes thow sene or hard? Tell me the treuth for thy gudlie rewaird. Maister (scho said) I sall ?ow trewlie tell, Quhat that I hard, I saw and quhat befell. Ze war not past of this toun day and nicht, Quh? that ?our wife did to ?ow greit vnricht. Ane vther man into ?our bed scho laid And all that nicht togidder thay twa plaid. And I them schew y? thay war baith to blame, That I suld tell to ?ow quhen ?e come hame. Maister but dout this is ane treuthfull taill, Zour wife is not I se for ?our auaill. To the nixt point, at me quhair that ?e speir How I haue fairne, in quhat sort was my cheir In ?our absence surelie I say ?ow richt Sa greit ane storme as thair was ?isternicht Baid I neuer, sen first time I was clekkit, Nor ?it my deid sa sair I not suspekkit: As that same nicht, but dout I say ?ow plaine, For verray feir of fyreflauchts hale and raine, All the nicht ouir it ranit sa on me, That I beleuit but dout drownit to be. Than said the wife, Schir ?e beleue ?our Py, Now ?e may knaw quhat kin a woman am I. Ze may now se, and alswa may persaif, In times bygaine how that ?our Py did raif. Ane fairar nicht was neuer on the plaine Nor was y? nicht that scho sayis it was raine: Ane fairar nicht, ane softer and mair cleir Mair plesand nicht I had not all this ?eir, Thairfoir ?e sall in all times furth to cum, Gif hir na faith na mair nor scho war dum. Than this Burges wist not weill quhat to say Bot to nichtbouris sone past he on his way And demandit gif sic ane nicht was fair That his Pyat tholit the cauld and cair. Thay said nichtbour, I walkit all that nicht, Mair solatious, mair softer and mair bricht Mair stabill ane nicht, mair curious and cleir: Nor was that nicht saw I not this seuin ?eir. Vnto his hous this Burges bownit hame, And thocht richt weill his wife had seruit na blame The sillie Py he put all in the wite, And of all faults he thocht his wife was quite. And said to hir I find ?ow traist and trew Quhairfoir ?e sall haue na caus for to rew. At my nichtbours I haue speirit all about Euin as ?e say Ilk ane thay say but dout. Ane fairar nicht thay said culd not be found, Nor was that nicht, mair softer and mair sound And it requyris to vther quha offendis With all thair hart for to mak thame amendis. To ?ow thairfoir ane garmound of the new I promeis ?ow, becaus I find ?ow trew. Scho said gude Schir sauing ?our reuerence Ze said not sa quhen ?e gaue firme credence Vnto ?our Py, quhilk falslie on me leid, Sayand that I committit sic ane deid: That neuer was into my minde nor thocht, Nor in this warld sic thing I neuer wrocht. With hir lesingis betuix vs scho hes sawin Ane greit discord, quhilk all about is knawin, Quhairthrow I am blasphemit and defamit, Throw all the toun, be ?our fals Py &amp; schamit, Quhairfoir na meit nor drink sall do me gude, Quhill that I se ?our fals Pyats hart blude, Than the Burges vnto the Pyat past, And said fals Py, tell how become this cast: Vpon my wife sa falslie for to lie, Causing discord oft times with hir and me. Is this the thank, the gansell and gude deid, Thow randers me, sa weill I culd the feid, With my awin hands, with meits delicait, Airlie at morne, and als at euin lait. Throw thy lesings thow hes maid throw the toun Ane greit sclander, &amp; foull defamatioun. Quhairto scho gaue na mair consent nor reid. Nor I my self gaue vnto Goddis deid. The sillie Py hard hir Maister say so, Intill hir hart scho was richt wonder wo. Maister (scho said) God knawis gif that I lie, Zour self will traist the verray thing ?e se. And weill I wait the thing I said to ?ow, I hard and saw, quhy suld I not that trow. The Burges said, I heir the loudlie lie, Kennis y? not weill this taill thow tald to me, Thair was ane nicht sa troublit in the Air With storme, fyreflauchts, hale, raine &amp; mekill mair Of Ill wedder thow had na vther reid, Bot bydand ay the bitter hour of deid. Quhilk is richt fals, and neuer a word is trew, Thairfoir but dout thy falset thow sall rew: And fra hence furth thow sall na lesingis mak, Nor of trew taillis thow sall not mak ane crak. And in speciall betuix me and my wife, The Law will weill that it coist the thy life. For the greit leis thow did Inuent and forge, With this same knife I sall cut out thy gorge. Sa in greit wraith he tuik hir be the nek, And with ane knife hir heid he did of snek. The wife saw that, and scho was wonder glaid To hir husband with mirrynes scho said: Now ?e haue done as ane man of prudence, Howbeit befoir ?e gaue ouir greit credence Vnto ?our Py, quhilk ay richt falslie leid, My hart is blyith quhen I se hir bleid. Now we may leif all our lifetime in rest, Sen scho is gone, that did vs ay molest. For scho was ay the verray Instrument Betuix vs twa, all lesingis did Inuent. Be blyith said he, that Instrument is hence, Forsuith to hir I gaue ouir greit credence. Now I knaw weill all that scho said was fals, Bot now thairfoir scho hes loist life and hals. The Burges then blent vp about his bigging And saw ane hole tyruit in the hous rigging, And weill persauit ane lytill Ledder stand, Ane watter tub, with stanis watter and sand, Quhilk was doun cast vpon the sillie Py, Than the Burges weill vnderstude quhairby, The pure Pyat had tauld hir taill richt trew, All the falset and fassoun than he knew: How thay had causit the Pyat for to lie, Throw thair falset and greit subtilitie. Now of my wife the falset I persaif, In time bygaine how scho hes plaid the knaif. Not regarding sin schame nor honestie, Bot on hir lufe lyand in harlatrie. Full wo is me how greit ane Fule was I, For hir falset to slay my sillie Py, Quhairin I had my plesure and delyte, Allace, allace, my wife had all the wyte. Bot in na way my self I can excuse, That hir counsall sa greitlie I did vse. Bot in ane part but dout sa I was blindit, And now the treuth full sickerlie I find it. Wa worth the time I gaue hir sic credence, Or till hir taill I gaue sic audience. Wa worth sic wifes, that ar sa Ill Inclinde, Euer hauing sic fen?eit hart and minde. With dowbill hart full of subtilitie, I ?ow assure thay ar euill companie. Becaus my wife hes wrocht me siclike wo, Heir I gif ouir all mirth, blyithnes and Io. All Merchandice, houshalding and harbrie, In time c?ming, and Pilgrim I will be, And markis me heir vnto the halie land. Becaus I find na faith in woman stand. Sa this Burges for credence that he gaif Vnto his wife, left land and all the laif. The Maister said vnto the Empreour, Schir haue ?e tane this taill into fauour: And quhat it menis, the samin vnderstand, He said richt weill, Maister I tak on hand. The Maister said was scho not ane fals wife With hir lesingis gart reif the Py hir life. The Empreour said, scho was of falset fow Hir greit lesingis nor hir life I allow. Of the pure Py, sairlie I do repent, That loist hir life for saying verament. Surelie Maister ane gude taill ?e haue tald And for ?our saik this day I sall gar hald My Sone vndeid, the morne quhill it be none, God thank ?our grace (quod he) that sic hes done To the Lord God hartlie I ?ow commend, Sa this Maister with blyithnes hame he wend. Moralitas. O mervellvovs God the subtell slicht, Siclyke I trow was neuer sene Thow waryit wyfe and wickit wicht Of this Burges wyfe now I mene Sa peirtly culd awow, and gar hir husband trow That scho sa saikles was and clene Ane Innocent as scho had bene Syne of falset sa fow. Sa full of falset as scho is Thair is bot part can it persaue For quhen thay mark to do ane mis, A thousand sundrie gaitis thay haue To bring thair mater to, quhen thay haue ocht ado. The wisest men thay ay dissaue And this Burges amang the laue. It is not sa (quod scho) Sa priuelie scho did prouyde, A posset for the sillie Py, And with sic craft scho culd it gyde Changeing the wedder and the sky Thy gad?ettis did begyle, the pure Py with sic wyle, Hurde of huredome vpon the fy, Gluttoun of Glew all we may cry Thow art ane veschell vyle.

At sum time scho will caus a man To do the thing he will repent Quhen it is done no way scho can Remeid thairof scho can Inuent Gar the saikles get wyte, mak hir self clene and quyte, Thairfoir thocht scho be Impatient, And in bauldnes hir bow all bent That cair ?e not ane myte. Be not reddy to gif rewaird, Thocht scho it serue quhill that thow se This Burges sa in mynde was mard Quhill that the sillie Py slew he, Than promeist hir a goun, or ellis ane new garmoun For hir huredome and harlatrie, And hir scabbit scurilitie, Fy Motheris Malesoun. O twyte vntrew, and taill vnsicker Kindillar of cair bald baldestrod, Thocht ane wald bind the with ane wicker Thow will not keip gude reull nor Rod. Thow art a furious flam, ane wolfe and semis ane Lam, Thow art a Tratour wylie Tod That stinkis in the neis of God, Thow art the Deuillis dam. Ane louing to the thrid Doctour and Maister. Honovr and praise gude Doctour mot thow haue, That this ane day the chylde thow hes gart saue With thy trew Taillis and exempill perfyte Beleuing weill sa sall do all the laue: Thocht the Emprice with hir Taillis wald dissaue The Empreour, all for the Chyldes dispyte, Bot at the last I wait he will hir quyte Quhen he and ze the suith weill dois persaue. Quhair ze find fault thair sall ze lay the wyte The Fourt Taill of the Emprice. Qvhen the Emprice hard y? child ?it on liue Scho grat richt sair, &amp; all hir hair did riue Sayand allace, wa worth the time &amp; hour That I was wife vnto the Empreour. Crying, murning, and ryfing doun hir face, Quhill the greit noyis past out throw all y? place The Empreour hard the murmure at the last, Incontinent he to hir Chalmer past: Inquirit the caus of all hir greit distres, Scho curst the time that scho was maid empres Wald God (said scho) quh? I come to thir parts Howbeit that I had four and twentie harts Within my bowk, that thay had all bene rent In small pecis, or I war daylie schent. On sic fassoun, as I am day be day, Bot that ?our grace sayis nouther ?e nor nay. Bot quhylis ?e say but dout ?our Sone sall die And vther quhylis in greit dispyte of me, Ze continew his life and takis na cure Of my greit sturt, the greit schame and Iniure He did to me, and als schame to ?our sell. Of this mater quhairto suld I mair tell: For it is knawin out throw the haill countrie, To quhat greit schame he purposit to brocht me Bot ?e throw sleuth dillis do? &amp; latis ouirdriue Sa day be day ?our Sone is ?it on liue. The Empreour said I pray ?ow stand content And without dout the morne Incontinent, He sall haue Law, without ony remeid, To be hangit on Gallous to the deid. Bot ?isterday it was a principall caus, That he thoillit not the Iudgement &amp; the lawis Was for a Taill that the Maister me tald Zea, than (said scho) that is y? thing thay wald Prolong the time, lipning the Court sall change Gif ?e do sa, that is ane mater strange. For thair fair wordis gude Iustice for to brek, Sa vnto GOD ?e haue ane small respek. Bot I feir sair ?e with ?our Maisters seuin, It sall ?ow chance the same exampill euin As anis it chancit into this same Cietie, Ane Empreour and seuin Maisteris had he: Quhome to he gaue credence baith day &amp; nicht, Thay him begyld with thair fals fraud &amp; slicht. The Empreour said, that taill I pray ?ow tell With the Maisters and Empreour how it fell. Scho said quhairto, or to quhat fect suld I Tell ony taill, quhen it is not set by, For ?isterday ane taill to ?ow I schew, Quhilk in the self was verray Iust and trew For ?our honour and profite I it tald, Thairon to think, ?it on na wyse ?e wald. For ?our honour and profite quhat I will say, Vpon the morne the Maisters dois away, And with thair taillis daylie turnis vp side do? Quhilk is but dout for ?our distructioun. As in this taill that I sall tell to ?ow, And pleis ?our grace, for treuth ?e sall it trow. He said Madame hartlie I ?ow require, I pray ?ow tell, for it is my desire. That be the same I may the warrar be, And to eschew falset and subteltie. Thocht I delay my Sonis saik for ane day, It not anserris nor clenelie takis away. I sall it schaw (quod scho) be it ?our will, Sa ?e will giue gude thocht and minde thairtil. Quod he tell on, and I sall heir it than, And sa at schort hir taill thus gaitis began. Vpon a time I red intill ane Quair, In this Citie sum time seuin Maisters wair Throw quhais science, greit wisdome &amp; leirning All the Impire was rewlit be thair gyding. The Empreour quhilk at that time did ring, But thair counsall, he tuik in hand na thing. Sa he thame held in sic eis and daintie, That he culd not weill want thair companie. Thay persauing his hart to thame sa kinde, His gudelie will, his daylie thocht and minde, That he culd do nathing but thair auise, Thay war all seuin haldin sa wonder wise. Thay kest in minde ane wonder subtell thing, Be sorcerie, Inchantment and cunning. That how lang time the Empreour he baid In his Palice, nouther past furth nor raid, Bot thairin still held him in companie, He saw als weill as ony man culd se. Fra his Palice gif he past ony time, Throw thair slicht craft he suld not se a stime. And this thay did to the samin Intent, That thay micht mair thair libertie frequent, And Intromet and vse the samin thingis That appertenit to Empreours and Kingis. And to dispone at thair will all his rent, This was thair minde, thair thocht &amp; als Int?t Be the quhilk thing thir Maisters did purches Vnto thame self gold geir and greit riches. And ?it howbeit throw thair greit sorcerie, Thay maid this King a stime he micht not se Of his Palice, quhen he past ay was blind, Amang thame all the way thay culd not find. With all thair craft againe to gar him se, Out of his Palice, bot euer blind was he. Abone all this, thir Maisters fand sic craft, All the Impire almaist thay maid clene daft. Gif ony man had dreamit ane vncouth dreme, The haill knawledge thairof thay suld expreme And mak thairof Interpretatioun, For ane Ducat or ?it ane Frenche Croun. Quhairby thay gat mair gold and greit tresour Almaist als muche as fra the Empreour. Sa be this way, and vthers fals and slie, Thay conqueist gold greit riches in plentie, Mair in respect nor had the Empreour, And to thame seuin geuin daylie mair honour. Sa on ane day quhen that the Empreour, With his Emprice togidder with honour At thair Tabill, to sich in hart began, The Emprice saw, persauit and said than Quhat is the caus schaw me of ?our dolour, Quhy sich ?e so, or takis ?ow displeasour? The Empreour said to his Emprice agane, Haue I not caus of sorow and greit pane, That I sa lang in sic sort suld be blind, And can thairof na gude remedie find. My Lord (quod scho) will ?e tent to my Taill, On honestie it sall help and preuaill Gif ?e will do efter as I ?ow say, Ze sall allow my Taill ane vther day. In ?our Impire seuin greit Maisters ?e haue, And I beleue thay seuin dois ?ow dissaue, And ar the caus of all ?our greit diseis, And all ?our rowmes yai gide euin as yai pleis And to thame selfis appropriatis ?our rentis, Throw thair fals wayis &amp; subtel Inch?tm?tis Gif it be so that thay ar found gyltie Ane schamefull deid doutles thay serue to die. Thairfoir my Lord for all thir seuin ?e send. And speir at thame gif thay can help to mend Zour greit diseis, and sair Infirmitie Quhair ?our sicht faillis, againe to gar ?ow se, Gif thay say nay, and can find na remeid, Charge thame schairplie vnder the pane of deid And sa ?e may consider weill and se, Gif thay be caus of ?our greit Maladie. The Empreour allowit weill this taill, And thocht richt weill it was for his auaill. Incontinent was send to thame Message, For to compeir anone thay tuik veyage, And come kneilling befoir the Empreour, Quha thame ressauit in fredome and fauour: And schew to thame his greit Infirmitie, How he was blind, and had sic Maladie. And how sum time that he saw wonder weill And vther tymes how he saw neuer ane deill. Th? chargeit he them schairplie on pane of deid Incontinent thay seuin suld seik remeid. For it was schawin to him for veritie, Thay war the caus of his Infirmitie. And gat thay not remeid Incontinent Vnto the deith thay suld be all torment, Vnto thir seuin thus said the Empreour, Quhairof thay stude in greit feir and dredour. Than said thir seuin agane with ane consent, Ze charge vs seuin with Inconuenient. With siclike charge ?our grace now putis vs to It passis far our power for to do. It is sa hard and difficill ane thing, That we can not to gude purpois it bring, Into schort time, bot gif it pleis ?our grace For to grant vs respet for ten dayis space, We sall ?ow gif answer conuenient. Quhairof we traist, ?our grace sall stand cont?t, Of thair answer the Empreour was appleisit, Beleuing weill of seiknes to be eisit. Sa thir Maisters vnto thair counsell past, To se gif thay culd find the way or cast, Fassoun, Ingine, supplie, meane or remeid, Or ony help to saue thame self fra deid. And for to haill the Kingis Infirmitie, Thay kest the way, for thame it wald not be. Quhairfoir thay war all seuin richt sorrofow And said get we na help nor remeid now To help this charge, as we Ilk ane dois ken Without remeid we ar all bot deid men. Thairfoir let vs mak trauell all fra hand, Seirche and seik furth Ilk ane in sindrie land Gif that we can in ony countrie find In time c?ming the Empreour be not blind, And sa thay socht in mony sindrie toun, Be eist, be west, south, north, baith vp and doun It hapnit thame to ryde vpon ane day Throw ane citie, quhair barnis was at the play In the meane time come to thame ane auld man And said Maisters, I pray ?ow gif ?e can Of my nichtis dreame to mak Interpretatioun And for ?our wage I sall ?ow gif ane Croun. Ane of the barnis that was than at the play, To the Maisters hard that man siclike say. And said gude man ?eis gif ane Croun to me, Quhat menis ?our dreame I sall ?ow tel trewlie The auld man said I dreamit this hinder nicht That in my ?aird of watter sprang vp richt, A fresch spring wel, quhairfra come mony spr?gs Throw all y? eird now tel quhat menis sic things. Than said the barne tak ?e ane spaid gude man In the same place, pas and delf gif ?e can, Quhair that ?e thocht the water first vpsprang: Thair ?e sall find within ane space not lang Ane hurde of gold that samin hoill within, Sall mak ?ow riche for ay and all ?our kin. Sa did this man as the ?oung barne c?mandit And as he said, this man richt sa he fand it. Than past this man to this ?oung Child agane And thocht he wald rewaird him for his pane. And offerit him ane pund of reddy gold, Quhilk be na way ressaue fra him he wold. And said gude man, na gold I will ressaif Bot pray for me, at ?ow na mair I craif. The seuin Maisteris persauing all this thing, How ane ?oung Childe of ?eiris being sa ?ing With sic wisdome the m?ns dreame did expone, Said to thame selfis we meruell quhilk is ?one, Of sa ?oung ?eiris makis sic Interpretatioun And sine thairfoir takis nouther golde nor croun Sa at this childe thir seuin Inquyrit the Name He said Merling, quhairof I think na schame. Quod thay ?our name bruik weill w? all weilfair We persaue weill, ?e haue wisdome and lair. Ane greit mater we haue to ?ow to schaw, Of the quhilk few or nane bot we dois knaw. Than said the Childe schaw me furth ?our int?t And ?e sall haue answer Incontinent. Quod thay ?oung Childe this is the verray cace Ane Maladie haldis the Empreouris grace. Sa lang as he in his Palice will byde, And not thairout nouther to gang nor ryde, He seis als weill as ane that euer was, Bot als sone as he fra his Palice pas Thair takis him than sa greit ane Maladie, That all about a stime he may nocht se. And gif ?e can the caus heirof discus, First ?e sall haue ane gude rewaird of vs, And secundlie, remeid gif ?e can find In time c?ming the Empreour be not blind: Out of Palice quhen he plesis to pas, He will ?ow gif rewaird quhat ?e will as. Than said the Childe his Maladie I knaw, Als the remeid thairof I can him schaw. The Maisteris said we pray ?ow richt hartlie Pas with vs seuin and beir vs companie, Quhill we cum to the Empreouris presence, Quhair ?e sall haue rewaird and reuerence. Than said the Childe Schirs I am reddy now Pas quhen ?e pleis, and I sall gang with ?ow. And sa all aucht Incontinent past hence, Quhill thay come to the Empreouris presence. And quhen thay come befoir the Empreour, Thay hailsit him with reuerence and honour. And said gude Lord, sindrie lands haif we socht To get ?ow health and heir we haif ?ow brocht Ane gude ?oung Child y? knawis ?our Maladie At ?our plesure will find help and supplie. In time c?ming, that ?e sall weill persaue, Zour daylie health, and na seiknes to haue. Nouther in ane, nor in nane vther pairt, He hes sic wit in gude cunning and Airt. The Empreour vnto thir Maisters said, Of ?our tythance I am richt wonder glaid. All that he sayis will ?e seuin tak on hand, Ze Schir said thay at that same we will stand. For we haue sene be gude experience, His greit wisdome, craft and Intelligence. The Empreour than vnto the barne he said, Sen sic a thing gude Childe is to ?ow laid: The caus thairof at ?ow I wald Inquire, And sine my helth than hartlie I desire. Than said the Child and pleis ?our nobil grace We twa alone mon talk ane lytill space, In ?our Chalmer I sall ?ow schaw trewlie, The caus of all ?our greit Infirmitie. And quhen he was into the Chalmer led, He causit cast of all the clais of the bed, Quhilk into haist the Empreour causit be done My Lord he said now heir ?e sall se sone Ane meruellous thing, quhilk ?e hard neuer tell Vnder the bed thair was ane mekill well, Of quhilk thair rais ane foull smuke and a reik That wald haue maid a man baith blind &amp; seik Out of this well thair springs seuin greit spr?gs The Empreour than he meruellit of sic things Vnder his bed to be and he not wist, Sa greit a well sa foull ane reik and mist. He said my Lord, heir planelie ?e may se The verray caus of ?our Infirmitie. Without ?e put thir springis and well away, To get ?our sicht agane na wise ?e may. The Empreour said I pray ?ow to me tell, The nerrest way for to vndo this well. Than said the Chylde thair is na way bot ane Gif it pleis ?ow, on force it mon be tane. The Empreour said I pray ?ow richt hartlie Schaw me the way, gif sic ane thing may be Gold nor gudis on na way will I spair Sa that the treuth to me ?e will declair, Gif mannis craft, his naturall wit or micht, Perfite cunning with gude science or slicht, Subtell Ingine, Airt or experience, Micht help my sicht, or thairfoir find defence, I wald not cure for to gif gold plentie, Spair for na coist sa that ?e gar me se Without my place als weill as I do in, Sa ?our rewaird fra me weill sall ?e win. Now sen ?our grace to me hes geuin credence, I sall ?ow schaw be gude experience, The verray treuth thir seuin springis ?e se spring Out of this well, thay ar na vther thing, Bot the same seuin Maisters be thair science, Quhome to ?e gif sa firme and greit credence, Quhilk be thair craft c?ning and Inchantm?t Zow to mak blinde, this well thay did Inu?t. That hiddertillis, baith ?ow and ?our Impire Lang time bygane hes reulit at thair desire. About ?our place euer hes maid ?ow blind, To that effect that na fault ?e suld find Done ony way be thame or thair consent, That thair greit gyle suld not be maid patent, Nor heir c?plaintis of ?our Barro?is &amp; Lordis Bot thay allone to aggre sic discordis: Nor that Iustice suld ring into ?our land, Bot all sic things suld ly into thair hand. And ?our subiectis to spuil?e euerie day, All that was grene, to ?ow it suld seme gray, Ze not seing now suld thay all be deid, For ?our kyndnes, thay can find na remeid. The Empreour said, now ?e haue to me schawin Of my blindnes, the caus and maid it knawin Now the remeid thairof I wald ?e fand, Ze sall not want baith gold, Lordschip &amp; land. And pleis ?our grace now to ?ow sall I tell, The verray treuth, will ?e do my counsell. Of ?our blindes gif se desire remeid, The first Maister, tak and stryke of his heid, Than ?e sall se the first spring of the well Be quyte away, this is the treuth I tell.

Quhilk in gude haist was done as thay thocht richt And sa agane the Empreour gat his sicht. And this ?oung Childe rewardit richt richelie Maid him ane Lord and Air of ane countrie. Than said scho Lord, haue ?e persauit this taill That I haue schawin, for ?our gude and auail He said richt weill, and thankis ?ow hartfullie, For that gude Taill that ?e haue tauld to me. In the same sort thir seuin Maisteris said scho Vnto ?our grace thay purpois for to do. Be thair fals Taillis, and siclike fen?eing, That ?our curst Sone may ay abone ?ow ring Quhilk God defend, ay quhill the hour I die, That I neuer ane vther Empreour se.

Doun throw the streit as Officers him led, Ane Maister come, and at the spurris him sped. To the Empreour with all gude reuerence, Quhome to he said, pas swyith fra my presence, For the gude saind that ?e haue send to me: Ze serue all seuin on Gallous for to die.

Thairfoir rewaird na thing ?e serue of me, Bot ?e all seuin with him sall hangit be. The Maister said, I seruit ane better thing, To my rewaird, nor on Gallous to hing. Quhair ?our grace sayis, y? now ?our sone is d? God knawis the caus, the time is not ?it cum. Of his speiking the time will cum at schort, Thairfoir I pray ?our grace to tak comfort: And ?e sall se the day approche richt neir, That he sall speik, quhil all this place may heir As to ?our Quene, in that point quhair ?e tell It is not prouin, nor nouther is gospell.

It sall be war with ?ow I dar weill say, Nor chancit ane man and his wife on ane day: Quhilk I sall schaw to ?ow be narratioun, And preif the same be gude probatioun. The Empreour said, trow ?e to do with me As seuin Maisteris did anis in this Cietie With thair fals taillis vnto thair natiue King Nay, nay, not sa, it sall not be sic thing. The Maister said, the fault of ane or two Suld not redound to rebuke blame or wo Of all vthers, for it is richt weill kend Baith gude and Ill is to the warldis end.

The Taill of the Fourt Maister. Vpon a time thair was ane eldering Knicht Wise and wittie, full of riches and micht. Had leuit furth mony dayis of his life, Without children, Lemman or maryit wife. Diuers times his freindis come him till, To se gif it was his plesure and will To tak ane wife, and barnis to furth bring. Throw thair counsall he grantit to sic thing. Sa at the last thay gat his wife to be The Prouestis dochter of all that greit Cietie, Quhilk was richt riche, weill fauourit and fair Weill maid at will and was hir Fatheris air. Fra he hir saw, he was sa tane in lufe, That he his hart fra hir culd not remufe. Thocht lufe &amp; fauour betuix them micht be sene Zit all thair space na barnis was thame betuene Vnto the Kirk as scho past throw the streit, With hir Mother scho hapnit for to meit. Ather vther hailsit with greit blyithnes, And sa began to talk in mirrines. The mother said, my dochter tell me how Ze pleis ?our spous, or how dois he to ?ow? Scho said richt Ill, and not with him content, For he is auld, febill, and Impotent. Quhen ?e me staikit vpon sa auld ane stick, I wald but dout ?e had me buryit quick: For or I come with him in naikit bed to be drownit I had rather be led: Or ly with swyne, or I lay be his syde, My flesche it vggis quhen y? I tuitche his hyde Hald me excusit I pray ?ow hartlie Mother, For it is force that I mon haue ane vther. The Mother said my gude douchter and deir, Heir I the pray sic fulischnes forbeir. With ?our Father mony ?eiris I haue bene, Sic thing of me was neuer hard nor sene. Mother scho said, of that na meruell is, For ?e twa met in ?outhheid Ioy and blis. And sa Ilk ane togidder had solace, It is not sa with me into this cace. Or I him gat ?e ken his strenth was gane, He lyis as still beside me as ane stane: For he is waik, auld, cauld, waistit and dry, And as ?e ken Mother sa am not I: Bot in my flouris, of ?outhheid blumand grene Compair thairfoir is not vs twa betwene. Of his bodie I can get na solace, To me thairfoir it is ane heuie cace. Scho said douchter gif sic thow hes in minde, And to fulage thy hart is sa Inclinde. Tell me thy minde without fen?eing in breist, Quh?e will thow lufe (quod scho) mother a preist The Mother said, gif sic thow wald desire, I think les sin to lufe ane nobill Squire. Or ane gay Knicht, nor a Priest to thy lufe, Scho said Mother, thairin I ?ow reprufe. Gif that I lude a Knicht or ?it a Squyre, Within schort time of my lufe thay wald tyre. And tell ouir all into thair merines, And sa me schame, to my greit lichtlynes. It is not sa ?e ken with men of Kirk, For with wisdome and wylines thay wirk And is als laith thair honestie to tine, In sic affairis, as I wald to do mine: And counsall keip als quyetlie vnschamit, As ?e or I, with our spous wald be blamit. Also Kirkmen bene mair kinde to thair lufis, Than vtheris ar, als weill the prettick prufis. Scho said dochter heir my gude counsall now And it sall be ane gude profite for ?ow. Auld men ?e ken ar wonder cautelus, Wylie and fell, and richt outrageus. In ane maner ?e sall ?our husband preif, Him for to temp, or anger him or greif. Than gif ?e chaip but reprufe or smyting, Lufe quhome ?e pleis, at ?our lust and lyking. The dochter said, sa lang I may not byde, In all gude haist sum lufe I mon prouyde. God hes me send sa vnhappie ane weird, That I can get na solace in this eird. And ?e ?our self Mother asweill ?e ken Quhat Ill occurris to want plesure of men And I rather drink water for ane ?eir, Or I sa lang plesure of men forbeir. The Mother said dochter for my blyssing, Byde quhill thow preif or temp him w? s? thing For ?our blyssing scho said I will do mair Bot him to preif, I pray ?ow to declair. In quhat fassoun, or quhat way it may be Scho said dochter that sall I haistelie. In ?our Orchard thair is ane tre that standis, The maik thairof thay say is in few landis. In quhilk ?our spous hes greit lufe and lyking, Await sum day quhen he gais in hunting. Caus the same tre Incontinent be cuttit, And bring it hame or euer ?our husband wit it. Thairof mak fyre agane his c?ming hame, Than gif ?e chaip without reprufe or blame, At ?our plesure than ?e may tak the Preist, This will ?e do for ?our Motheris requeist. Scho said Mother ?our counsall I will do Howbeit in treuth I am richt laith thairto. Ilk ane hame past vnto thair awin ludgeing, The Knicht meruellit of his wifes tarying. Scho said gude Schir as I went west the streit, With my Mother on chance thair culd I meit. Scho speirit of me gif ?e war in glaidnes, I said euin sa, and than hame did me dres. Efter denner the King past in hunting, Bot his gude wife thocht on ane vther thing. And thocht that hir purpois suld cum to end, Incontinent for the Gardner scho send. Quhome to scho said cut down this tender tre, That I thairof may mak on haistelie: Ane greit warme fire agane my Lords c?ming He will beliue cum hame from the hunting. This day is sour, sa wonder schairp and cauld, And as ?e knaw he is febill and auld. Quhen he c?mis hame that he sall not want fire Thairfoir cut doun and ?e sall haue ?our hire. To quhome he said, saif ?our plesure Madame, Cut we this tre but dout we will get blame. For ?our husband far better lufis this tre Ten times ouir, than all the treis heir be, Bot not the les Madame at ?our desire Vther fallin wod I sall get to be fire. Quhairof my Lord (quod he) will stand content Nay, nay (said scho) cut doun Incontinent. He said na way this tre I will destroy, For it will put my Maister to greit noy. Scho heiring that, he wald not do command, The Gardnaris Ax, scho hint into hir hand. The tender tre scho cuttit at the rute, That fra thine furth it suld neuer haue frute. Causit seruandis the samin hame to beir, Of hir husband thairof taking na feir. The Knicht at euin fra hunting c?ming hame, Hunting the wylde in Forest with the tame. His wife him met, and said gude Schir I knaw Ze ar werie and wonder cauld with aw, I causit to big ane fire to ?ow thairfoir, To mak ?ow cherie, and mirrie be the moir. I thank ?ow dame said he with all my hart, Get I gude cheir, than ?e sall haue ?our part. Than in he come, and sat doun on ane bink, Befoir the fire, and cryit for meit and drink. Quhilk in all haist to him richt sone was brocht And thairof dr?k blyithlie quhil he gude thocht In the meane time the smell persauit he Of his ?oung plant, and best belouit tre. To him he callis the Gardnair richt sone, And said mischant, quhat hes thow to me done? Weill I persaue my plant birne in the fire, Thairfoir at me thow hes not seruit thy hyre. He said my Lord, it is trew that ?e tell, Nane did that turne bot ?our awin wife hir sell. Than said the Knicht I wait that can not be. That my awin wife wald do sic thing to me, For weill scho knew that tre I lufit best, Be twentie fauld nor I did all the rest. I wait scho wald neuer consent thairtill, Becaus scho knew that it was not my will. Scho said gude Lord I cry ?ow heir mercie, For it was I that cuttit doun the trie. Knawing richt weill ?e war werie forgane, Cauld, waik &amp; tyrit, and gude fire had we nane And I did it ?our curage to refresche, To mak ?ow blyith, and to comfort ?our flesche That was the caus I gart this fire on mak, Onlie for ?ow, and for nane vthers saik. Quhen the Knicht hard it was the samin tre, Vnto his wife he said richt angerlie: O wickit wife how durst ?e be sa bald, To cut the tre, that I in na wayis wald Sene bene cut doun for greit riches and rent, I mak ane vow ?e sall it sair repent. And knawing weill, I lude it all the best, Ze haue me maid ane fault richt manifest. Quhen that scho saw hir husband discontent, Than scho began to weip and als lament. On fen?eit sort hir self for to excuse, At siclike time as wemen oft times dois, Schir I did it for ?our vtilitie, And ?e it takis agane ouir crabitlie. For I beleuit to win thairthrow gude deid And now I get greit magrie to my meid For it that I do euer for the best Ane reuin rewaird I get ay reddyest. I had rather be brint intill ane coill Nor for gude minde sic outrage for to thoill. Than scho began to weip and mak murning, Incontinent the Knicht that persauing, And sa at schort was mouit with mercie, And said my Ioy, ?our murning now lat be. In time c?ming se that ?e not me mufe To displesure nor hurt the thing I lufe. Thairfoir be war, the dayis of ?our lifetime, That neuer agane ?e commit sic a crime. As for this time heir I forgiue ?ow clene, Ceis weip na mair, be still and dry ?our Ene. Than the nixt day to Kirk scho went agane, Met hir mother, quhome of scho was richt fane, Gude morne mother (quod scho) w? hart &amp; breist Now weill aneuch faith I may lufe the Preist. And I haue done euin as ?e counsallit me, My handis cut doun his best belouit tre, Sa ?our counsall I did intill all thing, Bot fra he saw that I maid sic murning He chereist me, and hes forgeuin me quyte, Thairfoir Mother put me not in the wyte Howbeit I lufe the Preist with all my hart, For my gude man he keipis me not a part. The Mother said thocht auld men anis forgeif, In time c?ming efter and ?e thame greif: Thay will trewlie pans the nixt fault agane, And puneis it perchance with dowbill pane. My counsall is temp him ane vther tyde, Allace Mother (quod scho) I may not byde. For I suffer mair pane for ?one same Preist, Nor I can schaw or think into my breist. Aperdone me my sweit Mother thairfoir, Of ?our counsall now I will tak no moir. The Mother said, for the lufe thow suld haue To me, becaus my Cors did the consaue: Of my bosum, as ane Bab did the beir, And for the blyssing of thy Father deir: In this behalf ?it temp him anis agane, Gif ?e get quyte than I forgiue ?ow plane, To lufe the Preist, or ony that ?e pleis, Scho said that taill to me dois greit diseis, Fra my plesure for to remaine sa lang, Forsuith Mother ?e ar sa far in the wrang. Neuertheles for my Fatheris blyssing Zit anis agane I sall giue him temping. How it sall be, first ?e mon to me schaw, All the fassoun I pray ?ow lat me knaw. Zour husband hes (quod scho) ane litill hound He will not cois for mony merk and pound, He lufis sa weill, that nichtlie in his bed, He makis his couche, and with fine meit is fed With his awin hands, se ?e the same hound keil Befoir his Ene, sa ?e may wit richt weill This being done, be ?e not puneist than, Go lufe the Preist, or ony vther man I gif ?ow leif, I sal ?ow neuer blame, Sa it be not to ?our greit sin and schame. Scho said Mother I will ?our counsall do At this present, quhat ?e will charge me to. For thair is not ane barne I wait leuand, Sa faine wald keip of my eild the command Of hir parents, and now withouttin skaith, I will obtene the blyssing of ?ow baith. And now Mother remember in ?our thocht For ?our blyssing I did ellis wald I nocht. And than scho said my sweit Mother adew, Quhat thocht I haue I pray God gif ?e knew. Than come scho hame and put of as scho micht That langsum day, quhill it come to the nicht. And sa at euin commandit that hir bed, With purpour clais and silk suld be ouir spred. Quhilk the seruandis at hir command hes done With coistlie clais the bed thay spred it sone. And quhen the bed was this at reddy maid, The litill hound thairon hes him doun laid. As his custome was and conswetude, Als the gude wife knew weill that he wald dude And vp scho rais with minde malitious, With haitrent hart and vult richt venemous. Be the hind heillis this hound than did scho tak And all his harnis out on the wall scho straik. Sayand quhat deuill dois this tyke on our bed, That is sa riche and all with silks ouirspred. Quhen the Knicht saw his litil ho?d was slane Fra crabitnes na way he culd refrane. Bot till his wife with angrie hart can say, Wickit woman out of my sicht away: How culd thow find into thy cruell minde, To sla the hound that to me was sa kinde? And ouir all hounds w? my awin hart was lufit O wickit wife Mahoun thy hart hes mufit, To do sic thing, and me to Ire Incres, O curst catiue wo to thy cruelnes. Scho said gude man haue ?e not richt weil sene How this foull tyke with his feit sa vnclene Vpon our bed hes lyne and fylit the same Haue ?e plesure thairof or ony game, Foull traikit tykis vpon our bed to ly, Thocht ?e pleis sa, the same ?it pleis not I, To spill our bed that is sa precious, Couerit with clais sa clene and curious. With his foull feit cum new furth of the myre, I rather haue brint the bed and all in fyre. Than said the Knicht with ane angrie visage, Knew thow not weill, that I had greit curage Into ane Leische my hound for to se led, Ane hunder times, nor lying in my bed. I rather geuin all my hors quhair thay stand Or ?e had tane sic wickit deid in hand. Than quhen scho saw the Knicht sa discontent, And in sum part raisit in matalent: To weip and rair in all haist scho began, Sayand allace that euer I knew ane man. For quhen I was into my virgine flouris I knew nathing of thair schairp winter schouris For ony tyke in this wise to be schorit, Quicke in my graue I had rather be smorit. For all that I for the best dois pretend, Ze ay alledge that I thairin offend. Howbeit my minde be euer trew and gude I get na thank, this schortlie I conclude. Than this auld knicht persauing the greit cair Weiping, murning, with reuthfull hart &amp; sair As he beleuit, he said lat be sic thing, And at this time ?e mak na mair murning, I pardone ?ow, vnder protestatioun In time c?ming ?e mak na occasioun, Me for to mufe to anger or to Ire, For gif ?e do, at sum time I will tyre. Ze knaw richt weill ?e cuttit doun the tre, And now at schort my hound ?e haue gart die. Do not siclike I hartlie ?ow requeir, For gif ?e do, na mair I can forbeir To puneis ?ow, for all that is gane by To the vtrest remember weill sall I. Thairfoir be war mak me not discontent At ?ow na mair, and sa to bed thay went. Sa on the morne at time vp sone scho rais With mirrie minde, and put on all hir clais. Went to the Kirk, and sa hir Mother met Beleuing weill of hir gude leif to get: To lufe the Preist, and fyld hir husbandis bed, Bot as God wald sic thing was na thing sped Thay hailsit vther as thay thocht best be done, And in talking togidder thay fell sone. Scho said Mother ouir lang for ?our requeist, I haue the lufe forletit of the Preist. For now I haue temptit my husband twyis Hangit be I quhen that I tempt him thryis, Be ?our counsall ane greit thing I haue done, By my consait mony stages abone. For as ?e bad I cuttit doun his trie, And now laitlie I gart his gude hound die. And baith thir faultis he hes forgeuin me quyte In time c?ming to me ?e put na wyte. With all my minde and hart within my breist, In all gude haist I will ga lufe the Preist. The Mother said I pray the douchter deir, With patience twa wordis thow wald me heir It is weill knawin with ma nor I can tell. That ay auld men ar sle and cruell, And will think on vpon faultis done befoir, Howbeit sum time thay wil not chyde nor schoir For it is said, and als richt weill I wait, That crueltie it is appropriat To eldering Knichtis y? in ?outh hes bene kene, Sine in thair eild thay turne to tray and tene. And for sum fault will puneis with rigour, As thay in minde it takis in displesour. Zit my counsall thairfoir I wald thow did, And thairefter I sall the not forbid: Lufe quhome thow list, or quhome y? lykis to lufe Thair is my hand I sall the not reprufe. Zit temp him anis as we can best deuise. For it is said that all things thryfis bot thrise. Scho said Mother I heir ?ow talk in vane Knew ?e the thocht and nichtlie burning pane, That I suffer continuallie in hart, I wait ?e wald not tak my contrapart. Ze ar Mother ane woman as I am, Quhat wald ?e say gif ?e wantit the game Of my Father, that ?e richtlie bruik, For ane new lufe but dout sone ?e wald luik. With all ?our pith the same ?e wald purches, And haist the same with all ?our besines. Into this cace now put ?our minde to rest, To lufe the Preist gude faith I think it best. Scho said dochter for the greit pane and cure I had of the, that time quhen I the bure. And for the fude thairof quhilk that the fed, I the beseik fyle not thy husbandis bed. Till the thrid time, I pray the him to prufe, As thow will haue my blissing and my lufe. Deny me not this sober small petitioun, And I promeis to the ane sure conditioun. I sall furth set and further thy Intent, To thy plesure, and als Intandement. And neuer say that thow hes done ane mis, My sweit dochter I pray the grant me this. As thow will haue my blissing on thy banis, My small desire I pray the grant me anis. The dochter said, Mother I ?ow declair, The mater is to me sa sad and sair, That I may not sa lang abstene thairfra, Zit not the les sa Inwartlie ?e pra: For the greit charge first that ?e say to me, And sine agane ?e haue promeist trewlie Into this cace to further furth my caus, Gif I had neid the richteous God it knawis Thairfoir schaw me the maner and the way, How I sall temp him to the thrid effray. The Mother said on Sonday nixt c?mand I knaw richt weill the minde of ?our husband. To haue vs all to dine is his Intent, With mony freindis, that nane be thair absent, With diuers ma gude men of this Cietie, Than quhen ?e ar all at ?our Maiestie, With all ?our meitis weill seruit at the Tabill At the burde heid to sit ?e ar richt abill. Ane key ?e sall into the buirdclaith knit, Quhilk at ?our belt dois hing, not latting wit That ?e did sa, bot as it come on chance Saying furth plane with ane fair countenance, Ze may persaue sa for?etfull ane wife, As I am now I traist be not on life. In my Chalmer my knife I haue for?et, Force I mon rise, the same agane to get. Than sall ?e rise with ane faird haistelie, Na man knawing quhair that ?e knit ?our kie. Sa it being knit into the buirdclaith fast, Than sall ?e all the meit and tabill doun cast. On this fassoun all ?our meit salbe spilt With displesure, and all ?our Naiprie gilt. Ze doing sa, vnpuneist gif ?e be, To lufe the Preist, faith heir I mak ?ow fre. Scho said for anis ?our counsall sall I preif, Bot neuer agane, sa lang as I may leif. For ?our counsall I haue done far ouir micht, And sa ather at vther tuke gude nicht. Within few dayis the Feist was preparit Aboundantlie and for na coist thay sparit, The Father, Mother, and freindis of honestie, On euerie side war callit thair to be. The Tabill couerit, and all set doun to dine, The meitis come, richt delicate with wine. All being set, as it culd best effeir The gude wife cryit Ilk man to mak gude cheir At the buird heid scho sat hir awin self doun, Hir Mother weill persauit the fassoun. Quhat hir dochter wald do richt weill scho knew Beleuing weill the same thing scho wald rew. Sa the gude wife ane bonie lytill kie Hang at hir belt scho knit richt quyetlie. That nane persauit, nor knew hir fals Intent, Bot this scho said to all the burde present. Gif I be wise, now ?e may all persaue, In my Chalmer my knife for?et I haue. Quhilk I mon fetche, &amp; with ane faird vprais, And with ane tit tuik with hir the buird clais. The Tabill turnit, and all the meit doun flang Allace scho said faith now I haue done wrang I sair repent, that I sa schortlie rais The meit is spilt, and fylit ar all clais. The Knicht changeit countenance in his face, And smylit for scorne that sa occurrit the cace. And sufferit ouir with blyith dissimulance. To treit his gaistis with ane gude countenance And commandit ane new Tabill be set With new Naiprie, and vther coursis get. And prayit his gaistis for to be blyith and glaid Howbeit his Tabill was reckleslie doun laid. Incontinent fresche meitis was brocht anone, To new denner with blyithnes ar thay gone. For all thing done not mufing him nathing, Nor to his wife ane Ill word not saying. Making gude cheir to all the companie, With mirrynes welc?mand thame glaidlie. Bot the Mother knawing weill the Intent, Of the dochter, was wonder discontent. The denner done, thay thankit all the Knicht And als his wife, &amp; bad thame baith gude nicht On the nixt morne the Knicht airlie he rais, In name of God, first to the Kirk he gais. And efter he had his deuotioun done, To ane Barbour but tarie past he sone. Saying Maister ar ?e gudlie expart, In blude latting, or Insicht in that Art? He said gude Schir I am expart trewlie Of euerie vaine within a mannis bodie, I knaw richt weill, or ?it in ane woman, In drawing blude thairof greit craft I can. Than said the Knicht thairof I am content, Cum on with me and ?e sall haue payment. Sa the Barbour hame with the Knicht he w?t, And be the gait he tauld him his Intent. And sa thay come vnto the Knichtis ludgeing, Quhair his wife lay, sone thay gat entering. He said gude dame get vp for ?e mon rise, Quod scho gude Schir, forsuith its not the gise Sa sone to rise, say ?e that for ane mock? It is scarce ?it nyne houris gane of the clock. Th? said ?e Knicht dame rise for ?our awin gude On baith the armes ?e mon be lattin blude. Scho said gude Schir sen my Mother me bair Blude vpon me was lattin neuer mair. And now thairof sen I want conswetude, I haue na will for to be lattin blude. Than said the Knicht, forsuith ?e ar the war, To lat ?ow blude sa long that ?e defar. Think ?e not on quhat faultis ?e haue maid me First ?e hewit doun my Nobill plant and tre. Quhilk ?e knew weill that I lude all the best, And sine ?e knaw how that my hound ?e drest. And ?isterday ?our freindis being present, At the Tabill sa cruellie me schent. Gif I suffer that ?e do the fourt wrang, In conswetude and vse sa ?e sall gang. Within schort time ?e sall me sa constrane, To vtter schame, that I can noe refrane: My self fra schame, without I find remeid, And I find weill sum fault is in ?our heid: Of corrupt blude, that mon be lattin out, And als wilde blude in ?our bodie but dout. That fra thine furth ?e sall na mair beir blame Nor anger me, nor ?it put me to schame. He causit seruandis but ony mair abaid In the Chalmer ane greit fire to be maid. Scho seing that scho trowit without remeid Into that fire for to be brint to deid. Th? cryit scho loud for Gods saik grant mercie And I promit ?ow a thing faithfullie. In all my dayis I sall ?ow neuer greif, Sa this ane time that ?e will me releif. And haue pietie, I grant I did trespas, Thairfoir gude Schir mercie at ?ow I as. Than said the Knicht be him that mercie maid Streich ?e not furth ?our arme but mair abaid: Quhair I intend but of ?our blude haue part, I sall haue all the hart blude at ?our hart. To the Barbour also he said in plane, Se that ?e cut ane greit hoill in the vane. Or by Sanct George the same thing ?e sall haue For ?our rewaird, that scho suld now ressaue. The Barbour seeing he gat sa sair ane charge, He maid ane wo?d, that was baith deip &amp; large On that ane arme, quhill that the blude ran do? Aboundantlie, and with greit effusioun. Quhilk for to stanche the Knicht wald nathing thoil Bot rather bad mak mair larger the hoill Vnto the time he saw hir change cullour, That wound to stanche he causit the Barbour And bad him strike into that vther arme, Als grit ane wo?d, quhairof he thocht na harme. Scho said husband haue mercie now on me, I am sa waik, I traist schortlie to die. Th? said the Knicht ?e suld haue thocht on this Anis, twise, thrise, quhen ?e committit mis. Quhilk causis me richt sair aganis my will, Of ?our wilde blude sa mekill to se spill, For I sure ?ow he leuis not vpon life, That wald haue drawin sa muche blude on my wife Except my self thairto had geuin consent, But dout that ane of vs suld sair repent. Bot at this time ?our awin licht wilfulnes, Hes causit me on this maner ?ow dres. For ?e haue done sic wickit turnis thre, Quhairfoir but dout that puneist ?e mon be. Than the Barbour causit hir lay furth on breid That vther arme, that he micht caus hir bleid. And then he straik vpon that vther side Into hir arme ane wound baith deip and braid Quhill that the blude aboundantlie ran doun, That all beleuit that scho suld fall in swoun. With ane waik voice scho cryit richt pieteouslie My sweit husband haue mercie now on me. For I beleue becaus I am ?our wife Ze couet not that I suld lois the life. Than said the Knicht to the Barbour agane I think it best that now ?e stanche ?one vane Now presentlie, na mair ?e lat it bleid, The Barbour said, sa sall I Schir in deid. That being done, the Knicht he gaue command To his seruandis, that thay suld sone fra hand Put hir in bed that scho micht get sum rest, The Barbour said gude Schir I think that best. Than bad his wife remember in hir minde, In time bygane sa Ill scho was Inclinde. And mis amend, or I hecht be the Rude, Do ?e not sa, I sall se ?our hart blude. Than the Barbour at this gude eldering knicht Ressauit his wage, and at him tuik gude nicht. Than the seruandis in minde thay thocht it best Thair awin husie to put hir to sum rest. Sa in hir bed thay happit hir esilie, Quhen thay beleuit nathing bot hir to die. Scho being laid sa softlie in hir bed, Heuie at hart, richt faint and all forbled. Ane damisell scho bad into all haist, Fetche hir Mother or scho ?eildit the Gaist. Quha in all haist that to hir Mother tald Zour dochter the spreit scho will vp?ald. And cum ?e not, I say to ?ow trewlie, Scho is sa faint, we trow all scho sall die. Than the Mother Inquyrit secreitlie Quhat was the caus of hir Infirmitie. The damisell to hir the fassoun said, Quhairof y? Mother was wonder blyith &amp; glaid That hir dochter sa trimlie was correctit, Howbeit that scho the samin not suspectit. Sa on scho come vnto hir dochters place, To considder the fassoun and the cace. And als sone as scho hard hir Mother speik, My sweit Mother (said scho) I ?ow beseik, To set ?ow doun and rest at my bed heid, For I beleue na thing bot onlie deid. Of my bodie so muche blude I haue bled, That I on force behuifit to tak bed. Throw verie fault of febilnes of blude, That of my life I trow to be denude. The Mother said, my sweit dochter and deir, Tauld I ?ow not ane word was not in weir: That ay auld men was schairp bitter and fell, Richt outrageous, dispitefull and cruell. Howbeit sum time a fault thay wald ouirse. Zit at the last thay wald it puneis hie. My dochter now ane questioun I will speir, Howbeit ?e be richt waik now lyand heir. Tell me the treuth and oppin to me ?our breist, In time c?ming gif ?e will lufe the Preist. Quha said agane, allace Mother lat be, Ane warldis schame mot tak all Preistis for me The heich vengeance of the greit God abufe, Mot quell thame all or I ane of thame lufe. Bot my husband that is baith deir and sweit, Thair is na man in warld for me sa meit. The Mother said, quhy suld ?e haue dispite At the pure Preist or giue him ony wite: For I beleue ?our minde he neuer knew, Nor in sic cace he did ?ow not persew. But weill I knaw quhat thing y? gart ?ow dude, The wantones and aboundance of blude. Quhilk I beleue at this time now ?e want, For ?e behude haue sum thing ?ow to dant. Mother (said scho) I pray ?ow let me rest, Abone all men my husband I think best. The Maister said than to the Empreour, Schir haue ?e tane this taill weill in ordour: And considerit thairof the morall sence, The Empreour said Maister be my conscience It is the best and wonder lefull taill That I haue hard this mony ?eir but faill. To hir husband scho did schrewde turnis thre, First scho cuttit his nobill tender tre: Sine slew his ho?d quhilk was bot a dum beist And than thridlie misfassonit all the Feist. Gif he had thoillit the fourt for to bene done, It suld haue brocht him to confusioun sone. The Maister said I counsall ?ow heirfoir, Tent to ?our wife, gif hir credence no moir. Sla ?e ?our sone (for hir wordis) vnoffendit Ze sall forthink quhen ?e can not amend it. The Empreour said, I say to ?ow trewlie, My sone this day for ?our saik sall not die. The Maister said, I thank ?our Nobill grace, That for my saik hes pardonit him sic space. Sa tuik his leif, as culd him weill effeir, And sa hamewart to his awin hous culd speir. Or we proceid now to the Emprice taill Sum we will talk of the Doctouris but faill. Moralitas. Ze may persaue now be this taill Gude counsall is of greit auaill Quha that will tak it weill in heid Fra vice to vertew it sall him leid And ay be reulit with ane gude reid, This is forsuith but faill. Gude counsall is ane precious thing Outher to Empreour or King It lattis all thing for to ga wrang The King nor Empreour neuer rang And gif thay want gude counsall lang With reule thay sall not ring. All greit perrellis it settis on syde With wisdome it dois all prouyde, God it grantis to all degreis Bot mony sa fast fra it fleis Quhill thay be set vpon thair kneis Thay haue na grace to gyde. This ?oung woman had sair offendit Gif hir Mother had condiscendit To hir dochteris vnwise consait, In hir contrair scho maid debait And gart it gang ane vther gait Gude counsall sa defendit. The Mother was greit till allow, That causit hir dochter till hir bow, Throw gude counsall anis, twyse and thryse, Saying dochter and thow be wyse Tak not in hand sic Interpryse Except thow it auow. And sa be counsall of hir Dame Scho continewit hir glaikit game Howbeit scho rang in rampand rage, Gude counsall causit hir to asswage Quhill that the Barbour for his wage Maid hir meik as a Lam. Say ?e not bot it was despyte First cut the tre, the hound to smyte, Syne cast the Tabill sa rekleslie How can scho weill excusit be Scho was wyteles a lytill we Wantones had the wyte. And heit of blude was aboundant, Quhairof sum part scho micht weill want Hir husband than tuik weill in heid How he suld thairof get remeid Quhair hir blude was he laid cauld leid, And this way culd hir dant. Sa quhen the Mother come to se Quhidder gif scho wald leif or die Quha said dochter for my requeist Now lay thy hand to thy awin breist And se gif thow will lufe the Preist Ceis Mother lat that be. For had not bene ?our gude counsell But recure I had schamit my sell, And as ?e ken I was richt thra For all ?our sawis to cum thairfra, Now thankis to God it is not sa, Gude counsell beiris the bell. The Preist of all this was wyteles Of my baudrie and brukilnes For he thairof neuer thing knew Nor I to him sic thing not schew Bot was in purpois to persew Thairfoir he was saikles. ?oung wemen heirfoir in ?our flouris Thocht ?e think pryde of Paramouris Tak heir exampill how I am, And set on syde sic sawreles game Or ?e sall sair repent the same The tyme was myne as ?ouris. ?e auld men that ar cum to age ?oung wemen into Mariage In na maner is for ?ow meit Thay are wantoun and full of heit To ?ow is sour that thay think sweit And skant to get for wage. Thairfoir in tyme ?e suld correct thame With aw and laubour ?e suld brek thame Let thame not braull on euerie bink. For as ?e brew sa sall ?e drink Perchance haue mater to forthink And greit caus to suspect thame. To this talking ?e suld tak tent Or efterwart ?e sall repent Quhen ?e ar maid Iohne Thomsounis man Than sall ?e braull, than sall ?e ban And quhen remeid nane find ?e can Bot all with schame ouirschent. Now ?e ar warnit, I bid adew We ar ouir gude quhair we ar trew, Thair is ouir few is faithfull found Sum cuttis the tre, some killis the hound, Sum castis the Tabill to the ground As I did, that I rew. Ane praise to the fourt Doctour. Lavde, honour, praise, and thankis ane hunder fald To the Doctour for the Taill thow hes tald, That sauit hes the Chyldis lyfe for ane day, And quenched hes the Empreouris boist sa bald In greit malice, quha that but mercie wald His awin sone slaine, bot thow him causit say nay Thocht zone quick Feind dois all that euer scho may To haue him slaine, bot we sall all defy hir Within few dayis on reid weir we sall cry hir. The Fyft Taill of the Emprice. The Emprice heiring y? child ?it was not deid Ane new consiat than tuik scho in hir heid, Throw all the toun gart fle in alkin artis The carage hors yat wald draw wanis &amp; cartis And fillit the same with alkin kinde of geir, Hir Ornamentis and clais that scho suld weir. Maid hir to pas vnto hir Father hame, Saying scho wald na langer thoill sic schame. As scho did daylie that all men micht se, And thairupon culd not reuengeit be. Quhairfoir scho wald at hir father seik mendis Quhome on scho said all hir hope clene dependis The seruandis sa persauing hir Intent To the Empreour thay schew Incontinent. Quha past to hir in haist but mair proces Inquirit the caus of all sic besines. Quhair mark ?e to, or quhidder will ?e go Quhat is the caus that ?e ar muifit so? Scho sayis I will but ony mair delay, To my Father the hie gait mak the way. Quhair I may haue baith solace mirth &amp; game Bot now I haue the contrair of the same. Thairfoir I mon persew quhair I may get it, For at this time ?e gar me quyte for?et it. The Empreour said will ?e get mair solace Nor bide with me, I trow into na place. For I had hope thair was na man on life Was better lude nor I with his awin wife. Now I persaue the verray clene contrair, That bownis away in vther place to fair. Scho said my Lord, for that caus I depart For I lufe ?ow with sa perfite ane hart, That I rather of ?our deith to heir tell, Nor be present, and for to se it my sell. Of ?our Maisteris ?e tak far mair delite, To heir thair taillis all tauld in my despite: That I am quite put furth of ?our credence Ze gif to thame sa Inwart attendance. Thairfoir it sall chance ?ow or all be gane Far worse nor did vnto Octauiane, Quhilk this Impire as ?e now presentlie Had for to gyde, and deit in miserie. He was sa fals, and als sa couetous, That his subiectis held him as odious. Thay war constranit for his greit falsitie To eird him quick for all his dignitie, Becaus Ilk man sa couetous did him hold, Thay ?et his mouth full of het meltit gold. To quhome (quod he) let not sic thing be said, That of falset the blame to me be laid. Scho said but dout the blame lyis all in ?ow, For day be day all time ?e gar me trow Zour Sone suld die, and ?it he leuand is, And weill ?e knaw that he did me greit mis. Thairfoir beleue that farther mair from hence, In that behalf I giue ?ow na credence. The Empreour said it bec?mis not ane King, Without counsall to discus euerie thing. And in speciall for to giue Iudgement On my awin sone without gude auisement. Thairfoir Madame I pray ?ow hartfullie, That ?e wald schaw sum gude exampill to me: Quhairthrow I may my realme with wisdome gyde And to my self ane esie life prouyde. Scho said I sall ane storie to ?ow schaw, Quhairby ?e may weill and perfitelie knaw To reule ?our Realme, and hald ?our self perfite Sa ?e will mak ?ow of the seuin Maisteris quite Of thair counsall ?e ar ouir couetous And of thair taillis ?e ar ouir desirous. Zit not the les my taill furth sall I say, And gif ?e pleis the sentence beir away. Befoir our dayis thair was baith hard &amp; sene Kingis, Empreouris into this toun hes bene Amang the rest I remember on ane Quhilk callit was to Name Octauiane. Sa couetous as he was to win gold, I neuer red ane formit on the mold. The Cieti?anis that time as I hard say Thay had greit weiris with all about th? lay, And all Natiounis richt cruellie thay dantit, Quhair thay tribute or ony manrent wantit. Quhill that it come to sic het point of weir. That all Natiounis in thair contrair did steir. In that meane time yair was ane maister Clark Dwelling in Rome, richt cunning in his wark. Callit Virgill, the quhilk in Arsmetrik, He was sa sle, that nane was found him lik. The Cieti?anis this Clark thay did require, That he wald wirk, &amp; win fra thame gude hire To finde sum way be his craft and cunning For to Ingraue sum Image or sic thing, Of his pretik, Ingine or Industrie, Subtell science, or ?it Nycromansie. Quhairby y? thay micht haue perfite knawlege, Quhen Enemeis to weirfair maid veyage: And to eschew fra all aduersitie, And seik fordwart thair awin prosperitie. Quhairby thay micht prouyde thair puruey?ce For gude or euill quhidder that it did chance. The Cieti?ans than with this cunning Clark Maid ane accord, and sa fell to his wark. Within the toun he buyldit vp ane Towre, Of ane greit hicht, and als of greit valour, And set vpon the samin Towris heid, Greit Images of Irne, Tin, bras and Leid. To the number be thair awin discriptiounis, As thair was than in all the warld of Regio?is In the middis of that samin Towre of hicht, Ane greit Image he set to all mannis sicht. And in the hand it bure ane goldin ball, As it suld bene the Maister of thame all. And Ilk ane had of the rest be thame sell, Into thair hand ane lytill ringand bell, And turnit thair face to the same Regioun, To thame assignit, and tuik dominioun. Gif ony Realme or Regioun vp wald rise, In contrair Rome, or rebell ony wise. Than that Image to ony Ilk Regioun, It had respect, or ?it dominioun Wald mufe the face, and also ring the bell, And thame to warne it wald not faill to tell Than the Romanis or ony fais wist, That rebellioun rais for to resist. And armour them into all faitis of weir, As thame become, or to thame culd effeir. And sa small land thair was in Christindome Bot be that way was maid subiect to Rome. Quhairthrow yai w? greit worschip &amp; honours Ouir all the warld thay war callit conquerours This being done this nobill cunning Clark, In Romes toun he maid ane vther wark. Quhilk was ane fire continuallie burning, Baith nicht and day, and neuer had slokning. To the pepill being ane greit comfort, Solace and mirth, blyithnes and mekill sport. Twa bathing fattis he maid within the toun, To commountie greit consolatioun. The ane was cauld, preparit for simmer sessoun The vther het, for winter quhilk was ressoun. Gif ony man his bodie wald refresche, Pas to that ane, thairwith he micht him wesche Betuix thir Bathis, and this continuall licht, Ane Image maid of greit stature and hicht. With sic Ingine, sa lang as thair it stude The fire suld birne, and ay the Bathis do gude. In quhais foirheid was writin with letters fine Quha strykis me doun greit treasure sal yai tine And mair atouir it may fall sic ane chance, Quhen yai haue done to tak ane greit venge?ce This Image was maid with sic craftines, Till that it stude, and thoilland na distres. The fire lestit, and neuer mair ?eid out, The baths twa stude in yair awin ply but dout Quhill at the last ane cunning Clerk come by, And this Image perfitelie culd espy. The wryting red, and to him self he said, Quhat kin vengeance can on ane man be laid. Or quhat treasure may ony man now tine? That strykis the doun, or puttis the to ruine. Bot I beleue rather hid for to be, Vnder thy feit sum greit sowmes of monie. Sum riche Iowellis of gold or sum treasour, That thow art sa set vp with sic honour. This I beleue, and is the liklyest, And sa at schort this Image doun he kest, To that effect sum treasure to obtene, Bot nane he gat, becaus nane thair had bene. Bot sa sone as that Image fell but dout, Incontinent the fire was quenchit out. The Baths twa was vanischit out of sicht, Did neuer gude, nor efter had na micht. The pure pepill heirof was wonder sorie, That thay war sa destitute of sic glorie. Baith of thair Baths, and of thair lestand licht Quhilk to thame did greit comfort day &amp; nicht Sayand Ilk ane with loude voice to the air, Curst mot he be for now and euer mair, That vs sa quyte of comfort hes maid clene, That we sa lang in conswetude hes bene. For his plesure and profeit singulair, Wo be to him with sturt and mekill cair. Zit not the les thair treasure gat he none, And our plesures all quyte away is gone. In this meane time was leuand Kingis thre, To quhome Romanis had done greit vilanie, Be greit murther and malice thame molest, With cruell weiris, and slauchter thame opprest On quhome thay wald richt fane reu?geit bene Sa to counsall thir thre Kingis did conuene. With yair Barro?s, yair Lords &amp; yair knichts And vthers men of greit wisdome and michts. How that thay micht on Rome reuengeit be, For thair slauchter and thair greit vilanie: Vnto thame done in diuers times went, And culd na way on thame get assythment. Quhen diuers dayis thay had at counsall bene Sum of thame said this auaillis not ane prene, Thair michtis is far abone all our puissance, Thairfoir we think sum vther conuoyance: We mon attempt, and new consaitis considder, Thairfoir lat all our wittis now ga togidder. Than four auld Knichtis y? was of co?sall gude Befoir thair King and Lordis vp thay stude, Saying thir wordis we think we wirk in vane, On this mater sa lang for to remaine. For treuth it is quhil yair greit towre vpstandis With Images and bellis into thair handis Quhilk warnis th? quhen ony Regio? will rise, In thair contrair, than pas thay to deuise Remeid thairfoir, quhat land aganis them steir[is] With all defence, and cruell fait of weiris. Sa we mon rin vpon ane vther burde, Eschew the deip, and cast vs to the furde. Than said the Kingis quhat think ?e best to do. Quod thay pleis ?e our counsall to stand to, Sa that ?e will thairon to mak the coist, We sall ?ow pleis, or ellis our heidis be loist. Than said the Kingis for coist se ?e not spair, Thairof ?e sall be answerit and far mair. Than said the Knichtis the mater standis thus Octauiane ?e knaw is couetous, And lufis gold ?e ken abone measure, Thairfoir he mon be blindit with treasure. The sicht of gold will gar him sa Inclinde, To all our sawis, he hes gold sa in minde. Pakkit richt weill four Punsiounis to the heid Ze mon furneis of cuin?eit gold sa reid. With gude conuoy and ordourlie expence, Quhill that we get the Empreouris presence. This being done, get ?e not ?our Intent We sall all four tine landis life and rent. The Kingis said, go to it sall be done, Thay maid fordwart, the gold was gottin sone Four full punsiounis of gold that was sa bricht To Romes toun thay brocht within the nicht. Na m? knawing quhat thair within was closit To thair purpois quhen yai th? thocht disposit Thir four Punsiounis into four sindrie artis In Romes toun thay hid at diuers partis. Sum in Fuseis, in draw wellis and in dykis, Laich in the eird, and sum thay sank in sykis. This being done, thay come in quyetlie, To thair hostage, and lay doun preuilie. And on the morne at time of day thay rais, With gude Intent, and to the Palice gais. And sa belyue as thay past vp the streit, It chancit thame the Empreour for to meit. Thay hailsit him with reuerence as effeirit, Agane at thame richt patientlie he speirit: From quh?ce thay come, or quhat seruice culd do To quhat science thay war maist abill to. Quha answerit him into thair best maneir, From far countreis to ?our grace c?min heir. We ar spa men, suithsayaris and deuinouris, To serue ?our grace, and als ?our counsallouris. And can discus all dreames sa cunninglie, And tell thairof the treuth and veritie. And all hid geir that is put out of sicht: We can it find, and thairto ga at richt. Be our awin dreames our craftis and Ingine, Thocht it war hid ane thousand ?eiris sine. And we haue hard that ?our grace hes plesure In sic behalfis, and thairon takis cure. And gif ?our grace at vs sic will require, We ar reddy to fulfill ?our desire. Be day or nicht into all kinde of sort. With hart and minde ?our grace for to comfort. The Empreour than considering in his minde, How thir four men to sic thingis was Inclinde And knew richt weill that into Romes Cietie Greit sowmes of gold was hid richt quietlie. Quhairof he culd get na perfite knawledge, Except sic men as thir he had in wage. Sa couetice and gredynes of geir, Haistie credence, quhilk all men suld forbeir. Blindit his thocht, and causit his wittis foruey Gart him ouir sone to thair bidding obey. And sa at schort the Empreour is aggreit, With thir four men, and faithfullie thame feit. Quhome to he said, gude schirs I wil ?ow prufe And gif ?e be sic men for my behufe As ?e haue said, ?e sall haue gude rewaird, Ilk ane of ?ow but dout sall be ane Laird, And Intreitit with thankis into my hous Amang my Lordis, with giftis glorious. Thay said agane and pleis ?our Maiestie Na mair rewaird at ?our grace couet we Bot the ane half of that we do obtene, Vnder the eird, as sall be cleirlie sene: Be our Ingine, our dreamis and our slichtis Within few ?eiris we mark to m?d ?our michtis The Empreour said go do as ?e deuise, Ze tak on hand ane honest Interprise. Than said thay all vnto the Empreour, This nicht my Lord gif it war ?our plesour: To the eldest of vs four to grant leif, His clene cunning the samin nicht to preif. Be his awin dreame quhat he can comprehend And quhat thairof sall be the finall end. And thairefter we sall in dayis thre, Schaw to ?our grace thairof the veritie. Quhat it betakins, and quhat thairof sall cum, To ?our plesure ?e sall knaw all and sum. The Empreour said, go to I am content, Sa tuik gude nicht, and all four furth yai went Merie in hart, richt wonder blyith and glaid, Sa gude answer that thay obtenit had. Past furth that time in scorne and derisioun, Beleuing weill the greit towre to get doun. Thre dayis and nichts being past and compleit Thir four kest them with the Empreour to meit The eldest said, and pleis ?our Nobill grace, To pas with vs, and we sall schaw the place Quhair that ane twn of reid gold lyis hid The Empreour said I will do as ?e bid. Than haistelie thay come vnto the place The eldest said and pleis ?our Nobill grace As I belue thair is of gold sa cleir, Ane twn streik full in this place lyand heir. Euin sa my dreame to me forsuith it schew, And I dout not bot we sall find it trew. Than thay all four to delf thay fell fra hand, And as he said, richt sa the gold thay fand, Quhilk gold befoir into the samin place Thame selfis had hid, ago bot ane schort space Zit not the les the Empreouris fantasie Trowit thay had found the gold in veritie. Quhilk quhen he saw, he was richt w?der glaid With mirrie cheir, and to thame four he said, Of this found gold the ane half ?e sall haue, The vther half I sall caus to ressaue. The nixt dreamer said to the Empreour, Now fallis to me, gif it be ?our plesour, My nicht about to dreame gif I can find, Ony mair gold, gif sum be left behind. The Empreour said god send ?ow sic further?ce As this Ilk day ?our brother gat throw chance The nixt nicht come, and siclike did the day, This nixt dreamer to the Empreour can say. Be of comfort, and gif it pleis ?our grace, This nicht I dreamit of mair gold in ane place Quhilk in schort time ?our nobil grace sal knaw And godwilling the same sall to ?ow schaw. And sa he did, quhairof he was richt blyith, Quhome to glaidlie thempreour said ful swyith Tak ?our awin part, and I sall tak the vther, For ?e haue done als weill as did ?our brother. Sa did the thrid on the samin Ilk wise, Alswa the fourt tuik the same Interprise. Ilk ane of thame fand to the Empreour Ane twn of gold, with riches and treasour. Thay causit the King to thame giue confidence As thay had found the gold be thair science Them selfis did hide that gold vnder the gro?d And causit all trow the same that yai had found The Empreour sa with gold he was begylit, And with thair slicht and science was ouirsylit. Notwithstanding the ane half he thame gaue Na wayis traisting that he suld thame dissaue. And quhen ather of thame had tane thair part The Empreour was richt Iocund in his hart. He thame auancit, and said yai war maist trew Of suithsayaris, that euer he ?it knew: And maist expart into thair awin science, That euer was, be his Intelligence. Thay persauing the Empreour was content Of thair doingis, thay said with ane consent, My Lord we haue Ilk ane our nicht about, Dreamit our dreames, quhilk ?e haue hard but dout Of verie treuth, and hes preuit in deid Zit farthermair will ?e thoill vs proceid, That we all four togidder dreame this nicht Sa sall our dreame haue the mair str?th &amp; micht We traist gif thair within this Cietie be Ony hid gold, greit Iowellis or monie, We sall it haue be our dreames and Ingine, Thocht it war hid ane thousand ?eiris sine. Quhairthrow ?our grace salbe enrichit w? gold, That ?our compair sall not be on the mold. And we dout not, bot richt weill vnderstandis That thair is gold ten thousand of thousandis Within the wallis hid of the same Cietie, Quhairof but dout gude knawledge get sall we. The Empreour said go to I am content, Sa that ?e find quhair thair is gold and rent. Thay tuik gude nicht all four and said adew Except th? selfis was nane thair mindes knew. Sa on the morne approching the nynt hour, Thay come all four befoir the Empreour, Quhome to thay said with gudlie countenance My Lord be blyith, for we haue gude tythance. For we all four hes dreamit this samin nicht Intill our sleip we haue sene sic ane sicht, Of birnand gold sa wonder greit plentie So muche at anis I trow few saw with Ee. Will ?e suffer the samin to be socht To ?our profeit but baid it sal be brocht. Than sall ?e haue of gold sic aboundance, That all the warld for gold sall ?ow auance. Of the greit Towre (quod thay) into the gro?d All this riches of gold is to be found. The Empreour said the greit God me defend, To sic ane wark that I neuer Intend. The michtie towre quhair y? the Image standis, For to put doun with ony mennis handis. Quhilk was buyldit be Clerkis sa bounteous, Sa done coistlie of sowmes sa sumpteous, Als warnis vs be thair small bellis ringing, Of enemeis gif thay be vprysing. Of all Regiounis outher be far or neir, Gif thay pretend aganis vs to mak weir. Thairfoir I can be na way giue consent, To steir that towre for ony gold or rent. Thay said my Lord haue ?e not found all trew, That we all four in ony sort ?ow schew. He said ?our wit and science I commend, And als ?our treuth surelie I will defend. Also ?our craft, ?our lawtie and honour, Bot I can not consent to tuitche the towre: Quhilk is to vs greit consolatioun, I will not thoill na way to put it doun. Thay said my Lord will ?e giue vs credence, With our awin handis, &amp; on our awin expence, We sall not faill to obtene the treasour, And in na sort thairby to hurt the towre, Nor Images, nor ?it the bellis that ringis, To saue all sic we can do sindrie thingis. We sall it do sa quyetlie in the nicht, Nane bot we four thairof sall get ane sicht. Gif it be done on daylicht patientlie, The pepill than suld cry out oppinlie, And rumour rise, out throw the haill Regioun, That ?e for gold suld tak the greit towre doun. We sall wirk sa that nouther ground nor towre Sall thoill distres or ?it tak displesour. The Empreour said quhen all folkis ar at rest, To find the gold go do as ?e think best. And I the morne sall cum and vesie ?ow, Quhat gold ?e get, and quhair ?e wirk &amp; how. Tak thair my Ring for ane takin expres Within the towre that ?e get glaid entres. Thir four come on at euin quhen it was lait, Vnto the towre thay mak the neirest gait. Callit the Capitane, the Ring vnto him schew, Quha said to them, the Ring richt weil he knew He them inquirit quhat was thair greit credence And thay him schew the haill taill and sentence. And sa at schort thir four fell to labour, To pyke and holk, and vndermine the Towre. Quhill it had nouther power, strenth nor micht Within thre dayis vnfallin to stand vp richt. This being done, on the third morne or day, Thay lap on hors, and priuelie staill away: To thair awin land with greit blyithnes &amp; Ioy That fand the cast that greit Towre to destroy, Bot or thay wan furth of sicht of the toun, Thay stude all four &amp; saw the towre fall doun. Sa on the morne quhen all folk did vp rise, Thay saw the towre was fallin on sic ane wise. The Senatouris thairof tuik discomfort, To the Empreour the fassoun culd report. And said gude Lord, how hes occurrit this cace That our greit Towre is fallin in sa schort space Quhilk daylie was our watche and comforting Contriar our fais, and maid vs ay warning. He answerit thame to me thair come four men, Quhilk of befoir I neuer did thame ken. And schew to me that thay war suithsayaris, Bot now I se that thay ar all greit dissaueris. And swoir for treuth, and also to me schew, Throw yair dreaming quhair gold was hid yai knew And gart me trow w?in the towris gro?d Ane thousand millio? of reid gold suld be found And not hurting the Towre nor ?it Image, To do the same I gaue thame gudelie wage. And sa to thame I gaue ouir greit credence Quhairthrow is fallin greit Inconuenience. Thay answerit him for ?our greit couatice, Zour gredynes and birnand auarice, And for ?our lufe to gold and greit delite, That ?e thairof had sic ane appetite. Sall we thairfoir be all destroyit at anis Nay, the first wraik sall fall vpon ?our banis. But mair proces to the Tolbuith him led, And on his bak thay kest him in ane bed, And powrit his mouth of meltit gold thair fow Saying to him tak the aneuch of it now. Thow couet gold with sa gredie desire, Thow hes vs tynt and all the haill Impire, Fulfill thy lust of gold quhilk thow sall haue. This being done, thay put him quick in graue, For gredynes of gold that was his end, Quhilk at his deid ane myte micht not him m?d Not lang efter come on thir Kingis thre, All in weirfair, with prepotent armie, Knawing richt weill the towre was cassin doun And sa thay laid ane greit seige to the toun, Quhilk thay ouircome, &amp; kest doun clene y? wall And sa at schort Rome was destroyit all. The Emprice said haue ?e tane weill my Lord Thir wordis in heid that I now did record, Thankis ?ow forsuith, thairfoir Madame said he For ?e haue tauld ane nobill taill to me. Than culd scho say this towre with the Image Betakins nocht bot thair awin personage. For luik sa lang as ?e leif in this life, Thair is na Kings that dar rais weir nor strife In ?our contrair, or ?it within ?our land, Sa lang as ?e is now on life leuand. And that ?our sone dois wonder weill considder With the counsall of his Maisters togidder. With thir fals taillis and fen?eit narratioun, How thay sall find the way to put ?ow doun. Ouir greit plesure to heir thame ay ?e haue, And thair minde is but dout ?ow to dissaue. As thir four men this Towre to ruine brocht, Thir Maisters sa wald bring ?ow euin to nocht And vndermine and cast ?ow vnder fute, This is the caus thay daylie to ?ow sute. The Images that sa greit money coist, Is ?our fyue wittis, quhilk thay beleue is loist. For sa barnelike and soft thay ?ow persaue, The haill Impire fra ?ow sa wald thay haue. The Empreour said that Ilk taill that ?e tell, I persaue weill may be tald be my sell. Thairfoir thay sall not mak of me the towre, Nor ?it change me as did that Empreour. All is falset that thay deill with I se, Thairfoir the morne my Sone sall hangit be. The Emprice said, will ?e ?our Sone gar hang ?e salbe blyith, fair weill and als leif lang, Sa the nixt day the Empreour gaue command, To tak his Sone and hang him vp fra hand. To the Gallous as thay war him leidand, The Fyft Maister come furth the way rydand. To the Palice he raid hard at the poist, For feir and dreid that the Childe suld be loist. Quha come lawlie befoir the Empreour And on his kneis him hailsit with honour. Quha wryit his face, and wald not on him luik Bot at him greit Indignatioun tuik. My Lord he said it is not ?our honour, My pure hailsing to tak in displesour. Thy c?ming heir (quod he) I couet nocht, Nor thy hailsing, nor nane that heir it brocht. For ?e haue seruit at my hand all to die, For displesure that ?e haue done to me. He said my Lord I neuer did the deid Vnto ?our grace, to get sic to my meid. As for ?our Sone, quhair ?e say he is dum We reckin that vnto ?our greit wisdome. As ?e will se heirefter in few dayis, As to ?our wife quhair ?e allege and sayis: Be hir sayingis that he wald hir eschamit, But dout thairof he aw not to be blamit For weill I wait thairof he is wyteles, As is my self, and of the same saikles. Thairfoir my Lord sic thing beleue ?e nocht, For the contrair to licht it sall be brocht, For ?our Sone is to vertew sa Inclinde, I wait sic vice was neuer in his minde. And gif ?e will for ?our wifes wilfull sawis, Vndo ?our Sone without proces of Lawis. It salbe worse to ?ow nor euer was To the Doctour and cunning Ypocras. That causit sla the Doctour Galiene, His Cousing deir, Maister of Medicine. The Empreour said, Maister tell me that taill Perchance it may for ?our cunning auaill. The Maister said, gar call ?our Sone agane, And all the suith I sall schaw ?ow in plane. Vnto ?our grace gif I tald my narratioun, In the meane time ?our sone suld suffer passioun. The Empreour than he causit his seruands pas And put his sone in presoun quhair he was. And sa that day he chaipit fra the Gallous, The Maister th? tald furth his tail as followis The Maisteris taill or we speik farthermair, The Quenis taill sum thing we mon declair. Moralitas. Say ?e not bot this Nobill Quene That ay befoir sa gude hes bene Callit hir Lord fals befoir his Ene, said oppinlie That he of falset was not clene, reid ?e and se. In the beginning of hir last Taill Quhair he suld haue the honour haill Iudge ?e gif scho did till him faill, in hir langage To call hir King sa vyle ane thing, with greit outrage. Bot wemen hes sic conditioun, Quhen thay ar noyit to want ressoun Thay spout than like ane Scorpioun by ordour clene Becaus quyte gane is discretioun, as did this Quene. Alswa the Empreour far did faill Sum hid conditioun of small auaill Quhilk that he maid be his counsaill, to thair consent Forsuith ane King suld wirk nathing, but auisement. Sa was sene of the casting doun Of the greit towre of Romes toun Quhair he maid preuie compactioun, that nane did knaw With vncouth men of strange Natioun, as deid did schaw. ?e Lordis and Lairdis of greit honour Do not as did this Empreour Put all his hope into treasour, and greit riches And loist his lyfe within ane hour, for gredynes. His gredynes sa weill was kend It walkit to the warldis end His fais quhome to he did offend, gat wit expres How his plesour was in treasour, and gredynes. Belyue thay fand ane quick Ingine Send him ane subtell hid propine Quhilk causit him his honour tine, in schort proces And put all Rome to greit ruine, for gredynes. For strangeris come with thair vaine wind And fals flatterie maid him sa blind, Sic gold and treasure thay suld find, throw subtelnes That thay sa said he was richt glaid, for gredynes. Thay schew him thay had sic science In dreaming sic experience Of gold to get sic confluence, be besines Bot he gaue ouir haistie credence, for gredynes. Quhilk causis greit mischeif to be As we may weill persaue and se Gettis maist credence quha best can lie, throw wickitnes Of half ane taill thay will mak thre, for gredynes. And can bring ane taill of nocht And say the thing that neuer was wrocht Nor neuer said nor neuer thocht, of wilfulnes Sum giue it credence euin as it docht, for gredynes. And euin sa did the Empreour Gaue sic credence vnto thir four To furneis gold and greit treasour, to his hienes Gaue thame leif to cast doun the Towre, for gredynes. Quhilk euer was to Romes toun Sic comfort and consolatioun Gif thay thocht gude to sum Regioun, thay wald them dres, Bot ?it the Towre was cassin doun, for gredynes. It is ane poysonit Pestilence For to giue ouir haistie credence To ane taill not worth audience, throw haistines The taill teller than tynes mence, for gredynes. Thair is mony ma than anew Will mak ane taill was neuer trew Nor ?it thame self it neuer knew, bot as thay ges Sum will say fals and efter rew, for gredynes. Thair is diuers tynes thair honour Thair worschip, riches, and plesour Oft tymes in vaine makis greit laubour, with small Incres And oft is ordorit by gude ordour, for gredynes. For gredynes causis greit greif Inuy, Malice, and mischeif Mony for Muttoun and for Beif, into mirknes Is hangit lyke ane commoun theif, for gredynes. Thairfoir gude Schirs I hartlie pray ?ow Cast gredynes on syde far fra ?ow With Iocund minde pas and ga play ?ow, in merynes Thair is na better charme I say ?ow, for gredynes. Now thir thre Kingis quhen thay did heir The Towre quhairof thay stude sic feir Was cassin doun but scheild or speir, throw wilynes In all haist maid thame to the weir, for gredynes. For first thay fand ane wylie way For to put Rome in greit affray And thocht thay wald it first assay, to get entres For thay wald mak it thair first pray, for gredynes. Beliue thay come and seigeit the toun In all gude haist the wallis brak doun, And put thame selfis in possessioun, with all blyithnes And fra the Empreour reft his Croun, for gredynes. Now Schirs this is the fynall end To gredynes quha will pretend Quhen thay can not thame self defend, be manlynes, Away with vengeance all dois wend, for gredynes. Thair is twa pointis into this taill Thame to forbeir is gude and haill, The first is gredynes but faill, of gold and geir, Haistie credence oft tymes brewis baill, thir twa forbeir. Ane reproche to the Emprice. O cative Quene and cruell, and rute of all mischeif, O fals flesche faint and fruell, greit grounder of all greif. Wyld rauins sall ryfe thy beif, wod dogis thy banis sal gnaw Or euer thow get releif, thy luddis sall thoill the Law. We sall gar all men knaw, and als perfytelie se Thy deidis the treuth sall schaw of thy hid harlatrie. The Taill of the Fyft Maister. Befoir this time ane Phisitioun thair was, Ane cunning Clerk, and namit Ypocras, Quhilk in Phisick and vther heich science, Ouir all vther he had preeminence. Als had with him ane kinsman of his awin Callit Galiene, quhais c?ning was weil knawin. All his Ingine and wit he did apply, To leir Phisick, and the same occupy. As his vncle at sic times had befoir, Quhairthrow he wan greit honour, laud &amp; gloir Bot in so muche Galiene was not sa ald, Zit he excellit his vncle monyfald: In Phisick airt, and into Medicene, He was mair schairp and quicker of Ingine. Than Ypocras persauing in his hart, That Galiene in craft was sa expart, Dreiding thairfoir that he suld him excell, And fra his gloir and profeit him expell. And thairfoir hid als mekill as he micht Fra Galiene, of the craft hid the slicht. Than Galiene this weill he did persaue, Kest him daylie the mair and mair to haue Of Phisick airt the mair he did obtene, On day mair than befoir in fyftene. Quhairby the Doctour tuik in his consait, That Galiene suld grow to greiter stait. Thairfoir at him he had lurking Inuy, Howbeit he had na querrel, caus nor quhy. In this meane time the King of Vngarie Send his message with schippis throw the sie For Ypocras, that he micht with him speik, And cure his sone that lay richt wonder seik Sa Ypocras the message did ressaue, Hartlie praying the messingers him to haue Sum part excusit vnto thair Nobill King, For he for eild micht mak na trauelling. Bot I sall send my Cousing and seruand, Quhat I will bid, that he sall tak on hand. Sa Galiene obeyit his vncles will, And in all pointis the same he did fulfill. And past his way vnto that Nobill King, Quha was richt blyith &amp; glaid of his c?ming. Bot he meruellit quhy come not Ypocras. Galiene said that auld and waik he was Micht not trauell, for na trauell he vsit, Praying his grace for to hald him excusit, And at that time had besines ado, That he na way as than micht cum him to. Bot in his steid he hes me to ?ow send, With help of God ?our Sone sone sall I mend Of the quhilk thing the King was weill cont?t Than Galiene vnto the Chylde he went, Felt his Punsis, and als his Vrine saw, Quhairby belyue his seiknes he did knaw. Incontinent than past he to the Quene, And said Madame, ?our seik Sone I haue sene And I am cum vnto ?our Nobill grace, Beseiking ?ow to heir me speik ane space. Tak na disdaine, thocht I now to ?ow speik, I come to heill ?our Sone that lyis seik. Scho said gude Schir say on quhat plesis ?ow For ?e will say nocht bot the treuth I trow. He said Madame tell on and mak na lie Quha is the Father of ?our Sone tell to me? Quha his Father (quod scho) quha bot y? King? Quod he Madame, thair is not sic a thing. Will ?e say so (quod scho) for veritie, Zeis want the heid I vow richt haistelie. Anis I said ellis, and ?it I say agane, This King is not his Father in certane. I come not heir thairfoir to lois my heid, Nor ?it Incur in my fault ony feid. Nor I haue not deseruit sic rewaird, Thocht I nane get, nathing I that regaird. Sa to the dure he maid him straicht away, The Quene that saw, and till him can scho say, O gude Maister sa ?e will keip secre I will ?ow schaw, sa ?e discouer not me. Than Galiene said, Madame God me defend, Bot I sa do vnto my lyues end. Thairfoir to me, to schaw the treuth be bald, For it agane sall neuer mair be tald, In greiter thing ?our grace sa sall I pleis, Zour sone mak haill, and put him weill to eis. Gif ?e sa do, gude Maister than scho said, Ze will mak me richt wonder blyith and glaid. Ane gude rewaird of me sa sall ?e haue, And of my Lord siclike ?e will not craue. Thairfoir heir me till I haue said sum thing Vpon ane time come to my Lord and King The King of Burgon, to pas the time with sport Quhat will ?e mair to mak my taill now schort To ?ow Maister, as now I will not lie, With me he gat this chylde in priuetie. Than Galiene said, feir not and speik no moir The taill I knew richt perfitelie befoir. Than to the Childe he past Incontinent, And did him cure with ane richt Regiment. Quhat he suld drink, and quhat suld be his meit Water to drink, and beif daylie to eit. Sa Galiene than within dayis thre, The Childe maid haill of his Infirmitie. Quhen that the King hard tell his sone was fre Of all seiknes, and of all Maladie. To Galiene ane gude rewaird he gaue, Bot he the dowbill fra the Quene did ressaue. With speciall thankis, and efter ay credence, Sa tuik his leif, and hamewart he past hence. Quhen he come hame to his Eme Ypocras, At Galiene but tary culd he as: How is the Childe that ?e past for to se? Schir he is haill of all seiknes, said he. Than Ypocras Inquirit him to conclude, Quhat he him gaue to his drink and his fude. He said he gaue him oxin flesche to eit, Water to drink, this was his drink and meit. Than Ypocras to Galiene said fra hand, The Mother is not trew to hir husband. Than Galiene said, now Maister suith ?e say, With displesour Ypocras past his way. Said to him self with haitrent and Inuy, Weill I persaue na man will set me by Within schort time, be na remedie found, Bot quyte to nocht my cunning is confound. Be his cunning he sall not faill to be, Praisit in his wark ten times abone me. And or sa war, without I fand remeid, Rather I sall conspire my Cousingis deid. Fra that time furth Ypocras ay him drest, How he micht get Galiene deid and supprest. In a morning Ypocras vp can rise, Past to his Garth, as his vse was and gise. To Galiene said with wordis fair and meik, Now let vs go in our garding and seik Herbes to be salf, that is of maist vertew, For as I wis thair is growing anew, Maister he said, I am reddy at hand, Quhat ?e pleis best to do as ?e command. Ypocras said tak vp that herb sa grene, For it is full of vertew as I wene. And sa he did at his Maisters command He pullit the herb, and gaue it in his hand: And at his nois the sawer thairof did smell, This herb (said he) of herbis beiris the bell. Stoup doun agane and pull vp be the rute, Of it I sall baith profite get and frute, For I knaw weill it is richt wonder gude To cuill Feuer, and to stem rynning blude Als of vertew it is richt comfortiue, To heill all Flux to ony man on liue. Sa Galiene na Ill hauing in minde, To pull the rute lawlie he did Inclinde. Quhilk wald not draw a lang time w? his hand Than Ypocras abone him he culd stand, And with his knife he struik him to the hart: Caus in science he thocht him ouir expart. Sone efter this Ypocras tuik seiknes, Be want of blude, and of corps febilnes. Than kest his buikis, &amp; socht his awin science, Him self to help he culd get na defence, Than his Scollers in all haist come him till, And to him said Maister quhat is ?our will. He bad thame bring ane twn of water fow, With ane w?mill a hundreth hoillis boir throw Quhen that was done thair went na water out Than Ypocras said to thame Schirs but dout, This is the wraith of leuing God sa hie, That this mischance hes sufferit fall on me. As ?e may se, and wonder weill persaue, For all is Iust and worthie that I haue. And as ?e se thair is into this twn Ane hundreth hoillis with Irins out throw run Throw all thir hoillis thair gais not out a drop Bot as ?e se dois stand still and stop, Quhilk to nature is contrair euerie deill, Quhairby ?e may all vnderstand richt weill. Richt sa thir herbis for heill that ?e gif me, May nathing help to my Infirmitie. Thairfoir quhat euer ?e tak vpon me cure, It helpis nathing ?e may be verray sure. For weill I wait as now is na remeid, Bot for my mis I mon now byde the deid. Bot war Galiene my Neuo now leuand, He wald not faill to mak me haill fra hand. Quhome I did kill throw malice and Inuy, Bot of that deid, richt sair repent now I. Thairfoir God hes be his Iust ordinance, Send vpon me this haistie sair vengeance. As he sa said na ma wordis than he tald, Bot turnit his bak, and vp the gaist he ?ald. The Maister said, hes ?our grace done consaue, The sempill wordis thar to ?ow schawin I haue The Empreour said weill I persaue the cace, That Galiene was killit be Ypocras. To Ypocras quhat hurt micht it haue bene, Quhat greit honour had cum to Galiene. The Maister said it micht be gude at all, Gif Ypocras to seiknes had bene thrall. Than Galiene perchance micht found remeid And at that time he suld not sufferit deid. Thairfoir becaus him self be Ill Intent Killit and put doun the verray Instrument Quhilk wald haue him supportit in this stres, Ze may persaue in God the greit gudnes, And richt Iudgem?t, that sa dul maid his hart, That he culd not him self help be na Art. Thairfoir my Lord it is euin sic ane cace. Betuix ?our sone and ?our awin Nobill grace And gif ?our sone for ?our wifes word ?e sla Considdering weill ?e wait ?e haue na ma. Quhen he is deid, ?e sall warie ?our weird, And wald be fane to scart him out of eird. Quhen ?e ar auld and may not help ?our sell He will ?ow help the treuth I to ?ow tell. Thairfoir giue not sic credence to ?our Quene, Scho will dissaue ?our grace quhen ?e leist wene Considder weill this is ?our secund wife, Ze may haue ma Induring ?it ?our life. Amang thame all ?it ?e sall neuer haue Sa wise ane Sone nane of thame sall consaue Sa verteous in wit dois mair precell, And in ?our eild will saue ?ow fra perrell. The Empreour said, for that ?e tell to me, Surelie this day my Sone he sall not die. Bot I persaue and wonder weill dois mark, That wemen bene richt craftie in thair wark. And richt subtell for to tyist ony man, As thay think gude, bot not the les quhat than. For my awin saik this day he sall not die, Quhen I haue neid I wait he will help me. The Maister said, I thank ?our nobill grace, Sa tuik his leif and past hame to his place. Quhen that this taill was tald to the Empres Gif scho was blyith the auditouris may ges. Scho schew hir self in minde Impatient, All that hir saw, beleuit that scho had went Quyte out of minde, and as ane bodie mad, And hir fyue wittis clene tynt away scho had. All that hir saw had pietie of hir cheir, Scho schoutit sa, that all the place micht heir Sum of the Lordis to the Empreour can ga And schew to him that it stude with hir sa. Thay said my Lord without ?e find remeid, Zour Emprice will hir awin self put to deid. Quhome to he past, and speirit at hir quhairfoir Euerie day ?e murne ay moir and moir. Scho said my Lord I meruell in ane part, That I birst not, and in twa brekis my hart. I knaw I am the dochter of ane King, And than ?our wife, quhilk is ane greiter thing In all my dayis sufferit I not sic schame, As I haue done, sen I come to ?ow hame. And euer mair ?e promeis me ane mendis, And as ?e do, God and the warld it kendis. The Empreour said I wait not quhat to do, Nor to quhat side is best to turne me to. For day be day ?e seik my Sonnis deid, And his Maisteris, thairof thay seik remeid. He is my Sone, that I beleue and knaw, Bot I can not the veritie ?it schaw: Quhidder I sall to ?ow gif mair credence, Than the Maisteris with all thair greit science Ze tell ane taill quhilk I think gude and fair, And thay ane vther, to ?ouris is plat contrair. The Emprice said that is the verray thing That troubillis my hart, &amp; causis my murning Becaus ?e gif thame ay the mair credence, And to thair taill takis greiter attendence, Nor to my taill, quhilk tellis the veritie, Quhilk ?e sall sair repent ?it or ?e die. And in few dayis ?e will get sic rewaird, As did ane King ressaue fra his Steward. The Empreour said, than tell me that taill sone Perchance ?our will thairefter may be done. Scho said I sall begin with diligence, Bot I pray ?ow to gif me audience. With peirt visage and countenance richt haill, On this fassoun began to tell hir taill. Zit or scho get of hir taill audience, Sum we will say of the last taill past hence. Moralitas. Ze may persaue now heir expres Of wemen the greit brukilnes, And of thair kynde the kittilnes, and scho ane Quene Hir awin preuitie did confes, to Galiene. At schort to him hir mynde hes schawin Ane King scho hauing of hir awin Ane vther tuik bot laitlie knawin, and of the new Bot monysic drauchts thay haue drawin, that few m? knew. For ane time scho mon be excusit Perauenture scho will not vse it, As now scho sall not be excusit, I say for me, Euin as ?e find the furde sa ruse it, quhat euer ?e be. And let sic quyet paukis ouir pas And sum thing say of Ypocras That sa full of Inuy he was, but caus or quhy Galiene he slew that was sa trew, throw pure Inuy. Ypocras clene I discommend Euer in hart for to pretend Sa far to Galiene offend, as him to sla Bot he repentit at his end, that he did sa. The principall caus heirof find I That Ypocras had sa greit Inuy At Galiene, this was the quhy, that Galiene was Mair firme and stabill, in craft mair abill, nor Ypocras. Ypocras suld haue had plesour That Galiene gat ony honour For he was Galienes Doctour, thairfoir say I He suld haue borne to him fauour, and not Inuy. Bot God of his greit Equitie Wald not thoill sic vnpuneist be Quhen Ypocras was in point to die, all his cunning Culd not than help him worth ane fle, at his ending. He said had Galiene bene leuand, He culd haue helpit him fra hand, Bot he wist weill it was the wand, that God had send Him sic distres and greit seiknes, that nane culd mend, The hid Inuy and greit haitrent, That he had to this Innocent Culd not eschew the punischment, of heuin sa hie Gude Schirs lay by all hid Inuy, keip cheritie. Inuy and cheritie ar contrair Thay can not in ane place repair Quhair cheritie is, ay God is thair, withouttin faill Inuy was, and is euer mair, with breif and baill. It is the fountaine and the flude Of schedding of all Innocent blude, And is contrair to all gude, and is the rute Inuy thairfoir sall neuer gloir, of Ioy the frute. Agustine discriues Inuy to be A man to haue sturt Inwartlie Of his Nichtbouris Felicitie, withouttin caus The quhilk is contrair cheritie, and Goddis Lawis. Doctouris wrytes thair is ane hill Callit Athnay, that ay byrnis still In flame of fyre and neuer will, be quenchit out, And ?it thay say it dois na Ill, to ground about. Quhilk hill cunning men dois compair To ane man that leuis euermair In sturt, Inuy, anger and cair, continuallie In fyrie fumes, himself consumes, ay Inwartlie. Inuyfull men comparit may be To ane Lipros man trewlie, He wald all men war seik as he, euin sa the Deuill Wald nane war gude, nor ?it weill lude, caus he is euill. Thairfoir my Lords and reidaris all Tuitching this point I cry and call Se to Inuy ?e be not thrall, for ocht may be, For the greit Lord Celestiall, is cheritie. Ane laude and praise to the Fyft Doctour. Prvdent, perfyte, expert Philosophour, Honour and praise be to the ding Doctour That hes ouirput this day sa perrellous With thy sweit talk befoir the Empreour Quha kendillit was in fell fyrie furour Contrair his Son in mynde malitious, Be entysing of his wyfe vennemous, But thow fra him with fair wordis and fauour Hes purchest grace, quhill tyme mair prosperous. Inuidia diaboli mors intrauit in orbem. Sapi. 2. The Sext Taill of the Emprice. Befoir this time thair was ane michtie King Prydefull in hart, and proud abone all thing He was sa heich and prydefull in his thocht, All vther men he set thame clene at nocht. This King he thocht all Rome for to destroy, The Romanis sla, and efter to conuoy To his Kingdome, the deid banes of thir two, Peter and Paull, with mony Relicks mo. To waist that toun, and put it all to sack, Bot his purpois was sum thing put abak, Intill his face was sa disfigurait, in sic ane sort, that euerie kinde of stait, Abhorrit sa, his vgsum foull visage, That nane couet to tuitche his personage. Sa handillit was with sic Infirmitie, With Lippernes, ane fouller nane culd be. Zit his nature rais on him with sic rage, To haue wemen he gaue ane greit curage. Sa callit he his Steward quyetlie, And schew to him his counsall secreitlie. Saying my freind, this thing I wil ?ow schaw All wemen kinde abhorris me as ?e knaw, That I can get of thame na companie, Quhilk gif I had, war greit plesure to me. He said my Lord and pleis ?our Nobill grace, Howbeit ?e be deformit in the face: Ze haue aneuch of gude money and gold, For to conduce the fairest on the Mold. Thairfoir I say ?e neid not in na sort Of fair wemen to want the greit comfort. Than said the King se for na coist ?e spair, To get me ane that is bricht fresche and fair: Howbeit ?e gif ane thousand Crownes thairfoir And or I want ?e sall gif mekill moir. The Stewart said I sall do that I may, To fill ?our will, and sa he come his way. Thinking in minde blindit with couetise Thir thousand Crowns may I get on this wise Win to my sell, and to my wife alone, And sa hame wart to his wife is he gone. Quha was richt fair, bowsum with all bewtie, Verteous and gude, richt plesand for to se, Prudent, perfite, with countenance richt glaid, With couetous hart to hir thir wordis he said. O my gude wife, my Souerane Lord the King Hes chargeit me with ane richt secreit thing: To haue wemen he is richt couetous, At his plesure, and wonder desirous. Quhilkis for na coist he sayis he will not want, And charges me ane thousand Crowns to gr?t To ony persoun that will the same ressaue, Bot for ane nicht with him hir for to haue. Thairfoir in minde my self I haue compest, Betuix vs twa, I think this be the best The thousand Crowns to purches to our sell, Sa ?e will vse, and follow my counsell. Scho said gude Schir ?our counsall I will do Sa to na sin nor schame it turne me to. He said ?e sall pas to the Kingis bed, Quhilk is with silk and claith of gold ouirspred And thair all nicht ly with him quyetlie, At his plesure, as he thinkis best to be. That it is ?e, thair is na man sall ken, Bot I alone, the quhilk abone all men Suld saif ?our schame and als ?our honestie, Thairfoir as schame to ?ow it cannot be. Allace scho sayis gude Schir is that ?our will, by ?our bodie, my womanheid to spill: With ane Lipper, and sa deformit in face, Schir change ?our minde for him that gaue all grace I wait it is nouther ?our thocht nor mind To sic ane deid my hart for to Inclind: Bot me to preif, and to tempt my Intent, Gif I thairto wald ony sort consent. O my gude wife howbeit he Lipper be And in the face deformit as ?e se, And foull of flesche, and also foull of blude, Zit than the gold is wonder sweit and gude. Scho said agane my sweit husband persaue Howbeit the gold be gude and sweit to haue, And thocht he war the clenest man thairout, Maist fair of face, gentill, courtes and stout. Wald ?e that I committit sic ane sin, Aganis my God, ony gold for to win? I will not dude, thairfoir hald me excusit, Charge me na mair, for heir quite I refuse it. Quhome to he said with ane richt austeir luik, How purpois ?e my companie to bruik. That thing I will to preis for to ganestand, Ze ar ouir peirt to contrair my command, It is my will, and that same salbe done. Thairfoir mak ?ow that Ilk to compleis sone. Do ?e it not, I vow betuix vs tway Sall neuer be ane blyith nor Ioyfull day, Bot euer mair in chyding and in greif, Quhilk at the last will turne to ane mischeif. Knaw ?e not weill to the Kirk quhen ?e went, Ze swoir ?e suld be ay obedient, To me alone, as wedlok vs declairis. Ze Schir scho said in all lefull effairis: Not displesing my maker King of Kingis, I will obey ?ow in all vther thingis. I ?ow command be vertew of that aith, Quhilk for to brek ?e suld be wonder laith. Considdering it is my minde and will, Without ganesay my bidding ?e fulfill. And to the same richt sone that ?e consent Or I auow richt sair ?e sall repent, In the mean time as he thir wordis schew, Out of his scheith his quhin?ar furth he drew. Scho trimbling sair for greit dreddour and feir Furth of that steid ane step scho durst not steir. Persauing weill his crueltie and boist, And in greit dout hir life for to be loist. The Impatience and the greit gredynes, The cruell minde and als the crabitnes Of this Ill man this woman did attend, Quhilk in na sort nor fassoun culd amend. Scho was constranit quhat for dreddour &amp; aw, For to consent to his command and saw. Scho said gude man ?our bidding I mon do, Bot greit God knawis gif my will be thairto. Bot I appeill fra all consent of sin, That may follow, or in this cace cum in. And on ?our self all haill I lay the charge, And befoir God thairof I me discharge. Than the Stewart but ony tarying Past in all haist and said vnto the King: I haue ?ow gottin ane woman richt famous, Gentill, courtes, and cum of ane gude hous. Fair and weill fauourit, richt plesand for to se, And scho mon cum to ?ow richt quyetlie: Within the nicht scho mon cum lait at eine, Bot me alone, with nane scho will be sene Airlie at morne befoir the Sone rysing Fra ?ow siclike scho mon mak departing. For this scho will ane thousand Crownes haue, And for payment bot me nane will scho craue, Than said the King of that I am content, As ?e haue done thairto I weill consent. Withouttin mair the Stewart he hes led His awin spousit wife vnto the Kingis bed, And with the key the dure he hes maid fast, But ony noyis, and sa his way is past. Airlie at morne in dawing of the day: The Steward rais, and to the King can say, My Souerane Lord &amp; pleis ?our Nobill grace It will be day within ane prettie space. I think it gude that woman ?e let go, For I promeist that ?our grace suld do so. Than said the King this woman plesis me Sa wonder weill as ?it hir companie, I will not want nouther for gold nor geir, This hour to cum I will not let hir steir. Quhen he that hard, he was richt wonder wo And fra the dure with sorie hart did go. Within ane quhile but tary come agane, And to the King he said Schir for certane, The day is licht, and that woman present, And with the folk scho will be schamelie schent. And my promeis to hir quyte I haue brokin. For not keiping to hir that I haue spokin. Than said the King, na way ?it sall scho pas, For scho sall haue of me quhat scho will as. Thairfoir Stewart I say to ?ow in plane, Go pas ?our way and lok the dure agane. The Stewart than richt sorrowfull in hart, Vpon neid force to the dure did depart. Went vp and doun, and wist not quhat to say, The Sone was heich, and weill gane of y? day, He come agane and said vnto the King, It is twa houris efter the Sone rysing That woman will be schent withouttin dout, With all the folk and pepill heir about. The King answerit, nathing of him content, I ?ow command that ?e ?our self absent: Vnto the time that I pleis for to rise, For vnrequyrit ?e haue me troublit thrise, And my plesure is with this companie. Thairfoir pas on, at this time let me be. The Stewartis hart gif it was than on steir, As I beleue thair neidis na man to speir. Zit not the les he culd not keip counsell, For all his wit he wald discriue him sell. Incontinent without mair auysing, With sorie hart he said vnto the King. O my gude Lord, I oppin to ?ow my hart, That Ilk woman ?e will not thoill depart Without licence, scho is my weddit wife, Now in ?our hands lyis baith my deid and life. The king hard that, &amp; thocht all was not richt Opinit windois and saw the fair day licht, Saw the woman quha was lustie in face, Ane word not spak ane Pater noster space, Sine saw it was euin as the Stewart said, Quhairof he was richt sorie and not glaid. Quhome to he said, O thow maist schamefull knaif How durst thow be sa peirt me to dissaif. And me to caus thy wife for to abuse, Thy gredie hart thy self it sall confuse. Quhy hes thow causit thy wife vnwillinglie Cum in my bed to me vnwittandlie. For ane small sowme of money and riches To schame thy self for thy greit gredynes. Knew thow not weill withouttin ony fabill, My maladie was euer Incurabill That was in the thow hes done I declair, Thy self, thy wife, to vndo euer mair. Thairfoir pas swyith in haist out of my sicht, Nor in my realme that thow byde not four nicht And fra hence furth gif euer I may the sie, Ane schamefull deid I auow thow sall die. Incontinent he past fra his presence, And neuer saw the King fra that time hence. Quyte of his Realme fra thame he did him dres That Ilk rewaird he gat for gredynes. This being done, the King in all his dayis, Held vp this wife, as the historie sayis: In greit worschip, and gaue to hir ?eirlie, Ane sowme of gold to keip hir honestlie. Efter that time I do not find nor reid With this woman that he had actuall deid. Sone efter this the King causit to conuene Ane greit armie all cled in armour clene. With greit puissance and nobill men of weir, In all effairis, as to thame culd effeir. And went to Rome with greit power &amp; micht To seige the same the gait thay held on richt. And sa thay did it seige on ather syde, That the Romanis durst not thairin abyde. He seigeit it still sa sad and wonder sair, That thay within micht it defend na mair. Sa at the last to ane counsall thay went, Thinking yai wald with y? King tak pointm?t Quhilk was for till deliuer him at anis Of Peter and Paull the blist bodie and banis, Quhilk was the caus of his greit erand thair For to obtene the same withouttin mair. In the Cietie than thair was still present Seuin wise Maisteris that had the Regiment, Of all the toun, and nathing by thame done, Airlie at morne, at euin nor ?it at none. And to thir seuin the Cieti?anis come to, And said Maisteris greit thing we haue ado. We are compellit be force of ?one armie For to gif ouir and rander the Cietie Vnto thir folkis quhilk ar our enemeis, Or ellis for to deliuer the bodeis: Of gude Peter and Paull his halie brother, On force we mon the ane do or the vther. The first Maister agane to thame he said, My gude nichtbouris tak na feir bot be glaid. As for this day the Cietie I sall saue, With the wisdome and cunning that I haue. The secund said, the nixt day fallis me, Fra enemeis for to keip the Cietie, With my wisdome, and als my cleir cunning, For all the strenth of ?one greit puissant King. Sa did the thrid, and fourt withouttin dout, The fyft, the sext, richt sa the seuint all out. In like maner as thir seuin Maisters now, Vnto ?our Sone hes promeist do with ?ow. In this meane time the King causit his Armie Lay ane assault about the greit Cietie. With sic awfull and cruell Munitioun, Quhill thay war like for to obtene the toun. The first Maister than he come to the King, And with him fell in talk and commoning. And talkit sa in sic maner and wise, As for that day he gart his Armie rise. And fra the toun the Seige abak he drew, As for that day na mair thay did persew. Bot on the morne the Seige agane thay laid, The nixt Maister past to the King and said In like maner as the vther befoir, And fra that day thay seigeit the toun no moir. Sa did thay all, quhill it come to the last, On the seuint day thay seigeit the toun sa fast, It was beleuit the same thay wald obtene, Than all the toun togidder did conuene. All in ane voice to the seuint Maister said, About the toun sa strang ane seige is laid, That we beleue nathing bot cruell deid. Without that ?e find sum help and remeid: Conforme to the sayingis ?e said but dout, That was Ilk ane to saif ?our day about. And we ar all Informit of suretie, The King hes maid his aith solempnitlie, He sall not rais his seige nor Munitioun, Vnto the time that he obtene the toun. To ?ow Maister now we can say no moir, We wald ?e did as ?our fellowis befoir. Quhome to he said, my freindis tak ?e na feir, Be of comfort, and Ilk ane mak gude cheir. The morne sall I with my wark and cunning Skaill all ?one hoist, and also fray the King. He salbe fane for all his greit puissance, To pas away with his greit Ordinance. Thay went thair way, &amp; na mair tuik in thocht Bot all meruellit how sic thing culd be wrocht. The morne airlie the seige was confirmit, To haue the toun also the King determit. This seuint Maister to his Chalmer he went, And cled him in ane nice abil?ement. As Pacok taillis, and fedderis of all kin hew. Part reid, part quhite, part ?allow grene &amp; blew Ane bricht drawin sword he tuik in euerie hand On ane Towre heid he past vp for to stand. Quhilk was maist heich of all the haill Cietie, Fornentis the hoist, that thay micht all him se. The twa bricht swordis into his mouth he tuik The same schynand, vpon the armie schuik. Quhilis turnis eist, and vther quhilis west. Quhyls south, quhyls north, quhair yai micht se h? best The schin?d swords aganis y? sone sa bl?t With his cleithing and strange abil?ement. Thay in the hoist richt weill and cleirlie saw, Bot quhat it was na man of thame did knaw. All the greit Lordis quhen thay beheld sic thing, Half in effray thay past all to the King: And said O Lord, behald vpon ?one Towre We se this day ane wonderfull Figour. Than said the King the same I do persaue, Bot quhat it is, na knawledge I can haue. Thay said we knaw quhat thing it is but dout It is Iesus doun of the heuin cum out: Quhilk is the God of all ?one Christin folk, And knawis richt weill how that we do prouok His awsum Ire, and how we do pretend To sla his folk, the quhilk he will defend. Zone samin swords that ?e se schining sa, Thay signifie Ilk ane thay will vs sla, Gif we langer into this feild abyde, Our counsall is thairfoir hame that we ryde. The King heiring trimblit for verray feir, Gart rais his hoist and all his men of weir: And said it is better in time we fle, Nor ?one thair God with his swords gart vs die Than all the hoist in haist thay maid th? hame Frayit without caus, w? mekill scorne &amp; schame Howbeit to fle na perrell was nor neid, Bot all dissait be the Maisteris fals deid. Quhen the Romanis persauit the Armie fle, Ilk ane thay Ischit, and past of the Cietie. With manlie hart and gudlie countenance, Followit the King for all his Ordinance. Slew and destroyit all that thay plesit that day And quhome thay list captiue yai brocht away And sa the King and all his greit Armie Brocht was to ground be the greit subteltie Of this Maister, quha wrocht all be dissait, That with power na maner culd debait. The Emprice than said to the Empreour This taill I tald it is vnder cullour. Bot wald greit God this taill ?e vnderstude. He said Madame, I think it wonder gude. In the first end (quod scho) I wait ?e hard, Quhat I ?ow tald of the gredie Steward: That the King trowit asweill as his awin life, And ?it for gold he sauld his weddit wife. And als him self was baneist the countrie, Becaus the King fand him sa fals and slie. In like maner ?our Sone for the desire And appetite he hes to the Impire. Now day by day it is his minde and thocht, Zow to destroy, and bring ?ow vnto nocht. Bot now sa lang as ?e ar in ?our micht, Do as the King did with the Stewart richt. Gif ?e purpois not to sla him fra hand Than baneis him, and als manesweir the land That ?e and I quhilk is ?our weddit wife, In time c?ming that we may leid our life: Also ?e hard how the King lay at Rome, To win the same how that he did presume, And was mockit be the Maisters in plane, He and his folkis war all put doun and slane. Zour seuin Maisters into the samin wise, Intendis ay to siclike Interprise. With thair fals taillis at end will ?ow dissaue, That ?our fals sone all the Impire may haue. The Empreour said be na way that salbe, The morne be time he sall not faill to die. Incontinent he callit on his seruandis, And to thame all he gaue sic strait commandis, That on the morne without Impediment, On the Gallous but faill his Sone to schent. This word beliue past out throw all the toun, Quhairat mony maid lamentatioun, That the Empreour for the wordis of his wife Fra his ane Sone suld with schame tak the life. The sext Maister hard tell of this effray, Lap on his hors withouttin mair delay. Poistit fra hand vnto the Empreour, And hailsit him with reuerence and honour. Quha tuik the same verray vnthankfullie, And said he seruit at his hand for to die, And als his Sone quhome y? yai had maid dum Thay war ouir peirt in his presence to cum. The Maister said I serue not for to die, Nor ?it ?our Sone, knew ?e the veritie. That he is dum quhair ?e alledge and sayis, Of that the treuth ?e sall knaw in few dayis. Gif ?e him sla for it ?our wife can tell, Of ?our wisdome than I haue greit meruell. And without dout it sall ?ow happin richt As it happinnit sum time vnto ane Knicht. To his wyfes sawis gaue sic fidelitie, That he was drawin out throw the haill Cietie At ane hors taill, and hangit like ane theif, His wifes sawis brocht him to sic mischeif. The Empreour said I pray the tell that taill, The Maister said Schir that I sall not faill. Sa ?e will caus ?our Sone to cum agane, And for this day ?e let him not be slane. Incontinent the Empreour gaue command, To the presoun to leid his Sone fra hand. And sa was done, the Maister than but mair, To tell his taill began this to declair. The Doctouris taill farthermair or we heir, Sum morall sence of the last let vs leir. Moralitas. This prydefull King, he culd not Ring With measure and humilitie He was sa proude, he thocht nane coude Compair to him thair micht not be. The Lord of aw, persauit and saw, That his hart was sa proude and hie He wald correct, him and Infect, With plague and greit Infirmitie. Quhair thair is pryde, grace can not byde, Out of that rowme beliue he rinnis Intill all haist, as he war chaist, To lawlynes to seik ane Innis. The bricht Angell, for pryde he fell, In hell ?it still in paine ay winnis, I say ?ow all, that man sall fall His wark with pryde alway beginnis. The wise man wrytes, quhair he Indytes All beginning of Ill is pryde, And mony ma sayis euin richt sa, Into thair wrytings dois not hyde, Thairfoir the Lord, na way will cord Quhair pryde hes credence for to gyde I ?ow declair, he scurges sair For quhair pryde is God will not byde. Of his Iustice, sic wickit vice, He will not thoill vnpuneist be, Be battell Pest, weir or wanrest Sum perrellous plague or pouertie Hounger and skant, fude for to want Infectit with Infirmitie Thairfoir fle pryde all time and tyde, And held ?ow with humilitie. Als in this taill, withouttin faill Greit couetice ?e may persaue The fals Stewart, that fand the Art The King him self and wyfe dissaue, Bot on him sell, the sorrow fell, He was worthie the same to haue To be exylit, that King begylit, I say for me he playit the knaue. That his awin wyfe, first fylit hir lyfe, And syne hir saull with deidlie sin, Fy Stewart fy, was that thy quhy, Sa fulischlie geir for to win With couetice, and auarice, At sic ane fals gait to begin For gredynes to win riches, Ouir mony to the Deuill wald rin. Be commoun thift, sum makis thair schift, In this warld quhill thair lyfe be endit, To pluk the pure thay tak na cure, Quha hes na power to defend it. Sum reifis and ruggis, sum drawis and druggis, And purpois neuer to amend it, Bot quhen its win, few of ?our kin, Nor ?it ?our self perchance sall spend it. Sa couetous, and desyrous This Stewart was gold for to win, He cairit nocht, for to haue brocht His wyfe to schame and deidly sin. Quhidder he gat it, or nocht few wait it For fra he and the King did twin In deid I trow, to say to ?ow, He had ane vthir wob to spin. He chargeit was, suith for to pas Out of the Realme or be confound His awin falset, snairit him in net, His deid till himself did redound. Bot quha wald mak ane happy pak Se falset thairin be not found Lawtie and licht, schawis ay the richt, On gredynes mak not ?our ground. Auaritia est inordinatus amor habendi, tullius. As to this King that lay seiging, And was sa frayit for Pacok taillis, And twa bricht swordis, with sum vaine wordis. Without mair skaith his armie skaillis, His Camp to rais, and saw few fais, I think thay war bot snifland snaillis The Potingair takis lytill cair To cure the man that nathing aillis. Ane King suld ay, at sic assay Haue ane sad counsall him besyde, Perchance ane fray may mak him pray And gar him fle quhen he suld byde, Daft vaniteis, groundit with leis, At all times he suld let ouirslyde Be circumspek, and in his nek Ay haue ane Ey all time and tyde. Haistie credence dois greit offence, Gif it be in ane Conquerour, Richt weill suld he, auisit be, To euerie taill to giue answer. Intreit his Lordis, as weill accordis Than thay will serue him with honour With blyith visage, gar pay his wage, He sall triumphe and be victour. Had he sa done, not half sa sone He had not bene sa lichtlie chaist Bot the Doctour, vpon the Towre Maid him out of his mynde amaist. Captaines and Kingis tent to sic thingis To all trattillis ?e giue na traist, For gi? do, it will cum to, As to the King that saw the Gaist. Ane reproche to the Emprice. Gomorras graceles gyde, and Sodomes schameles seid, Thow Beliallis bitrer byrd, baith fals in word and deid Thy boist thow blawis on breid, sall not saif thee I say, Thy ers brint in ane gleid, I think to se sum day, Thow sall not sa away, thow commoun curst Cowclink Trowis thow to chaip nay, nay, I rather neuer drink. The Taill of the Sext Maister. Vpon ane time thair was in Romes toun Ane Empreour of greit micht and Renoun, Quha had greit Kingis into his companie, Lordie, Barrounis, Knichts, of greit Nobilitie Doing seruice as culd thame best effeir. Sum for pastime, and sum to stuf his weir. He had thre Knichts quhome he lude ouir y? laif In all effairis mair credence to thame gaif. Ane vther Knicht thair was in the Cietie, That had weddit ane lustie gay Ladie, As ?e haue done, ?our Princes and ?our wife Quhome he lufit asweill as his awin life. This Lady culd mak mirrie sing and dance, In companie scho culd mak gude pastance. Wantoun ?oung men euin for that samin caus, To hir ludgeing all time of day scho drawis. And at all times scho sang sa wonder sweit, That euerie man that past vpon the streit: Had greit plesure of hir dulce melodie, And causit Ilk man couet hir companie. Scho sang sa sweit, sa curious and cleir, All had delite hir singing for to heir. And sa come by ane of the Knichtis thre, That the Empreour lufit sa Inwartlie. And hard hir sing with voice sa curious, Trowit weill scho was ane Lady amorous. He blent about, and saw quhair that scho set, Incontinent he was tane in the net: Of lufis rage, and of the Lady fair Euin still he stude, and past na farther mair, Quhill time he gat into hir hous entrie, And for ane time bure thair gude companie. Sa at the last he fell in commoning With this Lady, of lufe and sic talking. Sa Inwartlie at hir he did Inquire, Quhat scho wald haue and fulfill his desire, And sleip with him bot the space of ane nicht. Scho askit him ane hundreth Florens bricht. He said Lady I will giue ?ow na les, Schaw me the time quhen I thairto sall dres. Scho said gude Schir at time conuenient, Quhen I think time ?e salbe efter sent. Sa Instantlie that nicht he did depart, And of his tryist was wonder blyith in hart. Beleuing sure that scho suld for him send, Bot small he knew how all wald cum to end. Sa on the morne scho sang into hir bour, Come the nixt Knicht pertenit the Empreour, Saw this Lady, and hard hir voice sa sweit, Tuik greit langour quhill he culd with hir meit And sa he did, and schew to hir his minde, Vnto the quhilk scho was richt weill Inclinde, Quha promeist hir of gude Florens fyue scoir. Scho said gude Schir of ?ow I ask no moir. He said Lady quhen sall I traist heirto. Ane gude dew time I sall prouyde (quod scho) Sa he as than departit mirrelie, Traisting his tryist in all thing weill suld be. On the thrid day the thrid Knicht in like wise, Come by hir hous, and the same Interprise: He tuik on hand, and hecht to this Lady Fyue scoir Florens of him suld haue reddy, For to performe and satisfie his will, Scho was content, and grantit weill thairtill. Quhen sall I cum (quod he) I wald ?e schew. I sall send word (quod scho) as I am trew. Sa all thir thre had gottin hir consent, Bot nane of thame knew ?it vtheris Intent. Than this Lady of all malice repleit, To hir husband scho said into secreit. Secreit maters I haue to ?ow till schaw, Bot ?e alone na persoun sall it knaw. And gif ?e will the samin tak on hand, For greit profeit to vs baith it will stand. And will releif vs of all pouertie, In time c?ming, and leif in honestie. He said gude dame I can weill keip counsell, Of ony thing that ?e will to me tell. To keip counsell it pertenis to ane man. Bot be contrair, thair is na woman can. Of thair counsell I reid anis in ane taill, It is comparit to butter into Caill. Zit not the les the suith gif ?e will schaw, Quhat euer it be, thair is na man sall knaw. Quod scho it is ane thing of veritie, That may vs hald ay into honestie. Schaw me (said he) and I sall keip counsell, Of all secreitis that ?e will to me tell. At my power the same I sall fulfill: Thairfoir schaw furth gif that it be ?our will. Quod scho gude schir yair hes bene Knichts thre Heir diuers times desiring lufe of me, And promeist me but dout ane gude propine, Ilk ane of thame fyue scoir of Florens fine, At sindrie times Ilk ane come quietlie, Not ane knawing of vthers preuitie: Culd we this gold vnknawin get in our hand, Into greit steid but dout it suld vs stand. Than said the Knicht dame ?e say veritie, Bot of gude ?eill tell on how can that be. Scho said gude Schir my counsall ?e sall heir, How ?e sall do, the way I sall ?ow leir. I promeist thame euerie man be him sell, Quhen thay sall cum, the time I suld thame tell, In the same time at the ?et ?e sall stand, Richt quietlie with ?our drawin sword in hand And quhen thay cum into thair ordour sa, Ze sall not faill all thre thame for to sla. Sa thre hunder Florens we sall obtene, And nane sall knaw, nor ?it the Knichts be sene. Quhome to he said, O my belouit wife, Suld I for gold reif ony man his life? To do sic thing of God I stand sic aw, And als it is contrair the Kingis Law. And I dout not gif sic ane thing war done, Withouttin dout it suld be knawin sone. Quod scho feir not, the deid I tak on hand, To end it furth peirtlie thair at sall stand. And quhen he hard the taill than that scho tald, It maid the man mair hardie and bald. Sa be counsall of this Ill wifes Intent, Scho causit this Knicht to that slauchter cons?t This Ill woman quhen c?min was the nicht, Incontinent scho send for the first Knicht. But mair abaid vnto the ?et come he, As he thocht best, knokit richt quyetlie. Than answerit scho, and at him can scho speir, Haue ?e not brocht the hundreth Florens heir? But dout (said he) I haue thame heir present, Than scho vndid the ?et Incontinent. As he come in, and enterit at the ?et, Than hir husband sic ane straik on him set, Without mair talk, bot schortlie with his sword Gaue him sic wappis that he spak neuer word. With the secund he did the samin gise, And with the thrid he plaid on the same wise. To ane secreit Chalmer thair bodeis drew, That nane suld knaw that he ony man slew. Than said he dame gif thair bodeis be found Within this place, or ?it within this ground. It sall not faill bot we thairfoir sall die The maist vyle deid that can Imaginit be. Thay will be mist into the Court but dout, And will be socht in all thir partis about. Scho said gude Schir, this wark first I began To end that Ilk richt wonder weill I can. My Ioy feir not, as I said ?ow befoir, For I can dres sic thing and it war moir. This Lady had into the same Cietie, Ane gentill man, and hir brother was he: Quhilk in the toun the gyding had to keip, Ouir all the watche, that thay na way suld sleip Sa on ane nicht as he past throw the streit, At hir awin ?et hir brother culd scho meit. Ane secreit thing (quod scho) my deir brother, I mon ?ow schaw, as now to nane vther. Than enterit he and the Knicht hir husband, Welc?mit him weill, and tuik him be the hand Talkit at lenth and mirrelie drank the wine, And than the Knicht said to hir brother sine, Brother (said he) richt hartlie I Inquire, Of ?our counsall richt greitlie I desire To haue the same, for thairof I haue neid. Hir brother said, trewlie sa God me speid, At my power, my counsall and gude thocht, Ze sall not want, and thairin dout ?e nocht. Scho said brother this is the verray cace, Zisterday last thair come vnto our place, Vnkend to vs, ane honest nobill Knicht. Quhome we Intreitit the best maner we micht, And sa be chance he fell in argument Quhairat my husband stude nathing content. At last he ran sa heich in vilanie, Quhat wald ?e mair my husband gart him die. And still he lyis into ane Chalmer hid, To na persoun as ?it is knawin nor kid. And we haue nane to do for vs as now This greit mater for to conuoy bot ?ow. Gif he be found with vs as chance may be, It will not faill, but dout we will baith die. And sa scho maid bot mentioun of ane Knicht, Not schawing him the veritie nor richt, Hir brother said deliuer him to me, I sall him beir in ane sek to the se. Scho heiring that was w?der blyith and glaid Deliuerit him the deid Knicht as scho said. And the hie gait to the sey he is past With the deid Knicht, and thairin did him cast. This being done, to his sister he said, Ze ar now quyte of ?one thairfoir be glaid. As ?e desirit this mater now is drest, Now fill the wine let vs drink of the best. That sall ?e haue (quod scho) with mirrie cheir, With all our hartis the best that we haue heir. To the Chalmer in all haist past scho sine, As it had bene for to haue brocht him wine. And than begouth with ane loud voice to cry, O deir brother richt wonder frayit am I The same Ilk Knicht that ?e kest in the se, In our Chalmer agane is cum to me. Than hir brother thairof had greit meruell, Quhen that he hard his sister sa him tell. And I traist that thair can not be sic thing, Zit not the les agane to me him bring. I sall him put he sall not cum agane, Bot still for ay I wait he sall remane. He band him fast vnto ane vther sek, With ane greit stane hingand about his nek. The next Knicht tuik, beleuing that it was The first deid Knicht and to the sey can pas, Vpon his bak, the hie gait makis richt. And thair but mair castis in the secund Knicht. Than come he hame to his sister and said, Na mair ?e sall with ?one Knicht be affraid; For he is cast into the sey sa far, That weill I wait he sall neuer cum nar, Thairfoir fill wine, and let vs drink about, For of ?one Knicht I put ?ow out of dout. To hir Chalmer to fetche wine scho did fane, With ane loud voice scho cryit frayitlie agane, O my brother the Knicht I say ?ow sure, Quhome ?e did drowne, is in my Chalmer flure Wo be to me, I wait not quhat to say, For be na meane he will not byde away. The brother hard, and said quhat deuill is this That verray Knicht he is sum witche I wis I haue him drownit twa sindrie times but dout And ay agane of the sey c?mis out. Zit the thrid time deliuer him to me, And I na mair sall cast him in the se: Bot I sall burne his banis into ane fire. Brother (said scho) that same thing I desire. Than scho deliuerit the last Knicht of the thre, And he beleuit it was the first trewlie, Sa the thrid Knicht away with him hes tane Knawing nathing bot all thre had bene ane. Without the toun ane myle fra the Cietie, In ane Forest a greit fire biggit he, And the thrid Knicht thairin he kest to burne, Beleuing weill he had done ane gude turne That put away the verray Instrument That was abill his sister to haue schent. This deid knicht brint, that vther did him speid As bec?mis all, to do his naturall deid. Vp fra the fire he past ane bowschot space Into the wod to do sic besines. And sa it chancit that samin verray nicht, Come throw the wod rydand ane vther Knicht, Quhilk had ane tryist the morne in the Cietie, At ane Iusting thair him behude to be. For werynes was baith houngrie and cald, He blent about, and the fire culd behald. Him to refresche hidder he raid thairto, Bot he wist not quhat had bene thair ado. He lichtit doun, knit his hors to ane tre, And to the fire Incontinent past he, To warme his hands, and to comfort his cors, And for ane quhile to rest his tyrit hors. Than the same knicht that was y? womans brother Come to the fire agane and saw ane vther Stand at the fire, quhome to he said in hy, Quhat may thow be, he said ane Knicht am I. Quod he agane I wait thow art na Knicht, Thow art ane deuill, that weill I wait full richt Twise I the drownit, the first time in ane sek, The secund time ane greit stane at thy nek. And now thridlie, I brint the in this fire, And ?it to leif me think thow will not tire. War thow the deuill, and als the deuillis dam Or I war c?merit with the sa as I am, I rather burne the ten times in ane fire, Thy hors thy self, baith bowk banis and lire. As he sa said, in his armes he him tuik, In middis the fire he kest him in the smuik. And sine his hors abone him also kest, Sa brint thame baith or euer he tuik rest. To his sister than come he hame agane, Quhat him betid he tald to hir in plane. Fill the best wine (quod he) and spair it nocht For without dout richt deir I haue it bocht. Efter in the fire that I had brint him anis, Incontinent he standis vp bowk and banis, Befoir the fire, and his hors him beside, Quhat deuil (said I) me think thow schaipis to ride Sa in the fire I kest him hors and all, All this sister said he chancit me befall. Than in hir minde scho knew Incontinent, That he had brint ane Knicht of tornament. Zit not the les scho brocht him the best wine, Drank mirrelie, and sa past his way sine. Not lang efter this wife and hir awin Knicht Fell in debait, bechance vpon ane nicht. And scho him gaue sum wordis outrageous, Hie and haltand, and verray dispittous. Quhairthrow he grew at hir in matalent, Twa stripis or thre, till hir sa hes he lent. Than said this wife theif wil thow murther me As thow hes done the Empreouris Knichts thre Thow seruis weill to be hangit and drawin, Gif sic thing war vnto our nichtbouris knawin. Nichtbouris about thir cruell wordis did heir The rumour rais, the folkis grew all in feir. Word went fra hand vnto the Empreour, Thay war send for but ony delatour. Quha was accusit for sic ane cruell crime, Sone scho confest the deid, the hour and time. How he murdreist the Empreour Knichts thre Within the nicht, into greit crueltie And how that thay spuil?eit fra euerie Knicht, Fyue scoir Florens of gold that was sa bricht. And how that scho the mater first Inuentit, And how that he thairto first disassentit. Sa thay war baith condampnit be the Law, That officers at hors taillis suld thame draw: To the Gallous, out throw the haill Cietie, To thair greit schame, that ilk man micht it se. On the Gallous thay war baith put to deid, As thay deseruit, but mercie or remeid. The Maister said vnto the Empreour Seruit thay not deid, y? maid sa greit murthour The Empreour said that wife was wonder euil Be apperance was temptit with the deuill. Scho was the first the mater mufit and bred, Siclike the first the samin gart out spred. The Maister said war sall cum to ?our sell, Sla ?e ?our sone for ?our Ill wifes counsell. My sone (said he) for that now ?e haue said, Thair sall na charge of deid be to him laid As for this day, thairfoir pas to ?our place. The Maister said God saue ?our nobill grace, Sa tuik his leif, and with ane mirrie hart, To his awin hous, fra the Court did depart: Quhen the Emprice of thir tythance hard tell Scho was maist like for to haue slane hir sell. As ane wod wife come to the Empreour, Behald (said scho) ane woman of dolour. Except that ?e get me soner remeid, I sall but dout my awin self put to deid. I am sa schamit with the countrie about, That I think schame of my Chalmer cum out And na remeid quhat euer I do or say, Bot with the fals Taillis put of fra day to day, Fy vpon ?ow that sufferis sic ane thing, Ze ar not worth to be Empreour or King. Ze cure na schame, ?e cure na warldis wonder To haue me schamit, and ?our self put to vnder And to be schamit &amp; callit ane Empreours wife I sall rather my self fall on my knife. The pane of deid Induris bot half ane hour, Bot euer mair schame sall degraid honour. The Empreour said I pray God ?ow defend, That ?e tak not sic ane vnhappie end. To tak in thocht ?our awin self for to sla, Quhat euer ?e do, I pray ?ow do not sa. And I pray God that I not causer be Of sic mischance, nor sic aduersitie. Bot will ?e thoill and suffer ane schort quhile, Zour caus will cum to ane far better stile, And ?our complaint will haue the better end Zour Iust querrell euer I sall defend. Quod scho agane, the end sall not be gude, Baith ?ow and me it sall vs baith exclude Of this Impire, and put vs to confusioun, Zone seuin Maisters leidis ?ow in sic abusioun. That it sall chance to ?ow heir efterwart, As it come to ane King and his Stewart. The Empreour said, I pray ?ow now but faill Of ?our gudnes to tell me furth that taill, Scho said my Lord to tell ane taill agane, Weill I persaue it will be bot in vane: For the nixt day the seuint Maister will cum, And tell ane taill to saif ?our sone thats dum, And help him as his fellowis did befoir, Fra thay haue done, ?e will heir me no moir. On the aucht day than sall ?our awin sone cum And tell his taill quhilk this lang time was d? To quhais talking ?e sall giue sic plesour, That I salbe put furth of ?our memour. And the greit lufe betuix vs twa hes bene, In time c?ming now salbe for?et clene. The Empreour said sic ane thing can not be, Without ?e serue the same vnwittand me. Quhilk I beleue was neuer in ?our thocht, Thairfoir as ?it sic thing trow will I nocht. The Emprice said, than I sall tell my taill, Quhilk to ?our grace it sall greitlie auaill. And caus ?ow fra greit perrellis eschew Quhilk I persaue is ellis prepairit for ?ow. Be ?our curst sone, and his seuin Maisters all Quhilk efter this richt weill persaue ?e sall. The Empreour said, now I pray ?our gudnes, Tell furth that taill, and leif ?our besines. Sa scho began hir taill with fen?eit cheir, Not blyith at hart, as he sall after heir. Bot or scho tell hir taill furth to the King, Of the last taill now let vs say sum thing. Moralitas. O mercie God quhat thing is this, The mater greitly meruellis me That cunning Clerkis can not discus The Ill and the Iniquitie That in wemen bene, Bred with greit tray and tene The greit dissait and subteltie Sic kenenes with greit crueltie Was neuer hard nor sene. This Lady in hir windo set, Singing hir noitis sa curious Presenting thair the deuillis net Under cullour sa cautelous ?oung men ar till hir gane, And in hir net ar tane And thair with mynde malitious In hart being sa couetous Causit murdreis thame Ilk ane. This murther first scho did Inuent That causit thir men for to be slane Syne was the verray Instrument First for to mak it knawin agane Sa mony wayis scho fand, For to tyist hir husband To do mischief with sic fals trane, And syne the same scho culd not lane Bot maid it kend fra hand. Throw hir malice and her Inuy Baith of hir husband and hir sell The cruell murther scho did out cry Quhair of nichtbouris had greit meruell. Quhilk thing thay neuer knew, Quhill that the wife it schew And causit hir the treuth to tell, How all the mater first befell And how the Knichtis thay slew. Quha was puneist for thair misdeid, And gat the rigour of the Law, Now Schirs persaue quhat dois proceid Of ane Ill womans wickit saw, Huredome was first in plane Syne gredynes but lane To wow the woman as ?e knaw. The gold and slauchter did on draw And causit the men be slane. Thairfoir I say thay that hes wyfes, Let thame not all thair secreitis knaw, For gif it chance that thay twa stryfes, All that scho knawis that will scho schaw. And rather mair nor les Thay haue that vse expres, For gif ?e len thame anis ane blaw Quyte auld freindschip thay let faw Turnis all to wickitnes. As did this wife in greit malice, Hir husband and hir self put doun, Throw hir counsall and couetice To hyde the same had na ressoun. That thing ?e wald haue hid, That to ?our wyfe forbid And it war neuer sa greit tressoun. That scho sall tell throw all the toun As this wickit wyfe did. The wyse man sayis thair toungis ar schairp As ony sword is wrocht with hand, Quhairwith sa crouslie thay will cairp Ilk word thay say alone sall stand. Thay ar sa outrageous, Irefull and dispittous, Thay cure not the wag of ane wand To gar ?ow tyne baith lyfe and land Quhen thay grow furious. God saue my self fra sic ane sort For I persaue thay ar perrellous I promeis ?ow it is na sport To find ?our vnfreind in ?our hous. Quhidder be he or scho, To tell all that I do And thay be bauld and busteous, Sa c?mersum and malitious, I can not tell quhairto. Ne intenderis malice mulieris quia nouissima illius amara quasi absintheum longe fac ab ea viam tuam quia lingua eius accuta vt gladius biceps. Et pedes eius discendunt in mortem. Prouerb. 5. Ane praise to the Sext Doctour. Thy goldin toung with grace sa thow hes gydit, That to this Chylde zit lyfe thow hes prouydit Contrair the Quene, a vengeance on hir cors Bot without dout or sentence be decydit, I wait the Chylde he will bauldlie abyde it. For quhy he knawis baith the best and the worse And gif sa be the Quene mon byde on force. Zit not the les thow suld haue thankis but dout Thow gude Maister that keipit thy day about. The Emprice seuint Taill. Befoir this time thair was ane Nobill King, That lufit his wife abone all eirdlie thing, He had to hir sic greit lufe and fauour, He keipit hir Ilk day within closour, In the greit hous of ane strenthie Castell, Quhairof the keyis he keipit ay him sell, Quhairat this Lady tuik greit heuines, That scho was sa haldin in sic straitnes. Wantit solace and all gude companie, Bot quhen the King come in allanerlie. In vther partis thair was ane Nobill Knicht, It chancit him to dreame into the nicht Into his sleip he thocht weill that he saw, The fairest Quene that euer man did knaw. Quhais lufe he couet abone all eirdlie thing, Gif he micht se hir on the eird walking. Nathing douting, bot be hir cum suld he To greit honour, worschip and honestie. That samin nicht this Quene in hir visioun Dreamit on this Knicht, and on the same fasso? And ?it nouther of vther knew the name, Nor knawledge had be fassoun or be fame. This Knicht he rais vpon the morne airlie, Rememberit weill on his dreame sickerlie. And determit into his minde and thocht, Nor be na way to tak rest wald he nocht: Vnto the time that Ladie quhill he fand, Gif that scho micht be gottin in ony land. Lap on his hors, and in haist furth he raid, To seik this Quene, na langer tary maid. Throw Royall Realmes, &amp; diuers greit co?treis Throw riche Regiounis, and semelie seir cieteis This fair Lady ?eid sa far in his thocht, Thair was na landis for hir he left vnsocht. Quhill at the last he come to ane Cietie, Quhair he gat wit thair was ane fair Ladie, Keipit sa clois, that nane micht cum hir till, Except alone it war the Kingis will. Thair he soiornd for his Pastime ane space, Him to refresche in mirth and mirrines. Sa it fortunit to him vpon ane day, Pas by the place quhair that this Lady lay. In hir windo luiking furth hir alone, For vther game, nor pastime gat scho none. Sa scho chancit sone for to get ane sicht, Quh?e of scho dremit of this same verray Knicht Thinking richt weill the samin man was he, Intill hir dreame befoir that scho did se. He not knawing that that Lady was thair. Bot as chance come doun by making repair. In meane seasoun he liftit vp his Ee In her windo this Lady can he se. Thinking richt weill it was the samin Quene, That he befoir into his dreame had sene. Than he began to sing ane sang of lufe, Quhilk quhen scho hard, greitlie it did hir mufe Into his lufe, and prentit in hir hart, Quhilk was vnkend to him in ony part. Zit not the les daylie he maid repair, About that place to tak pastime and air. Than this Lady persauing this at all, Ane bill of lufe to him scho leit doun fall. And he belyue red ouir this prettie bill, Persauing weill the Ladeis minde and will. Fra this time furth he vsit daylie Iusting, Breking of speiris, and alswa hors rinning. Casting of stane, and als the leidin mell, Worsling, lowping, he did exerce him sell, Daylie actis he vsit and honest deidis, That in the Court his fame &amp; word vp spreidis Quhill at the last his name and gude beiring, His honest actis war schawin to the King The King heiring his vail?eant tornament, He send for him Message Incontinent. Quha chargeit him the King he suld cum till, To heir his minde, his plesure and his will, Quha come to him with all humilitie, As him effeirit, law kneilling on his knie. Schir knicht he said, I haue hard of ?ow tell, How in gude actis ?e haue exercit ?our sell, Into my Court amang my gentill men, Thairfoir sen I sic actis dois of ?ow ken, Pleis ?e remane into our companie, Ze sall haue giftis and gude rewaird of me. And be ane of my gaird and my counsell, Sa it pleis ?ow with vs remane and dwell. Than said this Knicht and pleis ?our Maiestie, To haue seruice of sic ane man as me: I sall ?ow serue baith with my hand and hart, In all effairis, sic as pertenis my part, Without rewaird or ony recompence, Sa that I may haue daylie ?our presence. And sen ?our grace hes now desirit me, Into ?our gaird, and on ?our counsall be: I wald ?our grace to my desire wald grant, Sa on seruice the better I micht hant. Ane new ludgeing to haue at the Towre syde, Quhair I micht be, and at ?our bidding byde Gif that ?our grace neidit vpon me call, Ze micht gar cry out ouir the Castell wall. Than said the King faith I consent thairto, Ga big ?our hous as ?e think best to do. Than past the Knicht or euer he wald tire, And feit wark men, &amp; promeist thame gude hire His hous biggit with tymmer stane and thak, With ane Masoun he maid ane derne contrak. Out fra this hous to mak ane small passage, Into y? Towre quhair this Quene was in Cage Quhen this was done efter his awin Intent This same Masoun he killit Incontinent, That he suld not discouer his secre, For his rewaird this warkman this gat he. Than went this Knicht quh? he plesit to y? quene In secreit sort, and with na man was sene. Did hir seruice as culd him weill effeir, Than thay talkit of diuers maters seir. Amang the rest he spak to hir of lufe, Quhilk in ane part hir hart greitlie did mufe. Howbeit as than scho was not weill contentit, Zit efterwart to his will scho consentit. Sa in hir thocht the Quene kest on ane day, Of this mater quhat scho suld do or say: Tuitching this Knicht, als to hir awin husb?d Be sic thing knawin, than banisching the land To my tinsell, and euer warldis schame, For vpon me wald be laid all the blame. Becaus that I wald not the Knicht discure, I salbe callit the Ill woman full sure. Also the Knicht he sall eschaip na way, Bot of the deith the schairp he sall assay. Thairfoir is best, and I persaue my sell, To hald my toung, and not ane word to tell. And sa all times quhen thay pleisit to meit, Be this derne way thay ?eid to thair secreit. Sine efterward the Quene gaue him ane Ring Quhilk at wedlok scho ressauit fra the King. Greit Tornamentis this Knicht he vsit daylie And euer bure away the victorie. Quhairthrow he stude baith in Court &amp; with King In greit fauour, for his manlie hauing. Into sa far, that he was efterwart Maid be the King Comptroller and Stewart. And all his Realme he had in Regiment, Tuik in his maillis, Gersowmes &amp; daylie rent. Vpon a day it did appleis the King, For his plesure to pas to the hunting. To his Stewart the King gaue than command To be reddy, and pas with him fra hand. Vpon the morne than all the Court vprais, And with the king all to the Hunting gais. All the lang day thay chais in the Forest Quhill the king thocht he wald haue had s? rest For he was tyrit, and werie all begane, Sa he reposit beside ane fair Fontane. Than his Stewart quhair he sat with the king Efter trauell he fell vpon sleiping. And sa the king persauit at the last, The Quenis Ring vpon his finger fast. Quhilk the Knicht knew be countenance of the king That he had sene &amp; markit that Ilk ring. Than to the king with fen?eit countenance He said my Lord this is the verray chance. Ane Maladie hes tane me in this tyde. I am sa seik na mair hunting may byde. Without I get the soner sum remeid, I dout richt sair that it salbe my deid. Praying ?our grace that ?e wald giue me leif For to pas hame, ?our grace not for to greif. Quod he gude freind gif ?e pleis to pas hame I grant ?ow leif, pas on in Goddis Name. Incontinent he gat vpon his hors, Fen?eing him self to haue ane seiklie cors. Hame to his hous into all haist he raid, And to the Quene he past withouttin baid. Without proces deliuerit hir the Ring, That Scho befoir had gottin fra the king. And tald hir how the king the same did knaw On his finger, on sleip quhen he him saw. Beseiking hir gif that the kingis grace Speirit for the ring within schort time or space Scho suld him schaw the same but questioun For to exclude Ill word and suspitioun, This being done, he past his preuie way, And to his bed he maid him but delay. The hunting done, the King come hame at ene. Incontinent he said vnto the Quene, Quhair is the Ring in wedlok I ?ow gaue. Schaw me the same, for I it now mon haue. Scho said Lord, sa sone to quhat Intent Wald ?e it se, na way it is absent. Than said the King schaw me it Incontinent: Or I sweir ?ow ?e sall it sair repent. Than vp scho rais, and to hir Coffer went, And brocht the Ring to him Incontinent. Quhen he it saw, he was richt wonder glaid, And half aschamit vnto the Quene he said: Madame forsuith, sen first hour I was borne, Sa like ane Ring be warkmen maid or schorne. To the Knichtis Ring, to ?ouris I neuer saw, I wald haue sworne, war not y? now I knaw Baith had bene ane that gart me ask ?our Ring. Quod scho my Lord beleue ?e sic ane thing? Nay, nay, Madame, I cry ?ow now mercie, For weill I wait sic thing thair can not be. Scho said my Lord, tak not sic thing in thocht For the same man perchance y? ?our ring wrocht He maid the Knichtis, and on the samin sort. Quod he Madame I said it bot in sport. Quod scho my Lord God mot ?ow grant pardoun Gif ?e me in ony suspitioun. God ?ow forgiue ?our Ill suspitious minde, Gif ?e suspect in ony sort or kinde. Considdering of ?our Castell the strenth, And my lawtie ?e haue kend at the lenth. And sine ?our self had the keyis in keiping, I meruell how ?e can suspect sic thing. Quod he Madame I pray ?ow tak patience, I said nathing for to do ?ow offence. Bot as ?e knaw desirit my Ring to se, Quhilk now agane ?e sall ressaue of me. With als gude will as euer I it gaue, Scho said my Lord the same I will ressaue, Sa efterwart ?e suspect me na way, He said Madame, that sall I not perfay. Efter this time the Knicht causit prepair In his awin hous ane Banket or dennair. Sine to the King he said and pleis ?our grace, This is the treuth, the verray caus and cace, My bedfellow is cum fra hir countrie, Quhilk thocht greit lang my presence for to se, To hir I causit ane dennar to prepair, With all my hart I wald ?our grace war thair And pleis ?our grace to do me sic honour. Surelie (said he) I will do ?ow plesour. In that behalf, and it war mekill moir, The Knicht he kneillit, &amp; thankit him thairfoir Than in his hart he was richt wonder glaid For the kinde wordis the King had to him said. Than past he to the Quene Incontinent, Be his derne Caif, the straicht way is he went, And said Madame, pleis ?ow to tak sic pane, Into my hous to dine with ?our Souerane This samin day, and cleith ?ow vp richelie, As is the gise and vse of my countrie, And sit thairat in Tabill with the King, Euin as ?e war my wife spousit with ane Ring And mak him all the pastime and gude cheir. As to his grace in best sort can effeir. Scho said Schir Knicht as ?e pleis sa I will, As I best can ?our plesour to fulfill. The hour become, and dennar time of day, To the Knichts hous the King come on away. In the meane time the Quene come hir dern gait In the Knichts hall beliue scho gat hir sait. In sic clething as the Knicht gaue command, Efter the gise and fassoun of his land. And quhen the King come to the Knichtis haw, Sa sone as he the Ladeis visage saw, He thocht scho was wom? maist like his quene, Sen he was borne, that euer he saw with Ene. Zit not the les Ilk ane on thair maneir, Thay hailsit vther as it culd best effeir: Than to the Knicht the King said quietlie, Quhat is scho this sa semelie for to se? The Knicht he said, and pleis ?our Maiestie. This is forsuith my lufe and my Ladie, Quhilk of lang time fra me has bene absent, Bot now I am of hir c?ming content, Sa that ?e be content that scho is heir, I am (said he) sa God grant me gude cheir. And first thay wesche, and sine to Tabill went, And euir mair the King in his Intent, Thocht y? he knew the Quene &amp; had knawledge Be hir fassoun, hir forme and hir visage, And to him self he said in all his life, He neuer saw ane woman mair like his wife. Zit not the les the strenth of his awin Towre Dissauit his minde, and led him in errour, That in sa far he gaue far mair credence To the Knichtis wordis, and cullourit eloqu?ce Nor to the thing he saw with his awin Ene, Quhilk blindit him, &amp; als misknew his Quene Than scho began to talk of sum glaidnes, And steir the King vp in sum mirrines. Sa sone as he hard hir speiche and hir voice, Quhidder to speik or for to hald him clois. He not weill wist, bot ?it said to him sell, O Lord in heuin heir is ane greit meruell. This woman is in fassoun and fauour In speiche, in voice, makdome and portratour, In behauingis, and als in conditiounis, In fax, in face, in fait and in fassounis. And in all sort sa done like my awin Quene, In all this warld was neuer ane liker sene. And ?it the strenth of the Towre him begylit, With the Knichtis wordis y? him sa slelie sylit. Sa at the meit with mirrines amang, The Knicht desirit the Quene to sing ane sang. Than scho began to sing ane sang of lufe, The King heiring, greitlie his hart can mufe. Said to him self, and this be not my wife, I wait scho is not leuand vpon life. And than agane he thocht that can not be, For I my self in keiping hes the kie: Of the greit Towre, quhair nathing can cum in Bot I my self that keipis baith key and gin, Than na man can enter within that Towre, Except myself, nouther be time nor hour. Sa all denner he sat in sic consait, With his awin self into sic strang debait. And sa he sat, and wist not quhat to say, And at the last he bad sone tak away, The Tabill and claith, he wald na langer byde And said he wald about the feildis ryde. Than said the Knicht &amp; pleis ?our Nobill grace For to remane ane prettie time and space. We sall ?ow mak mair mirrines and cheir, For without dout ?our grace is welcum heir. Than said the Quene, and pleis ?our Maiestie, For to remane with vs in companie. We sall ?ow mak the mirrines and sport, All that we can to hald ?ow in comfort. Siclike as dois the Quene in hir solace, With all seruice that we can do ?our grace. For all requeist, planelie the King said nay, For to remane, gart tak the Tabill away. And said he was in that same verray tyde In sic fantise, he micht na langer byde. And sa the claith and Tabill away was tane, Vp rais the King and to the flure is gane. Thankit the Knicht of his kindnes and cheir, The Lady als into hir best maneir. Sine in all haist to the Castell he went, To se the Quene, gif scho was thair present. And than the Quene went on hir preuie way, Kest of hir clais and hir vncouth array. And quhen the King enterit within the Towre He fand the Quene sitting intill hir Bowre. In the same clais, and sort as he hir left, Quhairthrow he was in his speiche half bereft Quhen he hir saw he braist hir twise or thrise, And said Madame I am in ane fantise. This day I dynit with the Knicht as ?e knaw And with his lufe, the quhilk I neuer saw, Sa like to ?ow be forme and fassoun Be speiche and voice, and als condition. All dennar time I was sa steirit in thocht, That I not wist gif it was ?e or nocht. And ay my minde it was in sic dispair, I wist not weill gif ?e war heir or thair. Than said the Quene I meruell of ?our minde, That to sic thing ?our hart suld be Inclinde. For ?e knaw weil the greit strenth of ?our towre As to the keyis thay ar at ?our plesour. And my bodie ?e knaw hes na credence, To cum or gang without ?our awin licence. And as ?e knaw to fle I haue na wingis, How can ?e then Imagine siclike thingis? Quhat kinde of way is possibill to me, For to be in ?one Knichtis companie? Gif euer ?e red the buik of Phisnomy Thairin ?e may richt weill reid and espy That it may stand ane to be like ane vther. Howbeit that ane be not syb to the vther. Thairfoir my Lord I ?ow require on richt Haue na suspect betuix me and ?one Knicht. Than said the King forsuith that sall not be, I grant my self into this fault gyltie. Into sa far as I misdemit ?ow, Thair is na caus sic thing to think I trow. Than said the Quene sen gyltie ?e ?ow grant, I ?ow forgiue, sa sic thing ?e not hant. Vpon the morne the Knicht said to the King And pleis ?our grace ?e will me grant a thing. This lang ago I haue ?ow done seruice, The best I culd, pertening my office. Ze se my lufe is cum from hir countrie, And to returne hamewart for to caus me. And I Intend (gif it be ?our plesour Vnto my lufe ?e wald do sic honour, To mary hir in face of halie Kirk, As God commandis all Christin men to wirk) To be at hame callit my lauchfull wife, Quhill dowesum deid depart vs fra this life. Beseiking now ?our Nobill grace heirfoir, For my rewaird, as now I ask no moir: Bot with ?our hand deliuer hir to me, Befoir the Preist, that the pepill may se. It will be callit to me ane greit honour. Sa that it be ?our graces awin plesour. Quhair that my wife was geuin me be a King, In our countrie will be callit ane greit thing In sic effairis, as is the auld fassoun, Vnto wedlok, quhen twasum makis th? boun Than said the King, ?our rewaird is to small, That ?e desire or charges me with all. I will do that richt glaidlie for ?our saik, And for hir lufe that now suld be ?our maik. The Knicht thankit the King a thousand syse, That answerit him sa kindlie on sic wise. The mariage and day of the banket, The King him self he gart deuise and set. On the quhilk day, the King with greit honour Come to the Kirk to do the Knicht plesour. The parische Preist with his Kirklike vestm?ts, Was weill Indewit with all abil?ements, For to solempne the band of mariage, Into the Kirk, as than was the vsage. In this meane time the Knicht gart mak reddy In his awin hous his lufe and his Lady, Weill all cled vp efter the conswetude Of his co?trie quhilk he thocht was maist gude And gart twa Knichtis to the Kirk hir conuoy With greit blyithnes, solempnitie and Ioy. Quha than beleuit his Paramouris had bene, Howbeit scho was in deid thair natiue Quene. Than said the Preist the quhilk was his dewtie Quha delyueris this woman now to me? That I agane may gif hir to this Knicht, In face of Kirk, and in the pepillis sicht. Than said the King that sall I do bedene, Becaus scho is sa wonder like my Quene. I lufe hir all the better be my life, Hir face and fauour is sa done like my wife. As is the vse in filling of sic bandis The King he tuik his awin wife be the handis, And to the Preist he gaue this Lady bricht, The Preist agane gaue hir vnto the Knicht. Of halie Kirk, efter the auld fassoun, Than he began to reid his Orisoun, Vpon his buik full besilie can say, The band c?pleit he maid betwene thame tway. This being done the Knicht said to the King Schir ?e haue done to me ane kindelie thing. With ?our awin hand that hes deliuerit me This Nobill woman befoir this companie. My Schip quhairin we purpois to pas hame, Is alreddy now fleting on the fame. And we wald fane with ?our graces licence We war furderit hamewart for to pas hence. My Marinaris thay ar in reddynes, To tak vp saillis, and to the sey thame dres. Thairfoir I wald ?our Nobill Maiestie Sen ?e haue schawin sa greit kindnes to me, Vnto my Schip ?e wald my wife conuoy, For scho thairof wald haue greit mirth and Ioy Considdering scho is now to depart, It wald hir do greit comfort in hir hart. And als I wald ?e gaue hir gude counsall All man leuand for to forsaik all haill Bot me alone, quhilk is hir awin trew Knicht, And maryit hir into ?our graces sicht. Than said the King all sic is richt godlie, The maryit wife obedient to be: To hir husband, and all vthers refuse, I haue na dout bot all sic scho will vse. Than went the King with all his companie, And to the Schip conuoyit that fair Ladie. And be the gait his counsall he hir schew, That scho suld be to hir Knicht traist and trew. Him to obey, and hald him in honour, Lufe him alone abone all creature. And nane leuand in hir minde for to haue, Quhais counsall than I traist scho did ressaue. Than the Quene said and pleis ?our Maiestie This gude counsall that ?e haue geuin to me It salbe done, and it war ten times moir, Quod he Madame, now I thank ?ow thairfoir Praying to God ?our schip weill to conuoy, Swa to ?our land that ?e may cum with Ioy. And than he tuik the Quene first be the hand And sine the Knicht, quhilk th? was hir husb?d And gaue th? baith his blissing quhair he stude quhilk to y? Quene as scho thocht was richt gude For at that time scho thocht it was hir part, Howbeit this King was blindit to the hart. Sine first the Quene, &amp; than this nobill Knicht At this blind King ather that tuik gude nicht The King hir kist, and bad fair weill adew, Sa like my wife (quod he) I neuer knew. And hir fauour will caus me think on ?ow Quhen ?e ar past, this trewlie ?e may trow. Than said the Quene law kneilland on hir kne I thank ?our grace that sic thocht takis on me. Do I not sa quhen that we ar cum hame. And think on ?ow, richt far I am to blame. For greit kindnes and Inwart courtasie That ?e haif schawin to ?our awin knicht &amp; me This being done, to schip thay mak passage Enterit in burde, and maid for thair veyage. Raisit vp Ankeris, and Cabillis in thay drew, The wind was fair, euin as thay wald it blew Heisit vp saillis, and to seward thay past, The Skipper speillit belyue to the top Mast. To spy the wedder, gif tempest did appeir, Into that cace thair saillis the lawer beir. Within schort space the schip was out of sicht, Sa was the King baith quite of quene &amp; knicht And than belyue the King hamewart he went, To his Castell, and fand the Quene absent. Gif he was noyit or crabit at his hart, I trow be few of sturt can tell his part. His face it swat, his feit and handis schuik, Vpon na man with patience he micht luik. He socht the towre and spyit all round about, Gif he culd find the gait quhair scho gat out. He fand the hoill and secreit way at last, Quhair y? Knicht come &amp; quhair away scho past. Than cryit he out full wallaway allace, Heir is becum ane greit mischeuous cace. The Knicht quhome to I gaue sic confidence Of lufe and fauour, be counsall and credence. On him alone I wald haue lippinnit my life, Now tratourlie hes tane away my wife. I was ane fule fulfillit of fantasie, That gaue mair faith vnto his wordis slie: Nor I did ay to my awin seing Ene, Quhairthrow I want my bedfellow and quene And schamit for ay with lak and derisioun, Quhilk will me bring to vtter confusioun. Considdering weill I had my Ene to se, All men may weill exampill tak be me. The Emprice than said to the Empreour This taill I tald my Lord for ?our plesour. Wald God the same that ?e weill vnderstude, Than suld ?e be of all danger denude. The Empreour said Madame sa haue I seill, All that ?e said I vnderstude richt weill. Quod scho my Lord rem?ber how this Prence Vnto this Knicht gaue sic perfite credence. Als to his wordis greiter credence he gaue, Nor his awin Ene, sa he did him dissaue. In like maner vnto thir Maisters seuin, Ze giue mair faith nor to greit God in heuin Be apperance, for daylie ?e may se Quhat displesure thay seuin wald wirk on me. Me to destroy thay labour nicht and day, And ?e giue faith to Ilk word that thay say, Mair nor ?e do to ?our awin naturall Ene, Quhilk heirefter will baith be hard and sene. Haue ?e nocht sene how ?our sone raif my face, And ?it ?e giue skarse credence in that cace. Quhilk ?it beiris still the markis as ?e may se. Quhairof as ?it I get na remedie. And als ?e knaw how me he wald haue schamit Defoulit ?our bed, quhairthrow I was defamit All this become throw his Maisteris defence Quhome to ?e giue sa confirmit credence. This ?e mark not, nor prentis into ?our hart, Bot it noyis me Inwart in euerie part. Thairfoir richt sair I dout the samin thing Sall happin ?ow, as it did to this King. That gaue credence quhill he was quite begylit Sa is ?our self with thir same seuin ouirsylit. He said I giue to my Eine mair credence, Nor to thay seuin for all thair greit Science. Thairfoir the morne for all thair taillis &amp; sawis My sone he sall the Iudgement thoill of lawis And on the morne his officers he gart call, Commandit them that thay suld furthwith all Tak out his Sone, and on the Gallous hing, That it war done befoir all vther thing. Than sic ane noyis rais vp in the Cietie, It for to heir it was ane greit pietie: That the Empreour his awin sone suld gar sla, Within that toun mony hart it maid wa. The seuint Maister hard tell of this tythand, To the Sergands he haistit him fra hand. Thame for to meit in all gude haist him sped, Quhair thay y? childe doun throw the Cietie led Quod he gude freinds, hartlie I ?ow beseik, Tary ane time quhill I the Empreour speik. I traist to God or I cum far away. I sall his life fra perrell saue this day. The Officers thay war richt wonder glaid, And did euin sa, as the Maister thame bad. To the Empreour he haistit throw the toun, And on his kneis befoir him sat he doun: Randering him sic reuerence as accordis, Sine efter him to his Princes and Lordis. The Empreour with greit Indignatioun, Vengeabill vult, and with browis casting doun Saying to him all sorrow mot the fall, Baith vnto the, and to thy fellowis all. Ane dum ?oung chylde to me ?e seuin hes sent, Quhilk spak richt weill quh? he vnto ?ow went Becaus ?e seuin hes send me sic ane hidder, He and ?e all salbe hangit togidder. The Maister said, and pleis ?our nobill grace Fra now to morne it is bot ane schort space: And than be none with grace of God in heuin, Zour sone sall speik, and we his Maisteris seuin Vnto ?our grace we promittis faithfullie, On pane of deith, first we all seuin sine he. The Empreour said, gif I micht that beleue, Na langer than desirit I for to leue. The Maister said, I pray ?ow byde sa lang, And gif we faill, all aucht ?e sall vs hang. Than oppinlie ?e sall ken all the strife And discentioun, betuix vs and ?our wife. And gif ?our grace will not do as I say, Ze will repent richt sair ane vther day. And sall happin perchance to ?ow sum nicht, As it bechancit to ane richt courtes Knicht: That deit schortlie, as I in storie reid, For ane small blude that he saw his wife bleid. To quhome efter scho was richt vncourtes, And richt vnkinde, for all his greit kindnes. The Empreour said Maister I ?ow requeir Tell me that taill, richt fane I wald it heir. The Maister said gar call ?our sone agane The haill storie I sall tell ?ow in plane. In time c?ming Induring all ?our life Ze sall eschew the schrewitnes of ane wife. The Empreour said I will call him agane, Conditionallie vnder the samin pane. The morne or none speik he not oppinlie, First he, sine ?e, togidder all sall die. The Maister said of that I am content. The Empreour said and thairto I consent, Than causit he to call the Childe agane, And the Maister tald furth his taill in plane. Bot the Quenes last taill ?it farther or we ga We will persaue, or we tell ony ma. Moralitas. Into this taill richt small I can persaue To be extract of Morall gude sentence, Bot that this Knicht subtellie did dissaue This Nobill King that gaue him sic credence In sindrie sortis schew him beneuolence. Syne he agane vpon the vther syde, With greit falset did all his wayis prouyde. As to our Quene, quhair scho Inferris this taill To hir purpois, and to hir awin effairis. As thinkis me, the mater ryndes haill To hir awin schame, as the taill self declairis. For to tell furth planelie scho not spairis And to reheirs the huredome that was hid Betuix the Knicht and the Quene that thay did. Considdering that thay ar Quenes baith. Quha can hir quyte sic ane mater on bring Gif ane hes schame it is the vtheris skaith, For to be fals to hir husband and King, Trow ?e bot our Emprice can do sic thing In deid I trow or all our buik be endit ?e sall persaue als far scho hes offendit. Gif ane Doctour into his sermon tell, And reprufe vice, greit faultis or greit errour In the same vice he is gyltie him sell How sall he snib that vice with his honour? He smottis him self as he dois his Nichtbour Alwayis vpon his awin blanket he spittis, And his awin taill hard on the heillis him hittis. Of my Nichtbour gif I ane Ill taill tell Of blasphemie, dishonour, or ?it schame, it may perchance siclyke cum to my sell Perhappin war, bringing on als greit blame. How can I than in ony sort defame My awin Nichtbour, except my self be clene Sic thing suld be considderit and weill sene. Our awin Emprice quhome of that we now speik Scho put reproche vnto ane vther Quene, Bot scho may cast hir Cartis in at the Cleik Of the same sort, thocht now sic be not sene As Mathew sayis, euin sa as now I mene. Fra thy awin Ey first thow draw out the balk To thy Nichtbour than peirtly thow may talk. Thairfoir I say thow had neid for to se Or thow ane fault vnto thy Nichtbour fand, Of siclyke faultis se thow weill purgeit be Him to reprufe or that thow tak on hand Ellis thy reprufe with honour can not stand, It to obey thair is few will be abill Gif thow be kend in that same culpabill. How can our Quene sa foull ane fault Infer Contrair ane Quene, and scho hir self gyltie In the same cryme, ?ea, and perchance far war Howbeit it be cloikit mair quyetlie, Fy on falset, fy on hid harlatrie, That ane Ill taill of thy nichtbour can tell, And that same taill redoundis euin to thy sell. Ane reproche to the Emprice. Thow glaikit gallarrand quene, now with thy glorious glois With thy fals taillis of tene, thow trowis to win the hois. Nay, nay, not sa my Iois, thairs zit sum graith to find Ane prick into zour nois, or we haue done behind, Trow ze to blaw vs blind, thairs vther taillis to tell Quhen stabilit is all this wind, luik than quha beiris the bell: The wraik sall on thy sell, baith the sorow and syte, Thow Proserpine of hell, we cure the not ane myte For all thy greit dispyte, hid ouir with harlatrie Full weill we sall the quyte, that all the warld may se. Thow bysemeir balamie, thy hippis sall thoill het haisteris, For thow seruis thame trewlie, at the Chylde and his Maisteris. The Taill of the Seuint Maister is how the man deit becaus he saw his Wyfes fynger bleid. Vpon a time thair was ane Nobill Knicht, That had ane wife y? was baith fair &amp; bricht Quhome he sa lufit, that be na way he micht Of the haill day ane hour want hir of sicht. Vpon a time after meit and glaidnes, For thair pastime thir twa went to the Ches. And in his hand it happinnit him to haif His awin byknife, and sa amang the laif Thairon scho straik hir hand a litill we Amaist ane drop of blude that ?e micht se. Sa sone as he the blude saw of his wife, Alwayis he said, that scho wald lois hir life. Befoir thame all, amang thame fell he doun, For verray wo into ane deidlie swoun. Incontinent than scho began to cast Vpon his face cauld water wonder fast. Than he ouircome within ane litill space, The cald watter thay wap sa in his face. The Minister he gart call of the toun. And prayit him to heir his Confessioun. For weill he knew without ony remeid, Thair was nathing at him bot onlie deid. For na seiknes, nor for nane vther deid Bot onlie saw his wifes finger bleid. The Minister exhortit him anone, And sone efter to deith this Knicht is gone. For quhome thair was greit sturt &amp; beuailling, Amang the rest his wife maid maist murning. The Buriall with greit solempnitie, Was maid and done in best maner micht be. Than this Lady scho maid ane solempne vow, To leif ay still as dois the Trytill Dow. All hir life time to leif in Chastitie, And neuer to knaw ony mannis companie: Bot ay ly still abone hir husbandis graue, And neuer mair warldlie comfort to haue. Bot euer murne vnto the day scho die, In the same graue quhill that scho buryit be. Hir freindis say nay, that was not all the best, Sen it pleisit God hir husband was at rest: Bad hir pas hame, and cast hir to defend Hir hous &amp; barnis, to murne wald nathing m?d Giue to the pure, and let the deid hyne ga, We think it best (quod thay) that ?e do sa. We sall ?ow do all comfort that we can, Sine efterwart to cheis ?ow ane new man. Cast ?ow to mirth, and let ?our murning be, For naturall is, that all men anis mon die. Scho said counsall of ?ow nane will I haue, For I sall die widow abone this graue. Can ?e not all considder for my sake, Sic sair seiknes, and doly deith did take For ane small drop he saw my finger bleid, Suld I not than baith into word and deid On my persoun sum pennance for to take, The cruell deith that sufferit for my sake. Thairfoir gude freinds let put ?our minde to rest For in this graue salbe my ludge and rest Quhill God sinder my saull and life in tway, Thairfoir my freinds fra me pas hame away. Than hir neir freinds heiring hir vtter minde, Thocht in s? part thay wald with hir Inclinde Becaus scho was in sturt and greit dolour, Thay wald sum way cast thame to hir plesour. And saw scho wald do nathing bot hir will, Thairfoir thay thocht the same for to fulfill. And causit to big euin at the graues syde, Ane proper ludge quhairin that scho micht byde And furneis hir all necessaris thairto, In all effairis, or quhat scho had ado. Beleuing weill scho wald change hir Intent, And efterwart to wirk with freinds consent. Thinking richt weill y? scho na way wald w?t Sicht of pepill, bot scho thairto wald hant. Sa thay hir left into hir quiet Caif, Murning richt sair abone hir husbandis graif. Thair was a Law than maid in the Cietie, Gif ony man was condampnit to die On the Gallous, for trespas and vnricht, Than the Schiref suld walk him all that nicht In his harnes, the morne quhill it war day, Sa that the theif suld not be stollin away. And gif sa war, the Schiref to tine his land, And als his life to be in the Kings hand. In this meane time it happinnit that thair was Ane man hangit for his thift and trespas. Than the Schiref behude that nicht on force All in armour to walk that hangit cors, And sa he did, howbeit the nicht was cald, Quhair he watchit thair was na hous nor hald It chancit that nicht to be baith wind and rane That in na sort thairout he micht remane: For verray cauld, he stude of life sic dout, And sa belyue he blenkit him about: In the Kirk?aird beside the Knichtis graue, Ane litill licht the Schiref can persaue, Fra the windo quhair that the Wedow lay, Hidder he gais in all the haist he may. At the ludge dure he knokit quietlie, And sone scho spak, and speirit quha may that be. This time of nicht to walkin ane pure Wedow All wobegane, in hart richt sorrofow. He said I am the Schiref of this toun, For verray cauld I am in point of swoun: Except ?e let me in mair haistelie, For verray cauld doutles I trow to die. Gif ?e cum in (quod scho) I feir richt sair That ?e sall eik my anguische mair and mair. Quhilk war neidles schir gif ?e knew my thocht Quod he Lady, forsuith that sall I nocht. I promeis ?ow nouther in word nor deid Zow for to craib, thairfoir haue ?e na dreid. Than vp scho rais, and belyue leit him in, For verray cauld he cheuerit at the chin. And doun he sat, and warmit him at the fire, Quhilk for to do was greitlie his desire. Fra he was warmit and restit thair ane space, Graithlie he blent into the Wedowis face. Quod he Lady to displeis ?ow na way, Ane word with leif I wald vnto ?ow say. Scho said gude schir say on quhat euer ?e pleis For ?our sayingis sall do me na diseis. He said Lady I meruell of ?our minde. To this vane wark that ?e suld ?ow Inclinde, Considdering ?e ar ane fair Ladie, Fresche in ?our flouris, ?o?g plesand and lustie, It war mair meit, and better be ten fald, For to pas hame and keip ?our awin houshald. Nor heir to byde, and ?our self to destroy, Daylie in sturt, in murning and in noy. My counsall is pas hame to ?our awin hous, Giue to the pure, and gar deill greit Almous. Quod scho gude schir, gif I ?our wordis had knawin Or y? ?e suld sic sayings to me schawin Ze suld not had into this hous entrie, Becaus ?e talk of sic purpois to me. I say to ?ow as I said of befoir, To all my freindis, and I wald ?e no moir Spak of sic thingis, thay sink not in my heid, Knaw ?e not weill my husband sufferit deid: For ane small drop he saw my finger bleid, Than think ?e not that I suld do sum deid. For him agane, and tak sum small pennance, That micht me caus of him haue remembrance Thairfoir I sall him lufe on sic ane wise, That I mon lufe the eird quhair that he lyis. And for his saik sic pennance tak on me, That quhair he lyis abone him sall I die. Than the Schiref tuik leif and vp he rais, The neirest gait vnto the Gallous gais. And quhen he come the theif that he left thair, Was stollin away, quhairof he maid greit cair. And said oft times, quhat haue I done allace, Heir is to me becum ane cairfull cace. My gudis, my geir, and also all my land My life siclike is in the Kingis hand. Sa he wandring in sturt baith to and fro And wist not quhat to do for verray wo. Sa at the last he thocht that he wald pas To the Lady, befoir quhair that he was. Becaus scho was sa deuoit in hir sell, He trowit of hir to haue sum gude counsell. Than come he on as had bene the first Cok, And at the dure quietlie did he knok. Quod scho quha is that, that sa sone callis now I the Schiref is cum agane to ?ow. I haue ane sturt and anger at mine hart, And I wald schaw thairof to ?ow sum part. Thairfoir hartlie I pray ?ow let me in, I sall ?ow schaw the mater mair and min. Howbeit it was to hir sum prettie pane, Zit vp scho rais and leit him in agane. Than he began the cace all for to tell, Quod he Lady I come to haue counsell Of ?ow, becaus I wait richt weill ?e knaw, Quhen ony man is hangit be the Law, My office is to keip him nicht and day, To that effect he be not stollin away. And gif he be, my life and all my landis Without remeid, is in the Kingis handis. It is sa chancit quhen I was heir richt now In the same time quhen I talkit with ?ow, The theif quhilk I suld haue walkit quhill day Sum subtell handis hes stollin him quite away Quhairthrow I will Incur the Kingis feid, Lois all my landis, and also tine my heid. Or ellis on force furth of the Realme to fle Quhilk is but dout ane heuie cace to me. Beseiking ?ow ?our counsall giue me to Into this cace quhat ?e think best to do. Quod scho gude Schir for ?ow my hart is wo. That sic ane chance suld happin vpon ?ow so. Bot sen ?e haue maid ?our first mane to me. I mon ?ow help, defend and als supplie. Sa wald kindnes, courtasie and ressoun, Of ane wo hart for to haue compassioun. Quod he Lady I lippin on ?ow na les, Bot for to haue ?our counsall and kindnes. Becaus ?e ar in greit estimatioun, In wit, wisdome, and als in deuotioun. And I beleue to haue ?our counsall now For all my caus clene I commit to ?ow. For it is said sen first the warld began, Thair is greit help into ane gude woman. This Lady than was mufit with mercie, And on this Knicht hir hart had greit pietie, and said gude Schir ?our sturt it mufis me, Bot tak gude hart, and ?e sall helpit be. Do my counsall, and schortlie to conclude Ze sall nouther lois ?our life landis nor gude. He said Lady that erand brocht me heir, To saue my life, my landis, my gudis and geir Quod scho Schir will ?e promeis faithfullie, Quhen I haue done, that ?e will Mary me: I will do all that I haue to ?ow said: Quod he Lady of that I wald be glaid. Wald God in heuin to me ?e wald sa do, That I micht be ?our persoun fallowis to, Considdering I am bot ane pure Knicht And ?e ane Lady of greit blude and of micht. Wald ?e disdane to humbill ?our minde to me, I suld ?ow serue with all humilitie. Sa baith thair mindes and all thair hail Int?t Was weill aggreit, quhairof thay stude content Gude schir scho said, ?e knaw richt weil I wait How my husband was buryit of the lait, Quha lufit me sa wonder weill in deid: That for ane drop he saw my finger bleid: He tuik in hart sic sturt and displesour Of doly deith he sufferit the scharp schour. Ga tak him vp for to be ?our releif, And hang him vp quhair hangit was the theif The Schiref said fair Lady be the Rude Zour counsall is substantious and gude. Than past thay baith bauldlie w? mane &amp; micht Furth of the graue that drew y? new deid knicht The Schiref said ?it ane thing feiris me, The theif quhilk I gart hing vpon the tre, Twa of his teith abone was strikkin out, Thairfoir I stand into ane dreidfull dout: Gif ony man the samin suld persaue, That this deid Cors his ouir teith dois haue, It war my deith, and callit greit dissait, Thairfoir to do, heirof not weill I wait. Scho said ?our self may richt weill that remeid I giue ?ow leif, strike thre out of his heid. Quod he Lady to that I war richt laith, For of Knichtheid it is aganis the aith. Outher ?oldin or deid man for to strike, It wald greitlie baith faith and fame Infek, And als quhen he was leuand heir on life, Except onlie my barnis and weddit wife: I lude him best of ony man leuand, Thairfoir in him I can not put my hand. Gif ?e will not now ding thame out said scho Faith for ?our lufe that same thing I will do. Sa with ane stane twa of his teith out dang. Sine bad the Schiref hing him quhair the theif hang. The schiref said ?it I feir a greit thing, The theif quhilk I on the Gallous gart hing Ane hiddeous wound he gat in his foirheid At his taking, thay had at him sic feid. And baith his luggis thay stowit quite him fra And ?our husband be he not euin richt sa It suld be my destructioun haistelie, In this mater I pray ?ow counsall me. Amang the rest (quod scho) thats bot ane bourd Can not ?our self peirtlie draw out ?our sword, On the foirheid strike him as best effeiris, Quhen that is done, than cut of baith his eiris. Quod he Lady fra that God me defend, Considdering vnto his lifes end I lude sa weill, and had in companie, In that behalf I pray ?ow pardoun me. And of befoir I did to ?ow declair Of clene Knichtheid the aith it is contrair. Giue me the sword (quod scho) and for ?our lufe That same to do now peirtlie sall I prufe. Scho tuik the sword, and to the man was deid Ane cruell straik scho gaue him in the heid: With the same sword into hir greit dispite Of baith his luggis belyue scho maid him quite Sine said gude schir now ?e may without tary But ony feir him to the Gallous cary. And hing him vp quhair the theif hang befoir, Sa ar ?e quite of danger, sturt and schoir. Th? said the schiref ?it ane thing restis in thocht Thairof quhill now remembrance had I nocht Howbeit the theif was haill in bowk and banis Zit weill I wait he wantit baith his stanis. And be that kend, all is for nocht thats done Quod scho in faith the stanis he sall want sone. And with ane knife the stanis scho tuik him fra And said gude Schir now to the treis him ta. He c?meris vs for to byde sa lang heir, Quod he my self alone dow not him beir. Quod scho in faith for that it sall not stop Tak ?e the taill and I sall tak the top. For sen he come furth of his Sepulture I haue him maid ane laithlie creature. To the Gallous thir twa him tuik but moir, And hang him vp quhair the theif hang befoir. Than was the schiref of the Kingis d?ger quite Be the greit help of this Lady sa quhite. Than said scho schir, now wonder weil ?e knaw How that ?e war be ordour of the Law, Baith life and landis in danger for to tine, And now I haue brocht all to ane gude fine: Be my counsall and onlie for ?our lufe, For ?our plesure and als for ?our behufe. Quhairfoir sen ?e in all maters hes sped, Now I desire agane ?e wald me wed. Conforme to ?our conditioun and promis, Quhilk in na sort I wait ?e will not mis. He said Lady, forsuith I maid ane vow, That I suld not Mary woman bot ?ow: Sa lang as ?e war leuand vpon life, Bot wo to him that hes the to his wife. Thow schameles schrew, and maist wickit of all Tenefull tyger a vengeance on the fall. Ane Nobill Knicht thow had to thy husband, And for ane drop of blude furth of thy hand He had sic lufe and Inwart fauour to the, For sturt thairof at schort causit him to die. Thow in na way all his lufe regarding, His forder teith trewlie thow did out ding. In his foirheid ane fell wound did thow strike, Cuttit his luggis, and als his stanis siclike. Quhen I think on this vgsum vilanie, God me preserue that I not Mary the. And for that caus I find the sa cruell, To him alone that lufit the so well. In time c?ming thow can na better be, To ony man that wald lay lufe on the. Thairfoir I sall, that thow sall schame na ma In time c?ming, my awin handis sall the sla. And sa at schort he put hir thair to deid He drew his sword and quite straik of hir heid. The Maister said than to the Empreour, Schir I require gif it be ?our plesour: Gif that ?e haue the wordis of this taill tane The Empreour said ?e Maister euerie ane. Scho was ane wife the worst and maist cruell That I befoir of ony ?it hard tell. The Scherif als rewardit hir the thing, That scho deseruit, to hir deidis according. Zit gude Maister hartlie I ?ow beseik, That I may anis my Sone blyithlie heir speik For that wald mak sic blyithnes to my hart, Fra that time furth I cair not to depart. He said my Lord and pleis ?our Maiestie, That thing the morne ?e sall baith heir and se: At ?our plesure, as ?our self dois desire, In audience befoir the haill Impire. And sall knaw weill the caus of vnkind[n]es Betuix vs seuin, ?our sone and ?our Empres. The Empreour said gif that thing c?mis to pas Than ?our rewaird salbe quhat ?e will as. He said my Lord all is at ?our plesour, Sa tuik his leif than fra the Empreour. Moralitas. Into this taill that the Doctour hes tald We may persaue sentences monyfald Pertening to wemens vnstabilnes, First thair awin will to haue ay that thay wald, That gart hir big abone the graue ane hald For to mak knawin hir fen?eit halynes, Quhilk sone was turnit to babist brukilnes. Considder sine how that scho was sa bald In diuers sortis, and schew hir cruelnes. First scho hir schew to be in estimatioun, Ane chaist wedow, and leif in deuotioun In godly prayer, and into almous deid Quhilk sone was turnit in greit dissimulatioun Of hir awin spous that maid sic mutulatioun. Quha deit becaus he saw hir finger bleid, Quhat gaue scho him for his gude lufe and meid His stanis, his luggis, scho stowit, and teith out dang Sine on Gallous as ane theif did him hang. Heir is hir lufe, heir is hir stabilnes Heir is hir fauour, heir is hir faithfulnes Heir hir chaistnes, heir is hir Cheritie Hir courtasie, heir is all hir kyndnes, Hir womanheid, lo heir is hir meiknes, Heir is hir hope, heir is hir honestie, Heir is hir grace, heir is hir grauitie, Heir hir gansell, heir is all hir gudnes, Now all is changeit into kene crueltie. O meruellous God quhat may this mater mene That wemen ar sa cruell and sa kene, And euer geuin to wickitnes and vice In former time euer mair sa hes bene, And in na sort can ?it thairfoir abstene: Bot perseueiris, this is ane mater nice. I think it best to play thame at the dice The neirest way in this warld is I wene To saue thair schame, set thame on sink and sice. Quhair suld be faith, thair schaw thay fen?eitnes And quhair fauour thay schaw vnfaithfulnes, Quhair suld be rest, thay rattill ay in a rane, Quhair lufe suld be, thair schaw thay bitternes. Quhair peice suld be, thair schaw thay vp baldnes Quhair gudnes is, thair ludgeing haue thay nane Quhair tene and tray, that hous is to thame tane Quhair meiknes is, than thay ar mensles, O maryit men for ?ow I mak greit mane. For quhy ?our heidis ar still bound till ane staik, And thocht ?e do all ?e dow for hir saik As ?ow bec?mis baith into word and deid And sa daylie on hir seruice dois vaik, Scho countis not all ?our cunning worth a caik, Quhen euer scho craibis, and castis bakwart the Creid Euin as the Knicht saw his wyfes finger bleid, In lufis labour quhen euer that ?e Inlaik, All thing bygane scho countis not worth ane threid. Becaus thay ar sa kittill of the Came Quhylis lyke a wylde wolf quhylis as a Dow als tame, In at bosum, and sine out at ?our sleif. Sic saules thingis hes nouther sin nor schame, Than we do wrang ony way thame to blame Thay will do nocht that will thair husband greif Nor skantlie speik without he giue hir leif, Sic Innocentis that wait of nocht bot Ill Thay couet nocht bot ay to haue thair will. Sum makis sa moy, sa gymp, as dynk and dane Howbeit ?e speik scho will not blenk agane And gif scho do, it is out on the syde, That Fillok wald be at the feild als fane That semis ane Sanct new send vs fra Sathan Thocht scho be brawlit and buskit lyke ane bryde Vnder cullour scho is ane graceles gyde Ane fule fulfillit of fantasie prophane, Ane rank Rebald, reddy all tymes to ryde. ?e gude wemen exampill heir may se Be not fen?eit with fals Hypocrasie, In mennis sicht presenting ane Angell And sine Inwart satiat with subteltie, Fulfillit all with fraude and falsitie. All this bec?mis of the greit Deuill of hell Quha daylie settis his curage for to quell All mankynde with his kene crudelitie Sa wemen dois, as now na mair I tell. Ane praise to the Seuint Maister. Thow hes put of Doctour ane doutsum day, The seuint and last quhairin maist perrell lay. And sauit the Chylde vnto the morne quhill none Now in Goddis name let him cum on away To the Emprice, gif he hes ocht to say. To say it out, I think it war weill done For scho hes bene to him Inoportune, In his contrair scho hes done that scho may To gar him mis baith Denner and Disione. Ane Exclamatioun to the Chylde. Now sen thow speikis on hir thow wreik it weill Gif thow hes caus, thy self thow hes sum feill. Thank hir na mair, than thow had hangit bene, Gif thow hes hap now hit hir on the heill And spair hir nocht, thocht scho war stif as steill For scho hes bene to the richt wonder kene, Quhilk in na sort pertenit to ane Quene On sic ane wise a ?oung Clerk to gar keill Quha wrocht neuer to hir ?it tray nor tene. How Dioclesiane on the Emprice complenit, And him excusit of all maters scho menit. Efter that the seuin Maisters all about Had sauit this Chyld of all danger and dout Be gude ressounis, of storeis red and sene, Vpon the morne togidder did conuene To ane counsall, to se how weill thay micht Conuoy this Chylde vnto his Fathers sicht, And fra presoun how best thay suld him bring, All to consult thay past for the same thing. Sa to presoun thay come with ane consent To speik this Chyld befoir the none thay went His opinioun and counsall for to heir, Quhat he wantit that thay seuin suld him leir. Richt weill besene in honest Ornament, Of his Maisteris twasum befoir him went. And on Ilk syde of him Maisteris ?eid ane, And thre behind, and sa fordwart ar gane. And fourtene men in thair companie went Ilk ane playing on diuers Instrument. And euerie ane was Maister in Musick, For Melodie and mirth thair was nane sick. To the Palice this Chylde thay did conuoy, With greit blyithnes, mirth melodie and Ioy, Sa that the sound of all the Instrumentis And the greit noyis in at the windois wentis. Quhat was the noyis, the Empreour did dem?d Thay said it was his sone c?ming at hand, Vnto ?our grace, for to excuse him sell, Of part of plaintis, quhilk sum did to ?ow tell, The Empreour said thay tythandis lykis me, My sone speiking gif I micht heir or se. In the Palice this ?oung Chylde tuik entres Quhairof mony maid mirth and mirrines. And quhen he come to his Fatheris presence, He hailsit him with dewlie reuerence With honour fauour, and all humilitie, As him become, or culd of courtasie. The companie, and all about was glaid. With greit blyithnes to his Father he said. Hale Father deir, helth honour and weilfair Be to ?our grace, for now and euer mair. Sa sone as he of his sone hard the vois, Into his hart it did him sa reiois: That his greit lufe his wittis it did confound, That he for Ioy flatlingis fell to the ground. Than vp agane his sone tuik him in haist, And diuers times in his armes he him braist. Sa with sweit wordis and c?fortabill brasing Fra swoun agane he did his Father bring. Als sone fra swoun the Empreour did walk, The Chylde began to his Father to talk. Zit of pepill thair was sic confluence, The Chylde to speik micht scarse get audience. The Empreour he causit cassin be, Greit sowmes of gold out throw the hail Cietie To that effect to draw the pepill away, That he micht heir what th?g his sone wald say Of the money ?it sum tuik small regaird, That the yo?g man sa fane thay wald haif hard The Empreour he cryit giue audience, In pane of deith Ilk man to keip silence. Th? was all clois, to speik thair durst na man Sine for to speik Dioclesiane began. My Father deir humblie I ?ow beseik, That ?e will caus or I ma wordis speik, Zour awin Emprice with hir fair Ladeis gent At my sermon Ilk ane to be present. The Empreour Incontinent gaue command, That the Emprice suld hidder cum fra hand. With hir Ladeis of hir Chalmer Ilk ane, To hir belyue the Messinger is gane, And in all haist the Message tald hir till, And schew to hir the Empreouris minde &amp; will Scho heiring that scho tuik ane felloun feir, Was na remeid, bot all thay did compeir. Than did the Childe desire the Empreour, That all the Ladeis of the Emprice bour Suld stand on raw, Ilk ane at vtheris syde, In pane of deith that nane thame self suld hyde That the pepill micht all thame planelie se Thair trim makdome, and als thair honestie. Thair fauour, yair face, yair fame &amp; yair fasso? Thair braue hauingis, and thair paintit perso? Vpon the deis thay damis quh? yai war dreuin Thay war maist like Angellis c? furth of heuin Thay war sa sweit s? said thay war all sanctis Trew men thame callit als trim as termigantis Than stude thay vp all into plane presence, And to the Childe gaue oppin audience. Than said the Childe Father lift vp ?our Ene, Behald how lang that ?e haue blindit bene With ?our Emprice that is ?our Maryit quene And that ?oung wenche that all is cled in grene Quhilk is bour Mayd vnto ?our awin Empres Quhome scho hes mair in fauour and kindnes, Than euer scho had I dar weill tak on me Sen thay first met than to ?our Maiestie. Quhome I desire gif it plesit ?our grace To be vncled befoir ?ow in this place. That being done, richt weill ?e sall persaue, Sic ane bour Mayd, and sic Emprice ?e haue. To quhome answerit this Nobill Empreour, Thow knawis sone it is not my honour, It will be schame to me and to vs all, Ane naikit Mayd befoir vs for to call. Than said the Chylde ane Maydin gif scho be All the greit schame thairof beis laid on me, Gif scho be not ane ?oung Mayd as ?e tell, Than let all schame remane still with hir sell. The Empreour than commandit that be done, The Officers thay vnbecled hir sone. The clais of tane, it weill appeirit than It was na Mayd, bot alwayis was a man. And be all signes of memberis naturall, Quhairof mony had wonder greit meruall. Than said the sone with all humilitie, The verray treuth now Father ?e may se, Of the falset, and the greit subtelnes Of this Rebald, and als of ?our Empres, How day and nicht hes ?ow in blindnes led, Quhen thay best thocht hes ay defoulit ?our bed In ?our Chalmer ay vsit sic harlatrie, Fornicatioun, Huredome, and Adulterie. Not regarding Goddis Law nor conscience Nor ?our dreddour, ?our lufe and reuerence: Bot euer mair thair lust and thair plesour, Tuik quhen thay list, to ?our greit dishonour. Quhen the Empreour saw all the veritie How this ?oung man was clad as ane Ladie, And vsit nichtlie in Chalmer with the Quene, For verray wraith, Impatience and tene His Ene thay glowrit, and als his face it swellit His greit anger thair is na man can tell it. He commandit thame baith Incontinent Without mercie to be condampnit and brint. Than said the sone Father remane a time, Quhill I reprufe hir of the cruell crime Scho laid on me, and falslie on me brocht, The thing yat I had neuer in minde nor thocht The Father said that thing and all the rest Is in ?our handis, do with it as ?e think best. Than said the sone, ane lier gif scho be, Than let the Law correct hir for hir lie. Bot ?e sall knaw quhen ?e first for me sent, My self I past and spyit the Firmament. Quhairin I saw, ane word gif that I spak Within seuin dayis, that I with schame &amp; lak Suld thoill the deith with all greit crueltie Be ony way that culd deuisit be. And that alone be the greit foirthocht feid Of the Emprice, Imagining my deid. That was the caus Father I durst not speik, Thairfoir pardoun at ?ow now heir I seik. And quhair scho sayis that I wald hir opprest That is in treuth ane lesing manifest. Bot trewlie scho did all that in hir was In all kin sort to bring that thing to pas. And quhen scho saw that I refusit sic thing And answerit not, Incontinent did scho bring Paper and pen, with Ink scho had reddie Prayit me to write my minde thair quyetlie. And quhen I wrait, and all hir minde refusit, And praying hir for to hald me excusit: For I wald not defoull my Fatheris bed, Than the wryting vnder hir feit scho tred. Sine raif hir face, and all hir robbis rent, And with loud voice scho cryit Incontinent. And ?it that crime scho laid alone on me, Father in treuth this is the veritie. Quhen the Empreour this tail hard til him tald The Quenes face greitlie he did behald, With awsum vult, angrie and als austeir, And not but caus, saying on this maneir. O maist filthie and schameles creature: Micht thow na way stancheit thy foull nature With my bodie, and with thy Rebald knaif, Bot in like sort my awin sone thow wald haif. O wickit wife neuer taking regaird Of thy awin schame, nor of heuinlie rewaird. Had thow tane heid quhome of y? was discendit Thow wald neuer sa far to me offendit. Thow wrocht alwayis that euer thow culd Inuent On the Gallous to gar my sone be schent. And ay thy minde with falset was Infectit, Traisting all time sic wald not be correctit. Bot God is Iust, howbeit he thoill a time, As he thinkis caus he will puneis the crime. Thairfoir becaus of sic thow had na schame, Vpon thy self sall ly baith wite and blame: That me sa lang thy bedfellow hes blindit, Thairfoir thy flesche for sic faults now sall find it Th? gruiflings swyith scho fell vp? hir face Doun at his knie, and at him cryit for grace. Saying gude Lord, for thy Princelie pietie, To me maist vile thow wald grant sum mercie. For my greit gylt heir planelie I confes, Grant me sum grace for thy greit gentilnes. Than till hir said this Nobill Empreour, Quhilk was fulfillit of sturt and displesour. O vyle woman for mercie thow dois craif, Quhilk be na way is not worthie to haif. The cruell deith thow hes deseruit thrise, Quhilk I sall schaw planelie in thre kin wise. First thow hes done the sin of Adulterie, To the greit schame and contemptioun of me, Quhilk be the Law, expres is na remeid (Ane Princes bed for to defoull) bot deid. Than secundlie, my onlie sone and Air Thow did prouoke to be ane Adultrair. To that effect to the Chalmer him led, With the to ly, and to defoull my bed. Quhilk seruis deith, as na man can excuse, Albeit in treuth the same he did refuse. Thridlie Ilk day with fals taillis tystit me, Aganis Iustice, to gar my awin sone die. Becaus thow knew his Clergie and cunning, Thy foull baudrie &amp; filthines wald furth bring Thairfoir be Law thow seruis puneist be, And of the Law to haue extremitie. Than said the sone, Father richt weill ?e knaw How scho daylie tystit ?ow (not be Law) Bot with hir taillis and fen?eit fals lesing, Vpon Gallous but mercie me to hing. War not throw help of my gude Maisters seuin And first supplie of the greit God in heuin: Quhilk will euer the Innocent defend And into neid will to thame succour send. Quhilk presentlie now he to me hes done, Into my neid hes send me succour sone. Alswa Father I traist it was ?ow tald Be ?our Emprice, that I purpoist and wald Depriue ?our grace fra this Nobill Impire, Quhilk neuer was ?it trewlie my desire. And als scho said that it was my Intent, Zow to destroy with my Maisteris consent, And be that way ?our rowmes for to obtene, Quhilk trewlie ?it my minde did neuer mene. Sic for to do I pray God me defend, Or ?it think sic vnto my liues end. For of ?our grace my leuing all I haif; Ze ?it on liue, I aw na mair to craif. I am ?our sone, and ?e my Father deir, Wald I ?ow want for ony warldlie geir. Nay, nay, not sa for I sall ay laubour For to vphald ?our weilfair and honour. At my power and vtter diligence, With hart and hand, and all gude reuerence. At ?our plesure, ?our bidding and command, Lesting ?our life, ay constant sall I stand. Bot ?our emprice scho wrocht baith nicht &amp; day In all kin sort to wirk betuix vs tway As the Father kest the sone in the sie, Becaus the sone said him for veritie: That he suld be abone his Father Lord, To the quhilk taill the Father did not cord. Than the Father kest the sone in the sie, Bot the greit God gaue him help and supplie And wald not thoill that time he suld be deid, Bot throw his grace he send him sone remeid, Zit the sonnis taill it come trewlie to pas, And the Father ane myte not war he was. To the Father quhat hinderance culd it be, Howbeit the sone had obtenit dignitie. Not hindering the Father in na sort, I think it suld haue bene to his comfort. And God willing Father my gouernance Ze sall persaue sall be na hinderance, Nor preiudice in na sort to ?our grace, Bot alwayis salbe mirth Ioy and solace. Than said on heich this Nobill Empreour, To God alone be louing and honour, That sic ane sone vnforseruit hes me send, To gyde this Realme efter my dayis end. Sa wise, sa gude, sa verteous in all thing, To greit weilfair sa abill his Realme to bring. Now my deir sone hartlie I the requeir, Tell me sum taill that all about may heir. Quhairthrow yai may thy wisdome vnderst?d Quod he Father that sall I tak on hand. Sa ?e command all men to keip silence, Quhill I haue done, and giue me audience. Quhen I haue done as ?e think expedient On ?our Emprice giue furth th? ?our iudgem?t Than silence was commandit to all man, Dioclesiane thus gaits his taill began. Eftir Tytan had tane his staf in hand And lichtlie lap as Lord out ouir the land Becaus the day was baith sweit soft and fair, Than vp I rais, and past to my Librair. And studyit thair, a quhyle as I thocht gude Becaus it was my vse and conswetude. And sa efter my lessoun was compleit, Than to refresche, I recreat my spreit. As for that tyme I laid on syde my buke, And in my hand ane vther Volume tuke, Of lychter dyte, and storyis of the ald, That seir auld men befoir in tymes had tald In quhilk Volume diuers storeis ouir kest, That plesand was, bot ?it amang the rest Ane fyne fabill in that volume I fand, Quhilk at this tyme to our purpois may stand. This was the Mairch of the mater in deid, As ?e sall heir this Tale and I proceid. Befoir this tyme thair was ane nobill knicht Manlie in mynd and aboundant in micht. Ane gay Lady he had vnto his wyfe, And betuix thame thay led ane Godlie lyfe. Onlie ane Sone he had na barnis mo, Quhome of yai tuik, greit mirth blyithnes &amp; Io And him delyuerit in far and strange countrie, Him to Instruct and for to leir Clergie: Of cunning men that Clergie had perqueir, As ?e haue done to me this mony ?eir. Sa this ?oung man as he in persoun grew, Sa daylie did in cunning and vertew. Sine efter that he was seuin ?eir at lair, Considdering he was his Fathers Air. And had na ma to bruik his heritage, At seuin ?eiris end he send for him Message. Chargeing him sone for to cum hame fra hand Quhilk he obeyit his Fathers haill command. And quhen he come to his Fatheris presence, He hailsit him with all gude reuerence. As him effeirit, with greit humilitie, His Mother als in semblabill degre. Quhairof thay had baith game gle &amp; blyithnes That thair ane sone was c?min to sic grace. For not alone in vertew he Increst, Bot also was of bodie the liklyest. Manlie and stout weill maid at all fassoun, Weill fauourit of face and gude proportioun. Gentill, humane, courtes, Nobill and fre, All man him lude for his humanitie. Sa on a time it chancit vpon ane day, His Father and Mother at tabill sat thir tway The sone seruing thame baith richt courtaslie, Fra the Kitching the coursis brocht cumlie. In the meane time on ane tre lichtit doun, At the windo, and sang with heuinlie soun, Ane nichtingail, quhilk sang with noitis sa cleir Sa wonder sweit, that all hir noitis did heir. Aucht dayis in ane thay wald neuer thocht l?g To heir that bird, sa done sweit was hir sang. Than said the Knicht weil war he all his dayis That vnderstude quhat ?one bird singis or sayis. Than said the sone Father with ?our honour Sa that it be to ?ow na displesour, The birdis sang I sall declair to ?ow, Bot I am feirit that ?e tak sturt thairthrow. The Father said sone for my bennesoun, Quhat the bird singis mak Interpretatioun. Say on bauldie, for na persoun tak feir, For I thairat sall na wayis change my cheir. Than said the sone this is the verray taill, That ?e Father heiris of the Nichtingaill. That I sall be sic ane man of greit micht, And honourit be with Lord Barroun &amp; Knicht And sall cum to, that ?e my Father fre The water plait that ?e sall hald to me. And my Mother befoir me scho sall stand, Besyde ?our self with towell in her hand: Waitting quhill I wesche my handis in y? plait This is the sang that the bird sang of lait. The Father said thow fals misleirit knaif, Thow sall of vs sic seruice neuer haif: Nor neuer sall cum to sic dignitie, That we twa sall mak sic seruice to the. Sa in malice, and into greit wodnes, In greit furie, and vnnaturall kindnes. He led his sone, and kest him in the sie, In displesour, Inuy and crueltie. Saying efter in the sey he him flang Ly thow thair still, gessar of birdis sang. The Chylde culd swym, and sa chancit to land With heill and quert helpit be Goddis hand. And fastit thair as the historie sayis, But meit or drink be the space of four dayis. On the fyft day be chance ane schip come by, Quhairon schairplie richt loud the chyld c? cry. Skipper of schip for lufe and cheritie, Fra this perrell I pray ?ow to saue me. The skipper hard, and belyue drew to land, And saw the Chyld, and in quhat stait culd st?d On him thay had reuth and compassioun, Seing he was ane liklie gude persoun. The chance of deith sa narowlie eschewit, All in ane voice thair hartis vpon him rewit. And in on burde belyue did him ressaue, And in far landis to thair countrie did haue. Than to ane Duke of that countrie him sauld, For ane greit sowme of money to thame tauld. And as this Chylde grew daylie into age, In like maner he grew in personage. Meik and humane, in maners comfortabill, Gentill, Iocund, and to all game richt abill. Sa to all men he come in sic fauour, The Duke him lude, and tuik at him plesour, Into sa far, he had the haill credence Of all his hous, and the preeminence. In the same tyme the King of that countrie, All his greit Lords, and counsall callit he. His greit Barrouns, his knichts and nobill men That of his mind sum part that thay micht ken Amang the rest euin did this Duke also To the counsall preparit him for to go. And with thame tuke this Chyld in companie For his wisdome, and his greit courtasie. All thir Lords come with full greit reuerence Befoir the King gaue dew obedience. Thay being all togidder sa conuenit, To yame in plane ye king schew quhat he menit Saying my Lords and my trew Barrounis all Now to counsall for this I did ?ow call. The mater is sa greit I haue to tell, Thairfoir I wald ?e keipit all counsell Gif ony man the treuth will me declair, I him promit my douchter and myne Air: Into spowsage, and efter me be king, Quhen I am deid, for ay to bruke my Ring. This is the treuth, and mater mufis me, About this place resorts Rauins thre: And followis ay quhair euer I gang or lyis Rowpand in ane, and euer on me cryis. Quhylis me behind, &amp; quhylis thay cum befoir With siclyke luks, as thay wald me deuoir. Thay leif me not bot ay continuallie, Thay rowp thay rair, and euer schouts on me. Scraipand the eird and waffand w? yair wings Dawbing thair nebbis &amp; at the windois dings Thairfoir I send gif ony of ?ow did knaw, The caus heirof, that ?e wald to me schaw. His gude rewaird he sall not neid to craif, As I haue said the same thing sall he haif. Sa he deuoyd the Rauins fra me all clene, And in my sicht that thay na mair be sene. Quhen this was mufit to all the counsall thair Thair was na man the questioun culd declair. Than said this Chyld to his maister the Duke The man on hand that ?one same questio? tuke For to declair wald he get his promis Fra the Kings grace, ?ea, quod the Duke I wis. Than said the Chylde gif it plesit ?our grace, To schaw the King, I sall declair the cace, Under the pane to put my heid in pledge, As he hes said, for to fulfill the wage. Quh? y? Duke hard this tail he was richt glaid Incontinent past to the King and said, And pleis ?our grace thair is ane ?oung m? heir Ane cunning Clerk, in Clergie richt perqueir. Wise and wittie, and of Ingine richt hie, Quhilk promisis that he sall satisfie: All ?our desires and the samin fulfill, Tuitching the Rauins, sa that it be ?our will, For to compleit the thing that ?e haue said, Faith (quod the King) thairof I will be glaid. Than brocht the Duke this Chyld into pres?ce, Befoir the King with all gude reuerence. Than said the King, ?oung man can ?e declair The questioun that I proponit air: Befoir my Lordis, tutching the Rauins thre. Than said the Chylde that sall I do trewlie, Sa that ?our grace ?our promeis will fulfill. Than said the King but dout trewlie I will. Quha euer will this questioun declair, He sall mary my douchter and mine Air. Than said the Chyld this is the caus and quhy That thir thre Rauins dois daylie on ?ow cry. Thair was twa Rauins, ane female &amp; ane male That had clekkit the thrid withouttin fale. Quhair thay clekkit into that Ilk countrie, Was greit hounger, derth and penuritie, For fault of fude, wemen and men deceist, In lyke maner sa did baith foull and beist, Than this ?oung Rauin being intill hir nest, The Mother flew ouir feilds quhair scho thocht best Seiking hir fude, in l?d out ouir all quhair And of hir bird scho tuik na sturt nor cair. Than the Male Rauin seing that displesour, Vpon him self he tuik daylie laubour With panis and pine, and greit penuritie, Fed this ?oung Rauin quhil it had strenth to fle And fend the self out ouir the feildis fair, Sa of Mother it tuik na sturt nor cair. Now is past by the skant time of the ?eir. Meit grew at large, and vittaillis was not deir Men beist and foull, had meit aboundantlie, The Female Rauin come hame than haistelie. And wald haue had sic freindschip &amp; kindnes To the ?oung Rauin as he quhilk in distres Fed him with fude quhill he culd fend him sell, The Female Rauin thairof tuik na trauell, Than the male Rauin tuik weil into his thocht How he his bird had nureist and vpbrocht, In time of derth, penuritie and skant, He thocht na way his bird that he wald want For the Female out ouir the feildis flew, And left hir bird but help or ?it reskew Still in the nest quhilk thairfra culd not fle, Bot thair on force for to ly still and die. Thairfoir the male thocht he had mair kindnes To the ?oung Rauin, that in neid and distres Out of perrell it nureist and vpbrocht Nor the Female that flew and fed it nocht. Thairfoir the Male sayis that he suld posseid His awin ?oung bird that helpit it in neid. Rather than scho quhilk in necessitie, Left it alone but help in point to die. Than the Female alledgis this agane, That in the birth of hir bird had mair pane: Mair laubour, sorrow, and penuritie, Mair hounger than the Male had be sic thre. Thairfoir of him scho aucht to haue mair mirth That had of him sic sorrow in hir birth. For this Ilk caus my Souerane Lord the King Thir Rauins cryis, and for nane vther thing. Desiring ?ow to Iudge be ?our wisdome, Quha this ?oung bird sall bruik in time to cum Thairfoir will ?e on this thing giue sentence, Thay will na mair cum in ?our grace presence. Than said the King becaus that the Female Left hir awin bird into sic neid and bale, And in na sort wald nureis it nor feid, Bot fra it fled quhen that it had maist neid. I think alwayis with ressoun it suld stand, The bird suld be at bidding and command: With the Male Rauin, and in his companie, Becaus he fed it in necessitie. And quhair that scho alledges hir agane To haue mair sturt, sorrow trauell and pane In his clekking, furth bringing and his birth, I say to ?ow all that was turnit in mirth, Sa sone as scho hir awin bird quick culd se, Scho quyte for?et hir greit aduersitie. And als the male is caus of productioun, And Instrument of all generatioun, I say also in time of hir greit neid, He did his bird with pane nureis and feid: Quhen the Female it left into the nest, In greit hounger, and als with cald opprest. Thairfoir I giue diffinitiue sentence, That the Male Rauin sal ay haue still presence The fellowschip and als the companie Of the ?oung bird, quhair euer he gang or fle. And the Female his fellowschip sall want it, Except the Male vnto the Female grant it. Than quhen y? Rauins hard the King sa declair Incontinent thay flew vp in the air, With sic ane noyis, as it had thunder bene, And was na mair into that Regioun sene. This being done, in schort time efter than, Incontinent the King callit this ?oung man: And said gude freind ?our name to me ?e schaw Alexander (quod he) Schir thay me caw Than said the King ?e sall tak nane bot me For ?our Father and ?e my sone sall be. For ?e sall haue my douchter in spowsage, And efter me sall bruik hir heritage. And euer still sall heir be Lord and King And all this Realme sall haue in gouerning. Than Alexander in houshald still he baid, Daylie seruice vnto the King he maid. All men him lude for his greit courtasie, His gentilnes, and his humanitie. He was sa soft, sa humbill and mansweit, Courtes, cunning, debonar and discreit. In all gude games him self he did frequent, In hors, harnes, Iusting and turnament. And all gude games ganit for ane gentill man, Daylie exercit, and ay the praise he wan Abone all thame that dwelt into Egypt, He far excellit, and had the Maisterschip. In all that Realme nouther be far nor neir, In manlie actis thair was nane found his peir Nor ?it thair was na greit obscure questioun, Bot he thairto wald giue solutioun. Sa he gydit in all thing and weill prufit, With ?oung and auld wonder weill he was lufit. In this meane time Tytus the Empreour Quhilk was a man of greit micht and honour Of gentilnes, and als of courtasie, In all vertew he was A per se. Ouir all the warld sa far rang his renoun, That he precellit all vther that bure Croun. Into sa far, that ouir all quhair did fle His nobill name of Liberalitie. And round about into all partis him by, Baith far and neir oppinlie gart he cry: Gif ony man in maners and wisdome, And gude Ingine, vnto his Court wald cum Suld be Intreit into thair awin degre, And rewardit efter thair facultie. Quhen Alexander hard tell of sic ane thing, He past fra hand to his Father the King. And said to him kneiling vpon his kne, And pleis ?our grace my Nobill Father fre. The Nobill Court and courtasie is knawin Of the Empreour, and to ?our grace is schawin That euerie man delites thair to abyde, That hes knawledge outher to gang or ryde. Leirning sall leir, maners and manlynes, Prettick of weiris, gude gyding and proues. Dew Intreitting, with honour laude and gloir And greit rewaird he sall obtene thairfoir. And pleis ?our grace I wald desire hartlie, Into that Court and companie to be. That I micht wit and vertew daylie leir, My self exerce in Nobill actis of weir. This of ?our grace richt humblie I desire, Na wayis mening that of ?our grace I tire. For God willing I sall returne agane, To ?our plesure, quhilk is my Souerane. Than said the King, ?our talking plesis me, Bot laith war I to want ?our companie. Zit not the les caus ?e sic thing desire, I will glaidlie grant it that ?e require. Bot or ?e pas se that ?e furneist be, In all behalfis, gold, clais, hors and monie. That ?e want nocht that is neidfull to haue, That ?e yairthrow may baith our honours saue Siclike I think it war expedient, That ?e suld spous my douchter or ?e went. Or ?e returne perchance ane barne furth bring Than wist this Realme outher of quene or king. Alexander than said vnto the King, And pleis ?our grace to spair me of that thing Till my returne, than sall I with honour Zour douchter spous with ?our graces plesour Than said the King of that I am content, Euin as ?e will, thairto I do consent. And grantis ?ow heir with all beneuolence, To pas ?our time quhair that ?e pleis licence. Than Alexander at the King tuik gude nicht, And all y? Lords, baith Barroun squire &amp; knicht Sine last of all he past to the Ladie, Tuik his gude nicht, and gaue hir knifes thre, Bad hir be blyith, for lang he thocht not byde. Scho said gude schir I pray God be ?our gyde. Sa furth he fairis, ane liklie man to luik, And lap on hors, and on his veyage tuik. And with him went ane honest companie, With gold, siluer, furneist at all plentie. Vnto the Court quhair that the Empreour was He takis Iornay, and sa fordwart can pas. And quhen he come befoir the Empreour Vpon his kneis he hailsit him with Honour: Greit reuerence and all humilitie. Bot sa sone as the Empreour culd him se, Quhair that he sat, out of his sait he rais, To Alexander but mair tary he gais. And kissis him, as was of Court the gise, And in his armes he him Imbrasit twise. Sine him inquirit quhat was his name fra h?d Quhairfra he come, quhilk was his natiue land Siclike he speirit quhairfoir that he was cum. Tell on he said, the treuth of all and sum. He said and pleis ?our Nobill Maiestie, Alexander men vsis to call me. The King of Egypts sone and Air I am, I wait his grace will ratifie the same. And is cum heir vnto ?our Maiestie, To do seruice, gif ?e will accept me. Ze ar welcum the Empreour said than, Ze seme to be ane Nobill gentill man. To his Stewart than ane command he gaue, That in houshald Alexander he suld ressaue. The Stewart than to ane Chalmer him led, And schew him quhair that he suld haue his bed Weill perfurneist into all necessaris, With pertinentis thairto in all effaris. Alexander behauit him sa wiselie, With all the Court and Ilk m?nis lufe wan he Sa in schort time for his weill behauing, Maister Keruour he was maid to the King. Not lang efter the Kingis sone of France, To do seruice and daylie obseruance. In like maner come to the Empreour, Quhome he ressauit with blyithnes &amp; honour. And speirit siclike at him quhat was his Name He said Lodwik all men callis me at hame. And am cum heir to do ?our grace seruice, Gif that ?e pleis witchaif on me office, The Empreour said Alexander trewlie, Is my Keruour, my copper ?e sall be. For that office I think ?e be maist abill, To do seruice daylie befoir my tabill. Committit he to the Stewart Lodwik, To do to him, as to Alexander siclike. Sa the Stewart to Lodwik did assing That Ilk Chalmer was Alexanders ludgeing Quhairof thay war baith verray weill applesit That thay war twa into ane Chalmer esit. Thir twa ?oung men Alexander and Lodwik, In all kin sort thay war sa wonder like: In face, fauour, in forme and fassoun, In stature, visage, speiche and conditioun, That Ilk man said ane was the vthers brother Skarslie micht nane knaw the ane be the vther Bot Alexander in deidis was mair actiue, Than was Lodwik, and far mair scientiue. For Lodwik was schamefull and feminine, And Alexander peirt, furthie and Masculine. Of mair curage, mair manlie to behald, Than Lodwik was (sum said) be the thrid fald Thir twa ?oung men Ilk ane sa lufit vther Nane wald haue said, bot ane was vthers brother The empreour quhilk Tytus hecht to name Had ane douchter of fassoun fair and fame. Hecht Florentine, ane gracious gay Ladie, Quhilk neirest air to hir Father suld be. Quhome hir Father lufit sa abone measour, And till hir gaue aboundance of treasour. Hir awin seruandis scho had with hir to dwell And keipit Court and houshald be hir sell. To quhome daylie the Empreour vsit to send Of his dainteis, his douchters meis to mend In signe of lufe, daylie ane dische or tway, And Alexander to hir bure thame away: To this Ladie, befoir hir thame presentit, Sa in hir sicht Ilk day he was frequentit. Quhairthrow fauour of this Lady he wan, For his wisdome, abone all vther man. Throw besines it chancit on ane day, At dennar time Alexander was away Fra his seruice, and nane in his absence His fault suppleit, nor ?it gaue attendence. Than Lodwik come, and that persauit sone, Did sic seruice as Alexander suld haue done, And stude for him into the samin steid, His fault he did supplie and als remeid. And quhen dennar neir hand it was at end, The Empreour tuik vp ane dische and send To his douchter as he had wont to do, And bad Lodwik the same dische beir hir to, Beleuing weill Alexander it had bene, Few culd discerne thir twa visages betwene. Than went Lodwik his way to the Ladie, Presentit hir the dische vpon his knie: With reuerence, as he in hart best thocht, For he befoir that time hir sene had nocht. Incontinent quhen he the meit hir brocht: Scho persauit that Alexander it was nocht, Quod scho gude schir to me ?e schaw ?our name He said Lodwik, it is surelie Madame. Quhais sone ar ?e tell me but circumstance, My Father is (quod he) the King of France. Quod scho gude schir I thank ?ow of ?our pane Ze ar welcum to pas or ?it remane. Thank my Father of the meit he hes send, Quod he I sall, and sa furth can he wend. And tuik his leif with all gude reuerence, And past agane to the Empreours presence. In this meane time Alexander come to tabill, Did his seruice as he was wont and abill. The dennar done, Lodwik to Chalmer past Richt seik at hart, and laid him doun bedfast. Quhilk Alexander persauit Incontinent, And to Chalmer to Lodwik is he went, And said to him, O my gude compan?eoun Quhat is the caus that ?e ar now line doun? Than said Lodwik, I feill my self trewlie, Vext at the hart with sair Infirmitie. Greitlie I feir without I get remeid, It haldis me sa, that it sall be my deid. Alexander said the treuth I traist to ges, The principall caus of all ?our sair seiknes. For this Ilk day quhen that the meit ?e bair To ?one Lady, quhilk that ?e thocht sa fair. Ze hir beheld sa verray feruentlie, Hir gude maners, hir visage and bewtie, That ?e thairwith is hangit in hir lufe, Fra hir ?our hart na way ?e can remufe Than said Lodwik, O my gude brother deir, The verray treuth but dout ?e haue gane neir. All Phisitians in warld thay culd not ges, Nor Iudge mair trew the caus of my seiknes. Quhairof but dout I tak ane felloun feir, Get I na help, that it sall do me deir. Than Alexander bad him be of comfort, At my power I sall ?our pane support. Lift vp ?our hart and be of gude curage, Sturt in na way ?our seiknes can asswage. Than Alexander bethocht him on ane cast, Incontinent to the market he past: Ane precious claith with his awin gold he bocht Quhairof Lodwik knew na way nor wist nocht All set about with precious stanis coistlie, And presentit vnto the fair Ladie: Quhen scho it saw, scho askit him in hy: Quhair he culd get sic coistlie claith to by. Quod he the sone of the maist Christin King, Hes for ?our lufe Madame send ?ow this thing. Bot for a sicht that he saw of ?our face, He is sa fast lynkit in lufis lace. That he lyis seik without he get remeid, Appeirandly thair is nathing bot deid. And for ?our lufe suffer ?e him to die, It sal degraid ?our honour gretumlie. Alexander scho said, wald ?e now counsal me That I suld lois my clene Virginitie. Considdering I am of blude Royall Discendit doun of stock Imperiall And secundlie, as ?e knaw weill in deid Be apperance, to this Croun suld succeid. Gif I did sa as ?e to me declair, Than war I tynt: but dout for euer mair. Beleue ?e weill that ?e for sic Message Sall haue na thank nor wyn of me na wage. Thairfoir pas ?e fra hand out of my sicht, Zour message is nouther ressoun nor richt. He saw the Mayd was sum thing discontent Furth of hir sicht he past Incontinent. On the nixt day past Alexander agane To the market, and playit the counterpane. To this Lady he bocht ane fyne heid geir. Aboue the claith it was thre tymes mair deir. And present it vnto the Lady gent, On Lodwyks name, thairwith vnto hir went: Quhen the Lady this coistlie gift had sene, Scho meruellit greit quhat Alexander did mene And said to him I meruell of a thing, That ?e to me sic coistlie gifts suld bring Fra ony man, bot gif it war ?our sell, Deferring ay ?our awin erand to tell. And sa oft times ?e haue had my presence, And for to speik ?e micht haue had licence. Sic thing I se in ?our heid neuer sank Quhairfoir but dout I cun ?ow the les thank. Quod he Madame ?e mon hald me excusit, I durst not speik perchance ?e had refusit. And mairatouir my birth it is to law, Sa heich maters I durst not to ?ow schaw. Quod scho it is ane Prouerb of the ald, Quhilk I oft times in mirrines hes hard tald. Let ane ?oung man quhidder he speid or nocht Hane not his speich, but speik furth &amp; spair nocht. Into my hart (quod he) sic was not groundit Nor with sic thing my hart was neuer woundit And gif sic thing perchance had happinnit me, I wald haue chargeit ane of mair law degre Nor is ?our grace, bot my gude freind Lodwik Is the greit air of the maist cheif Kinrik: Of all the warld, and the maist Christin King, The mair baulder he durst desire sic thing. Rather nor I, quhilk may be na compair, Vnto ?our grace, for ?our blude singulair. Quod scho this word in remembrance ?e tak, Lufe quhome ?e like, thay say lufe hes na lak. Quod he quha hes into his companie, Ane gude fellow, as Lodwik now hes me: And in him traistis, am I not bound agane To wis him gude quhair that he lyis in pane At my power, in sa far as I may, Doutles Madame I culd not say him nay. Thairfoir I think ?e Lady traist and threw Wald ?e witchaif vpon Lodwik to rew, And on him haue compassioun and pietie, That is sa sair woundit in ?our bewtie. Ane word of ?ouris wald mak him haill agane, And him releif of all seiknes and pane. Let him na way his deid be on ?ow laid, For that thing sall ?our honour greit degraid. Gif ?e absent fra him ?our gude kindnes, Ilk man will say that ?e ar mercyles. Scho said gude schir forsuith ?e serue greit crime Of me ?e get na answer at this time. Thairfoir ?e may pas on fair weill adew, Ze ar to blame sa shairplie to persew: For ony man, bot gif it war ?our sell, Pas on ?our way, as now na mair I tell. He tuik his leif, and departit anone, The morne agane to the market is gone. And bocht ane belt, quhilk ten times was mair deir Nor was the claith, &amp; als the gay heid geir. And presentit vnto the Ladyis sicht, On Lodwiks name, the wofull woundit wicht Quhen scho persauit the giftis sa coistlie was, Into hir self scho kest and did compas Seir diuers thochts yat neids not to be schawin Nor to Ilk man in na kinde to be knawin. Thairfoir as now I think best let thame be, Ilk man suld not knaw Ladeis preuitie. Bot at the last to Alexander scho said, I wait not weill for to be mufit or glaid At ?our Message, bot wonder laith war me In my default that ony man suld die, A mannis life to lois for laik of lufe, Gif I sa did I war greit to reprufe. Thairfoir ?e sall in this point haue credence, In my Chalmer I will giue him presence. At the thrid hour that past is ouir midnicht, My Chalmer dure he sall find oppin richt, Schaw ?e him sa this is my minde and will. Zour minde (quod he) Madame I sall fulfill. Of this answer Alexander was glaid, Past to Chalmer, and to his fellow said. Lodwik ly not, ?e lurk ouir lang for lufe, I haue not hanit to hant for ?our behufe: The companie of ?one fair Ladie gent, Howbeit sum time scho stude not all content. Zit not the les sum grace I haue obtenit, To ?our Intent, sa far to hir I menit. Hir greit fauour to ?ow I haue purchest, And I beleue all is cum for the best. Thairfoir be blyith, and tak ?ow gude comfort, With clene curage now get ?e vp at schort. And in secreit I will ?ow schaw ane thing, To hir Chalmer this nicht I sall ?ow bring. Quhair that ?e sall richt wonder welcum be, And weill Intreit with that fair gay Ladie. Fra he that hard he was curageous, Baith haill and feir, Iocund and Iolyous. Als blyith at hart, and sturt away was worne, As euer he was, fra first day he was borne. Was neuer bird sa blyith of hir brydgrome, Was neuer bird sa blyith to licht on blome. Nor ?it Sparhalk sa blyith to get hir pray, Nor ?it the Lark, in fresche morning of May. Neuer Menstrell sa blyith of his rewaird, As was Lodwik, quhen he thay tythings hard Bot for to speik of perfite Potingaris, Fyne Phisitians, meruellous Medicinaris. Clerkis of cunning, and counsallouris of hele, Charmers of chafts and giuers of Liblele. I neuer red into na buik nor place, As Alexander was to Lodwik in this cace. For luik how sone that Lodwik hard him speik He said him self he was na langer seik. Ze knaw Lechis will haue ane lang proces, Gude Intreitting, rewardis and als kindnes. Bankettis making quhair euer it may be socht With Alexander be na way sa was nocht. Alexander debursit his money ay, Not being knawin to Lodwik in na way. Quhairthrow to him he conqueist this Ladie, Be coistlie giftis coft with his awin monie. Now let vs schaw how Lodwik vp he rais, With curious corps, and cleikit on his clais. Sine Alexander his minde vnto him schew, How the Ladie all his maladie knew. And how scho was of his c?ming content, And how that he did purches hir consent. Alexander conuoyit Lodwik that nicht, To the Chalmer of that fair Ladie bricht. With quhome he was in Ioy and mirrines, And fra thine furth euer keipit kindnes. In sic ane sort, quhair that anis Intent Without contrair that vther gaue consent. Sa still thay vsit in vthers companie, Beleuing weill all was done quyetlie. Zit not the les, it come vnto the eiris Of all the Court, amang Knichtis and squyeirs How that Lodwik sa stude in greit kindnes, With that Ladie wrocht sa in quyetnes. Sa amang thame thay did conspire his deid, Not regarding the Ladeis fauour nor feid. And Alexander thairof gat knawledgeing, He armit his cors for to ganestand that thing. And quh? thay knew that Alexander tuik part Him to persew fra thine furth thay tyne hart. Into sa far, fra all sic thay did ceis, And sufferrit weill Lodwik to ga in peis. Howbeit oft times into greit Ieopardie, For Lodwikis saik Alexander was trewlie. Bot to Lodwik sic was not knawin a deill, Bot the Ladie it knew richt wonder weill. Than in schort time thair was a message send Out of Egypt, be writing makand kend, That of the lait was new deceissit thair King, Quhilk abone thame mony ane ?eir did Ring. Requiring hame Alexander to cum, And with honour ressaue his awin Kingdome. For his Ladie the Kingis douchter and Air Of his absence tuik baith greit sturt and cair. Becaus the Realme was desolait of ane heid Vnto that hour, sen hir Father was deid. Quhilk sone he schew to Ladie Florentine, And thairefter to Lodwik schew it sine. Than he in haist behuifit to depart, Quhairof thay war baith wonder sad in hart. Also he past vnto the Empreour, And said plesit ?our graces greit honour. Furth of Egypt I haue ressauit writing, Makand it kend my Fathers departing. And it behuifis me to pas and ressaue, The Croun thairof, be richt thairto I haue. Gif that ?our grace will licent me to pas, Without ?our favour I will na licence as. For but ?our leif or I suld licence take I had rather baith Croun and Realme forsake, In thir effairis, quhat euer plesis ?our grace, Of verray treuth as standis euin the cace. The Empreour said ?e sall knaw verralie, Of ?our depart my hart is richt heuie. For I held ?ow amang my seruandis all, Into my hous euer the principall. Bot it bec?mis not to ane Empreour, Into na sort, nor ?it is his honour To his seruandis to mak Impediment, Quhat time thay be promouit to ony rent: Bot far rather to help thame and supplie To greiter giftis, and hier dignitie. Thairfoir ga ?e fra our Stewart ressaue Als mekill gold as ?e pleis for to haue: With my blissing, and with my Inwart hart, In Goddis Name I leif ?ow to depart. And bad fair weill and sa he tuik gude nicht At the Empreour, sine at Lord squire &amp; Knicht. Quha was sorie of his schort departing, For he was lude baith with the auld and ?ing. Than past Lodwik, and with him Florentine, And on gaitward conuoyit him myles nine Alexander wald let thame na farther go, Bot for to se the dolour and the wo: Quhen thay departit, quhairto suld I say mair It wald haue maid ane haill m?nis hart richt sair. For verray wo to ground all thre fell doun And Florentine for wo scho fell in swoun. Alexander than tuik hir vp agane, Comfortit hir of hir dolour and pane. And richt sa did to his fellow Lodwik, Comfortit him with mony wordis siclike. And said to him, now my fellow and brother, Quhome I lufe best of men abone all vther. In time c?ming for to keip ?ow fra skaith, This I ?ow say, and to my Lady baith: Tuitching secreitis that is betwene ?ow two, Keip thame quyet or ?e will suffer wo. Thairfoir tak heid, and tent richt weill about, Do ?e not sa, ?e stand baith in greit dout. For weill I wait ane vther in my steid Sall cum but dout, and haue ?ow at sic feid. With greit haitrent, dissait and als Inuy, Baith day and nicht sall ?ow chak and espy. To se gif thay can chalange ?ow with crime, Thairfoir be war and tak gude tent in time. For gif thay can reproche ?ow ony way, And ?ow rebuke, swyithlie thay will assay. With the Emperour in fauouris ?e do stand, Thairfoir the mair thay will cast at ?our hand Than said Lodwik in sa far as I may, I salbe war, baith be nicht and be day. Bot wo allace thairin quhat sall I do, Quhen I haue nane that I dar lippin to. That I suld want ?our treuthfull companie. I can not mend, thairfoir full wais me. Zit hartlie I require ?ow of a thing, Ze will ressaue fra me this litill Ring. Betuix vs twa to be in remembrance, Of twa Princes of Egypt and of France. Alexander said the Ring I will ressaue In remembrance of ?ow still for to haue. Bot ?it howbeit the Ring I had not tane, Zour remembrance fra me na way had gane. And sa ather about the nek Imbrasit, With greit kindnes, and sine about the waist. Bot Florentine was sa confound in Spreit, Scho culd do nocht, bot sat hir doun to greit. Alexander said amendis now na greting, Bot I pray God send vs mirrie meting. And sa partit with hartis wonder wo, Vnto thair hame, Ilk ane thair gait did go. Not lang efter the Kingis sone of Spane Come to the Court in seruice to remane. Namit Gwydo: and gat that Ilk office, That Alexander had into seruice. Als the Stewart to him he did assing, That samin hous, the Chalmer and ludgeing, That Alexander and Lodwik dwelt intill, Quhilk was but dout all aganis Lodwiks wil Howbeit the same na way he culd amend it, Bot ?it his hart thairwith was sair offendit. Lodwik to Gwydo culd keip na fellowschip, As he did to Alexander of Egypt. Thairfoir Gwydo aganis him tuik Inuy, Howbeit thay baith in ane Chalmer culd ly. And Lodwik had of Gwydo sickin feir, That he durst not to the Ladie ga neir: In auenture that Gwydo suld espy Of his secreitis, and thame in oppin cry. Zit not the les of hir he had sic thocht, Hir companie to abstene culd he nocht. Nor ?it scho culd his companie weill want, Sa he agane sum times to hir did hant. Than Gwydo that persauing was not sleuth, On thame to wait, quhill that he knew y? treuth That Lodwik had with Ladie Florentine, Sa greit kindnes, that he thocht efter sine: Considdering weill the treuth sen he did knaw, Sum time vnto the Empreour he suld schaw. Sa in his minde he held it quyetlie, With fals dissait, quhill he his time micht se. Vpon ane time the Empreour in his hall Talking about amang his Nobillis all. Praising greitlie the wit and gentilnes Of Alexander, the wisdome and kindnes. And said he was baith trew verteous and wise To gyde ane hous richt weill he culd deuise. Than said Gwydo, and pleis ?our Maiestie, Sa far praisit he aucht not for to be. Nor for to be commendit as ?e wene, Ane greit tratour in ?our hous he hes bene. The Empreour said, tell on how that can be. Than said Gwydo, I sall ?ow tell trewlie, To ?our douchter ?e haue ane Ladie fair, The quhilk suld be appeirandlie ?our Air: And be the help of falset and supplie Of him, Lodwik hes done hir velanie. And sa nichtlie quhen Lodwik takis delite, He hes his will of that fair Ladie quhite. And all this come be the fals subtell slicht Of Alexander, that he wrocht day and nicht. Quhen the Empreour this tail hard til him tald Into his minde was muifit monyfald. In that same time Lodwik come throw y? hall, And vpon him the Empreour sone did call. And said quhats this that I heir tell of the, Gif it be trew thow salbe hangit hie. Than said Lodwik and pleis ?our nobil grace Ze will me schaw thairof how is the cace. Than said Gwydo in oppin audience, Heir I auow in ?our graces presence: That Lodwik lyis with Ladie Florentine, Als sure as standis on craig this heid of mine, And sa he hes defoulit the blude Royall, Quhilk I sall preif on him in plane battall: On his bodie, and thairat sall I stand, Defend it now, gif thow dar tak on hand. Than said Lodwik plesit ?our Maiestie, I am saikles of ?one he sayis on me. And richt falslie he layis on me sic crime, Quhilk I sall preif, quhen euer he thinkis time Sa into God I traist to find remeid, All his falset sall fall on his awin heid. Than kest Gwydo his gluif doun for a trane, Lodwik lowtit, and tuik it vp agane. Saying I will that Ladeis fame defend, With hart and hand vnto my lifes end. The Empreour than to thame baith did assing Ane certane day of battell and fechting, And to thame baith he bad silence and rest And bad thame pas quhair that thay plesit best Than past Lodwik to the Ladie fra hand, And all the cace he gart hir vnderstand. And how he was accusit in presence Of hir Father, in oppin audience. And how that he assignit the fechting day, And vnto hir in this maner can say. Now Florentine my Ladie fair and gent, It me behuifis to wirk with auisement; With ?ow alwayis, for sa the mater standis, I can not chaip vndeid of Gwydois handis. For quhy gif I had nayit to him battall Than had I ?ald my self all criminall. And of the crime grantit my self gyltie, Thairfoir force was to counterfute mellie. Alswa Gwydo is wonder stout and strang, In fait of armes he hes bene vsit lang. I neuer knew in na companie heir, Bot Alexander to fecht can be his peir. For I am waik and febill of persoun, And to his strenth hes na comparisoun. Gif I him meit in feild quhat salbe than, Without refuge, I am bot ane deid man. And sa on me sall ly the caus and blame, And ?e for ay sall thoill sclander and schame. Than Florentine to Lodwik this can say. Sen sic ane chance is cum betuix vs tway. And I feill ?ow dispairit in ane part, And in this cace ouir waik spretit in hart. Zit not the les quhair twa Illis dois approche I think it best fra the greitest to foche. The first Ill is, fra ?e ?ow gyltie grant, Than sal I ay baith welth and worschip want And ?e also be put to cruell deid, And I for ay my life in langour leid. The secund is, gif ?e to battell boun, Ze ar sa waik and febill of persoun. And Gwydo is sa strang and als hardie, That ?e dow not ganestand him straikis thre. And sa alwayis I can find na remeid, How euer it go thair is to ?ow bot deid. Thairfoir heirin ?e sall my counsall do, Ze sall but let my Father sone pas to: And schaw to him on ?our maist humbill wise, That ?our Father vpon his deid bed lyis. Quhairof thair is new writings cum ?ow till, Desiring him, gif that it be his will: To prorogat the day of battell set, That ?e may gang, and cum agane but let. And in meane time with ?our Father to speik, Be the ressoun he lyis sa wonder seik. And for to ken his perfite latter will, That in all pointis the same ?e may fulfill. And for to speik with him twa wordis or thre, Furth of this warld or he depart and die And that ?e may his bennesoun obtene, With his awin mouth, sine ?e to lowk his ene, And quhen ?e haue obtenit his licence, To Alexander in all gude haist pas hence. And secreitlie to him the mater schaw, How all thing standis, perfitelie let him knaw And him require into this extreme cace, That he wald cum and to supplie ?our place. Contrair Gwydo, with him in battell fecht, Becaus ?our self to do the same hes hecht. This counsall than it plesit Lodwik weill, Euin as scho said, sa did he euerie deill. Licence obtenit, and als prolongit the day, To Alexander Lodwik tuik his Iornay. Small rest he tuik, bot raid on day and nicht To Egypt land, quhill he come vnto richt. To the Castell than come he on in hy, Quhair that the King gude Alexander culd ly. Quhen the King gat of Lodwik knawlegeing He meruellit greit the caus of his c?ming. Incontinent to meit him is he gane As his brother, euin sa with him hes tane, With all honour he did him thair ressaue, As him become, or he lykit to haue. Than said Lodwik my deir brother and freind In times bygane, and euer ?it hes bene. Now at this time I let ?ow vnderstand, My life and deid lyis baith into ?our hand. He said brother mak knawin to me ?our querrel Zour life salbe God willing in na perrell. Than said Lodwik, ?e remember ?e schew, At our parting, sum wordis quhilk I find trew Saying I suld in fellowschip ane haue Into ?our steid, perchance wald me dissaue. And ly in wait my secreitis to espy, Quhilk now in deid richt wonder weill find I. Ze said without I war mair circumspect In quhilk my self in sum part did neglect. For ane Gwydo the Kingis sone of Spane, Into ?our steid with me he did remane. And be ressoun my secreitis he not knew, To my Lady I durst not lang persew. And sa at lenth I culd not lang abstene, It chancit him knaw the secreitis vs betwene: And me accusit befoir the Empreour, Quhilk vnto me was vtter displesour. And hes promeist in battell to mak gude, That I defoullit the hie Imperiall blude. Sa hand for hand in battell we mon fecht, To counter him be my hand I haue hecht. This day aucht dayis the battell suld be done, Quod Alexander forsuith that is ouir sone. Als quod Lodwik Gwydo is stout and strang, And hes bene vsit in actis of weiris lang. And I am waik and febill as ?e kend, Fra his greit dyntis I dow not me defend. And Florentine thairfoir gaue me counsall, Zow for to schaw the caus and mater haill. For scho beleuis ?ow ay hir faithfull freind, And hiddertillis sa euer mair hes bene. And traistis doutles ?e will help and supplie, Baith me and hir in this necessitie. Than Alexander to Lodwik can he say, Is thair ony knawis ?e come heir away? Bot Florentine (quod he) forsuith not ane, For ilk man trowis that to France I am gane For to vesie my Father lyand seik, Thir same wordis to the Empreour I did speik, To that effect he did prolong the day, And I at poist to ?ow am cum away. Quod he schaw furth quhat Florentine bad desire Or quhat at me is thing scho bad require. Or quhat counsall gaue Florentine to ?ow, That I suld help, in quhat maner and how. Than Lodwik said, O my maist c?stant freind This stands the cace I traist that scho did mene Considdering we twa be sa done like, That ?e suld cum with Gwydo battell strike, And nane knawing bot Florentine allane, The battell done, ?e to cum hame agane. And I siclike in Court to present me, As I had done the Act and Ieopardie. Alexander said the battel ?e haue set, This day aucht dayis to fecht withouttin let, It is to schort, for euin this stands the cace, I can not weill be reddy in sic space. For tary I the morne withouttin mair, I can not find that I may weill be thair. Thairfoir but dout quhat I sall say heirto, I can not tell, nor wait not how to do. And my subiectis I haue commandit haill, That thay be heir the morne at my brydaill, Keip I Iornay, thocht I ryde at the poist, Of my wedding the day is tynt and loist. Gif I ga not, and keipis not the battaill Than Florentine and ?e ar loist but faill. Thairfoir Lodwik quhat think ?e best to do, Quhat ?e deuise heir I apply thairto. Lodwik heiring the excuse ressonabill, To fall in swoun quhair that he stude was abil Began to sich, and sorrow monyfald, For to his hart catchit was cairis cald. Saying all tray and tene to me betydis, Sorrow and cair now c?mis on all kin sydes. Persauing that Alexander till him said, Let be sic sturt, tak comfort and be glaid. For I will not forsaik ?ow this veyage, Thocht I suld baith tine wife and heritage. Bot ?e sall heir in thocht quhat I haue tane, Into sa far as we twa ar like ane. And as ?e ken it is not lang ago The Empreours Court hidder sen I come fro. Zit I am not weill knawin in this countrie, Mony my Lords as ?it hes not sene me. And for that caus thay ken not my presence, Thay will tak ?ow for me in my absence. Thairfoir heir sall ?e tary and abyde, And in my steid ?e sall Mary my bryde. And hald the Feist with greit solempnitie, And gar all thing be done that done suld be. Howbeit my self in bodie be absent, Let nathing want mair than I war present, To my Renoun pertenis or honestie, Gif I for ?ow, do ?e siclike for me. Except onlie quhen that ?e pas to bed, With my awin wife, howbeit that ?e hir wed. Into my Name, and my Authoritie, Into that cace se that ?e faithfull be And sa but baid, I sall Incontinent Loup vpon hors and to the battell went. And set my cors for ?ouris into the feild, And ?our actioun debait with speir and scheild And gif that God grantis me the victorie, For to vincus Gwydo ?our Enemie. Without tary I sall returne agane, And ?e siclike in Court for to remane, As ?e had done the principall act ?our sell, Sa with honour in Court still sall ?e dwell. This being done Alexander tuik gude nicht, Latting na wit vnto his Ladie bricht. Vnto the Court fra hand tuik his Jornay, Na man knawing the mater bot thay tway. Sa Lodwik baid at hame still with the Quene Into Egypt, as Alexander it had bene. And on the morne Lodwik with noueltie, Past to the Kirk in greit solempnitie. As it had bene Alexander the King. And spousit his wife at the Kirk with ane Ring Na man knawing bot Alexander it had bene, That had spousit with greit honour the Quene And held the Feist with mirth and mirrines, Greit honour, gloir, triumph laude &amp; blyithnes All menstralie of Musick was yair thair. Wantit nathing of mirth quhat wald ?e mair Of meit and drink it neidis not for to speik, That neidfull was thair was nathing to seik. All the greit Lords and Nobills that was yair Thay maid greit mirth and solace singulair. Sine quhen nicht come all men bownit to rest To ga to bed the bryde scho thocht it best. Bot quhen Lodwik past to bed with the quene Ane naikit sword he laid thame twa betwene. Quhairof scho had ane greit meruell &amp; wonder On the first nicht, that thay suld ly asonder. Sa he Ilk nicht with the Quene did remane, Hir bedfellow quhill hir King come agane. Nathing scho said, bot ?it mekill scho thocht, Be the ressoun the treuth that scho knew nocht. Now let Lodwik and the Quene byde at hame And we will speik of Alexanders fame. Than come belyue the day of Tornament, Alexander to the Empreour he went. And said O maist redoutit Souerane, Vnto ?our grace now I am cum agane: Left my Father in greit Infirmitie, Douting nathing bot schortlie he sall die. And to debait this battell with my blude, And with my handis my querrell to mak gude For God willing to all it salbe kend, That I Iustlie my querrell sall defend. The Empreour said ?e do all that ?e can, According to ane Nobill gentill man. And beleue gif ?our querrell be richt, Ze sall triumph like ane kene cruell Knicht. Fortoun will fauour ?our querrell and actioun, Howbeit ?e fecht contrair ane Campioun. Than quyetlie he past in vnder cure, To Florentine the hie gait fordwart fure. Of quhais c?ming scho was richt w?der glaid Scho him Imbraist, sine kist and efter said: Blist be the time that ?e ar c?min heir, Fra all dolour to mirth hes changeit my cheir. Ze ar als welcum to me now ?our allane, As ony man on life excepting ane. For ay with me ?e tuik sa trew ane part, Quod he Ladie I thank ?ow with my hart. Quhair is Lodwik, I pray ?ow to me schaw, And how he dois, I wald ?e leit me knaw. He said Lodwik was into greit blyithnes, In mirth and Ioy, and in greit mirrines; Thair is na man leuis in mair lustie life, For he hes now maryit ane gay ?oung wife. Maryit (said scho) I think that can not be, It is for treuth forsuith Madame said he. Euin on the morne efter I tuik veyage, It was assignit the day of Mariage. The Banket was prepairit richt weill I ken, And callit thairto was mony Nobill men. All thing was drest, thair was na mair ado, Bot on the morne the Kirk for to ga to. The Ladie said, quhat woman may that be. He said forsuith scho is ane gay Ladie, Lustie of lufe, richt bounteous and fair, Of that countrie scho is appeirand Air. Quod Florentine schort kindnes thair hes bene Or ellis auld lufe that hes bene thame betwene Bot gif sic thing that Lodwik now hes wrocht Zour c?ming heir I think it is for nocht. Hir countenance to keip bad fill the cop, Howbeit I trow scho list not drink ane drop. Than Alexander persauing hir patience, Hir lawlynes, and gentill countenance. Na langer he wald hald hir into noy Bot turnit hir sturt Incontinent to Ioy. Quod he Ladie be blyith and mak na cair, All he hes done is done for ?our weilfair. Ze knaw richt weill is nane in warld mair lyke In all fassouns nor I am to Lodwyk. Sa quhen he come and tald me his erand, Euin on the morne my brydall suld haue stand And be ressoun I culd not keip dyet, Nor ?it to byde the day of byrdall set. Becaus on him sa strangelie come the cace, Kindnes causit me to put him in my place. Sa I causit him in my place for to pas, Na man knawing bot the same man I was. And wed my wife as it had bene my sell, And I to tak the chance of the battell, For gif that I quhill the brydall was done Had biddin at hame, I had not cum sa sone To the first day of battell that was set, Zit than I thocht my brydall suld not let. Sa I him left in my Realme to be King, Quhill I returne, and ?ow to honour bring. Gif scho was blyith it neidis not for to talk, He tuik his leif, and to Chalmer did walk. Bot Florentine thair was nane that culd tell, Of verray treuth, bot it was Lodwiks sell. Sa on the morne the day of battell was, And Alexander vnto the feild can pas. Into sic geir as than to him effeirit, And on his steid sa stoutlie he him steirit. Sine lichtit doun like ane kene cruell Knicht, To the Empreour the hie way raikit richt. Befoir Gwydo thir wordis to him he said. My greit Souerane ane crime is on me laid Be this Gwydo, falslie befoir ?our face, He me accusit befoir ?our Nobill grace, Saying that I had carnall knawledgeing Of ?our douchter, and hir flesche defouling, Quhilk to ?our grace it war greit dishonour, And I siclyke to ?ow ane greit Tratour. Bot heir I sweir, and als affirmes surelie, Be the greit God that bled his blude for me. Be the Euangells that our Sauiour spak, And all the michts that God in warld did mak. That I neuer in na maner of way, Knew ?our Douchter, as Gwydo did ?ow say. My mynd was not to do hir dishonour, Into na way, to ?our grace displesour. And I this day be help of Goddis grace, Vpon Gwydo, sall preif befoir ?our face, That he has leid, in dispyte of his hart, And all his kin, and quha will tak his part. Than said Gwydo, ?it I say anis agane, Befoir ?our grace, thow art a Tratour plane. And als I sweir be God Omnipotent, With thy awin flesche, his Douchter thow hes schent, To thy plesour, and thy foull appetyte, Ay quhen thow lyst, or thairin had delyte. Euerilk nicht had hir at thy plesour, Quhilk was to hir greit schame and dishonour. And als vnto the Empreours Maiestie, Oppin tressoun, quhilk I sall preif on the, Vpon thy heid, in contrair all thy kin, Cum and defend, gif thow wald worschip win. Than Heralds cryit with loud voce hie on hicht Ga togidder, we pray God schaw the richt. Incontinent thay stendit on thair steids, Lyke vail?eant men, into thair weirlyke weids. As twa bald Bairs, togidder baith thay ran, Ilk ane was lyke to ding doun hors and man. Speirs sprang like sparks as fyre dois of y? flynt Thair docht na man Indure yair doutsum dynt Quh? speirs was past yair schyn?g swords drew Quhill plait and maill all into flenders flew. thair swords yai sw?g quhil yair steids swat at syds the giltin spurs y? cheual skin throw glyds Froith ran fra fronts of the feirs forsie steids, Quhill hors and man baith at the basnet bleids. Styf straiks they stryke of vthers stude nane aw Quhill Alexander at last ane wantage saw. On Gwydois nek ane nakit place he spyis, Quhair at gude speid he stryks twyse or thryis. Quhill at the last, thair at he straik sa lang, All the harnes was thair away he dang. And thairefter bot ony mair delay, He put Gwydo intill ane feirfull fray. Gwydo that seis, agane vpon him setts Of his Gorget ane buckill or twa he fretts. And straik his Gorget doun vpon his breist, Alexander ane vther straik waillit neist: Vpon his nek quhilk he persauit was bair, With all his strenth, ane straik he laid on thair. Quhill baith thair steids stakkerit at the stound And Gwydois heid it hoppit on the ground. Syne lychtit doun and tuke it in his hand, To the Lady it send into presand. Quhairof scho was richt w?der blyth and glaid To hir Father the same scho bure and said. Father behald, the heid quhilk vpon me, Sa falslie leid, sic feid vnfaithfullie. Quhilk ?ow and me at his power defamit, Bot the blameles him self hes maid vnblamit. The Empreour said the vail?eand victorie Be Lodwik wrocht, is now schawin patentlie. And said Lodwik it may be hard and sene, Beleuing weill that Lodwik it had bene. For ?e haue saift this day fra schame and skaith Zour awin honour, &amp; als my douchters baith. And fra thine furth the mair ay sall ?e stand, In my fauour, I hecht ?ow be my hand. And heirefter quha euer dois ?ow defame, In that behalf, he sall Incur my blame. And at my hand salbe accusit of crime, That sic thing talkis of ?ow in ony time. Than Alexander said vnto the Empreour, The victorie is ay at Goddis plesour. Quha traistis in him na way he will th? wrak Nor thair Iust caus he will not thraw abak. Bot will alwayis defend the Innocent, And will not thoill the saikles to be schent. Sen he hes send to me the victorie, Thanks euer mair to him alanerlie. Bot now my maist redoutit Lord and King, Humblie ?our grace I require of a thing. Fra my Father quhen I last did depart, He was sa vext with seiknes at his hart, That we beleuit nathing bot standand deid, And now this cace as ?e knaw come on heid, That I micht not at that time weill remane, Now I wald haue licence to pas agane. To vnderstand in quhat stait all thing standis And thairefter to put reule in my landis. And gif he be of seiknes conuolest, Quhill I returne I sall tak lytill rest. The Empreour said ?our langage liks me weill Bot I wald not, sa mot my saull haue seill: Want ?our seruice, nor ?our daylie presence, Zit not the les I grant ?ow gude licence. For sic effairis as ?e haue schawin to me, To pas agane into ?our awin countrie. Than he tuik leif, and bad Ilk ane gude nicht To his awin Realme raid hame y? gait ful richt In this meane time Lodwik he thocht greit l?g To luik about, to the wall heid did gang. And persauit ane hors man c?ming fast, Sine Alexander he knew weill at the last. Quhome quhen he saw he was baith blyth and glaid, And hartfullie ressauit him and said. O maist trew freind, of all my freinds on liue, Quhais greit kindnes my wittis c? not discriue Ze ar welcum sa far heir as I may How haue ?e done, and sped in ?our Iornay: Or quhat kin end that ?e haue brocht it to. Quod he Lodwik now ?e haue les ado. Nor of befoir, for Gwydo is departit, Thairfoir be blyith and wonder mirrie hartit. I wait I send his heid to Florentine, To hir Father scho it presentit sine. Thairfoir ga ?e vnto the Empreour, For now ?e stand far mair in his fauour: Nor euer ?e did befoir in ony time, And als ?e ar maid clene of all kin crime, That Gwydo laid vpon ?one fair Ladie Tuitching hir fame, and ?our awin honestie. Than said Lodwik it neidis me say no moir, My life oft times ?e haue preseruit befoir. And now my life and als my honestie, Siclike preseruit the fame of ane Ladie. Quhilk be na way I can not recompence, Bot quhill I leif, all the beneuolence Of my hart rute ?e salbe euer sure, Sa lang as I into this lyfe Indure: Togidder als with all my Gold and geir, Sa lang as I on lyfe is lestand heir Than thay Imbraist, at vthers tuik gude nicht And Lodwik raid vnto the Empreour richt. Na man knawing Alexanders absence, For all his Court beleuit his awin presence. Siclyke this Quene, nathing the mater knew, For na man was, that sic thing to hir schew. Syne quhen nicht come, Alexander him sped, Without tary vnto the Quenis bed. Sone in his armis he hynt hir in all haist, With fair sweit wordis richt tenderlie Imbraist With all plesure that thairto did pertene, Or into bed ane King do to ane Quene. Quod scho quhairfoir sen first ?e did me wed, And euerie nicht I lay into ?our bed. Ze neuer schew lufe nor kindnes to me, Nor na freindschip quhil now how may this be For I beleue ?e had Iudgeit sum crime, In my contrair, quhilk neuer in my time I committit vnto ?our Nobill grace, Quhairof I am astoneist in this cace. Out of my minde it can not weill depart, Bot still remane at the ruitis of my hart. Quod he thairat quhy ar ?e discontent, All that I did was done in gude Intent. In gude Intent (quod scho) thair I say nay, For euerie nicht ?e laid betuix vs tway Ane naikit sword, and neuer couet moir Of my persoun, and knew na caus quhairfoir. I did all that (said he) for probatioun, And als of lufe ane greit confirmatioun: Betuix vs twa of euerlasting lufe, On sic ane sort I thocht I wald ?ow prufe. In all my dayis ?e sall not find agane, Ane naikit sword in bed betuix vs twane. Zit not the les the Quene said in hir thocht, In all my dayis for?et it sall I nocht. That lufe thow trowis for to obtene of me, In thy dispite I sall it wraik on the. Zit nocht scho said, bot thocht it in hir minde, How scho micht turne hir lufe in vther kinde. Thair was ane Knicht that scho lude of befoir. And fra thine furth scho lude him moir &amp; moir. At last thay twa bethocht thame of ane thing, How thay micht best sla and distroy the King. Betuix thame twa ane consait sone thay fand, Gaue him poyso?, and thocht that he fra hand Suld be bot deid, and ?it his complextioun It was sa stark, it tuik na Infectioun In his entrales, bot brak furth fra his hart, Into the flesche, and schew the self outwart. Sa be wirking within ane schort proces, It was conuert in vther sair seiknes. Vncurabill ay haldin amang vs, And turnit intill ane Lipper La?arus. Quhill that na man with patience micht him se And all his Lordis dispysit his companie. Saying it is ane thing richt odius, Ane laith Lipper for to Ring abone vs. For all his barnis, and all his haill offspring, Withouttin faill sall haue the samin thing. And sa at schort him of all dignitie, Thay quite denude, for his Infirmitie. Out of his Realme as ane beggar him draif, Quhill he behude to beg amang the laif. In this meane time of Rome the Empreour, Payit his dew det, quhairof was greit dolour. Quha was Father to Florentine sa fair, Of the Impire scho was appeirand Air. And with auise of his counsall did wed, Lodwik hir lufe, and brocht him to hir bed. Quhairthrow he was maid principal empreour And gat the Croun thairof with greit honour. In the same time of France the Nobill King, Lodwiks Father in likewise maid ending. And payit his det as naturall cours him gaue, As dois all thing that euer did life ressaue. And sa Lodwik come Empreour throw chance Siclike he was the michtie King of France. Abone thame baith atanis sa did he Ring, And baith atanis he had in gouerning. Than Alexander quha was laitlie deposit, Fra his Kingdome the quhilk he suld haue Iosit Hard tell for treuth Lodwik was Empreour, And King of France and thairof possessour. Vnto him self he said and tuik in minde, I will ga se gif that Lodwik be kinde. For diuers times I haue Ieopard my life, Baith for him self, and siclike for his wife. Now will I go and till him mak my mane, He will me help I am sure and certane. Sa on ane nicht Alexander vp rais, And as he micht, purelie put on his clais. And steppit furth with his staf in his hand. With cop and clapper vnto the Empreours l?d Quhen he come thair he sat doun at his ?et, Amang the lipper sum Almous for to get. The Empreour come furth vpon ane day, Of his Palice to sport him and to play. Efter his play agane to Palice past, And to dennar Ilk ane thay bownit fast. All the Lipper thay clappit and thay cryit, Bot at that time all Almous was denyit, And Alexander clappit as did the rest, Thocht thay gat nocht, to bide ?it he thocht best Vnto the time the Empreour was set, Beleuing weill sum Almous for to get. And vp he rais, and neir the ?et he went, Thairat knokit with meik minde and Intent. The porter said quhais that that knoks sa bald Quod he ane pure with ?ow sum erand wald. Requiring ?ow for lufe and cheritie That ?e will do sum small message for me. The Porter said quhome to is that message, Few is heirin of quhome ?e haue knawledge. Alexander said, gude freind with ?our plesour, My erand is vnto the Empreour. The Porter said dois ?our erand pertene To the Empreour, I wait not quhat ?e mene. Schaw me the mater and quhat is ?our Intent And I sall tell ?our taill Incontinent. He said I ?ow require for Goddis lufe, And for his saik that sittis in heuin abufe: Ga ?e and tell vnto the Empreour, Ane man is heir in seiknes and dolour. Ane laith Lipper, ane La?arus ?e se, Requiris his grace for part of Cheritie. For Goddis lufe that creat hes all thing, And Alexanders saik of Egypt King. That he will grant me licence in his hall, To eit his meit befoir his Nobillis all. The Porter said I wonder of ?our wit, Within his hall that ?e desire to sit, For all his hall of Nobill men is fow, And thay at meit forsuith gif thay saw ?ow: Thay suld abhor, and eit that time no moir, I think it best ?e hald ?ow still thairfoir. Quod Alexander I pray ?ow of gudnes, For Goddis saik, and of ?our gentilnes. To ?our Maister ?e wald schaw my Message Get I almous ?e sall not want ?our wage. The Porter said, sa far as ?e require, For Goddis saik, and hartlie ?e desire. Zour erand do, the same I tak on hand, Quhill I returne, se still heir that ?e stand. Than the Porter past to the Empreour, And hailsit him with reuerence and honour. Did his Message, as he had gottin command The Empreour hard, and vnderstude fra hand And quhen he hard namit Alexander King, Quod he in haist that man to me ?e bring. How horribill or vgsum that he be, In all gude haist ?e fetche him heir to me. That he may eit his meit into my hall, In my presence befoir my Lordis all. Than the Porter vnto the ?et is gone, And Alexander he brocht to hall anone. And ordanit him into the hall ane place, Quhair he micht eit befoir the Empreours face Quhen he was weill refreschit at his awin wil Ane gentill man belyue he callit him till. And said gude Schir, require the Empreour, Gif that it be his will and his plesour: For Goddis lufe first, and king Alexanders sine He wald me giue ane Coup full of his wine. The gentill man said that I will do to the, Bot I beleue that sic thing sall not be. For gif ?e anis of his Coup tak ane drink, To drink thairin he sall na mair I think. Zit nor the les the erand I sall do, Auise him self gif he consentis thairto. The Message than to the Empreour he schew, And als sa sone as he the erand knew: For Alexanders saik the Coup he send Full of the wine that for the best was kend. Drank his plesure, and sine he put the rest In his Bottall, that time he thocht it best. Of his finger ane small gold Ring he drew Quhilk the Empreour lang time befoir he knew Becaus the same he had him geuin befoir, In takin of lufe and freindschip euer moir. Quhilk Alexander into the Coup leit fall, And bad the copper beir it vp throw the hall: To the Empreour, and the same leit him se, Quha said my freind, I sall it do trewlie. The Coup and Ring withouttin proces mair To the Empreour the copper sone it bair. The Empreour than how sone the Ring he saw Incontinent full weill he did it knaw. And wist richt weill it was the samin Ring, That he had geuin to Alexander King. Into freindschip quhen ather did depart, Out of the Court, quhairof he at his hart: Was sorrowfull, for he knew na remeid, Bot Alexander his companioun was deid. Or ellis he thocht this pure man meruellouslie, Had gottin this Ring at sum greit Ieopardie. He commandit the Lipper not depart Quhill he had hard mair secreitis of his hart. For he not knew be fauour na vther thing, Quhat man it was that had send him y? Ring. Efter dennar he tuik him quyetlie, And said tell me the treuth and veritie: And fen?e not to tell to me this thing, Quh?, quhair, &amp; how happinnit ?e on this Ring Alexander said, and pleis ?our Maiestie, Quhat is the caus ?e speir sic thing at me? Ze haue knawledge of this Ring I persaue, Gif it was ?ours, ?e knaw quhair ?e it gaue. The Empreour said richt wonder weill I knaw The Ring and man siclike gif I him saw. Alexander said I meruell that can be, Ze knaw the Ring, and na way knawis me. For Alexander I am of Egypt King, Sum time I was quhome to ?e gaue this Ring. Quhen he that hard to his hart straik ane sto?d For verray sturt fell flatlings to the ground. And rent his robbis, and kest his clais him fra, Quhen he persauit Alexander was sa. With sair sichingis and sobbings to him said, My deir fellow how is this on ?ow laid. Sic sair seiknes, and greit Infirmitie, My hart it brekis sic thing on ?ow to se. Ze ar my life, my saull and my weilfair, My onlie freind and fellow but compair. Quhair is ?our cors that was sa clenelie cled, Zour bauld bodie that was sa finelie fed, Zour puissant pith [and stait] that was sa stout Zour m?ly strenth, quhairof Ilk man had dout Quod Alexander this greit Infirmitie, And vnclenes that ?e se now on me: For the greit faith, trew kindnes &amp; freindschip That ?e schew quhen I left ?ow in Egypt: To wed my wife, thair ?our fidelitie Causit this seiknes sa to chance vpon me. For into bed, with my wife when ?e lay, Ane naikit sword ?e laid betuix ?ow tway Scho beleuing it was not ?e bot I, Sa fremmitlie with hir in bed culd ly. And for that caus had me at sic haitrent, Ane vther Squyer scho cheisit in luferent. Betuix thame twa purposit to poysoun me, Quhilk is conuert in this Infirmitie. Furth of my realme yai haue me dreuin &amp; chaist And to returne thairto I haue na traist. The Empreour than tuik him about the nek, For verray lufe, and said in this effeck. O my maist best belouit trew brother, Quhome euer mair I lude abone all vther. I sorrow sair in sic sort ?ow to se, Without remeid maisterit in miserie. Bot ?e mon thoill and tak in patience, And gif thair may be found ony defence: Help or remeid that may ?our seiknes saue, For gold or geir, but dout ?e sall it haue. We sall not faill to fetche fine Phisitians, With c?ning Clerkis, and perfite practicians, Nor ?it sall mis for mony Medicinars, Nor for payment to preif all Potingars. With counsallis of Maisters and doctours fine For all seiknes that can giue Medicine. Into this neid gif thay can ?ow supplie, It sall not want for gold, geir nor monie. To get ?ow help we sall not spair to spend, Thocht we suld seik vnto the warldis end. Thairfoir be blyth, and tak nathing in thocht Throw all the warld ?our help it salbe socht. Except ?our helth heir nathing ?e sall want, Quhen plesis God he will that to ?ow grant. To ane Chalmer belyue thay culd him bring, Was weill preparit, wanting na kind of thing Of honestie, nor ?it was necessair For eis or helth, quhair his bed was and lair In this meane time the Empreour gart prepair His Messingers to pas and seik all quhair, C?ning Doctouris, and Phisitians profound That was expert in ony land or ground. Of quhome thair come to him in oulkis thre, Threttie Doctouris cunning in all degre. The maist expert, and had experience, In sic effairis, belanging that Science. Of sure supplie pertening Phisick fine, And was extollit Maisters in Medicine. To quhome anone the Empreour than said, Of ?our c?ming Maisters I am richt glaid. This is the cace quhy I send to ?ow all, I haue ane freind the quhilk lyis seik and thrall Vncurabill, quhilk onlie I suspect, As is Lipper, quhairwith he is Infect. Quhairof gif ?e culd mak him haill and sound, I wald giue gold mony ane thousand pound. All the riches I haue and vther geir, I wald it giue to haue him haill and feir. The Maisteris said we sall do diligence, Be Airt, Phisick, and naturall science: Togidder with all possibilitie, Him to recure of his Infirmitie. Pleisit ?our grace ?e mon vs all pardoun, We mon haue sicht of the principall persoun. Quhilk all threttie at anis quhen thay him saw Incontinent his seiknes thay did knaw. And said it was ane seiknes vncurabill, And to remeid to mortall man not abill. Quhen the Empreour hard thame deliuer so, At his hart rute he was richt wonder wo. Remittit all to the help and calling Of God abufe, that can help all sic thing. The Empreour callit to him godlie men, Furth of all partis, quhair that he culd th? ken, That war deuoit with minde &amp; thocht Inwart Desiring thame richt humblie with his hart: That thay wald pray to God of his gude grace Throw thair prayer gif thay culd helth purches To Alex?der quhilk was ane King with croun, Be thair fasting, and als deuotioun. And als him self fastit and prayit daylie That God micht haue of his gude freind pietie. Vpon a day Alexander alone, Lying in bed, in hart all wo begone. Praying to God for sum help and supplie, He hard ane voice saying to him on hie. Alexander gif that the Empreour, Desiris thy helth, thy help and thy succour: Let him ga sone with his awin handis twa, His twa ?oung sonnis Incontinent he sla. The quhilkis his wife at ane burding th? bair, At the last time scho was in Childbedlair. Wesche thy bodie with the twa babeis blude, Thy flesche salbe als fair, als clene, als gude. As euer it was in ony time beforne, Or as the flesche of ane babie new borne. Alexander hard, and this said to him sell. I think it not neidfull this taill to tell. Nor to be schawin is not expedient, Nature thairto be na way will consent. Na wonder war his hart for to be wa, For ane stranger his awin twa sonnis sla. Thocht I be now in sic extremitie, Sic ane vane voce sall not be schawin for me. Zit not the les the Empreour nicht and day Continuallie at his deuotioun lay: Praying to God to send help and supplie, To Alexander King of Egypt suld be. Sa at the last come to the Empreour, Ane voce saying quhy makis thow mair labour For to get help to Alexander King, Sen to him self is schawin the samin thing. The Empreour than to Alexander went, Saying be blyith and mirrie in Intent. O my gude freind, sen God of his gudnes, Hes schawin remeid and helth for ?our seiknes Vnto ?our self alone sa secreitlie, I pray ?ow schaw quhat fassoun it salbe. God is remeid for all vpon him cawis, To thame supplie in sindrie sort he schawis. And sen sa is, sic secreitis hes ?ow schawin, I wald the same ?e sa mak to me knawin. To get our helth gif I micht help thairin, And to weilfair agane we micht ?ow win. I cure na Gold, nor counts na warldlie geir, Sa I agane micht haue ?ow haill and feir. I count na coist, nor ?it na vther thing. Sa ?ow agane to helth it micht ?ow bring. Hele not ?our mynd into na sort fra me, In ony thing that may ?our helth supple. For micht I deill ?our seiknes into thre, Ze suld not haue sa greit Infirmitie. My wyfe and ?e the twa part ?e suld haue, And the thrid part, my self it suld ressaue. Knew I as ?e, quhair ?e may haue support, It to ressaue, the tyme suld be richt schort, Thairfoir feir not for to tell me the treuth, To help ?our self, se na way ?e be sleuth. Than Alexander answerit with mynd sa meik, Howbeit that I fyftene tymes war mair seik: And at the poynt of the maist cruell deid, I can not schaw the caus of my remeid. Nor I wald not that sic ane thing war schawin Nor I wald not to ony mak it knawin. For to be schawin it is sa odious, And to nature sa done contrarious. In to this case ?e mon hald me excusit, To haue my helth, sic way quyte I refuse it. The Empreour said my onlie freind and brother Quhome with my hart I lufe abone all vther. Haue me in traist, haue me in na dispair, Bot the haill treuth I pray ?ow me declair. The thing is not possibill to be done, Zow for to cure, bot it salbe had sone. Thairfoir I ?ow requyre of brother heid, Hyde not fra me, that may be ?our remeid. Alexander said, sen euin sa is ?our will, The haill fassoun I will declair ?ow till. With hartlie minde, h?blie praying ?our grace Sen ?our will is, that I schaw ?ow the cace: That ?e will tak my wordis in patience, And pardoun me quhair that I mak offence. For ?e will think my wordis far by ressoun, Neid war thairfoir ?our grace grant me pardo? Wit and ressoun my talk will baith Impoung Best war thairfoir in time to hald my toung. The Empreour said for his saik that ?ow bocht Withouttin feir schaw me ?our minde &amp; thocht Ze sall me find to ?ow trew and constant, And ?ow to helth, thair is nocht ?e sall want. Thairfoir schaw furth ?our minde gif it ?ow pleis For ?e sall say nathing sall me diseis. Alexander said I will pleis ?our Intent, As it was schawin to me in verament. Zit anis agane ?our grace I will protest, That my schairp wordis ?our minde nathing molest Be ane greit voice it was to me reuelit, Be ane strange way, how that I may be halit. Zour awin twa sonnis ?our self thame for to sla And my bodie wesche with the blude of tha. This is the way quhairthrow I mon be haill, Quhilk is ane thing to ?ow vnnaturall: That the Father his awin twa sonnis suld keil With his twa handis, for ony strangers weill. And is contrair the course of naturall Law, This was the caus sic thing I durst not schaw. The Empreour said ?e faill far to me thair, That callis ?our self to be heir ane strangair. For in trew faith, and sa my saull haue seill, As my awin self I lufe ?ow euin als weill, For gif I had ten barnis perchance and ma, To get ?our helth, thair suld not ane of tha Sone be vnslane, I schortlie ?ow declair. Of this mater now we will speik na mair. Ga ?e to rest and mak na mair ado. With help of God all to gude sall cum to. The Empreour he waittit day and nicht, And watchit about quhat time yat he best micht Cum to his chak, his awin twa sonnis to sla. Sa on ane day the Emprice furth culd ga With hir Ladeis airlie in ane morning, To tak pastime into ane grene garding. The Empreour saw, and to Chalmer him sped Quhair the twa babis lay sleipand in thair bed Incontinent his quhin?ear furth he drew With his twa hands his awin twa sonnis slew Cuttit thair throttis, and sine keppit the blude, Howbeit the same contrair his hart it stude. Na meruell was howbeit his hart was wo. He thame begat, and was his children two. Sine with that blude, Alexander did wesche, With his awin hands, all his body and flesche. Quhilk was als fair Incontinent and clene, As ony time befoir had euer bene. And als gude lyke in parsoun and visage, As quhen he was bot twentie ?eir of age. The Empreour than knew weill be his cullour, Be his fassoun, his face and portratour. It was but dout Alexander trewlie, Quhairof in hart richt wonder blyth was he. For of befoir he knew bot this and so, Quhider gif it wes Alexander or no. Bot doutles Alexander he knew, Without dispair it was Alexander trew. Kist him and said, O my gude tender freind, Sen first we knew and euer mair hes bene. Of ?our persoun now I haue gude knawledge, Of ?our fauour ?our fax and ?our visage. Quhilk mony time I delytit to se, To eit and drink, and be in companie. Blyst be the time, sic childring I begat, That hes ?ow brocht to the stait ?e ar at. Bot ?it nane wist that the Childring was slane, Bot Alexander, and the Empreour allane. The Empreour said, sen God of his gudnes, Hes maid ?ow haill of all ?our sair seiknes. I sall ordane for ?ow richt quyetlie, To pas ane space, ane honest companie. Out fra this place bot aucht or myles ten, To that effect, that nane heir sall ?ow ken. And on the morne ?e sall send me message, Of zour c?ming, making to me knawledge. Than sall I cum with blyth and merie spreit Into all haist, cast me ?ow for to meit. Than still with me alwayis ?e sall remane, Quhill we auise to get ?our Realme agane. Of this counsall Alexander was content, As thay talkit, was done Incontinent. On the nixt day come to the Empreour, Ane Messinger, quha hailsit him with honour. Schawing to him, as he had gottin command King Alexander of Egypt was at hand The emprice hard and was richt wonder glaid To the Empreour scho haistit hir and said. O my gude Lord, be blyth and mak gude cheir, King Alexander thay say is c?ming heir. Quhome with we oft in greit blythnes hes bene This mony day bygane hes not him sene. And wald ?our grace be sa gude to mak gait Him for to meit, he wald be blyth I wait. I and my Ladeis into our best array Sall pas with ?ow, and meit him be the way. This being done, as ?it nathing scho knew That the Father his awin twa sonnis slew. The Empreour said, gif that it be ?our will, That Ilk Iornay blythlie I wll ga till. Than raid thay furth ane honest companie, Lords, Knichts, Ladeis, with greit solempnitie And as thay raid sa Royallie throw the streit, In the midway King Alexander culd meit. Quha hailsit vther with all humilitie, With laude &amp; gloir, and honour that micht be. Thair was kindnes &amp; thair was greit kissing, Thair was blythnes, yair was in armes bras?g Thair was kneilling, and thair was courtasie With reuerence and greit solempnitie. Efter talking with gude and trew Intent, All togidder vnto the Palice went. Quhair that he was ressauit with blythnes, With greit honour, with Ioy and mirrines. Time come of meit, all was at Tabill set, Nathing wantit that neidfull was to get. Alexander was set at the hie deis, With the Emprice, and the Empreour at meis. As thay war talking into mirrines, The Empreour said to his awin Empres: O Florentine, my awin gude wife and lufe, I think my hart in Ioy exalt abufe. That ?e do mak King Alexander sic cheir, And is sa blyth, that he is c?min heir. Scho said forsuith culd I it better make, It suld be done, for Alexanders sake. Suld not to vs his c?ming be glaidnes, And in speciall to ?ow ane greit kyndnes. For ?e had not cum to this Dignitie, Quhair ?e ar now, forsuith had not bene he. And diuers tymes als he hes sauit ?our lyfe, And was principall, that gat me to ?our wyfe. The Empreour said, ?our wit weill I allow. That thinks on thame that was sa gude to ?ow Than I pray ?ow tak gude heid quhat I say, Into this hall saw ?e not the last day, Ane laith Lipper befoir our Tabill sat, Baith meit and drink, as ?e saw sum he gat. Sine for Goddis lufe, &amp; King Alexanders sake, Desirit ane drink, quhilk I gart till him take Scho said my Lord that man richt weill I saw Ane mair vglie ?it did I neuer knaw. The Empreour said, a thing I ?ow demand, Quhilk I beleue ?e will discus fra hand. I put the cace that Lipper man had bene, King Alexander that ?e se with ?our Ene. And his remeid and helth in ?our hand lay, And with the blude of ?our ?oung sonnis tway Behude for to be bathit all about, Wald ?e not than with ane styf hart and stout; Richt weill consent that baith thair bludes war sched To the Intent, yat his helth micht be had. Thair throtts cuttit, and do thame baith to deid Sa Alexander thairthrow micht get remeid. And mak him haill, euin as ?e se him now, That I wald do (quod scho) God I auow: Had we ten Sonnis gottin vs twa betwene, I wald consent to se thame with myne Ene: Incontinent to se thame deid and slane, Into that case to get his helth agane. Thay being slane with my power and pith, My awin twa hands suld wesche him weil yair with Rather than I suld leif him in sic neid, I wald not cure to se thair throttis bleid. For God agane micht send him barnis anew, Bot neuer agane ane freind sa traist and trew. Quh? the Empreour thir words of hir hard said Into his hart he was baith blyth and glaid And said to hir gude Florentine my wife, Had ?e rather saue Alexanders life: And helit of sair nor haue ?our sonnis leuand. Trewlie (quod scho) that heir I tak on hand, Becaus thairfoir ?e ar to him sa kinde, I will ?ow schaw the Inwart of my minde. The laith Lipper quhilk sat into my haw, That I and ?e baith eit and drink we saw. Scho said he was maist Lipper La?arous, That euer come within ane Nobillis hous. I meruellit greit quhairfoir y? thing was wrocht Within ?our hall sic ane beirne suld bene brocht To ?ow I trowit it suld haue done offence, That sic persounis suld cum in ?our presence. Bot sen ?our grace sufferit sic thing to be, I was content, and weill allowit with me. The Empreour said, had ?e the treuth th? kend As I beleue, ?e had not bene offend. Gude Florentine now I will mak ?ow sure, Quhilk man it was that sat on our hall flure. I will ?ow schaw but ony fen?eing, Alexander it was of Egypt King. Quhilk at our Tabill now sittis presentlie, Quod scho my Lord, I think that can not be. Alexander that now sittis at our Tabill, That is ane thing not likelie to be abill. For Alexander that sittis heir presentlie, Is haill and feir, plesand to luik and se. Without seiknes of bodie sound and clene, Blyth of visage, with twa fair Cristall Ene, Curious of cors, ane cumlie Creature, Sa was he not that sat into the flure. Bot of his lyre was laithlie and horribill, And had seiknes quhilk was vncurabill. And sa is not now Alexander King, And I meruell ?e suld say sic ane thing. My hart (quod he) God hes send him remeid Throw me and ?ow be our sonnis deid. My hart nor hand forsuith na aw I stude, To cut thair throttis, &amp; bath him in thair blude Sa be Goddis grace he is maid haill and feir, Ane clene persoun, as ?e now se him heir. Than scho began to murne and to mak sorrow As nature wald, howbeit scho said beforrow: That scho had rather se all hir Children deid, Into that cace, or he wantit remeid. Zit not the les the naturall cours and kinde In this behalf, changeit baith thocht &amp; minde The hartlie lufe, and motherlie pietie, Quhilk nature geuis in the Mother to be. Culd not suffer, nor ?it na way sustene Bot with sair hart scho grat with baith hir ene And maid sorrow, as it was na meruall, Throw kindlie cours, and als lufe naturall. The Empreour persauit hir tak pine, To stanche hir sturt said O gude Florentine, Thocht ?e be wo, I can na way ?ow wite, For weill I knaw ?e had lufe and delite: Inwart kindnes vnto ?our sonnes two, I can weill think that ?our hart suld be wo. Zit not the les I pray ?ow ceis of sorrow All will be weill I find ?ow God to borrow. The Nurisis heirand of sic tythands, For greit hart brek thay cryit &amp; wr?g yair h?ds Thay wist nathing quhat for to do or say, Past to Chalmer quhair that the barnis lay, Beleuing weill of na vther remeid, Bot find the barnis in thair bed lyand deid. Thay fand th? baith at thair pastime playing In greit blyithnes, and geuing God louing. Neuer mair blyth sen first hour thay war borne Nathing knawing that thair twa throtis was schorne The Nurisis to the Empreour went, And how all was thay schew Incontinent How his twa sonnis was leuand blyth &amp; gla And how about baith thair twa nekis yai had Ane cirkill of gold quhair y? the knife had gane, Quhilk knife sa sone fra thame the life had tane Quhairthrow thair was greit mirth in y? Cietie In the Palice, and all the companie. That God sic grace to hir twa babs had gr?tit Thay being slane, thair lifes ?it not thay w?tit Quhairfoir thair was throw the cieteis &amp; tounis Greit prayers maid with mony Orisounis. Louing the Lord life to thir babeis lent, And grantit helth to seik and Impotent. Bankettis thay maid with Ioy and mirrines, Menstrallis maid mirth, ceissit was all sadnes. Quene Florentine scho blist that samin day, Scho did consaue and beir sic sonnis tway. Nathing was thair the space of fourtie dayis Bot al kin mirth, with blythnes sports &amp; playis Greit tornamentis, with hardie hors rynning, Sum vther dayis w? grew houndis deir hunting This being done the Empreour did prepair Ane greir armie of manheid singulair, And past away with all thair fellowschip With Alexander agane into Egypt. Set him agane into his Royaltie, In his awin Realme with greit solempnitie. Restorit him haill to all his possessiounis, With dew seruice of his Lordis and Barrounis That gude Iowell King Alexanders Quene In Adultrie that sa done lang had bene. With hir luifer, quhat he was Knicht or squire, As thay deseruit, was baith brint in ane fire. In this meane time y? Empreour ch?cit to haue Ane fair sister, quhome in to wife he gaue To Alexander, and fortifeit the band Of greit kindnes, quhilk euer mair did stand: Betuix thame twa, of hartlie minde and thocht Quhat that ane did, the vther wald haue wrocht Sa Alexander being set doun at rest, In his awin Realme, the Empreour thocht best For to returne agane to his Impire, And tuik gude nicht at thair awin hartis desire Thay war richt wa to pairt ?e may considder, Bot ?it ay still freinds may not bide togidder. Sa departit with mirrines and Ioy, Alexander on gait did him conuoy. Sine after this Alexander him drest, To gyde his Realme alwayis as he thocht best With manlines and wisdome in him sell, He vincust all contrair him did rebell. His enemeis about him all he dantit. Sa throw wisdome of his will nocht he wantit Quhen he was in all his gloir peice and micht, Into his minde it come vpon ane nicht. How his Father in the sey did him fling, Becaus he schew quhat the wilde bird did sing. And his Mother thairto did weill consent, Thairfoir he send Message Incontinent. Howbeit thay did ane far way fra him dwell, The Messinger ?it he bad to thame tell, That Alexander quhilk was King of Egypt, Wald to thame cum with ane greit fellowschip. Eit and drink, and with thame mak gude cheir In that countrie sum new nowellis to heir. The Messinger blythlie thay did ressaue, And riche rewardis siclike thay to him gaue. Saying thair seruice at euerie time and hour Suld be reddy at that greit Kingis plesour. Howbeit thay war not worthie for sic thing, For to ressaue with thame ane crownit King. Zit not the les and pleis his grace to cum, With all our hartis he salbe richt welcum. The Messinger to the Empreour is went, As thay him said he schew Incontinent. And quhat reward with blythnes yai him gaue And how blythlie the King thay suld ressaue. And how reddy thay war at his command, Him for to serue all time at hart and hand. Quhat euer his grace gaue thame c?mandem?t Quhairof the King was blyth and weill c?tent The day become the King tuik his Iornay, With diuers Lordis to pas the reddy way Quhair his Father and mother maid dwelling Vnknawin to thame of ony vther thing: Bot he was King of Egypt and nane vther, Nor ?it nane knew of his Father and Mother. Except him self quha knew weill all the cace, And quh? thay drew neir hand his fathers place As thay come furth rydand in thair Iornay The Knicht his Father met him be the way. And quhen he saw the King c?ming with croun Incontinent of his hors lichtit doun. With all honour and all gude reuerence, Vpon his kneis making obedience. And quhen he saw his Father tak sic pane, He tuik him vp, and bad him ryde agane. Sa cheik for cheik, to his Castell thay raid, Quhair thair was cheir w? all aboundance maid And quhen thay come vnto the Castell ?et, His Mother come, and with blythnes him met. Kneilling to him, he lichtit and hir kist, Bot quhat he was the suith nathing scho wist. Scho said to him sen it plesis ?our grace To vesie vs at this time, and our place. Ze do to vs ?our seruandis greit honour, And we blyth ar that it is ?our plesour. And is welcum to all that ?e find heir, And as we may we sall mak ?ow the cheir. The time of day drew neir all bownit to dine, His Father come with ane siluer Basine: With Rois watter vpon his knie kneilland, And his Mother with Towell in hir hand. Saying meiklie, plesit ?our grace to wesche, And thairefter with sum meit ?ow refresche. It is reddy the cheir we dow ?ow mak, Praying ?our grace in patience it to tak. The King this saw he smylit and sine he said Vntill him self, thair is nane can auaid, Nor set on side the godlie prouidence He will haue done be his perfite prudence. The Nichtingaillis sang now I persaue is trew Quhilk lang ago to my Father I schew: Quhen that scho come to his windo and sang, That thay suld baith be richt glaid for to gang With the Towell and Basine in thair handis, Me for to serue as thay war my seruandis. Gif I wald thoill thame sic thing for to do, Now the same thing and mater is cum to. This in him self he said, and na man knew, Nor to na man as ?it sic thing he schew. Sa he wald not thame thoill to do sic thing, Howbeit that time he was ane Crownit King, Saying schir Knicht, I will honour ?our age, Ze nor ?our wife sall do me sic homage. It bec?mis not sic twa agit to bring, Water to wesche, howbeit I be ane King. Tak in patience, forsuith I say ?ow trew, For I haue heir vther seruandis anew. Than said the Knicht to vs it war honour, Sa that it war vnto ?our grace plesour. Bot sen cace is, ?e will not thoill vs do, Be ressoun we ar not worthie thairto. Than said the King, I dude to honour age, Sic office ganis to ?ounger personage. Than to dennar was this gude King set doun, And thairefter his Lordis of greit Renoun. Quhen he was set he gart set doun his Mother On his ane side, his Father on the vther. Quhome Inteirlie beheld ay his visage, Gif thay culd haue of him ony knawlege. Bot nane thay had, seiknes, eild and laubour, Causit thame misken his fassoun and fauour. The dennar done, the King to Chalmer went, For his Father and Mother efter sent. Quha come to him with all obedience Randering to him seruice and reuerence. He commandit all persounis pas on side, Nane bot the Knicht and his wife to abide. At quhais command, as he bad sa was done, Than was the dure on thame thre closit sone. Than said the King to the Knicht and his wife Haue ?e na barnis, quod thay nane vpon life. Sone nor douchter at this time haue we nane, And to get ma, we traist the time be gane. Than said the King I speir for time bygane Had ?e ony, or had ?e neuer ane. Than said the Knicht for a sone we had ane Bot it is lang sen he was deid and gane. Than said the King, in quhat deid deit he. Than said the Knicht ane naturall deid trewlie Than said the King be that not trew but faill, Ze fault to me, and dowbillis to me ?our taill. Then said the Knicht, ?our grace now I require Quhat is the caus sa feruentlie ?e desire, And to sic thing quhat causis ?ow tak heid, With sic effect to speir efter his deid. Th? said the King, without caus do I it nocht How ?our Sone deit, schaw me ?our minde and thocht. Gif ?e will not schaw furth the veritie, Ane schameles deid but dout ?e sall baith die. Quhen thay y? hard thay fell do? on thair knie Asking him grace forgiuenes and mercie. Than said the King, ?it I will honour age, I couet not of ?ow sa greit homage. I grant ?ow leif befoir me for to stand, And sa he raist thame baith vp be the hand. To that Intent I come not in ?our place, Zow to betrais in ony sort or cace, For it is geuin me weill to vnderstand Ze put ?our sone to deid with ?our awin hand. And gif sic thing cum to the Iudgement, Ze will be baith condampnit Incontinent. Thairfoir to me the verray treuth ?e schaw, It is danger for sic to byde the Law. Schaw me the treuth, and I sall saif ?ow baith Fra all perrell, and keip ?ow fra all skaith. Than said the Knicht, my life schir to me gr?t Of the trew treuth ane word ?e sall not want. Than said the King feir not the treuth to say, And on credence heir I sall saif ?ow tway. Than said the Knicht ane sone we had trewlie, Quhilk was weill sene in cunning and Clergie Sicker cunning he had in science seuin, In all Planetis that mouit vnder heuin. He knew the cours, and all thair str?ge aspectis Thair pith, power, and all thair firme affectis. All herbis and treis richt wonder weill he knew Quhat str?th yai had, quhat pith, &amp; quhat vertew Thair was na foull y? euer flew w? wing, Bot he knew weill quh? yai yair s?g wald sing. Into sa far, thair was na herb that sprang, He knew the pith, and als the foullis sang. Vpon ane day befoir vs he culd stand, With Basine, Towell, and watter in his hand In the meane time that bony foull of flicht, The Nichtingaill, at our windo did licht. And sa began to sing hir noitis gude, Weill war the man (quod I) that vnderstude Zone sweit singing, &amp; quhat the bird dois mene Quod he Father sa ?e will not be tene: I suld ?ow schaw quhat ?one bird sings sa sweit And euerie note I sall ?ow Interpreit. Quod I deir sone, I pray the to me schaw, To say the suith of na man stand thow aw. Quod he Father, forsuith I tak greit feir, It sall ?ow craib, hir sang quhen ?e it heir. Nay, nay, (said I) of that haue thow na dout, The birds sang I pray the tell me out. Quod he ?one bird scho menis into hir sang, My Mother and ?e ar abill to leif sa lang, Quhill that ?e stand befoir me as seruandis, And to be blyth hald watter to my handis. Gif that I will ?ow suffer sic to do. Quod I that day thow sall neuer cum to. And sa at schort or euer I tuik rest, Into the sey for to drowne I him kest. Than said the King, to ?ow had bene na skaith Vnto his hands ?e had haldin watter baith. I think it had bene to ?ow baith plesour, That ?our ane sone had cum to sic honour. Than said the Knicht, that same thing I c?fes In greit furie I did it and wodnes. Wit and wisdome was went, will was ouir m? Richt and ressoun and reuth quyte fra me ran. Sa quhen wit wants and strenth of ressoun leist I count a man na better nor ane beist, That rynnis on heid and lukis to na ressoun And sa did I quhen I my Sone did droun. Than said the King, I think it was folie, Zow for to wyrk contrair the Maiestie Of God alone, and his greit prouydence, His wit his will, and michtie Ordinance Ze micht weill wit, God of his Sapience, That to ?our Sone had send him sic Science: To knaw the voce of the byrds in the Air, And it was God that causit hir to cum thair, To sing that sang, as God had hir directit, For in na sort scho micht na way neglect it. Thairfoir lat nane the man maist michtiest, Cast him to wyrk contrair quhilk God hes drest For it passis wit power and puissance, To wyrk contrair his michtie Ordinance. Now ?e sall knaw the treuth and veritie, I am ?our Sone quhilk ?e kest in the sie. And the greit God of his michtie Godheid, Hes me preseruit fra all danger of deid. And be his grace hes brocht me to this stait, As I am now and for me did debait. For his foirsicht na way can be doun smorit, Bot euer mair the same will be decorit. As worthie is for nane can wyrk contrair, His prouydence, that schairplie I declair. Than the Father and Mother heiring that, For feir and Ioy fell to the eird doun flat. Quhome he tuke vp with all humilitie, Saying Father and Mother feir not me. Haue ?e na dout of all that I haue said, Rather be blyth, Ioyus, merie and glaid. With help of God na danger sall ?ow deir, Quhat euer ?e think, I pray ?ow tak na feir. Ze sall nocht aill in geir nor in persoun, Of all bygane, I grant ?ow plane pardoun: For ?e sall fynd, that my micht and weilfair, Salbe ?our gloir, for now and euer mair, Into this lyfe, sa lang as I Indure, I haue ressoun, ?e twa me gat and bure. Sa with blythnes, with hat into his hand, He kist them baith, with merie hart lauchand. Than the Mother scho grat richt pieteouslie, And the Father the teir fell in his Eye. Than said the King, be still and weip ?e nocht, For in my Realme with blys ?e salbe brocht And with all gloir thair sall ?e honourit be With all blythnes, worschip and Dignitie: Aboue my self, except my Kinglie Croun, Quhilk is preseruit bot to my awin persoun. Sa in that place he left certane seruands, To reule &amp; gyde yair rowmes yair rents &amp; lands Tuke his Father and Mother with him hame, Quhair thay leuit still in honour and gude fame All thair life tyme quhil God to deid thame drest Gydit the Realme in Iustice peice and rest. Vnto the tyme cours was past of nature, Endit thair lyfs onlie to Godds plesure. How the Emprice was condampnit to deid. With hir Luifer, but mercie or remeid. Than Dioclesiane said to the Empreour Father this Tale I tald to ?our plesour, Quhilk I beleue richt weill ?e vnderstand. Ze euerie word (quod he) Sone I warrand, It is ane taill to be notit I say, Not ane better I hard this mony day. Than said the Sone and pleis ?our Maiestie, Howbeit that God hes geuin sic grace to me: Of wit, wisdome, and vther greit Cunning, Of diuers thingis hes lent vnderstanding. Zit this suld not na way minische ?our micht. Nor ?our honour, ?our Maiestie and hicht. Bot rather suld the same eik and augment, Be richt, ressoun, and equall Iudgement. Sa in likewise the Kingis gre and estait, Quhilk was be God onlie predestinait. Send be the bird, to sing that he micht heir, Quhilk in that cace was Goddis Messingeir For had not bene God gaue that bird sic grace, The sonnis honour, and all his dignitie, Tuik na honour fra the Father ?e se Nor to his Mother it did na hinderance Bot rather was thair honouris to auance. For as ?e hard thay war honourit alwayis, Into his Realme, during thair life and dayis Than said agane to him the Empreour, I persaue weill the sonnis greit honour: Can na way pair the Fathers micht and gloir Bot rather ay to mak it moir and moir. Thairfoir I will the haill Impire resing Into ?our handis, and ?e thairof be King. And gyde the same, and haue the reule and steir For I am auld, dow not sic burding beir. Bot rather wald be set at rest and eis, And ?e the Realme to gyde as ?e best pleis. For I dow not Indure sic besines, Be ressoun of my eild and febilnes. Than said the sone sauing ?our graces will, To that sentence na way grant will I till. Bot ?e sall ay haue the Authoritie, During ?our life, euer mair abone me, To charge, command, to bid, and for to do, In all effairis, that euer pertenis ?ow to. All besines that ar laborius, Actis and erandis, welthie and ponderus. Alwayis I will accept thame vpon me, Zow for to serue, as is my greit dewtie. And euer sall, the samin nicht and day, To ?our plesure, in sa far as I may. The Empreour than commandit his Iustice, In Iudgement sit, and do furth his office. And the Emprice in presence to gar bring, With hir Rebald cled in wemens clething Quhilk nixt hir self he causit for to stand, Than hir Ladeis in ordour at the nixt hand. Than Dioclesiane to the Empreour said, Father ?our Quene ?our honour hes degraid. Ouir all the warld ?e ar greit Empreour, And it pertenis to ?our grace and honour: To do Iustice to all the same desyris, For the same thing ?our Maiestie requyris Asweill to pure, as to the riche alway, Equall Iustice ?e suld minister ay. Now I desire that ?e giue richt sentence, On the vntreuth, falset and greit offence Done and alledgeit be the Emprice falslie, Be counsall of hir lufe in contrair me. Be quhais fals meanis seuin times furth I was led, To the Gallous to leif my life in wed. And daylie stude in greit perrell of life, And all this come throw falset of ?our wife. Als to ?our grace vnfaithfull scho hes bene Of hir bodie, not gydand like ane Quene. Quhilk is weill prouin into ?our awin presence Be manlie signes, and perfite euidence. Vpon the quhilks I ask and als desyris, Iustice and richt, euin as the caus requyris. To ?our Iustice I wald ?e gaue command, To giue sentence but dilatouris fra hand. Quhen the Emprice hard this sair petitioun, Vpon the eird than fell scho flatlingis doun. At the Empreour askit grace and mercie. Bot in na sort sic thing thair culd not be, According to the Law he bad proceid, And giue sentence conforme vnto hir deid. And bad pans weill to quh?e the deid was done Be quhome, quh?, quhair, and how lang or how sone And thairefter to mak the punischement, As pleisit the Iudge to gif furth his Iudgem?t, Than said the Iudge na way I can hir clenge For hir awin deid hir self it dois reuenge. The perfite prufe of hir Rebald and knaif, Thame self baith fylis, as all man may persaif And than the fault it is leis Maiestie, Done in contrair the Crownis dignitie. Into sa far as scho defoulit his bed, And his ane sone to Gallous gart be led. Thairfoir I giue in oppin audience, And pronouncis now for extreme sentence, That the Emprice be bound to ane hors taill, Throw all the streitis of the Cietie hir traill, Quhill scho cum to the place brint for to be, For hir prepairit, that euerie man may se, And thair with schame and lak to end hir life, In remembrance scho was ane Empreours wife And als we giue on hir Rebald sentence, For his knaifrie, and his peruerst offence: Contrair the Croun, merciles to be marterit, On the Rattis reuin, h?git, drawin &amp; quarterit And sine his flesche furth cassin to the tykis, To be deuorit with doggis vnder dykis, And with the foulis that fleis in the Air, The doggis leuingis to tak vp to thair skair. In memorie that he durst sic presume, In contemptioun the greit Empreour of Rome. This schairp sentence we pronounce oppinlie, To all pepill and dois it ratifie. Makis the same knawin to all man patent, Asweill absent, as thay that ar present. Sa war thay baith conforme to thair offence. Done and demanit, according to sentence. Geuin and prono?cit than be that awful Iuge Quhairfra remeid thay had nane nor refuge. Bot suffer deith with euerlasting schame, And ay to bruik of greit harlattis the name. As worthie was, for quhy continuall sin, With Indurit hart, euer to ly thairin: But feir of God or ony repentence, Causit thame suffer sic doly sad sentence. Howbeit that man sic baudrie did not knaw, Zit God in heuin richt weill it hard and saw. For all thing is to his Ene ay patent, Thairfoir he fand ane subtell Instrument, To mak sic thing to mannis sicht be kend, This ?e may se of this Emprice the end. Praying greit God of vs to haue mercie, And hir forgiue, Amen sa mot it be. Ane declaratioun to the Emprice after hir deid. O faithles febill fule, ô helie het hoillit hure, O poysonit paddokis pule, ô mischant mad Monsture Curst catiue creature, ô Sathans seid all schent, That euer zit wrocht nature, or zit to lyfe was lent. Quhair was thy wisdome went, quhen sic fulische thow fand, Thy lust thow may lament, that euer tuik sic on hand. Thow hes loist lyfe and land, and all thy Royall rout, Thy stait na way culd stand, it was sa stinkand stout Vpon the all cryis out, fy, fy, for verray schame, All wemens seid dois schout, vpon thy filthie name: Ay waryit be the wame, that brocht the in this lyfe Euer to bruik sic blame, wa worth the wickit wyfe: Rutit in sturt and stryfe, thy bow was euer bendit Thairfoir but sword or knyfe, thy lyfe now thow hes endit Sa greitly thow offendit, vnto ane Innocent, That thow wald neuer mend it, into this lyfe present. Thow wald neuer repent, bot wrocht wrang with Iniures, Now with schame thow art schent, heid patroun to all hures Ay quhill this warld Indures, euer to bruik that name, With all quick Creatures, with sclander lak and schame. Frons meretricis non erubescit Nec in ea voluptas nunquam senescit. Now our Emprice hes sufferit deid and gane Thairfoir as now we will let hir alane With hir harlot, quhais dayis thay haue ill sp?dit Ane Ill entrie for commoun is Ill endit. As weill appeirit in deid betuix thame tway, Of thame as now na farther I will say. Bot in all haist ga finische furth our buik, Becaus the same to do we vndertuik. Thairfoir as now mair time we will not spend Bot schaw at schort of the gude Empreours end Within few dayis efter this besines. The Empreour he tuik ane sair seiknes: As plesit God, and payit his naturall det, As the time come, and as the terme was set. Dioclesiane than tuik the steir on hand, And Empreour was of that countrie and land Reulit the Impire with wisdome and prudence Held his Maisteris in daylie reuerence. Be quhais counsall, wisdome and desire, He gydit weill his Kingdome and Impire. That he precellit all his predecessouris, In riches, wisdome, Iustice and honouris. Of his liegis sic lufe still he conqueist, That ouir all thing in eird thay lude him best. His Maisters als thay lude him ouir all thing, With all seruice, as thair trew Lord and King. Into sa far, thame self in Ieopardie Thay put oft times to saue his honestie, And sa endit thair dayis in greit honour, In Ioy and mirth, and to the greit plesour Of God alone, to quhome all honour be, Laude, praise, Impire, triumphe and dignitie. Kingdome, Renoun, and Ioy perpetuall, Louing and lufe, obedience ouir all. Helth and vertew, and euerlasting gloir, Into all warldis, baith now and euer moir. Be to that Lord with all humilitie, And to distill ane drop of his mercie On vs sinners, his gloir that we may se it To his plesure, say euerie man so be it. Finis quod Rolland. Ane schort schawing quhair and quhen, and at quhais requeist this buik was translatit out of prois in Scottis Meter. At the requeist of my Ant callit Cait, In roustie ryme this quair I did translait Of all trim termis as ?e may se denude, Becaus scho me protestit air and lait All strange termis to cast out of my gait. Saying to me scho not thame vnderstude, Requiring als that I wald be sa gude Wemens honour to hald vp and estait, As ?e may se, I durst not ellis bot dude. Sa in seuin oulkis this quair was clene c?pleit Out of plane prois, now keipand meteris feit Within the Fort and Towre of Tamtalloun, Quhen the Inglis Floit beside Inchekeith did fleit Vpon the sey, in that greit birning heit, Baith Scottis &amp; Inglis of Leith lay at y? toun, With schairp asseige, and garneist garisoun On ather side, quhair sindrie loist the sweit, That samin time I maid this translatioun. In mirrines, sen my Ant causit me mak it I ?ow require gude Reidaris for to tak it Into pati?ce, quhair falts ar fo?d correct thame Zit war I laith ouir far that it war lakit. Gif sum verse haltis, or ony cullouris crakit For my requeist tak out ane pen and blek thame Becaus for haist perchance I did neglect thame For gif sa be, I can na way defend it Excuse it self, and sa this quair is endit. Quod Rolland. 1560. The Author sayis to the Buik. IN haist ga hy the to sum hoill, And hyde the, be not callit ane buik Ga cowme the ouir all clene with coill Sone smeir the ouir with smiddie smuik, Or scour pottis to sum creischie Cuik: Or in sum kitching turne the speit: Amang Ladeis thow dar not luik For thay will on the with thair feit, For men of gude thow art not meit Thay will the hald of small auaill, Quhat restis thair than bot ?ald thy Spreit: Or to tryit Tinklaris tell thy taill. Thy roustie ryme amang thame raill For honest folk few will set by the, And I sweir by the Rude of Craill Tuitching my part heir I deny the: My counsall is, that thow gar cry the Amang Cowclinkis and commoun hures, All gude wemen thay may defy the Of all thy crakis thay tak na cures: But fond Fillokis up in the Mures Quha first ?ow reddis, Sym Skynnar hang thame Se on thame thow wirk all Iniures, Pas on and fend thy self amang thame. Quod Rolland in Dalkeith. Et sic est finis Laus detur &amp; gloria trinis.</field>
