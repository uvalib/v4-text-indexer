TO THE TRVELY WORTHY Henry Coggaine, Esquire, Master Comptroller of his Majesties Mint in the Tower of London: My humble Muse directs her dull Endeavours. To M?. Thomas Jordan on his Fancies. I read thy Fancies; wondred how Such streames of wit should from thee flow, Friend Iordan; I nere thought thy head (Like Nile's scarce yet discovered) Would so breake out; but now I am Pleas'd with the knowledge whence they came. Some Poetasters of the times, That dabble in the Lake of Rhimes; Care not, so they be in Print What sordid trash or stuffe is in't. There are too many such I feare That make Bookes cheape and Paper deare. But thou art Poesie's true sonne, The Issue of thy braine doth runne With well digested matter, thine, Are Morall some, and some Divine, Some Satyrs some love's Rapsodies, The dead live by thy Elegies. We that are old in th'art must leake, And worne with often usage breake; Thy yonger pot the Muses will With their best waters alwayes fill; When we are gone, the World shall see, A full-brim'd Helicon in thee. Tho. Nabbes. To his Friend the Author M?. Thomas Jordan, on his Varieties. I must not Iordan passe, though the waves glide with equall favour of the winde and tide: Nor for the land will I forsake the streames, On whose brow danceth flowrie Anadems. But every limbe bathing in fresh delight, Quicken the bravery of my appetite, I scud amid'st the Curles, and with my palme, Stroake the delicious waters in a calme, Whose vertues are more powerfull in their birth, Then all the distillations of the earth; To sip of this from Cupids hollow hand, Creates effects more strange then dart, or brand: Quaffe Candid Reader, but dull clots be gone, For Iordan's waters, are pure Helicon. Ed. May. On my Friend and adopted sonne M?. Thomas Jordan the Infant-Poet of our Age. From smallest Springs, arise the greatest streames, Thou hast begun well; who dares hinder thee Still to goe forward, and dilate thy beames, T'acquaint the world with thy sweete Poetry. Speake still in tune, hide not thy worth but shew it, That men may say, th'art borne not made a Poet. And he that fayles thy growing Muse to cherish, May his fixt hopes in expectation perish. Thine (sance Complement) J. B. POETICALL VARIETIES. A Gentleman in love with twenty Mistresses. I prethee leave me love, goe place desire In those cold hearts that ne're felt Am'rous fire, Or let me be thy Martyr, let me burne Till I am nought but ashes, and my urne Translated to some common Spicerie, May serve thee more then thy Artillerie. Coy Madams tasting me in their hot spice, Shall feele more flames then all the learn'd advice Of Esculapius can alay, though he Descend from Heaven to teach new Mystery; If this may not be granted, let me crave As many hearts as flames, then shall I have A multitude of fayre-ones; Then I may Enjoy my Rosa, spend the Am'rous day Within her armes, and at the night retire To Violetta, quench another fire In her cold bosome, but ere day doth rise Salute the Morne in my Aurora's eyes: There like to an Idolater ile gaze Till my Honoria rids me of the maze And draws me to her Bower, where having spent Some heavenly houres, ile finde out Millescent (That wonder of perfection) we two, Can teach the Turtles what they ought to doe; With kisses moyst her Ruby lips ile cover. But then Castara sayes doe not love her; Who with a witty sweete indulgent smile Tells me I doe forget her all this while. Then doe I kisse and study to excuse, But yet am strait instructed by my Muse. Bellara wants me, theres a minde as faire And beautifull as all the other Are: In their externall features, such a one Might have perswaded desperate Phaeton, To have forsooke his Chariot; her I love Next to my Beades, till Fancy bids me prove My chast Eliza, in her Virgin brest, Lyes farre more worth then Poets have exprest. In painting out Pandora, I confesse I honour her as I doe happinesse; But not like my belov'd Beata, shee Can give instructions to Mortalitie, How we may scape Hells fatall fire and come, To (loves blest Paradise) Elizium; Except Thalia (one as faire and kind) Perswad's us to be of another minde; Makes us beleeve Elizium is a place But feign'd unlesse it be in her embrace. Where I could ever rest, thence never part Would Eglentina send me backe my heart, Yet such sweete chaines of love shee binds it in, That should I thinke to loose, twould be a sin To great for Absolution, I must rest Untill Dulcella (not more faire then blest) Please for to give release, in her it lyes To make me hug my owne deare perjuries; And yet shee knowes Ambrosia being by I can neglect her and her potencie. Ambrosia can conduct my happy feete To Columbina (shee that is more sweet Then natures perfum'd violet) he that knowes Her sweetnesse, as I doe, will say the Rose Breaths but contagion, yet Candora shall Maintaine though shee be sweet, shee has not all Kind nature did bestow, for in her brest Arabiahs, and the chast Phænix nest. Must I though lose Fidelia and deny My faith to Anabella, let me dye When I remember not the sacred love Twixt me and my Musea; The fond Dove Affects not like Lucella, they are all So faire, so sweet I know not which to call My best or happiest, for unhappy I, Must love but one of all, or by love dye; Ile leave all therefore, and my selfe encline To court Vrania, shees a love divine. A Gentleman's deploration for his Mistresse, falling from Vertue. Patience, inhabit humble soules; extend Thy passive power to those whose sorrowes end; Mine are eternall, powerfull, and immense; Such as may teach thee wrath fond Patience; Ixion's wheele is easie, and the stone Sissiphus rowles he doth but sleepe upon, Compar'd to mine; The greatnesse of my wrongs Would want Oration, though an hundred tongues Guided by fluent Orators, should dare In thrifty speech but briefly to declare; They would destroy all Memories, all Sence, And drive all Language from Intelligence. Thou that art rich in sorrow, and canst sweare Thou hast more then Mortality can beare. Attend, and give me audience, I will shew Thy quaking sense what thou shalt feare to know; Thou wilt beleeve (if I at large declare) Sorrow hath tane her dwelling in thy Eare. And thinke thou mayst with lesser patience Endure thy wrongs, than give mine audience. Felina's falen from vertue; shees acute In learned Levitie, turn'd Prostitute. I lov'd her dearely, while her eyes were pure, While she blush'd innocent, and kiss'd to cure. When smiles were modest ensignes, while her breath, Carried more balme then poyson, life then death; When shee weep'd honest greefe; and I did see, Her Salutations were humilitie; Then was shee perfect Virgin; then did I Contract my heart to this Idolatry. Her eyes doe now looke glorious, but to tell Vnhappy man, the fairest way to Hell. Shee blushes now for guilt, smiles to doe ill, Breath's but to poyson, kisses but to kill; Weep's to ensnare, salut's but to destroy, Flatters to ceaze, imbraceth to betray; Betrayes to get no profit, or renowne, But falls her selfe, to plucke another downe. Oh false Felina, must your beautie be Expos'd to Incest, and Adulterie. You are a Whore, and tis the choysest name That he will render, who first caus'd your shame; Sometimes you are his Mistresse, when his lust Hath itching Feavers, and must take on trust, But having done hee loaths ye, nay will sweare, Tis you that made him turne Adulterer. Perhaps youle then repent and thinke on me, (That onely priz'd you for your puritie) Resolve to be reserv'd, and never looke Vpon (that dangerous forbidden Book) Incontinence. Then doth another come, Who gives your penitence a Martyrdome, Whom you embrace with such an appetite, As if you had beene kept from your delight An age of houres; you deities (that see Such shipwrack made of divine puritie) Lend me your perfect patience, or I feare My sorrow will become my murtherer, Release me of the contract that I vow'd Vnto Felina; Let her not be proud Of my undoing too, that I may beare My sorrowes like a man, and let my care Be to admonish those that meane to wed, No path so full of danger man can tread, Let not fraile beauty, (thats the rode we passe; Be much ador'd; faire my Felina was. Let not your Mistresse wealth or wit surprize, For faire Felina was both rich and wise. And let not blushes Ladies vertues tell, Felina was once Chast, and yet shee fell. To his Mistrisse Philonella, being at her Looking-glasse. My sweetest Philonella, turne away From that Angelick figure, lest you pay An adoration to your shade; your eye May win an Hermit to Idolatrie. Admit your soule be better guarded, know I have still cause for doubt, lest some rash vow (Made in an amrous extasie) should tye Your selfe to your faire shade eternally, Which heaven defend, when you bring this to passe. Be kind you powers, translate me to her glasse, That when the currall creatures come to give Their daily tribute to me, I may live The glory of a lover, and enjoy More kisses then Adonis (Mirrhas boy) Oh but some danger will pursue this blisse Love is a feeding Feaver, and each kisse Creats another appetite, Alas I shall become your beauties burning glasse. Sad lovers will relate, (should you expire) Narcissus dyed by water, you by fire, Both for one Amorous folly; yet (as he Is now a Flower) could you a Phœnix be, And I the sweete Arabian tree, so blest With the rich treasure of your spicie nest; Most willingly I should desire the blisse, Of so divine a Metamorphosis. Apollo sure would leave his Daphnean tree, (With Lyrick Ayres) to keepe us company. But these are fancies, leave your glasse, I vow, You are to me a better Phœnix now. To Clora a farewell, once his coy Mistresse. Clora farewell, you may be cruell now And keepe the never-violated vow You made unto your goddesse; I am free As the great Monarch, whose large Emperie Containes a thousand Regions, I can sit Viewing your beauty, yet betray my wit Vnto no greater folly; I can say Your cheekes are Iuly Roses, and the day Borrowes its radiant lustre from your eyes, And yet retaine my owne; I can be wise; I doe disdaine the power that made me turne Apostata to reason; and doe burne With a devoute vexation, I should spend My pretious time to such a thriftlesse end As to be your Admirer, therefore when You shall dispute the follies of yongmen, Let me intreate you, (though it raise your fame High as Diana's selfe) you will not name Me'mongst your captiv'd servants, lest that I Ruine that fame, and you repenting dye. To Leda his coy Bride, on the Bridall Night. VVhy art thou coy (my Leda) ar't not mine? Hath not the holy Hymeneall twine Power to contract our Natures? must I be Still interpos'd with needelesse Modesty? What though my former passions made me vow You were an Angell; be a Mortall now. The bride-maides all are vanish'd, and the crew Of Virgin Ladies that did waite on you, Have left us to our selves; as loth to be Injurious to our loves wish'd privacie. Come then undresse; why blush you, prethee smile; Faith ile disrobe ye, nay I will not spoyle Your Necklace, or your Gorget; Heres a Pin Pricks you (faire Leda) twere a cruell sin Not to remove it; Oh how many gates Are to Elizium? (yet the sweetest Straits That e're made voyage happy) here's a Lace Me thinks should stifle you; it doth embrace Your body too severely, take a knife, Tis tedious to undoe it; By my life, It shall be cut. Let your Carnation gowne Be pull'd off (too) and next let me pull downe This Rosie Peticote; What is this cloud That keepes the day light from us, and's allow'd More priviledge then I? (Though it be white) Tis not the white I aime at (by this light) It shall goe off (too) noe? then let't alone, Come, let's to bed, why look you so? here's none See's you, but I; be quicke or (by this hand) Ile lay you downe my selfe; you make me stand Too long i'th cold; Why doe you lie so farre, Ile follow you, this distance shall not barre Your body from me; Oh, tis well, and now Ile let thy Virgin innocence know how Kings propagate young Princes, marriage beds Never destroy, but erect mayden-heads: Faire Virgins, fairely wedded, but repaire Declining beauty in a prosperous heire. Come then, lets kisse, let us embrace each other, Till we have found a babe, faire (like the mother.) Such face, brest's, waste, soft belly, such a—why Doe you thrust backe my hand so scornefully? Youle make me strive (I thinke) Leda, you know, I have a warrant for what ere I doe, And can commit no trespasse; therefore come Make me beleeve theirs no Elizium Sweeter then these embraces—Now ye are kind, (My gentle Leda) since you have resign'd, Ile leave my talking (too) lovers grow mutes When Amrous Ladies grant such pretty sutes. A Paradox on his Mistresse, who is cole Blacke, Blinde, Wrinckled, Crooked and Dumbe. VVhich of thy vertues shall I first admire, (Rare peece of natures wonder?) O inspire My over-Amorous soule, yee Virgins nine That blesse the fount of flowing Hippocrene: Create a fancy in me, that may flye Above the towring head of Rapsody. Negra, thou art not faire; I cannot say The blushing morne (bright Herald to the day) Riseth in either Cheeke; nor yet suppose The blamelesse Lilly and chast bashfull Rose Have a contention there, for these (we know) Change with their seasons, they but bud, and blow, And then expire for ever; all their story Is at an end, when they begin their glory. But thou art Black, and therein lovely (too) Constant, as Fate, unto thy changelesse Hue, (Like to thy inward soule) where we may finde Thy face to be fit Emblem to thy mind, Constant in all chaste thoughts; and a black night Sometimes allowes more pleasure, then the light Of a cleare Summer morning, when we please To dedicate our wearied braines to ease On a soft Pillow; Marriage-beds allow The night for lovers actions and (we know) That, ere the seasons of the yeare decay, Night claim's as much of rule, as doth the Day. Thy Blacknesse is thy happinesse; by thee The paint of white and red Adulterie Can have no entertainement; all mens eyes May trust thy face, for it brookes no disguise; Thou need'st no Scarfes, no Black-bags here prevaile, Thy face is both thy Beauty and thy Vaile. Wert thou not blind (some say) thou wouldst despaire, For being so, thou thinkst thy selfe as faire As Helen was, but those are fooles, and know No reason to alleadge, untill I show The perfect truth; thou doest reserve thy eyes But to looke inward, where true beauty lyes. Thou lookst not on vaine glory, idle toyes That mocke the sence, and are not reall joyes, But lights that lead to misery; In thee It is a vertue that thou canst not see. Some call the Wrinckled (Negra) and are bold To tell me that my Mistresse is as old As twice my age, (Thus all seeke to beguile Thy pretious worth) each wrinckle is a smile, (Had they my eyes to see) Then, they would know (If they be smiles) why they continue so; I answer'd that those smiles are alwayes shewne, To tell thou still art friends with every one. So art thou termed crooked, cause they see Thee (like the figure of Humility) Still bending to the earth; but thou art wise And wilt salute all creatures (since thy eyes Deny thee to make choyse) twere better be Alwayes so bent, then lose humillity. Then doe they call thee Dumbe, (alas) because Thou art not frequent in the talking lawes Of idle women; must the cruell throng Of ranke backbiters say thou hast no tongue? Admit thou hast not, tis not thy intent That thy chast silence should give free consent To every motion; then they wonder what Thou movest thy head, or point'st thy fingers at, These were Enigmaes to them, till I told The meaning, and the Riddle did unfould, That none but they, who in thy thoughts abode, Can understand the vertue of thy nod. So, art thou none but mine; for onely I, Retaine the knowledge of that mystery, And I am thine, who (spight of envious mocks) Will marry thee—by way of Paradox; No otherwise (beleeve me Negra;) so Ile lye with thee, and beget children too. Thus you that marry ill, and live worse lives, (Like me) make Para-doxes of your wives. A Dialogue betwixt Castadorus and Arabella in bed. Arabella Deare Castadorus let me rise Aurora gins to leere me, Shee tells me I doe wantonize, Castadorus. I prethee sweete lye neere me. Let red Aurora smile my deere And Phœbus laughing follow, Thou onely art Aurora here Let me be thy Apollo. It is to envie at our blisse That they doe rise before us, Is there such hurt in this, or this; Arabella. Nay fye, why Castadorus. Castadorus. What, Arabella can one night Of loving dalliance tyre yee? I could lye ever (if I might). One houre let me desire yee. Arabella. Fy, fy, you hurt me, let me goe If you so roughly use me, What can I say, or thinke of you; I prethee (Love) excuse me. Castadorus. Thy beauty and my love defend I should ungently move thee, Tis kisses (sweete) that I intend, Is it not I that love thee? Arabella. I doe confesse it is, but then Since you doe so importune, That I should once lye downe agen, Vouchsafe to draw the Curtaine Aurora and Apollo (too) May visit silent fields, By my consent they nere shall know The blisse our pleasure yeelds. To his faithlesse Mistresse Vxoria. Where was I, when I cald my mistresse faire As the bright East (when clouds dispersed are To the vast North) how did I grossely erre, When (rashly confident) I durst preferre Her vertue boye Dianas! when we met, Why did I thinke the coole lip't Violet Kiss'd not more chastly sweet, or did suppose Her cheekes begat a colour in the rose! But (worst of all) what madnesse Seaz'd my sence When I conceiv'd her craft, pure innocence! Yee men of happy soules, (I meane) that be Vnblasted with the breath of perjurie Proceeding from fraile woman; keepe ye so, Or you will finde, earth cannot beare a foe So full of killing mischeife; all that prove Embrace their ruine, and yet call it love. Oh in what Chaos did that Caytiffe dwell, That taught the Age so good a word for Hell! Because your Mistresse eyes starrelike appeare, Will you blaspheming cry that Heaven's there? Tis melancholly madnesse, and Ile prove You are seduc'd by sorcery not love, Her heart is deepe perdition; can her eye Retaine one part of Heaven, Hell so nigh? I am experienc'd, read your Fate in me, Let Adam's tasting the excluded tree Worke feare in you; good Angels tongues forbid That you should lose your Eden as we did. Women have subtle slights, theile tell ye then, What Evah lost, Mary restor'd agen, Producing all her virgin purity To be their honour, though impiety Distracted into Arrogance, and lust Engrosse their soules and bodies, yet they must In the blacke booke of their lives fatall story Write for their owne, the Virgin Maries glory. Such false Vxoria is, but if there be A woman Phœnix let her pardon me, Shee was excluded, when shee knowes my wrong, I know sheele be too just to blame my tongue, And thus conceive, what vertue can he finde In any woman, hath his owne unkind? To her perjur'd Love Maritus, her dishonorer. Oh my undoing faith, now I repent My hope ere gave my charity consent To be thy love Maritus, couldst thou spy Within the Sphere of my transparant eye One Cupid loosely revell to invite Thy soule to so unchast an appetite That for its satisfaction I must dye, Kild in my inocence by perjury? Oh false Maritus I have heard you tell That in my eyes two purer Cherub's dwell, Then those that guard Elizium; and my lip So chastly coole, that should a Letcher sip, He might convert to Angell; my hands touch To a more guilty person doe as much. What worser thing are you, these vertues can Convert them Angells, and not you to man; Have you a soule? do you beleeve it must (When to some urne you have resign'd your dust) Have any residence? doe you not feele In your wide conscience, that Ixions wheele The Poets paint for Morall, yet agree To take his torment as one worse then he? Repent, sigh, weepe (Maritus) your wilde youth Hath murther'd innocence, and wounded truth Whilst I stand my owne statue, and my eyes Write this in teares— HERE MY DEAD HONOR LYES. A vow to his inestimable Mistresse. By the two Rosie blushes that did move In your chaste cheekes when I reveal'd my love, By those Favonian sighs whose gentle calme Perfum'd the Ayre sweet, as Iudean balme, By those two Ruby Portalls, that disclose Two Hemispheres of Pearle, contriv'd to pose The yet amaz'd beholder, by your eyes, Brighter to me then Titan when he flyes Over Arabian mountaines ere his heate Doth cause the toyling rurall Negro sweate Vnder his spicy burthen, by your haire, Which pardon sweetest if I terme a snare To catch a Cupid in, and falling low Into your bosome where the banks of Poe Shew nurseryes of Lillies, I protest With a chast kisse upon your virgin brest (Love's sacred register of vowes) in thee My love and life hath chose eternity; Yet take my countervow this zealous kisse I will be true—so Angels meete their blisse. A Dialogue betweene Icarus and surprized Phillida. Phil. Pretty sweete one looke on me Faine I would thy captive be, Bound by thee is libertie. Icar. Be not so unkindly wise For your lookes will bribe my eyes To divulge where my heart lyes. Phil. If they doe, thou needst not feare, By my innocence I sweare, Ile but place another there. Icar. Thats my feare I dare not prove Nor my resolution move, Cause I know you are in love. Phil. Lov'd Icarus and if I be I know I cannot injure thee, Love and beauty will agree. Oh you doe my hearing wrong, I have turn'd my eyes thus long To be captiv'd by your tongue. Then my houres are happy spent, If my tongue give such content It shall be thy Instrument. But be sure you use it then Thus unto no other men, Left that I grow deafe agen. Loves progresse. Love is my honest character; I am The child of a faire mother, and I came From yon' celestiall Pallace, to surround This universe, I did so, and have found My deity ador'd by all, I was Their onely Genius; brought all acts to passe; I enter'd a great Citty where I spy'd A fourescore Bridegroome and a sixteene Bride, Going to Hymens Temple, though her eye Look'd but disdainefull of his Gravity (Shee was compeld) I pittying the wrong Shot a sharpe shaft, shee lov'd, and he grew young; This was my first effectuall worke and then I met a venerable Cittizen, A Vsurer, well troubled with the strife Of worldly cares, and yet without a wife; I made him wed his maide, and breake his store For pious uses, to maintaine the poore. I interrupted (next) the serious Muse Of a sad Student, busy to peruse The hearts of mineralls, who let gold flye To purchase glasse, and practise Alchimy; I did infuse a Quintessence that made My wise Philosopher mistake his trade, Dazeld his fancy so, that he did spie Faces and lips in his Philosophie; Sweete Roseat blushes, smiles, choyse locks of hayre, Soft fingers, and such eyes as women weare; When all was perfected in every part A Lady was th'Elixir of his Art. Love is a Courtier (too) I went to Court, There did I see a generall resort Of royall persons, Dukes, Earles, Lords and Knights, Each one his Lady, and most choyce delights Vshering their pompe; the Virgin Ladies (too) Frequent that Senat, who prepare to doe Their amrous rites to love; the youthfull squires Neglect no office that may keepe the fyers Of Cupid ever burning; yet mongst these Diana had a vestall did displease My angry soule; shee was a virgin faire As lovely Psyche; in her trameld haire Hung pretious Diamonds, yet might you spie No lustre in them, cause her eyes were by, And to reveale her fully, I durst sweare I had beheld another Venus there. This Lady was belov'd ador'd and sought By a rich heyre, (that as much vertue brought As shee had beauty) in whose soule did move The divine graces, yet he was in love With this coy peece of Ladyship; but shee Contemn'd as much, now note the destinie, I could not brooke her humour, but did burne With hot vexation; which did suddaine turne To royall madnesse, and in zealous rage I made him wed a Countesse, shee a Page. Thus did I traverse earth, and now am come To rest my tyr'd limbs in Elizium. To his most excellent Mistresse, Avis Booth. Melpomene, forget thou art a Muse Or in thy tragicke braine a juice infuse May keepe thee sleeping, let Thalia bring From greene Parnassus, plenty of that spring Inspires our Laureat Lovers; could I prayse Lov'd Avis to her worth, I might weare Bayes Throwne from faire Daphne's armes bedew'd with teares, For greefe all others are her ravishers. Who but beholds her cheekes and not supposes December to be Iune, there live such Roses; Here would I rest, should I ascend her eyes, Tis fear'd my owne would be their sacrifice; Ile leave particulars lest I should wrong Those that must nere enjoy her, if my tongue (Made eloquent by her) could but declare Each beauty fully, love and sad despaire Would execute all hearers, there would be A civill warre twixt faith and Piety; Since sheele breed ruine if I should discover Ile draw the Curtaines close; but let no lover Compare his Mistresse to her, lest that I Describe at large, and he by surfeit dye, Such vertue hath her beauty, for shee is A Rara Avis, and my faire Mistrisse. Achrostick to his Mistresse. Sweete Soule of goodnesse, in whose Saintlike brest Vertue Vowe's dwelling, to make beauty blest; Sure Sighing Cytherea sits, your eyes Are Altars whereon shee might sacrifice; Now None will of the Paphean order be; Natur's New worke transcends a deity; Arabia's Aromatticks court your scent; Bright Beauty makes your gazers eloquent, Let Little Cupid his lost eyes obtaine (Vayl'd) Veiwing you would strike him blinde againe; Nay Never thinke I flatter, If you be Thus To none else (by love) you are to me. A Gentleman desirous to have his Lady's Picture drawne, describes her thus. Ingenious Artist teach thy Pencill how To paint a goddesse, I would let thee know I have a Mistresse thy admired Art Must limne like my description; doe no start If I command a worke above thy skill And send thee once more to Parnassus hill To heare Thalia's Lectures; have you seene The lovely feature of the Cyprian Queene, Her cheekes resemble somewhat; though each Rose In her's seemes pluckt, and my Aurelia's growes; Yet they may passe; the Lillyes that doe stand Upon her breasts, tells you my Mistresse hand Is patterne to their whitenesse; let her eyes Not want that heavenly vertue to surprize Onely my heart, let them be lov'd by none Whose glories are to captive every one. Tis onely my ambition for to be Fit for my Mistresse, and shee fit for me. But to my first description; for those haires Adorne her head, paint them Diana weares; And let her forehead not inferior be To that which shewes great Iuno's majestie, Let those two Rosy portalls, that I call Her ruby lippes, be but so magicall As his her owne, so sweet, so balmie made, Sure I shall leave the substance for the shade. If you thinke these Enigma's and that I Strive but to pose you with my Poetry; Making an argument you never saw Such goddesses fayn'd by Poetick law: I answer such divine powers you shall see Get but a Mistresse, be in love (like me) Chaste Love sitting under a Grove of yong Bay-trees, is thus solicited by Lust. VVhat? sighing Love, for shame arise Sit not crosse-arm'd, (by Venus eyes) Thou doe'st thy passion Idolize. Ile bring thee to a Mistresse, faire As Lillyes when they first prepare To kisse the Amorous morning ayre; Shees as active as desire, Her voyce transcends the Mermaids quire; In each touch glowe's Cupids fire. Corinthian wantons whose rare merits Were in raysing leaden spirits, My choyse Mistresse brest inherits. Cold Anchorites, (prepar'd to mourne Their past crimes) should they but turne Their eyes on her; would (gazing) burne; And in that scorching extasie Not desire to be set free, But wish to burne eternally. How can shee but so surprize The chaste hearts of th? most wise, Cupids heaven is her eyes. Yet if yours whom you doe keepe Charie as your thoughts in sleepe, For whom you nightly pray and weepe, Be so faire, so kind, so loving, So attractive, sweete, and moving, Let me know her by your proving. Love. I have a Mistresse chaster farre, Then thine is faire, shall be a starre, When shee is in a Sepulcher. With the harmony divine Angels limbs with Angels twine, As does her white soule and mine. We can kisse without desire, Enjoy our sweets, and feele no fire To enflame, or yet expire. Divinity it selfe may see, In her soules faire Symmetry, What Religion ought to be. In her eyes an Anchorite may Make purer his Religious Clay, And to heaven tread the way. I am chast Love, not confin'd To your fayned Archer blinde, But adore a vertuous minde; And whoever will deny Sensuall Lust, and doe as I, Shall ever love, and never dye. What a Whore is. Nature's unhappy workemanship; if Faire So much the worse, all mischiefes doubled are: If Modest, ther's a hell in her intent, Shee kills secure, when shee seemes innocent: If coy and nice, take heede, it is a slight, Shee useth but to strengthen Appetite: If witty, in her power more dangers lye, Shee'le give you Logick for Adultery, Prove lust legitimate; at last beguile Your easy sense with a deluding smile, More subtle then her Logick; in such wayes Shee spends her pretious nere returning dayes. (The glory of her youth) And (which is worse) Had shee Helena's beauty, yet the curse, Of Strumpets will attend her; sicknesse seases Her over-charged body, and diseases, Will understand no Phisicke, but prepare Her limbes for earth, ere a repentant Prayer Can cherish her lost soule; Thus shee defloure's Her living kindred and dead ancestors Of all their fertile fame, so buried lyes, A pittifull example to the wise; But those whom shee abus'd in life will laugh Her finall fall, and curse an Epitaph. An abused Man: Quasi, a Cuccold. Yee Gods that lend me Patience, tell me why My guiltlesse fame (pure as your Piety) Must suffer for its innocence; can fate For vertuous men such ills predestinate: Ist not enough you have confin'd my life To the loath'd prison of an unchast wife; Extinguish'd Hymens Tapers, and bespread With Ewe and Cypresse my poore nuptiall bed, But I must suffer the injurious wrong And Contumelie of each idiots tongue, Take the reproach of him (perhaps) that thrives In his warme Plush by nought else but his wives (Thrice bought) adultery, yet such as he Must on my Patience brand his Calumny: Teach wiser men, and such as know the price Of a chast wife, It is a Paradise All candid soules enjoy not, if they doe, Yee are unjust, my merits claime one (too) But I repent my rage, conceive agen The reason why you punish vertuous men; To make it in their suffering appeare They must attend, their heaven is not here; Yet tell my rude abusers onely this, Not my unkindnesse causeth her amisse, Nor is it poverty my torment brings, For such as mine may be the fate of Kings. Lust loseth all. Lvst (The hot mother of unchast desires, Blacke spotted feavers and destroying fires) I must take breath to curse yee, for I see My ruine will be perfected by thee, Why do men call thee love, when as no hate Retaine's a Plague, maks man more desperate: Thou rob'st him of all honour, mak'st his name Become the onely title of a shame; Oh may thy fawning falsehood nere have rest Within the confine's of a noble brest. All the choice vertues, that I ere could boast My soule enjoy'd, insatiate lust hath lost: Religion bid me first farewell, for I Behold no beauty in Divinity; Then wisedome left the mansion of my minde To follie's trust (who never was enclin'd Vnto chast lawes) I did not wisedome misse, Wealth can obtaine a lustfull Mistresse: But soone as wisedome from my soule did slide, Reason remov'd and bad me seeke a guide, Which thus I did, my present fancy flyes Vnto the daylight of my Mistresse eyes, Which being darken'd by divine decree, I lost my way, and was as blind as shee: But when Religion, Wisedome, Reason went, Faith left me (too) and with a firme consent Her sister Hope did follow, both agree To heaven to transport kind charity; Love lost his labour in me, for unjust I did convert his civill lawes to lust. Honor declin'd, saying it is not right Man should be servant to his appetite: Manhood exild himselfe and would not owne Me nor my acts, I was all Woman growne. Who thinks I am no loser? who will say Hee's not undone that hath no more to play? Let no man then expose his life and fame He must needs lose, the divells in the game; He that buyes pleasure at so deare a price Obtaine's an apple to lose Paradise. A Dialogue betwixt Adversus and his Mistresse the Lady Contra. Adver. Fayre Contra, in the bosome of yon shade Remaynes a soft repose, by nature made To give your beauty welcome, tis a Bower Solicited by every fragrant Flower Nurs'd in this Rosy Province, shall I crave I may conduct you to it, (sweete) I have A gentle story to reveale, so deare Vnto my selfe, that none but your chast eare May heare the petty volume, be but pleas'd To fit and heare and my desire is eas'd. Contra. You will not kill my patience or betray My eares to some loose fancy, from what Play Have you traduc'd your story? is it new, Decently delectable, strange and true? What title hath your story? may it be Heard without teares? comes it off merily? Tis cald a Game at Hearts, both strange and new; The losers win if both the hearts play true. This is a riddle sure, some fine defeate, You have compos'd to give my wit the cheate. There is a man—thats I—his heart doth vow Vnto a vertuous Lady—that is you. Be not offended fayrest, this is all The story I can tell or ever shall, I love you; love you dearely, in your eye Lives my devotion, theres a deity So powerfull, that is calls my early eyes From practick Prayer to give it sacrifice. I love you chastly, my divine desire Aymes but at honord marriage, all the fire Love (the great king of passions) did create Within my brest, is as immaculate, Temprate and pure as the bright flame that flyes In zeale from an accepted sacrifice. Is this your stories end? is your game don? Where be your losing winners? who hath won? The heart that never play'd, play then and be A double winner, ile lose all to thee. Indeede I cannot love, or if I doe, Credit me Sir, I cannot fancy you, You are to full of passion, if you can Exile it from you and turne merry man, You may obtaine my favour, but if not Your game is done, your story quite forgot. Adver. Oh the blind curse of lovers it doth make Man become Idiot for his mistresse sake, But I disdaine the taske and let you know (Your superficiall fayre-one) that I bow No to the feature of your femall kind, But to a brest enrich'd with a faire minde; If yours be so, I love you, but if not, My love (like to my story) is forgot: Must I become a Zane, laugh and toy, Your ever-losing favour to enjoy; Doth your wise Ladiship conceit it fit, I should implore the vertue of your wit With idle mirth, reserv'd for wanton guests, Or must I plead my marriage love in jests? Tis a severe conjunction that doth tye Two soules in one unto eternity, And requires serious wisedome, such as may Keepe the knot tyed more then the marriage day; Perhaps you are engag'd, your heart doth dwell Within anothers, love him then—farewell. Contra Sola. Thus Virgins sport away their loves, thus I Have at one blast lost more felicity Then many Queenes can boast, some pittying fate Contrive a meanes I may be fortunate In his lov'd love agen, Oh be so kind To render me the object of his minde; If your strickt Canons this request deny, And that your sentence tells me I must dye For my transgression, I no mourners crave, But let some Zane laugh me to my grave; No Epitaph be writ nor yet a stone With this Inscription, Heere lies buried One, Lest my lost Love should come, and when he spies My Sepulcher with pitty lose his eyes. Rara Avis in terr is nigroque Similima Cigno. Flye, flye my nimble Genius round about The peopled world, find me this Riddle out, There is much doubt int, to the City flye Amongst the Femall Beauties, where each eye Begets a gazing admiration; there Chuse me a young Wench that doth know shees faire, Who in Thought, Word, and Deed is chast, and yet Hath beene thrice tempted by Wealth, Worth and Wit. In the same City doe the best you can By narrow search, to spye me out a Man Wedded to Femall follies, yet shall be The Cities Lord Major for his Gravity. Repaire to Court, you shall a Lady see Deck'd like Aurora in choice Bravery, Winne her from those delights, see if you can Perswade her Ladiship turne Puritan. Perchance shee hath a husband, one that is Of youthfull mettall, can Dance, Sing, and Kisse, Court amorous Ladies, is compleatly faire, That owes to Art for a large crispy haire. Produce him (too) he with the rest may passe If he did nere behold a Looking-Glasse, Take Cart and to the Country goe with speede, Where Clownes, Cowes, Calfes, Sheepe, and fat Oxen feede, Perswade some great Corne-master, that hath bin A Grand Offender in the thriving Sin Of Transportation; onely to refraine That thrifty course, and give his Country Graine, Bid his Old wife forsake her Country tongue, And trade in Complement, tell her shees young; If you can make her leave her Country Iigge, Shave off her Haire and weare a Periwigge, Bring her, and all the rest, I dare say than I have as Rare a Bird, as your blacke Swan. To his Mistris Elizabeth Brooke. Elizabeth inspire me, then I shall Write nought obscene, but Beauty, Vertue all. There was a Queene of whom Fames tongue can tell Cald Vertue Servant, shee did all Excell, Durst call themselves Elizabeth; to me, Methinkes you keepe her still in Memorie, Did I not thinke you chaste, as is the Snow Girt in Diana's girdle, faire one know I could not court you, though your beauty might Play the faire thiefe, and steale me at first sight, I should affect no longer then I gaz'd: Beauty and Vertue both make Soules amaz'd Be you my Brooke, my shadow, and I vow Like fond Narcissus to kisse none but you, And in that christall Rivolet, your Eye Bury my Sight, my Selfe—tis life to dye.

Lend me thy Arrowes Cupid, teach me how To weare thy Quiver and to bend thy Bow, Shew me that Shaft in which a Power doth lye To make man chastly Love eternally; I have my eyes faire Boy with which Ile find The marke that thou wilt misse, las, thou art blind, I See too much, and wish I could not see, Lesse I had power my bondage for to free Or bind another; Theodorus then Should be my honour'd Prisoner once agen, Did I appeare so worthlesse, is my face So poorely barren of the Female Grace Which Courts our Amorous youth, that I must be The Subject of a mans Inconstancy, What though there be no Cupids in my Eyes, Plac'd to make Erring Love idolatrize, What though the Roses in my Cheekes doe faint, And I disdaine with an Adulterate paint To Adde a Sinnefull Beauty, my chaste minde Shall cast a lustre when all eyes are blind, That might have made my Theodorus Love With divine Loyalty, and constant proove, For Love that's onely fixed in faire Eyes And fading Colours, with their downefall dyes Beleeve me Theodorus, I divine, (Though thou art gone, and the sad losse is mine) Thou wilt not be a winner; Oh take heede Women are gilded follies, that exceed A gluttons Riot, Men doe oft refuse (For Beauties sake) though they unchastly chuse, If they be beautiously faire, can that Secure their Mindes from Thoughts adulterate, And should they lose their Honour, can they then With all their Beauties fetch it backe agen, But be your owne adviser, let not me Discourage your opinion, but be free In your new choice; if my wish take effect, You never shall repent you did neglect My courser Fortunes; if your Mistris be An Angell in your eyes, shees so to me, Envye is still my Enemy; although I lov'd you fondly, I must have you know Twas very chastly (too) and (without Wonder) Hearts may contract when Bodies are asunder. Yet love your Mistris, and be truely zealous, I can Affect, yet never make her jealous. A Morall Eclogue presented by Vertue, Wealth, and Beauty. Wealth. Come hither Beauty, what sad dumpe hath got The upper hand of thy choice thoughts, what blot Hath overcome thy Beauty; thou art sad, Thoughts discontented and conceal'd, make mad The serious Contemplator, then declare, Ime a Phisitian, tell me what they are. Beauty. Insatiate Wealth, I will; I come to crave Along-lost Servant, you unjustly have, And such a Servant none ere had but (shee Whom Iove embrac'd) Cadmean Semele, Though Nature make all men that mortall are All of one mould, shee can but claime a share In this great Master piece; ere he was fit Twelve Natures did in consultation sit, Had he but liv'd when the Egyptian Queene (Faire Cleopatra) Raign'd, to have beene seene, By her in her high court, sure none but he Had exchang'd places with Marke Anthony; Or Hellen veiw'd him, ere shee went from Greece, No Warres had beene, he could have kept the Peace. Wealth. Is this your cause of Griefe, admit I have This honourable Servant which you crave, I am the worthier Mistris, whats in you But a faire face, Riches doth me endue, What will your Beauty doe when Fortune shall Deale cruelly, and let your states both fall, Begge with your Beauty, can your Beauty then Contrive a meanes to raise you up agen. But stay, yonder comes vertue; doe but see How poore shee goes, yet shees as nice as thee. Vertue. Health to you Ladies; Beauty, unto you My message comes; I have a Servant true, Corrupted by your eyes, till he did see Your faining Smiles he was content with me; Pray give him backe againe: my mourning state Directs the Turtle that hath lost her Mate To beate her feather'd bosome, Griefe and I Are in contention for the Majesty Of perfect sorrow, and we finde that none Have such true griefe as those whose Love's are gone; Such is my state, faire Lady, doe not then Detaine my Love, but send him home agen. Beauty. What Love doe I detaine, what Servant, where Did I subdue him, whats his Character? Vertue. When first I did behold him, I could spye The simple Soule of Candid Majesty Take state in either cheeke; for his defence, He never Blush'd, but to shew Innocence: When he did court me, a sweete Passion strove To tell me, that he liv'd in perfect love, I saw he did, and yet am bold to tell, He might have wrought Faith in an Infidell, He had Exteriour Beauty, (too) his eyes Had luster from his inward Purities. They were a Frontispiece to all the good His Soule possessd; greater in Grace then blood; His name is Bellizarus, let me have His person (too) tis all the blisse I crave. Wealth. That is my Love coy Vertue. Beauty. Which I claime. Vertue. But is my due. Wealth. Oh ye both lose your Aime, He hath a wealthy Fortune, shall it be Exposed to the certaine jeopardy Of Beauty or poore Vertue; let him thrive In my esteemes, Wealth keepes the heart alive. Ile shew him Mynes of Treasure, which shall buy Pleasures, that may perswade Mortality Into a Godhead; Ile a Pallace build Of chequer'd Marble, whose large roofe shall yeeld Vnparalleld delights; a thousand boyes (Faire as Adonis) with melodious noyse Of new found Timbrils, shall awake his Sense From sullen sadnesse (with profuse expence,) Ile purchase curious dyet, whose choise taste Shall create Odors in his Breath, Ile waste My (unknowne) Treasure to a Myte, that he May hate you both, and keepe his Love with me. Beauty. You argue weakely for him; in my Eye, A Lover's Amorous Passion can descry Tenne thousand fairer boyes, young Cupids all, And with my voyce (at his commanding call) Ile warble various fancies, that shall make His heart; cold Melancholy quite forsake This Ruby Lippe being connex'd with his, Shall be more pleasing then that Nectar is Iove doth revive his Youth with; for his Scent, My breath is sweeter then that Continent The Phœnix keepes her nest in when she burnes In Aromats, and a New Phœnix turnes. These but a modell of the pleasures be He shall enjoy, let him returne to me. Vertue. If he be true, no argument should make His honest soule his first chast love forsake, Then (were he yours and I by strife should win) How could I be a vertue but a sin: Fond women, know ile teach him how to clime Beyond your hopes, to treasures more sublime; Ile shew him how to be content with that Would make you sorrowsicke and desperate: Fortune can wound you wealth, &amp; (beauty) know The sweetest Roses that doe fayrest blow, Will shatter into ruine; you must feare Beauty will fade, Springs last not all the yeare: You talke of Boyes and Cupids, I can see Through the pure cristalls of divinitie: A heaven set with Angels, of whose glory No mortalls pen could ere write perfect story, And to this joy ile bring him, if he be So wise to cast you off and live with me. Wealth. Yet he is mine, and if the God of love Looke pleasing (as he did) I then will move My next suite unto Hymen, and weele be Ioyntly contracted by his Deity: Do not you rayle then, not you tyre your heart, I have possession thats the greater part. Vertue. I must returne to sorrow, weepe, and wayle For his lost soule. Beauty. I to revenge, and raile. Vse your owne counsell, when your rayling's past Goe mourne with vertue and your beauty blast. The complaint of an old Lady for the losse of her beauty. Age (Beauties tyrant) why dost thou, Furrowe my brow? With what poyson hast thou made, My Lillies fade; What strange colour is this hayre That I weare? Oh for love's sake tak't away, Tis to gray; In my cheekes no Roses grow, Bud or blow; But are gone, for ever gone, Every one; In my eyes no Cupids dance To advance The bravery of Appetite To delight; I to Venus shrine will goe With my woe, And declare unto her all My beauties fall; There complaine that crooked Age Full of rage, Hath for ever banished White and red; So perhaps I may obtaine Allagaine. And disgracefull Age expell To her Cell; But if not, most sure I shall Ruin'd fall; For when beauty is away All's but Clay, Fickle feature growes but brave For a Grave, Where the beauty most repleate Wormes will eate. Go then Beauty be not seene But in Virgin's at sixteene, When they are as old as I Let their Beauty fading dye, Tis an age for to decline To our graves, not Venus shrine. A Gentleman deploring his former follies. Reason I doe salute thy brightnesse, thou Expellsts the mists of error; from thy brow A radiant Beame is shot into my soule, By which I have discovered how foule My former follies made me; it is thee That makst poore Man become a monarchy: Hadst thou been with me when the greedy grape Ingross'd my senses, and committed Rape Vpon my understanding, I might be Lesse in Arrerage for Ebriety. Had I enjoy'd thy company when I (Inflam'd with feaver-burning luxury) Ruin'd a Ladies fame, shee had beene pure And kept her mayden innocence secure; I had beene happy, for my tainted name Had beene an honest Character, no shame, Had I employ'd thy councell (when my wrath) Ayded by envy trod a guilty path Vnto my freinds confusion, but because He was not regular in Bacchus lawes, My spleene had beene more temperate, for I Had conquer'd rashnesse by sobrietie. Hadst thou bin present when my ruder tongue Calumniously did doe my Mistresse wrong, Who chastly loved when I did boldly say, Shee was my looser creature to alay Lascivious desires; that shee would doe What (heaven) knowes) I nere seduc'd her to, Thou hadst corrected the egregious ill, And I had liv'd her honor'd servant still. Hadst thou beene pleas'd ever to lend thy store Of saving helpe, such follyes on my score Had nere beene written, tis not yet too late For devoute penitence to expiate; Be my Adjutor, Reason tis in thee That I will seeke mans mediocritie. ELEGIACK POEMS. An Elegie on his Inestimable friend, M?. Richard Gunnell, Gent. Goe sell your smiles for weeping, change your mirth For mourning dirges, lave the pretious earth Of my inestimable friend with teares (Fertill as them the cheeke of Aprill weares, When Flora propagates her blessing on Th'approaching Daffadills) under this stone Lyes his neglected ashes, Oh that they Who knew his vertues best should let his Clay Lye unregarded so, and not appeare With a full sorrow, in each eye a teare Once, daily ore his urne, how can they thinke A pleasing thought, sit and securely drinke Insatiate carrowses; these are they Can lose both friends and sorrowes in one day (Not worth my observation) let me turne Againe to my sad duty, where ile mourne Till my corporeall essence doe become A glyding rivolet; and pay the summe To thy deare memory; my streame shall lend A drop to none les he hath lost a friend: The melancholly mad-man that will prove His passion for his Mistresse is but love, Were best be thrifty in his teares, for I Will not supply him though his mistresse dye; My ford is thine deare Gunnell and for thee My Christall Channell flowes so currently, Tagus and great Pactolus may be proud Of their red sands, let me my Rivers shrowd In course Meanders, where the waters shall In a griev'd murmure, Gunnell, Gunnell, call, It is for thee I flow, for thee I glide, I had retain'd my floods hadst thou not dyed. And little water birds shall chaunt this theame, Thy Iordan mourner is a Iordan streame. An Epitaph on his kind friend, M?. Iohn Honiman, Gent. Thou that couldst never weepe, and know'st not why Teares should be spent but in mans infancy, Come and repent thy error for here lyes A Theame for Angels to write Elegies, Had they the losse as we have; such a one As nature kild for his perfection, And when shee sends those vertues backe agen His stocke shall serve for twenty vertuous men. In Aprill dyed this Aprill to finde May In Paradise, or celebrate a day With some celestiall creature, had he beene Design'd for other then a Cherubin; Earth would have gave him choice; he was a man So sweetly good, that he who wisely can Describe at large, must such another be, Or court no Muses but Divinitie. Here will I rest, for feare the Readers eyes Vpon his urne become a Sacrifice. An Elegie on M?. Iohn Raven, Gent. No sooner did sad Rumour wound my eares With thy decease, but Myriads of teares Sprung in my fluent eyes, I sigh'd, Oh me Is Raven dead, why could the fatall THREE Not give some dispensation for a man Deserv'd the yeares of Nestor; I began Much to invoke the destinies, but they Gave me no answer, sure they doe obey Some greater power, whose immense soveraignty Admits no Inquisition How or Why; (The curse of frailty) we but see to chuse, Chuse to enjoy, ere we enjoy we lose: So is thy life to us, what if thou be Enthron'd a Monarch for thy piety, Our losse is still the same, we lose our prize, Because we cannot see thee with these eyes, We doe not doubt thy welfare (dearest friend) But doe beleeve thy meritorious end Hath won eternity, and yet indeed We cannot chuse but grieve, teares will exceed Though they allow no cause, for if thou be So truly happy as divinitie Declares the blessed transmigration, then Twere sinfull griefe to wish thee here agen: Thy death is my instruction, and thy blisse The subject of my contemplation is. Heaven inspire thy merit into me, And I shall dye, to deserve life with thee. An Elegie on his beloved friend M?. Charles Rider, Student in the Art of Limning, or Picture-drawing. If you can weepe, draw neere; but if your eyes Deny to yeeld a liquid Sacrifice, Laughter perplex yee, may you never be Worthy to be preserv'd in memory But amongst Fooles and Iesters, such as know No season for their mirth, but will allow Their idle jests, and their more anticke slights On Funeralls as well as Brydall nights. Here (you that have the magazin of teares) Exhaust your thrifty fountains, he that weares Black with an honest sorrow I advise To ayde us in our (too sad) obsequies. There is an Artist dead, who ist that can Deny but hee's the friend of every man That maks wise use of knowledg; he was rare In limning decent Figures; his chaste care Could nere permit his fancy to encline To the rude draughts of lustfull Aretine: But had his eyes beheld the silent feature, Posture &amp; face, of some excelling creature; (Pure as her simple Beauty) such a one Was patterne for his Pencill, or else none. To be particular, I should appeare Foe to my selfe, since each word claim's a teare; But what my full fraught eyes deny to show, Expect in some large booke in Folio. His vertues are too many for to be Composed in a weeping Elegie: But he is dead, that all-devouring death That scornes to give religious Monarchs breath An houre beyond his limits, hath thought fit To use his power on thee; may thy soule sit In Angells habitations, while we Deplore thy death, and blesse thy memory. Since thou wert meritorious, I crave That I may stick this Lawrel on thy grave, Where if the bounteous heavens please to raise Showres like my teares, twill grow a Grove of Bayes. An Elegie on the death of a Male-child drown'd in Ice. Blest Infant to thy Marble I am sent By pittying fate and my owne discontent, To be resolv'd, why (in thy budding youth) Thou wert thus rudely ravish'd, that the truth Vnto thy mourning friends I may relate, Who with their tears thy cold urne consecrate. How didst thou get thy ruine? what fate sent Thy beautious body to that element Devoures those it embraceth? couldst thou be Flatter'd to hugge the infidelity Of wanton Thetis? sure it was not so, Twas thy owne Beauty wrought thy overthrow; Shee was enamor'd of thee, and could finde No way but this to sate her ravenous minde. Shee did convert to Christall, for shee saw None but thy beauty, could thy beauty draw: For there thy eyes surpriz'd by their owne sight Eclips'd each other, making midday, night: Blacke night, worse waters, may yee ever be Vs'd to make beauty blacke, so curs'd by me; May never discontents or sorrowes rise In greefe-afflicted bosomes, if their eyes Bannish you thence, for when your floods are spent, There shall not be a cause for discontent: Rest peaceably (sweete boy) though to us dead, Iove shall for thee exchange his Ganemed. An Elegie and Epitaph on his Mistresse Fidelia. Patience (the great Physition of the minde) Hath lost his Art, for no balme can he finde To give me cure, there is no Patience left, It is a vertue which the gods bereft. With my Fidelia, and since shee is gone What good is left me, but distraction; Yet in her name I doe a vertue finde Charmes all my senses, tells my raging minde Shee hath but left the earth for heaven to try What throne the Gods prepare for shee and I. Which having done, I then shall heare from her By that supreame commanding Harbinger, That summons Princes, Queenes, religious Kings To cast off earth and put on Cherub's wings: My soule thus charmed into sweete content, Ile waite, and write thus on her monument. The Epitaph. In this Marble, buried lyes Beauty, may enrich the skyes, And adde light to Phœbus eyes. Sweeter then Aurora's ayre When shee paints the Lillyes faire, And gilds Cowslips with her haire; Chaster then the virgin Spring, Ere her blossomes shee doth bring, Or cause Philomell to sing. If such goodnesse live mongst men Bring me to it, I know then Shee is come from heaven agen; But if not, yee standers by Cherish me, and say that J Am the next design'd to dye. An Epicedium on his Mistresse Arbella. Yee are too quick, yee Pioners of death To execute your charge, I have yet breath Struggles within my labouring brest, to come And sigh an hasty Epicedium On my Arbella; Oh what stupid sleepe Ceazes your faculties, you doe not weepe Your selves to restlesse rivolets; my eyes Must act alone Arbella's obsequies; Doe you want common sense, how can you heare Arbella nam'd (dead nam'd) and shed no teare; Know you not how to weepe, pray looke on me, Methinks each man should be a Niobe, And teach me to be fluent: fall, oh fall Like Aprill dew, for these are Scythians all, And know not how to weepe unlesse the winds Ravish their teares; they have no weeping minds: But I am spent entomb, her now, yet stay, For pitties sake banish the wormes away, They will pollute her beauty; let them have A wealthy banquet in some Gluttons grave: Yet they may stay, for if they can descry Her beauteous cheekes, they will by famine dye, Rather then plucke those Roses, now growne white As was her innocence (before the light) Envied the lustre of her eyes, and sent Her beauty to enrich a Monument: Where (since her Saint-like essence is divine) I will forget her Tombe, and fix a Shrine.
